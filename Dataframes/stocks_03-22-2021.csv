03/22/2021,stocks,"I think it depends on valuation/what opening price is.  I know theyre pushing for quite a large number... Last I read they were looking at 10bn, when last June during fundraising they were valued at 2bn.  But I also think oat milk has room to grow in the market and Oatly by far the best IMO.

03/22/2021,stocks,There are literally 5 different brands of oat milk at every store here in the United States and all of them are cheaper than oatly.  I will say oatly taste the most like regular milk. I typically don't invest in food companies though. consumer preferences can change so fast and be forgotten in a month quickly.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Would you not agree that its far and away better than those other 5 brands?   Id be willing to throw money at it just for that.  

In LA it is the staple milk alternative in just about every independent coffee shop and nationally at starbucks.  Word will spread.  It will replace those other 5 brands. 

Because of sustainability issues, Oat milk will eventually overtake almond and soy milk.  And as OG people move more into non dairy milks,  they will also overtake cow milk and Oatly will be on top."
03/22/2021,stocks,Oh it's definitely the best of them all and the only one that comes close to real milk. I just don't touch consumer staples.

A company will start losing share price and at one point they’ll need to up the price of the stock to stay compliant. The company will reverse split the stock so that the price jumps up. Then the company needs capital so they’ll dilute by adding more shares. All the while the share price keeps tanking. That way the price might be $20 at the current time but with all the shenanigans, the share price 5 years ago would look like a juggernaut.

03/22/2021,stocks,"The bond yield increasing is not bad for the market! It is actually a very good thing for our whole system. The problem is that a ton of people are leveraged into speculative plays that are not profitable (which is why there is a bunch of negative sentiment). These companies have to borrow money in the debt market to continue operating - they do this through corporate bond offerings (or share dilution in the equity market), this comes with the promise that the company will pay their creditors back in a few years at a certain APR. If interest rates in the medium/long-term go up, then it becomes more difficult for these companies to grow, since they’ll have to pay more of their income in interest payments, rather than continued growth. They can avoid this by writing shorter dated bonds, but they’ll have to be able to repay the entirety of the loan sooner, rather than later, which has it’s own slew of issues.

The bond yields also affect a lot more than just what companies can borrow money it, it also affects - student loans, mortgages, savings accounts, margin loans, basically any loan you can get in the US."

Id stay away from this one personally. Wine sales were up last year due to the pandemic, Id guess they will be flat or shrink slightly for the sector this year. Wineries reopening for tasting is not really a huge factor in overall profit or revenue. 

This is at a low multiple for a reason, where is the growth going to come from? Are they acquiring other vineyards? Buying other peoples grapes? If that's the case its more than likely just for the wholesale type wines with low margin. 

The numbers I would like to see would be total wine production (cases) and average price and profit per. Thats how I would be tracking the growth of the company. I dont see the value or the growth in the name at this time."

However, in general, you will sell your contracts.  So, you will buy a contract to open, stock goes up, and then you will sell a contract to close.

03/22/2021,stocks,"You do what makes money. Are you greedy?

Remember, if you exercise the call you are only buying 100 stock at the strike price. This in no way means you make any money. If you exercise a call the only way to make money is to sell the stock higher than the strike.

Most options are traded rather than exercised. This way you don't have to worry about buying and selling stock and there is risk there. The goal is to minimize risk/uncertainty. 

Would you rather have one bird in the hand or two in the bush?"
03/22/2021,stocks,If you were to exercise the call you would be entitled to buy 100 shares of the stock at 28. This means you have to have the capital to buy 100 shares at 28. you could of course sell these for a profit. The more common occurrence is to just sell the option.  This is probably better and what most people choice because you don't have to hold the shares and then sell them. Also I believe your gains would be the same whether you exercised or sold the option. I could be wrong on that factor

03/22/2021,stocks,"It is a risk / reward / greed thing.  If you sell and it continues a bullish run to 50, you will not make as much.

&#x200B;

> If the option expires and you didn’t do anything. Does it automatically sell to close or does it get assigned to you? 

Assignment is if you are short / write a contract.  Which is a totally different thing.  And, if you are new, you probably shouldn't do that right away until you do a few easier positions for awhile.  It can be very dangerous and is more advanced (just my 2cents).

Exercising is what you would want to do if you held the option ITM into expiration of the contract.  Some brokers will do this automatically exercise for you - it depends on the broker and their policies.

But, in general, unless you have an advanced strategy, you probably don't want this to happen because, in the case of calls, you have to buy the shares and take delivery of the shares into your account.  It's easier just to the sell the contract to close and be done with the position."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Depends on how long you see yourself investing. The way I see it, it's a bigger risk NOT being invested. Low rates, and steepening inflation = less buying power, if your money are just kept in a bank account.

How your portfolio should look like is up to you. How much risk do you want to take? If you feel you know too little to make self justified individual stock purchases, go for a global fund, or spy if you just want US exposure.

Since you are young, I'd recommend taking more risk."
03/22/2021,stocks,">I was considering the following investment strategy until I feel educated enough to make smart investments:

>25-40% SPY

>25-40% VOO

SPY and VOO are exactly the same thing, both ETFs tracking the S&P 500. SPY is managed by State Street and VOO is managed by Vanguard. there's no reason to have both, so pick one based on whichever has the lower fee or is available through your brokerage. 

otherwise, you're on the right track IMO. I would not classify Wells Fargo as high-risk, the others probably are relatively high-risk, but if you didn't know anything about Wells Fargo that's a form of risk. 

as you know from reading the book, Lynch is the exact opposite of a FOMO investor. he had a preference for boring or unglamorous companies, something that seems superficially dull or even mildly disgusting but is actually a low-debt, well-managed, money-printing machine. not sure which of his two books it's in, but he talks about how Crown Holdings was one of his best stock picks ... they make bottle caps and cork stoppers. Not exciting. Everyone was chasing high-tech in the 1980s, just as now, but he made a killing with Dunkin' Donuts, Taco Bell and various regional bank stocks. Boring is good. Most people don't want to invest in boring, they're chasing trends and over-paying for the privilege."
03/22/2021,stocks,"There is a difference between investing and trading. Investing is boring and is a long term plan. Trading is exciting and moving stocks around and trying to time the market and trends. My best performing portfolio is one from a job I left many years ago, I had placed the investments in some ETFs and let them ride. 

My suggestion, if you want to grow wealth look long term and place the majority of your money in good stocks and ignore them.

 You can still have fun,but do it separately. I have $1,500 'play money' that I use for some meme stocks and options, I haven't had much success but it's been fun and it's a learning experience."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I would say you made the right decision to sell  - I'm sure you're familiar with Lynch's key principle of 'Know What You Own'.

As to your question, it really depends on how long you think it will take you to feel knowledgeable enough to start choosing individual stocks again. Would it take 6 months, or 3 years?

If you're just hoping to catch a bull run this year and then sell the funds/stocks, in my opinion that would be even more risky than just sitting out until you're ready. You might think they're 'safe' investments that you can sell for a profit in the near future (or at least break even), but they could just as easily go lower and stay down this year as well.

My advice would be figure out how much of that money you would feel comfortable putting into 2-3 of your highest conviction stocks, and set that aside. Then in the meantime, start averaging into diversified funds with the rest of your money.

Good luck whatever you decide, and you certainly seem to have a lot more sense than many investors twice your age."

03/22/2021,stocks,">25-40% SPY  
>  
>25-40% VOO  
>  
>20%-50% 3-5 well known respectable blue chips stocks such as (JPM,COST,JNJ,DIS).

Your goal is to have a modest growth strategy until you've completed your education and feel more confident in your ability to pick individual stocks.   

Since SPY and VOO both track the S&P500, there is no reason to own both of them.  Either EFT is fine.  

**100% SPY or 100% VOO is the simplest ""set it and forget it"" portfolio.**  You get all the biggest, most stable companies in 1 holding, and you don't need to worry about rebalancing, or keeping tabs on companies while you're studying. 

You probably don't need to own large individual blue chips like JNJ or DIS at this stage of the game, unless you feel strongly about one of these companies.

>I'm a big believer in the investing philosophies of people such as Munger, Buffet, and Lynch (but I'm also learning more about other famous investors).

It may also be interesting to look at investors and strategies that flopped, such as Janus funds during the dotcom crash, and Collateralized Debt Obligations prior to the Great Financial Crisis.  You can sometimes learn as much from the losers (what to avoid) as the winners.

Finally, nobody knows what the future will hold.  As successful as people like Buffet and Lynch have been, there's no guarantee that their strategies will have the same effect going forward.  Exercise your own judgment."

03/22/2021,stocks,"This has been brought up several times in the last few weeks.  Someone with a little more technical knowledge than me can explain better, but it's nothing nefarious.  From what I remember, it's simply trades that were made during the day being settled at market close."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Volume doesn't mean any price movement. If a share is bought it has to be sold, the price does not have to change at all. Price is effected by supply and demand which has to do with the price(yes, it is recursive). The options market and other factors can set the price but volume doesn't tell you that. It tells you how active the stock is being traded. A lot of vol means that the stock is trading hands a lot. It means a lot of winning and losing going on. (although one can win and then turn around and lose and be tied and it won't measure that)

When a stock as a lot of vol it means that a lot can happen. When there is no volume generally little can happen(such as pre market/after hours). Generally when there is volume it means one can make(or lose) money based money is flowing. When there is no volume one can't easily make money."
03/22/2021,stocks,That looks like a short close. If you got L2 and can see a really big sell ceiling you can easily use it to buy a bunch of shares and close out. Been seeing a lot of these lately. This is very effective in afterhours if you can get a big player to paperhand everything they have. It gets really fun if the sell side runs out of shares and shorts have to scramble to re-short so the price doesn’t blow up.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Thanks, this makes sense. So this would mean than 1.9M shares must have been sitting on the ask at that exact price point? I was watching it through close and didn't see that"

The internet in general is so full of promotional trash. I almost want to recommend books at this time but even a lot of those are just trying to either sell you something or trying to get you to think a certain way.

Edit: sorry if this is a useless reply but there are so many hype traps it’s insane"

I started two months ago only knowing meme stocks but since then I've taken my initial $200 investment down to $166 

Now that may seem like a loss but after taking a lot of my free time reading reddit and trying to do the best reads on various stock I'm getting more confident in some picks while others are still gambles

You almost have to invest in reading about stocks and the market like another job in your free time"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Read a lot but regardless of how much you read you need experience in the market. It took me 5 years of trading to become consistently profitable, however, I choose a high risk approach so it was a much more painful route.

If you have a genuine interest in investing and the markets then with time you will figure things out and find what works for you.

I can only speak about my own experience but I found that there's no cookie cutter approach you kind of have to discover your own style. I'm just a retail trader though and I also found that accepting that I will always be a small fish benefited my portfolio immensely."

It’s not talked about anywhere so it doesn’t have the WSB pump and dump traction. Only 215 watchers on stock twits and quietly becoming a 1B cap.

03/22/2021,stocks,Don’t really see why Dave and busters is valued at $55. I thought $46 was too high because that’s what they were before the pandemic. Now they have to stop giving dividends and have way more debt. I get that the they are reopening but they only have 2 new stores and I believe they closed down 1 store so I don’t see why they’d be at a very high price for their stock.
03/22/2021,stocks,"It's a valid opinion, if youre interested you should see what the analyst's rationale was for that price target"
03/22/2021,stocks,I’ll check it out but I’m assuming it’s because of the reopening. I just don’t see that much growth in Dave and busters I initially invested at $12 because they were a large company and were undervalued and gave nice dividends but now I think the industry is becoming a little too hyped up to be completely honest. I sold an October covered call I think they will stay below $50 because of debt and reduction of dividends.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I did some light research, I agree with you reduction of dividend and debt is not a great sign. The stock has been surging like crazy, but could be due to hype. It seems like a decent company, but in my opinion, there are better reopening plays out there."

03/22/2021,stocks,The price hike happened when the merger was first announced. Perhaps the day of they’ll move slightly upward but it’s going to depend on the current news/media. Unfortunately nowadays stock prices are more about the media coverage and less about the company’s financial performance.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Uh, less than 6 months ago apha was at $4... its hovering around and often over $20 currently. Thats a rather large increase homie."

03/22/2021,stocks,"I hate to say it since I hold 2000 shares at $31, but I think APHA at $20 is already pretty impressive. They would need to have a killer ER, hyped up merger, and amazing market news to go anywhere above $30.

It'd probably happen in 2 yrs. But I'm not expecting it to happen in 1 month."
03/22/2021,stocks,Loving that date for APHA
03/22/2021,stocks,"Apha has been climbing, TLRY too, however it's at the moment all hype.  The deal for the merger is a catalyst, but there are other catalysts still holding things up.  I think the largest issue is federal legality in the US so the banks can all accept their business.  This could change soon, but it's going to depend on how many GOP members come around, otherwise it will be used as ammo against GOP members in the midterms.  Let's hope we don't have to wait, but it's clear a lot of GOP members do not give a shit about what the people want.  

In case some conservative fuckwad wants to claim partisanship here, show me your GOP reps moving it, because I can show you a turtle fucker who kills it every time."
03/22/2021,stocks,I am holding apha. I like it alot. but this might just be their value. although APHA should close closer to that .8381 ratio before the merger.

In other words, it's not happening lmao.

Since when has not-legalizing weed *ever* cost the GOP a seat?  I know plenty of Republican voters want it legalized, but it's been shown they will vote against their own interest time and time again if it keeps a democrat out of office. 

Midterms are going to be rough for the Democrats as they'll need to defend seats in Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia that they only won by slim margins, and that's just the Senate.  No amount of ""Republicans are blocking legalization!"" cries are going to have right-wing voters see the light and switch sides."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Right, they have been trading exactly at that ratio. A little of today TLRY 23.79 * .8381 = APHA 19.93. APHA is at 18.78.

03/22/2021,stocks,"I wrote up a whole thing about why I think the GOP is done, but I can sum it up with young people.  GOP may be popular in certain areas, but young people like weed and are living through this pandemic and absorbing the brunt of it in many ways.  Deliberately stalling government may have been what the boomers want, but they don't got much to care about in 20 years.  The GOP's old base, which is a lot larger than it's young base is dying out.  There will always be holdouts, but as a younger and more educated generation move to vote, it is inevitable.  GOP at some point needs to get on the right side of popular and successful policy or they are not going to exist.  I think the next generation sees the world more like Mark Kelly than Rand Paul."

Major catalysts (things that might increase stock price a lot) Bidens new infrastructure plan and China cutting steel exports to limit pollution (look up Tangshan).

Other things: HRC futures are high and seem to be high up till next year.

03/22/2021,stocks,best investment at your age is one which increases earning potential. worth even more than getting your 401k/ira contributions in.
03/22/2021,stocks,You are already way ahead of most people your age. Bravo!
03/22/2021,stocks,In the bank
03/22/2021,stocks,"Without knowing anything about your financial situation (savings, current income, etc.) it's probably sensible to stick the money into the bank account for the upcoming months, buy a cheap car and set the rest aside for a rainy day fund. Once that is built to a sufficient degree go back to investing. And even then consider the already given advice of the others by sticking a chunk of your investment into ""fool proof"" solutions (like ETFs). Personally I can't stress enough to rather stick money into the securities, rather than the car, because they won't decrease in value, while the car will. Or at least the car certainly won't increase in value, while the others might /probably will.

As always, no need to follow my opinion; definitely am not a financial advisor. Just throwing in my two cents worth."
03/22/2021,stocks,"You might try putting it in NUSI, which is a covered call ETF that uses puts for downside protection.  It is paying 7.6% at the moment.   This will pay a lot better than a bank account. It would take a shit-hit-the-fan event to lose significantly on, and in that case you might not want to be buying a car anyway."
03/22/2021,stocks,yeah i think this is the smartest move too. it’s just so painful thinking of everything i could miss out on.
03/22/2021,stocks,Agreed ^

OP... would reducing your investment of 100% w-2 income to say 50% whike going and mowing lawns on the weekends or some side gig and taking that second income with the first to buy a car be more tangible

3. all cash

03/22/2021,stocks,"Based on your original post, I'm thinking you are pretty young...would you mind sharing your age?  The reason I ask is, most young people...hell most people in general...do not think about the future and what they could have if they save now, they think about how to get things now and pay for them later.  What caused you to think this way?  Parenting?  School (haha)?  I was almost 35 years old before I stopped doing the consumer debt thing, and while I've always put money into the market via 401k plans, I really didn't focus on it and put more effort into it until almost 40.  Thinking back on where I could be now if I had that mindset 20 years ago churns my stomach, but at least I figured it out before 60!"

03/22/2021,stocks,"I'm late 30s and have never budgeted. Budgets are an artificial constraint on those who can't control themselves. Think about things in terms of cash flow - will this generate income for me, or happiness - will this generate x happiness for me over its lifetime.

 Generally a dollar spent today will be worth far more when you get older if you had invested it, but you're young, so invest in yourself and have some fun. If you're going to invest, just dump it all in a total stock fund. Don't try and pick stocks and risk losing it when total stocks invested early and often will set you up very nicely for an early retirement."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Your a smart person, I’m sure you’ll figure this out. We are a bunch of old folks trying to right out wrongs. To be 16 with a 6mo savings is ridiculous. 
Save some for college unless your getting a scholarship or parents paying. Invest long term like you are continuously. Then enjoy the rest. If you can create the habit now of always investing/saving 20% and living off 80% you’ll be guiding these conversations instead of asking questions."
03/22/2021,stocks,In that case I would save up enough to be able to buy the car specifically from your checking alone and don't touch your stocks. Tech is so up and down in 2021 it isn't worth the risk
03/22/2021,stocks,"At your age just steadily create a percentage mix with something like 50-60% VOO, 30% VXUS, maybe 5% bonds, and then the rest in safe-ish stocks and industry ETFs you like. 

Have a 6 month savings account.  Buy a reliable car and drive it into the ground over the years (it's a depreciating asset so rinse/ repeat), put 5% of your check into a travel fund (or more into VTI to get interest) to see the world.  Don't spend lots of money on useless stuff that will seem frivolous when you look back on it in 3-5 years, like gold chainz or Funko Pops. Lol

Take any chance you can to up skill, and for god sakes do NOT get a useless degree from a bullshit university."
03/22/2021,stocks,"4-5k at 16 is gonna be a decently nice used car, but you will still want to watch out for repair costs too. That is the same price range as my first “expensive” car and I quickly had about $1000 in maintenance within the first year"
03/22/2021,stocks,"This is great man. Your in high school. You are buying a cash car. You have a job. Soon you’ll have gas and insurance to worry about. 
Your doing thing great. As mentioned before. For my advise to you. Am these next 4 weeks out 10% in the market a week and buy less stock but keep investing. The car MIO (maintenance: oil changes, tires, wiper blades, filters etc. //insurance// and operating costs:Gas) will probably take up 20-25% of your future income. Plus the fun of being a kid. It’s easy to stop contributing to investments to get the right now stuff but if you continually contribute 10% you’ll build wealth. When you want something or to go somewhere it’ll be planned because that 10% will always be going into your account. Dm me if you have any questions."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I did a dual degree in English and Business, and worked really hard at investing when I was in my 20s.  I joined an investment club, and had to present DD to the club each week, and we voted on where to put assets.

I was religious about 401k and matching.  Everything was great until about 32 years old.  Then, the post-Y2K recession hit.  The Colorado IT market fell apart.  People started moving out, you couldn't get a full time or contractor job anywhere.  People who had been at $85K now couldn't get $15/hour jobs.

I had to choose between losing my house and liquidating my retirement.

Nobody really teaches you that.

Then, with a subsequent decade of contractor gigs, and unemployment in-between, I reached 48 with only $60,000 in retirement.  You can do all of the right things, but success is never guaranteed."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Well i mean it sounds like you do budget but you do so mentally and on the fly, which is perfectly reasonable and effective  for those who can do it

The written down budget people force themselves to use is because they cant keep track of all their spending and earnings in their head at short notice. If you dont run into that issue then theres almost no reason to actually write out a budget ever, if at a moments notice you can identify whether or not you can reasonably afford to (or *want* to) buy something based on your short and longterm needs, *thats* budgeting"
03/22/2021,stocks,Don’t use margin and definitely don’t use margin on ETFs.
03/22/2021,stocks,Only relevant if you invest on margin.

Follow up question.  Can I even buy these if my account is below TD's $2k margin account requirement?
Say I have only $600 free cash in my account, I could still buy $600 worth of a leveraged ETF?  This warning only applies if I'm buying on margin?"

03/22/2021,stocks,"VOOG is a much higher Tech percentage than VOO. It has historically been higher because Tech has been booming so much. So the question is, how sure are you on the Tech boom. That will determine if you trust VOOG more or VOO. VOOG is 40+ percent vs VOO at 20 percent"
03/22/2021,stocks,"VOOG has been ahead of VOO over the last few years, but look at VOOV vs. VOO or VOOG since the start of the year. VOOV is out ahead. we're in a shift from growth stock dominance to value stock dominance. 

or look over the past 20 years, if the data goes back that far. you'll see a different story."
03/22/2021,stocks,More risk in VOOG. It will do better when things are going up and worse when they go down.

Maybe in 50 years it potentially could do something but not likely given the current state of the technology

03/22/2021,stocks,A reason I think TSLA wont be around for long is once the other auto makers start making cheap electric cars like VW recently released the ID4 that seems to be pretty reasonably priced and of course the Chevy bolt and Nissan Leaf and many more electric cars coming in the next few years with better quality and lower priced. TSLA will go out of buisness
03/22/2021,stocks,"although I really like CIIC, I dont get how it is relevant to the first answer? Or you mean eletric vehicle in general?"
03/22/2021,stocks,That's because those are two different accounts/people. I think what OP meant in their comment was to find out what tech existing manufacturers are either interested in using or are already beginning to use. I.e. If you found out that two very large companies with massive supply chains are looking to exclusively use blackberry for their cyber security then you can likely bet that companies in their supply chain will join in to satisfy the security concerns of their main customer.

03/22/2021,stocks,The stocks I’m trading have most of their gain in the premarket so I limit sell. I’m on the app that the sidebar warns against mentioning 😔
03/22/2021,stocks,"China's bond yield is a little over 3%, which might be a con."
03/22/2021,stocks,Yes I believe that's true. I'm pretty new to this stuff though so I might be wrong
03/22/2021,stocks,"People that need a house, and can afford a house, are going to buy a house.

If the cost of that house goes up 10%, they are still going to buy it if they can afford it.

If the cost of the house goes up 10%, so do the commissions that get paid to real estate companies.

Zillow has something going on where they themselves purchase houses and resell them.  I know somebody that moved from Las Vegas a few years ago, that sold his house to zillow. Zillow marked the price up and resold it. So in this context, zillow would make more money.

To my knowledge, Zillow still allows people to list houses for sale for free. They do charge about $10 a week to list a house for rent now though.  So I don't see an increase in house costs benefiting them in this department."
03/22/2021,stocks,No it means that homes aren’t on the market very long. Low volume is fine as long as demand is high. Think about a car dealership for a moment- would you rather have a parking lot full of new cars or to have each shipment of new cars sold out immediately?
03/22/2021,stocks,Supply and demand is the reason for prices going up
03/22/2021,stocks,"Your logic is sound, unless they get paid percentage of the sale (prices go up means more profit per sale but overall volume goes down) so the question would then be does profit per sale outweigh the volume drop"
03/22/2021,stocks,Thank you for the input!
03/22/2021,stocks,"interesting point, I need to go find some volume data"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I have a cousin who is a real estate agent and he tells me he doesn't care much about the housing prices, he cares more about the volume.  I mean the price changes of houses will probably hover around 10% change, it won't double or half the value in a month.  However, the volume of house sales can easily double or half in a month.  I would imagine the volume drop will hurt a lot more than the price increase."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I I mean the two are completely different, the s&p is a sfe investment but you won't get double digits, and tesla is a very risky investment I mean it just is and anyone who holds it should agree so idk man it just depends on what you want safe or risky"

03/22/2021,stocks,"How old are you? The answer should determine your investment strategy. If you're young, then you can afford a riskier investment strategy. I wouldn't follow Cathy Woods. A lot of new investors lost due to emotion and have 0 clues of what companies they're holding and bought on the hype. Cathy Woods and her team did the research on these companies, and have a better understanding of these companies she's holding than the sheeps following her. Whenever a crash happens, she'll buy more of the companies with the highest convictions and these sheep will sell at a loss cause their investment or ""gambling"" just dropped 30% in value. Always do your own research on any company you want to hold, so you don't freak out on red days."
03/22/2021,stocks,"The thing about SPY that is nice is that it has some Tesla but a small percentage. So if Tesla does well it gets a small bump from that percentage, but if Tesla doesn't do well, it isn't hurt as badly. With your situation the way it sounds, I would probably just bet on SPY and put in income monthly into it (what you are willing to lose). Then just wait it out and allow the dividends and compound interest to build on itself"
03/22/2021,stocks,"it's good you're paying attention after Gamestop. but putting all your chips on one stock, hoping it blows up, is not a good strategy. that's like buying lotto tickets. anything like GME or Tesla that shoots straight up is bound to come down, and often come down hard all at once. ALVR is not a good option, they have a lot of cash, but are unprofitable and it's crazy overvalued. fair value for the stock is actually negative according to the discount cash flow calculator at Guru Focus. https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ALVR/dcf (TL;DR - the price of a stock may or may not accurately represent the value of the company, and best case you want to buy undervalued stocks. it's like buying a used car. You look in Kelly Blue Book or Edmunds to get an idea what a used car is worth ... say $8,000 to $11,000 for a used Toyota Whatever. best case you find one in good shape for $7,000. in good condition, you might pay $12,000. but you're not gonna pay $30,000 for a car with a fair value of $11,000. but people over-pay for stocks all the time.)

if you don't have any stocks, you want to start with a low-fee fund or ETF that gives you broad exposure to the US market. something like SPY, VOO, VTI, IWB or FZROX. these will have hundreds or thousands of stocks, you'll own a little slice of America to borrow Warren Buffett's phrase. this will be extremely safe over the long term, even boring. 

for good advice on picking single stocks, read Peter Lynch's books, the Little Book of Value investing by Christoper Browne, or the Little Book that Beats the Market by Joel Greenblatt. the authors are all successful professional investors, and they would all tell you to avoid trendy-overpriced stocks like ALVR. they will all tell you to look for boring, well-managed profitable companies with low levels of debt, and with a stock that's fairly priced or under-priced. 

>would mean I’m free of all of society’s BS and social class oppression and inequality

""social class oppression and inequality""? you need to stay off late stage capitalism or whatever websites are filling your head with these ideas. it's nonsense and it's poisoning your mind. go read Immigrant Mindset by Brian Buffini, and you'll learn why immigrants to America are about 4x more likely to become millionaires than native-born Americans: Immigrants see America for the amazing nation that it is, with more opportunities than most people in the world have access to. 

a lot of the talk about income inequality is hogwash. they're confusing income brackets (an abstract category) with the flesh and blood people. the trouble is that the brackets are not fixed, we all slide in and out of income brackets all through our lives. 

an absolute majority of Americans are in the bottom 20% of income, and the top 20% of income ... only at different times in their lives. see Economic Facts and Fallacies by Thomas Sowell. 

50% of Americans spend at least a year in the top 10% by income, and about 10% of Americans spend a year in the top 1%. the top 1% has the highest turnover rate of any income bracket in the United States. see Skin in the Game by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

03/22/2021,stocks,"username checks out.  it's cathie wood, FYI"
03/22/2021,stocks,Perfect! So it’s definitely garbage then
03/22/2021,stocks,"It's per share. On average, you didn't have a loss, but you obviously have some shares sold at a loss and some at a gain. Those sold at a loss are washed, those sold for a gain have their cost basis adjusted. If you re-calculate your gains using the adjusted basis, everything will work itself out. You can report $5 gain summarized, or every single individual buy & sell transaction with washed sales and adjusted cost basis. It will all end up the same."
03/22/2021,stocks,"If you sold shares for less than you paid, you lost. Doesnt matter if you sold in 1 batch for more than average cost (i.e. net gain)"
03/22/2021,stocks,"That makes sense.

How do people usually deal with this?  Is there a limit on how long the original price is a factor?

If I bought 1 share for $991 and then 99 shares for $1 it seems crazy that I’d have to wait until the price per share is $991 or higher to avoid the penalty.

Guess this is what I get for daytrading hah."
03/22/2021,stocks,What is the penalty? I thought the wash loss is subtracted from subsequent gain and there is no net change in total
03/22/2021,stocks,"Bottom line none.  It just looks weird on my list of positions.  I originally bought @26 then 16 and 17 which put me at a cost basis around 19 when I sold and the I rebought today at 18 and my chart shows it as a wash sale with a $60 loss and a really funky cost basis that makes it look like I lost money when I didn’t.

My cost basis is about 30% higher than the price of the stock I just bought so I guess now I’m just stuck until it reaches this new price or it will forever trigger a wash?  Or just exit position and wait the 31 days?  Are those my only options?"
03/22/2021,stocks,I’d just buy 100% VOO for set and forget tbh
03/22/2021,stocks,"I would shy away from a 529 and just use a generic brokerage account and then pay it out to him when he turns of age on a semester to semester basis. The reasons why are:

It varies state to state on what the rules are for 529’s. Some states allow you to take tax deductions for the contributions you make. If your state offers no tax deduction, I would definitely not use a 529. There are no federal tax deductions currently for contributing to 529’s. 

Additionally, some state sponsored plans allow you to use the money at whatever college you choose, even out of state colleges, which is nice, but other prepaid plans do not. I would not use a prepaid 529 because of this.

There are penalties if you do not use the funds for education expenses (10% + ordinary income tax rate) unless the beneficiary received a scholarship. If that were the case, you can take out the scholarship amount.

You may be subject to gift tax if you deposit more than the gift amount allowed in a single year, which is currently $15k.

If you invest too much into the 529 plan it’s theoretically locked up and will be subject to the penalty (10%) plus ordinary income tax rate to withdrawal.

The major reason though is you don’t know the future cost of college or if it will be free one day. Although I don’t agree with it, a lot of politicians are pushing for free college.

Also, with a brokerage account you can use margin funds to leverage yourself to have even more returns. I don’t believe you can do any margining with a 529 plan.

*Opinions are my own and shall not be taken as financial advice."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Just put it in a separate account screw the 529 what happens if they decide they don’t want to go to college, you could use it for a house down payment or something else instead, maybe they want to start a business. Or maybe they grow up and turn into a total A-hole you can just keep your money. Lol  I have a couple 529 for my kids but quickly stopped funding them and changed to just setting up custodial accounts for them instead. Sure I don’t get the tax savings but I’m not limited to what they can spend it on personally I hope they save it so they have a big jump on a retirement fund.  Not advice, good luck either way sounds like a lucky nephew"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yea I’d do VOO like he said or 2 ETF’s covering different sectors, might wanna hold off on anything tech"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I'd like to hop in on this thread.  I just opened a 529 through fidelity.  Once i funded it they bought me 100+ shares of something called 'NH2036000' (NH PORTFOLIO 2036 (FIDELITY FUND PORT).  Can anyone explain this to me? Is it just a fidelity managed fund of some kind?  Can i change what the 529 is invested in myself?  Also how does it work, the + or - in $ seems to only change once a day?"
03/22/2021,stocks,The age-based allocations are nice for simplicity's sake.
03/22/2021,stocks,"VTI + VXUS imo

ex-US companies have been lagging last decade but they are projected to mybe even beat US companies in the next decade because of the super high valuations in America"
03/22/2021,stocks,With the 529 you are limited on the securities you can purchase. In some states they are the ones that determine what is available to buy. I would check with your broker to see what they offer.
03/22/2021,stocks,"If you are investing for college only (some states allow you to use the funds for private school pre-college I believe) then you're talking almost 20 years from now.  I don't think you need to be low risk based on that time frame, but your broker should offer differing strategies, similar to how retirement accounts are handled.  For instance, I have a 529 for my daughter through Fidelity, and I have it spread across two Aggressive ranked funds, and one Moderate ranked fund."
03/22/2021,stocks,"VOO.

Now, on an utterly crazy non-stock idea, google “teak investment Panama”. You can literally buy a grove of trees that in 20 or 25 years will be harvested and pay out.  A tangible and insured asset.  My fourteen month olds each have a bit of land in their name (fallback to each other and then to us) doing just that.  But I have that timed for when they turn 25, and are getting started in life.  I don’t really plan on telling them either.  Surprise!"
03/22/2021,stocks,I would put it into 100% equities. You've got a long time horizon - you want to take ample risk not attempt to minimize here.
03/22/2021,stocks,"might want to move to a more conservative allocation when he hits 15 or 16 years old. but starting at 1 year old you want to be all stocks for at least the next decade. 

I'd hesitate to go 100% S&P 500. I'd add some low-fee international options, odds are we're gonna see international out-performing the US for a while. it's long overdue. 

>What ETFs should I consider?

that will depend on who manages the 529 plan. they might not have ETFs available, might be all mutual funds. which will amount to the same thing if you can do 60% S&P 500 and 40% low-fee international index."
03/22/2021,stocks,Agreed
03/22/2021,stocks,He is named after me so there’s that. I see your point for a custodial account though.
03/22/2021,stocks,Some states limit what can be purchased using a 529.
03/22/2021,stocks,"The 529 also pissed me off because I wanted my kids to be able to donate to it as well Christmas birthdays work etc. but they charged $50 fee to buy it every time made no sense first my kid needed to save like $500 then it cost them 10% basically just to break even. So I just switched to schwab custodial now they can throw in $50 whenever they want easy for them to check it and such. So they can learn about it at young age. As for original question which ETFs for my kids I go pretty bland and safe I do IVV , IJH, VB  then let them pick like 5 random funds they like for about 1% each of portfolio. I do zero bonds but I’ve never saw the point of bonds at this age"
03/22/2021,stocks,If u have fidelity just call them they will answer ur questions and help u set it up.

03/22/2021,stocks,Do a few Google searches and educate yourself. The money in these accounts will grow to become one of your biggest assets and support your lifestyle during retirement.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Agreed, they are very helpful and typically answer the phone quickly.  They will answer your questions, and even guide you on the site where to look for funds to buy, but I don't think they can actually execute trades for you without charging you a fee.  Fidelity's website isn't the greatest in the world, but it isn't horrible either.  Once you figure it out, you can set up a recurring EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) from your bank account to your Fidelity account, and then you can set up automatic investments once you find the fund or funds you like."

03/22/2021,stocks,I do the same. I lock in the gains either way. Gains are gains. Doesnt matter what youre in it with
03/22/2021,stocks,"I mean I like diversification but I think about it in percentage points. 80$ out of 40k its not even worth it to have to keep track of such a small investment. If you had 1k then yeah buying a share here or a share there is what you could afford to do. 40k I would probably at least stick to 500-1000$ investments, but thats just me. The expensive shares are a little different. Like I have 3 shares of GOOGL...I can't afford 40 shares...so I have 3 because thats still a decent percentage of the money I use for individual shares (the bulk of my investments are in funds). 330 for costco I could see only having a couple shares with 40k to invest."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I have 1 share of Nintendo.  I like the stock.  It is not going to make me rich, it's not my kid's college or my retirement made manifest.  When I look at my portfolio, and I see my boring boomer stuff, I see whatever dipshit move I'm losing money trying currently, and then I see Mario.  When Mario is green, I'm happy.  When Mario is red, I hope little buddy gets better soon.

TLDR;  Not each and every stock has to be a swing for the fences.  You're an adult, and it's your money.  My only caution would be if you have 1-2 shares of many different things, could you maybe have a bigger position on fewer things you absolutely believe in?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"If you just acquire stocks eventually it will totally be worth it. I wouldn’t try to day trade with 10 shares, but that would be a great way to build wealth over time."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I'm new to investing but also having to change my mindset i feel.  Theoretically a company can go under and be literally worthless ($0) but i feel that is unlikely if you are buying a stock for a real reason.  So to me its not just about the ""gain/profits"" its also that i'm not spending that money on something else, and one day later on i can take it out if i absolutely need it.  So even if it doesn't go up huge, or even goes down (some) it's still worth ""something"".  Better than just blowing that money on random shit thats literally worthless after i buy it.  You might have 40k invested in ""random"" stocks but hell its still 40k invested."
03/22/2021,stocks,Got to start somewhere. Even if only a few shares.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I’m in the same boat, although I only have a quarter of the budget of your portfolio. I try to keep most of my dozen holdings at 5-10% for balance, but that also means only being able to afford a few shares of the pricier plays that are over three figures. Haven’t seen much growth with this strategy, but I also don’t have a fortune to throw into stocks. So my investments are basically an alternative to letting money sit in a savings account. Figure if I start with 10k and it happens to finish the year at 11k that’s way better than the .01% interest the bank will give me. And if my picks lose, then hopefully losses aren’t too great by staying diverse."

Gains are gains and while I wouldn't be picking stocks unless you're regularly adding to index funds in a retirement account first, there's nothing wrong with DCAing into a stock instead of doing lump sum investing.

If you only have a few hundred to play with I don't see much point in spreading it around (find something you really love, the per hour return on watching a bunch of tickers ain't there), if you're putting a few hundred to a few thousand into each ticker I can see that making sense."

03/22/2021,stocks,"My lower limit is $2,500. That’s the minimum I’ll put in a single stock.  That makes me do more DD and research. If I had a few hundred bucks in one I wouldn’t really care about tracking it honestly."
03/22/2021,stocks,"> is there value in only buying a few shares of the average performing stock? Or do I need to up my percentage? 

This is apples and oranges. One can buy 1 share of Costco and that’s 100% of their portfolio.....are you asking if micro positions are worth it? Where one company makes up like 0.5% of your portfolio? 

This ain’t financial advice but IMHO It isn’t worth it in the long term. Say you have a $100k invested, one stock you only have $500 in, it doubles, congrats, you have $100,500. It’s not meaningful. 

It all comes down to risk and reward. Less companies you have, more risk you incur but the more reward you can have as a result. More diversified, less risky, but less reward. 

Just be mindful, you can be over diversified."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I'm not going to sit here and act like I know what I'm talking about but I have about 20k invested in 27 companies, 3 being SPACs and 2 sort of bullshit penny stocks. So 22 companies to actually keep track of. 

If you're buying and holding and not thinking about selling day-to-day it's not like you have to spend a lot more time on it. I spend a few hours doing DD before I buy, then look at the earnings quarterly, read the news on them once a month (more often for big positions or when there's big news that jumps into a general feed), and otherwise don't do a whole lot. 

Personally for big-ish companies I treat $500 as kind of a floor entry point so I feel like I have skin in the game, less for my 2 penny stocks. But that's arbitrary, I just feel like I won't do the DD and keep track of it if I invest less. 

If you're planning on buying the stocks you're talking about and then selling at the relatively modest price targets you're talking about then it seems sort of pointless to buy a couple shares. But if it's a stock you'd like to buy and hold for a while and maybe add to the position over time a little bit then it makes sense to me. It's all personal preference though."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Sounds like you could benefit from dividend paying stocks as well. And it doesn't matter how many shares you have in each company necessarily, it's your strategy and portfolio gain. 5-10% growth in your portfolio is pretty solid for long term investing. Diversification= less risk, less reward. Aggressive investing in a select few stocks = high risk, high reward."
03/22/2021,stocks,If you have 40k to invest you should really consider buying stocks in multiples of 100 and selling covered calls. You can sell OTM and keep your shares while pocketing the premium.
03/22/2021,stocks,Good response and it’s kinda the answer I figured. Thank you.
03/22/2021,stocks,good point. Even if it’s over 5 years that 40k could turn into 42k which to your point is certainly better than nothing
03/22/2021,stocks,"I think this is a good mentality. To your point on this strategy im not sure we’ll see lot of growth, but it’s better than it sitting in the bank.

I’ve think I’m starting to learn that I’d like to tweak my strategy and have larger %’s in fewer companies. It’s been a learning game."
03/22/2021,stocks,"But even if you understand the company’s value you still might only believe it’s has a little room to grow, but nonetheless thats better than nothing."
03/22/2021,stocks,"True. Even though I hold long term I still spend too much time watching the ticker. And to your point, for a stock where I only have 1-2 shares that’s not worth my time. However if I had 10k in the share maybe it’s a different story."
03/22/2021,stocks,"My question wasn’t necessarily about one micro position but many micro positions. So to your point that might be over diversifying. 

Good point on the stock that doubles. Profit is profit, but it’s ultimately meaningless in comparison to the larger portfolio."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I too like to live anxiously.

Jokes aside $500 is a pretty typical initial trade for me, but I won't buy a company unless I'm planning to ultimately invest at least $1000 and probably more like $2000-2500 now as my liquidity has improved. That's the point where a 10-20% gain (realistic over a 1yr window without going super risky) becomes a meaningful gain and a doubling (my optimistic target over a 3-5yr window) becomes a major gain."
03/22/2021,stocks,"> Good point on the stock that doubles. Profit is profit, but it’s ultimately meaningless in comparison to the larger portfolio.

Yerp. In my $100k example. That $500 in profit would be smaller than some daily market fluctuations. And it’s true for any portfolio."

Hitachi has been concentrating on IT services for the last while, and especially focusing on smart grid technology and railways, most of their revenue still comes from Japan but they're fairly active in Europe as well- moving more into the US is the next obvious step.

There will be massive waste and fraud with lots of contracts handed out to sketchy companies that should not be trusted to build anything.  I think the way to make money from this might be to search for small, regional companies that have had a rough go over the last few years with financials that can be markedly juiced be securing contracts.  Basically you want companies with stock that has been beaten down because they really are not very good businesses but will look like gold when a huge load of tax payer money is dropped on them.  

At least this would be my approach for speculation."

They were already solid, so it's a good play (or was, might be late now) but sure it aint going to stoke fantasies of overnight riches.

03/22/2021,stocks,If you’re asking about holding based on hype you should probably sell
03/22/2021,stocks,Where your argument falls down is the assumption she needs Tesla share price to increase to make money she's already made 20x her cash. If she genuinely thought Tesla had reached its ceiling she could sell and put that capital into something else.
03/22/2021,stocks,"If you do sell, pleases give us an update in 2025 on how that went for you"
03/22/2021,stocks,I like Tesla long term. I am holding.
03/22/2021,stocks,"If she didn’t have conviction in Tesla, she’d tout another company. Ark’s invested in dozens of companies. She could go out and pump any of them. She really believes in Tesla. You can question the accuracy of her prediction, but questioning her sincerity seems pointless. 

Judge a person by their actions, not by their words. Her actions prove the sincerity of her conviction."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Don’t be lazy and do your own valuation of Tesla instead of either believing or scoffing at ARK’s. If your valuation is higher than current stock price, sell, and if it is lower, hold. Here’s mine:

Bear case: $615 in 2025 based on $12 billion profits on $133 billion revenue.

Base case: $1,540 in 2025 based on $30 billion profits on $245 billion revenue"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Let's check with the people that thought the same thing last year; that it was time to sell Tesla last year and that Cathie Wood's prediction from a year ago was insane. How did that work out for them and do they regret selling?

I believe in Tesla for the long-term and I'm going to continue to hold for a long time."
03/22/2021,stocks,"All I know is buy low, sell high.  Doesn't get much higher than 1000x earnings"
03/22/2021,stocks,"You think one analyst can singlehandedly control the price of Tesla? This isn’t a pump and dump penny stock, it’s a company in the S&P500.  The research is posted online, go look at it and if you don’t agree with ARK’s assumptions you can value it based on your own model.  I bought more in the recent dip."
03/22/2021,stocks,"
>In my opinion, her prediction is an attempt to keep the hype alive, but the hype is dying. She wants Ark’s investments in Tesla to pay off....

Why wouldn't she just sell if she didn't believe?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I never invested in Tesla for the hype, if I did I would have sold through all the peaks in 2020. (Cost basis: around 200$ presplit) I don't follow the short term noise nor do I try to project any negativity onto a firm like ARK that has consistently called the forest from the trees forming in the future.

From my perspective of this company, they are still executing and the only company really delivering sustainable innovation with a scalable strategy that has proven it's success.

That being said, I am holding and not selling and reassessing in 2023.

In the meantime I am on a share accumulation strategy and buying up any dip I can.

2500 shares going strong."
03/22/2021,stocks,Let’s just say it’s not undervalued like Apple was in 2000’s
03/22/2021,stocks,"Growth is only beginning for Tesla, imo. But I understand how recent run-up makes certain people uncomfortable. However, decisions should not be made based on emotions. Look up MeetKevin's recent videos on TSLA. They have pretty good projections for the company going forward. It's too conservative, imo, but it still might give you 8.5x over the next 10 years. I think it will perform better, but you never know"
03/22/2021,stocks,"What does an analyst's view have to do with business fundamentals? Why didn't you sell when Gordon Johnson set a price target of $40? 

What if I came out with a price target of $10,000 by EOY - would you sell then? C'mon man, use your head. Just because someone said it will go up or down shouldn't impact your thesis so much on a company - that you are wanting to sell a company - just because an analyst is pumping it for hype (even if it was the case, which I don't think it is)."
03/22/2021,stocks,I”ll be buying more at $666 AH
03/22/2021,stocks,"I've never been a big fan of TSLA due to the fact I don't follow it closely enough to decide and trying to avoid some volatility, but I saw a post here this week-end that may change my mind.  It was posted by someone who has owned apple for 15 years I believe and what the co. was when he bought it is so far from what it is today due to their brand and their technology.  I can see the same for Tesla, if you believe that what they are today will be hugely different than what they will be in 10+ years the shares may be very cheap.  If so you can't look at their EPS or PE etc. The technologies they've developed so far have changed so many things forever so far.  Musk is a genius (no common sense sometimes)but a genius, and with genius, there is no way to foresee 10 years away and for $15k for 20 shares (or whatever you can tie up) it may be worth a shot to buy and hold for 10 years.  Thoughts?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Doesn't need to wait till TSLA get to $3000 to regret, but this person will regret when the stock get back to $850"
03/22/2021,stocks,"It's a great question, and literally no one knows the answer, including Cathie."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I’m holding, not selling anything and would buy more if it wasn’t already like 1/3 of my portfolio."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Now it is the worst time to sell because right now it is peak FUDs with “muh competition is coming” and first quarter is usually the slowest. If TSLA can hold $650-700 now imagine what value it would be when we get good news about factories, model 2, cyber trucks, mega pack mass adoption etc. It’s easy for companies to come out and say we’re gonna make this many EVs and then inflate their number by selling to dealership. We have not seen any proof of their ability to execute their plan. There have been ZERO innovations from big autos."
03/22/2021,stocks,She was right years ago about Tesla’s price now.....
03/22/2021,stocks,We bought because we have expectations that Tesla will own the world. Now you want to sell before the party starts?
03/22/2021,stocks,"Idk why longs would still hold when it hit nearly 1000 earlier. Hindsight is 2020 but the buy low sell high seems like in all regards that it would be wise to sell now. Also no hedge fund manager is going to bearish, that said I think Cathy woods is a hype master and is pretty successful at pumping up stocks that her funds buy. Im super skeptical of both her and Tsla."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Should *you* sell Tesla. Yes, the key word being *you.* You obviously have a weak thesis for investing in the stock in the first place if the reason you want to sell is because you think her fund is trying to ""keep the hype alive"".

Not saying this to be mean. You need to invest in a stock that you have conviction in based off of solid evidence/information. You'll feel much better during its' ebbs and flows."
03/22/2021,stocks,"How much you got? 

Hold"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Tesla have a great growth, but as much as I value tesla the company, the stock have 6.93 peg ratio and more than a thousand (!) P/e ratio, I can't see a way when tesla have justification for it's value in the next 10 or 15 years with any competition, so I am not a financial advisor but sell your ass of this stoxk"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yes, sell i need more"
03/22/2021,stocks,"All of the big Tesla bull cases I see are predicated on products/services from Tesla which don't exist yet, but are in the 'pipeline', and history tells me that Tesla aren't great at delivering on time or even at all.  
  
The large automakers are now starting to really roll out EVs and they are outselling Tesla in Europe already. VW are only going to bring out more EVs, so are Ford, Daimler, BMW, JLR, GM, Stellantis etc etc. Tesla are going to find their moat as a car company will dry up as time goes on, there are too many basics they still haven't got right and likely won't in time to stop the VW tide."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Tesla is a stock that you don't ever want to sell. 

Just my opinion."
03/22/2021,stocks,You're accusing Cathie of being dishonest and trying to pump the stock. Not cool man. You should sell since you don't seem to understand the company or why she put the price target on it that she did.
03/22/2021,stocks,"If you think the run on Tesla is over, then you should really examine the entire market. Even the most conservative companies are way over typical P/E's, and every analyst and money manager out there is predicting a continued bull market. All signs point to a bubble, but the market keeps going up anyways. You need to examine your own risk tolerance and decide how comfortable you are in this market. 

With my money though, AAPL and TSLA are the future, even if we see a correction they will be major players in the long term. 

Not investment advice."
03/22/2021,stocks,Yes and buy when it inevitably corrects
03/22/2021,stocks,Remember EVs are no where near the norm yet. They won't become mainstream for another 5 years or so.
03/22/2021,stocks,Even if Tesla hits the $1000+ it was at one point before the split I’ll be ok with it
03/22/2021,stocks,lol she does though. These companies have people who’s sole purpose is to look into these things. Also being connected helps finding info few people know about. She might be wrong but trust she has more info on Tesla than your average Joe.

03/22/2021,stocks,"I don't see where Tesla can increase sales enough to justify its PE, and margins are going to continually shrink as more competition comes online, which further decreases earnings."
03/22/2021,stocks,Good luck betting against Elon.
03/22/2021,stocks,"She wants Ark’s investments in Tesla to payoff? 

Do you realize she’s up up more than 10x on her Tesla position?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yea, sell your Tesla and buy GME. Meanwhile I'll hold my TSLA."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I hit my 1 year cap gains and sold Tesla immediately - I appreciate Cathie pumping it for today lmao. 

I loved it at last year's valuation, but the current one and future projection is way too rich for my blood. I have more than enough exposure to Tesla through my ETFs that I'm alright."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I gotta agree with you. Tesla is a long term winner but it’s up almost 2,000% from 2019 low. There’s gotta be another correction or two before we start running again"
03/22/2021,stocks,"The ""new price target is pretty much the same as the old one. The old price target pre split for if Tesla solved FSD was between $15000 and $22000. That's equivalent to $3000 and $4400 post split. Her new price target is $3000 to $4000 if tesla solves fsd and makes robotaxis. The price targets are about the same as before but now all of a sudden shes just trying to hype Tesla? If you think the company is going to stop growing from here then sell but I've watched 10+hours of FSD beta vids on youtube on each update and based on the progress since the beta was released at the end of October(less than 6 months ago)  this will likely have progressed enough by the end of 2022 to start seeing approval in some cities."
03/22/2021,stocks,$3000/share would value TSLA at 14% of US GDP. And 35% More valuable than AAPL. Maybe hyperinflation gets us there 🤷‍♂️
03/22/2021,stocks,"Tesla is more than just cars. They are working to make the Texas electric grid solar now. The tesla roof and storage for individual houses is going to be huge.

03/22/2021,stocks,"I’ve been short Tesla for a while now, Cathies Tesla prediction just primed me to increase my position."
03/22/2021,stocks,I would prefer if people who don't bother to look at Ark's research and assumptions (it's all online) would just sell Tesla instead of spreading FUD.

03/22/2021,stocks,TSLA is about to get their market share sapped at every price point by VW/Kia/Hyundai/Ford/Porsche. It's wildly overpriced.
03/22/2021,stocks,Id rather have volatile Tesla stocks than FIAT USD. Should of bought more shares after he smoked a Blunt. price was 150$ a share and that was years before the split. Money printer goes BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
03/22/2021,stocks,"I am long on Tesla for a lot of reasons besides the EV's and IMO that's why the stock is trading where it is and the reason why a number of analysts are still bullish on it. Tesla's stock price is completely reliant on Musk and his other ventures and any success in SpaceX, The Boring company, solar city, Hyperloop, etc, etc should have a positive impact on Tesla. For instance, just watch how the stock jumped when SpaceX delivered astronauts to the ISS in May last year."
03/22/2021,stocks,Time will tell if they can thrive with the level of competition about to hit.  The new Ford Mustang already took a heavy bit of market share and that is just the beginning.
03/22/2021,stocks,A CEO that calls himself Technoking and a CFO that goes by “the master of coin” does not spark confidence in said company. This is not a company that takes anything seriously. I take my money very seriously and I expect the leaders of companies I buy in to to take my money seriously as well.
03/22/2021,stocks,"The price should have nothing to do with your long term investing strategy. If you beljeve in the company and got it at a fair price, hold. Otherwise sell."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yes please, I welcome anyone on the fence to sell them so I can buy more for less. Just my very personal opinion is that I'm yet to see a better discount on any stock that's this much of a long-term no-brainer. You can look at current earnings all you want, the way I like to look at it is that it's at the very least the new Apple of cars that's still a fraction of Apple's cap, and Steve Jobs is still at its helm, except Elon is arguably a much bigger deal than Jobs ever was."
03/22/2021,stocks,Stocks always dip but TSLA is constantly innivating. Eg. starlight later this year is going to be amazing for rural aussies and anyone who wants to go camping
03/22/2021,stocks,"I think she plans to hold. But to here her say it’s going that high, seems like a hype build, which gets others in to buying. On every side of a buyer is a seller, which makes me think there is some selling in her game..."

03/22/2021,stocks,"I've been ""throwing money away"" with Tesla for the last decade since I'm a huge Elon fan (I firmly believe that you invest in the people you believe in). With that said, I don't have an answer for you other than as a pot-head, I wish Cathie would pass me whatever it is she is smoking."

And they ran a Monte Carlo simulation to workout the likelihood of each of these crazy scenarios!?! ARK will turn out to be the mother of all shorts."

03/22/2021,stocks,"My take is that a company isn't going to trade at 1000x earnings forever.  I don't know of any that have sustained that kind of multiplier.  Even if they perform and grow, an adjustment in p/e would still result in the stock lower in price."

03/22/2021,stocks,"If cathie wood tried to sell Tesla it would dump so fast and hedge funds would front run the downfall. She’s a prisoner to this position, it’s the majority reason for ARKK growth in 2020"

And I wanted to add: you really want to bet against Elon?"
03/22/2021,stocks,I am also holding.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I like it too, but their market cap doesn't reflect their earnings. Just like dot com companies had a market cap unaligned with their earnings. Tesla can and will definitely grow to be a big market cap, and they may never crash like dot com did for a number of reasons, particularly they don't have a bunch of competitors to expose how stupid their market cap is and an electric vehicle company is a very difficult thing to make as well as Tesla has. So I think in 10-20 years Tesla market cap will likely stay the same or go down because there's no way Tesla will reasonably have a legitimate market cap that's significantly larger than the world's largest automotive manufacturers combined. They're already above most other manufacturers combined, and if they stay here for 10-20 years that will be absolutely a win for them because it means they have become the largest & most profitable automotive manufacturer in the world."

Only time will tell I guess...
03/22/2021,stocks,"The only problem is that none of the EVs are as good as the Tesla models.  Also, Tesla sells every car they can produce so saying they are getting outsold in Europe (Gordon, is that you?) is moot.

4680 will be a game changer.  FSD is already better than anything else available.  The Cybertruck really has no competition once released."
03/22/2021,stocks,The market only cares about the general sentiment regarding whether or not Elon can come up with services that people will want to pay money for. That’s one of the things I’m betting on w my longs as well.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Please correct me if I am wrong here and explain to me why? I feel P/E is just a useless matrix. It depends on Price and Profits.

Profits are heavily dependent on money I invest elsewhere. If I stop investing that money and just take profit my P/E would drop considerably but that would actually be a bad move.

03/22/2021,stocks,The problem i see with ARK is that they own a to high % in very tech heavy companies which is great when things are going up.but If things start to go bad can you imagine trying to exit a position in a company If you own 5-20% of it. And the tech aector usually trade togheter up and down
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yes, that's it. If she suddenly went bearish on Tesla, it would call into question her whole analysis of the company so far. For better or worse, she and her reputation are married to Tesla."

03/22/2021,stocks,I’m not a DD provider or financial advisor I litterally told you my thoughts grow up child
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yes she could be,  but there has to be common sense, I'll use your numbers to give my thoughts. 

1. They made lead autonomous,  but it's not guaranteed.  It's also not guaranteed they will be the only autonomous.  Just because the technology is new, doesn't mean it will result in massive sales or dollars. They will have competition. Just as anything else,  you can't expect every autonomous taxi to be a tesla. 

2. They can enter the battery market just as generac has.  Again,  competition.  Generac has a great battery system,  a much more built out network for sales,  distribution,  and installation.  They also have more option sizes offered for the customer. Generac is a 20b company who has been the leader in backup generators for years.  Batteries may replace the standard gas and propane units,  but figure that entire market is not likely to increase 100x because they are batteries.  They may tap into consumers who didn't already have gas as a fuel source,  but the expense will also limit the market for a time period.  When expenses come down there will be more competition. 

3. Building additional factories can ramp up production,  but let's look at the leader in the world at auto sales Toyota.. they have a 200b cap selling 9 million units.  There many automakers getting into this space.  It's highly unlikely tsla will ever sell more autonomous cars in a year than Toyota sells with ice engines right now.  Also remember,  just because it's autonomous won't necessarily translate to higher revenue. 

I'm not bashing tesla. Great company.  I just pump the brakes at the hype and valuation.  Certainly at today's price. Not willing to pay for all of the above before it happens and executes. I think too much of it is priced to perfection in the stock from my investor cap."
03/22/2021,stocks,"> 2) Tesla will enter the energy market with their battery's. Green energy storage is currently a huge issue.

I'm not sure how many people are aware of this, but the Lithium Ion battery chemistry used by Tesla (and all EVs) is optimized for energy density and lightweight at the cost of...cost.

If your goal is to store large amounts of energy and you don't really care about weight or energy density there are far better technologies than Lithium Ion. Tesla has a first mover advantage in this space at the moment but there is no way it will last unless they start using a different technology for their storage systems."
03/22/2021,stocks,All of this was priced into its ballooning price post-split. TSLA priced in so much growth in 2020 that it really takes a break from logic to believe the price could continue to increase exponentially by pricing in all the same catalysts over the next 10 years.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yes,  but for them to grow into the multiple,  that means the earnings are increasing faster than the share price which is exactly my point.  Just because they start bringing in more revenue does not necessarily mean an increase in stock price. Maybe it doesn't go down,  but who the hell wants the price to be the same when the company doubles revenue. What it means is that you're paying a huge premium for what has yet to happen."
03/22/2021,stocks,And Tesla's revenue is substantially growing YoY
03/22/2021,stocks,Wow it looks like the highest P/E ratio for amazon was around 3000 in around 2010?
03/22/2021,stocks,"It lost like 95% of its value in the dot com crash and took 15 years to get back to where it was.

That’s a best case for Tesla"
03/22/2021,stocks,Revolutionizing retail is a big deal vs building cars.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I may be misunderstanding you, but the E in P/E refers to earnings (profits) of the company, not your personal return on the stock. There is no ""your P/E"". If Tesla is trading at 1000x earnings, we might say as a mature company they should be trading at a P/E of 100 (just an arbitrary number), or around the P/E of a tech leader like Amazon for example.

So for them to go from 1000 P/E to 100 P/E their earnings have to grow to ten times their current, along with their stock price (the P part) not moving up at all. Or the stock can go up 25% a year, and their earnings up 50% a year, but it will take more time for the earnings to catch up to price to make a 100 P/E. I don't know what the fair P/E price is for the company, but a 1000 P/E is not sustainable over time as the company matures."
03/22/2021,stocks,"> I feel P/E is just a useless matrix. It depends on Price and Profits.

P/E is a quick and dirty way to value a company. What is ""good"" for one might not be for another, but there are generalizations based on past experience that allow people to ballpark a P/E value that is considered healthy for any company. In this case, a P/E in the thousands can generally be agreed as something that is not healthy."

03/22/2021,stocks," And no one answer with growth bullshit, 6.9 peg"
03/22/2021,stocks,"The ridiculous part of of this is you still need 6-7 years to get into “reasonable” P/E sub 20.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Mathematically, that is true. But practically speaking, it is more complicated. If ARKK's position in Tesla went to 0, the fund would lose 10% of value, but Cathie Wood's credibility would take a much bigger hit. Considering how much conviction she has around that single stock, some of her shareholders would no doubt question her ability and start to bail on the fund. This is all conjecture, as the odds of Tesla going to zero are very small, but in a high-stakes momentum game with shareholders having high expectations, reputation is very important."
03/22/2021,stocks,Because perception and reality don't always follow eachother. ARK funds do not match their holdings perfectly- much of their value is ties to the future themselves now rather than simply the holdings.
03/22/2021,stocks,There’s not one “ARK”.  These are ETF’s each focused on a particular sector.  So the tech ARKK and ARKQ will hold a lot of TSLA by the very nature of those stock funds.  As will other focus funds.
03/22/2021,stocks,That tweet was a nod to splitting the stock - not Elon expressing concern about $TSLA valuation.
03/22/2021,stocks,"No, there is not a good probability of that.

Battery storage will be ~300X current sales and much of that capacity will be grid scale and tied to Autobidder.

20MM vehicles sold, including the '25k' car, Cybertruck, and Semi.

No one else has the battery capacity, either now or planned. VW's talking about 6 factories totaling 240GWh by 2030. Tesla's Giga Berlin is opening at 100 and will be scaling to 250GWh within a few years. By the time Berlin is done scaling we'll likely see EU factory #2.

No one has the same core efficiency of being able to go far on the same amount of kwh in a comparable vehicle. See Tesla kwh of 3's and Y's vs MachE's, VW's ID's.

And I don't need to argue about it. (Not to say you've been argumentative, but some people get outright mean when I lay it out). People will either see it, or get run over by it.

I did not want to write this.

1. Elon Musk apparently has build some tunnels under Las Vegas creating a hub to transport people. These tunnels are perfect for autonomous driving Tesla's. His autonomous driving cars are not yet advanced enough to work above ground in area's heavy populated like Las Vegas. And while he is close it will take some time to perfect this. I'm not sure any company in the world is withtin 2 years of perfecting autonomous driving above ground in heavy populated area's with lots of random factors. Even with LIDAR it won't work according to people like George Hotz. In any case, Musk is working around his issue by creating this tunnel network. He could get some aproval in one state for fully autonomous driving and it might take longer in another. World wide I don't know. Europe might be hard due to extensive safety legislations.

2. Look at the demand in Europe for solutions to store energy. They have days where they just turn off windmill parks because they produce more energy than that there is demand for. EU countries subsidises solar panels trough tax reforms. They are looking for incredible storage solutions. This market has not even begun to develop. When the US will start to have the same ""issues"" it will explode but is is al depending on if Biden gets his bills passed and how fast tech development in this area is moving forward.

3. I don't think Tesla and Toyota are even competing. Tesla is after a different kind of customer with a lot more money to spend. They can make so much on deals like battery replacement/maintenance, future software upgrade packages. They can actually strip autonomous driving in categories. Not autonomous, Semi, Full. You can always upgrade at any time as the hardware is already there. Legislation in europe will make it really hard to sell convential cars. Countries and certain cities are already banning convential cars/trucks unles it's fully EV/hydrogen based."

Based on VWs aggressive timeline of going all EV in five years, this tells us is that they are making a lot more batteries than they'll know what to deal with.  It's a good problem to have and could allow them to spin-off and pivot a tier-one supplier company.

I think efficiency will hopefully drive the entire sector forward.  Instead of dealing with ICE cars that get anywhere from 250 to 400 miles per tank, we ultimately start seeing EV getting 600 miles per charge.  Essentially, mitigating range anxiety becomes a way to allow for more spacing between charging stations and the petrol-like network that will pop up/convert along with it."

Tesla might be the one winning the race in all of those fields but a new competitor could just eclipse them by 2030. It is still a gamble, personally it isn't a long term buy for me even at a 700b market cap. But who know, I don't have a bearish position either just feel like this is just powered by hype"

They have lots of visions,  and I don't think those visions should exceed the market cap of multiple industry leaders combined. Those visions have yet to give me realistic market numbers,  execution plans,  and revenue expectations.  Example-Generac 20b cap as the leading backup power. Am I supposed to believe that battery backup will now be hundreds of billions because it's simply new and different? Newer ideas always talk about the size of the industry potential,  but then the execution has to happen.  Look at 3D printing.  Talk about huge manufacturing and inventory disruption with computer files and printing parts on demand opposed to a specialized machine and having to inventory the production.  The potential is enormous,  but the leaders in the industry for years have underwhelmed results and the most valuable of their company's is a few billion."

If earnings always = 0, eventually the company either goes bankrupt with debt, or shareholders start to re-evaluate the company's worth and sell the stock.

I do agree that with growth stocks, there is the expectation that the company will operate for some time without profit. It's very unusual for a company with a market cap the size of Tesla's to have not produced meaningful earnings (which currently are coming from subsidies)."

> I don’t get this... why does the financials of a company need to correlate with the price of the stock?


You're so close to realizing what the problem is with Tesla. 

Stock prices in an ideal world will be correlated with earnings and other fundamentals within certain parameters. It's practically baked into the maths. EPS, for example, is literally the total earnings divided by the total number of shares in a company, and the P/E is a formula to tell you if something is over or under priced.

Rather than asking why Tesla's doesn't correlate, however, you are asking why it should matter, which is why people are not taking you seriously."
03/22/2021,stocks,In that case yes they do correlate
03/22/2021,stocks,But it won’t be a huge growth company at that time...it’d be one of the largest revenue generators on the planet by then.  Eventually it has to turn into an Apple where your “product” reaches saturation and your return cash to shareholders while maintaining your market share.
03/22/2021,stocks,"It's not. It's supposed to be, but it isn't."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I'm highly doubtful retail investors are driving up Tesla's valuation, institutions are.  If anything these idiots have made a lot of money as of now(I don't own any shares of Tesla)"

03/22/2021,stocks,"Stock offerings are not always made out of a concern for valuation. In fact, most stock offerings are made to raise money, eliminate debt, take advantage of investor interest and momentum."

MachE and ID4 vs Model Y.

You'll find Tesla is actually better positioned than just about any of them in that ratio department.

You should also then compare how well eTron and Taycan sell compared to their Tesla counterparts. Or how far they can go. Or where and how fast you can charge them."
03/22/2021,stocks,Still no decent charging infrastructure by other manufacturers after all these years. And they seem stingy about using Tesla’s superchargers even though Tesla is open to allowing it. Biggest reason imo that many will not even look at other cars
03/22/2021,stocks,Data.
03/22/2021,stocks,It doesn’t. To say that other automakers will make tesla another run of the mill car company isn’t taking into account the full picture though.
03/22/2021,stocks,I understand finance might make you emotional but there is no need to hurl insults. I was simply pointing out the fact that they are not just a car company.. that’s a simple fact.
03/22/2021,stocks,"OK. Feel free to set a 'remind me' and come back and look. If 20MM by 2030 is the target I'm good with ~10% either way in terms of time or units. As in, 'oh no, they only hit 18MM by 2030' or 'alas, it took until 2032 to hit 20MM', I'm still counting that as a win."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Step right up and place your bets. ;)

Tesla is still installing charging at +30% YoY. And making vehicles that go further per charge. And lowering the cost of said vehicles. 

In ~2-3 years expect Berlin and Austin both to be in the ~2MM/year range. Shanghai in the ~1MM range. And that construction will already be started or complete (phase 1) of another North American, EU, AND (not 'or')Chinese/Indian Gigafactory. And each of those will eventually grow to the same ~2MM/year range. 

Quick poll - who actually watched the battery day presentation?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"It's also maths.

Industry players like VW, GM, and Toyota do around 9MM units a year.  They do an order of magnitude less.  Know who sells more than them?  Fucking Geely at 1.3MM units.  This being a manufacturer that will be ready to enter the US market ""in the next five years"" for the past 20 years.

It also remains to be seen how their used values hold up.  People are keeping their vehicles longer and longer every year -- average age of a car on the road in the US is somewhere around 11 years.  Considering that we don't really have many data points that are fully modeled by the existing market and ""seasoning"", and replacement of the batteries will cost around the price of a brand-new compact car (USD$15,000) it remains to be seen how this affects the demand of new vehicle sales."
03/22/2021,stocks,You would value using a dcf
03/22/2021,stocks,You seriously think an electric vehicle that doesn't spit out used fossil fuels won't affect the daily lives? How about climate change? That big enough to affect the daily life?
03/22/2021,stocks,"Buying things at home really is minor compared to what the grand scheme of revolutionizing the common car. This is like saying Amazon is like all of the other .Com companies. Currently maybe, 20 years tesla will be the name like Amazon."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Right, but why do they need to correlate? That is what doesn’t make sense to me"
03/22/2021,stocks,"But the problem is with so many stocks...

Tesla makes zero sense to me.. p/e is through the roof. They did a stock split and the price just continued to rise. 

People aren’t taking me seriously, but fundamentally the stock market just doesn’t make sense when so many companies are overvalued/undervalued based on their actual earning. Tesla gets pumped while other companies are shorted to the ground."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yeah but that won’t happen til 2030 or beyond. It’ll still be a huge growth company for a while now. Especially if you believe FSD will work out. Also, even Apple has a PE of 33.

Not saying Tesla isn’t overvalued at its current state, but expecting a PE ratio of 20 is laughable"

03/22/2021,stocks,"Yeah these idiots bought tesla at 150$ right after he smoked a blunt with joe Rogan and price fell off a cliff. Then price went to 2000$ and had 6 to 1 stock split and now its up at 686$. These idiots made a lot of money as of now, you are correct."
03/22/2021,stocks,No one sells something worth $10.00 for $1.00. Best case scenerio is Musk thought the price was fair value around $450 when he did a big offering. Worst case is he thought it was grossly overvalued. There is no case where he thought it was undervalued and decided to sell below its real value.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Do you realize they have made all of these cars as a side project because they are still making billions selling gasoline engine cars?

The only thing holding them back is that they have to CONVERT production to electric and why do that when you are still making money?

Tesla just jump started the industrial change, but they started from scratch so of course they are ahead. 

The ford Model T was THE car when it came out, and then look at what the Japanese and Germans did to the auto industry, they literally took over. Toyota is seconded by Volkswagen atm. 

They are still developing gasoline cars so it's like they are currently playing basketball with one hand tied to their backs. 

Who cares about core efficiency? Do you think the average person currently understand anything about the efficiency of gasoline engines?

The price of the car/ the price to operate it and the overall look of the car is way more important to most people then the tech inside the car.

And quite frankly I don't care about investing or anything regarding this atm. If you make money good for you. The casino is full of weirdos and crazy people too you know."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I already explained this. The other manufacturers are doing this as a side project and in a few years they have achieved what took Tesla a decade.

Once they fully convert to manufacturing EV's then they will slowly build the infrastructure with it.

Would it have made sense for Tesla to build a massive EV charging infrastructure when they were only selling a few hundred or a few thousand cars? It would cost more than the money they had...."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I still think that Tesla will continue to have somewhat of a competitive edge over other automakers, but I don't believe that that slight MOAT justifies such a high valuation for selling such a low amount of cars comparative to how many cars are sold each year, even as time goes on"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Okay, so Mitsubishi isn't another un of the mill car company as well. They are in: Mining, shipbuilding, telecom, financial services, insurance, electronics, automotive, construction, heavy industries, oil and gas, real estate, foods and beverages, chemicals, steel, aviation and others

What does tesla do other than sell a very small amount of cars and bail out elons brother's solar company? Like currently in 2021... because a promise from tesla is worth as much as a fart in the wind."
03/22/2021,stocks,"It actually is taking into account the full picture....Tesla does not exist by itself, and if their other areas of business was forecast to be more successful I imagine they would have started their to easily fund the cars?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Nah, you said that in the context that is why they are worth as much as they are which is bs. And what you said was not a fact, they are not a battery company because they don't make and sell any batteries. I wasn't insulting, that was a simple fact. You are by the very definition of the word ""delusional"""
03/22/2021,stocks,"That's kind of my point.  Tesla, barring some huge unforeseen calamity that affects every other manufacturer, won't sell 20MM/year by 2030.  They will have the *capacity* to do so, absolutely, but their batteries will be in the chassis of other manufacturers.  And *that* is where they will make their money in the future.  Attempting to capture 20% of the global new car market is a pipe dream that every OEM plans for but in reality, no ever actually hits.

At this point, it's really about what is a reasonable projection.  While they are growing YoY, that's mostly due to the small volumes they produce today.  GM, Toyota, VWAG pump out ~9MM units a year and Tesla struggles to crack an order of magnitude *less* than that.  They'll likely settle just above the ranks of ""luxury"" makes like BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus; around 4MM units.  That is, if Musk doesn't get bored and move on to new projects by then."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Like I just said elsewhere, battery production does not equal vehicle production.  That you can't divorce these two things tells me you have little to no idea about the automotive sector nor the concept of ""nuance"".

We're done here, have a good one."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Sure it effects daily life in that sense.  But you don't buy a new car every day.  You're completely assuming that tesla is going to be the only company selling electric vehicles.  Ford revolutionized the auto industry,  are all the cars Ford?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Tesla and amazon arent comparable, Amazon literally changed the whole e-commerce market and made it so convenient for consumers to solely buy from amazon (like my family), Tesla hasnt got the gun at your head to buy their stuff, competition is always gonna follow and alot would catch up to Tesla some may even overtake (pun intended)"
03/22/2021,stocks,"They may revolutionize it,  but they aren't going to monopolize it.  If you think that 9/10 cars will be tsla,  that's just fooling yourself. Amazon has the market for online shopping and delivery.  Tesla may be the first to revolutionize,  but the other automakers will not be going away.  They will introduce their own innovations. Think of Ford with the mass produced model T. They revolutionized the automobile, but they are barely in the top 5 in units sold per year."
03/22/2021,stocks,Ok.  How do you know tesla will be the company to do that? Because they said so?
03/22/2021,stocks,That's backwards of a revolution.  People want change and go out and get it.  The vast majority of car owners don't give a shit about EV and are happy to drive ICE.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Because investors are buying a part of the future profits. If you buy at high fundamentals you have less share of those future profits. Companies with higher growth tend to have higher PEs as they have higher future profits relative to their price. Oftentimes these get overvalued during times of excitement and trade sideways or crash back to normal levels eventually. 

If their fundamentals become too high an investor is going to go to a different company that can return more profits to him or her. Growth is less important to investors than how much cash the company will eventually return to them."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Because that's what gives a stock its value. You own a part of the company so if the fundamentals are worse then what you own is worse and therefore worth less. 

There are obviously other factors that affect it like interest rates (lower rates favour growth companies which is partly why we are getting these crazy valuations), if interest rates ever seriously go up again there will be a crash. There is only so much growth that can be priced in. But even with that background the core is the actual fundamentals.

Sorry if this is a bit rambly I've never tried to explain the direct question of why and it got me thinking hahaha."
03/22/2021,stocks,"> But the problem is with so many stocks...

*Every* stock. Tesla is just the most obvious example.

> the stock market just doesn’t make sense when so many companies are overvalued/undervalued based on their actual earning. Tesla gets pumped while other companies are shorted to the ground.

You're right, it doesn't make sense, and it probably never will. We don't live in an ideal world, and stock price will *never* match the fundamentals. Rather than realizing this and using it to your advantage, you instead come across as using that as a reason to write off the fundamental maths."
03/22/2021,stocks,"You realize for TSLA to get to even a 50 P/E, its share price would have to decline 95% to \~35$ / share, right?"
03/22/2021,stocks,Current P/E market prices are so overblown right now a valuation of roughly 80 for a growth company the size of Tesla would be more than justified in context of the broader market. Not saying everything isnt overvalued. Just in context of market conditions that would make sense.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I’m not making the argument that Musk made a stock offering when he thought the stock was undervalued. 

Like I said, there are a myriad of reasons why a company would offer more stock - and it doesn’t always have to do with valuation. Perhaps Tesla just wanted some more cash to work with at the time, for who knows what reason? 

CEOs don’t sit around all day thinking about the stock price of their company, the moves they make and the press they generate are not always out of concern for the price of the company stock in the short-term."
03/22/2021,stocks,"You're making my case.

ICE OEM's don't have assets in those production lines. They're liabilities at this point. Tesla beats many of them in automotive margin. If they're willing to lower their margin and pass on savings to their customers they can. How much money do all the other major OEMs make on each of their competing cars? Doesn't Ford make the MachE in Mexico else lose a huge amount on each unit sold?

Who cares about efficiency? Did you never look at MPG when buying a car? Except it's so much more than that. If for example, Tesla can go 400 miles on 100kwh - that's a selling point. Someone else may want to go 400 miles but they have to install 110-130kwh. Now you've got a heavier car. You've also got a much more expensive car since no one else is close to Tesla's kwh/$$$. VW and others may be there in 2-3 years. But by that time Tesla will have cut their own prices by another 40-60%. So you made my point without thinking about it when you say ""The price of the car/ the price to operate it""."
03/22/2021,stocks,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA  


Quick, we've converted all of our lines and make ONLY EV's now... NOW let's start building the charging infrastructure. Yea right! It's a chicken and the egg scenario. Except you have to build both at the same time."
03/22/2021,stocks,I understand why you’re seeing it from that perspective. My perspective is EV’s have only just begun. And they are getting cheaper. Also with the gov’t giving a 7k tax credit for buying a tesla and more and more chargers being built all across the nation.. I think we’re at the tip of the iceberg. We’re getting close to setting a date to end production of gas powered cars. Could be massive.
03/22/2021,stocks,You’re clearly very passionate about this. So I’m not gonna argue with you. I respect your opinion. Good day to you bud.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I've considered the 'Tesla Inside' approach in the same way Intel did that with all the PC OEMs.

And Elon's said he and Tesla are open to it once they have more batteries than they have vehicles to put them in. But right now it seems like no one wants to buy, and Tesla has none to sell."
03/22/2021,stocks,"You're right. But VW's limited by batteries because vehicles are the only thing they put them in.

Tesla has this whole 'energy business' where they're killing it, and as posted elsewhere, will grow ~300X over the next 10 years."
03/22/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/22/2021,stocks,I choose not to buy Amazon because of the ethics behind their business and pollution. Not a gun to my head. EV is for a better planet and future Amazon is not. Pure convience. So you're right you can't compare either in that manor. But we are comparing revolutionized industries. They are both doing that.
03/22/2021,stocks,So would you say Tesla is the Ford of today? I would. I think Tesla will dominate for 50 years just like Ford did and then someone else will out innovate. Just like Amazon. Most companies live 100years. Ford is older than that so this is what you're seeing.
03/22/2021,stocks,"They have a massive head start on autonomous driving tech. No one else even comes close. The hype surrounding the company is also a massive selling point. Elon can and will get people to use his products, especially if they beat everyone else to market. It's not a guarantee, but the hype is very understandable. I think if Uber can justify a 100B market cap with no earnings at all, TSLA can easily justify its tag as well."
03/22/2021,stocks,"When an individual goes out and changes something let's say space like Pluto, or Galileo. Horse and buggy Henry Ford, light bubble Thomas Edison. You think all those people back then wanted change? Absolutely not they liked how things were going with the sun revolving around them, horses worked well, candles did just fine. This is revolution my friend. One human changing history and life as we know it."
03/22/2021,stocks,Until they get a greasy tax for driving a shitty polluting vehicle. Then ICE drivers might think twice when they get a tax credit for owning an EV. Money speaks even to the dumbest.
03/22/2021,stocks,"You realize that the PE ratio will go down significantly in coming years as Tesla becomes more profitable, right? It just looks super high cause they just recently became profitable. Growth stocks are forward looking.

Also, I just said it’s overvalued lol. I’m not gonna disagree there. But to say the most promising stock of our generation should have a PE sub 20...? In this market? Good luck with that."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yeah I am sure the difference between filling the battery for $8 vs $10-$12 would be a deal breaker. 

Yeah all those production lines that you think are now liabilities are useless since you know the car is just made up of an engine and no other parts right? 

All they have to do is revamp the engine manufacturing facilities the rest is good? 

And yeah if Tesla cuts costs and manages their GOAL of selling cars for $20-$25k I am sure that will be a highlight for investors as well"
03/22/2021,stocks,400 miles is 643.74 km
03/22/2021,stocks,"You do know that there are thousands of public charging stations all over the world in all countries, right? You don't need to build your own network of stations as VW. I know, because I have driven a hybrid Mercedes e class for quite a while and have used and charged at stations all over Europe."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Nah, because you can charge them at your house."
03/22/2021,stocks,Me thinks you have stayed in the basement for too long friend
03/22/2021,stocks,"But the reality is Tesla is at the tip of iceberg in market share for EV's. Just wait till every other car company catches up because as of now, they are still making way more money than Tesla peddling gasoline cars but when the time comes they will put forward full scale production and at that point goodbye Tesla market dominance.

Just look at the Porsche Taycan, the Audi E tron GT looks crazy as hell, the only downside the range being 400km but for Audi to make such a car in such a short time.... and the CEO of Toyota is very adamant that the world will see what can be done once they really enter the EV world aside from their hybrid/hydrogen cars.

NIO of china has the full ambition of the chinese CCP to be the worlds best EV, one of their cars already has a 1000km range plus they have stations where you can CHANGE your cars empty battery in 5 minutes and continue driving just like filling up gas. You can't do that with a Tesla and have an inconvenient charging wait time. Plus the interior of Tesla's scream boring, and if I don't think many people will want to trust their lives with self driving cars just yet. 

Apple has yet to announce their car and I am actually very curious to see what they will come up with. 

The Tesla fans have their heads up Elons ass so much they forget the company does not exist in a perfect vaccum all by itself"
03/22/2021,stocks,"EVs yeah. But EV doesn't equal Tesla only. Tesla had nearly zero competition until recently. Now I can't find an automaker that doesn't make EVs as part of their offering, and the number of options is going up. Toyota is also making their own solid state batteries, VW is investing 60billion euros in EVs, batteries and autonomous driving, etc. 

So I agree that EV is going to go way up. I don't see how that means Tesla is worth its value. By their own very aggrsibe estimates (50% growth year over year until 2025) they will sell 6.1M cars in total between now and then. That is still less then VW, Toyota, Renault-Nissan, GM, Hyundai group,  sell annually. It's a little more then Ford sells annually (so TSLA will sell as much in 5 years as ford in 13 months).

I know the market is forward looking but this is something else."
03/22/2021,stocks,Figures.  Stop spreading misinformation. Youre going to hurt people.
03/22/2021,stocks,i.e. you have absolutely nothing to say.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Amazon will generally hold the monopoly on the online shopping because of prime and their warehousing and delivery logistics.  Other companies are almost at the impossibility to catch up to take that market share any time soon.  Tesla has that monopoly in electric auto right now,  but that's doing peanuts in overall auto sales compared to the industry. By the time tesla would be able to produce and sell units to compete with the rest of the industry,  the other manufacturers will be selling them too"
03/22/2021,stocks,"A businesses end goal is to grow as much as possible right? So Amazon is a company that has grown so much and is in so many industries that they are making huge profits, they made their platform so diverse and easy to shop that its harder to avoid them. Tesla on the otherhand made an electric car while very innovative theres nothing stopping a competitor from just doing the same, Tesla is ahead now but these companies have barely made a few working consumer products let alone a product line. Once these companies change to all electric and have a decent amount of range and as practical as before or better than Tesla would just be another car company unless they get into licensing their software or robo taxis but looking at uber even that is hard to maintain"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I say yes,  but it's different times in technology.  They won't be 50 years ahead because other companies already have the manufacturing capabilities.  They just need to find the way to apply the technology that works best for them."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I understand the hype,  I just don't feel that it's investable. I honestly don't see them ever being worth trillions once the hype passes and they trade strictly on how their sales perform"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I didn't claim sub 20; I'd say 100-150 PE would be pretty fair, optimistic, and forward looking for tesla, or an 85 - 90% drop to $66 - $90 per share.

When you compare it to ENPH, the only stock in the SP500 to beat TSLA's 3 and 5 year returns, also with insane growth prospects, great roadmap, etc, it trades at 160 PE"
03/22/2021,stocks,"You're still not getting it.

Say Tesla's at $100 / kwh. Say Acme is at $130.

Tesla battery cost is roughly $100x100kwh, $10k, in this 400 mile scenario.

Acme's is $130x120kwh ($15.6k)in order to go the same distance. It's not the extra 20% to charge it. It's the 56% difference in price to put that battery in the car. Adding batteries is SUCH a different paradigm than just making the gas tank larger or smaller.  Not to mention it has worse driving feel because of that extra weight.

Right now 'Acme' is just eating that and making no money on their compliance cars. Or they're relying on the $7.5k tax credit because they haven't sold very many yet. Porsche I'm sure is turning a profit but they're asking ~50-100% more than the S.

It's why the CT is going to go 500 miles on ~200kwh for $70k and the Hummer is only going ~350 miles on ~220kwh for ~$130k. They CAN'T compete on price so they're adding all the bells and whistles they can to try to justify that price without losing their shirt on each one they sell.

Like I said - place your bets. I have, and I've done the research. I even come to places like this to find out the arguments which can pick apart my plan. So far, nothing."
03/22/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/22/2021,stocks,"So Tesla is where Amazon was 20 years ago when people said the space was over crowded and they wouldn't succeed. The whole personalized insurance is a massive industry that needs AI and data. Tesla is doing just this and the longest in the game, in the most countries. That's a massive leg up on the competition. Tesla has so much room to grow, whereas Amazon has reached a point where they have to branch out in order to grow. Bezos stepped down, transitions in their business model the outcome is pretty uncertain. Since companies saw how well online retail was, Amazon has competition again."
03/22/2021,stocks,They will never trade like a typical car company. Not gonna happen.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I think if you’re buying TSLA at this price, it’s cause you believe in FSD, batteries, energy potential, etc. Otherwise, you can’t really justify the price as a pure auto manufacturer. And if you do believe in this stuff, then you can’t really use a PE ratio to determine if you should buy or not. That’s why the stock is so polarizing. 

I personally am a shareholder since 2017. But I also haven’t bought any since 2019. While I’m getting more and more confident about FSD, I don’t think it’s a given."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Wow you must be more proud than Elon himself based on your obsession with Tesla. So what is your stake in the game? I bet you have over 100k invested in them? Let me know if I guessed close or far off

Honestly after looking at the efficiency ratings and milage, the difference between the 2021 Tesla Model, 2020 Kia Niro EV, 2021 Hyundai Kona, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Nissan Leaf all seem negligible at best. And the prices for those cars are all in the $32k-$40k range and most are cheaper than the Tesla.

Not to mention the Hyundai Kona actually has power consumption of 22.3 kWh/100 mi compared to the model 3's 23.0 kWh/100mi. As you can see, negligible but it still beats the Tesla. 

So your argument about battery efficiency cost and whatever does not make any sense at all. Are you saying all these other brands are losing money? 

Because it looks like they are tailing behind Tesla in just a few years. Imagine what they will come up with in 5 years down the road. Place your bets gentleman this guy has over a million invested in Tesla"
03/22/2021,stocks,500 miles is 804.67 km
03/22/2021,stocks,"I get that,  however long term if im looking at 2-3x my money that means they will need to add another 600b-1 trillion in cap making them one of the top handful of companies on the planet.  That's a lot of cap to grow by based on their sales unless they end up trading at thousands of times more on earnings.  That's a pretty high risky low reward situation.  Just my opinion"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Fair enough. I actually sold TSLA at a loss in 2019 right before the big run, but put it all into ENPH for a 10x so I'm not exactly salty lol, and have lots of friends invested in TSLA. The valuation is just pretty hard to reconcile for me. I could see the current valuation being justified in 3-4 years, but people expecting it to 10x from here and be worth >5 T, are in for a drawn out, bumpy ride."
03/22/2021,stocks,There are plenty of stocks that will 2-3x over the next decade or so. I would be surprised if FANNG+M don't all do it.
03/22/2021,stocks,That's kind of where I'm going.  Let's take DDD for example.  Less than a year they hit 10x just simply buying the under priced value. Low risk high reward. Much easier to add a billion or 2 to the cap than it would be for the 600b company at 1000x earnings to add another 600b.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I agree that Tesla's stock price growth will inevitably need to slow down, but I'm personally more than fine with FAANG+M level growth. I don't own too much regardless. My biggest positions are AAPL, MSFT, and AMZN (hence me being fine with that level of growth)."

03/22/2021,stocks,"So if rates increase from 21% to 28% for corporations and people who make over $200k per year as single filers have to pay 5% more in tax AND they get rid of the step-ups basis, you think valuations will continue to grow?

Lol."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yes. Even if companies stay flat inflation moves them forward. The only reason I see them going down would be if people can get 5 percent on their money in a CD or bonds, etc. I'd just take it and sleep better at night. 

I am just giving my current opinion. I could be persuaded on the topic. Just haven't been yet."
03/22/2021,stocks,"It seems your thesis is based on emotions.

When the taxes were cut from 28% down to 21% there was a huge move up in stocks. When they go the other way it is obvious there will be downside pressure.

I don't get why it's so hard for people to understand."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I will respond to your oversimplification with a different oversimplification. Stocks went up following the decrease in corporate tax rate because companies used the tax savings for share buybacks. Thus, the increase came from a supply shortage and not from individuals buying more shares based on a lower individual tax rate."
03/22/2021,stocks,"You can clearly see a movement in the overall market after the bill passed and it continued for while. On top of that you saw decreasing regulations (which is similar).

F. What the F do you want?

I'm not going to go over everything. The tax rate decreases clearly had an impact on the price of risk assets and money available to purchase said assets. 

What are you even debating?"
03/22/2021,stocks,Reading this makes me realize I just need more money...
03/22/2021,stocks,"Two questions:

 First, instead of buying more T with your dividends, why don't you set your account to reinvest your dividends?   Second, if your IRA and 401K are not growing 6% a year, why don't you suspend your SS? For each year you do not collect SS, your benefit grows by 6%."
03/22/2021,stocks,A 12% gain until they pull a GE and restate earnings
03/22/2021,stocks,"you can also sell some cash secured puts and make money on both sides of things. you can sell puts with a strike price of like $27-28 and collect that premium.

the odds of it striking are pretty low, and if it DOES actually strike, you're getting T shares for $27-28 which is a great pickup."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Well it took me decades to get to this level. I am 65 and retired so with access to both my and my wife's 401K's and IRA's we decided to live with our Social Security income and withdraw 4% annually from those retirement accounts.

&#x200B;

With interest rates in the dumper and AT&T being a solid company and producing a 7% annual dividend it looked like a no-brainer to just buy AT&T and hold.

&#x200B;

Juicing the income is a bonus."
03/22/2021,stocks,Yeah I have 3 shares for AT&T and I've been trying to sell it (not at a loss) the last like 6 months lol The price of the stock has pretty much stayed close to the same for a year now.
03/22/2021,stocks,"As for re-investing the dividends immediately I sometimes wait a short while if I feel (and technical's show) that a pull-back is near. That way I get more shares.

&#x200B;

As for not auto-reinvesting dividends I give this example: On my wife's 401K her AT&T dividend was automatically reinvested at $29.1886 a share on 2/1. The same day I reinvested the AT&T dividends from our other accounts at $28.79.

&#x200B;

As for SS. We are retired and need the SS income and the 4% withdrawal to live."
03/22/2021,stocks,Not going to happen.
03/22/2021,stocks,The IV on $T is so low the percentage gain for the amount of cash locked up in a CSP just isn't worth it really.

03/22/2021,stocks,Don’t you avoid taxes on automatically reinvesting the dividend.  I understand your example that you were able to buy lower.  That’s great.  But if you’re taxed 20-30% on those dividends gains is it worth it?

Since we had complete control of our investments in those IRA's, 401K's and Simple IRA's we were able to maximize our gains, limit our losses and sometimes just sit in cash like we did from the end of 2019 till June 2020.

&#x200B;

As of now all but one 401K is consolidated into IRA's that are in brokerage accounts so that we can buy and sell stocks and covered calls."

03/22/2021,stocks,"The no-brainer is because even if there is no growth the 12% annual income is more than enough for retirement.

03/22/2021,stocks,"No, They already wrote down the Direct TV investment last quarter and then sold it off to as a separate business model."
03/22/2021,stocks,Really happy for you and yours man. I hope to do as well as you did.
03/22/2021,stocks,Thank you for the tip!
03/22/2021,stocks,It's fine if T's share price doesn't keep decaying. It might or it might not.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yes. You don't need any extra cash (except to cover fees your broker may charge). You sell a covered call by offering up your 100 shares (not cash) as collateral. You can sell ITM calls at a premium and most likely have those shares called away, or you can sell the call OTM for a lower premium, and less chance of the option being exercised.

If your stock is currently at $50, and you sell a $55 call, you are only obligated to actual sell your shares at $55 if the price goes above that amount. The risk is, the price climbs, you have to sell (at the $55 level you agreed to), and then you watch the stock continue to climb while you have cash in pocket.

If the stock doesn't rise to the $55 level, you keep your shares plus the premium you had earned.

It's a balancing act between ""sell at prices near market for fat premiums and big assignment risk"" or ""sell at a further out price for smaller premiums and lower risk of assignment."" Your own risk tolerance and desire to keep the stock will play in to that decision."
03/22/2021,stocks,Ahh yes.  Makes sense.  Thank you.
03/22/2021,stocks,Direct TV isn't their only business.
03/22/2021,stocks,I will not decay.

I fact because of the backward looking investors AT&T is very attractive at $30 and will over the next few years have growth and stock price appreciation."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I mean sure, it can. However we're going on 30 years with no growth in share price and a mountain of debt. All during a raging bull market.

I think dismissing the idea of share price decay in T is a bit optimistic, at best."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I bought att in like 2011 for 28/share and sold at like 36. And it's still at 30! Lol

03/22/2021,stocks,VOO is arguably the best and safest ETF to put your money into. It’s a better idea than keeping $35k in a savings account.
03/22/2021,stocks,I’d say it’s wise. You get a secure ETF that will perform consistantly over a long period of time with minimal expenses.
03/22/2021,stocks,One of the least foolish things you can do regarding the stock market
03/22/2021,stocks,"Probably the smartest fucking thing someone on this sub has ever done and he isn't quite sure. Yes, the consistent returns of the S&P 500 with regular contributions will pay off *long* term. If you can't retire on that money you are either completely insane or the country has collapsed anyways."
03/22/2021,stocks,"VOO or VTI is about the safest most balanced option imo. VUG if you want to take on a bit more risk, which i'm not sure i'd do right now due to yield situation."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Considering the types of yolo stock plays that are posted on reddit nowadays, 50% in an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 is downright fiscally conservative."
03/22/2021,stocks,Not a terrible idea. I did the same thing and started $100 monthly contributions
03/22/2021,stocks,If you do this and don't do anything else you will beat the returns of at least 80% of this subreddit over the next 10 years
03/22/2021,stocks,"there's nothing wrong with that. it will provide a solid return over time and will be extremely hands off, so you can ""set it and forget it"".

could you make a better return with a more ""hands on"" approach? sure. either way though, you said this is savings, and it's earning nothing just sitting in a savings account so VOO is going to be a massive improvement."
03/22/2021,stocks,I have probably around 80-90%. 500 of the largest US companies across all sectors in an index is plenty diversified. If your timeframe is over 30 years or until retirement you basically just set it and forget.
03/22/2021,stocks,VTI is better
03/22/2021,stocks,"Depends, do you need that saving for anything in the next 1-5 years? If the market started to go downhill, would you wish you had that full 35k for something (like a house deposit for example)?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Your plan is one of the surest way to retire comfortably.

No, you won't become a millionaire overnight.  But you can become one after many nights.

VOO is a pretty good option for this kind of index investing.  VTI (Total US Stock Market) and VT (World Market) are considered a bit safer because of greater diversification, but as long as the US doesn't fall apart (in which case you have bigger worries anyway) VOO is a reasonably good option."
03/22/2021,stocks,"VOO is technically safer (*slightly* less volatile), but I do 70/30% VTI/VXUS. You can make the addition of 10% BND if you want to go full boomer."

03/22/2021,stocks,"VOO is great, but I wouldn't invest 50% of my savings in any one thing. Index funds and etfs are great, but even then you should diversify with different index funds and etfs. Just my $.02"
03/22/2021,stocks,smarter than me with AMC as 40%
03/22/2021,stocks,I prefer security selection. Theres too much in indexes I don't want to be exposed to. That being said indexes are a solid option for people who do not/do not want to actively monitor a portfolio.

03/22/2021,stocks,"There’s nothing wrong with voo, currently have 950 shares of it and make up around 50% of my portfolio.  I probably wouldn’t sell a single share for at least the next 20 years so definitely a long term hold for me."
03/22/2021,stocks,I'd like to know the answer to this too. There are some great comments here but one thing in confused about is should it go into a taxable account or do you make another ira account for something?
03/22/2021,stocks,"Go for it. In fact if you paid Vanguard to manage your money and told them you're 25+ years away from retirement they would do exactly that but 100% instead of 50%. They would probably dump it in VTI, actually, but you get the idea."
03/22/2021,stocks,"If you want to sleep at night then this is one of the *best* long term options you could implement.  There are also tax advantages to buy and hold; capital gains taxes can be deferred or even eliminated with step up in basis if you pass this on to your heirs.

One more suggestion I could offer; don't open an account at Vanguard.  Every brokerage is commission free.  Open your account that gives you a promotion cash bonus like E\*Trade for example.

Other things I could suggest are writing OTM covered calls on VOO when it hits a new ATH for a little more income.  Also, if this savings also represents your emergency fund then consider opening a margin account and investing all or nearly all of it in VOO.  You can borrow from margin for short term emergencies and only pay interest on borrowed funds.  It's a risk but when you are earning like 0.01% on savings accounts it may be worth it."
03/22/2021,stocks,"No, quite wise actually."
03/22/2021,stocks,Warren Buffett recommends you put 90% into VOO.
03/22/2021,stocks,VOO or VTI?

03/22/2021,stocks,"I'm not sure Vanguard going under is a negative outcome people should bother planning around, that's bordering on doomsday prepping."
03/22/2021,stocks,I have no idea why your comment got downvoted so hard. I hate Reddit for that. You’re giving tailored advice for someone who wants to put their money in and forget about it. For passive investment diversification is king because it averages out the bumps and can protect against potential losses when someone’s not looking.
03/22/2021,stocks,This comment makes no sense when VOO is as diversified as you can get
03/22/2021,stocks,"I plan to use some of it down the line for a down payment on a house, so I’ll be going into a standard brokerage account to avoid withdrawal penalties."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Vanguard has a brokerage and it is mostly free. In OP's case it is free. Also, writing calls is nice but can have tax implications."
03/22/2021,stocks,Noone ever lost money by putting their money into $VOO and never selling for 20 years. 100% chance of return.

03/22/2021,stocks,fucking madlad
03/22/2021,stocks,How is it better ?
03/22/2021,stocks,The TSLA weight makes me nervous.
03/22/2021,stocks,"VOO tries to follow the S&P as a whole but because of that, it tends to not be able to capitalize on individual sectors. A general economic downturn can be mitigated with certain ETFs or exacerbated with others. I’d be happier with 30ish% in VOO, some amount in VTI and BND, and the rest into ETFs that focus on growth industries. It’s not so much me hedging against loss as me advocating for at least some investment beyond the top 500 value stocks."
03/22/2021,stocks,I think I just explained my reasoning wrong. It seems some people saw it as hedging against a doomsday scenario which would be pointless. Also lowkey I think a lot of people put all their money in a single ETF and feel personally attacked. Which was not my intent
03/22/2021,stocks,"You forgot to mention the last 20% is split across 50 different companies. And that person has no issues keeping track of them all.

Edit: forgot to mention. This comment isn’t satire. This was another real post on this sub. A dude diversified by holding 80% in 3 stocks and the last 20% was in 50 companies."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Well ""better"" is subjective here obviously, but VT is a mix of US and International markets, and this US/INTL split is rebalanced periodically to capture the best returns. 

To answer your question that you asked another commenter, US and world markets got through trends where one will outperform the other. The US has outperformed International for the past decade or so, and this can be seen in how VTI outpaced VT. But things will probably switch back to international outperforming eventually, which is why VT is the better choice. VTI isn't bad at all though, and we're probably talking about very small differences in returns in the long run."
03/22/2021,stocks,VT is the entire world markets.  VTI is all of the US market
03/22/2021,stocks,"If one thinks they can find the right sectors and is comfortable with that increased risk that's great, given this guys intro that doesn't seem like the kind of investing they're going for."
03/22/2021,stocks,I guess I wish people were less reactive.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Historically,  do world markets do better than sticking to US only (sp500) ?"

03/22/2021,stocks,Hahahaha as do I
03/22/2021,stocks,Both International and the US have had long periods of outperforming the other.  Holding all of the world just gives you more diversification.

03/22/2021,stocks,"For what it is worth (I hope someone reads this): Boeing is an awfully run company with a terrible work environment and culture... Very toxic, with bad leadership across the entire enterprise. It will be a hard turnaround to a culture of engineering excellence... Which could lead to more subpar products out there— just a warning. Effective change management usually takes 5-7 yrs at an org to see notable change. Just be careful with this one for short-term."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Well Boing is heavy speculative anyway with Covid and 737-Max problems. If you fear losing 30% I guess such a high risk stock is nothing for you.

If another 737-Max falls from the sky, then there will be a way bigger drop. Although I really hope no accidents happen anymore.

Also many airlines choose Airbus instead of Boing, because Airbus is clearly superior at the moment in short range planes."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I have not been following BA closely for a while, but one of my biggest concerns was their reliance  on China.  With the heated rhetoric over the last four years, I am expecting [COMAC](http://english.comac.cc) to begin to supply an increase number of their internal demand.   I am waiting for China to start cancelling BA orders if the rhetoric continues and this will have an  impact  on BA and their suppliers. significantly impacting the US economy."
03/22/2021,stocks,"It just surprises me how every little movement is chalked up to manipulation, boeing is up alot over this past month so this is just people taking profits, it seems people think stock go up if there is good news up if there is no news and down if there is bad news, spoiler when there is no news it could go either way, basically the market and stocks don't always run on news, this is a classic rookie mistake when people assume a stock goes up and down based on something that has happened all the time."
03/22/2021,stocks,My stock went down! Manipulation!  In all likelihood it’s just been me buying it...
03/22/2021,stocks,"It’s actually not that big of a drop. It’s a natural correction since people are unsure about travel.

But cmon now it’s down like 4 bucks. You’re ok so long as you didn’t buy at like 260"

The market is unfairly influenced from behind the scenes and under the table and it needs to stop."
03/22/2021,stocks,Welp I’m losing my nutsack on it
03/22/2021,stocks,Like pretty much every other stock... Market‘s been rough the past weeks
03/22/2021,stocks,"It went way up between 8-12th march, it's only natural for it to have a bit of downwards movement after such a run-up...."
03/22/2021,stocks,"You’ve invested in a plane manufacture during a pandemic, what do you expect?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"> coming off a period of a couple weeks where it was going nuts.

That'll play a part in it too.

A sharp rise is going to see people taking profits knowing that it's going to pull back at some point. 

Travelling abroad 2 weeks ago was looking pretty positive, at least here in the UK. I'm currently furloughed from my job at an airport and just 2 weeks ago I was having to update all my training and sent off for a new DBS check. Then mid last week I was contacted to say that the 17th May for the return of flights is no longer looking so good."

2021-03-22 19:37:26,stocks,"The Telehealth Underdog: AMWL Announcing Q4 Earnings This Week It’s the season for Q4 earnings announcements. One that I haven’t heard much hype about yet is Amwell, which is weird to me because it’s one of the country’s largest telehealth companies. I’ve had my eye on AMWL since it’s IPO in September of 2020. The stock debuted at $18, where it issued 41.2 million shares and raised $742 million. It’s had a 52-week high of $43. So, like most stocks in recent weeks, it’s dipped a bit as COVID vaccines increase and the long-awaited stimulus checks hit our accounts. I don’t know about you guys, but *all* of my tickers have seen some hella red the last few weeks. Okay, maybe not GME and AMC… but that’s not what this post is about (for once). Most of us anticipate the market picking up, so here’s an overview of AMWL’s performance last quarter and what I’m expecting to see in Wednesday’s Q4 earnings call. 

AMWL’s first earnings announcement since going public came out last year in September. The company reported $62.6 million in revenue for the third quarter—an 80% increase year over year from $34.7 million. The pandemic driving millions of Americans to telehealth caused revenue to nearly double from 2019. Revenue directly from visits totalled $28.5 million, a nearly 300% increase from last year. Total visits also increased 455% from Q3 of 2019, coming in at more than 1.4 million. This is a decent chunk of the market considering the millions of Americans that have used telehealth in 2020. I know I have. Research shows that telehealth visits were up 154% the last week of March 2020 compared to the same period the previous year.

Now that the hard numbers are out of the way, here’s qualitative data that makes AMWL appealing. On the Q3 earnings call, CFO Keith Richards said he expected to see the upward trend continue for the healthcare company. This is due to a few things: A $100 million investment from Google, the expected continued use of telehealth after the pandemic ends and a plan to develop innovative technologies for the healthcare industry. Already, AMWL has launched new solutions to integrate in provider’s systems, making telehealth easier and more accessible. These include Amwell Now, Touchpoint Tablet software, and the C500 telemedicine cart. This could poise AMWL as a leader in the healthcare technology industry at the perfect time. 

So, what do the analysts think? Currently, analyst ratings show 4 buy and 7 hold. However, with AMWL hitting one of the lowest dips right now since its IPO, I’m thinking now is the best time to buy. I am in no way a financial analyst, but IMO, it can only go up from here. The stock price target shows a high of $45, median of $33, and low of $27, indicating that the stock is currently undervalued. At $20, this stock is an absolute steal. Let’s consider the potential growth here. With analysts predicting these numbers, even the median estimate represents a more than 60% increase from the current price of $20.15. At their high prediction of $45 a share, it would be more than a 120% growth in the next 12 months. Researchers say that the financial value of telemedicine visits is expected to reach $106 billion by 2023, with up to $250 billion of the current U.S. healthcare spending eventually shifting to virtual. This is why I’m talking about it, so why isn’t anyone else?

Earnings and sales forecasts predict $54.6M in sales and $-0.25 earnings per share. Now, should we be alarmed by this? Maybe in other industries, but telehealth as a whole has struggled to be profitable. Telehealth beast Teledoc hasn’t yet turned a profit either, with both companies posting a net loss in Q3 of 2020. I think this is the nature of the game. Telehealth is a relatively new and innovative industry, which sees the ups and downs anticipated from disruptive stocks. 

TLDR. Though the industry struggles to be profitable yet, telehealth is the way of the future. The pandemic may end soon, but this will not be the end of innovative healthcare technology that provides greater access to healthcare for millions of Americans. TDOC isn’t the only big player here. AMWL is the underdog we all need to be looking at before Q4 earnings are announced on Wednesday."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Simple counter, why pay a higher revenue multiple for a telehealth company with less market share, less diversification, and slower growth than leader TDOC?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I think it is irresponsible to not mention the 1000 lb gorilla in the room. 

[https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/amazon-confirms-nationwide-expansion-telehealth-services](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/amazon-confirms-nationwide-expansion-telehealth-services)

*After months of rumor, Amazon confirmed Wednesday that it would be expanding its Amazon Care app-based services to its employees* ***and to other companies across the United States this summer****.*  

*The announcement also said that Amazon Care would be available this week to serve other companies based in Washington.*  "
03/22/2021,stocks,What would you suggest is a good entry price
03/22/2021,stocks,I've been in on AMWL since the IPO. Have also worked on their platform (which is not so good).  If they don't have great earnings and guidance.  I think I will exit my position.
03/22/2021,stocks,Everyone should be looking at hofv
03/22/2021,stocks,"AMWL has a lower price to revenue no?

They have 25% the sales of TDOC but trade at 20% of TDOC's market cap.

Overall I'd agree to just stick with TDOC though."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Given how early we are in this massive space (digital healthcare will be multi-trillion $ industry), I would spread bets across all promising leaders (TDOC, AMWL, and others) at this point. You might check out the EDOC etf as well."
03/22/2021,stocks,Under $30
03/22/2021,stocks,Then make a post with DD. Don’t hijack/shill in a telehealth market post.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Are you factoring in Livongo revenue prior to merger for TDOC when looking back past the most recent quarter? If not that will change the numbers, I recall a wider distance between where the two are revenue wise.

I’ll add that it’s been a bit since I calculated, and AMWL has also declined materially which may have evened out the multiples if buying right now."
03/22/2021,stocks,I believe that AMWL currently has a market cap of $4.83 billion and TDOC’s is $29.16 billion.

03/22/2021,stocks,I like company but I feel that its a little over valued at moment. Especially since it has run up so much since last march.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Take this with a grain of salt ... but diversifying while Tech is down seems a little oddly timed.  Seems like now is the time to buy tech and sell it once it bounces back to diversify.  You are obviously going to do what you need to do but I wanted to get the thoughts out incase it impacts your decision.  Buy low, sell high.  


  
Edit: If tech continues to fall your original plan would be better.  I have no idea which direction it will go."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Take it for what it's worth, but Cramer pumped it a couple weeks ago.

I do own some shares personally. I think with kids sports returning next fall it will see a nice bump."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Perhaps instead of purchasing all at once, just slowly build a position in NKE. Dollar cost average it."
03/22/2021,stocks,"You're indeed buying at a high now, but keep in mind the price also dropped about 5% on Thursday when they announced quarterly earnings. I also think about it this way, what will NKE's price be during the heart of the recovery, when life is more normal, when people are more employed, they're finally able to go out, and spend their money? Will the price be higher now or then? I'd predict the price will be higher during the actual recovery.

As to why the price will go up, Nike is a cyclical stock, and people will buy more Nike products when the economy is good because it's a luxury brand. As far as COVID reasons, my thought is once we, hopefully, start recovering from this, people will buy more exercise apparel as they are allowed to return to indoor gyms.

Another big event I think of is arenas and stadiums allowing people to attend sports events again. Sports is a social event, and once people are able to attend games again and watch with friends, they'll start buying more team jerseys, shirts, and other apparel. Nike in particular might see a boost in this field because they provide the official uniforms to the big 3 sports, the: NBA, NFL, and MLB.

All that being said, if you pick the right tech stocks, I think they will for sure do much better long-term than Nike, but I also think NKE's price will be going up during the recovery and might be a good diversification play if you're looking for other areas to invest in than tech.

Edit: While I like Nike, if you're looking for an even better non-tech stock to hold long-term, I'd invest in Disney."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I like it. Run up since March, but it also pivoted very well compared to similar companies."
03/22/2021,stocks,"It’s a good company. Nike has a strong brand which creates a solid moat. Haven’t done a lot of DD on the company, but their balance sheet looks quite good. Even pays a dividend if you’re into that stuff."
03/22/2021,stocks,"It’s expensive for sure, but you are buying the market leader and innovator in the field. It is my second largest holding and I recently added more. It’s always been expensive so to speak. Their conversion model from wholesale to direct to consumer is going well as is China growth. Really not much to not like about the company. You don’t have to rush in."
03/22/2021,stocks,I like Nike and have owned it for many years. If you are looking that far out you will make money on it. With the Nike brand I don’t see any competition beating them in their main markets. There will always be competitors on the fringe taking some market share like Lulu and On Cloud but that’s to be expected and shouldn’t hinder their overall performance.
03/22/2021,stocks,Good company. Expensive stock. Never seems to trade at a reasonable PE though. Always at premium. I’d buy on the dip and keep DCAing.
03/22/2021,stocks,Drake collab incoming

Thanks for sharing! I want to be a buyer, but it’s a bit too expensive for me right now."
03/22/2021,stocks,Underrated NFT play imo
03/22/2021,stocks,"i'm typically pretty averse to investing in companies i wouldn't personally buy products from (MO is the only company i invest in but wouldn't buy from), and while nike doesn't necessarily fall into that category, they've definitely been trending that way over the last few years.

ignoring their political statements, i've found that they are making fewer and fewer shoes that i actually want (along with fewer and fewer shoes in the colors i want), and i haven't been wild about the materials they've been using on their track/jogging/athletic pants over the last few years. this lack of enticing products is also coming over a time span where they've been raising their prices.

do i think they'll be closing up shop any time soon? absolutely not. wouldn't be surprised to see them being pretty flat though."
03/22/2021,stocks,CNBC likes it
03/22/2021,stocks,"This is a precious comment, thank you. I have been trying to add more to the tech stocks as they’ve dipped the past few weeks and maybe more red days so will definitely have cash set aside for those. But just thought it’s better to start on the diversification early on so that I can build on a good foundation as more money comes in."
03/22/2021,stocks,"It's nice to see a different view, thanks a lot! I totally agree with you in terms of investing in companies you would buy products from, which is different for everyone since it always comes down to preference. I guess even if it stays flat, the dividends might be a safe bet."

Interesting suggestion

the more I look at it the more I'm convinced

Still a little unsure with how much debt they took on in 2020 & implications for paying off this debt. But looks like they have some good backers.

A little confused how their assets increased so much without corresponding increase in liability/generating profits. Perhaps there's some IP in there which is promising.

Definitely worth a look - I might leave it on the backburner to see if they're able to make use of the new assets they've acquired and can convert this into revenue"

03/22/2021,stocks,Each countries tax system is completely different so you would have to ask people from Romania for your answer.
03/22/2021,stocks,"in the us the way it works is that you only pay taxes when you sell (and only on the profits). additionally, you also get a credit for any losses that will cancel out gains. all of this gets calculated at the end of the year.

if you buy for $10k, and sell for $15k, you'd pay the appropriate capital gains rate on $5k depending on how long you held it. now, if you ALSO had another company that you bought for $10k and sold for $8k, you'd have a $2k loss. you could subtract this from y our profits, and say $5k - $2k is $3k, so you only have to pay taxes on $3k of profits.

in your country it MIGHT be similar to that, but it could be completely different. you'll have to look into how things work in romania specifically. it's likely that your country will be similar but not exactly the same."

03/22/2021,stocks,I'm a web developer and was using DO for years to host my personal projects. DO offers reliable services for very competitive prices. Their user interface is brilliant and very user friendly. Really it's pleasure to use DO. I know a lot of SMBs and agencies that use DO too. Having that said few months ago I stopped using DO and moved to AWS. I would also not invest my money with DO. I just don't see how they can compete price wise with cloud giants. Regarding user friendliness its major advantage but now we have AWS Lighthouse and similar so it's a moot point. Regarding reliability it's moot point too. 99.99% reliability is now just expected baseline feature so they don't necessarily stand out here either. I think DO is great as privately run company but as investment there's nothing great about it. They will never become hyperscale cloud giant so they are stuck fighting with millions of other cloud providers for SMBs and small private projects. Meanwhile AWS and Azure are poaching their clients. As for corporate clients they wouldn't even consider DO. I means it's really not looking pretty for DO or their investors.

“Somebody recently mentioned there is a discrepancy on P/E reporting on different sites. My advice - do not trust anybody, calculate your own number. I always use a trailing P/E based on the company reported GAAP earnings. I use my own records for that since Yahoo Finance often provides wrong information. So for the last 4 quarters JKS made $1.36 in GAAP earnings. Based on the current stock price of $44.43 its P/E is 32.7. Some other companies are reported in non-GAAP numbers, which makes them look more attractive to investors. But you should always compare apples to apples.”"

2021-03-22 17:50:36,stocks,"Bubble Recoveries: What Bears Do Not Understand A couple of Tesla and other EV bear articles for consideration:

https://www.ft.com/content/81a03045-86f7-4e57-afbd-5ff83679615f

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/tesla-in-a-bubble-and-its-going-down-fund-manager-says.html

What bears don't understand is the very real possibility of bubble recoveries.

Just a few years ago, one currency-related bubble hyped hard and crashed hard.  Guess what?  It's back, folks!

Just a couple of years ago, the pot stock bubble hyped hard and crashed hard.  Guess what?  It's back, folks!

The Tesla and other EV bears are saying that *now* is the time for the stock to crash 80%.

This morning, Cathie Wood gave a $3,000 price target for Tesla (TSLA) to hit by 2025.

Reality is probably in between both of these two arguments.

I think Tesla can hit $3,000 *before* 2025.

I also think that the stock and other hyped EV stocks *will* crash 80% afterwards.

I also think that the stock and other hyped EV stocks will recover and break past pre-crash levels within just a couple of years after their crashes.

Why is that?

Tesla and other hyped EV stocks are not Cisco (CSCO).  They are not up against 6% yields on 10-year US treasuries.  Bond yields have trended downward for decades.  Despite the howling and screaming of conservative bond vigilantes, negative interest rates could come by the time the economy takes the next big hit.

This is what bears do not understand."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I'm so confused at this post, tesla has a very high chance of crashing and coming back, it also has a high chance of crashing and never coming back. But why would you buy now a take that risk this is terrible risk reward, this is kinda like saying ""yea its overvalued but bitcoin and pot stocks came back so tesla will as well"" you also include cisco which is a very real scenario for tesla and the number of companies that have never recovered is so so much more than those that have recovered."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I'm really surprised how often Cathie Wood is mentioned on here like she's the end all authority on the matter. She's smart, she knows what she's doing, she might still be completely off with her Tesla price target. Investing in a firm that is dramatically overvalued by all classic measures is obviously risky - nobody claims that Tesla won't crash and recover, but given the chance of the crash in the first place it's not that far fetched an idea to avoid the stock at its current valuation, even if you believe in the company."
03/22/2021,stocks,If you think a stock is overvalued it is completely nonsensical to buy it imo even if you think very long term it will be higher. Shouldn't you buy stocks at areas of value in order to maximize profits?

A lot of ridiculous people out there right now.

03/22/2021,stocks,"It’s literally just macroeconomics at play - investing in the far-future when interest rates are low IS the play - there is very little risk for the companies if they require debt, for a potentially massive reward. As long term/medium term interest rates increase (10, 30 year), these prospects are less appealing, which is what we’re witnessing now. The poster believes that we will experience NIRP (which would drastically reduce the medium and long term rates) , even after Powell/FED have said time and time again, that they’re not even considering said policy. The debt market coming back is GOOD for the economy, but it unfortunately comes at the cost of speculation. 

Also if this is the start of a bear market in bonds (the bond market has been in a 40 year bull market) then the investing mindset would have to fundamentally change, since the debt/equity market are so intertwined."

Hi guys, does anyone know how or where you can see when the analysts recommendations or target price of a stock were last updated? For example, [this link](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=150&f=an_recom_strongbuy,sh_price_u5,targetprice_a50&o=price) shows stocks with a current price under $5, target price of 50% or more above the current price, and a strong buy recommendation. The one at the top, NVCN, the trading price was above the target price barely a month ago, so is that target price still valid? It has a strong buy recommendation, but was that before it hit the target price a month ago? How do you find out if its REALLY still a strong buy, and if that target price is REALLY for the upcoming 12 months? Thanks guys."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Don't listen but....do read the report. Take a view on the supporting research or thesis. It may be that they have considered an angle you haven't. You can add that Analysts viewpoint into your overall view of the stock and make your own decision. 

In answer to your question it depends on the platform you are using. BBG has all the dates easy to access. IB has the dates but you have to go into a specific section where it tells you."

03/22/2021,stocks,Who else should I listen to for price targets instead?
03/22/2021,stocks,"Fortune teller? That seems like a sensible alternative....

In all seriousness why don't you do the fundamental analysis then you're basically your own analyst?

Or.... research the stock, read what the analysts are saying, make comparisons to similar companies, examine the ratios. Make YOUR OWN investment thesis.

If this was as simple as listening to Analyst recommendations it would be stupid easy to get stupid rich....but it isn't. Analysts are wrong all the time, Barclays guy said sell PLUG at $10, went up to 70 within a few months, imagine going short at 10 after listening to that guy. 

To be constructive though, there are ways to find the best Analysts. I.e. those who have been most often right. You can probably put more weightings on their recommendations and target prices than the average publishing analyst.

The KEY is to listen to everything. But don't put equal (or indeed any) weight to all sources. Just think about everything as a whole and make a judgement."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I never said I don't do any research. Someone said not to listen to analysts, so I was just asking who better to listen to. I realize SOME analysts are wrong, but in general there are analysts who do hours upon hours of stock research every single day, and they make a living doing that, so I think their opinion is at least worth taking into consideration, instead of no listening to analysts. I would much rather take the word of someone who CNN pays thousands of dollars a month to research full time than a random redditor."
2021-03-22 17:00:45,stocks,"Is the double bottom a bullish sign because it signals the short sellers have covered? APT and VSQTF ([VST.C](https://VST.CA)N) are very different stocks that are in the very same situation.

APT has been profitable for a long time. VST became profitable last year.

APT has a lot of cash from selling covid masks. VST has a lot of cash from selling covid tests.

Both have share buyback programs.

Both are regular targets for short sellers.

Both were being shorted in the recent downturn.

Both thought good news would protect their shareholders from the dramatic drop in price. Both were wrong.

It appears that the short sellers took the price below the price point the companies wanted to maintain. The companies then started buying back their stock and raised the price, possibly to where the short sellers aren't profitable.

Is it possible the short sellers didn't have time to cover? Is that why the double bottom happens?

If so, both companies are limited to the number of shares they can repurchase in a month. That would mean the short sellers will win. It also means we have a hint as to the short sellers' target prices.

Add in FANFF ([FANS.CN](https://FANS.CN)) . This is a portfolio company of VST so VST has an interest in protecting the share price. FANS also looks like it's headed to a double bottom. The difference, for FANS, is that VST has no limit to how many shares they can purchase because buying shares in portfolio business is actually what they do."

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-22.html)

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq futures rise as 10-year Treasury yield retreats

> * The Nasdaq on Monday was set to build on Friday’s nearly 0.8% increase as the 10-year Treasury yield started the new week retreating from last week’s 14-month high. The rapid rise in Treasury yields this year have been pressuring growth stocks, many of them tech names, tech stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, which lost ground Friday, joined the Nasdaq in negative territory for the week. The Dow and S&P 500 last closed at record highs Wednesday, while the Nasdaq last closed at a record in February.

> # 2. AstraZeneca vaccine found to be 79% effective in U.S. trial

> * AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine was 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness, according to data published Monday from a 32,000-plus person Phase 3 trial in the U.S. The two-shot vaccine also showed a 100% efficacy in preventing severe disease and hospitalization. AstraZeneca plans to file with the FDA for emergency use authorization in April. The U.S. trial data comes as a number of European nations temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine following reports of blood clots. AstraZeneca said in a release Monday that an independent board identified no safety concerns related to its inoculation.

*****

> # 3. Covid cases are rising in 21 states as governors relax restrictions

> * Even as the pace of vaccinations accelerates in the U.S., Covid cases are increasing in 21 states and highly infectious variants are spreading as governors relax restrictions on businesses. Public health officials warn that while roughly 2.5 million people around the country are receiving shots every day, infection levels have plateaued this month. Nationwide, new infections are holding around 54,000 on average in the past seven days. That’s a dramatic drop from January’s peak. While deaths are much lower as well, an average of 1,000 people were still dying from Covid each day over the past seven days.

*****

> # 4. Canadian Pacific Railway to buy Kansas City Southern

> * Canadian Pacific Railway has agreed to buy Kansas City Southern for $25 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. The combination would create the first rail network connecting the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Following Sunday’s announcement, shares of Kansas City Southern rose about 17% in the premarket, while shares of Canadian Pacific Railway dropped about 2.5%. The deal comes as hopes that U.S.-Mexico trade will pick up now that Joe Biden replaced Donald Trump as U.S. president.

*****

> # 5. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest sees Tesla reaching $3,000 per share by 2025

> * Shares of Tesla rose 4% in Monday’s premarket after Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest made a long-awaited, bold call, projecting the Elon Musk-led electric auto maker would more than quadruple by 2025. Last year, Ark Invest estimated Tesla would hit $1,400 adjusted for its five-for-one stock split by 2024. The firm now sees the stock reaching $3,000 per share by 2025 in its base case, and reaching $4,000 per share in its bull case. Wood’s bear case still sees hit hitting $1,500 by 2025. Tesla, which closed at $654 per share Friday, soared 665% in the past 12 months. However, the stock over the past month and year-to-date hit a rough patch.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, March 22nd, 2021! :)**"
03/22/2021,stocks,Did Cathie lick her finger and hold it in the air prior to that prediction? Feels like a dubiously round number way too far out for anyone to remember later. Is this just a sad attempt at market manipulation? I like ARK (particularly F) but come on...
03/22/2021,stocks,And the market again drops hot around 10am and stocks go on sale.. dammit. I saw green in the premarket so I avoided.
03/22/2021,stocks,"The large tech stocks have tripled the last 5 years.  AAPL was 600B in 2016.

Let's say they 2.5x in the next 5 years.  They will then have a market cap of ~4 trillion.

Tesla could theoretically rise to $3k if current trading sentiment continues.  

What is worth is what people pay.  It's definitely extremely bullish, but I wouldn't count it out.  I could easily see it at $2k."
2021-03-22 16:43:32,stocks,"Question for you let’s say company A acquires company B in February. March rolls around and it’s time to announce Q4 earnings... Do the earnings of company B during Q4 now get combined with those of company A, even though the acquisition closed during Q1 prior to the announcement of Q4 earnings?

This is in relation to a stock I own, LMPX. They made a monster acquisition relative to their size, that I believe will balloon their earnings 5-10x. They are announcing Q4 earnings on Thursday. Will company B's numbers be counted with their own when they announce Q4 results?

Thank you in advance."
03/22/2021,stocks,"SEC requires separate reports for 9 months to two years depending on a bunch of factors.

The company will also report the combined results since there's only one ticker so that's what the bottom line is."
03/22/2021,stocks,Usually with acquisition some of those details are included. I couldn't find anything other than a press release that says they expect 700% increase in monthly revenue after the closing. Maybe in the earnings release?
03/22/2021,stocks,Seriously? I hated these algebra problems in junior high school
2021-03-22 15:56:36,stocks,"Pharma stocks are as cheap as they've been in the past 20 years. Why? The drug P/E ratio is one of the lowest among any major industry group, so much so that pharma stocks haven’t been so inexpensive relative to the S&P 500 in at least 20 years. Many pharmaceutical stocks are trading with a forward PE ratio ranging from 12 to 7,5. Abbvie has a forward PE of 7,5, Merck is at 11,5, Bristol Myers Squibb at 8, Novartis as well is trading at 12 forward PE. They all boast a 3-4% dividend yield and EPS growth forecasted between 7-10%. I do not see many downsides in investing in these companies, beside some patents expiration down the line. Despite the great cash flow and valuations this sector seems to be lagging. Why do you think it is so? In such an expensive market to see a company like Merck trade at 11 forward PE seems too good to be true, and I'd like to hear your opinion."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I think the things playing into it are:
1) COVID delayed much non-COVID related medical treatment which delays expanding user bases for drugs; while this has lessened since a year ago it’s still a real factor 

2) political concern that more legislation regarding healthcare/drug prices might be in the works following infrastructure"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I just looked up Merck and Novartis, both have a trailing P/E of ~30? (that's expensive and not cheap)

What happened? Did they fire all their employees or is it expected that they grow by 300% this year? 

I would question the data which leads to a forward P/E of 8-10, because a forward P/E is just a prediction and depending on your data source it can be way off."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Every time PFE announces good news, the stock falls.  I stopped trying to figure it out and just keep adding a little during the drops.

I own ABBV, AZN, GILD, GSK, MRK, PFE and during its recent plummet 6000 shares of VTRS.  I am heavily weighted drugs and have been since just before the pandemic.  I assumed, incorrectly, that they would all soar.  They haven't but I am holding all of them since they all pay nice dividends to wait."
03/22/2021,stocks,VRTX is also cheap right now and has big cash pile and decent growth pipeline.
03/22/2021,stocks,I believe the reason ABBV is so cheap rn is because their Humira patent is expiring which as been one of the most profitable drugs of all time. Still think it’s a sound investment though and Buffet investing in it is always a good sign
03/22/2021,stocks,I see most pharma stocks as a roulette table in which they live or die by the FDA
03/22/2021,stocks,"Question:
Which company will be providing the treatment for the millions of covid long haulers?
This syndrom ist still mercy (symptoms / treatments) to me but after the acute phase of the pandemic, their will be a huge group of people beeing in need of longterm medical attention."
03/22/2021,stocks,You’ve prompted me to do some analysis on these guys.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I'm curious as well. I'm bullish on GILD and have had a moderate position in them for the last year. P/E of 9, Forward P/E of 12, 4.4% dividend. I feel like a lot of these non-vaccine pharma companies have a lot of opportunity for growth in the next few years because CoVID has caused people to completely ignore chronic conditions. Cancer diagnoses were way down in 2020, because people were seeing their doctors less, not because there are fewer cancers. I think there might be a bit of an explosion in people seeking treatment for said conditions later this year/next year. Feels like a relatively safe long-term play to me, especially because of the very reasonable current valuations."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Forward p/e is a bad metric tho, tell us why its cheap now without cheating with targets and forward wtv please"
03/22/2021,stocks,Good questions I don't know the answer. I hope someone knowledgeable gives some insight.
03/22/2021,stocks,Super cheap pharma biotech is GILD. PE on 2021 expected EPS is 9 and a dividend yield of over 4.4%. Solid cash flow of $8 B a year.
03/22/2021,stocks,Just wait till the US gets regulations on medicals . Its a super risky investment imo because you wont know how long they are allowed to sell a bottle of insoline for multiple hundreds of dollars :D
03/22/2021,stocks,"Making money on sick and dying people is scummy, I’m all for investing but not in this"
03/22/2021,stocks,"You guys just haven’t figured out tech is insanely overvalued. You are just comparing a bubble market to a mature one. You just discovered old car companies and pharmaceuticals. What’s next Walmart, oil and gas lol"
03/22/2021,stocks,"1. This is true, but I see it more as a bull case: when covid situation gets better there should be a backlog of demand for several products (for example botox from Abbvie). It is a good point but could be played both ways.
2. Political concerns could be a good answer. Valuations look still very cheap, even assuming a cut in profitability, but I will keep an eye to the proposed legislations in the future."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I use mainly Finviz and Bloomberg to check for data. Yahoo finance as well. I started checking these companies after Buffet bought large stakes in Abbvie, MRK and BMY just recently. There are several articles as well discussing how the forward PE of these companies is so low. Trailing yes it is in the 20s or 30s. But if I check now on Bloomberg it gives me a PE for Merck of 13.84."
03/22/2021,stocks,I've also found this article very interesting https://www.barrons.com/articles/big-pharma-battled-the-pandemic-the-stocks-are-cheap-51615595798
03/22/2021,stocks,"I haven't looked into PFE much at all, but they are projected to bring in less earnings this year then they did last year when I checked yahoo finance a while ago. I assume they have some patents expiring which are hurting their earnings.

Pharmacy companies have a certain amount of Random Number Generator involved in how well they do. They could spend billions on R&D for a bunch of new drugs and come up completely empty without a thing to show for it. Or they could find the next super profitable Humira or something like that. I think that's part of why companies like JNJ are more stable and trading at a premium compared to companies that are purely a pharmaceutical play. They have 2 other big non-Pharma segments to fall back on."
03/22/2021,stocks,As a group they can’t be beat consistent earnings growth. That’s why my biggest play is VHT.
03/22/2021,stocks,NYT reported that some long-haulers feel better after the vaccine. (link: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/world/reinfections-are-rare-some-covid-long-haulers-respond-to-vaccines-the-week-in-coronavirus-news.html - includes link to preliminary study).
03/22/2021,stocks,"You’re going to want to look into biotech treatments, specifically for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.  

ATHX is a company with an ongoing clinical trial in Japan for their drug’s treatment of ARDS."
03/22/2021,stocks,Ctxr also has a product due for fda review next year for “long haulers”
03/22/2021,stocks,"That's why they have several pipelines. Just because the US would regulate some types of medication, doesn't mean they can demand treatments for zero-profits. This argument holds no grounds in reality. 

Also, wouldn't trust a single word about Biopharmaceuticals from someone that's not even able to spell insulin. Seeing as NONE of the mentioned companies produce it even.. but whatever, ""risky investment"""
03/22/2021,stocks,Same story past 13 years. Dems never have the votes.
03/22/2021,stocks,...or investing money into helping sick and dying people get better. It’s all in how you perceive it.
03/22/2021,stocks,"You're getting a lot of flack, but I respect that you've drawn a line on something.

Maintaining investments in capitalism and trying to avoid positions that are personally immoral can be really difficult. Sometimes impossible. There's sectors/industries I avoid entirely for personal reasons as well."
03/22/2021,stocks,"First, I totally respect that opinion.  


I see it a little different.  Whether I 'invest' or not is pretty much irrelevant to the pharma.  But any gains I take away from their stock I can reinvest in better ways.  As long as I'm profitable long-term, and not leaving money in the market, then I'm the one that will have the option on how to spend those profits - meaning I can take cash away from people that won't spend it in helping others, and use it in better ways.  Of course, all that assumes I will be more selfless than those others.  


Still, I see your perspective and respect you for it."
03/22/2021,stocks,"All major corporations are making money on the back of workers, cheap labour in developing countries, the environment, sick people etc. If morality is what you're after, the stock market is not the right place. Making money investing in Apple means you're ok with child labour in China, Amazon exploits its workers, Tesla batteries need lithium which is mined in many places with harmful chemicals that pollute the soil and water, cobalt as well is needed and extraction is done exploding child labour in Congo. I understand your point, but again the whole capitalistic system is immoral."
03/22/2021,stocks,Tech will always seem over valued because they are considered growth stocks.
03/22/2021,stocks,Thanks
03/22/2021,stocks,"Indeed, I find people's comments say more about themselves."
03/22/2021,stocks,"But people don’t have to buy that junk, and no one has to work there, it’s just greed, healthcare isn’t an option, I can’t take advantage of people who need help, it’s different"
03/22/2021,stocks,Not too long ago MSFT traded at a PE of 15. This is just not true.
03/22/2021,stocks,"For many people working at Amazon or not is not an option. That is why they can keep low wages and terrible conditions: many people need that job to survive and are willing to accept those conditions because they've no choice. Again I understand what you mean and it's your right to invest in what you belive it's right, but don't be naive the whole market is built on the exploitation of the weak."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Healthcare is literally an option in the US, you don’t have to buy that junk either"

2021-03-22 14:43:03,stocks,"Top 3 stocks for the next 20 years If you could only invest in 3 stocks for the next 20 years what would they be? 

Things to consider -

Will we be living in a cashless society? If so stocks to consider - square, MasterCard, PayPal etc 

Technology will be as big as ever, computers will be very powerful - stocks to consider - Apple, Microsoft etc

Will most cars be electric? Stocks to consider - Tesla and nioo

(I’m super bullish on nioo in the long run I think they will be massive especially as they expand)"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Disney - Disney plus is gonna be even more massive in the future. Theme parks will still be a thing.

Microsoft - Azure, Teams and Gamepass. Those 3 will be unstoppable.

Apple - They will keep innovating their phones."
03/22/2021,stocks,"For the highest return, you need something that is just about to start, but clearly will be revolutionary.

The only field that gives me that feeling is gene editing and CRISPR technology."

03/22/2021,stocks,"TER - Semiconductor equipment / automation - 5G supercycle while pivoting to automation long-term, great management, strong and growing earnings and cash flow.

ILMN - Take advantage of genomic field without having to pick sides. ILMN sells equipment to everyone and has a near monopoly on the industry. Small upstarts are looking to enter but ILMN can outpace with their cash flow and cash position. 

HON - the Softwarization of industrial processes - the industrial conglomerate of the future. Great management and strong cash flow, growing earnings, etc. 

URI -  Great growth stock priced like a value stock because of the debt load. They were able to make pay down a huge chunk of the debt this year during COVID which was a good sign. Overall they are set to benefit from the construction industry, and a possible infrastructure bill. They have diversified into Porta-Potty's as well so when live events open back up that will be an additional windfall for them."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Alright I’ll try to predict the future a little, but I could be completely wrong

SQ/PYPL - they’re both just really disruptive to brick and mortar banking in a world that’s moving more digitally 

Nano Dim.. - Unless another 3D printing company ends up outpacing them in innovative tech this is a long hold. In the future I see cost declines and further innovation in 3D printing to lead to a large amount of more complex electronic components and small manufacturing components to be 3D printed. Not only that but 3D printing will allow for more complex components to be manufactured. Right now this company seems to me to be moving in the right direction if that’s the future that happens. 

ENPH - unless someone cracks Nuclear Fusion, solar energy will likely be in a good spot in 20 years compared to where it is today, and ENPH is just my favorite company in the industry, TAN would likely also be good 

As far as other stuff to look out for in my opinion, autonomous delivery services (Cars or Drones), gene editing, AI advancements, and better or new energy storage solutions"

03/22/2021,stocks,"I am long on all three sector you explained (cashless payments / technology / ev).

And I am ETF heavy in all three sectors because I believe there are too many companies that I cannot decide which one is correct for the future - therefore ETF such as Ark is really attractive and I own most of them.

I had a large position in NIO but recently reduced my position and increased it in Tesla Instead. It's not that I doubt Nio, but more so I am scared of the competition from the ""big players"" meaning the car companies that were traditionally ICE (internal combustion engines) and now making the switch to EV. Tesla I believe is more than just an EV car company and they have Elon who is an extremely powerful influencer today. 

I.E. Volkswagen, Toyota, BMW

These three companies will be heavy heavy players in the EV field, and you can see the commitment each of the companies are already putting forth. They are basically going All in on the EV era. For that reason I am scared for the pure EV companies such as NIO, Lucid, Nikola, Xpeng, Li auto etc

Just my 2 cents."

They sell lots of merch and are basically an ETF with all the different sectors they are in. They also have a cult following and huge brand loyalty.

Apple: Track record of constantly innovating and main driver in trends for mobile technology. Has spread to other sectors and has grown its own ecosystem and now created a technology stack that works flawlessly together (M1 chip, software, hardware). They also have a cult following and huge brand loyalty.

Tesla: Frontrunner in innovations in Electronic Vehicle technology. Already have multiple electronic vehicles and a charging network created. Have pipeline for electric trunks, cyber truck, and roadster which are all highly anticipated. Possible path for autonomous cars in the future and already have valuable data assets from their users.

03/22/2021,stocks,"$DG DOLLAR GENERAL
     With the advent of DoorDash deliveries, and the limited selection of cheap goods in rural areas, Dollar general is exploding in growth and opening tons of stores. Dollar general will be the prime target for DoorDash to utilize for home essentials on the platform. I'm speaking from experience, I'm a doordasher, And I can tell you I would much rather go shopping for somebody at Dollar general versus Walmart or CVS.
   If you live in the boonies, You're only options for the essentials are gas stations, pharmacies, or Dollar general. Dollar general happens to have much better prices than the other two options. This creates a path of least resistance for  customers. The store is also very smart with picking a good variety of items to stock in the store, making much better use of the space than other stores, such as ALDI.
   I have noticed a lot more of the storage opening up in my own home city, And from people I talk to who live in other towns it is going on the same way. Dollar general is one of the few places I don't mind shopping.

$DBX DROPBOX
       Remote work will continue to evolve, The need for digital workspaces is growing. The need to send and verify secure documents is also a growing demand. Many companies Will alter and become office free environments soon.
         All of our videos, pictures, music, art, creations, are all stored on the cloud. Every year that data that we store gets bigger and bigger and we have more files added to it every year. Currently, the big tech companies are subsidizing the pricing for cloud storage and offering it to us consumers for free. This will not always be the case though, and once they stop subsidizing the cost of cloud, it won't be a charity anymore. Dropbox holds a sizeable portion of the market of cloud, And as more people use more space, The idea of paying for cloud every month is going to be more ubiquitous amongst consumers.
     They also have a stellar balance sheet, completely undervalued for a SAAS company, and have been a  sticky service for over a decade with some of the biggest names for competition. They built out their own servers and do not rely on Amazon AWS like 99% of other companies online. Could also be a great acquisition Target, But they will make better gains for investors as a solo company.

Probably talking more like 5 years for that. It’ll be interesting to see how the US vs China dynamic plays out in Africa. JMIA are obviously aware of and making sure they try and capitalise on China’s desire to invest in Africa. But, are they western enough to give companies like Amazon a stake in the African eCommerce space? Downside is probably more that, if the company capitalises on its growth, they get bought out by something like a BABA. Also, TIA. Plenty of political turmoil in store."

My favorite innovation was when they removed the audio jack. Now I can’t listen to music and charge my phone unless I pay for Bluetooth headphones or the splitter. 

Wait we can’t forget about this last innovation. Now a $700 iPhone doesn’t come with a wall adapter. I have to spend extra to get one. 

I don’t know which is my favorite. But personally they need to innovate their charging cable to last longer. The thick $10 cables from Walmart last longer than theirs do."

03/22/2021,stocks,Poor logic unless you have a crystal ball because historically big stable companies keep growing as the economy grows. Smaller companies are highly volatile and you don't know what they're going to do.

03/22/2021,stocks,"AMD is also in the CPU space while NVDA is mostly GPU. So AMD also has Intel’s share to eat, and lately their CPUs are far superior to Intel’s offerings."
03/22/2021,stocks,"In addition to the other comments, I'll add that AMD also produces the gpu chips for both the new Xbox and PS5. They're one of the only games in town in two major computer-related areas and they have held their own against the much larger Nvidia and Intel on the consumer PC side."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Of course, this is the standby advice of most stock recommending services (i.e Motley Fool). Don't gamble at all on the smaller companies, pretty much load up on things that have already increased 1000 fold or more. AMZN is a top pick there as well, so why not drop $100K and pick up 28-30 shares. Just like everything in life pretty much, the bigger the gamble the bigger the payoff I guess."
03/22/2021,stocks,I saw a stat on the news (likely bullshit since i'm american) that less than 100 kept it from IPO to the $3000 price point and really made it big off of that

03/22/2021,stocks,All things pass. Jack Ma still has tremendous influence in the CCP he is just being temporarily reprimanded for speaking out of turn. Eventually it will be forgotten after some new antitrust laws and shit land.
03/22/2021,stocks,they are but Nvidia is leaning into AI now while AMD isn't to my knowledge

03/22/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't be too sure about that.  If that were the case then Apple wouldn't have survived the 80s when they were producing proprietary computers that were purposefully incompatible with virtually every other PC in the world and charging double or triple the price.

They've been a trash company for a long time.  It works for them.  They cater to people looking for a status symbol."
03/22/2021,stocks,"This is exactly why Samsung waits for Apple to introduce a controversial change and then copies them a year later once they see the market trends.

Apple knows the value of their brand and they seem to have a pretty good grasp of how far they can push the boundary before customers migrate to another ecosystem."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Nah so long as influencers (kardashians, d'amelios, mrbeast, etc) all use iShit then the company will continue to be more status symbol than product."
03/22/2021,stocks,"But they -don’t-.

Apple has done the market research.  Millions of dollars on consumer surveying and analysis and the end result is that that no cables, Bluetooth first, etc are huge wins for many times more customers than for those that it isn’t.  Even with the complainers accounted for.  This is basic due diligence for any move that the most valuable company in the world makes."
03/22/2021,stocks,🤦🏻‍♂️
03/22/2021,stocks,"Not exactly.

Being an expert in CRISPR tech doesn't mean you're an expert in business fundamentals and have a solid understanding of valuation and can due the appropriate DD.

You don't need to be able to use CRISPR to be able to see which company has the best team, contracts and is using the tech..

At least that's how I understand it.  Maybe someone with more insight could jump in here"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I think so, I never thought about it like that but it would explain it. I know too much so am hesitant to commit to knowing anything, because I know how much we don't know, and how uncertain the field is!"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I'm not OP, but because then you have no diversity in your portfolio. If amazon goes red and bleeds you could have other stock/etf to be your stability. One could argue that half of playing the game is hedging your investments with other investments in differently sectors."
03/22/2021,stocks,So it's no more than a meme.
03/22/2021,stocks,I looked at PDD and thought they share price accelerated to quickly.  I will not touch them until they get below $80.  I really do not like the grocery play that is being mentioned.
03/22/2021,stocks,Not worth it in the meantime.
03/22/2021,stocks,That’s true. Hopefully I can mitigate risks with my positions.
03/22/2021,stocks,"exactly, apple is now almost a status now. I do not own a single Apple product, but I am very high on their stock and will continue to buy into it."
03/22/2021,stocks,That typically happens the other way around
03/22/2021,stocks,We here to talk about stocks and making money or to bitch about brands we don’t like?
03/22/2021,stocks,"IMO Apple should make it to where people can sign up for their Apple Credit Card before buying an iPhone. And if they use their Apple Credit Card to buy a new phone, Mac or iPad, they get 5% off. 

I’m sure enough people would be like “sign me up and charge me!” And this miss a payment and take on the interest."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I’d rather have a charging cable that doesn’t break after a month. It’s sad the Walmart charging cables last longer than Apple’s. But that’s just me. 


I’d also like to have a wall adapter in the box after I spent $700. But that’s just me. 


I’d like the option of having a normal audio jack instead of having to buy Apple’s headphones which cost significantly more. Or am forced to run Bluetooth. 

Same thing with the stand for the Pro Display XDR. The **$5000 display** doesn’t come with a stand....instead you have to pay another $1000 for the stand or you can buy the $200 VESA mount adapter."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Sorry, I was actually being a bit tongue in cheek with the Amazon quip. Personally it seems like buying a company that requires such massive capital to acquire now makes little sense for the average investor that might only have $100K total or less to invest."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Bingo.

I detest Apple products but I appreciate them and the company...if that makes sense"
03/22/2021,stocks,No it doesn’t..
03/22/2021,stocks,"Gotcha lol. I didn't pick up the tone correctly. I just automatically assume everyone is at basic level of understanding lately. Honestly I'd be interested in seeing someone's portfolio full of one stock tho. Like a BRK-A/B portfolio, or AMZN, or something else to that regard."
2021-03-22 14:13:18,stocks,"Apple Fined $2M In Brazil For Shipping iPhone 12 Without Charger Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been fined nearly $2 million in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo for selling the iPhone 12 series without chargers.

What Happened: Brazil’s consumer protection agency Procon-SP decided to fine Apple for the tech giant’s decision to remove the power adapter from the boxes of iPhone 12, MacRumors reported, citing Brazilian tech news outlet Tilt.

The watchdog said Apple’s move violated the Consumer Defense Code, according to the report. The tech giant has also been fined for allegedly misleading consumers about the water resistance in iPhones and for declining to repair iPhones that suffered water damage under warranty.

https://m.benzinga.com/article/20271423"
03/22/2021,stocks,This was probably cheaper than producing and shipping the chargers and will be seen as a business expense.
03/22/2021,stocks,Apple: Oh no. Anway..
03/22/2021,stocks,They will never financially recover from this
03/22/2021,stocks,That’s like fining me $2
03/22/2021,stocks,Wait until they find out Tesla sells cars without chargers
03/22/2021,stocks,"""if the punishment for a crime is a fine, then that law only exists for the lower class.""

OFF WITH THEIR HEADS"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Doing a quick calculation.  

Apples cash pile is $195Billion as of January. The best high yield savings account is 0.4%.  Divided by 12 is 0.0333%. That rate times the $195Billion cash pile is $65Million. $65M/30 is $2.16M

So Apple could literally put all of their cash in an Ally savings account, and they could pay off the fine in a single day of accrued interest."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Lol, they need to sell one iphone and a macbook and that'll cover the cost"
03/22/2021,stocks,They will probably pass the cost on to the consumer ;)
03/22/2021,stocks,And I guess by selling phones without a charger they saved the 10x amount.
03/22/2021,stocks,lost-in-the-washing-machine money
03/22/2021,stocks,Pfff 2m is less than chump change for a company like Apple. These fines should really take into account a company's revenue if they want tgem to be impactful. Otherwise this 2m fine is meaningless news and Apple can keep on doing what they're doing. It'll cost them way more to sell their phones with chargers than pay the fine
03/22/2021,stocks,Wish my parking fines were this miniscule
03/22/2021,stocks,That is literally nothing to them
03/22/2021,stocks,I loled hard at the $2M fine.
03/22/2021,stocks,What are they going to do?!
03/22/2021,stocks,"Tim Cook: let me just look in my couch, get back to you....oh wait. here it is, keep the change."
03/22/2021,stocks,I have so many old iPhone/iPad boxes at home where the chargers/charging cables or earbuds (back when they shipped them with the phone) are still packed within those boxes because....well....didn't really need one with each phone that was purchased
03/22/2021,stocks,This is like us getting fined a nickel.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Funny how everyone is defending a company that willfully wronged consumers.

03/22/2021,stocks,Really worried about Apple now. Going to sell all my share today. Not sure how they are ever going to recover from this.
03/22/2021,stocks,“LOL”  said apple
03/22/2021,stocks,This explains the drop in share value
03/22/2021,stocks,2m is like$ 0.00000000002 for apple lol
03/22/2021,stocks,"So what is that? 1% of their current cash on hand? Well fk, apple going bankrupt"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Honest question, if this is true, is it worth for Apple to challenge this? Or just pay up?"
03/22/2021,stocks,Sao Paulo is doing a quick money grab. A $2m fine is nothing for Apple. Could've gotten more.
03/22/2021,stocks,They can sell 50 phones and pay that fine.
03/22/2021,stocks,Typical Apple
03/22/2021,stocks,They probably saved more money not giving them chargers😂
03/22/2021,stocks,"Holy shit, my wife has dropped her iPhone XR in a bucket of water designed to feed a tile saw, sat in there until the pump stopped working. Only found it because we looked at what was causing the water to stop. Then she dropped it in a toilet once, and in a sink with water. 

The phone still works perfect... what the hell are these people doing to their phones?


Edit: they really should send the charger though."
03/22/2021,stocks,To them that’s like getting fined a mcdonalds hamburger with small fries
03/22/2021,stocks,"They probably make that much in interest every day with their 200b cash pile in tbills . 

And interest rates are near zero."
03/22/2021,stocks,There are approximately 18 million iPhones sold in Brazil. This is a bargain for Apple.
03/22/2021,stocks,Being Fined $2M and paying $2M are not the same thing. Heck they will pay $5M in legal costs get it down to a few $100K. Off set that by the savings of not including it in the first place and virtue signal they are hugging the earth all at the same time it won't even be a blip on the bottom line.
03/22/2021,stocks,Only 2 mill? Apple made out like a bandit on that one.

03/22/2021,stocks,Brazil has balls
03/22/2021,stocks,Why did they fine so little? I’m sure their politicians aren’t stupid enough to be ignorant of apples wealth. Maybe they chose a figure just high enough that Apple wouldn’t contest it? Idk
03/22/2021,stocks,"Apple: oh no! 

Anyway"

03/22/2021,stocks,Not the law suit itself. Are the now legally bound to sell iPhone 12 with chargers now?
03/22/2021,stocks,I literally yesterday I asked my older brother who got a new iPhone if I can use the adapter because I lost mine. They had it coming.
03/22/2021,stocks,Shit how they gonna pay that
03/22/2021,stocks,2 million! That is pocket change for them! Wtf
03/22/2021,stocks,"Low quality and apple, the perfect pair"
03/22/2021,stocks,Probably cheaper than having a meeting to discuss whether or not to produce and ship the chargers as time is money and Apple makes a shit ton of it
03/22/2021,stocks,"They still do produce and ship chargers. You just have to say, like with a nintendo ds, ""hey can i have a charger too i don't have a usbc v3.0 yet"" ""sure, but you lose your 25$ no charger discount""."
03/22/2021,stocks,It cost more to fire up the legal team. Lawyers getting richer!
03/22/2021,stocks,i can assure they never even said oh no.

03/22/2021,stocks,"They save nor make any money, the cost of the charger is passed on to the consumer in the first place anyway."
03/22/2021,stocks,The point was to line the pockets of politicians while simultaneously appearing virtuous for “defending” consumers. Corporations see this as cost of doing business and the fine will be laundered into the politicians pockets behind the scenes.
03/22/2021,stocks,Hey where are from in Baltimore?
03/22/2021,stocks,I'm on the hate Apple train as much as the next person but comments haven't been defending them. They've just been pointing out how 2m fine isn't very much to Apple.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Willfully wronged? By giving you a 25$ discount if you already have a charger or want to buy it cheaper second hand, but if you still want it, you can still get it at the same place you got your iphone from?

They just don't have the choice for the charger to be in the same box as the iphone, merely the same store."

03/22/2021,stocks,Note that you didn’t say if they were working chargers. They tend to fizzle out around the two-year mark just like the phones.

And you get to save money on chargers next time you buy phone. Man, sure is good they separated the charger from the device.

>I would be ok with at least 1 coming with the box

It does, you just lose your 25$ or whatever the amount discount. And it comes with the box, not in the box. You still get both from the same human being together though. 

And now that it's separate from the phone, it's way less likely to be out of stock, since shops don't have tens of chargers that they can't sell without also selling the phone."

I woke up this morning to the orders having been triggered at the bell. I didn’t want to get out of these positions. But I guess the way that I set them up, they just got triggered by ANY price better than the one that I entered. Sheer negligence on my part. I did realize some small gains, but didn’t want to get out of these. So now hopefully I’ll buy back in if they dip a little. I won’t be making that mistake again. The crash course on (self taught) investing continues. Almost 4 months into it and getting smarter and stronger every day. My portfolio is currently around break even. So, with that said these lessons have been relatively free so far. Which I look at as a gain in itself."

Cronos got gobbled up. Organigram got gobbled up by BTI.(BTI is a good play too)

MO has the slick branding. The cash. The distribution network. The land network to grow at reduced cost. They're selling cbd products at ULTA. They put Kristen belles face on it.

Aphria Tilray etc are jockeying for distant thirds at best. Dr pepper style. Smaller companies are unprofitable or are surviving because it's the wild west and the big guys aren't really in yet.
There will be smaller operators who survive, because of street cred. 

 Corporate pot is the future. Bet on the bad guys.

It's another J. Powell week! Get ready, because anything is possible.

So far, things are looking pretty good. J. Powell is talking about bank innovation *as I type this*, and the markets aren't crashing with every word he says, which is a positive sign.

Tomorrow and Wednesday are the big ones, when J. Powell testifies to the U.S. House and Senate. He says the same thing every time he talks, so we all know what he's going to say, but get ready for the markets to completely freak out as if nobody could have expected him to say things like: ""We're targeting 2% annual inflation"" and ""We will not increase interest rates.""

Technicals just turned bullish, so I'm optimistic about this week -- but be forewarned that, when J. Powell talks, my predictions are proven wrong.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 13,422** and a **low of 13,222**. That's a 1.5% increase over yesterday close at today's highest point, though I believe we'll be a bit lower than that when we close.

You can see how J. Powell has ruined my [past predictions here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/1Jw6B)."

It's going to pull back some more most likely and it will be interesting to see if tech can hide cyclicals pulling back like it did for most of January until the last few days, but any ideas of us having the market that we had in 2020 which was mostly tech until the final quarter will be a mistake."

03/22/2021,stocks,Probably will dip first. Then after a few days (or maybe a couple weeks) after that dust settles it can finally begin to reach its potential. I've been waiting for them to get under $30 again so I can get some.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Completely agree. When pot gets federal legalization, imo youre basically gonna have four groups fighting for market share. Black/grey market fighting for relevance, Canadian companies, local US companies in legal states, and big Tobacco. 


Black/grey market is gonna be forced to pull all kinds of moves to stay relevant. Im in Canada, and from what Ive seen they typically have cheaper concentrates, sell edibles stronger than the legal limit, sell weed to those under 21 (in quebec) and sell cheaper weed of higher quality. Legal weed is starting to catch up in terms of pricing and I have no doubt that eventually grey market weed is gonna get phased out. But those first couple of years where grey market weed keeps some market share is gonna be killer for smaller US producers. Seeing how conservative the US is, I have almost no doubt that in the event of federal legalization, theres gonna be a bunch of caveats. No concentrates, 21 age limit, no edibles, shit packaging etc. Bigger companies can ride this period out of greater competition much better than small US producers. 

Canadian companies are a bit of a wild card. I have no clue how the US is going to handle foreign weed imports. Im staying off for a bit. 

Smaller weed producers tend to have thin margins, and no backup. Theres also been a big issue of glut. Everytime a state legalizes weed, there ends up being more producer's and dispensaries than needed; imo only a few local players will be able to survive the culling. Not to mention the aforementioned black market competition. 


Large producers like MO are gonna end up dominating the cannabis industry. Its not like tobacco is going anywhere, so theyll have some sort of income to rely on during those turbulent few years. Seeing MO lobby for legalization has made me extremely bullish on them."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I agree. The sentiment has been ""keep the tobacco corporations out of cannabis"" from the activists but the big boys would be able to push legalization through so much faster.

With the sigma around the tobacco industry, those guys will be looking to broaden their business. This is the perfect opportunity to do so. Unless the legislation somehow prevents it, we're going to see someone come in and throw weight around to become the industry leader."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Agree that big tobacco will continue to buy the weed stocks.  Though $MO owns 43% of CRONOS, that position is only 1/5000th of $MO’s total valuation.  To capture this movement, it may be best to purchase weed stocks directly and enjoy the ride up as big tobacco continues to buy.  I hold $MJ, $APHIA, and $CRON."

That being said, there is some tandem-like behavior of the two.  I own both - they constitute a large position in my portfolio.  I have no intentions of selling either.  They’re both very liquid and provide good candidates to write options (FD’s, out of money) for regular additional earnings."

this past feb was a lesson for newbies entering in the tech market at ATH's due to euphoria and fomo.

03/22/2021,stocks,"I feel you but depending on the stocks you have I would wait a little, at least don't take losses by selling now. I'm 99% certain when the US get's it's inflation numbers for Q2 or maybe Q3 we will see a sell off like a few weeks back, maybe even worse. My assumption is that we will see inflation numbers in the range of 2.2%-3% and possibly higher a Q after that. This is entirely normal but the market will react strongly to this. This inflation is not like regular inflation, it is caused by overspending among other things. When there is more demand than there are products prices will increase and this will happen. At this point crucial components like semiconductors are scarce. [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/21/global-shortage-in-computer-chips-reaches-crisis-point](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/21/global-shortage-in-computer-chips-reaches-crisis-point)) 

This will cause many tech companies issues. It is not unlikely they will fail to meet their projected sales/incomes/earnings/production quota's due to a lack of these crucial components because they have issues in the supply chain. Companies will have to raise prises for their products to compensate. 

I'm planning to increase my positions at this dip making sure my avg buy is going to be a lot more attractive. Once the supply chain issues are fixed (maybe Q4 2021 or Q1 2022) we will go to the moon with our tech stocks. I'm currently only selling some of my stocks just to have some extra cash for buying later. I don't work on margin so I don't have to worry about that. But if you do, you might want to check how deep you are in atm before the next dip comes."

VP is actively in favor of reform, despite her flawed past with it as well

I am not bullish on federal legalization like what a possible majority of cannabis investors are. But legalization isn't the only mover. Federal decriminalization and NY legalization will see significant gains in weed stocks and both are extremely realistic within the next 2 years. I plan on selling a good portion of my shares then and possibly buying back in when things go back down, if federal legalization seems like it is on the table (I won't buy back in until after midterms so I can see what the political landscape is and make sure America doesn't go full fucking Y'allqaeda, which can absolutely happen with Dem vote apathy)."

Weird market right now."
03/22/2021,stocks,Uh... why pay if I can get free answers from here?
03/22/2021,stocks,"Well I am getting an accountant or something for taxes this year (my sister is, so I'll probably share it with her). So I might ask them. 

So it does mean that if you made a ton in short term gains, but can't afford to pay taxes on them if you lost it all in other investments, that you can actually end up in the negative? I'm still up over a million, but I'm thinking of HODLING, but of course scared that if NIO tanks I'm in some trouble."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Nope. I was wrong in that account.

So I'm not sure how the short term gains period works, but I believe it's basically all yearly.

So if you made $1000 on one trade in short term gains in 2021, then reinvested and sold for a $300 loss also in 2021. You only pay taxes on $700.

With that being said I believe it goes like this... if you made $1,000,000 in 2021, but on like January 2, 2022, you sold your entire portfolio for a $700k loss.

You will have to pay taxes on the $1,000,000. But for the $700k loss, you can only deduct $3000, since they are different tax periods. That's my understanding of it. So that's the case where you can end up negative (if you owe more than $300k in taxes, due to your $1,000,000 in 2021)."
03/22/2021,stocks,That and negative earnings have to be big factors:  18.1B book - 11.35B debt = 6.75B.  Shouldn't that 6.75B act as a floor though?  Market cap is 6.269B.
03/22/2021,stocks,This is what I’m worried about. I started investing in primarily tech and renewables in mid-February and was advised “time in the market is better than timing the market” and my entire portfolio is down ~5%.

03/22/2021,stocks,You should be golden if your ok with holding for some more years.
03/22/2021,stocks,"BB...one of these is not like the others, lol"
03/22/2021,stocks,Is twitter the new Hub?
03/22/2021,stocks,So Twitter might launch paid tweets. I don’t think it would cut into onlyfans that much. Of already has 1million content creators
03/22/2021,stocks,"Wouldn't surprise me, but if that were to be the case, that would mean .IXIC jumps almost 8% after one more move down and then sells off once again after OPEX, with cyclicals showing relative strength.

There is somebody that is a good technician that was actually suggesting that you could see ""sell in May and go away happen after mid April""."
03/22/2021,stocks,Some things are worth paying for.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I don't know enough to help you other than to say you probably don't want to be posting about it on reddit. Seriously, that's a lot of taxes left unpaid if you don't pony up. Just get professional consultation."
03/22/2021,stocks,Where did you get 18.1B book value?  Their Q4 earnings report shows $10B in asset and $13B in liability.  Their book value should be -$3B.  Q1 is almost over and they probably lost close to another $1B in Q1 considering they lost about that amount in Q3 and Q4.  Their book value as of today should be close to -$4B.  Yahoo Finance shows their book value per share as -$12.86.
03/22/2021,stocks,"look it as an opportunity - you are in for the long haul I presume? buy a little bit every month. 

think about this  - yes they are bags now, but continual buying during this ""depressed"" period will result in larger gains in 3-5 years than if the stocks had remained at their ATH!"
03/22/2021,stocks,They usually have 1 person at the front for like 8-10 self check outs.

03/22/2021,stocks,Upon digging further i found 3%.
03/22/2021,stocks,Thank you for that this Monday mornin. Damn near had coffee coming out my nose
03/22/2021,stocks,"Looks like VUG is similar to QQQ, but VUG has a lower expense ratio and different composition for what looks like very similar top 10 holdings."

03/22/2021,stocks,/wsb is leaking. 10/10.
03/22/2021,stocks,"This isn't reasoning, it's just observing what has happened over the past few months"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Tbh about earnings reports. Lately, companies that have had good earnings reports stock always drops right when they come out and it makes no sense. Pretty sure that’s what happened with BB and NOK and there’s a few others this happened to but can’t remember specifically who it was"
03/22/2021,stocks,"The CRSR fans are choosing to conveniently ignore it, I guess. What they want to hear is that the company has great fundamentals, which--as we all know--has always resulted in the success of a stock, right?"
03/22/2021,stocks,I'm intrigued: are all stocks that have gone down since their all time high crappy?
03/22/2021,stocks,"Its not money I need to grow quickly, its money I'm hoping to hold for >1yr but I might need to take a few shares out if I need to. I have a few other volatile stocks but I dont think college money should be in a volatile stock, if I lost it all I'd be screwed"
03/22/2021,stocks,Thanks
03/22/2021,stocks,"Oh yeah i agree with you, that's why i'm trying to see if you can get a relatively consistent gain short term by picking a devent amount of stocks at random, if after a few months of running this experiment the results say otherwise i will not even try to do this and i will also not try to pick individual stocks because i know damn well that i am not qualified enough to analyse them on my own."
03/22/2021,stocks,Ah okay thank you
03/22/2021,stocks,Under appreciated comment right here.
03/22/2021,stocks,The Chinese people are awesome. I went to college with a large # of Chinese students and they were the kindest people. Their government is totally Orwellian.
03/22/2021,stocks,No problem
03/22/2021,stocks,"No problem with that, just tech bubble scares me. Bought them all first week February so kinda down on everything :/ but I'm fine for now"
03/22/2021,stocks,"True, but I did get my answers. So turns out if you make $1000 in short term gains, then make a bad investment and sell and end up with $700. If that is all within one year, you only pay taxes on $700, not $1000.

That was mainly what I was concerned about."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Ok thanks a lot. From another thread I posted in, it does sound like you actually need to pay money on your entire short term gains (and can end up in the negative). So I'll probably think about pulling out my money to just sit in a bank then for a while."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Enterprise value on the stats tab says 18.1B.  Is that not what that is?
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics?p=AMC

Although they list a price/book of 0.18 on the same page and dividing market cap by that would give 39B.  Seems self inconsistent."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yes long term, I am buying the “dips” when I can even if it gives me some anxiety, I agree that it will pay off eventually"
03/22/2021,stocks,"VUG is more diversified. It has things like Home Depot, MCD, Boeing, etc. Its less tech heavy than QQQ."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yeah, nice, sounds like you’ve got it figured out well enough to be fair"
03/22/2021,stocks,Hold for a year so you pay less gains tax
03/22/2021,stocks,"No problem man, good luck. Congrats on your gain and sorry to hear about your loss lol"
03/22/2021,stocks,Oh I see.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Well I didn't lose that much. Mostly hypothetical because I'm down on NIO, but not THAT much down. I'm afraid if Tesla tanks, NIO will follow suit. So yeah... probably more that I need to diversify."

03/22/2021,stocks,"With the upcoming earnings report on Tuesday, it’s safe to say that this week will be absolutely bananas for **GME**. So let’s look at some alternative data points on the most talked about stock right now.

&#x200B;

* First things first, GME is the most mentioned stock on Reddit and it’s not even close. Since January, GME has been mentioned an average of 10.000+ times per day on Reddit.
* Gamestop is also among the most mentioned stocks on the popular forum StockTwits with around 11.000+ mentions per day. Sentiment is high, 81% of all mentions are bullish.
* Gamestop gets around 1,000 new followers per day on Instagram. That is an impressive number, especially compared to their competitors.
* All mentions on social media have probably been one driving factor to the increase of website visitors. [Gamestop.com](http://gamestop.com/) attracted around 53 million visitors in February, up 30% since October last year.
* Gamestop’s mobile apps (where users can get personalized gaming news and buy games) are downloaded 250k times per month, up from around 210k a month ago. Decent growth. And users like the apps, the average review is 4.5 stars out of 5.
* Around 42k people are working for Gamestop and the company currently has 6,282 open job positions. This is a high number but it’s actually down from 6,672 in December and the number of total employees is also down by 3k in the last year. A growing company should have an increase in open positions month over month (if it’s not restructuring or pivoting) so this is a little bit of a red flag.
* The average employee review is pretty low (3.2 stars out of 5) and employees are complaining about Management and limited Career Opportunities.

Your thoughts on GME? All hype and betting against Wall St and/or a growing company?

03/22/2021,stocks,Okay. Thank you strawberry :)
03/22/2021,stocks,wtf is bitecoin
03/22/2021,stocks,This.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Someone in one of these subs mentioned they may look to offer shares/dilute in order to cap raise to eliminate debt. 

This would be a brilliant play by the board to get them out from under their billion dollar debt. 

Would tank the share price tho no?"
03/22/2021,stocks,Even if they announce good earnings the stock is extremely over priced currently and anyone not in the gme cult won’t be converted because of earnings.
03/22/2021,stocks,No problem hufflebuff
03/22/2021,stocks,"It would tank, but it's going to anger a ton of the shareholders in the board if they decide to issue more shares. They need to respond to the excessive shorting by recalling the shares"
03/22/2021,stocks,"It’s possible. But, their shareholders are the reason they’re seeing the most positive outlook in years. I doubt they’d want to make that move if it does tank the price. Who knows with this stock & situation, though 🤷🏻‍♂️"
03/22/2021,stocks,That’s what I said 👍😉
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yes I agree on the point about the recall

However I don’t think the board would be upset if they managed to wipe debt/recapitalize in order to fuel their growth agenda.

I mean, in theory, now is the best opportunity they may ever have to do this while there’s money and interest.  Buy low- sell high- right now the stock sentiment is likely at its highest in 2 decades?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"True. The retail love /frenzy put them on the radar— retail traders not going to revitalize the health of the company though.  Their time to strike as a company seems to be now- a cap raise would make sense for them to hit the reset button.

Just hope the bag holders get let down gently whatever happens. Seems so many of them are praying on this thing to miraculously hit “$1000” per share - I hope no one gets hurt when the house of cards crumbles"
03/22/2021,stocks,"The stock price doesn't matter unless you are trying to raise capital. So, your logic is circular. The board should absolutely take advantage of the high price to raise funds, which ironically may enable them to transition to an e-game platform and turn the company around for real."
03/22/2021,stocks,Has a company ever issued a recall? I imagine making market makers mad isn’t a great idea. You can’t solely rely on wsb to keep your company afloat.
2021-03-22 13:01:47,stocks,"Volkswagen Heats Up China EV Competition A joint venture between Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) and China’s state-owned First Automobile Works delivered its first electric sports utility vehicle — the SUV ID.4 Crozz — to 12 customers over the weekend in Shenzhen.

What Happened: The SUV,  available in five models, ranges in price between RMB 199,000 ($30,720) to RMB 279,900 ($43,000) after subsidies and has a range of between 400 KM (248 Miles) to 550 KM (342 Miles), CnEVPost reported.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Not sure I trust VW, one the electronics in their cars have had issues for decades, good engines bad electronics now they make electric car I'll wait on those results. Two after the diesel fiasco how much can we really trust them?"
03/22/2021,stocks,Considering the German big three are at least five years behind in battery tech says otherwise. Audi is just the premium brand for VW. They're all dumping billions to catch up because Tesla ate into their brands and they see the writing on the wall. Audis Etron is still an abysmal 230 miles after three years.
03/22/2021,stocks,">at least five years behind in battery tech

In what way? Tesla uses and has used LG and Panasonic batteries this entire time which are equally available to other OEs. Theres no secret sauce. Most of the range difference you see in tesla's marketing is due to them using the most generous EPA rating they can get away with whereas the other automakers are more conservative. The Germans straight up sand bag it"
03/22/2021,stocks,Five years behind in battery tech... tesla buys the batteries from the same companies as VW and the other ones do. Stop spreading this stupid fake narrative.
03/22/2021,stocks,"You sound open minded -  a friend has picked up the new Audi E-tron and I have to say the built quality and finish is infinitely better than the inside of any Tesla models I have been in. It's the attention to detail, some Tesla parts scuff each other, don't snuggly fit etc. 

Batteries may not be Tesla level yet but the finish of the car and attention to detail is far superior. 

The way I see it Tesla has to improve build quality or VW will catch up and continue to obliterate them on build quality."
03/22/2021,stocks,"
>five years behind in battery tech

Adopting battery tech that's 5 years newer.

Remember, Tesla doesn't enforce its patents.

*Nobody* can be behind Tesla in patented tech."
03/22/2021,stocks,VW isn't going to fudge a performance number ever again...
03/22/2021,stocks,"Tesla has to announce it's retooling everything with a focus on fit and finish to hope to keep pace with the tens of billions being spent by established, high-quality, high-volume car brands to drain its moat.

If it does, it could bottom out at an equal share of the market (with 5-10 competitors).

If it doesn't, it will be selling only to brand loyalists."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Surely batteries would just be a supplier issue, as far as i know Tesla has no crazy in-house technology that no one else has access to."
03/22/2021,stocks,I have the E-tron and I love it! Battery fucking blows though
03/22/2021,stocks,"Than why do they still sand bag every single one of their figures? Even the aventador svj was tested running better figures than advertised haha 

Are you getting defeat devices confused with claimed performance? Because very one was doing that and the epa didn't police it until VW decided to be the Lance Armstrong of the whole thing"
03/22/2021,stocks,*smacks ass* that’s right honey

(NYSE: XPEV) and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ: LI), more details have emerged.

What Happened: Nio is availing the services of Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley for assisting with its Hong Kong listing, an IFR report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Nio is reportedly looking to offload a 5% stake, valued at around $3.4 billion, in a secondary listing.

The valuation is calculated based on Friday's closing price of Nio's ADS listed on the NYSE.

The report further said Xpeng has hired Bank of America and JPMorgan and Li Auto is working with Goldman Sachs and UBS, for their respective Hong Kong listings.

I've been posting these every week over in [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) which some people actually enjoy so I thought this would be beneficial here for some of you. I'm SUPER LATE compared to when I usually post this, but below you'll find the watchlist notes for potential plays this week!

I usually do a livestream every Sunday and do the charting so people can watch and learn, but I couldn't do it yesterday. However, I had the Discord members send me their tickers so that I could chart them when I had time. Below is my technical analysis with targets for what they sent me. If you want to see the charts along with the notes included, you can view them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJv1GNXJzzn_kEoiZlRFGbL1e9GAFsrP?usp=sharing).

Last week was rough for everyone (although I'm sure everyone will agree that the Powell pump on Wed was AMAZING) so I hope this week is a lot better for you!

\-Davin

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Recap From Last Week’s Watchlist // Tickers = 6 // Targets Hit = 2 // Success Rate: 33%**

**$RIDE**\----No targets hit. Held the support we identified, but couldn’t fill the gap up to $18. Slowly bled off the rest of the week down to a low of $12.60

**$AQB**\----first target hit on Monday. It was $0.01 away from reaching our second target. Been choppy all week, but still holding above support line that it was resting on the prior Friday during AH

**$UBER**\----no targets hit. Highest it reached was $61.02 on Tuesday, but that was still $0.28 away from our first target. Fell all throughout Tuesday and Wednesday, stayed above 200 EMA on 4hr chart from Wednesday to Friday. Now back above 23.6% fib level so could be a potential play heading into this new week

**$AM**\----no targets hit. Uptrend support didn’t hold and slowly trended down throughout the week.

**$PLTR**\----no targets hit. First target was missed by $0.28 which was during premarket on Monday. PLTR took a doodoo throughout the rest of the week and hit a low of $23.39

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**\*\*** \- denotes the plays from the members that I really like and will be watching as well

**$FUBO:** seems to be holding support along the 61.8% fib level which is plotted as $29.55. If that holds and volume comes through we could see a gap fill up to $35.77. It’s holding support really well AND showing low volume the past two weeks, which is great to see if you’re wanting to go long because it shows strength even with decreased trading.

PT if $29.55 holds: $33 (conservative) > high $35’s

&#x200B;

**\*\*$SPCE:** Looking at the daily chart, I’m thinking it’ll fall down instead of head up, but we’ll have to see what happens during PM and Monday. If it can reclaim the downtrend resistance as support, then we can focus on the resistances as our targets. But, I’ll focus on the downside for now with how the chart is looking unless something shows me otherwise.

PT: $30 (low of prior trading day candles) > $28 (200 ema) > $24 (0% fib level from drawing on downtrend)

&#x200B;

**$TME:** Has earnings coming up later this morning, which is likely why it had a small run the past three trading days. Looks to have made new highs, so it’s a bit risky getting in now. I personally hate trading things when it’s at new highs until it starts consolidating and making new levels, but that’s not to say there’s no money to be made. I drew a fib extension to see what we’re dealing with and it looks like it already made it to the 100% extension level and is holding it as support on the 4hr. Hard to make a prediction where this could go ahead of earnings as I haven’t done any DD on the company, but I’ll give targets shown with the support/resistance levels below.

PT (upside): low $31’s > high $32’s

PT (downside): $30 > $29 > mid $28’s

&#x200B;

**\*\*NFLX:** Pretty much trading sideways the past two weeks. Hopefully that changes this week since the earnings report is coming up in about a month. Need to watch and wait to see if it breaks out of the consolidation it’s doing right now. More importantly, it needs to get above that $511 level and hold it as support to push up. If it fails that, we could see it drop towards the 200 EMA and uptrend support line, but I’m leaning more towards the upside due to earnings.

PT (upside): $516 > $530 > $542

&#x200B;

**\*\*$AMD:** Great looking chart as far as a buying opportunity goes. It’s near the key support level ($73.71) of the consolidation channel it’s been in since July of last year. Price is sitting on top of the 200 EMA on the daily chart as support, but if that gives we could see it falling to the uptrend support/key support in consolidation channel at what point I’d definitely want to take a position either shares or options a few weeks to a few months away.

PT (upside): high $81’s > high $84’s > $87 > $89

PT (downside): high $77’s > high $75’s > $74

&#x200B;

**\*\*$RBLX:** Bounced off the support at $67.17 and now trading real tight along the 200 EMA on the 4hr. Will need more trading time to see which way we’re heading because we’re also trading within a symmetrical triangle. Could break up towards resistance (which I’m leaning toward the most) or down towards support at which point I’d pay attention for a bounce.

PT (upside): $72 > $76

&#x200B;

**$AAPL:** Will be paying attention to this as we have a current call option in play, but looks to be heading up from support (both the uptrend and downtrend) which is great!

PT: mid $121’s > mid $122’s > $124 > $125

&#x200B;

**$SBBP:** Currently charting this as PM opened up and it took the hell off (LOL). If it holds this level at $4.63 we could see a gap fill to the high of PM of $5.46.

PT (upside): $5.46 > $6.33 > $6.82 > $7.00

&#x200B;

This DD will be dedicated to the long term growth potential of AMC and why I believe it is undervalued. As I was writing this, a lot has happened as such I will going through the mathematics and speculative valuation as well as in my opinion suspicious price action, as relevant to the long term potential of AMC currently; as well as try to reassure investors by clearing up a lot of the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) regarding the stock moving forward. All of this is my opinion, and my opinion alone of course, and not financial advice.

With that being stated; lets dive in:

This DD will be composed of the following sections:

i) Fundamentals

ii) Sentiment

iii) Momentum

iv) Consolidation

v) Future potential

vi) Bonus section: Connection to the Short Squeeze

\----FUNDAMENTALS----

So, let's begin with AMC's history:

AMC is a 100 year old company that is deeply embedded into American culture. Entertainment, movies and outings with friends and family has always been a top priority for people (globally). Making an investment into the nations largest theater chain is a bullish and potentially a highly profitable investment. Founded in the 1920s, out of Kansas, AMC offered its first IPO in the 80s which kick-started its growth to become Americas largest theater chain to this day. The price for AMC began to become undervalued in 2012, and as such sensing an opportunity Wanda ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda\_Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda_Group)) bought a majority stake in AMC, making Wanda the largest theater chain in the world. As such, AMC became a very stable company with a natural bullish outlook with major blue chip investors having large stakes in the company. Furthermore in 2016, Adam Aron was appointed the CEO in January and by May made moves to successfully acquire AMC's largest competitor Carmike Cinemas, successfully integrating it into the company and thereby cementing it at America's largest theater chain. In September of 2018, Silver Lakes Investments made a 600 mill investment into AMC, buying back approximately 32% of Wanda Group's class B common stock. Wanda continues to this day to hold the majority on the board of directors though. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC\_Theatres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres))

In October of 2019 AMC began its streaming service to compete with Netflix and co by starting to rent out films and even offering digital purchases via AMC Theatres On Demand. Just shortly after the premiere rumors of a new virus began to circulate in Wuhan in late November. The plague then hit America during February with the first cases, and by March the country was shut down and AMC had 0 in income coming from all theaters. Despite their core business grinding to a halt AMC raised almost over 2.2 billion dollars to my knowledge to date to stave off bankruptcy, as confirmed by the CEO ([http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/?co=AMC](http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/?co=AMC)).

Additional sources, documenting cash raising throughout the year are given below:

([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/30/amc-hopes-to-raise-125-million-in-fresh-funding-round-as-it-fights-bankruptcy.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/30/amc-hopes-to-raise-125-million-in-fresh-funding-round-as-it-fights-bankruptcy.html),

[https://deadline.com/2020/12/amc-entertainment-sell-200-million-shares-to-raise-cash-survive-covid-19-1234640183/](https://deadline.com/2020/12/amc-entertainment-sell-200-million-shares-to-raise-cash-survive-covid-19-1234640183/),

[https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-raises-cash-to-stave-off-bankruptcy-today-the-sun-is-shining-for-amc-ceo-1234679592/](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-raises-cash-to-stave-off-bankruptcy-today-the-sun-is-shining-for-amc-ceo-1234679592/))

AMC has completely avoided bankruptcy which should conclude its all-time low share price phase. Furthermore, it must be noted the CEO Adam Aron, has been quite skilled at handling crisis after crisis for AMC, whether its keeping AMC relevant despite pressure from streaming services or surviving a pandemic. The current CEO is a big part of why I believe AMC has immense growth potential. In addition to that the potential revenue from postponed blockbuster like Top Gun Maverick or Marvel movie releases from the beginning of 2020 up until now offers great potential for a post-covid recovery play. Even now relatively small releases such as Tom and Jerry see theatres filled to the legal capacity.

Due to my findings, I believe AMC has rock solid fundamentals of being profitable in addition to a time tested historical track record of being at minimum self sustaining regardless of negative historical events. Like America, it can bounce back from multiple crises better than before.

\-------SENTIMENT--------

At the time of writing, AMC has become a favorite of the average retail investor and the wallstreetbets ""movement"", as such the buying pressure on AMC is quite high; this can be seen from AMCs buy to sell ratio, which sits right now at 92:8. It usually fluctuates from 98:2 to 90:10 at any given time, depending on the volatility of the stock ([https://capital.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-cl-a-share-price](https://capital.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-cl-a-share-price)). Over the past two months, AMC shareholders refused to sell despite high volatility, which usually indicates strong belief in the fundamentals. Furthermore, institutional ownership has been skyrocketing with the quarterly inflow of this year being 98M compared to 1.51M in outflow ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/)).

Current public sentiment is that AMC is a sure-fire hit, just waiting for launch on both retail and institutional side with Vanguard and BlackRock being the most prominent recent investors. As traditional long-term investors, both companies likely believe that the stock is undervalued, making it an excellent time to take a stake for long-term value increase. ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/), [https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lxecfu/the\_institutional\_investors\_in\_both\_gme\_and\_amc/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lxecfu/the_institutional_investors_in_both_gme_and_amc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)).

The compounding effect of higher and higher prices contributes to the bullish sentiment supported by brokerages like fidelity which predict AMC could go up to 1.1k by September ([https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity\_algorithm\_predicting\_possibility\_of\_amc/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity_algorithm_predicting_possibility_of_amc/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)). The price momentum of a stock is defined by the sentiment and fundamentals of the company it represents. AMC has a combination of strong fundamental value with a strong Bullish sentiment. This is due to a high investment volume which grows day by day. During this pandemic, AMC's resiliency and successful battle to avoid bankruptcy encourages an extremely bullish price momentum. Evidence for this lies in the stock price increase from 5.50 to 14+ USD over a span of one month reflecting a price increase of 154%. Furthermore, reliable sources report a strong buy indicator and other competitors in the theatre industry have smaller market cap and market shares indicate a higher growth potential for AMC. Zachs for instance has rated it as a strong buy ([https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC), [https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC)).

\-----MOMENTUM-----

The price momentum of a stock is defined by the sentiment and fundamentals of the company it represents. AMC has a combination of strong fundamental value with a strong Bullish sentiment. This is due to a high investment volume which grows day by day. During this pandemic, AMC's resiliency and successful battle to avoid bankruptcy encourages an extremely bullish price momentum. Evidence for this lies in the stock price increase from 5.50 to 14+ USD over a span of one month reflecting a price increase of 154%. Furthermore, reliable sources report a strong buy indicator and other competitors in the theatre industry have smaller market cap and market shares indicate a higher growth potential for AMC. Zachs for instance has rated it as a strong buy ([https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-amc-moves-strong-170005657.html,https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC), [https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC)).

Furthermore if we look at AMC's competition like Cinemark [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNK/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNK/)), and Marcus ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCS/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCS/)), both of which are smaller companies by both market cap and market share, have a higher share price even if you account for the total amount of outstanding shares; thus indicating higher growth potential for AMC increasing the bullish momentum we've already seen.

As such to end this section off, I believe have proven that AMC's current share price is undervalued and if the projections of fidelity are to believed and the predicted share price is 1.1k+ with the current momentum and buying power ([https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity\_algorithm\_predicting\_possibility\_of\_amc/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m5v6ah/fidelity_algorithm_predicting_possibility_of_amc/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)), this stock is heavily undervalued, which has been reflected in the recent price action. I believe will continue to rise until the free market finds the correct price again, continuing the bullish momentum.

\-----CONSOLIDATION-----

I'd argue the most important part of a stocks price movement is consolidation. The price consolidation of a stock is defined by the share price effectively finding support at a price point, where in which the price of the stock doesn't easily fall under for a certain period of time. The longer the floor lasts, the stronger the consolidation is generally speaking. In contrast a quick consolidation may indicate a bull run with the price dropping back down afterwards. Quick is of course relative to the volatility of the stock in question, with AMC being one of the most volatile of stocks over the last couple of months a steady increase in share price over the last couple of months could be considered a slow consolidation.

As the definition for consolidation has been established now, lets apply it to the price action for AMC. Using the last 3 sections of fundamentals, momentum and sentiment we can establish that AMC is currently looking for it's ""fair value"" on the stock market. The more consolidation occurs at higher and higher prices, the quicker the share price will rise and find new floors, as the free market tries to find the price for the stock and in my personal opinion it's not stopping anytime soon.

Furthermore, as more retail investors buy the stock, price volatility and volume will increase. With higher volume comes price consolidation which in turn increases the stock price over time. This increasing level of support also directly affects options as more options will expire in the money with each new price consolidation floor. With this additional buying pressure comes volatility that drives the price up, causing more options to expire in the money, shooting the price to new heights. This process will repeat in a positive feedback loop, until the free market/shareholders determines the price of the stock to be fairly valued.

Several companies experienced the same phenomenon like Tesla, Volkswagen and now AMC is currently in the middle of a comparable aggressive price growth feedback cycle.

\-----FUTURE POTENTIAL-----

Now lets cover the rumors of AMC being acquired by either Amazon, or Netflix ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Amazon-netflix-try-acquire-amc-120436878.html?guccounter=1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Amazon-netflix-try-acquire-amc-120436878.html?guccounter=1), [https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/06/16408055/will-Amazon-or-netflix-buy-a-movie-theater-chain](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/06/16408055/will-Amazon-or-netflix-buy-a-movie-theater-chain)). Lets start with Netflix:

A Netflix acquisition would be different in my opinion from Amazon. Netflix would turn into an extension of its movie network. Netflix has several storylines in development such as ""The Witcher"", ""The dark crystal: Age of resistance"", and ""the The Queen’s Gambit"" have quite high expectations; a more exhaustive list can be seen here: [https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/best-on-netflix/best-tv-on-netflix/#12-the-queen-s-gambit](https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/best-on-netflix/best-tv-on-netflix/#12-the-queen-s-gambit).

Additionally, Netflix has multiple storylines in development such as Bombay Rose, Dealer, multiple Kdrama's, Get the Goat and other storylines ([https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/netflix-original-series-movies-tv-shows-coming-in-2021](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/netflix-original-series-movies-tv-shows-coming-in-2021), [https://www.buzzfeed.com/emlyntravis/best-k-dramas-tv-shows-movies-on-netflix](https://www.buzzfeed.com/emlyntravis/best-k-dramas-tv-shows-movies-on-netflix)) which will affect Netflix's market value in a positive manner.

Now, that the value of Netflix has been established, I'd like to run a thought experiment regarding the value of Netflix if it acquires AMC, and how the value of Netflix would increase and how if a retail investor (this is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, just a speculative case study) took a position in AMC currently at its undervalued state, how the retail investor could have the value of his/her position increase overtime in the event of a Netflix acquisition.

Netflix's valuation will increase if they had the largest American cinema chain on top of their entertainment production business. This provides a bigger platform for their entertainment to not only a larger audience, but also adding value to their existing customer base. This in turn, increases the position value of their shareholders. As such, in the case where AMC is acquired by Netflix, I believe the value of the positions in AMC/NFLX will increase. In the context of this thought experiment, as such the result of this thought experiment would be that AMC is currently undervalued in this hypothetical scenario. The value addition to AMC would handsomely reward AMC shareholders and thus would be a good investment (This is not financial advice).

Secondly, let's address the other scenario of acquisition, the Amazon deal. My understanding, many of Amazon's institutional buyers have bought into this; I'll post the source for verification: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/). As such rumors on an Amazon acquisition are not unfounded. I believe this deal will be similar to the deal with ""Whole Foods Market"" ([https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/15/a-year-after-Amazon-announced-whole-foods-deal-heres-where-we-stand.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/15/a-year-after-Amazon-announced-whole-foods-deal-heres-where-we-stand.html)), and AMC will become a part of the Amazon ecosystem, with Amazon Prime members having value added to their existing plans. As we've seen with Whole Foods, prior to the acquisition,

Whole Foods Market was receding in a bad market position, losing market share left and right to competitors. However, after the deal with Amazon, Whole Foods Market went through a mini-financial revolution where it was able to re-acquire its original market share. This was done by Whole Foods Market getting access to 2 things Amazon brought to the table: its internet infrastructure and its customer base, as well as immense liquidity of Amazon. This allowed Whole Foods Market to quickly gain back market share; as well as innovate their business. This was done by utilizing Amazon's platforms to increase cost effectiveness. In relation to their business model they increased profits, which allowed them to expand their business, and take back market share at the expense of their competitors. Furthermore, this allowed Whole Foods Market to go from a regional distributor of organic produce to a national grocery chain specializing in organic foods.

This was done, in my opinion, by utilizing Amazon's data-centric business model. Whole Foods Market was quickly able to identify market inefficiencies and use them to gain back market share, while increasing value provided to the customer. This was accomplished through innovation and new business practices, such as faster and more centralized delivery, data intensive business planning, etc. Lastly, Whole Foods Market was able to prove there was a market place for organic fresh foods within an extremely competitive market environment by effectively using the Amazon playbook in the grocery space. In doing so, they took back their market share at the expense of profit.

I believe if AMC were to be acquired by Amazon, it would be a comparable play from there on; i.e. the gaining of market share at the expense of their competitors. They would be introducing new business methods to add value to their customers and shareholders using big data. This can be done in several ways: Amazon may utilize the Netflix model as previously proposed. This can be done by simply substituting Netflix production, development and licensed storylines model with an Amazon Prime one. Amazon Prime has original shows like ""The Expanse"" as well, as well as licensed, developing content like ""Vinland Saga"", ""Attack on Titan"" and ""The Boys"". Sources for Prime video shows are as follows:

i) [https://reelgood.com/tv/source/Amazon](https://reelgood.com/tv/source/Amazon)

ii) [https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-Amazon-prime-original-series-ranked](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-Amazon-prime-original-series-ranked)

iii) [https://decider.com/article/new-on-Amazon-prime/](https://decider.com/article/new-on-Amazon-prime/)

Furthermore, as shown with Whole Foods Market, Amazon likes to integrate new acquisition into its ecosystem. In addition to the Netflix replacement deal, AMC customers will be offered further value that will enhance AMC's products such as family and friend bonding time as well as entertainment. This could be done in several ways, in addition to Amazon 5 star restaurants being set up within the cinemas, additional merchandizing rights, prime member discounts, centralization of merchandize and concession stands resulting in, I dare say, cheaper popcorn perhaps; the possibilities for growth are endless. As such, the Amazon scenario can, and I believe, have as much growth potential as the Netflix scenario.

The third scenario; is AMC rebuilding itself to compete with streaming services and offer a better service to its customers. This is also another profitable scenario. Right now AMC is the largest cinema chain in the country; with multiple accredited investors like BlackRock and Vanguard. Furthermore, they have 2.2 Billion cash as stated above; as such they have the ability to innovate without incurring debt. They also have a highly supportive shareholder and customer base, which means there will be strong and perpetual buying pressure. An increase in interest allows them to raise further capital as time progresses as the need arises for innovations. These innovations could be exploring Virtual Reality, or going with a hybrid formula similar to both Amazon's and Netflix's plan is completely up to AMC's shareholders and AMC's board of directors.

However, the purpose of this section was to show how AMC is not just a meme stock (it is, but it also in my opinion an undervalued stock, allowing potential buyers to generate value in their positions, at the current ask price); but an excellent long term hold. As such, I'd like to end this section by saying the following:

Throughout this section I explored the future growth potential of AMC; as such I believe whether it's acquired by a larger company, or forges its future itself, the stock is highly undervalued. The value of this stock will be not determined by any narratives; but by shareholders of AMC, as well as the business itself as it continues to generate revenue for its customers and shareholders.

\----Connection to the Short Squeeze----

This topic is unavoidable; as such I believe it should be addressed head on. As stated in the beginning of this article, this article has been dedicated to discussing the long-term growth prospects of AMC, and why I believe it has immense growth potential. This has been directly shown using mathematics, price and sentiment analysis, why this stock should grow naturally regardless of a short squeeze (to an extremely high price too according to fidelity). As such, this article is to help people who may be doubting their investment in AMC, due to all the fear, uncertainty and doubt regarding the stock; as such this article presents a long-term outlook on the hypothetical price action of AMC regardless of the squeeze.

Thus, hopefully, allows people to sleep better at night if they are holding AMC.

Now, lets talk about the squeeze that I know many of you may have on your minds; I stand by my words written here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m07hnz/the\_inevitability\_of\_amc\_2k\_based\_on\_current/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/m07hnz/the_inevitability_of_amc_2k_based_on_current/), I still believe the price floor for AMC being 2k, especially after the last 2 week's suspicious price actions. To say the least, we have cemented the floor more than ever (plus I said there will be massive FUD from AMC shorters and the Media going forward; one that comes to mind is Motley Fool for instance). However, I'm starting to lean towards the fact that the price floor must be much higher, due to this stock being manipulated at a higher rate (similar to synthetic CDO's back in 07/08 when the housing market exploded). This is still being researched, but I'll leave you guys with a couple sources in relation to GME;

Comments on GME trading halt and the hypothetical price if it wasn't halted:

Here's some proof that GME did almost hit 10k right before trading halts:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m858f7/amc\_robinhood\_hodlers\_you\_must\_turn\_off\_instant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m858f7/amc_robinhood_hodlers_you_must_turn_off_instant/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m383nu/short\_mr\_on\_amc\_200\_in\_questrade/](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/m383nu/short_mr_on_amc_200_in_questrade/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l6y5rq/did\_we\_break\_gme\_9999\_on\_the\_ask\_and\_frozen\_on\_td/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l6y5rq/did_we_break_gme_9999_on_the_ask_and_frozen_on_td/reddit)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6yas1/gme\_bidask\_hits\_limit\_in\_tda\_2509999/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6yas1/gme_bidask_hits_limit_in_tda_2509999/)

Now within those links it shows that the margin requirement to short AMC is 200%, and GME was only at 120%; just based on the math, AMC can match if not exceed GME's initial non-halted squeeze of roughly 10k. However, I'm still working out all the math if 10k AMC is viable (I'm leaning to a yes so far though, but I'll keep you guys posted). So I'll be conservative and put the floor at 5k for now upon initial observations. Now, there still must be a lot of math to be worked out guys, so don't take it as straight facts. This is just initial speculation, but I believe the floor may be much higher in the case of a short squeeze at $5k ish. In addition, Fidelity's charts agree long-term this could be a $1.1k+ stock. So it's more than mathematically viable, as I have demonstrated in this article.

\-----Summation----

So to wrap it all up in a pretty bow, I believe the fundamentals, sentiment, momentum, consolidation and future potential of AMC, make it a very strong buy in my opinion.

This has not only been reflected by recent price action and an increase in buy volume, but also accompanied by main street sentiment towards AMC.

I believe this will continue until shareholders determine the value of AMC; thus satisfying the free markets quest to find the true price.

Finally, as customary within my articles, I'd like to leave an appropriate quote or two to summarize the article. Since this article is dedicated to the long-term price action and value of AMC, let's take today's quotes from the ancient past:

""Good character is not formed in a week or a month. It is created little by little, day by day. Protracted and patient effort is needed""- Heraclitus of Ephesus.

""It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light"" - Aristotle.

As the wise men of the past have indicated, value is not created over night, it takes patient and protracted effort to create and reward value, however the fruit of the labor is usually sweet; so I believe whenever the price is found for AMC, the shareholders will be rewarded by their patience and effort with sweet profit.

Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts on the price action of AMC, and its future prospects. I hope the rest of your day goes well and you are successful in your endeavors.

This of course is solely my opinion, and not financial advice.

\---TLDR---

For people who don't feel like reading, and apes; the article shows long-term you'll get profit/tendies of a price floor according to Fidelity of $1k+ minimum long-term, as such, if you continue to buy and hold; mathematically you will not only reach tendieland (high profit for those who don't speak wsb), but your tendies (profits) will be nice and crisp."
03/22/2021,stocks,"When you say Fidelity, you mean an ass hat with a Fidelity account?  And you believe the price floor for a company currently at 14 dollars a share is 2000?  Is this satire?

For those looking to get into AMC as a value play I will just remind you, that AMC's value before a Pandemic destroyed it's business, and forced it to take on a mountain of debt, was roughly 750 million dollars. 

It's market cap is currently 7 billion, ten times it's prepandemic market cap.   Anyone telling you AMC is a value play is a conman, end of story."
03/22/2021,stocks,"At $1000, AMC would be valued around $450billion. People really believe that AMC is worth more than Wal-Mart and Disney? Or are we just throwing numbers around and calling it due diligence?

The reality with AMC and GME is that there is no due diligence to be done. They are gambling stocks and that's fine if you want to gamble with your money. But don't do that and pretend that there is actual due diligence behind it."
03/22/2021,stocks,"There is no long term play on AMC, GME or whatever meme comes next. Don't let anyone fool you"

03/22/2021,stocks,Plus share dilution. Like 3x the amount of shares now than in 2019. Their balance sheet is a joke.
03/22/2021,stocks,Disagree on GME. Its trading too high right now. But in the future it could have a similar market cap to Chewy. That would be it a $500 a share. Its not close enough to pulling it off that it justifies its current price. But it could get there and will be a good buy when it comes back to earth.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Heck, sold mine today due to my feeling of incompetence in the company. I’ll take my tendies to richer waters. If your banking on AMC or GME your a gambler. Fine by me, gotta know when to hold em, know when to fold em."
03/22/2021,stocks,"What exactly are you implying?  This is literally the most bullshit, DD I have ever read.  If you can't see this with your own eyes I don't really even know how to react to that with anything other than pity."
03/22/2021,stocks,Have you realised 10000$ or are you sitting on it waiting to be murdered in the premarket like back in February the 2nd? These stocks are known to drop over 50% before the market even opens so dont be surprised to see this 10000$ turn into an actual loss if you dont sell soon.
03/22/2021,stocks,"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC?p=AMC

This is where I got it, not sure what accounts for the difference."
03/22/2021,stocks,You don't add share dilution to market cap. Market cap accounts for share dilution. ie their market cap probably rose because of the issuance of new shares.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Seriously please explain to me how a fairly small brick and mortar company is worth over 100 times what it was pre-pandemic? There’s no way GMA stays where it is now let alone sit at $500, everything we’ve seen has been artificial."

03/22/2021,stocks,I’m not worried. They can go up just as quickly.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Interesting. It doesn't give me confidence that two major financial websites could have such wildly different figures.

EDIT: macrotrends.net and barchart.com have $3B, Yahoo has $6.34B, and Marketwatch, Bloomberg, & Nasdaq.com all have $6.27B. So the $6.27B is most likely accurate, but I guess I'm going to have to start checking multiple websites from now on. You can't trust anything apparently."
03/22/2021,stocks,"No, but a company that’s borderline insolvent that’s issued 3x shares outstanding is a big red flag. 

A non-meme stock would be in the toilet if they had all that debt added while simultaneously issuing a ton of shares"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Its has more assets than debt. Its slowly acquiring the team that built Chewy from nothing. That same team could possibly build Gamestop from where it is now, into an online retailer the size of Chewy.      
&nbsp;    
Obviously there is no guarantee they pull it off again. Obviously it will take years if they do it. Obviously GME isn't worth its current price. But its definitely worth having GME on your radar after it crashes. If it goes to 20-30ish I think its a good hi risk play."
03/22/2021,stocks,They have completely different floats according to multiple sites.  Weird...
03/22/2021,stocks,"Since market cap is constantly changing, the best way to do it is calculate it yourself.

It's down 15% today - the market cap as of this moment is \~$5.3b"
03/22/2021,stocks,Not trying to say this justifies OPs absurd price target but didn't they pay off all of their debt with their share dilution?
03/22/2021,stocks,Sure I’d take a gamble at 20-30 same as I gambled on AMC at $2.80.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Well, same problem if different sites are giving different figures for the amount of shares outstanding."

03/22/2021,stocks,"I sold half of a highly volatile mutual fund after watching 30 or 40k disappear. I didn't have an emergency fund of more than 10k so i rotated 30k out of the market into cash in case i needed a bigger buffer. I kept putting paychecks into the market afterwards, but in lower yield funds. Still made a ton of money, but not as much as i would have if i stayed  in the volatile fund which was up 100% from the bottom of 3/2020. 

The 30k is still in cash because the wife wanted a bigger emergency fund. Not a big deal, it offers peace of mind."

I bet a lot of people sold during the drop in hopes of getting back in even lower. 

Some might‘ve been so far in the green that they still got out way above their entry and preferred the safe profit instead of the uncertainty. 

Maybe others wanted to redistribute their money in light of the new situation. 

I‘m pretty sure a lot of really bad sells were unlimited stop losses set by people who don’t fully understand them.

03/22/2021,stocks,"That is an excellent question.  Why do we sell when things start heading south?  Cut our loses?   And your right, in order for a crash to occur, we need sellers.  I'm retired and have been investing all my life.  I'll answer your question with another question.  Why didn't you buy?  I've learned through years of losing money in order to make money you play the opposite way you think the market is going to go.  Look back in 2008/9.   That's when I turned things around and started buying on the dips.  Listen, if you've invested long enough you know what goes down will go back up.   Take a look back at March 23 or so.  I don't care what stock.  Now look at the stock price now.  I bet you a dime to a dollar 99% of the stocks went up.  Hell, look at the DOW and S&P.   My opinion and my opinion only.   If you have a portfolio that you believe in and things start going south, hang on if you can, buy more if you like the stock.  Don't sell, you'll regret it in a couple months when you look and it doubled."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Because the last pandemic of this size lasted for years and we didn't know if 100 million people were going to die or 1 million.

I also, as a novice investor, didn't quite fully understand that the government can print money and that will justify a stock price increase in companies that literally cannot make any money. I mean how many people learned that in econ class? When earnings are 0 and government money is unlimited that allows a P/E ratio of unlimited. 

And unfortunately, we still didn't know how long this was going to last when the market began to rebound. The market was up 30-40% and thousands were dying and hospitals overran. 

It helps to be a hedge fund and talk to other hedge funds and with the combined buying power of your hedge fund and the 10 other hedge funds you interact with, to have enough buying power to move the market."

I had actually taken out some profits in early March - so I got lucky there. But we did not know how things would play out so I had to sell some of my longest term holdings to have a renovation fund available. Probably lost out on 50k worth of gains if I would have left it alone - but man -  I was able to sleep at night knowing I could finish the renovation without having to take out a loan (lots of factors here including the fact that my wife gave birth in April -  so lots of stress at the time).
03/22/2021,stocks,"Frankly, I sold the drop because there was opportunity to ride it on the way down. Puts on Telsa, calls on SQQQ. Rarely do I think that there are sure things in the market but Covid was SUCH an unknown, U.S. leadership was extremely poor at the time, and Tesla had just had a meteoric rise of 100% in like a week in early 2020. All of this made for a perfect storm of a 'sure thing' that the market would have a steep, sustained drop off that we wont see again for a long time. 

These things made me sell my positions, buy a put on tesla and calls on SQQQ because it was one of the few sure things I've invested in in my life."

03/22/2021,stocks,"I heard a very interesting story about why people sell during crashes the other day:

It's basic human psychology. When we get into trouble, our instinctual response is either fight or flight. You can't fight a crashing market, so the only natural response left is flight.

You can train yourself to ignore this urge, much like a soldier can train to remain calm during combat, but it takes some effort. More for some than others."

I’ve been reading about Avalara being a market disruptor, because it automates tax compliance which will mean “every company will eventually purchase the software to avoid being audited for incorrect taxes”. Stephen McBride even claims owning this stock will mean getting a fraction of EVERY INTERNET TRANSACTION ONLINE, being the “Amazon Killer tollbooth stock”. But also that Amazon themselves will use Alavara’s “Amazon Killer” themselves. The sense on this is kind of blurry. Why would a company use something threatening to put them out of business?

Tesla is predicted to hit $3,000 a share by 2025 (at least Cathie Wood believes it will).

I like Tesla. Tesla is already well established and growing. Electric power, cleaner than gasoline (sorry you Keystone workers lost your jobs though, I don’t think it should have been shut down so suddenly, not at all) and self driving cars, which I REALLY SUPPORT (TONS of car accidents where I live, and pretty much everyone is on their phone while driving EVERYWHERE).

Technology may have done a lot of damage to humanity (but also lots of good) but I think the solution is to advance it EVEN MORE, not eliminate it (which would never happen as it’d massively disrupt almost everyone’s life and crumble every business. This will only happen in the event of some MASSIVELY SEVERE cyberattack).

So I personally support a lot of advances in technology, science, AI (yes that’s technology). 

But I can’t afford as much of these already big companies stocks.

I missed out on any massive life changing gains from GME. I don’t expect to get rich quick. I don’t know what I’ll do in between now and having massive returns however many years, or decades from now, but a stock exploding sooner than later is obviously possible.

I’m not thinking about RETIREMENT. That brings me great pain, because I’m 25 and haven’t done much, and now terrified of missing out on the rest of my 20s, 30s, and just the rest of life. But, as GME showed, sometimes rockets suddenly take off (I’m holding some GME, I’m actually still in the green even after missing A SECOND CHANCE to buy at a deep dip. But I’m holding for Ryan Cohen’s reimagining of the GameStop company. Any Tweet may even send the stock soaring any moment, as we’ve seen.

It’d be cool to get to actually work in the tech industry, but I’ve never been that smart, and now I’m just so completely directionless and dependent on meds that I may not even be able to afford next year after turning 26 and falling off of my parents health insurance. 

I have a very low paying very low skill job that makes me feel worse about myself, but I haven’t quit because I haven’t been fired and I’m afraid of getting another job and being let go and then having no job.

My whole life has been a waste. I just want to have my own life, be independent, I’m tired of being dependent on my parents, and dependent on garbage jobs that even fulltime don’t pay a basic living wage.

I just want to be free from my family and their life decisions. 

I actually thought about taking the money back out of my brokerage account (Fidelity) and just putting it back into my savings. This is my stimulus plus tax return money, a little over $2,300, but I’ve already taken about $3,000 from my savings account IN ADDITION TO THAT (down from 10K to 7K).

My money wasn’t growing for me sitting in a saving account, and I feel stuck in life, directionless, running out of time before severe financial and medical consequences because of my age.

Investing is GOOD, it’s just more likely to payoff in the long run. GME was like, a glitch in the matrix, and the mods already patched it. 

I just don’t know what the hell I can do with my life from now (25). I don’t want to just be miserable and lonely until I’m old (if I even survive that long).

I don’t care about being rich as much as finding something that makes me happy, acceptance, relationships, but hitting rich would mean SECURITY AND INDEPENDENCE. Free from being dependent on any employer, protected against inflation and economic crashes/collapse.

I certainly can’t enjoy life if I’m always broke, or, homeless. Or working 70-80 hours a week? 40 feels like a lot as is. 70-80? I’d legitimately rather die.

My entire life has been screwed up, now the stock market is like a possible light at the end of the tunnel, but it could be a long tunnel.

I don’t know what else to say now."

If you were going to spend $120 on Tesla you would have gotten a 1/5 of a share and instead now you're going to get 2 shares for 1/10th the price per share. Either way, you're still buying the same amount of Tesla. 

That's why they do it, the psychology of the small investor makes them feel like they're getting more for their money and they start to pile in. You shouldn't get hung up on that."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Don't diversify with just 2k, that's a joke. You mentioned you're only just starting out, so put the money in a company you really understand. Which is probably not more than 2 companies. After just a few weeks/months."

03/22/2021,stocks,The right track is expecting life to be miserable until I’m old and have big returns?
03/22/2021,stocks,"Haha sorry, not what I meant. I meant that you're aware that you need to focus long term and not worry about what happens today or tomorrow. Don't worry about having to sell a stock unless something fundamentally has changed about their business or the stock has reached the price you bought in for and you don't believe the stock can keep climb much from here.

If you focus on the long term, every day doesn't have to be a battle. It'll become like brushing your teeth; some days it sucks but most of the time you just kinda do it without thinking about it. I started a year ago and I've already seen days where I was 5k in the red (which is a lot of money for me) and I don't even think about it anymore. It affects me as much as paying for an apple."

For this reason,  most people who are setting up automatic investments will choose a mutual fund from the brokerage where they are investing.  The minor increased fee is overcome by the advantages of regular investments.

I tend to use etfs in my taxable accounts and mutual funds in the work ira.  I also have a traditional ira which I hold a mix."

2021-03-22 09:13:05,stocks,"Apple holder for 15 years now, here’s why it wasn’t easy. Always read if you bought Apple 10 years ago at xxxx it would be worth xxxx today. People assume it was luck or smart to buy then and easy hold with how the solid company is.

I read thousands of articles over the years saying Apple peaked, Android has caught up, techs dated, price to high, sales down...you name it. Holding long is hard is the point, no matter the company. Whether it’s negative press, stock down or stagnant too.

Apple brand is why I held, they withstood some bad years with making non innovative products due to loyalty and branding product so well.

And that’s why I’m also long on Tesla, Netflix, peloton....over valued or not. The company to perfect a product first and build a following is tough to over throw, if they stay innovative."

When Apple was 650B, equal to what Tesla is right now; they were extremely profitable not barely like Tesla.  Also, it was around this time they started paying the dividend and Berkshire went in.

Around that time Apple was mis-categorized as a hardware and a cyclical company. There was an analyst who recommended a short sell at 95! He, like many others felt that iPhone sales had peaked and Apple's best days were behind it. I bought Apple believing that it should be valued much higher than good consumer staples with little or no growth like Coke and P&G -- at above 20 times earnings; Instead, Apple was  getting sold at 10 to 12 times after having grown revenues 15 fold in the last 10 years! I believed that the future growth would come from services and wearables.

It took a Warren Buffett to get Apple to its rightful multiple and valuation……I don’t expect Apple to fall below 25X earnings in the future. It’s in the sweet spot of being a stalwart, consumer staple with growth from at least two segments – services and wearables.

To me, Apple’s greatest strength is its integration of hardware and software, it’s really a system on chips from start to finish – completely integrated and the best product in all its categories, which allows it to increase prices and have the best margins in the industry, and throw up gobs of cash!

Apple’s best days are ahead of it."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Peloton, IMO is a stupid bet - they aren't unique in any way and that is why, they are catering to a small market who is rich and will be irrelevant within a couple of years because there is nothing proprietary to what they sell. 

They didn't create anything unique.... the software isn't unique, literally - nothing is unique. When you look at Tesla, Netflix and Apple - they are game changers. Peloton doesn't embody that.

After diving into this post and the comments - it seems this is heavily based on luck and people who didn't know what they were doing or didn't put in the research to see what was coming. We live in a data / information driven age now and we are able to see trends and where money is going to be pushed / circulating.

There was nothing I could do but put my money where my mouth was and buy a few shares with money I'd saved up. A full 10% of the money I had to spend went to the brokerage fees, ouch. But I held, and now I'm selling some off just because it's the majority of my portfolio and I ought to diversify a bit (I have other investments, it has just overtaken them all). Similar deal with Tesla a while back. I blocked Seeking Alpha because all the headlines I was getting were ""Tesla is overvalued"", ""Here comes the next Tesla killer"", etc, it was like they were out to get them. I didn't own any shares (felt like I missed the boat), but when I saw a headline that said ""Tesla at lowest price in 3 years"", I couldn't pass it up. It's now worth like 10x and I'm kicking myself for not buying more (I know, you can't). Point is, I believed in them and what they were doing, and the headlines were all downers, and I plan to hold for years to come. Trading is fun but sometimes you just gotta hold."

With the plaid + you get way more for your money across many different metrics. Also how many people buying it are going to be racing around a track? How many Taycan is porche making every year? Nothing compared to Tesla. Even at that crazy price they still wont be profitable for many years to come if they try to become competitive price wise. Anybody chosingba Taycan over a Tesla is just throwing away money for a lesser product.

03/22/2021,stocks,"The fortitude to hold thru highs and lows when you are convinced of a company value deserves some praise.

But seems you are discounting the fact you also got lucky, both with timing and ticket choice. Suggesting that valutation doesn’t matter is wrong, and being the first to perfect a product is no guarantee of continued successs.

Let’s talk about valutation and timing:

You held Apple during a great bull market, when many lots of companies did great.
What if you bought tech at the height of the .com bubble? It may have taken ten years to recover your investment, and many stocks would still be at a loss after 20.
So you want to avoid buying at such a peak. How to do it? That crash came following crazy valutations. Valutations do matter a lot, especially for a long term investor.

Buffett always looks to buy at a discount on fair value, to have a margin of safety. A company can be both an amazing business and a terrible investment, if you pay too much.
The market has been defined a voting machine on the short term and a weighting one on the long. That’s why if you plan to hold long term you should be especially concerned about value.
Holding long doesn’t justify paying too much, it’s the opposite. You can pay too much if you are holding short term and taking advantage of a trend.
Overpaying to hold long term, you are betting that the market will stay irrational until your company eventually grows into its inflated price. Success depends on two conditions both being true, adding to risk.

Which brings to stock choice. Optimism on the long term future of a business is often misplaced.

Cisco in the 2000s was considered a guaranteed winner of the internet revolution. Network equipment, powering the internet! It looked like Tesla does today, at the top of a new and exciting world change.
21 years later, Cisco’s price is still down roughy a third from its peak. History is full of such falls from grace. Beware of survivor bias.

>	The company to perfect a product first and build a following is tough to over throw, if they stay innovative

Such a big and unguaranteed IF, given as an aside, feels like intellectual cheating. How can you be sure that they will remain innovative in the right ways (and execute well, as importantly)? It’s a huge question mark.
You point to Apple, I point to the leaders before it, Nokia and Blackberry. Who would have guessed at their peak that they would have “stopped to innovate”?

Look at your new picks, three out of four you mentioned are memes.
Peloton for example, it isn’t comparable to Apple. There is an element of prestige in owning a brand phone or car, because they are items you use in public. Not so much an indoor bike.
What stops anyone else to offer a comparable product at better price? Nothing.
You think they will succeed long term because of brand loyalty? Here is a funny scenario: what happens if Apple starts selling an exercise bike, integrated with FaceTime and updated social connectivity for iPhone users? Where will the “cool” Peloton users go?
What happens when people go back to the gym? Peloton targets wealthy users who can afford top gyms with a pleasant ambience, which offer a superior experience to home training. Being close to lots of real people working hard has a pumping effect in itself, it’s more fun and gets the adrenaline flowing, you feed on each other’s energy."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Just to be clear to all the people thinking they will just buy and hold Apple, which I see and hear a lot of still, don't. This is not going to repeat itself. Doubling on Apple literally requires its value to increase by multiple -trillions- of dollars. Has Apple peaked? Probably not. It will show steady and slow intermittent growth for years to come. But it definitely does not have the potential to grow that a lot of other companies do."

Didn’t spend much, maybe 300 bucks between the 2(enough to get me 19 shares, 6 VW and 13 Porsche). It was just nice knowing I was part owner of car brands I have always loved and respected. However given the press lately I am looking at adding to both positions(Porsche owns 53% of VW) and seeing where we are in 10 or 15 years."
03/22/2021,stocks,"There would definitely had been some tempting times to sell Apple. But apart from the moment Apple starting selling iPhones in 2007/8 and this past year, its PE has never been above 18 and its always had huge cash reserves. You never had to hold at a triple digit PE like you do with those other companies you listed. It seems like they're quite different situations. Imagine if Apple traded at a 70 PE in 2015 (which would make it worth the same as today but without the earnings to support it) and you held...you'd have 0% return for 6 years."

Boy was that a good investment.  I will admit I didn't realize the spike was happening (I tend not to closely monitor individual stocks).  When I realized how high my tesla had gone I started selling a bit to lock in some gains only to have it drop a bunch recently.  Now I'm sitting on it waiting (hoping) for it to recover so I can lock in more gains."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Agreed.  New investors don't get this.

I think looking at ones stocks to much can be partly the issue.  Makes person act emotionally -- which surprising most investors are.

Not that is should make a difference, but dollar amount and not a percentage also makes people more jumpy.  Example:  5% of 1,000.  vs. a 5% move on 1,000,000 :)  Logical it should not make difference to a person, but physiologically it a whole different story.

News and sentiment drives people choices.  I also think the large fish purposely love to generate volatility and for that exact reason.   They feed of the small ""insecure"" fish, people think stop losses are ""good"", when in realty those can murder you if set them to tightly.  I tend to not use them.  Netflix when they dropped heavily when they wanted to rename and spin off DVD way back, that crap was nuts ... wild & ""suspicious"" ride that was.  But its a good example of the physiological ride, the correct thing would have been to add 2/3 on the way down, then another 1/3 where one guess the bottom was.  But the realty was the brave held  for dear life (not daring to buy a single addition point), and the majority just dumped out of panic and never bough back.   Then after it rocked the ""brave"" that had held and never added when seeing 40% profit sold their positions (after that ride, 40% looks pretty great) .. and only the very, very rare trader help and did the 2/3, 1/3 adding to their positions ... and again the hedgies make their millions/billion and murder the small fish.  It has been this way since black Friday.  Nothing new.

So yea, to hold a stock it really ... really hard IMO and not as easy as people think.  They look at chart history and think it was an ""easy"" ride ... when it never is.

I favor larger cap companies with good track records, but even large companies can go belly up ... and I think infinitely holding a stock can be dangerous too.  The good think about large can is they much harder for hedgies to generate artificial volatility.

At the end of the day, investing is a physiological game mostly with yourself IMO ... with no easy answers.

I have been trading on and off since before .com crash, 9/11 ... that crap was nuts.  Then came house market crash and the more resent Armageddon ""we all gonna die"" of covid crap.  Even Buffet made a statement that ""now he had seen it all"", yet that man had allot of cash on hand when it happened and they added allot of positions after the tanking.

Trading is really not for the faint at heart.

I really don't have any good advice to give."

But it was in the early days of Cook when people weren’t sure Jobs could be replaced. But I held through it all and still own it today. It’s the single most profitable stock I’ve had at this point. I’ve a couple speculative picks that have tripled or quadrupled in a short time frame, but I lose money just as often with stuff like that. Apple seems like it’s always profitable if you just hold it for awhile. It’s nice and boring too. It rarely just shoots up or down. It mostly just goes up at a slow and steady rate or stays relatively flat."

One of the reasons you don't often see many people that bought those big giants like Apple/Amazon/Microsoft 20/30 years ago and still have it.  


And in my opinion it's good to set those targets to make sure you atleast take some profit from time to time. Doesn't mean you have to sell everything though! Or that you can't sell it and buy it a year later again."

They took full advantage of the pandemic and really grew a lot of revenue that way.

But then the back up and a bigger demand than they can supply is really hurting the business.

I honestly think that in 5yr their price could be towards the $300 range(pure speculation based of EV progress) and if the product is very well received in 5yr like how the iPhone was then this could potentially be apples next boom IMO but again this is pure speculation based on EV progress and success. Even without the EV if they keep decent innovation with the iPhone and brand growth is definitely enough to keep the price above $100 and competition with Samsung will definitely push that price up regardless as innovation goes on."

I initially was in it for the long term, but as soon as it went to $500, then $900, I got scared, and pulled some out. Figured, oh this will never happen again, people are just ""inflating the stock"". Then $2000, $2500, man I was so close to just pulling it all.

But despite all the pressure from myself and others to sell, I strongly believe in the company, and see the company for a ton more than electric cars. It's at $700 now I think ($3500 taking the split into account), and even though I did sell off a bit, I'm glad I kept a good amount because it's what I truly believed in for the long term. Won't make that mistake ever again."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Not the hardest stock to long term either, but nice job."
03/22/2021,stocks,imagine you held nokia
03/22/2021,stocks,How many shares have you been holding this whole time? And also how much do you earn in terms of salary?
03/22/2021,stocks,Always buy when you are selling ! If that’s S class stock and problem minimized
03/22/2021,stocks,"I was a couple years after you on AAPL. Held all the way through and didn't find it that hard b/c even with the articles, etc, I was always up from initial purchase.

Finally sold some last year just b/c it had grown to about half of one my accounts so sold some to diversify.  Haven't sold any in my taxable account b/c cap gains.  

Congrats."
03/22/2021,stocks,"All I can say, if there was ever a time to sell apple... It's not right now, it's been beaten down quite unfairly since it had it's last earnings"
03/22/2021,stocks,I’m a little bearish on Netflix right now but very bullish on Tesla
03/22/2021,stocks,Sir I want to be exactly like you!
03/22/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't have touched Apple with a 10 ft pole had they remained a purely intel based output. What has been putting them into interesting territory for me are the iDevice's ARM based chipsets and now the M1 desktop-grade package making them nearly as interesting as nvidia. They're blowing x86-based desktop tech out of the water, and that's the future."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yeah honestly I can look at nearly any stock now compared to a few years ago. Everything basically doubled or more than doubled.

If I simply invested a ton into any solid company just 4 years ago and held, I would be doing extremely well right now.

When everything goes up, we are technically always at the ""peak""."
03/22/2021,stocks,I bought 3 shares of amazon at $900 and sold at $1100. Boy do I feel stupid.
03/22/2021,stocks,Why  Peloton though?
03/22/2021,stocks,You (OP) have a skill that can't be taught. Well done. 💰👌
03/22/2021,stocks,"I mean yes, but that doesn't mean no company can be overvalued."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I’m in the same boat with Tesla. Made a ton, many 5 digit increase days, up by into the 6 figures, some analyst today said it’s gonna hit $3k by 2025, etc so it all seems rosy.  But then there’s been some slow march down lately that eroded my portfolio almost 6 figures. I’m still way up but it’s hard to watch some weeks with losses almost daily."
03/22/2021,stocks,I saw their spaceship 🚀. I am keeping their stock.
03/22/2021,stocks,It wasnt luck... You invested in something people bought.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I can attest to that... Did it for 6 years 🤣🤣

03/22/2021,stocks,Android has “caught up”? Android has been technologically more advanced than iPhone since at least 2012. iPhone has been behind the curve for as long as I can remember.
03/22/2021,stocks,I'm curious. How do you feel about the cannabis sector. I think it is going to be the next generational money maker. I decided not to buy individual stocks anymore after the 2000 crash. Yes big mistake on my part. I have a decent 401k but nothing compared to what it could have been. The cannabis sector has me excited. I really believe it's going to be huge. I'm already finding it difficult to hold some of my gains. I just keep telling myself it has just begun. I plan on holding for 5 to 10 years. It's always good to get someone else's perspective.
03/22/2021,stocks,Proof? Or do you mean you had 1% in your 401K?
03/22/2021,stocks,"Thank you for posting this.  I'm a covid investor.  I bought Apple when they split I own 11 shares I also own a few others. I sold many of my other shares a few weeks ago before the dip.  I kept one share of everthing,  except I kept all my Apple shares. 🍎. I also own NVIDIA I like the product. I bought at $200 a share it's up to $500 and that's with the dip."
03/22/2021,stocks,I bought tsla at 250$ in july/june and was shitting my pants that its gonna fall bc i thought it was overvalued and sold several times just to buy back at a higher price each time...
03/22/2021,stocks,I feel the same way about Peloton. They’ve had their bumps in the road. But I just feel so strongly about the brand and how they’ve innovated so far.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I get your point, but Peloton? Seriously"
03/22/2021,stocks,Fucking Peloton though?
03/22/2021,stocks,"30B in profit and 248B in revenue is very optimistic, where do you see the profits coming from?  Energy and solar are all too small.  Cars are barley profitable now but there is a chance COGS will come down, 
 So they can eek out a profit there.  The problem I see is once competition comes and they are coming, Tesla’s growth is going to slow and they will not be selling 10 million per week year 2025."
03/22/2021,stocks,That’s why I’m buying up and holding my mazda shares I think they are going to go up in these next two years with the new releases mazda is planning I know there’s not any good Dd to support this but \(-__-)/
03/22/2021,stocks,"My first stock purchase was Amazon at around $37 a share, around 2008. Dropped $10k, which was a lot of money for me at the time. I sold it when it hit $80 a share later that year. Crazy to think about now, but I wouldn’t have held it until now either. Who knew?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I’ve bought and sold Tesla numerous times for gains. Finally I’ve said just hold. 

People said they almost bought a stock or sold early means nothing. 

I remember laughing at DFV when he held at 1mill profit then laughed more when he never sold at 50 mill. Your either bag holder or genius only time will tell"
03/22/2021,stocks,"everyone thinks if i only had bought or held, at the time you make the decision you are years away from a possible boom or crash, you make the best decision in the given time frame, you take your gains or your losses at that time and move on. i used to be emotional back in 2012 about stocks and had to get over that pretty quickly."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I completely agree. I put $9K into SHOP when it was around $70, then sold at $350 in 2019. In hindsight, terrible move, but 5x in two years was pretty great returns."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yup. I bought AMZN at $14, and happily sold it at $256. Hard sigh."
03/22/2021,stocks,">Holding a profitable stock long term really is incredibly difficult. You have to have an almost fanatical belief in the company.

Or you never look at what it's doing."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Oh man I checked back the amazon stock chart in period 1999-2003, what a rollercoaster. I probably would have sold before or after the peak. Although we might consider it timing the market, I feel like we're in an EV/tech bubble too right now but it's just too unpredictable to sell right now and hope to buy back cheaper in 2-3 years."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I agree.  I mitigate this by scaling out in steps and almost never fully scaling out.  

Selling covered calls is another great way to profit from staying in the game."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I don't see what is so difficult about holding long term. For me, it is the opposite, I have a much more difficult time convincing myself that it is time to sell some stock than I do just continuing to hold. 

Holding is the easy part for me and my default behavior after I decide to buy a stock. Selling is the hard part and it takes a lot to convince me to sell a stock that  I bought into."
03/22/2021,stocks,"is it really that difficult? My father only holds his positions, he's literally been doing a solid dividend reinvestment strategy with multiple holdings for literally 20+ years now. Some of them win, some of them lose, the issue is that, for whatever reason, there are so many people who have 0 patience, who want immediate feedback, immediate gains, and want to cash out early. It's pretty stupid in hindsight. Most assets that appreciate are pretty stupid to sell unless you're actually in a position where you have to do so or risk losing some manner of livelihood. There are some stocks that certainly are dogs but even the dogs can turn into dividend cash cows and you will more than likely come out ahead in the long run as long as the brand is known and has a high likelihood of sticking around in the long term. Ultimately it comes down to, why are you investing to begin with? Is it so you can have more buying power or so that you can grow your overall asset value?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Fanatical belief in the company

Completely describes my dad who still has every single box from every single Apple product he’s ever bought.

03/22/2021,stocks,Or literally run the company and foresee growth based on merit and not fantasy
03/22/2021,stocks,"agreed, I bought at 150, sold at 300 thinking its a good deal. meh life goes on."
03/22/2021,stocks,I looked at $1k Amazon and was like nahhhh this can’t keep going. C’est la vie.
03/22/2021,stocks,"That's why you buy great companies you think have a bright future.

I have had negative experiences with Apple and was never to impressed with their products, so I  never bought them.  But there hold on the smartphone market is remarkable.  I don't understand it, but obviously the brand loyalty is there.  I can see them owning the smartphone market for another 20 years."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I had a bunch of Tesla at $48-ish in like 2013. I sold it at like $125 or so. Green is green, gotta just tell yourself that."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I'm on the end of this with NFLX. I worked there 2005ish... was part of the employee stock plan. I was getting it at 9 bucks a share for two years. Every 6 months, I was turning 1k into 3k. 

At that time, I was in college, had just turned 20, and living on my own. Turning 1k into 3k was amazing. 

I go through the calculations every so often with the price rise, splits, etc... I would've had something like 400k had I held on to that. I only worked there for 3 years before moving on. I don't beat myself up over it too much... it was amazing having a profit like that at the time but man, it would've definitely changed things had I held on to it."
03/22/2021,stocks,Those stocks also get cut in half couple times over because they trade at super high valuations a lot
03/22/2021,stocks,"The hardest part about having the conviction is knowing when the run is over.

I'm holding 2700 TSLA till 2023/2024 but even then idk what will trigger me to finally sell."
03/22/2021,stocks,"So does that teach us to pick HODL stocks based on fanatical belief? If you really dig deep enough and find that the company you want to invest in is **so fucking solid**, you decide then and there that you're going to HODL until you retire, does that actually make for a good investment strategy?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Sometimes we need or want the money. I’m in it to make money to SPEND, not just watch it sit for 20 years. I know it’s not the best financial advice, but I’d sell for a profit and then take a vacation. Plus, for every stock that maybe could go to $2000, there’s another that’ll go to 2"
03/22/2021,stocks,"but you could also make more money over the same period of time if you keep selling, buying and selling. it's definitely easier for the average person to set it and forget it."
03/22/2021,stocks,We bought 7 shares in 2006 for $900 and now have 160ish shares from splits. We recently bought 8 more shares for the first time since 2006.
03/22/2021,stocks,"To unpack it further if you have a fundamental understanding of a company you can ignore the everyday noise of news and opinion articles.

You may be in the green on a stock you own but are having a terrible time because all you see are articles saying why it’s overpriced."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I bought 1 share in 1987 for the certificate (an Apple // on the certificate which is cool) for $35. Now 216 shares with a cost basis after splits of 25c. I now have 3 different versions of their certificates on the wall but, unfortunately, recent splits are held in e-version by the transfer agent."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Agreed, Apple I never held expecting it would become biggest company in the world.
Held that they’d still be relevant hoping for some innovation. Tim Cook made the products top again and Apple Watch was big game changer."
03/22/2021,stocks,You mean a speculator vs an investor.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Good advice. And so many people focus too much on number two with ratios and screeners and whatnot, and not enough on number one."
03/22/2021,stocks,I never know what a “decent price is”.
03/22/2021,stocks,"This is also what Terry Smith is preaching.

1. Buy good companies
2. at a reasonable price
3. do nothing

So simple yet so difficult sometimes"
03/22/2021,stocks,That's essentially Warren Buffet's advice. Invest into companies not stocks.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Sounds boring. Day Trading can be insane. Can make more than my father did in a year in 3 mins, lose it all in 2.

:-)"
03/22/2021,stocks,"\#2 is actually, keep using your income to keep buying every month.

You can't time the market."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Exactly. My point is media will give 1000 reasons to sell. Amazon P/E was higher then Tesla is.
If you think company has growth still, why sell. The best companies today, have been called overvalued.

I am 100% lucky that Apple turned around company last few years."
03/22/2021,stocks,And richer!!!
03/22/2021,stocks,I sold my $35k worth of TSLA at 80
03/22/2021,stocks,"I’ve made nothing, I haven’t sold. But ill say my gains on it are over 500k which is massive to me. Like I’ve said I’ve wanted to sell lots, but today where Apple is no plans of selling stil

Edit: also bought more in 2018/2019 when it crashed. Apple Watch, music and TV got me more bullish"
03/22/2021,stocks,Tell us
03/22/2021,stocks,"Last year was my hardest, it had a big run up before covid crash. I regretted not selling some during that crash. Then when it recovered I thought I should sell again haha. Now it’s doubled since then. So now i just hold, instead of predicting"
03/22/2021,stocks,They are also already losing a ton of market share and have a debt problem that will only get worse.
03/22/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/22/2021,stocks,🤔 I thought this was someone else's opinion until you informed us at the end there
03/22/2021,stocks,Some people never sell the shares in their lifetime - they collect dividends on it for several decades and then leave their shares to family when they die. My grandma has a bunch of stocks that she is holding from the early 80s and will keep holding for the rest of her life.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I don’t even know anymore to be honest. This is one of the furthest of been on thinking of selling, 
My advice is strictly It’s not as easy people say it is to hold, especially when you’ve made a substantial amount of money"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Agreed, never recommended to hold no matter what. Simply saying holdin it  isn’t easy, even if hindsight makes it feel that way. I’ve held ten baggers and been bag holding"
03/22/2021,stocks,Yup.  I sold Apple and MSFT a couple of times......  But I also ditched GE and Citibank too.  Whew
03/22/2021,stocks,yup. I wonder what the cisco stock holders who bought at highs prior to [dot.com](https://dot.com) burst think about this post.
03/22/2021,stocks,Nokia would like a word.
03/22/2021,stocks,100%
03/22/2021,stocks,Instead they went with Shopify
03/22/2021,stocks,"Also, Apple has had two, maybe three, legit competitors.  Tesla has the entire automobile industry coming for them.  I feel strongly that Tesla will survive and be a leader in EV, but it'd be foolish to ignore the competition."
03/22/2021,stocks,"During the past 13 years, the highest PE Ratio of Amazon.com was 3732.43. The lowest was 45.10. And the median was 143.83. 

I’m not in a position to interpret this data just thought it was interesting. I remember something like “get big quick,” reasoning early on, I’d be interested in how this relates to Tesla."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Amazons p/e ratio was over 3000. Was still worth many times more in the years after. Is that a better comparison for you? I'd argue that Tesla is a much more innovative and disruptive company than Amazon with a strong brand loyalty similar to Apple. If you've read any of Warren buffets books he would have classified Tesla as a ""wonderful company"" like Sees candy due to the brand recognition and loyalty. The point that OP is trying to make is that even a company like Apple is plagued with scary headlines during every lul in stock price and that it's hard to hold through the fud."
03/22/2021,stocks,So short sighted
03/22/2021,stocks,"Lmao. Apple was making iPods and computers around then. Unless they were announcing to the world their plans to eventually dominate an entire automobile market with robotaxis, solar business, battery business, and cutting edge AI that is years ahead of the competition for autonomous driving, then I wouldn’t want it to be a PE ratio above 20.. You are right in one respect in saying you can not compare the two situations, but for very different reasons than you perceive."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I never compared the two companies worth or PE ratio. I’m comparing there brand they’ve built.
Also amazon had a PE higher then Tesla too, they seem to be doing alright"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Everyone loves to talk the trailing PE for Tesla, while ignoring how the forward PE is less than a fifth of that, and ignoring why it's so much lower.

Lets put it this way, you'd be engaging in highway robbery if you could buy Tesla shares at a trailing PE ratio of the legacy auto industry."
03/22/2021,stocks,">  I'm not even sure Apple has made over 100% in a one year period; 

Umm... have you not looked at the last 2 years of Apple's stock charts? They're up like 400% in that time period."
03/22/2021,stocks,"On Jan 1, 2020, Tesla was trading at $86/share, and they ended the year with $2.24 non-GAAP EPS (adjusted for stock based compensation). That means they were trading at a forward P/E of 38. That is ridiculously low for a company with Tesla’s growth profile (average 50% revenue growth over 5 years and forecasted 50% growth for the next 5). The reason Tesla went up 7-8x in one year is because them turning profitable exposed just how undervalued the business was, and it was also very crowded on the short side."
03/22/2021,stocks,Apple is literally up 114% from a year ago lol
03/22/2021,stocks,This is precisely the type of rhetoric holders need to ignore it they want the long term gains OP has.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Tesla is a new breed of company. It's going for a 10T valuation. They're not going to turn on the profit switch until they can ship millions of robotaxis per year and have a volume near 10 million cars a year. Right now it's all about insuring dominance in the clean energy market. 

At 3Tw of battery production Tesla will by far be the biggest battery producer in the world. They will have the battery capacity for 42 million cars.

You can't compare 650B back then to 650B today."
03/22/2021,stocks,Yes for PLTR.
03/22/2021,stocks,I never really understood PLTR - can you explain me why it's a golden egg?
03/22/2021,stocks,A good chunk of my portfolio is in PLTR. I think it’s going to be huge but I may have to skim off some profit when it reaches $30+ to diversify the portfolio
03/22/2021,stocks,Palantir seems pretty fucked up. It’s right there in the name.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I don’t think you can group this name in with OPs example just yet. Pltr Has not proven itself yet. I’m not even sure I know what they do, maybe that’s my own fault but it’s still feels like meme status for me"
03/22/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/22/2021,stocks,"What sucks for me is I started trading 9/11/2020 lmfao.
And I barely had any money so everything I invested in I had put like 1$ 5$ 10$ 20$ maximum into it then over half of those things saw a fat percentage increase. A specific doggy “stock” for instance. Don’t want my comment removed so... and a few others saw a pretty fat gain. But the assumption that someone even had enough money to get in and have it multiply and make a difference is wild."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I’m not hard on it, I’ve had a small position for a while. There a company to me that has built a brand that is hard to beat. 

I don’t see home workouts as a covid phase, I see it as the future. But that’s just me"
03/22/2021,stocks,I'm bearish on it because (1) it basically sells a single product (2) it is coming off the best scenario it will ever have (1 year lockdown) and (3) fitness is hyper trendy.
03/22/2021,stocks,"In 20 years we'll look back at today and think those 200 p/e valuations for anything that is described ""smart connected"" were at least as stupid as the valuations for anything ""dot com"" in 2000."
03/22/2021,stocks,This is the same argument about Apple. Overpriced and not differentiating enough. However they’ve continued to innovate and have a loyal following.
03/22/2021,stocks,"You're pretty misinformed on peloton.

\- Market is hardly small, nor is it for the rich. 0% financing has been gangbusters for them and is a HUGE draw for their largest demographic.

\- The software is leaps and bounds ahead of nordic track or other connected bikes, have you used them all?

Is it overvalued? Yeah, probably. Hardly a stupid bet though. As someone who owns the stock and a bike --- I don't plan on ever returning to a corporate gym and am slowly building out my home gym. A peloton tread is on the short list."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Peloton seems like a good investment base on their business model.

It's essentially fitness YouTube where you can get followers and build your own brand.

If this stay at home emphasis continues so will at home fitness."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I think Peloton is a disruptor, but you’re right. It’s based on non proprietary, non exclusive software that will not encompass an ecosystem. It does have good things going for it though 🤷🏻‍♂️"
03/22/2021,stocks,The models in ads are cute though :)
03/22/2021,stocks,"As people's lives get back to normal, more and more peletons will end up in basement next to the garage sale pile with boxes of holiday decorations piled on top.  If I was smart enough to short a stock this is one I'd be looking at."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I agree about Peloton but I have to say... as I get fatter and lazier every month, those Peloton ads look more and more enticing."
03/22/2021,stocks,I agree with you. And I’m not comparing Apple and Tesla as a company or fundamentally. I have some investments off branding not technicals.
03/22/2021,stocks,I’m very much a growth investor as well. But I also invest in established companies who have had big growth already but don’t feel it’s done.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Not saying hold everything, I know I got lucky with Apple. I’m saying holding even Apple wasn’t easy."
03/22/2021,stocks,"No but Im long on ARk holdings. I’m a bull investor, I’m in young enough to hold through possible crashes."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Haha I like it. It justifies me buying new Apple products as well, well at least iPads and phones. My MacBook is ten years old and won’t die"
03/22/2021,stocks,"That’s fair. I just think they’ve built a strong brand, not that it’s unique and hard to replicate.
And I don’t see home work outs going away post covid, but that’s just my opinion. Not everyone shares it!"
03/22/2021,stocks,"When I need to buy something big or if I need money in the future. No end goal, I just enjoy watching it grow in my account haha."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Most of your points sound good, but just want to point out that Peloton’s brand integration is being done through their app, giving that ability for people to care about the brand of bike they purchase. Apple has the same thing with iMessage, the messaging app alone is reason for people to purchase another Apple phone."
03/22/2021,stocks,"This was the narrative when it doubled in 2019, that it had its run and it’s done just slow growth now. Then it doubled again the year after. 
Point is we don’t know, saying it doesn’t have potential to grow fast again is just false."
03/22/2021,stocks,I’ve never said you have to hold. Just saying holding isn’t easy no matter how easy it seems
03/22/2021,stocks,"But they do them better 

Hence innovation 

If it was nothing, why didn't the original company do it better in the first place?

Apple isn't removing their headphone jack because Samsung did it first. 

You got it backwards. The other companies copy the worst features of apple."

Well that doesn’t show at all lol. 

For most people, phones aren’t about tech or specs. They‘re about user experience, and Apple beats Android in that regard. 

I vastly prefer my (according to you „dogshit“) iPhone SE over the flagship Samsung my work has me using. What good does a faster processor and better screen if I don’t like working with the thing?

Either has its pros and cons, and both have different strengths that cater to different people. It’s ignorant to say one is bad just because you’re in the group that prefers the other. Apple is where it’s at for a reason."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I just to be an Apple hater but, now i understand little bit more about programming i care more about resources...I have to recognize Apple, both Mac and Iphone are more efficient than Android. Finally, what is said that User Experience and comfort is key to accept one products over another.  Apple has cool design and comfort in their ecosystem. That's is for not saying about the new Apple Mac MK1 that are beasts, with their own processor hitting hard to Intel or the potential Apple Car.

Also, there is another variant, that Android is ""free"" can have hidden costs are they are selling private info, monetize your activity or forcing you to have preinstalled apps, most of them unpractical..

Altough i have to recognize that without Android competitors like Samsung we were talking about a x2-3 price product and even more service which is prohibitive for many...

You pay the price for comfort.

03/22/2021,stocks,"It's not a terrible move. You made gains.

Yes you could have made more. But you could have lost it too.

I did the bare minimum to participate), and now I have over 100 shares due to the splits. My best friend worked there longer than me, so she participated in the program much longer and her shares are now worth over $100k. The most incredible gift from a retail employee... discounted stocks."
03/22/2021,stocks,This is what I think is crazy!! people think you need thousands of shares to retire (obviously you won't retire with 20K) but it just shows when you invest in good growth companies how much you rmoney can compound
03/22/2021,stocks,This is similar to me. I purchased in 2009 though around $80 a share with $1700. I've only sold 10k of profits to help fund my first house but otherwise have heald ever since.

03/22/2021,stocks,Yep.  Or trader vs investor.
03/22/2021,stocks,"You should be looking at valuations and consider what assumptions those valuations imply. Is 50% yoy revenue growth realistic for 2 years? 5 years? Longer? What external factors could negatively affect those assumptions and how likely are they?

Valuation is hard and highly subjective. For example, a lot of growth stocks’ valuations are dependent on a low discount rate due to the fact that future revenue is expected to be much higher than current revenues. However, these kind of stocks are similar to long-term bonds, they are highly sensitive to interest rates. Small changes in current yields would strongly impact the price of growth stocks. That’s why growth stocks have been so volatile lately. That’s just one example, but it’s a good one for demonstrating how it’s important to understand what a given valuation assumes."
03/22/2021,stocks,"That's why this ""advice"" is as good as saying buy low sell high..."
03/22/2021,stocks,The problem right now is that we've had one of the biggest run ups in the history of the stock market that completely defies the economic situation.

03/22/2021,stocks,"> Invest into companies not stocks.

Isn't that kind of the original idea why stocks exist in the first place? To give companies another way to finance while also giving investors an opportunity to profit from that potential growth?

And isn't that still somewhat the main incentive?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Lol people are really missing the point you were trying to make. 

If I'd bought Tesla back in march last year, I would have sold it in like a day. Difficult to hold a stock through good and bad."
03/22/2021,stocks,"\> Apple turned around company last few years.

One thing that makes holding Apple different from the rest is its secrecy about its future plans and timelines.  You never really know with any detail what it is working on, and its major plans take 5+ years to reach an initial public launch.  More than other companies, holding the stock is a belief in the brand and that the executive team and company culture will cultivate great talent, great ideas, and execute on them.  Personally, I do have that faith in Apple.

You say it turned around in the last ""few years"" but what do you really mean by that?  You mean its stock price quadrupled since 2017.  But it's not that profit is up 4x since then, not even close.  Share buybacks reduced the share count, but the biggest factor by far is PE multiple expansion.  The reason for that PE expansion isn't a bunch of work that began after 2017, but rather the public launch of years-long efforts started well before then."

Even as late as 2010, my boss was flipping through the paper in the break room, wondering why he hadn’t held Apple years even though he was a buy-and-hold investor. I had to describe the roller coaster nature of the stock, the queasy feeling you got in September 2000 when it fell 60% over several days, and the frustration of watching it do nothing for three years even while it was rolling out some really cool products.

Someone who bought Cisco in March (?) 2000 wasn’t in Cisco for the same reason Apple buyers bought Apple."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Tesla's biggest income right now is selling the rights of their EVs to companies who don't make as many yet. That's changing. Aka Tesla's income gone, more competition, competitors who have been making cars for decades. Factoring in the hype, I would say Tesla is overvalued."
03/22/2021,stocks,"The competition is so far behind in the stuff that matters that it will take many years to catch up even if Tesla stopped today.

03/22/2021,stocks,Yeah It’s not unheard of to have PE ratios this high. It’s entirely possibly Tesla goes on to dominate the EV market and many other markets just like Amazon. Just remember for every Amazon there were 99 other tech companies trying to do the same thing.
03/22/2021,stocks,"That's actually very misleading if not false. AMZN had a P/S ratio of 2 in 2012, which is the year you cite for the 3732 PE (Q3 2012). Tesla has one of about 25 right now.

For P/E it had about a 150 PE in 2011 and in 2012 it lost money due to impairment charge and a couple of voluntarily long-term spending decisions. It was growing sales at 20-25% per year, a similar rate as Tesla.

The main difference - and the narrative on Amazon at the time in the news - was that Amazon had the ability to turn the profit spigot on during those 200 PE years. But Bezos kept investing in the long term and investors approved that. Those skeptical of Amazon weren't reading closely enough in its earnings report and where its spending was going.

For Tesla, yes they are investing for the future but they don't actually have the ability to turn that profit spigot on. In fact, their 100% margin, $1-2B profit comes directly from environmental credits - which are going away. And their P/S ratio are 10x that of Amazons at its peak. And TSLA has a PE of 1000, which is way above AMZNs 100-200 averages during that time. The 3700 one you cite is misleading and not useful in comparing them"

But that's just survivorship bias. I'm sure there were a ton of dotcom era companies with PEs in the 1000s that don't exist anymore and were only valued that high because of hype.

I like Tesla. I think they're a good company doing amazing forward thinking. But they are valued about 3x what they should be and that's already factoring in years of growth. I wouldn't be surprised if they grew into their current valuation over the next 5 years but going another 5 to 10x from here in 5 years is literally insane."

So you have to value them today and by every single metric; they are priced in for the next 4 years.  The best hope for ARK is for Tesla to maintain its share price and not crash."

IOS is extremely limiting compared to android and Apple has had some of the worst stunts ever, remember that they slowed down the older models ON PURPOSE to make you buy a new one? Or that they're suddenly environmentalists and not shipping phones with charges or ear plugs. Which proves my point that consumers are idiots, and your satisfactoin argument is based on consumer ignorance.

Apple is shit, but people buy shit all the time."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Respectfully, I disagree. I've been holding for fifteen years now. They have always been a growth stock. Sure the iPhone is the largest part of their business but not the only part. If you've watched the numbers the entire time you'd realize that Samsung was never a real threat. They may have been a slight threat in the cellular market but as far as consumer electronics companies Samsung could never destroy Apple or vice versa."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Agreed. I also often set a timeframe, and inbetween you always keep checking the news and possibly selling early or not selling at all, postponing the time frame/price target etc etc. So if there's no reason to sell, or you think it keeps growing I also just hold."
03/22/2021,stocks,"that’s dope, and congrats. I just try to understand like the motivations at that length, or like how you can generate income from it if there aren’t dividends or something. I guess for most people the long term end goal is retirement"

The point is, if you pick a good stock, buy and hold, you will make money.

Now, I have seen my portfolio drop $100k or 25% in one week on their swings. The only one I sold was $10k losses in AMC to chase more meme stocks that lost more money. I'd be up now if I held. I felt depressed at $40k losses in GME. If I bought the dip, id likely be up $50k in GME instead of even. Unless a company is going out of business, there's no reason to not double down on what you believe. Even my bad decision trades regained their peak value after inexplicably hitting a steep low. Tesla has 60% market cap and brand loyalty in a sector of the car industry that will double in growth each year, at a minimum. AMC like movie theaters is an American institution and will retain it's value. GME is definitely not a stock for average investors and it could go out of business in it's current form, but if people believe in the brand and it's ability to be reinvented, they will be at center of fastest growing sector-gaming."

For the first few years, RM's share price was poor (competition/horrible appointments for CEO), but the pandemic has seen a massive number of contracts, including NHS, land at their feet. The share price skyrocketed. 

Long story short, RM can be extremely stingy, but gifting shares all those years ago has turned out to be the best bonus my father could wish to receive."

I've been wondering if it makes sense for them to run all their investments through Apple first, that is, only buy Apple and diversify by selling Apple and using that money to buy other stocks. It sounds simple and reasonable to me but maybe I'm missing something. The only snag I see is the three year lag of the vesting process.

03/22/2021,stocks,Tim Apple made the products
03/22/2021,stocks,"This is an ignorant take because the profits of their stock haven't sky rockets ever since Jobs died. Cook was a legacy holder, not a profiteer or means of sky-rocketing the stock even further from what it was. I know this because I worked at Apple and the stock hasn't gone higher since I was there. Cook is there to hold consistency, not for innovation.

If you were a shareholder and didn't expect Apple to go huge from mid-to late 90s just means you're bad at expectations. The company was going up and up and up from there. Then they exploded even further in 2000s.

Edit: Receiving the harassive responses only says so much of you guys. No one would be messaging me if they had done well for themselves... but instead, I bruised the egos of a handful of people who are now taking the time out of they day, since they have so much of it, to try and bring me down with them. I laugh at you guys. I'm going to take screen shots and use your responses for future content on how losers respond. Thank you for showing me what losing looks like without grace.

Edit 2: It's legitimately sick to see people harass someone just because they disagree with them. You are some insufferable pricks and to assume I do not know whatever you think you know over me is just hilarious. I'm going to take your screen names and associated post and use them for material as they come in. Thank you."

My Father had a ton of Ford stock that he'd bought over the years and his financial advisor told him to sell it ASAP.

That was in maybe 1998 / 1999 when it was around $65 a share, when the big slide had started. Within ten years, Ford went all the way down to something like $1.25 a share, and there were a lot of people who lost everything, because they had their entire retirement in Ford stock.

It's a generational thing, buying and holding one stock your entire life. Your Grandfather might have even worked for Arthur Anderson, so the idea was invest in who work for and what you know.

I don't think anyone would ever suggest that now."

03/22/2021,stocks,I thought Tesla’s primary profit driver was carbon tax credits.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Tesla isn't trying to make profits, they just want to keep the cash flow positive as they scale.

They actually have a 25% profit margins on their EVs, the highest by far in the whole car industry. They just reinvest it because at this point it's free money. Each factory they build is profitable after a year of production.

To say their profits are due to the credits is ridiculous.

As for competition, I'm sorry but there is no competition. Nobody else has the batteries to scale. Everyone is years behind in technology, charging infrastructure and software. The biggest EV manufacturer after Tesla will be VW and they'll have 10x less battery capacity by 2030."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I think you need to do some serious research into Tesla based on a lot of what you're saying.

> Tesla's biggest income right now is selling the rights of their EVs to companies who don't make as many yet. That's changing. Aka Tesla's income gone, more competition, competitors who have been making cars for decades.

Sorry, but no. 

1) Tesla isn't losing money on each EV sold, they've been profitable for over a year and a half now. Plenty of others have done the math to show that Tesla would still be profitable without the EV credits. 

2) Economies of scale are a thing. i.e. the more EV's Tesla makes the cheaper it will get for them. it also costs a lot of money to build new giga factories, and a lot of money to develop the EV tech & battery technology in their stuff. But guess what, those investments will bring in far more profits for Tesla in the future then they cost today. Companies that are rapidly expanding often lose money for this reason, many very profitable companies of today lost money when they were rapidly growing in the past.

3) Making an EV isn't as simple as taking out the gas tank and spark plugs and replacing it with a bunch of batteries. The legacy automaker's have a lot of experience in making ICE cars that's no longer relevant. And they have the burden of needing to cannibalize a still profitable segment of their business to shift to a currently unprofitable segment if they want to survive in the long term. Tesla does not have that problem."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Got it. I'm gonna sell some of the TSLA stocks I bought at 650 today. With the bunny market we're seemingly experiencing right now, TSLA has become one of the prime target for daily pump and dump."
03/22/2021,stocks,"It's a good company, but the current stock price is the result of the winner's curse"
03/22/2021,stocks,Serious question: in what categories are competitors behind?
03/22/2021,stocks,"Competition *was* five years behind 2 years ago. Chinese factory changed that. Look at how much VW has caught up on energy density in just a year. The IP is out there now. 

Now it's a race to market share, and they're competing with companies that can quickly scale production to 20M vehicles a year. 

VW is surging right now because they appear to have ""won"" that battle in Europe. Ford will surge when the EV F-150 comes out with similar capabilities to the Cybertruck and without the blade runner reject design."
03/22/2021,stocks,"At current, yes.  But in five years, the landscape might look pretty different.  I wouldn't invest much money in a company that is about to face the competition they're going to.  For example, Audi and Volvo have recently said they are done developing combustion engines.  I'm sure many other companies have seen the writing on the wall, as well- electric is the future.  Right now, Tesla has that niche sewn up.  But when it is no longer a niche, but rather the norm, what happens?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"But they have many years to catch up. The infrastructure isn’t built to support 90% EVs on the road right now, and nobody is buying Tesla for their 2021 profitability and dividends. I loved the company a few years ago and believed they could grow to where they are now. Thinking they have another 5x jump in valuation ahead of them from here requires a whole lot of things to go their way."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Tesla has huge untapped profit spigots that more than offset the credits which aren’t going away as fast as you think. First off, there were tons of one time costs from the shutdown of the factory during the pandemic, as well as one time catch-up costs for Elon Musk’s compensation package (due to Tesla performing so much better than expected). Second, they have billions of dollars in deferred revenue from FSD packages that are pure software profit and won’t  be recognized until they release the FSD beta to the general public in the first half of this year. Third, Tesla’s P/E is really 308 when you adjust earnings for stock based compensation (which is not a real cash expense). 

Also, Tesla is growing much faster than Amazon ever was. Tesla’s 5 year revenue CAGR is 50% and they guided for it to continue to grow at an average 50% with some years faster and some slower due to lumpiness of production ramps.

Tesla has the same (non-adjusted) P/E today as Amazon did in 2013, and they are growing their profits fast enough that it will follow Amazon’s path"
03/22/2021,stocks,Ty. I appreciate the insight.
03/22/2021,stocks,Tesla has that same ability. Elon chooses to lower the price of cars to make them more affordable instead because he knows the real money will be in the robo taxi network. At any point he could stop passing the savings to the customers while continuing to lower cost of production. Doing so would increase profits significantly. Instead hes playing the long game. The more cars in peoples driveways the more potential robotaxis and and revenue later on. Plus more data to train FSD. You seem to not be able to look past current fundamentals. Even cathie woods knows majority of Teslas valuation will come from the robo taxi network. P/e ratio is P/e ratio. Amazons was over 3k and that is not misleading. Of course the circumstances are different but when you consider Teslas path they can easily grow into that p/e ratio later.
03/22/2021,stocks,Isn't amazon a retailer though? P/S ratio doesn't really make sense then
03/22/2021,stocks,That wasn't his point though. His point was about the difficulty of holding through the fud. You can compare them to eachother because they have both seen good and bad headlines over the years.
03/22/2021,stocks,Warren buffet also doesnt understand tech and has said so in many different interviews. It takes a lot for him to come around to anything in the tech world. Warren buffet mostly invests in banks and insurance companies old school oil/gas and legacy automakers.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Short sighted because they are just beginning to disrupt their first market with at least one major sector that they are poised to disrupt in the coming years(energy). The EV market has yet to truly explode which it will. When it does Tesla stands to be the top performer as of now. Then the energy market stands to be revolutionized and their solar panels are a dang good deal and will no doubt pop off once that market is also forced to adapt to evolving global market forces. Like some of the other large tech companies mentioned this co still stands to gain wildly. Perhaps they will innovate in the AI market which is insanely full of potential. maybe more correction is necessary in the short term, but so much upside for the long term investor."
03/22/2021,stocks,Tesla is not pricing in the next 4 years by every single metric. Only people relying on oversimplified PE or PS ratios would say this. Do a bottom up analysis of the business or at least piggyback off of another analysts work and adjust their assumptions if you want to come off as semi credible.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I disagree with ARK, in my personal scenarios for Tesla is a bear case valuation of ~$400/share (present value) based on $12 billion profit from $133 billion revenues in 2025 and a base case of ~$950/share (present value) based on $30 billion profit from $245 billion revenue in 2025. 

I think no one expected Tesla’s performance on accelerating growth and profitability in a pandemic year, not even ARK or Tesla themselves (which is why they expensed hundreds of millions of catch up expenses for Elon Musk’s compensation package in the past year)"

When Amazon was growing like weeds and when they were valued the same as Tesla is right now; their PE was ~150, occasionally hitting 200.   This is when Amazon was hitting on all cylinders and AWS was raking in the profits.   Tesla PE ratio is 1200 right now lol."

03/22/2021,stocks,"80 eoy on Pltr seems aggressive. I’m long on it and love the company, but see it slower growth. But won’t complain if it’s not"
03/22/2021,stocks,We just need someone offering to eat his shit and someone to dump his gf again
03/22/2021,stocks,"My idea since I started was to play the long game haha.


I think I started with like idk 30$ maybe? If that.
I’m sitting at just under 1500$. Not terrible for a few months and I didn’t throw stimulus money at it."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Brand loyalty. My wife has one as well as quite a few friends. Their trainers have thousands upon thousands of loyal followers. Many famous athletes are on there. They have their own clothing line, they have already made adjustments with their equipment and tactics for lack of a better word. Whoever that person or team calling the shots there are genius. Just my two cents."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Brand loyalty, excellent software and their content subscription business is the true golden goose. Many without the means to buy a Peloton bike or treadmill subscribe to this and it makes the equipment even more aspirational. It’s actually very, very good. Better instruction and more varied, professional content than pretty much any other player in the space. A bet on Peloton is a bet on content and streaming as much as it is on fitness."
03/22/2021,stocks,"My sister and BIL have one and they love the shit out of it. Talk about it all the time and use it near daily since they got it nearly a year ago. It actually got them working out regularly. 

I have no position but I just wanted to say fuck your anecdote. You sound like you've sold short on them or something."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Where are you getting all this anecdotal FUD?

>You don't see it being used in most modern gyms or at-home gyms.

I don't? You don't? We don't?

Most resort chains have a slew of pelotons now (to the point they have a 'finder' on their website). Many major hotel chains have them available. AirBNB's list them as a value add, and TONS of people are putting them in their home gyms. Nobody said to go all-in, but your confident assessment of it being a ""stupid bet"" is based on some real shaky anecdotal 'evidence'"
03/22/2021,stocks,They acquired Precor for $420 million to expand more into the commercial market. https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-signs-agreement-acquire-precor
03/22/2021,stocks,"My dude.. there are studios dedicated in their entirety to this. Not cheap ones either ie: soul cycle, flywheel, not to mention independent ones (pre crash?.) It fits in with the country club/wellness lifestyle model. There are professional spin instructors."
03/22/2021,stocks,Their media business is what you should be looking at .
03/22/2021,stocks,"I’ve been using Apple Fitness+ for the last 3 months and I have zero plans of going back to the gym, at most I may join a yoga studio for that experience. Luckily bought/had dumbbells and some basic equipment prior to COVID. I agree though, Peloton is a deep investment for all people - but I see once COVID is a thing of the past it may be a problem for them."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Cyclists use Zwift, rouvy or TrainerRoad and hook up a smart trainer to their bike. The only thing peloton has in common with cycling is their name."
03/22/2021,stocks,"But it does have name recognition and that's worth a lot.

I think they'll succeed because we are in a stage of transition. You're thinking things will go back to the way they were, I don't.


As someone who prefers home fitness over going to a gym it's much more appealing because I exactly don't have a lot of free time outside work. The last thing I want to do is waste additional time driving to and from an actual gym, sharing machine with people.

I was doing home fitness for that exact reason before the pandemic.

If you're paying monthly gym memberships, buying home equipment will pay for itself.

All businesses tend to target the higher end initially, they'll get cheaper because the real business will be monetizing sessions / app purchases"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Peloton is not for cyclists. Their market is far, far bigger than cyclists which is a true niche market. They are after the luxury market. And you do know they make more than bikes, right?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Why not? if i owned a business and I can get away not paying for a ""company space"" I save 10's of thousands of dollars per year. That alone is a huge incentive. If we need to have an in person meeting renting a space for an hour is going to be much cheaper.

there are plenty of companies out there that have realized that WFH can still get work done."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Sunk costs, convenience and time being a luxury"
03/22/2021,stocks,"They killed Contour Cameras which (as far as I knew,) superior/pro level products back when it was all just becoming a thing. The power of branding cannot be discounted IMO"
03/22/2021,stocks,"As a former lbs manager, I completely get that. But I can’t say that without saying their target market is one of means, perpetually looking for an easy button, and the strength of their branding + profit margin is pretty compelling"
03/22/2021,stocks,"You could say the same thing for Apple, you could buy a phone from a different competitor which does all the same and more. But people choose not to... why? Brand.

And Peloton has a subscription content ecosystem that rivals any fitness media company. 

Have you used a Peloton or spoken to owners of Peloton equipment or users of their subscription service?"
03/22/2021,stocks,Do you own a Peloton?
03/22/2021,stocks,"This is a good observation from the standpoint of a customer, but what does it mean from the standpoint of an investor?

I can't stand Carnival Cruiselines. I think their ships are dirty and they attract too many college-age party cruisers for me to like anything about their product. But I also believe that Carnival will rebound post-COVID and has a strong enough asset base that it is unlikely that they will die before that recovery hits.

Everything you said about why Peleton is not the best product has been said about Apple products as well. There are cheaper alternatives that offer better features available, but Apple is still a great investment.

Peleton is a luxury brand that targets a specific demographic with a subscription model that ensures steady revenue over time. How does that compare to its competitors?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"This, also exercise is like a drug in as much as it can be addictive, and for those who don’t push it there’s the interconnection/social aspect. People never missed classes/didn’t post up metrics years ago. I think the intersectional aspect is fairly compelling. If I were smarter I’d say something about behavioral economics here."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Correct, I think cult following is an underrated aspect for investing."
03/22/2021,stocks,Stay home forever? Don’t be mad bro
03/22/2021,stocks,"I obviously agree, that’s why I held. But Apple had some years where innovation was lacking is all I’m saying."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Ya I’m not comparing a workout company to the biggest tech company in the world haha. I like the brand, so I like the stock. Simple as that, I’m not an investor expert."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Exactly, they’ve built an eco system now that people may spend the rest of there life only using there products."
03/22/2021,stocks,"You’re glossing over the most important part. Brand loyalty is based on great products and service. 

It’s silly to detach brand loyalty from the fundamentals. If Apple starts making bad products that don’t last, neither will the loyalty. I recently retired a 2011 laptop. 9 years is an incredible lifespan and ROI. You bet that makes people loyal."
03/22/2021,stocks,It helps keep people from joining the rich.  They *hate* that.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but capital gains tax isn't for you, it's for the company. It's there to incentivize rich people to keep their money in one place so that companies can actually use it to do productive economic things.

EDIT: Never mind guys, I'm wrong. I thought that maybe incentivizing long-term investment would stabilize stock prices or something allowing companies to leverage their stock into better loans or something, but I'm not finding anything like that."
03/22/2021,stocks,"What the fuck are you talking about?  Long term capital gains are almost always lower than your top of bracket taxes.  That is exactly why they benefit the rich so much more.

Also, you almost always hold your money in retirement accounts which you don't use to cash out.  That's where long term buy and holds are easy.

Yes, when you spend money, you can no longer use it for investing.  Its called you can't have your cake and eat it too."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Have no disadvantage as long as the broker doesn’t die.  You still get voting power and the fraction of any dividend owed to you.

So rather than going balls deep for some people to buy 1 share of amazon, they can buy $50 worth every once in a while and it’ll eventually equal 1 share.

Fractional shares give you the power of dollar cost averaging and the ability to own shares if you don’t have a large lump sum. Combine that with free trades and I have to wonder why you WOULDN’T do fractional shares.

So if you can think of any disadvantages or think Fidelity is going to die, please state them below so I can adjust my personal risk tolerance accordingly"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Has he sold any stocks? 

I think the cash came from options."
03/22/2021,stocks,"The ""little"" he cashed out was over $10 million"
03/22/2021,stocks,">	Also DFV did strategically cash out a little so even if it went tits-up, he had retirement money in the bank.

He sold $13M worth of April $12 strike calls, about half his option position, and doubled his stock holdings, buying about $2M worth of the stock at $38 and change. You can’t do a long term hold on options, so it’s not really cashing out, just exiting that trade. He  didn’t cash out, he doubled down."
03/22/2021,stocks,"He also went in when it was like $3 a share. His expectation was never related to the short squeeze. It was just expectation that it might eventually reach $20 a share or something like that and he would be able to live off the dividends.

EDIT: a few people seem to take issue with me commenting on the dividend portion. Just because there isn’t a dividend now, doesn’t preclude the possibility of dividends being paid out in future. Hell, DFV is betting in the long-term success of GME."
03/22/2021,stocks,Don’t compare GME to Apple... actually don’t compare it to anything...
03/22/2021,stocks,"If you're talking about Ryan Cohen, he's not the CEO yet."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I can't see it being good long term. Seems like it's just running on momentum at the moment IMO.

The case for the stock being undervalued made a lot of sense when it was $4.  Now the stock is priced at significantly more than it has been for the *entire history of the company* (other than the last few months), but there's nothing happening with the company that suggests that explosion in the price in warranted.

It may still go up in the short term and people will make (and lose) money on the volatility.  The only way I could see it being good long term is if the irrational exhuberance we are seeing now continues long term as well."
03/22/2021,stocks,They have $8b in revenue pre-Covid. There are companies with less than $1b revenue valued at $50b
03/22/2021,stocks,If I had a dollar for every Fuck up I ever made... I'd probably put it all into GME at $450 and sell at $45.
03/22/2021,stocks,I’d be a multimillionaire on all my what ifs lol.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I don’t understand why more publicly traded companies don’t literally give employees stock they can’t sell immediately as part of their compensation. Nothing makes you care about the company you work for like owning a part of it and having your finances tied to its fate for more than just not getting fired. People always talk about government employees not having any profit motive, but most private sector employees don’t have any profit motive either if they’re hourly or salaried."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Royal Mail is now hitting the same price it was two years ago, so surely all that’s happened is he’s regained the losses."
03/22/2021,stocks,Is 20 grand in 10 years a good enough ratio to retire on?
03/22/2021,stocks,"u/Maximum_Structure_93, a true definite genius you are... congrats."
03/22/2021,stocks,"thats plain wrong. apple was in its biggest crisis in the mid 90s. jobs had left, nobody was using apple and most software was only made for windows. it was the imac g3 that turned the ship around but apple was a niche product well into the 2000s."
03/22/2021,stocks,">I know this because I worked at Apple and the stock hasn't gone higher since I was there.

Is this a troll? The stock had its ATH in late January this year."
03/22/2021,stocks,Imagine being a secretary at Apple and then spouting off like this lol
03/22/2021,stocks,Yeah okay bud... the last part of your statement is agreeing with what I’m saying yet I’m ignorant. I guess Apple isn’t making more money now than when Jobs was alive huh?
03/22/2021,stocks,"I don’t think Jobs would have chosen Cook if he didn’t expect much of him. Especially, if you worked there or know how Job’s was.  The “ignorant” comment WAS uncalled for, really."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Lol I was looking to see what terrible harassment you endured, but literally just a handful of comments explaining why you don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about. That’s not harassment, that’s putting a stop to confident ignorance spreading disinformation."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I don't think you understand what stock splits are champ...Tim Cook has taken the stock to all time highs and made it the largest company in the world. I do agree with you that Cook wasn't the innovator that Jobs was. But Cook has been an excellent steward, taking what jobs built and growing it. Consumers love Jobs, investors love Cook."
03/22/2021,stocks,How many times bigger than the second biggest company on the planet would Apple need to be for you to consider Tim Cook a success?
03/22/2021,stocks,Swiss is just one brand and these are shipped not sold.
03/22/2021,stocks,not only that but it's years later and no one else even has a competitive product
03/22/2021,stocks,"""must have"" can you chug the kool aid any faster?"
03/22/2021,stocks,What? No they did not turn a gimmick to must have. You guys are delusional. 22m in whole for smart accessories is small.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Quite the opposite in fact. I am saying that valuation is a complex task and could honestly be a full time job in and of itself. I don’t have the time, energy, or belief that I could do it better than the thousands of financial analysts that work for banks with better data and resources than me, so I just stick to index funds outside of a few fun bets.

However, looking at fundamentals will consistently yield more reliable results so if someone wants to pick stocks I’d recommend learning how to do it."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Exactly so how do you ""pay a decent price"" when by most metrics almost every single company is overvalued right now and even a 10% pull-back after the already 10% pull-back will still see the company be valued at a 10% growth YoY?"
03/22/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/22/2021,stocks,Excellent foresight and maturity for sure. Holding for 15 years and you’re still in your 30’s! I was doing much less profitable things in my early 20’s.
03/22/2021,stocks,Did you start investing in apple at 15 years old? lol
03/22/2021,stocks,What do you do for a living?
03/22/2021,stocks,Any idea how much in dividends you've collected from AAPL over the holding period? You bought it at such a low price that you might have already made your investment back in dividends.
03/22/2021,stocks,Hope you're selling way OTM calls on it to at least get some monthly income
03/22/2021,stocks,"One called contract at $160 in a taxable account with his nearly-zero cost basis would hit pretty hard...

He'd pay around $2400 per contract in taxes. The full tax implications of it depend on what he does with the income. It's not a straight $2400 loss though, since in many (most) cases he would be paying capital gains tax at *some* point..."
03/22/2021,stocks,"If you are thinking about selling at some point, no reason not to, free money. But seek advice."
03/22/2021,stocks,I think blowing up the Sept of Baelor was the last big peak GoT moment for me
03/22/2021,stocks,It wasn’t legally binding. And he gave it to us while he was still alive. So we wanted to honor his wishes.
03/22/2021,stocks,Well they showed their hand to millions of new investors with the GME saga. Maybe the FUD from financial news will be easier to ignore now.
03/22/2021,stocks,I think we are describing the same thing here.
03/22/2021,stocks,I think you’re mistaken to underestimate the competition in such a saturated market
03/22/2021,stocks,"Ay don't take investment advice from me man, I'm fucking retarded"
03/22/2021,stocks,Operating with a 'Silicon Valley' mindset when developing products. Tesla can push a full update to their cars that can fix real issues. Learning to operate that way and building the expertise and architecture to do so are real endeavors.
03/22/2021,stocks,Battery and autonomous driving. Also it will be years before legacy automakers can sell their cars for a profit.  Tesla could profit now but they keep passing savings on to customers. They know the money is in robotaxis and the more cars they can get out now is  more potential robo taxi revenue in the future.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I can’t believe that Ford didn’t take a Tesla power plant and drop it in the 150.... 

I mean it sounds crazy to say but it would have really been a bombshell of a release. 

The Silverado. The 150. The Denali. 

Once they make the move it’s history."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Lol, if you think VW is anywhere close to Tesla you are misinformed. They are still years behind."
03/22/2021,stocks,It's easy to say you'll be done and to make a prototype. To scale up to mass production and source batteries is what will take time. Problems Tesla has already faced and conquered. Legacy automakers will lose money for years trying to stay relevant and play catch up. Meanwhile Tesla will be the largest battery maker in the world and will have completed FSD before legacy could even begin to profit.
03/22/2021,stocks,"tesla stock isnt being bought for their cars, its being bought for their AI, energy storage, and battery development. look into them a bit more, yes companies are making ev's but they will all end up relying on rhe ecosystem tesla is building"
03/22/2021,stocks,"If he raises the price, he sells fewer cars. Don’t ignore economics 101. It’s foolish to think those principles don’t apply to Tesla. 

On the PE front, Its totally misleading to cherry pick one quarter out of dozens. Tesla could go down 80% and then be at Amazon’s historical PE during its major growth years"
03/22/2021,stocks,And Tesla’s an automaker for the most part.
03/22/2021,stocks,I understand your point. I guess I’m looking at it from a different angle. For example when the bad headlines came out about Apple a value investor could of looked at the financials and confirmed to themselves this is a good investment. While with Tesla you have to go off of speculation.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yes, and that’s why many tech companies don’t fall under the “wonderful business” umbrella and why Buffett advises not to invest in them. If you look at tech he has invested in, like Amazon and Apple, it’s very clear why he holds them.

If you want to speculate on Tesla, then buy Tesla. If you want to invest like Warren Buffett, then buy BRK. His books are useful, but Buffett is still alive and there’s no reason to theorize about how he would view/classify companies. He’s still openly doing it."
03/22/2021,stocks,Maybe so... I can’t tell future. I can tell you it’s not comparable to buying Apple in 2006. I would be very careful not to confuse value investing with speculative investing.
03/22/2021,stocks,The problem is that Tesla is valued as if the EV market had already explodded and they were leading it.
03/22/2021,stocks,Yeah; I didn’t price in the meme metric nor the Vaporware FSD metric nor the robo taxi metric.
03/22/2021,stocks,"ARK is also pushing the robo taxi and FSD narrative to fit her price target.  I don’t see any meaningful revenue from the energy nor from the semi.  The semi might not even be out in 2 years.  Everything you have mentioned is priced in.

You guys hate fundamentals but here’s one:  When Apples 2017 valuation was similar to Tesla’s, ~700B; it’s PE ratio was 16.  Tesla’s PE ratio at 700B is 1000+."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Older car companies have a set back that Tesla does not, however: they’re managed in old fashioned ways, mostly by boomers, and don’t really invest in new technologies the way Silicon Valley companies do. It’s much more prestigious to work at Tesla as almost any type of engineer compared to Ford or GM despite the latter having better production pipe lines. So that’s where the talent floods and that’s a huge advantage in industry leadership.

It’s not the worst strategy to evaluate 
a company by the strength of its talent recruitment. I mean, for all the factors that go into company potential, at the end of the day, it is only as great as the talent it attracts because it’s an organization of people, not statistical metrics."
03/22/2021,stocks,">The only way I see Tesla breaking $1k is by means of a huge innovation, which frankly I don't know what that wouldd be

This said it all. You just don't know enough to understand. I'm all in Tesla here and i think ARK price target is CONSERVATIVE"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Famously, no other company in the history of the world has tried setting up shop in China, knowing full well their IP will not be protected there.

Oh wait, literally every big company has done that, including Apple"
03/22/2021,stocks,"> Tesla's tech edge has evaporated.

[citation needed]"
03/22/2021,stocks,">I'm not sure how Musk thought any of their IP would be safe manufacturing in China

Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Tesla publish their patents for everyone to use? Or did I just dream that?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"What, lol?  I’m am comparing apple when it was 700B.  That was only 2-3 years ago.  It isn’t ages ago like 2000."
03/22/2021,stocks,Dude said he had 730 shares on WSB like 2 months ago
03/22/2021,stocks,Do you even know what they do? Doubtful since you made a stupid comment regarding “Q shit”.
03/22/2021,stocks,"That’s an incredible ROI for your $30. Seriously! The market is not always so generous...that’s one of the reasons why having long plays helps cushion your account when volatility strikes. 

I personally am no where close to retiring so I don’t mind more risk. I have more time to experience more crashes or peaks (hopefully the latter) and have plenty of time to be able to recover. Back when the financial crisis hit, I’d just started investing the year prior. That was an interesting experience to go though, to say the least, and witness how much money just evaporated. I got beyond lucky and made some money, but still. So many people were not lucky at all and lost everything. Literally, everything. 

If you learn nothing, and it sounds like you may already have, but never invest money you’re not willing to lose. It’s the best advice you can get in this game. I heard in the very beginning and I am glad I listened. I hope you do well for yourself. It sounds like you’re off to a great start!"
03/22/2021,stocks,Peloton has nothing to do with cyclists
03/22/2021,stocks,"i'm well aware of what Peloton does and is trying to do. i'm just not on the side that's betting enough people are going to be so interested in fitness that they will cough up the thousands of dollars for these things.  the pandemic fitness boom will have some lingering, mid-long term staying power but it will go right back to near pre-pandemic levels within a year or two. history is littered with fad exercise products, i don't see Peloton breaking that trend."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Working from home might increase, but we're talking about working out from home.  If people work from home, I would think they would have even more incentive to go to the gym.  Most people do not want to be in their house 24/7."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Branding is absolutely important is a huge tool for companies, but I think an ecosystem or something to lock people in is important as well. Apple and Google(to a lesser extent) try to lock people into the ecosystem so moving is prohibitive and keep buying into that product platform. When there is nothing holding you there, its easy to jump to the newest brand or some other brand to take over."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Fair enough, I sometimes forget people don't enjoy suffering as a hobby as much as I do."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I've looked at enough reviews online when looking at them, doesn't suite my needs. A concept 2 bike erg is $1000 and is a much better fitness product but if you want gimmicks then have at it."
03/22/2021,stocks,Not interested in owning one.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Peloton is more or less doing the bare minimum while charging luxury prices IMO. No different from those P90X tapes people used to hoard or just about every bowflex product except their dumbells. 

So yes from an investing standpoint they make money because people are lazy and look for the easy route thereby giving them their moat. Additionally the subscription is an added bonus in that people will keep paying for it like a gym membership they never use. 

Apple makes good products, android offers more customization but objectively speaking an iphone or macbook is a solid product used by F500 and government around the world."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Say nice things about Norwegian Cruise lines please, it’ll make me feel better."
03/22/2021,stocks,Who’s mad? I said good for you. Buy with conviction. I sold PTON at $160. Very happy.
03/22/2021,stocks,"You're statement is based on faulty conclusions. Case-in-point: the idea that only an expensive product should last a long time. The fact is, ALL devices should be capable of lasting a long time without breaking. They don't, because of Planned Obsolescence. Apple products are almost universally overpriced ($1000 for an iPhone that has the same or lesser specs to a $300 android phone? Hmm...). I say brand loyalty, but what I mean is brand fanaticism. People buy Apple products for that big shiny fruit on the back, not because they're ""good"" or ""quality"". Apple is like Tesla: owning one is a status symbol. I might change my mind if Apple starts pricing things competitively, but as long as I can buy a windows laptop or an android phone with *better* specs for less than half the price, it will be obvious that Apple is overpricing their stuff."
03/22/2021,stocks,Ew... the common folk.
03/22/2021,stocks,Yeah a capital gain tax on AMOUNT of stock held would be way better for retail investors than a terrible middle class capital gain tax in the 20’s when the top capital gains tax is only low 30’s. That’s ridiculous!
03/22/2021,stocks,Classic they.
03/22/2021,stocks,"That is absolutely not true.  No incentive is ever needed to incentivize people to MAKE MONEY.  

The capital gains rate could be 90% and people would still want to make money because they would at least get 10% of the gains.

It is absolutely just a tax shelter for the idle rich and trust fund babies."

03/22/2021,stocks,Nah he went in higher than that because the stock crashed a further 50% and people called him an idiot for holding.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yeah I'm pretty sure what he's holding onto at this point is partially for his ability to carefully/legally influence price movement. He has to stay in to keep that power alive. Also to have his actions match his words ""I like the stock""  until the risk of some bogus regulatory lawsuit blows over. Plus it's just the right thing to do for karma. To help all the bag holders keep hope alive. He's a really good guy. Idealistic. Unselfish.

03/22/2021,stocks,TRUE
03/22/2021,stocks,"In addition to what u/player2 said, another reason is because companies have proven over the last 10+ years that they simply don't give one dry, crusty shit about their employees. No more pension, stagnant wages, crap benefits, longer hours, do more with less time (you're expected to automate regardless of your job role now), etc etc.

Employee company loyalty is dead, and the company is the one that killed it."

Ford & Tesla are having fun with the ""rivalry"" that Tesla has been winning handily but don't discount that both still want to destroy the other... They're competitors and Ford buying the Tesla drivetrain to put in their truck would kill their margins and strengthen their rival.

Should be a fun fight to watch! 

I like the Rivian pickup a lot myself."
03/22/2021,stocks,"They've got 3X the market share of Tesla in Europe already. I think they'll sell plenty of 370HP AWD self-driving capable 400mi range VW busses for under $50k starting in a year. That's a far better package than the model Y. Taycan was last generation battery tech and is still a far better performance EV than anything Tesla has made on a track. 

They also don't get flunking grades for quality control & panel gaps, and the drivetrains don't get nerfed after 3 minutes power due to heat sink issues. 

They're an absolute bargain with a market cap under 200B for the likely eventual winner and current #1/2 current auto company in the world, shares only dropped down to these low levels because of dieselgate, and that's well in the rear view mirror. 

Tesla's bull case always required them becoming the absolute king of market share. They moved too slow, and that's why VW is surging this year... They're eating Tesla alive in Europe and coming to the States in-full next year. Chinese market will always be split amongst many brands including Chinese companies like BYD, so... where exactly is this exponential Tesla growth coming from? Every Mustang EV sold has meant one fewer Tesla sold according to the numbers. If they were ahead 5 years in tech, which they're clearly not, they wouldn't be losing market share to inferior competition. The tech gap is basically meaningless at this point, and will mean nothing at all in a year."
03/22/2021,stocks,"As far as the battery dev and energy storage, VW had a Tesla-inspired ""Power Day"" last week, and will have capacity to build batteries *without* Tesla's involvement for up to 20M/EVs per year by 2030. 

Many other competitors out there for AI and self driving, some self driving tech considered farther along and more reliable than Tesla's. 
 

A network of easily replicated ""charging stations"" isn't going to hold the other manufacturers back, either. Might take a chunk out of QT/Sheetz business, at the worst."
03/22/2021,stocks,Lol tesla could have not done the last 5 price drops and demand would still be higher than supply. He doesnt NEED to lower the price. Hes does it to sell more car because the autonomous driving is where Teslas real valuation will be.

And if the market were to do that, I would buy the dip, because IF Tesla were to survive such a thing then when the market goes into a bull run Tesla and other tech growth stocks that are in high demand rise so fast.

Thing is -- cell phones are pretty basic and there wasn't a lot of value to that IP. The development cycle for a new cell phone is also a fraction of that for a car or new battery technology. You can come up with an innovation in cell phones and put it into production the next year, knowing that it'll be emulated by the start of the following year. 

Now if Apple'd had, say, batteries that lasted twice as long as competitors with an equivalent power draw, or a screen technology 4 years more advanced than competitors, that would have been quite a different thing to willingly give up!"
03/22/2021,stocks,"There's also a plethora of small companies trying innovative things on their own as well, like QuantumScape. There are still revolutionary advances taking place in battery capacity and autonomous driving and it's not just huge slow-to-change established industry players they're competing against for those technologies, it's more agile small companies that are the size and scale that Tesla was 10 years ago. I'm not so sure I'd bet Tesla against the entire industry forever.

03/22/2021,stocks,That would be true for the most part if he didn't double his share count at 40. He for sure is in it for the long hall and believes the fair value is somewhere above 40. Where he believes it is who knows.
03/22/2021,stocks,"What you're getting at isn't fully correct. For RSUs (restricted stock units) that a company gives out to an employee as part of the compensation, you're right that they are treated as income. But that's only when they vest and they can actually be sold. You won't pay any tax on them while you are waiting for them to vest (and can't sell them)."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Typically when you are granted RSU’s the first time you pay tax is on vest date, and typically shares are sold to pay those taxes upon vesting."

As I started the year after they floated and was part time at that time I only got a few (180) and you’re right they were locked in but for 3 years then you could cash them but had to pay NI & tax on the shares. After 5 years you could cash them in with only a small fee paid to the broker and no tax & NI. Most posties were going to sell in 2018 when the 5 years were up but Royal Mail put out an unexpected profit warning just before and the shares plummeted to £1.50ish (not that it sounded pre-planned, much!) so we held on and now it’s up to £5.30. Some of the old timers in our office got 1000s of shares so they’ve got a nice bonus coming if they cash in now!"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I agree, math seems off. Splits were 7:1 and 4:1...they’d have closer to 200 shares unless they sold some. Either way, that’s a great ROI."

The 380 value you’re on about wasn’t higher than the 140 all-time high value the stock reached in 2021, because there have been stock splits along the way, I think the awkward part is that YOU are the one ignorant when it comes to Apple stocks:

How many times has Apple's stock split? Apple's stock has split five times since the company went public. The stock split on a 4-for-1 basis on August 28, 2020, a 7-for-1 basis on June 9, 2014, and split on a 2-for-1 basis on February 28, 2005, June 21, 2000, and June 16, 1987.

There are already other EV companies getting started which show great potential. Others might start up too as the tech advances and it will advance quickly. It would be silly to say that Tesla won’t be a/the leader in EV’s but it would also be very silly to assume they don’t have strong competition in the auto market

Market share is only relevant when the landscape has matured. Wait until Giga Berlin is up and running and they'll absolutely give VW a run for their money.

The demand for the next few years far outpaces the production of all manufacturers combined, and that's not even considering metal and silicon shortages.

Though not sure where you got those 2020 numbers from. Are you adding up BEV + PHEV? The entire argument for EV with a green wave is that ICE and PHEV will be phased out.

Your point regarding QA is true. However, until at least 2025 this is purely a numbers game of who can scale the fastest.

There is currently, to my knowledge, not another EV car that offers the entire package that a Tesla offers with regards to range, acceleration, software and charging.

The ID.4 is a great attempt (and it looks great) but it's not close to Tesla just yet.A car that looks great but weighs 100kg/300kg more than a model Y and model 3 and does 0-60mph in 7.7 seconds is far from a Tesla killer. These are the details Tesla has been getting right the last five years. They now get to focus on scaling and improving density. VW needs to do the same and a ton more.

For the record - I own both VW and Tesla and I genuinely believe VW will become one of the leaders in EV and is still at an attractive entry point.I also think Tesla is, and will likely, remain ahead for the next years."

03/22/2021,stocks,"You make no sense. Let's unpack this. 

1. You say Musk lowered the price of his cars, which is the reason they aren't making a profit off of their vehicles. 
2. You say Tesla has too much demand and not enough supply of cars (they're selling everything they make), and this still would have been true if not for the price drops
3. You say this is the case because Musk wants to get cars on the road for the taxi service.

\#2 and #3 make no sense. According to you, they sell the same exact number of cars at lower prices as they would at higher prices. So Musk could raise prices and still have the same number of cars on the road for the robotaxi business. So why would he lower the prices? Do you see how you make no sense?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I think the takeaway here is that P/E is a crap number to look at for fast-growing companies.  Earnings could be near zero or negative because of throwing money into growth.  So we ignore P/E, what do we look at?  

If we look at P/S, Amazon hovers between 3 and 5 for the last 5 years.  

Tesla was between 1.7 and 7 for most of the last 5 years, until April, when it shot up and hit 30.  With the recent price drop, it's down to about 23.  

I don't know whether Tesla's price will be justified by time, but the situations don't look all that similar using P/S"
03/22/2021,stocks,"For you an investment in Tesla makes sense then, as you know the potential downside risks and are happy to take them.

Tesla has absolutely nothing to worry about. By 2025 they will be begging for Tesla to sell them batteries."

They'll be perfect for the grocery getting that most people use their trucks for, though. Maybe the solution is selling extended-range battery kits that strap to the trailer and hook into the power hookup on the truck... that would be clever."
03/22/2021,stocks,"The ID.3 is selling at about a 4-5X clip versus the Model 3 across Europe. Tesla fell from about 30% of EV market last year in Europe to about 10% currently in terms of quarterly sales. Their Up is also selling in crazy numbers. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-26/vw-s-id-3-quickly-climbs-to-top-of-europe-s-electric-car-market](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-26/vw-s-id-3-quickly-climbs-to-top-of-europe-s-electric-car-market)  


I think as the market leader, market share is critical. It shows preservation of momentum and shows ability to compete, which is a bit different than capturing the early adopters.   


Agreed on materials -- I'm in the research and buying phase for REM mining companies and lithium producers these days, as there will be massive profits there and there is little REM production outside of China - that's the bottleneck coming after we get through the current chip shortage. Speaking of -- potentially big opportunity for Tesla there, as they shouldn't run into that shortage having control of more of their supply chain.  


I'm not a huge fan of the current ID.3 and coming ID.4 and have been a bit surprised at how well they're selling. The one I have my eye on is the ID Buzz (Bus), which they're projecting at 370HP and 5.2s quarter mile with the AWD (which matches up with the weights). The interior looks incredibly designed, and it'll be a perfect baby-mobile for my wife and I as we have a little one on the way. Otherwise I agree that Tesla makes the best all-around vehicles in terms of overall capabilities, I just don't know that making the best-of-all-worlds is always making the best actual vehicle. A model S P90D is as fast as a Taycan in a quarter-mile, gets an extra 100+ miles of range, and pulls about the same skidpad and braking numbers, but it can't stand repeated track abuse like the Taycan - which leaves a niche that Porsche met with that. The model Y might be a better ""all around vehicle"" than even the Buzz I want to get, but the Buzz will fit my lifestyle much better.   


I bought a fractional shares of Tesla at around $370 in Sep just so I could track how it was doing versus my other investments and it's done better than most. Bought a lot of VW back when it was under $20, and a little early this year as it started to surge above $20. I think they're the two big players for the future... I expect Tesla to churn a bit for the next couple years as people wait for results to justify further valuation, and VW I think is at a great buy point still. All just my opinion -- I am no financial advisor!  Like you said, there's so much emerging market here that there's room for more than one winner in the long run, and more than 1 $1T car company IMO."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I'd be very interested to see where UBS gets their numbers. Making money off software really means you're charging people for an inherent capability of the car... IE paying to use the Lidar sensor system it already has installed. 

That becomes a differentiator during purchase. If VW or Ford or BYD or Honda or whoever have equivalent tech and include it in the purchase price, that shapes people's decision making process. Porsche is famous for their cars having a base price around 80K and being optionable up to $200k, it's the same price model just with software. I think that model will become obsolete IMO. People won't want to pay extra to unlock the hardware capabilities of their vehicle by paying for an extra software package."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I think you're making the major bull case for them, which still makes sense, I'm just not personally an adherent. 

To be 100% honest I did want to own Tesla a few years ago... in car form :p. I lost interest once I found out Tesla was controlling the used market and could downgrade models after resale and that the Model S models lost a lot of the performance after 1 or 2 quarter mile runs or mins of spirited driving. 

I'm not seeing a lot in terms of companies signing strategic partnerships for battery production, I'd think a lot of the major manufacturers will want to have their own supply chain for battery production to avoid that dependency, but if Tesla can't keep up with market share of vehicles they could become a battery sales company, I suppose. That won't carry the same profit margin though."

03/22/2021,stocks,"I think we're mostly on the same wavelength then.   
My only gripe is that market share gives a skewed vision. VW has indicated a much slower production growth than Tesla heading into 2025. If those numbers are to be believed Tesla should by all accounts be ahead or at least equal to VW in EU.  And that's something that market share, without any comments, doesn't take into account.  
Tesla's ability to scale with Giga Berlin and Giga Austin should be interesting to see.

Fully agree on the lifestyle aspect. I like Tesla as a company but I would not buy a Tesla or any EV today as I wouldn't even be able to properly charge it, which is why I'm also big on charging stations.

There will always be a performance car doing it better, or a compact car with more milage - but I do believe that few are offering the Tesla package at the same price for at least some years. 

The model 3 did outsell the ID.3 for 2020 (87k vs 56k) but your point stands into 2021. The ID.3 is on par with the Renault Zoe for January deliveries.

03/22/2021,stocks,"With stocks the name/brand/product is ultimately very important. Most of the reliable and higher dividend stocks are stocks that are in so called matured markets.  
Think of stuff like railways(less relevant in US), telecommunication (Verizon), postal services, but even stuff like Coca Cola.  


While any massive recession will invariably hit them as well, ultimately they're so necessary or so recognizable that they're less susceptible to market swings.  
The market can go to shit, but people will still need to place phone calls, use the internet or send a package/letter.  


Meanwhile stuff like Coca Cola. The market can crash and people can buy it less, but the brand Coca Cola is so strong that barring some massive scandal it will always recover.

03/22/2021,stocks,would say very dependent on the stock not the dividend. F being a good example. Stopped the dividend but now performing better. Some say stocks paying dividends are moving out of growth and not creative enough to find ways to spend or grow money (i disagree and only real way to pay back an investor that holds in perpetuity). arcc and its peers are good ones if looking for high dividend (reits or bdms). more likely just more mature companies.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I also had a few dividend stocks in March that declined, maybe not as much as my other stocks, but I wouldn't say they provided a floor. The problem is that yes, it is possible that dividend stocks have a floor, hence investors might be willing to park their cash in the stock. But, the company still has to generate the cash to pay out as dividends. If the dividend comes into question or it is cut, you can be sure that the stock price will fall to the floor (especially if it is a dividend aristocrat or dividend grower). It depends on why the market is crushing, which is much harder to assess in times of stress."

03/22/2021,stocks,Depends on the stock. Verizon held up well last March while a lot of utilities and the rest in the so-called “high dividend low volatility” fund went in the toilet.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Dividend does not mean ""safe"". It means only safer.

Most dividend companies are specific types that take earnings that could be reinvested and instead return it back to shareholders.

Company: this could an industry, like oil and gas, where dividend are popular but those stocks are also affected my macro and geo political events (war, natural disasters, shortsges, too much).

Investor: ppl like dividends, so more ppl will be willing to hold if they get some kind of return. There are many stocks that have high yields but their stock price barely moves. Depends on what type of activity you are looking for.

Ideally you want a high dividend yield on a company with a iron clad moat. So that they are not as impacted on their business but not investing as much in their company due to dividends"
03/22/2021,stocks,QYLD
03/22/2021,stocks,"The thing about dividend stocks is that they are more straightforward to value than situations where there's no cash or where the business is using the cash for other purposes (note: not nearly all of such situations are ideal either). The fact that a business can't reinvest profits doesn't make it a bad investment alone (a dollar is a dollar regardless).

The other important thing to consider is [""agency risk""](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agencyproblem.asp), which just like valuation, is not straightforward. Dividend paying companies are usually quite clear about their intent of how much and when is returned to shareholders (of course, this can just as well be achieved with buybacks as many companies do)."

that's going to be a pretty big over simplification. you need to look at stuff that is **historically** high and not just something that recently became high due to a loss in value.

something like T or PEP? yeah, those dividends are safe. random tanking stock that's over 10%? not so much. of course, with those examples those companies being able to truck on during a recession is simply because they're consumer necessities. you still have to have a phone and buy food in a recession."

We are looking to purchase in the next 18 months and I understand we have a risk of this being a negative investment, but I’m also not sure if even the conservative potential of 10% is worth it on, say, a $2500 profit.

03/22/2021,stocks,"To answer ur question it's risky. 

Etfs do Diversify and that does reduce risk sure. But an ETF like arkf is specifically centered around one industry. What happens when that industry becomes non favored by the market ? Other industries will be favored instead and now ur under on ur investment until the market changes it's fine. 

Most of arkfs holdings seem to be in tech with a hint of blockchain? So what happens if by the time u need this money the fed decides to hike up interest rates which causes tech to drop and the market to veer towards other industries outside of tech? 

I like what ark does , and for what it's worth I hold a good amount of SQ, but it is not a good one etf portfolio. It's a great product to include in ur overall portfolio but it's risky by itself if u have a short time horizon. If u want to be invested in the market tracking the S&P 500 is probably a lot safer if u need the money in a few years.

Is ARKF more likely to outperform the benchmark in the long term? Research and a circle of competency in the fin tech space are probably the next step.

I guess I think the above work through is important when thinking about risks in equity markets. What is the benchmark and what is my case for why I think my pick will outperform it. Good luck!"

03/22/2021,stocks,Then dont go with ARK
03/22/2021,stocks,+ I like how they'd prepared ARKG for the recent Nasdaq correction by purchasing a lot of big pharma companies like REGN in January. They clearly know the market cycles and are really good at adjusting to them. That makes me feel safer to hold ARKG if there is a correction or a bear market for a while
03/22/2021,stocks,Out of all genomic ETFs I find their analysts the most competent. I've been subscribed to their email genomic news for a couple of years and their articles and commentary makes me believe they clearly know what they are doing

&#x200B;

This is what I call disruption, #1online retailer going against the top Telehealth company in the world!"
03/22/2021,stocks,I know Amazon is on a lot of peoples shit list regarding their handling of workers attempting to unionize but damnit If they don’t continue to deliver reasons to invest; what an absolute powerhouse of a company.
03/22/2021,stocks,"This is a nothing burger. I don't think people realize the stickiness of telehealth services and HIPAA compliance issues. Not to mention how long it takes to integrate partnerships with major health insurance providers. TDOC is international at this point. 

Amazon is known for throwing things at the wall to see if it sticks. It's a strategy that's worked for them, however they've had their share of failures along the way (fire phone). Telehealth is vastly different than any other service they've provided in the past. If anything I think it's going to be a superficial/add on service that's paired with refills and little else. 

I've been investing in TDOC before the pandemic and the Livongo merger was a huge catalyst for adding to my position. Didn't even know ARK was buying TDOC if I'm being completely honest. 

They're currently caught on the wrong side of the rotation out of stay at home stocks. Fact is they've been growing prior to covid and will continue to grow even faster now. When you couple convenience and savings you get a high net promoter score and a value proposition most patients will come back for again and again. 

My wife is a telehealth nurse practitioner (not TDOC) so I've had my share of insight into the importance of data, integration of systems, partnerships, necessary growing pains, compliance and regulatory hurdles etc.  It's not as easy as solving logistics problems and while Amazon has the capital, I personally think this will be a few years in the making and slower than they anticipate. 

Important to note TDOC tapped less than 1% of the TAM thus far. The fact that Amazon is trying to capture a significant portion of TAM tells you it's a huge opportunity for many players. End of the day this is an acknowledgement and a nod to the viability of telehealth. 

TDOC is on a fire sale and I'm maxed out for what I've allocated of my portfolio. Watch what happens over the coming few years, you'll be kicking yourself for not having a piece. Obviously don't invest if you don't have conviction but I highly encourage anyone interested to jump down the rabbit hole."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Amazon will see $4,500 in 2021"
03/22/2021,stocks,AMZN will probably win if there are no anti-trust issues.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I sold TDOC and moved to AMZN. pandemic is almost over and idk if teledoc will get same valuation later on. Cathie wood hype lifted up TDOC price, not sole TDOC’s reputation. AMZN got more diversified portfolio and if they fail on tele-health, they got other parts of business to survive"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I see this as a commodity business. What is to stop every insurer to create their own? I am afraid that everyone might be getting excited about this like they did when they saw companies have an internet website back in the 90s. 

Also, I a prescribe psychiatric medications and do telehealth and use the free Doxy.me or Google Meet services."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I don't think anybody here cares about how Amazon treats their workers, lel"
03/22/2021,stocks,"How do you think doctors just offering telehealth themselves (eg using zoom) will impact TDOC? Many of our doctors already offer that.

One thing I didn’t like about TDOC was that they’re not able to write lab orders. Have you read anywhere whether that’s on their roadmap?

Overall I agree though, Telemedicine is here to stay."
03/22/2021,stocks,Can you share your insights on AMWL too?
03/22/2021,stocks,"I don't necessarily disagree, but it may see $2000 first."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Maybe, but they tried to take on Etsy a few years back, and got nowhere.  So they don’t always win."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Pretty decent McKenzie report that said telehealth could be $100B addressable market, currently $3.3B and TDOC has about 30% of that."
03/22/2021,stocks,I do
03/22/2021,stocks,Hopefully it sees $1000 so I can buy in.
03/22/2021,stocks,I’d dump all my money in at that price
03/22/2021,stocks,"No matter what, TDOC will still be the leader there’s no way AMZN can compete in telehealth"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I agree with u. TDOC acquired LVGO and that’s why i was holding TDOC in the beginning. Google invested on AMWL and AMZN got their own system. I think the market is ganna be bloody in short term, but the winner will take the whole market"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Well, the scenario I was talking about was possible crash. So you would have a lot of choices of where to dump your money. If no crash, no reason Amazon goes below $2500."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Amazon is an amazing company but it’s just impossible to hyper focus in a million areas.  Anytime they got into a thing (Etsy, Blue Apron, etc), people thought they would win because of their size and distribution costs.  

But if telehealth is the first priority of TDOC’s leadership team, and let’s say just the ninth priority of Andy Jassy’s, I think TDOC wins easily"
03/22/2021,stocks,AMZN and MSFT and hold for 10 years

Bad news for $FUBO?

> **BOSTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2021** The Thornton Law Firm announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of investors of fuboTV Inc. (NYSE:FUBO). The case is currently in the lead plaintiff stage. Investors who purchased FUBO stock or other securities between March 23, 2020 and January 4, 2021.  
>  
> The case alleges that fuboTV and its senior executives made misleading statements to investors which included misrepresentations about fuboTV's ability to grow subscription levels and future profitability, seasonality factors, cost escalations and potentially shrinking addressable market, ability to attract and generate advertising revenue, the Company's valuation, and its prospects of entering the arena of online sports wagering. Investors learned the truth when a series of research reports revealed that: (i) fuboTV's growth in subscriber and profitability was unsustainable past the one-time seasonal surge; (ii) fuboTV's offering of products would be subject to cost escalation; (iii) fuboTV could not successfully compete and perform as sports book operator and could not capitalize on its online sports wagering opportunity; (iv) fuboTV's data and inventory was not differentiated to allow fuboTV to achieve its long-term advertising growth goals; (v) fuboTV's valuation was overstated in light of its total revenue and subscription levels; and (vi) the acquisition of Balto Sports did not provide the stated synergies and internal expertise, and did not expand the Company's addressable market into sports wagering."
03/22/2021,stocks,Don’t know anything about the stock but you should know these lawsuits are a dime a dozen. There are law firms devoted to doing nothing more than trolling for class action lawsuits against any company that drops in stock price. You can find these for almost any ticker.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I feel like this company resembles ROKU so much, one thing to consider is the amount of streaming hours which what really made ROKU take off...if FUBO can manage to increase customer streaming hours AND rollout their sports betting we're in good shaper. I missed out on the ROKU run and I won't miss out with FUBO. 

&#x200B;

LONG FUBO!"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Disclaimer: I have 20% in Fubo with 20% loss so far. 

So my opinion is that it doesnt necessarily hurt FUBO as this kind of class action lawsuits can be virtually found on every stock. Rather, I am paying more attention on Fubo's willing to how much they can go into sports betting and how aggressively they will expand the client pools. 

Those are my two crucial criteria whether or not I will have to eat loss or keep going with this stock. It's like early day ROKU or NFLX, so it's high risk and high return. 

Sure, it can go down, but stocks can also go up sometimes. My exit plan is to find resistance around 26 and load more and sell to minimize my loss."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Lol this happens every time a hyper growth stock gets cut down. Nothing to see here, however probably would be better suited elsewhere for short term gains."

I was a securities class action attorney for some years.  Rarely do such lawsuits have an effect on the company or the stock.  Some are bogus and nothing more than allegations.  Even if the company has to payout, insurance sometimes covers it.   As an investor, you should ignore such lawsuits unless a serious legal analyst writes an article stating it's a problem."
03/22/2021,stocks,Pretty sure this lawsuit was talked about a few weeks before. I saw an article from Yahoo finance on like Mar 5.

2021-03-22 05:56:31,stocks,"My thoughts on Lordstown motors (ride) Don't own a position currently but thinking of starting a position early next week. 


Here are some of my thoughts... 


First I started looking for my usual Red flags when screening tickers...


-Insider selling has not occurred since Early February. 


-Healthy cashflow 


-Good average trading volume 


Now what they do?

About Lordstown Motors Corp.

Lordstown Motors Corp. is an Ohio-based original equipment manufacturer of light duty fleet vehicles, founded by CEO Steve Burns with the purpose of transforming Ohio's Mahoning Valley and Lordstown, Ohio, into the epicenter of electric-vehicle manufacturing. The company owns the 785 acre, 6.2 million square foot Lordstown Assembly Plant where it plans to build the Lordstown Endurance, believed to be the world's first full-size, all-electric pickup truck designed to serve the commercial fleet market. -Copy and pasted off the companies 8k filing. 


The production facility is second largest in the EV space outpaced by only Tesla. They have started production for the first EV truck in the world. 


-Partnership with General Motors 


Market cap is 2.23 billion


Two recent anaylist estimates, which took place after the CEO had his Halloween costume contest on CNBC 


Their 12 month predictions are $40 (downgraded from $50 previously) and $26 (couldn't find prior estimates) 


Overall low estimates average at $18 a share with the lowest I could find at $12 a share. Many of these it should be noted have not been revised recently. 


The drama recently doesn't interest me much especially as many companies have been known to exaggerate numbers to impress investors. I remember Tesla saying they had  non-binding  pre orders of 90,000 CyberSemi's and had a good laugh. The 100,000 from Ride where non binding agreements from what I understand, even if 1/5th of those numbers come to fruition it still represents a very healthy start for the company. It's actually pretty nice to see the SEC finally do something for a change. 


The negative sentiment recently doesn't affect the company negatively in terms of anything fundamental such as bad earnings, production problems, faulty prototypes etc... It's rather a Short term PR crisis handled poorly in my opinion.


Attached is a picture of some short interest estimates. From what I can see most short positions have been closed with very few additions having been added as of now. I suspect some of the smart money may now turn the tables and go long but that's just speculation. 


There are plenty of places to put your money if the electric vehicle market is to really take off. The issue as of late is the rediculous premium investors have to pay with Absurd PE multiples (NIO has a PE ratio of -619 YIKES, where as Ride pre revenue is sitting at -9.64). Cathie woods recent price targets for Tesla for example highlights the absurdly large expectations investors have for companies that are still in their infancy. It is of my opinion that RIDE represents a great opportunity due to having it's own nieche in this competitive market, while having a price that's reasonable given it's pre revenue stage. For me the stock is currently oversold and represents good upside potential for little risk. 


Technical analysis still shows potential for downside as the price is very close to the $13 a share buy wall. I will be exercising patience on my entry and wait for a confirmation on the $13 sell wall to avoid a bull trap before Investing. I plan on investing 7.5k on shares to start and then averaging up when the stock has settled between a future range comfortably. I may add leaps at that point as well given an attractive entry point and positive sentiment moving forward. 


My exit strategy is a stop loss at $12.20 a share which gives time for the stock to quickly recover if the first buying wall is broken. My exit strategy on the upside is to sell half at $18 a share and hold the rest for the following 6-12 months. Anything above $30 a share before 6 months will signal to me it's overbought and I will exit then. 


My year long price target is $28 a share. 


Comparing RIDE to NKLA 2.23 billion vs 6.044 billion I find Ride to be undervalued and I prefer Ride over NKLA especially when looking at the insider selling of both companies over the last 3 months. NKLA had their own dumpster fire of PR in the past and in my eyes that anyalsis is correct. They are not going to be in production until 2023 with many models not available until 2024. Production in Ride has already begun! 


To conclude this may represent one of the last opportunites to get into a very hot industry at a reasonable price point. The CEO doesn't exactly inspire confidence like Elon Musk does, however his work so far is admirable and let's hope to god he can improve his public image in the near future. Other then this I am having a difficult time finding a Bear thesis. It should be noted that investing in a company like this is really no different the investing in a Spacasourous rex, and is highly speculative. Normally I would love to wait on this type of play until I have some actual numbers to work with and a company that proves it can be successful consistently. However when these conditions do eventually get met you are paying a premium on a PE multiple that begins to get reminiscent of the .com bubble. Hence usually a better choice to not get involved at all.

Excerpt:

> Volkswagen (VLKAF) went even further on Tuesday, saying it would sell more than 2 million electric vehicles by 2025, hire 6,500 coding experts over the next five years, launch its own operating system and become Europe's second biggest software company behind SAP (SAP).

> It was quite the flurry of announcements, and it resonated with investors: Volkswagen's main shares in Frankfurt increased by nearly 20% last week, bringing its 2021 gains to 45%. Meanwhile its less-liquid ordinary shares are up 65%, even with a sharp decline on Friday.

Also:

> But Volkswagen is now becoming more like Tesla in the ways that investors care about most. Tesla could be matched sale-for-sale by Volkswagen as early as 2022, according to analysts at UBS, who predict the owner of Audi and Porsche will go on to sell 300,000 more electric vehicles than Tesla in 2025.

Continued:

> Diess is even behaving a bit more like Musk. The German CEO has joined Twitter, and his presentations to investors and the media are starting to have a very ""tech startup"" feel to them, with slickly designed decks.

And:

> ""We have more confidence than ever that Volkswagen will deliver the unique combination of volume growth, making them the world's largest [electric] carmaker, together with Tesla, as soon as next year,"" UBS analyst Patrick Hummel said recently, ""while their margins will be stable or even grow from here.

03/22/2021,stocks,The price when originally issued is your capital. Any sale above that is gains.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Seen as no gain. You also probably have to pay taxes at time of vesting. Make sure your etrade is set up to handle the shares the way you want regarding taxes. If you have 1 share, it might sell the share to pay taxes and give you the rest. If you have 2 it might sell one and cover that with taxes.

03/22/2021,stocks,"When they drop into ur e trade account thats the amount you gained.  For example, you get 10 shares of stock worth $100 each, thats a capital gain of $1000, no matter if you sell or not."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Your company usually holds back a portion of the shares of the RSUs to pay taxes.  RSUs are taxed at the same rate as normal income.  

If the stock price per share is more than when they were issued to you, you have to pay tax on those gains at the end of year when you file, if it’s worth less you get money back because you paid taxes at the price they were issued at."

03/22/2021,stocks,Thank you!
03/22/2021,stocks,"This is the answer.

If a company buys back shares, market cap will drop, price remains the same. A company chronically buying back shares might look like it isn't ""doing well""

Same goes in reverse -- if a company issues shares, market cap will go up even though price doesn't (or even goes down).

And as the other guy posted, a lot of places you can graph based on market cap instead of share price."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Interesting. Lets see:
Based on the sentiments, that issuing is watering down and buyback is condensing:
Issuing is perceived as watering down each share which would lead to drop in share-price and market cap, market cap would stay the same. 
Buying back is perceived as condensing, which would drive the price per share up and keeping the market cap equalized. 

At least this is what I would assume. Fundamental analysis usually relies on p/e comparison with other companies. eps is viewed in relation to the shares, but could be misleading due to it´s relation to shares outstanding. 
So p/e would tell me more about a company, than eps. I do not view the amount of shares as an important metric. 

Also why would you think, a company buying back shares might make it look like it isn´t doing well. They might have a strong balance sheet and have no means to meaningfully invest in their business. (This could mean they have maxed out their business model and marketing and business is stagnant.. okay I get that). It could also be driven by external factors, such as cheap money, such as central bank printers going brrr. So looking at the balance sheet would be in order to finally judge, but yeah, could be an indicator to look into. 
Issuing shares might be perceived as a strong signal to add liquidity to execute on a vision / strategy. But could also be a weak signal , if the board thinks, the price is peaking and they should get liquidity for bad times. 
Hmmm, interesting thought experiment, I am curious what the others or OP will add."
03/22/2021,stocks,"In a perfect market, buying back or issuing shares should not move the stock price (in reality it is sentiment about why they are buying back / issuing that moves it).

> Also why would you think, a company buying back shares might make it look like it isn´t doing well

When buying back stock, cash in the balance sheet is removed. This lowers market cap. I'm not saying it looks bad for someone who's paying attention to what's going on. It just looks bad if you just look at a market cap chart."
2021-03-22 04:57:33,stocks,"Asia - Monday Open So Nikkei 225 started in the red, and is still sloping downward.

Tech 100 futures, however, are looking good.

I don't base too much on Nikkei, but am very interested to see how Taiwan and Hong Kong start the week. Those markets will start opening in just over 30m.

A few key thoughts I'm having:

1. I need to be ready to hedge for any loss that may be incurred by my tech-heavy portfolio, should there be a major shift in that sector (invested heavily in what I believe to be the bottom)

2.1 Will the upswing in oil Friday spill into this week? The Saudi's said Friday's attacks did not impact production, however that's basically what I would expect of them to say. But, then again, it's Aramco and it's capable of immense output to make up for the temporary disruption

2.2 Saudi's made an attack against Houthi rebel's, will there be some sort of retaliation this week? Could be worthwhile to have a put/call strategy in place -definitely worthwhile unless oil trades sideways

3. Qualcomm CEO had positive remarks with regard to the chip shortage... QUAL reached what I believe to be a bottom, and is one of the blue-chip stocks of the tech world. Would a play on QUAL be better than a play in AMD? Probably safer... Or would something like SOXL calls be better given the possibility of supply catching up to demand in the near term? 

These are the thoughts circling my head right now. Please feel free to contribute any thoughts, criticism, or ideas."

I’m sure there are many investors here that are not from the US. I was wondering if adopting a strategy heavily focused on dividend stocks as opposed growth stocks would be a wise approach to the market as someone who is not a US citizen. 

I am from a country that does not have any income tax. So basically what I make is what I get to take home at the end of the day. So any capital gains I make in the market, I would get to keep 100%. However, and dividend payouts I receive will be subject to a 30% tax withholding even if I reinvest it into the market.

From this perspective, wouldn’t growth stocks be a no brainer? I know dividend stocks also experience growth but at a slower rate. 

I’d love to hear your opinion on this.

Thanks!

Edit: thanks guys for the responses. It seems everyone here agrees that I should be avoiding dividend for the reasons i mentioned above.

For those who asked, I am from Kuwait. We don’t pay taxes here but were far from perfect."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Avoid dividend stocks. You need to pay 30% withholding tax on the dividends. Growth stocks with good management will channel cash back into the company to fuel further growth, instead of paying out dividends. Otherwise, in absence of growth opportunities, they buy back stock to boost share value. In other words, they reinvest the dividends for you. This way, you avoid being taxed on the 30% withholding tax and also get good growth from the company."

$EGP  - Beautiful up trend but I am not shocked to say that it may die to $131 which would honestly be better. But this is a low risk play here.

&#x200B;

$FLXN - what a sexual set up. Low risk, high reward, price targets are sky high -- I mean.... lord I like it a lot.

&#x200B;

$LAMR - Up trend is obvious and a great bounce off of the 50EMA here. May be burnt out, if it dips down to like $83 I won't be too upset.

&#x200B;

$LSI  - Amazing up trend and support area. Love it, live it, watch it. This can be a great set up.

&#x200B;

$NKE  - Possible STRONG support is near $130, but this is a still a safe bet given the up trend. It did have earnings so let's see where it heads - do not get hasty.

&#x200B;

$NLS  - Up trend is nice here, support is nice, I really love this play long term. This bad boy may make some massive moves.

&#x200B;

$PGEN - I think it can be lower, possible under $7.90 if it dips farther. I like this play long term as well.

$PLNT - Up trend is suuuuuper obvious. Support is obvious, this is a REALLY easy play to read and watch.

So I went to [https://www.similarweb.com/](https://www.similarweb.com/) to see the traffic history comparing the two sites, and there are some major differences.

Looking at some  Engagement basics for February:

Total Visits:  DraftKings- 12.35M     PNGaming- 112.49K

This is huge.  PENN really doesn't even show up on the graph comparing the two.

Avg. Visit duration: DraftKings- 13:19       PNGaming- 01:06

DKNG is longer than the average YouTube video, while PENN shows people are visiting and leaving faster than it probably took you to read this far.

Pages per Visit: DraftKings-  9.13             PNGaming-  2.52

That means that not only are they visiting the site, there visiting way more pages of the site than just the home page and maybe a few random clicks.  There's a lot more on the page, but decided to focus on just this part.  If anyone has anymore input, would love to hear it.

In what could be the most important decade for sports betting history, DKNG is already ahead in the states that don’t allow sports betting.

What reason does anyone have to go to PENN's website? compared to DKNG (can I bet thru the browser with DKNG or do I need the app?). PENN was a billion dollar a year business before mobile & online gaming was a major factor, in fact before DKNG even existed, so my only point here is that we could probably infer that the company is taking in a nice chunk of change from their physical properties, they've got ~40 of them. Rather than asking about website metrics, I'd be looking at exposure to different sides of the business vs current valuation and where you see more potential. just my 2 cents.

03/22/2021,stocks,The Barstool Sportsbook is relatively new. A lot of PENN assets are physical properties that you probably have heard of if you are remotely familiar with casino properties. This is basically the point of the discussion.
03/22/2021,stocks,Yeah i know just this year many more states have opted for legalization which is a huge plus. I think PENN hitting the S&P is gonna skyrocket it (assuming we dont have another crazy sell off day with high yield rates... thoughts draftkings has been up during those days before too). Im debating if its even worth jumping into monday. It should historically have a huge profit sell off after this week or next. Most newly listed sky rocket before stabilizing. 52 week high is $140... currently at $118 (after a red day). Id definitely look to buy under $120. But if buy the rumors sell the news holds true... tomorrow very well could be a huge sell off too. Be interesting to watch. Its down 10% in the last week.
03/22/2021,stocks,Ohhhh
03/22/2021,stocks,"Having patience sucks, but I don't think legalization news is coming anytime soon since I haven't heard any solid rumors.  Waiting for prices to stabilize shouldn't be an issue."

2021-03-22 02:17:57,stocks,"Bloomberg Article on Volkswagen: Implications for Reverse Merger Startups I already posted my [DD on proper valuation for the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ma2gyz/dd_valuation_of_the_next_tesla_grossly/).

However, this Bloomberg article caught my attention, because it also implies that Volkswagen has answers in the works for certain reverse merger startups in the EV space:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/vw-plans-europe-s-biggest-battery-push-in-electric-offensive

> Fast-charging in Europe will grow five-fold to 18,000 stations, helped by cooperations with BP Plc in the U.K., Iberdrola SA in Spain and Enel SpA in Italy. In North America, VW is adding 3,500 stations this year and 17,000 points in China by 2025.

Volkswagen is not taking the likes of EVGo lightly.

> VW will offer bidirectional charging from 2022, a move that would change the way power grids operate by allowing car batteries to store excess energy and feed it back to the network in times of peak demand.

Volkswagen is not taking the likes of Nuvve Corporation or Proterra lightly."
03/22/2021,stocks,(Pinging u/NoMathematician7932)

2021-03-22 01:48:26,stocks,"Does the fear of inflation affect in which currency you want to own your stock? There's a lot of talk about how the US will be hit by inflation considering how much money was printed in 2020. I'm assuming that will lead to the US dollar becoming weaker in comparison to other currencies. 

Doesn't that mean that now is a great time to buy stocks in Euro or Yen? If the dollar becomes weaker, those stocks will be worth a lot more dollars in the future even if the cost in Euro or Yen is the same. But if they also grow in value, it's win-win?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I’m pretty bearish right now, but I’m still adding to my index funds and long stocks. I believe in America, just not the federal reserve.
If I had a shitload of money and was really scared I’d dump everything into the FTSE 100, buy a castle, and become a vampire."
03/22/2021,stocks,"So, when you look at ECB and their (almost identical) version of QE in Europe, what makes you think the Euro is not also headed the same inflationary way?

In fact, I'd say that the Euro system QE is even worse than the FED virtually printing money and handing it out to you guys on a way more underlying, devastating level long term. Too much to go into here.

I think you shouldn't see stock as an inflationary hedge in the currency sense, but in the intrinsic underlying value sense instead and not worry about currency inflation on top of stock valuation movements.

TL;DR:

I wouldn't hedge USD inflation with EUR - nor stocks valued in these currencies, if my goal were ""inflation hedge"". Stocks are assets and appreciate inflation by their pricing. Owning stocks is already in part a hedge on inflation, if you have the right value stocks, that is."
03/22/2021,stocks,"You’ve only identified one side of inflation - the increase in supply of money, have you considered the other side - the demand for the us dollar - and whether that has a counter affect on inflation with reference to increase in supply"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I’m not gonna tell people what to do or how to invest, but I think fears of inflation are way overblown and most arguments pushing it just aren’t sound.

The US will raise taxes to pay down some debt, the Fed can raise rates if they need to, banks are sitting on higher reserve requirements than they were in 08 and very few economists are predicting any sort of sustained inflation, let alone a runaway/hyperinflation scenario.

If anything, I’d be worried what happens when all of the economic relief cuts off in September. If society isn’t reopened by then, there are going to be a lot of people struggling to pay loans.

Every few years, there’s another, “omg the dollar is going to collapse,” panic within some circles, and yet it doesn’t happen. There are people who benefit from this narrative, and people for whom it’s politically convenient to believe that the big bad Democrats are going to tank the economy any day now."
03/22/2021,stocks,"There's risk related to each countries currency. You would need to find the risk free rate of the currency you are dealing with and make your investments based on that. Outside of places like canada, US , currency flucutations are very common.

If you are very worried about this but don't have a great deal of grasp in global currencies like most people, just buy an index fund that tracks the foreign market. The nflation fear from my understanding tho is global so ... best to look into like commodities  / REITs or something if that's ur play."
03/22/2021,stocks,"If the currency is depreciating then companies should get 10% more expensive every year. They're the ones increasing revenue by raising prices that much. If they're not gaining enough in stock price, then what you have is a recession that's being hidden by inflation."

03/22/2021,stocks,"The Fed won't go negative. They're letting the bond and mortgage markets raise rates for them^(1). Banks can tighten loans and make a ton of money on the vig, to replenish their reserves after a year of 0% reserve requirement. That will soak up the new cash, and when banks are full the Fed will start to tighten up, too, maybe sell off some of the assets bought in the emergency, to soak up cash as the economy starts to drive itself again.

^(1) - Gov and commercial bond rates in have been rising since August and bank rates since the start of the year."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Gold/silver ratio in the earth is around 10ish to 1 current paper gold silver ratio is around 70 to 1 if they were to match what is actually in the earth and what has been mined trough history silver should have a price around 150-200 an ounce.

I'd actually say more people prefer gold to silver as it's been the traditional inflation hedge play."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I personally don’t see negative rate either. It’s Scott Minerd’s opinion and makes sense if you check it out. Scott mentioned on the interview, historically, every recession there are temp inflation hike, and goes below the 2% inflation target. That’s why Scott Minerd thinks - rate is possible so people stop saving money and spend money and circulate the M2 faster rate . But, as you mentioned, i agree with u. I don’t think US ever go to negative rate.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Europoor here, kinda used to negative rates by now."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Not more scarce just undervalued compared to gold at least with the amount we pull out of the ground currently.

Just look at the premiums on silver right now in order to get physical silver you have to pay almost a 20% premium even for the most mundane form factor."

I used to live in Korea, similar thing happening right now, but bank pays little over 1% for interest. Stocks were flat till pandemic and everyone were investing in Real estates.

I live in Chicago, US now and bank pays 0.01% on savings acc 😂 i found some other low key banks that pays 1%, but still it’s a joke. 
Real estate is regulated with crazy property tax here, 2.3% :(

2021-03-22 01:43:48,stocks,"BMO - Bank if Montreal. Anyone holding it? Hi. I have been looking at BMO as a potential growth stock with some nice dividend. It is relatively cheap compared to many others and Canadian banks have always been quite safe. 

The money I would be allocating to it would be about 15% of my Roth and otherwise would go to either VOO (which I have a ton of) or SCHD (which I am considering but haven’t started a position yet)

I don’t need dividends but I will take it if they are associated with a nice growth potential. 

Anything you guys can share with me that may sway me one way or another?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"It's an ""ok"" stock, but definitely one of the Canadian bank laggards - in fact, from March 2017 to March 2021, the stock is barely up +10% in total (excluding dividends).  That is a pathetic return no matter how you slice it or dice it.  There is something to be said that bank laggards eventually catch up, but BMO has been a dud for quite a while now."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I’ve owned it for more than 5 years.  Royal, TD and even National Bank have all out performed BMO by at least two times.  It’s had a pop recently so I’m hoping it starts to catch up at this point."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I can't comment on the stock but as a Canadian who has used several banks and credit unions over the years, BMO was by far the worst one to deal with."
03/22/2021,stocks,It is at the top of the stock screener I use because it is undervalued. Why I haven't bought it is because I prefer a stock trading toward at the lower end of its range instead of trading at all time highs so there is wiggle room for the stock to go up.
03/22/2021,stocks,Good for the dividend but I bought in around April. I'd be hard-pressed to buy in now at this price.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Canadian Banks are so good when you are starting to approach retirement. I try to allocate just 5% on these stocks (RY, BMO) right now cause im just 25 yo but Im gonna increase that percentage as I grow older. when im 55 I would want 50-60% in Candian banks (might add some CNR)"

03/22/2021,stocks,"As a programmer/IT-guy I can tell you most 'cybersecurity' is just snake oil software and a lot of marketing buzzwords.

The company itself who has data is responsible for the 'cybersecurity'. No third party 'cybrersecurity' will have any meaningful impact. For example Facebook is responsible for the security of Facebook.

So if you still want to invest, then pick the one with the nicest buzzwords and sell once you made a good profit.

Most of the suggestions here are also not really about 'cybersecurity'. For example Cloudflare and Crowdstrike are more about availability rather than security."

Every tech companies have their own cyber-security departments and pay really good money to those experts at their firm.

The reason that company as a whole will not have that much value is simple. Its because each every big tech/IT companies have their own cyber-security teams that are simply better than cyber-security company.

Hacking is happening everyday and threat is everywhere. The cyber-security companies simply cannot stop all of them. That's why company like Google, Facebook, Twitter, MS, and Apple have the best cyber-security departments in the world because they take he threat seriously and invest much more money than cyber-security companies. That is the reason the cyber-security companies are more focused on creating a software that scan and protect the computer from viruses and malware.

If you really wanted to protect your system or information or network, then get a team made out of security experts like vulnerability assessor, security engineer, cryptographer, security analysts, and penetration testers."

The two oil companies said the proposals looked to micromanage their operations but the SEC said it was “unable to concur” with this argument, the FT reported.

All you need is activist investors demanding a vote on the issue, and MRO has no advantage.

2021-03-22 01:00:34,stocks,"Stocks/ETFs trading <$10/share that AREN'T pure speculation Like many new, financially-limited investors, I was drawn to so-called ""penny stocks"" when I first started trading. You mean, instead of buying 0.8 shares of AAPL with this $100 I scraped together, I can buy 70-80 shares of some company that will *totally be the next (insert top company in the sector)?!* Sign me up!

However, for many reasons, penny stocks can be a huge gamble, especially when you're dealing with purely speculative, pre-revenue companies, and of course all the issues that can arise from SPACs that often bring these upstarts to the stock market.

Lately, I have been trying to find some actually solid stocks/ETFs trading for less than $10/share (or in that ballpark) as an attempt  to leverage my limited capital a little bit more. I'm looking for cheap but profitable and structurally-solid investments, both for myself and to help steer other new investors away from risky penny stocks and the like.

I've selected a few--two individual stocks and one ETF--that could be good picks at this price point. I would also like to note that I do not have ANY positions on these currently.



* **ADT (ADT) - $7.95 3/19@close**: Not much I need to tell you here, as you have most likely heard of home security giant ADT. Granted, their market share has been reduced pretty drastically by the movement toward IoT, decentralized solutions like Ring and Vivint, but ADT is still a leader in the industry. On 2/25, they reported 2020 earnings, which were slightly down from 2019, going from a $2.438B adjusted EBITDA to $2.199B. However, it seems likely the pandemic hit the home security business pretty hard, as they likely saw a reduction in new installations and possibly cancellations from people who were stuck at home and had limited need for a security system. They have also announced partnerships with DISH Networks and Alphabet, the latter investing $450MM, to help close the gap between ADT and its more techy competitors. Slightly high debt aside, their 8.56 forward P/E, 5.95 P/FCF, and consensus target of $10.53 make ADT an intriguing, affordable stock with decent growth potential.

* **Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC) - $6.92 3/19@close**: KGC is a Toronto-based gold mining corporation with mines in Canada, USA, Russia, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, and Mauritania. Now, I will admit straight-up that I don't know enough about the gold or mining industries to analyze much of note about the company's operations, but I can tell you this: they have *solid gold* financials! P/E and forward P/E under 10? Check! P/B under 2? Check! Debt/equity of only 0.3? Check! Target price almost double where it's trading now? Check, check, check! If you're looking to hop aboard the supposed gold boom that might be coming, this is probably the safest way to do it outside of an ETF.

* **Invesco S&P SmallCap Energy ETF (PSCE) - $6.63 3/19@close**: Energy took a hit recently, but it should mount an easy comeback in the coming months. This ETF is a great way to not only capitalize on the recent small cap boom, but also to have a wide array of energy-related holdings of all sorts. I don't know much about their top holdings, except for REGI (which I am long on with a few shares separately), but I trust Invesco to manage all their funds extremely well. Performance-wise, the fund has one of the lower P/Es in the sector, and had the highest YTD return of any non-leveraged energy ETF (according to ETFDB).

2021-03-22 00:58:20,stocks,"Is Elon a bit overoptimistic? I've been seriously looking into FSD from Tesla for the last couple of days. My point here is not to compare it with other systems, nor do I want to discuss which technology would be best suited here. I refer here to the latest videos from the YouTube ""AI Addict"". I can't link the videos directly because reddit thinks it's spam.

I'm honestly very negatively surprised how badly the system works in slightly more complicated situations, but well, those are the difficult cases. However, I find it problematic that in some cases **normal maneuvers are dangerous**. Even on completely harmless curves, the car sometimes pulls into another lane or cuts a car severely.

The drivers have to **intervene about 20 times in this 30-minute drive**, sometimes even to prevent accidents. **And there's the problem: at Level 5 (which Elon says could come as early as the end of the year), it has to work so well that there's never a need to intervene. Because at level 5, it has to work without the steering wheel and the driver's attention**. And yes, Tesla is collecting a lot of data and working on it. But as long as you would have to intervene at least 1 time on 100 000 miles, **it is once too much**. And I think we will need a very long time to get there.

(And yes, some of these videos portray FSD better than it is, and some intentionally worse. I really tried to find ""average"" videos from the last 2 weeks.)"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Elon is borderline insane. 

I mean that in the best way. it can take an obsessive, insane streak to do great things. musicians practicing guitar for 12 hours a day, things like that.

03/22/2021,stocks,"I don't drive log enough distances to take advantage of FSD so I don't buy it. FSD gets so much attention that everyone forgets about autopilot. NY to Raleigh and I didn't touch the brake once on the highway. You basically never use the brake because of regen. 

I don't need to set records- I am happy enough to put on AP and set my distance to 4 car lengths and rest my hand on the steering wheel. It greatly reduces driver fatigue because you aren't making thousands of gas/brake/steering adjustments. 

On thing that's fun (sarcasm) is the occasional phantom braking. The AP thinks it sees something and slows you down really fast. Please don't tailgate a Tesla; you might get unintentionally brake checked. This has happened 4 times to me in 8k miles - it's very infrequent."
03/22/2021,stocks,"There’s one thing we need to consider:
Elon is a tech preacher. And as much as he stays in the news, and as people idealises him, his work and himself will be that valuable. It doesn’t matter what he says per se. What matters is His public persona.

Think of all the people who loves Elon and goes to buy a Tesla. I think this is why he’s so active on Twitter as well."

03/22/2021,stocks,You need to read into neural nets - that’s why Elon is so ambitious. The rate of progress is on an S curve - the rate of progress on FSD over the next year is going to be exponential/unprecedented - then the following year with Tesla Dono up and running - job is done.
03/22/2021,stocks,"A few things to keep in mind:

* The FSD software currently still requires drivers to confirm certain actions by scrolling a button or tugging the wheel. You may perceive this as an intervention, but it's not.
* Driving in cities is extremely difficult. Highways are a lot easier. Level 5 requires any kind of driving to be perfect, but robotaxis may be possible before that point.
* Tesla's data is increasing exponentially through higher FSD adoption rates and increasing car sales while existing cars keep gathering data.
* Tesla is building the most powerful supercomputer in the world to help train the AI, but this will only start operations later this year.

It's definitely still a while away, and Musk is always using more aggressive timelines to push his team to finish it as fast as possible, but it's quite likely to happen before the second half of this decade. Also keep in mind that until then, Tesla cars with FSD engaged already have significantly fewer accidents than regular cars (1 accident per 4,5 million miles compared to the US average of 480.000 miles), so it's already valuable technology.

EDIT: Ah only just noticed OPs username. Guess I wasted my time writing this. This guy has a vendetta against Tesla, guess he's just feigning interest to spread more misinformation... =\"
03/22/2021,stocks,Elon is a clown.
03/22/2021,stocks,"It’s one of those things that the more it’s used the faster it improves as the velocity of data collection increases. And I think the video you are referring to is one where the driver is in a city, which makes sense that it sucks because most tests were in rural/suburban areas and not densely populated areas. If you look at the first FSD videos vs current there is a large improvement IMO (obv excluding the city video), so it’s just a matter of time before it learns how to navigate safely and effectively. Now Elon does like to get a bit crazy with his timelines, but do I think that we will see it faster than we expect. Gotta remember, it’s not just Tesla that’s trying to do this, so it’s not like it isn’t going to happen ever, it’s just a matter of who can do it the quickest and the safest. I think regulation concerns will dissipate once people realize it will eventually be safer than human drivers because a machine doesn’t get distracted, drive under the influence, or get tired."
03/22/2021,stocks,There is a reason why phrase 'Elon time' is used a lot.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Elon as tesla's ceo is selling his company so ofc it will be over optimistic. In the same light Ark funds are heavily invested in tesla so their valuations will be somewhat biased.

I don't see Tesla being the company to crack FSD (level 5). Its very concerning to me to see places like Waymo and Aurora be all on board with Lidars for instance and for Elon to disregard it. That being said tesla has a lot of data so compared to other automotive autonomous projects (GM?) I will assume there's will be better."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I agree with Ark's analysis - there is about 50% chance we will have Level 5 autonomous vehicles made by Tesla by 2025. It's not guaranteed but the rate of progress has been accelerating quickly due to the nature of machine learning, so there is a big chance we will get there soon. Obviously it's not there yet"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I read his biography, and the journalist who wrote the book mentions the first time they met for lunch. At the end of the talk, as the journalist writes down, Elon asks “ do you think I’m insane?” Sums things up pretty well.

Maybe robotaxi is far off, but if it’s good enough that you can take over on a long commute or prevent accidents from sleep deprived long haul trucks that’s still really incredible."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Point 3 is probably why I don’t think Tesla can do it, ML is actually not great with large training datasets, because it ends up with a greater amount of irrelevant attributes, a focus on attributes that may not be as important in every situation, and makes the model less general and less adaptable (also larger and takes more processing power). It would’ve been much better to have a small amount of highly experienced drivers to collect data from, or train specific situations through a simulator. I guess time will tell if they’ve developed a good way to cull bad training data and trim their model."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Haha, I said this before. It's entirely possible."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Fair point, but wouldn't the supercomputer help with this as well?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"The issue is not with error tolerance.  There is moral/ethics issue when it comes to self driving cars, which have to be programmed by people. It’s old Trolley problem: kill one person or kill 5 people. 

Then we will need new laws to allow cars to drive them selfs and new insurance policies. 

You can solve all the errors in programming, but we are back to the Trolley Problem."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I still think that fear goes back to control. If the statistics are as op said a car accident is fatal for everyone and 107 car accidents, and it's fatal in a plane every one in a million.. you are more comfortable with your higher risk fatality in a car because you feel more in control and feel like you could prevent it from being a fatal mistake."
03/22/2021,stocks,"That's not true! According to the US National Transportation Safety Board, 95.7% of people survive plane crashes. It's safer than perceived..

Edit: After doing more research that statistic is BS. The Stat uses the term accident instead and to the NTSB an accident is not equivalent to a crash. So I think your fear is justified until better stats can be found"
03/22/2021,stocks,Doesn't matter ... Someone else is in control.. meaning they no longer have control over what happens.

I do not know my pilot in an airliner. I do not know the maintainers. I do not know any information about the plane except what I feel in the chair. I cannot see the bits or have any input on the safety of us flying. I don’t know what the company has deemed ‘good enough’ for flying in this aircraft. It is a closed system, and I am mere profit and weight.

Self-driving cars are still my car. I take it for maintenance and I ride it back from the shop: I can still read the lights and notifications. I’m still sitting in front and can control it to a degree. Planes have no such luxury. Buses, at least, are tall and tanky so that a collision will probably keep me safer than the other guy: unless there’s a low bridge and a sleepy driver."

2021-03-21 23:16:13,stocks,"IPO: Databricks First time post to this sub, but long time lurker, even before I had a Reddit account. 

Recently I’ve been interested in putting aside some money to drop on an IPO later this year for a company that I felt had great potential. After looking around I found Databricks and thought I would share it and simultaneously gather opinions on this from those who know much more than I do.

Before I start I want to make two things very clear:

1. **This is not financial advice, nor am I a financial advisor.**

2. **Databricks, as of this moment, has not filed for an IPO.** I simply believe they will later this year and am being proactive in preparation for one.


So for those who don’t already know, Databricks is a artificial intelligence and data company that was founded in 2013 by some CS students at Berkeley. These same students also founded Apache Spark, an open-source analytics engine used to process data on a large scale. Databricks is basically a way to commercialize the Apache Spark software for enterprises. 

Databricks has had multiple rounds of funding, and the last three rounds raises substantially more each time. See below for funding rounds:

2013- 13.9 Million

2014- 33 Million

2016- 60 Million

2017- 140 Million

Feb. 2019- 250 Million

Oct. 2019- 400 Million

Jan. 2021- 1 Billion

The latest round of funding puts the companies **valuation at an impressive 28 Billion.** The two funding rounds in 2019 were lead by Andreessen Horowitz and the 2021 round was lead by Franklin Templeton Investments. Databricks also has multiple other “big name” investors such as Fidelity, Microsoft, Blackrock, and Sales Force Ventures which, for me atleast, shows some promise for their future. 

Databricks also has a decent customer base or their services, boasting companies such as Shell, Comcast, T-Mobile, and CVS Health. 

An important point for me is they essentially pioneered the idea of using “lakehouse” architecture in the cloud. After all, we are talking about a cloud start up that is **backed by all the major players in the cloud computing industry (Amazon Web Services, CapitalG, Microsoft, and Sales Force).** This hints to the possibility that they could be a leader in the future of cloud computing, which in and of itself, is the future of our world’s technology.

Databricks also recently passed 425 Million in Annual Recurring Revenue, **a 75% growth year over year. **

Databricks CEO, Ali Ghodsi, also has made very clear that they have left some valuation on the table in every round of funding, saying they could have easily reached a 35 Billion valuation. His reasoning for doing this it seems is to negate the possibility of them becoming overvalued so that when they eventually do go public they can attract and subsequently retain as many long term investors as possible. 

I know that this is a long read but I wanted to get everything I was thinking out there. I do not now when, or if, they will go public. However, when they do I might strongly consider ordering pre-IPO. 


Thanks for the read, and buy the dip. ✌🏻

03/22/2021,stocks,"Data Engineer here, its not so much an AI company, but big data company. 
Its spun off from open source Spark, which is the most widely used Big Data distributed computing software.

Basically, any problem we ever deal with spark, all the solutions usually come back to Databricks. 

I am gonna invest in it, and I think it's better than Snowflake (though they do two very different things. Databricks can do a lot more than snowflake).

Tbh, I dont get snowflake hype, it can turn out to be good investment.

But managed Spark, that's where it's at, no one wants to have to deal with managing Spark (you would need at least one full time engineer or a team of engineers just to be Spark specialist), and its not worth the pain unless you are a massive company and having it be internal would be cheaper than managed.

My company uses AWS Glue, which is also serverless managed Spark (and mostly because we are vendor locked into AWS, and wouldn't use Databricks to the fullest). But if you are a big Data company, than I bet Databricks is very good in that regard."

I was searching for ETFs to buyers in europe, and noticed that some of the ones following the S&P500 were consistently beating the index over the past 5 years. The tracking difference is large, but it is always positive. Is there any reason for this? Am I reading the numbers wrongly?

Unless you are holding safer things like Coca-Cola or something. That went down to around $36 which I think was a 35-40% drop. QQQ got waxed too but came back. I wish I had the post from where I saw someone who did this over 10 years so they could explain how they would buy. Basically dollar cost averaged and then put in chunks on big dips. He said he put in his entire typical annual allotment in February, March and April of last year and averaged down and up through the dip. He was up over 100% just on those total buys this past year.

And on average, the stocks they buy go on to outperform by about 70 basis points. The problem is, on average, their cost in total far exceed that. So, they end up losing anyway.

2021-03-21 22:14:51,stocks,"DD Valuation of the Next Tesla: Grossly Undervalued bubble stock in the making (VOW3, VWAGY) I'll split this DD valuation on Volkswagen into two parts: the Value Play and the Next Tesla Play.

VOW is the actual European stock ticker.  VWAGY is for American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of VOW.

[Meanwhile, PAH3 is the actual European stock ticker for parent company Porsche, while POAHY is for the American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of PAH3.]

**Value Play**

I can't provide the link to the article, but it is titled ""Volkswagen Is Undervalued And Is Perfectly Positioned For A Cyclical Upturn,"" written by ""The Value Analyst.""

I'll quote this part, though:

> Price to Sales remains at 0.66 and P/E remain at 10. For a company whose long-term growth potential is around 5-6% this stock is modestly priced. Although with similar growth rates many similar stocks trade at a much higher level. Cash flow tends to be a lot more volatile for VW and quite often in the negative due to capital expenditures. In general cash flow is not a good metric for vehicle manufacturers. The current ratio remains around 1.15, and that's quite good for a car maker.

> Overall, the state of finances remains solid, and there is certainly some value in the stock. A conservative DCF that assumes 8% WACC and 5% growth, with a terminal rate of 0%, shows the stock is likely valued at around $42.

Where I differ with that author, of course, is my position that a PT of $42 for VWAGY should apply *only* to Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid businesses.  Of the total auto sales of 9,305,400 units and €222.9 billion, the PT of $42 should apply *only* to 9,073,800 units and sales growth therein.

**Next Tesla Play**

Forget value investing.  Forget problems with being asset-heavy instead of being asset-light (i.e., as opposed to richly valued growth stories in the tech sector).

We want the next bubble play!  We want the Next Tesla!  We want tech valuations!  We want price-to-sales valuations!

[As of March 19, Tesla's price-to-sales ratio is 22.04.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/tsla/tesla/price-sales)

Thus, let's scrutinize the 231,600 EV unit sales for 2020 and [Volkswagen's goal to become the consumer EV market leader by 2025](https://www.barrons.com/articles/this-is-how-long-it-takes-to-become-an-ev-player-51616075163).

The biggest non-Tesla pure play in the consumer EV space, NIO, sold over 43,700 units in 2020 for a [gross margin of 11.5%](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-fourth-quarter-and-full-1).  As of March 19, its price-to-sales multiple is higher than Tesla's, at 26.60, despite not having the latter's cutting-edge battery technology or autonomous driving technology.

Not far behind are Li Auto and Xpeng, which sold approximately 30,000 units and 27,000 units in 2020, respectively.  Their respective gross margins were [16.4%](https://kr-asia.com/ev-maker-li-auto-generates-strong-profits-as-deliveries-surge) and [4.6%](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210308005328/en/XPeng-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2020-Unaudited-Financial-Results).  They trade at similar price-to-sales multiples despite lacking Tesla's cutting-edge battery technology or autonomous driving technology.

Even when combined, these claimants to ""second mover advantage"" sold far less consumer EV units than 231,600 units.  It is clear here that the real second mover is Volkswagen, not these pretenders.

Without further information, a *minimum* monetary estimate of Volkswagen EV revenues in 2020 €5.55 billion: €222.9 billion in total revenue x 231,600 EV unit sales / 9,305,400 total unit sales.  Since EVs are currently more expensive than less clean vehicles, their EV revenues should be noticeably greater.

Every bubble play has a price-to-sales multiple of at least 20.  Therefore, the consumer EV business of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, *should have already been worth at least €111.0 billion last year*.  [Deutsche Bank has recently stated that this particular business should already be worth €195.0 billion.](https://fortune.com/2021/03/22/volkswagen-vw-db-report-ev-business-tesla/)  However, this is a conservative estimate, as the company has beaten its earlier EV unit sales targets, and again because EV are currently more expensive than less clean vehicles.

How much further should this EV-related market cap ""stonk""?

Well, [Volkswagen plans to sell 1 million EVs this very year!](https://www.barrons.com/articles/volkswagen-ev-goals-tesla-stock-51615901639)  If this is realistic, then the consumer EV sales could reach €23.95 billion.  Accordingly, the consumer EV business could be worth up to €479.1 billion.

**EV Economy Matters**

[The Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, has big plans for fast charging and bidirectional charging.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/vw-plans-europe-s-biggest-battery-push-in-electric-offensive)

As of March 19, VWAGY closed at a mere $34.15; Volkswagen's entire business has been valued at a mere €147.4 billion.  The upside to $42 strictly on the value play means that the market cap for Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid business should be €181.2 billion.

The EV top-up of €195.0 billion to €479.1 billion suggests that a more appropriate market value *as of yesterday* should have been €376.2 billion to €660.3 billion.

In other words, **VWAGY should have been trading between $87.16 and $152.98 yesterday, folks!**

The Next Tesla!  Volkswagen!  Das Auto!

*Disclosure: Long POAHY.*"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Nice DD, thanks for sharing!"
03/22/2021,stocks,"The big point you're missing I think is that there's no reason for the BEV-transformed auto makers to have a market cap greater than today's. Electric cars won't make any manufacturer vastly more profitable than they are today in the long term. The only reason Tesla receives a multiple is because they have a lot of other side businesses in the pipeline. 

VW is focusing on transitioning to BEVs in order to survive, they're not going to become a software company over night, same as Sears didn't become a successful online e-commerce sensation

PS: I own two companies in automotive and had quite a lot invested in Tesla between 2019 and 2020.  Valuation way too rich right now for anything EV"
03/22/2021,stocks,Wanted to get into Volkswagen at the start of March. I didn't. Now i have a huge mental blockage because of the price increase.
03/22/2021,stocks,"I think it is fairly undervalued.

My opinion is obviously different from yours. I don't claim my opinions to be right. I just have strong opinion. I don't mind if you disagree. 

Technological disparity between Tesla and other companies in the industry is huge.

Tesla took a risk and financial losses to invest and develop their current technology.

Tesla is a leading company in automation and EV industry because of their technological superiority over their competitors.

It would at least take a decade for other players to catch up with Tesla's technological advancement. That assumption is based on hypothesis of other companies investing large % of their capitals to developing the technology for automation and EV.

Technological advancement and development require time, and money. Tesla invest their time and money despite of financial loss. I doubt that other players in the industry can catch up to them.

Volkswagen and GM will not be a leading company for at least a decade. Yes, they can take the market share but superiority of tech is pretty obvious at this point. It would take at least 10 years for them to catch up with Tesla. That 10 years is assuming that they will focus their capital in investing into technological development to develop the tech for automation and EV.

VW CEO Herbert Diess said himself that Tesla's technology is years ahead of VW car companies' technology.

Tesla was just smart. They knew they had to sacrifice and bleed for a while to develop the techs and put themselves apart from others. Now, its time for the other companies to bleed and pay the price because there is no free shit in this world."
03/22/2021,stocks,"VW's gross margins are 17,5% and declining v.s. Tesla's 24% (would've been 28% if not for one-time costs in Q4, was 27,5% in Q3) and increasing.

VW are not the next Tesla, they are nothing like Tesla. Their software sucks, they are not vertically integrated and they're losing money one every EV they sell. The best they can do over the next decade is not go bankrupt while going through a period of extreme costs.

I think VW will do the best of all the legacy automakers, but there's very little chance they'll be bigger in 10 years than they are today."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Don't buy Nazi cars. Actually I would really forgive, but vw gained it's might through Jewish slavery and they don't take responsibility but deny it. I Hope they fail. Ugly City in Wolfsburg and an ugly ev car."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Wait, you're saying VWAGY is great but you own POAHY instead? Why?"
03/22/2021,stocks,Correct me if I’m wrong but VOW/VWAGY is for the Volkswagen group which includes all those brands not just Volkswagen
03/22/2021,stocks,"All of these companies have significant margin and even bankruptcy risks. The market is pricing that in. They're gonna have to stop building their highly profitable ICE cars and start making EVs that they can't make profitably yet. If they get through this decade AND somehow manage to turn themselves into a software company, there will be significant upside. But it's not very likely."
03/22/2021,stocks,How long do you plan on holding GME? Do you think a squeeze is still going to happen?
03/22/2021,stocks,"So how do your comments explain Nio, Li Auto, and Xpeng?

They don't have side businesses in the pipeline, and their core gross margins are lower than Tesla's, yet they command similar price-to-sales multiples.

The whole point of this years-long EV *pump* is to allow EV players to raise capital with minimal dilution.  Nobody's expecting profitability.

Why should the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto be treated differently?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"The DD was meant to alleviate your concerns.

My argument is that, if you buy VWAGY even at $42, you are still paying a ZERO multiple with regards to price-to-*EV*-sales.

This is something that no SPAC deal with EV startups can ever do."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Link?

> The best they can do over the next decade is not go bankrupt while going through a period of extreme costs.

EV companies have been losing money for years.  That has prevented them from receiving the coveted 20-times-sales multiple.

The whole point of this years-long EV pump is to enable money-*losing* companies with sizable EV businesses to raise capital with minimal dilution.

I said to forget earnings and profitability.  I also said that the 20-times-sales multiple ignores margins, too.  It's 20-times-sales for the sake of 20-times-sales."
03/22/2021,stocks,It's less volatile and should have more upside if the discount gap closes.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Nope.  Unlike Michael Burry, I think Tesla still has room to ""stonk"" before its bubble bursts.

I just think that the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, has way more upside than Tesla at current price levels."
03/22/2021,stocks,"It's like the blockbuster vs Netflix situation. Blockbuster was starting to go online but they were too slow and their legacy business was a hindrance. Any ICE manufacturer not actively working toward autonomous EV as their future cash cow is going to be left behind. VW is going in the right direction at least. Certain other players in the field, not so much. The ICE vehicle business is a drag that only makes the transition more difficult."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Exactly why I said anything EV is in a big bubble right now because of Tesla. In the end any growth company has to be valued based on its future cashflows. Nio is valued at close to 1.5x BMW, while BMW produces close to 3 million cars every year and has loads of factories they own. So UNLESS Nio diversifies other important revenue streams where margins could be higher, there's no reason for them to be valued so vastly different than BMW. Or, to put it differently, let's fast forward until BEVs are most of the car sales and tell me how Nio looks like as a mature company.

People are looking at Tesla and thinking it's valued as it is because it sells BEVs at a profit. It's valued at these multiples because there is a chance its high margin side business will produce loads of revenue . I'm referring here to FSD. Dealerships, storage, solar and insurance are relatively low margin and can only contribute a certain amount to Tesla's valuation"
03/22/2021,stocks,Fair enough. I’d be buying VOW tho since im european. Thanks for your DD!
03/22/2021,stocks,"Link to what? Every number I shared is taken from their earnings report, except the one-time costs which came from the earnings call."
03/22/2021,stocks,What happens to  POAHY if Porsche goes the IPO route?
03/22/2021,stocks,"I think tesla is slowly deflating. The sentiment has totally changed. Just look for tesla news at google, most are negative. And ARKs pricetarget is so ridiculous, even the fanboys doubt that, they recognize the pump."
03/22/2021,stocks,Sure vw is a good pick and has a lot of potential but american retail investor seem to hype it up a little bit to much
03/22/2021,stocks,"*Cough* Toyota *Cough*

[That company does *not* deserve any EV pump if it transitions late.]"
03/22/2021,stocks,"That 17.5% gross margin is most likely on overall sales, not on EV sales.

I know EV margins are likely lower, but lower EV margins at first did not prevent Tesla from zooming.  Lower EV [margins of 11.5% have not prevented Nio](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-fourth-quarter-and-full-1) from zooming.  Lower EV margins of [16.4% have not prevented Li Auto](https://kr-asia.com/ev-maker-li-auto-generates-strong-profits-as-deliveries-surge) from zooming.  Lower EV [margins of 4.6% have not prevented Xpeng](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210308005328/en/XPeng-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2020-Unaudited-Financial-Results) from zooming.

Lower EV margins should not prevent Volkswagen from earning the coveted 20-times-sales multiple for its EV business!"
03/22/2021,stocks,Why is POAHY trading at a discount to VWAGY and how are the two related? Does Porche own Volkswagon or something?
03/22/2021,stocks,"Porsche the company doesn't actually own the Porsche brand any more. They sold it to VW for shares, which their company now is a holding company for (I believe they also have minor things they do besides that). If Porsche (the subsidiary of VW) was spun out of VW, you'd see a completely new listing and whatever that yielded would benefit POAHY in the way it would benefit any shareholder.

- pretty much think of it as a holding company for VW shares and nothing to do with actual Porsche cars any more."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Based on the DD above, it's not hyped enough.

Based on key info from today's Deutsche Bank stuff, it's definitely not hyped enough."
03/22/2021,stocks,Oh yea. They are publicly the most anti EV of the big manufacturers and deserve to lose their market share.
03/22/2021,stocks,Didn't they say they have a solid state battery already?
03/22/2021,stocks,"The reason all of those startups are able to deal with it is because they don't have massive costs for converting existing infrastructure and workforce to EVs. On top of that, a lot of existing VW shareholders are not in that company for the future, but for today (dividends etc).

Personally I don't think VW will be a bad play long term, as I see them being one of the only legacy automakers that survive the next 10-20 years. That said, I think they will go through a very serious dip once people realize how fucked all these legacy automakers are and how expensive the transition is going to be for the business. That is when I would consider picking up VW."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Porsche does own Volkswagen, but even I don't know why POAHY is trading at a discount to VWAGY."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Toyota is as much vaporware on the EV revolution as QuantumScape, VW's SSB partner."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Solid state tech is 5-10 years away from being mass producible at comparable prices competitive with lithium-ion at best. If it's 5, Toyota will be too late, if it's 10, they'll already be bankrupt."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I am staying away from Ford and GM for this reason: Unlike VW, these two US-based losers have been bankrupt before.

They won't have second mover advantage by the time the Next Tesla is in its third inning regarding the EV transition."
03/22/2021,stocks,Isn't it a bad sign then that VW is partnered with QS?
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yeah, agreed. I think the chance Ford gets through this is close to zero, GM is slightly bigger but still pretty small."
03/22/2021,stocks,Ford has never gone bankrupt to my knowledge. Got a source?
03/22/2021,stocks,VW can always switch SSB partners *when* somebody beats QuantumScape.
2021-03-21 22:14:17,stocks,"Is this too many? I have over 20 investments in my portfolio, which contains mainly tech, dividend, and renewable energy stocks. My highest holdings are JD ADR, Alibaba, Realty Income, Lithium America and the S&P 500. I have invested over £5000 into the account and I'm putting in £500 every month. I have seen people say they have very diversified portfolios with only 4 stocks. I've been investing for about 9 months and I would like to know if my account has too many stocks.

any advice would be great"
03/22/2021,stocks,I read studies Found around 50-60 stocks has the most impact of eliminating risk. After that you have diminished returns. Assuming those stocks are well diversified ofc.
03/22/2021,stocks,It's not too many until to get to about 500.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Bro a month ago my portfolio was one stock. Now its like 25. If I find the right play I'm comfortable going back to 1. (Not gonna act like that 25 means I'm safe its literally all growth and mostly tech stocks)

Diversity should be established around your risk tolerance, knowledge of overall market trends,and CONVICTION IN THE STOCK. I was 60% NIO during its run-up. I was 100% GME during the squeeze. Don't be scared of high percentages."
03/22/2021,stocks,Which are your favorite?
03/22/2021,stocks,I think the point is that you can never have too many good stocks in your portfolio so as long as you are buying quality companies the more the better while reducing your volatility/risk. Sure the returns wouldn't be as good as focussing on just say 4 stocks but the risk adjusted returns would be insane and definitely outperform the markets. There just isn't enough emphasis on risk management and the idea of risk adjusted returns is something that would really come in handy when dealing with a big portfolio above 7figures.
03/22/2021,stocks,JD ADR i believe it's going to be the next alibaba

Does anybody have experience with Chase You Invest? I'm invested in some volatile stock and was wondering if I'm in a safe place assuming a squeeze occurs. My concern is in regards to limits/blocks on selling if the price explodes. From my understanding, Chase You Invest did ***not*** block the buying of shares during a squeeze late January 2021, which gives me the idea they're a safer bet than most.

2021-03-21 21:46:35,stocks,"Is Iberdrola getting overlooked by the market? Why is there no premium like for other clean energy stocks? Hi  guys & girls of r/stocks, this is my first comprehensive DD. I work as public  policy consultant for energy transition and believe that finally, their is no doubt left that wind, solar and hydro have won the energy game and will come to dominate the power systems at least in the countries with good potentials and high governance, with the rest at least  achieving high renewables penetration levels. A look at Orsted, Vestas,  Siemens Gamesa, even GE suggests many investors think that too. However,  Iberdrola might be a company with very little premium to pay for its  future potential. From what I gather, it’s very well positioned, well  managed, profitable, and its vision of where the energy sector is going  corresponds very well to my own.

**From insidermonkey.com:**

Iberdrola  has grown to be the number-one producer of wind power in the world. The  official website of Iberdrola also boasts its high installed renewable  capacity. With the value being over 31,000 MW, Iberdrola is regarded as  one of the cleanest in the energy sector. The company supplies energy to  over 100 million people across several countries, its subsidiaries  including Avangrid in the USA, and Scottish Power in the UK. Iberdrola  has also made a commitment to “reduce its emission intensity to 50  gCO2/kWh globally by 2030, thus achieving an 86 % reduction in three  decades, in addition to being carbon neutral globally by 2050.

So is it a buy? Here's my breakdown, let me know what you think.


**Metrics (2019 and 2020):**

- PE ratio: 19.88 (very reasonable compared to other companies in the renewable / clean tech business)
- Share price went up 22% YoY as of March 21st 2021 (again very  reasonable all things considered) – please let me know if I’m missing  something and we haven’t seen Iberdrola go the way of say, Orsted
- Assets: 122 billion EUR
- Liabilities: 35 billion EUR of financial debt; maturity comes in at  between 3.5 and 5 billion EUR yearly up to 2025 which seems should be  easily manageable (I can’t find the word “liabilities” anywhere in the  report – please let me know if I’m missing something – as stated below,  Iberdrola owns 5 nuclear plants in Spain where the decommissioning bill  should be due in the period between 2027 and 2035)
- Over 1 million EUR revenue per employee (more than e.g. Microsoft)
- Operating profit margin of 16,6% (IMO very, very good for a large and  diversified company in the middle of a complex pivot to new  technologies, business models and regulatory frameworks)
- Pay-out ratio has been around 70% of the net attributable profit in recent years, translating into \~5% dividend yield


**Leadership:**

- José Ignacio Sánchez Galán – CEO since 2001, executive chairman since  2006; also holds roles with JPMorganChase, World Economic Forum and two  other organisations; visiting lecturer at two universitites; received a  ton of awards in his career and seems well respected
- Francisco Martínez Córcoles – Business CEO since 2017; also member of  the Board of Directors of the Spanish  Electric Industry Associatio
- Aitor Moso Raigoso – Director Liberalized Business since 2016
- Armando Martinez Martinez – Director Network Business since 2018
- José Sainz Armada – CFO since
- Xabier Viteri Solaun – Director of the Renewable Energy Business since ?

All  in all, this seems a very experienced team with experience from the  power industry and others (banking, finance …), with lots of trained  engineers who’ve come to hold top management positions. Quite some  recent appointments. It’s all rather old white men, so zero points for  diversity, not sure if that matters in this case.


**Ownership structure:**

- Qatar Investment Authority 8.69%
- Blackrock 5.25%
- Norges Bank 3.43%
- Wikipedia also cites Norges Bank, Kutxabank and Bankia as large shareholders, but that info might be outdated

So all in all, very diversified ownership structure. Not sure that’s good or bad.

**Some important subsidiaries:**

- Scottish Power (UK)
- Avangrid (US)
- Neoenergia (BR)


**Market position and outlook:**

- Strong presence in some markets with high renewables potential (and  sometimes a favourable market environment) - Spain, UK, US, Mexico,  Brazil
- Likely the biggest  renewable power generator in the world (although I couldn’t find a  source confirming this); the biggest wind power generator in the world;  strong presence in the power grids segment; also present in power sales  and energy services segments
- One of the cleanest power generators with ca. 60% renewables in its portfolio
- The rest of Iberdrola generation portfolio is mostly combined-cycle gas  power plants which is the only fossil-based generation technology that  makes sense in decarbonising power systems for the next 20 to 30 years;  only trace amounts of coal
- Iberdrola also owns 5 nuclear plants in Spain with 3GW of total  generation capacity, which could come with a substantial decommissioning  bill when the power plants reach the end of life, but that should only  be between 2027 and 2035
- Iberdrola intends to double its clean generation capacity by 2025 by  investing 75 billion EUR; considering some of its shareholders and  generally positive environment for clean energy, financing shouldn’t be  an issue
- Iberdrola has also made  decisive strides into offshore wind, including floating; investments  are planned on storage business which I also think has some potential;  the importance of digitisation is stressed; on the other hand, Iberdrola  is entering green hydrogen business cautiously which I think is smart  as I think a lot of hype right now is only that


**Bull case:**

- Iberdrola continues as the biggest renewable energy major, maintaining  leading position in onshore wind, expanding its solar and grids  portfolio, while not bleeding too much cash with gas power
- It makes a splash in the offshore wind and successfully enters the  green hydrogen game, all of that while staying nimble and digitising
- That leads to increasing the turnover while maintaining high revenue  and profit margins, maintaining the dividend yield while substantially  increasing the market cap


**Bear Case:**

- If I had to find one, it would be that multiple of these possible  developments materialise concurrently: Iberdrola starts losing market  share in the onshore wind, never manages to become a major player in  offshore wind, gets wrong-footed by regulatory changes in the grids  segment, overreaches on hydrogen, and starts bleeding cash in the gas  power segment
- Oh and it becomes  apparent in the next few years that the Spanish nuclear plants  decommissioning bill due in 10 years or so will be huge and no one’s  thought of setting aside funds for this over the last 40 years (I should  check this, actually)
- IMO, none  of these developments on its own is very likely, some are actually very  unlikely, but overall, we should expect at least one or two to  materialise


**TL;DR:**

All  things considered, Iberdrola seems like one of the best bets in the  clean energy sector that is very likely to grow. It’s well positioned in  the key segments such as onshore wind, solar and grids, and has hydro  and gas power assets to provide backup power to it its variable  renewables portfolio. It also has a very good position in the nascent  offshore energy wind segment with huge potential, and if hydrogen  becomes a thing, there’s no reason Iberdrola shouldn’t be a player. Its  gas power plants might be a minor liability but also might be a net  positive. Iberdrola is well managed and should have no problem financing  its ambitious investment plan that aims to double its renewable energy  portfolio by 2025. It has 3x as much assets as liabilities, and debt  maturation in the coming years is in the range of EBIT which is very  comfortable. All this says BUY.

03/22/2021,stocks,"It's the same every time. Ark comes out with new projections, people who have thoroughly investigated Tesla are not surprised, others call it insane because it's never been done before. Guess what? Tons of things have never been done before, and almost everything Elon Musk's companies do have never been done before. If you keep looking at what was possible in the past and not what's being done in the present, you're gonna keep missing these opportunities.

In 5-10 years time you're all gonna be wondering how you missed it when others didn't. This is how you missed it.

Just to give you an example how easy it is to make false assumptions if you haven't done the homework:

>  42B for a human ride hailing network: Double Uber/Lyft combined on a service that they don’t even have a business model for? Using on Tesla’s vs all cars on the road in the case of Uber and Lyft? Doubling the size of the ride sharing network while driving Uber and Lyft to 0 in 4 years?

You're missing the fact that anyone using full autonomy will also be paying Tesla anywhere between $400 and $1000 a month. That's how you easily double Uber and Lyft's businesses.

> Nobody in insurance has 40% margins for a reason.

That's because nobody has the amount of data on all of their customers like Tesla does. If you so much as fart at the wrong time in a Tesla, they can know and put you on a higher premium. Their insurance will be much cheaper for the user while having higher margins simply because they'll have fewer accidents and more data on their users.

> Growth: 80% revenue growth compounding. On a company that grew 14% in 2019 and 28% in 2020 despite still being a small company where larger growth rates are possible? Elon himself hopes for 50% growth, which in itself is pretty unrealistic as the company scales.

This is just a bunch of incorrect or irrelevant statements thrown together.

First, it's not relevant how much their revenue grew in the past when 60-90% of their automotive net income is going to come from ride hailing and software sales in the future. Every car they sell now will be able to generate massive amounts of recurring income in the future if they solve full autonomy. That's how you reach 80% revenue growth (and to be honest, if they indeed solve full autonomy it's going to be much more than that).

Second, Elon never mentioned 50% annual growth in revenue. Tesla's targeting 50% annual PRODUCTION growth where 2021 and 2022 will be significantly higher and later it might be lower, but the average will be 50% throughout this decade. Obviously if you are already growing production by 50% per year, and then throw in the addition of recurring software sales of 10-20% of the average car price per year, including on cars sold in the past, 80% is easily possible.

> Autonomy: Did anyone watch that Oakland video? This software is years out. Assuming by some miracle it was achieved by the end of 2022 (unlikely at best), that would give them roughly 2-3 years to scale from nothing to over 300 BILLION in revenue. You know, bigger than Apple and around Amazons size.

This is the crux of the matter. If you believe full autonomy is feasible within 3 years, Ark's targets make perfect sense. If you don't, they're bonkers. It's got nothing to do with the research itself, purely with when you believe robotaxis are possible. Personally, if I see how well the FSD beta is performing when considering they don't even have the most powerful supercomputer in the world up and running yet, which should be ready this summer, I think it's at least 50-50. You clearly disagree. We'll know who was right in a few years, but to call the entire model ""wildly unrealistic"" just because you disagree on something that can entirely go either way is just stupid."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Look, I'm not saying you're wrong. But the absolute certainty you're speaking with is ridiculous. You don't have a crystal ball anymore than Cathie does. Do I think Cathie projections are a bit ridiculous? Yup. Do I think her chances of being right are greater than 0%? Yup. Additionally do you have the same accolades as her? 

I take issue however with your attack on people investing in Ark. I don't own any Ark, but who are you to tell someone how to spend their money?

I'm not so much attacking your premise as I am your attitude and your ""I'm holier than thou"". You come across as patronizing, and to be honest a dick. I wouldn't listen to you anymore than Cathie."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yeah just a reminder that before 2020 it would have been better to invest in nflx, amzn, aapl, Msft, fb, goog, semis than arkk since inception.

Basically, arkk had a killer 2020 year and people value cathie’s opinions based on recent performance bias.

There are many fund managers that did better pre 2020. I’m sure there will be a change in best performer in 2021.

Fund managers, if you read academic studies, struggle in the **consistent** outperformance."
03/22/2021,stocks,"the Ark funds are sort of a cult at this point, a bit like Tesla can be. if you read the YouTube comments on any video with Cathie Woods and it's just non-stop fawning. 

Jim Cramer was correct in saying she needs to somehow restrict deposits if she wants to outperform in the future. small funds are more likely to out-perform than large funds, once you get large it's harder to make moves without causing a ripple effect in the market, and harder buy smaller company/low-volume stocks.  lots of good managers have closed their funds to new investors from time to time to keep their edge and keep the AUM under a certain size."
03/22/2021,stocks,The biggest red flag to me was the claim this came from a monte carlo model.  No model breaks down that cleanly unless either the inputs or modeling is ape level simplistic.

03/22/2021,stocks,"I'm not saying Cathy wood is right, but people also said she was crazy the first time when she gave Tesla a price target of 4000$ in 2019 (that was their bullish scenario).

at the time tesla was between 250 and 350 a share, so their price target was more than 10 times higher. at the same time other analysts were downgrading their price targets on tesla

then in 2020 TSLA went from 400$ a share to a high of 4400$ a share (in pre-split value)

and today after the dips it is at 3500$ a share (in pre-split value).

their new price target is 3000$ a share (post-split value) which is only about 4 times what the stock is at today.

does it sound crazy? sure.

but it's also very possible."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Agreed 60% of people lending out their £40k-£60k+ car as an autonomous taxi is maybe a bit much, but by then the gigafactories and infrastructure will be churning out millions of vehicles, batteries, and charging stations... Tesla could flood the market themselves with robotaxis, by then the production costs will be alot cheaper, and it'd be a case of taking market share from traditional ride hailing networks - in theory."

03/22/2021,stocks,"This is such a stupid argument. It's like someone in 2007 saying the iPhone is never going to work because the smartphone industry was only worth about $0. If you've got self driving cars, obviously that's going to be an entirely new market completely unrelated to the taxi/limo industry other than it taking up that entire market on top of the new business it will create.

If I can choose between owning a car and being stuck in traffic on my way to work every day or using robotaxis for a few hundred euro's a month (cheaper than a train subscription in my country) while I'm working or playing games on my way to work, there's not a single chance in the world I'll buy a car."
03/22/2021,stocks,You’re thinking of the market as it exists rn: a service you use to get from points A to B if you don’t have another way to do so. I think the long term vision is that instead of owning a car you buy a subscription to a ride service and you use it for practically everything. Long term I see this as inevitable it’s just a question of who takes advantage and how quickly we get there

I don't blame you for being defensive either. You're a patronizing asshole who couldn't hold Cathies jock strap if we're being a realist here.

Ps
Long on Tesla, and have been for a long time."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yes, I am saying exactly that. Just acquiring their license to write insurance in all 50 states may take them a year or longer if they start right now and devote considerable resources to it. Also, Tesla would then need to operate under certain capital reserve requirements that other insurance companies have to follow. Essentially they would need to have a certain amount of cash on hand at all times in case of a catastrophic event (eg. hurricanes, earthquakes, et). And as mentioned earlier they will need the operations staff to back up said activities and build it from the ground up. They have no competitive advantage here except maybe that some companies don't want to write insurance for teslas due to the partial self-drive feature, which is for a good reason. Self-drive is a liability nightmare from an insurance perspective."
03/22/2021,stocks,"You do realize that her previous price target was for 2024, right? You really think Tesla will trade down through 2024 even if the stimulus would completely stop?"

03/22/2021,stocks,"Exactly my thoughts. Imagine the additonal insurance costs too, letting a whole range of people use your car during the day. No way 60% of people would opt in for that."
03/22/2021,stocks,Exactly. Fuck. That.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Then you're insured, that person is going to jail (as he's on camera and you have his ID) and even when they get out they will never be able to use a robotaxi again. It's the same thing as getting scammed on eBay or when ordering something online; sure it will happen on occasion, but the system ensures people can't do it more than once or maybe a few times before shutting you out. Only here you've got insurance and a way to trace their real identity, so even if it does happens it's less of a problem."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I don't think she's looking to only see a few percentage for the next year and then vanish from trashing her reputation and career. An outrageous report isn't going to move the needle enough to make it worth it when she's positioned to make billions.

Maybe she just thinks her clients won't care. Or she genuinely thinks this looks right. I don't know."

And during the period where the federal mileage deduction is targeted at ICE vehicles pretty much all your income would be tax deductible. The thing I think will be the most difficult is handling who is making sure people aren’t leaving trash in the car before it goes on to someone else. Maybe there will be cleaning stations that cars visit between fares, or a strict rating system for customers. Or maybe people will have car pools with a smaller group of folks they know instead of random strangers."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Ok that’s you. 

Many others will want to own a car and have that flexibility. 

There are tons of people in the city that don’t own cars today and use the subway or the bus. It’s even cheaper than an autonomous ride hailing service.

Teslas are computers capturing data that insurance companies can only dream of. This is what actuarial science has wet dreams about. They can make much more compelling insurance offers as a result. 

Teslas also don’t need as much maintenance and when they do it’s going to be cheaper for Tesla as they arent going a third party mechanic - they go to a Tesla service centre - so they profit from the repair as well."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Tesla is realistically worth between $50 and $100 today. 

So yea, it could trade down."

Not cheaper than a robotaxi and less convenient as well, since you're dependent on stations.

03/22/2021,stocks,"It is a fair point. People invest in companies based upon revenue, cash flow, and debt. Compared to other automakers, Tesla should absolutely not trade at that market cap on paper. In fact, Tesla is really really overpriced based on fundamentals alone.

BUT

Stocks are supply and demand at the end of the day. If people want to sell or buy it at a certain price, then that’s that. Free market hooray!

Don’t be too upset when people challenge an idea. It’s when everyone agrees is when you should be cautious.

I personally have some shares in ARKF and ARKK because I want to see what Cathie Woods has in store. I don’t agree with her Tesla valuation, but what the hell do I know about anything?"
03/22/2021,stocks,Actually in the US urban areas have 50k+ and urban clusters have 10k+ people.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Good point, what I've seen seems to agree with that 2500  person metric. What the census classifies as urban might not be what most people think and honestly it's unclear what the exact distinction is as the official definition of rural is ""not urban"". 

In any case, since 2010 ""urban"" populations have been increasing while rural populations decreasing or remaining constant. Take this information and draw your conclusions as you wish."
03/22/2021,stocks,It's that their best case? Something they gave a ~50 percent chance too hinging all on autonomy. If that doesn't happen then that scenario doesn't happen.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Well, since very few have any kind of autonomous driving (beyond cruise control), I'd say very few.

With Tesla accidents they are probably going to investigate a lot of them because it has that potential for a novel car system to be at least partly to blame."
03/22/2021,stocks,"No, I am saying that the improved data is a marginal issue. Lets pretend that Tesla's treasure trove of data creates downstream revenue improvements of 5% (unlikely, but I would say this is the high side). If I recall Cathy's estimate had those improvements running at something like 40%, which is ridiculous. Its funny how in the world of technology being first is considered such a competitive advantage until it works against your bull case. The legacy carriers have FAR more advantage in experience working within and pricing past the regulatory components in states like MA that have strict controls on pricing (which makes outsized profits of the size Cathy describes impossible). Also, another factor you are not considering is that legacy carriers use substantial bundling discounts as moats against small-frys (in the insurance world) like Tesla. Most customer's are going to be unwilling to lose a several hundred dollar discount on homeowners/boat/motorcycle/umbrella insurance just to save a few bucks on auto with daddy elon.   
Look, the tech is cool, but that doesn't automatically make it a vast advantage. Your fanboy cultism is butting against the realities of the insurance industry."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Also, you know what? The data they are gathering on their drivers isn't even that much of an advantage. Just knowing how YOUR insureds drive on the road is merely a single data point that doesn't matter in a sea of data about how ALL drivers are acting on the road. For instance, Tesla would have to pay our on Uninsured Motorist Property Damage (UMPD) in some states. Meaning that in a state like Florida (where I grew up) with notoriously shitty drivers, Tesla is still going to pay out on lots of claims no matter how good a driver the Tesla owner is, because of all the uninsured shit drivers around them.   
In the meantime legacy carriers have navigated and underwritten risk like this for years and have FAR MORE data on it than Tesla will starting out."

03/22/2021,stocks,"I agree with what you're saying, but a $50B-100B valuation on a car company that is growing sales 50-80% annually with almost double VW's gross margins, a product that is so disruptive it could reach massive market shares in the long run, the potential for solving autonomous driving and therefore become one of the most profitable companies in the world, AND a bunch of other businesses (like solar, energy and insurance) is laughable at best."
03/22/2021,stocks,"2.5k was the urban cluster number for the 2010 Census, unsure if it was updated for the 2020 one."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Uber started out with the idea of regular people driving here and there, Airbnb was supposed to be something you did when you were on vacation or you just had a spare room. There are some people like that still but most are doing it as a business because it’s a fair bit of work to make sure your car or house is guest friendly at all times. I imagine most owners will buy them as literal investment vehicles to get a straightforward form of passive income."

03/22/2021,stocks,No I think it’s the institutions stealing stimulus checks from retail in over their head.
03/22/2021,stocks,I'd when it was updated. It also has to do with density of people per square mile. I just know about 80% of the US population lives in about 2% of the land.
03/22/2021,stocks,Sorry what?
03/22/2021,stocks,"As best I can tell, the 2020 team hasn't published what definition they're using, so it hasn't been updated publicly. As of Dec 7, 2020, the 2.5k number was the correct number (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural.html)."
03/22/2021,stocks,OP is basically saying retail investors are pleb dummies.  Classy.
03/22/2021,stocks,I’m saying him thinking retail can influence a $700b market cap company is laughable

03/22/2021,stocks,Actually have excellent returns on stocks that have virtually zero chance of losing 90% of their value like Tesla very much does.  Enjoy that when it happens soon fanboy.
03/22/2021,stocks,Below average returns can be excellent. That's the spirit! Keep staying positive. The company can lose most of its value and still be a great company. It happens every year.
03/22/2021,stocks,"You don't have a clue what you're talking about but I see that doesn't stop you from talking.

Great companies can be vastly overvalued.  It happens every year."

03/22/2021,stocks,I'll consider it once it gets back down to around $100/share..  Maybe I'll even buy yours once you're sick of the koolaid hangover.
03/22/2021,stocks,I take it back. You'll never get it and will get increasingly confused as the price rises over the next decade. Hopefully your analysis is better elsewhere than it is on Tesla or else you should really stick to index funds.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Thought you were done fanboy?

Your ""analysis"" is based on pie in the sky BS from a pathological liar... That's who you are trusting your money with, the PT Barnum of the automobile industry... When that becomes brutally obvious to you in the form of massive red numbers in your portfolio, you'll wish you had stuck to SPY."

03/22/2021,stocks,"The US is governed and run by corporations. When are y'all gonna wake up. You are effectively only allowed to choose between 2 candidates, whoever the DNC and RNC pick to be theirs and no one else. Settle for Biden and see muted corruption coverage. Or pick Trump and have it be blatantly in your face. You won't win.

Bernie got close to being a revolutionary and the entire DNC conspired against him to stop the DNC from losing control of the ""good"" party. Republicans are republicans.

This is the how the game is.

Elites can insider trade and bend the rules however they want. Poors get back in line."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Soooo when is the coup against the 1%? All of the bullshit is right in our face. The people have been in the dark mostly before now, but word is out and we still allow it so who's at fault? People continue to live without stable human necessities in one of the greatest nations in current time, why? We give them data, we give them taxes, we give them our time and energy- all while whining about petty distractions. The two-party system has to go. And people need to see past the weak-minded social plots and focus on taking back our country from the guilded corporations and government waste. Time passing only fortifies their corrupt powet over us."

He ain't goin to jail."

A few were cheats in university with families that had high expectations. They were the ones that would incriminate themselves, while he maintained limited exposure to the wrongdoings. The SEC and FBI could not peg any of the insider trading to the man himself. 

It's less about some of the conspiracy being mentioned in this thread. Cohen excels at having others do his dirty work."

The rich are fundamentally different from other citizens.  They have more rights. They own politicians, police, and even the military and State Department.  They can do almost anything they want.  If they get caught, they pay a fine, usually something amounting to less than a percent of their profit. Frankly, drug lords pay more to launder their money than hedge fund managers or investment bankers."

They would check with them first see what's up. They might not directly be working together, but still it's fucked up."

1) if you don’t get caught, it is not a crime and;
2) the golden rule: she who has the gold makes the rules.

03/22/2021,stocks,Like half of the wealthiest people in this country would be in prison if they were ever actually held accountable for their actions. Look at the housing market collapse. The wealthy and well-connected are not beholden to the same laws as you and I.

ahem...

1. I’m sure many made great returns in the ultra bull market since pandemic started. But how about now?

2. Doubling or tripling $10K or $100K is much easier than doing anything remotely similar with $1bn+ AUM. You don’t get the same opportunities to invest your money and your impact on liquidity is much greater (among other factors)."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Meh. Par for the course. Everybody who can, does insider trading because it is a ""victimless"" crime, chances of getting caught are small, it is hard to prove and the payoffs are big. Wall Street is a crooked place. We all know it."

03/22/2021,stocks,SEC doesn't deal with criminal charges. The department of justice deals with that. It's two separate court systems
03/22/2021,stocks,Trillion dollar question: why does it pay better to work in private equity than to work at the SEC?
03/22/2021,stocks,The 1.8 is just SEC's cut.
03/22/2021,stocks,The SEC does not have the authority to file criminal charges that put someone in jail. That would be the FBI.
03/22/2021,stocks,In other words if I don’t care I should work at the sec and prosecute these guys
03/22/2021,stocks,It was never the SEC’s job to provide justice. It was to provide consumer confidence.

03/22/2021,stocks,"I think what the problem is that prosecution, aside from evidence naturally, requires a chain of well-intentioned and good-faith actors. All it takes is one or two corrupt links and the whole chain is worth fuck-all - resulting in, effectively and practically, regulatory capture."

03/22/2021,stocks,"Not true. 
Wikipedia:
“Cohen settled his civil case with regulators in January 2016; the agreement with the SEC prohibited Cohen from managing outside money until 2018.”"
03/22/2021,stocks,"How come Wikipedia says this:
“Cohen settled his civil case with regulators in January 2016; the agreement with the SEC prohibited Cohen from managing outside money until 2018.”"
03/22/2021,stocks,That’s why they’re is a higher power to take all those out. They paved a nice road for us and we are thankful. We will be them very soon. But by them I mean we will have acquired more than them. We donated more to apes and other people more than those greedy fucks. THIS IS SPARTAAA.
03/22/2021,stocks,"Exactly,  but they are worse than poor people. Fake charities that just hide the foundations money."
03/22/2021,stocks,I think it would be more accurate to say that honest people make them sick.
03/22/2021,stocks,And some people brush that off as a conspiracy theory. Ok fine if not then it’s broad daylight ass fuckery. If not one of those then what is it?
03/22/2021,stocks,He worked for the FED?! Lol this is literally Karen gillan in the big short.
03/22/2021,stocks,"""Poor people""

People who actually produce something, who build or create, but just aren't natural predators in the way those parasites are."
03/22/2021,stocks,This is happening in every industry. The US is entirely corrupt and full of dirty money. This is capitalism.
03/22/2021,stocks,"This really makes me wonder, what is the *real* reason government agencies go after certain people? They let corrupt (but it sounds like very influential) people continue to do corrupt things, which makes them pretty corrupt themselves. So, are they just going after people who are break laws but have a negligible influence in the industry?"
03/22/2021,stocks,How much money is 3-4x their salary?
03/22/2021,stocks,"Do you think if the government paid regulators better, would that fix the problem? Or would private industry / special interest groups just keep upping their bud to poach regulators?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"So, which bank did you jump ship for?  Just kidding.  It hard to have a conscience and be able to look into the mirror, all the whole cheating and screwing over decent people.  You did the right thing by leaving.  
Sounds like you'd be a great fit to investigate those that are supposedly investigating financial fraud."
03/22/2021,stocks,"This is shocking. I used to work in environmental regulation, and this attitude/state would not have been ok."
03/22/2021,stocks,The solution perhaps is to pay the SEC members an astonishingly large amount of money. That way they have no incentive to leave or compromise.  Throw in a percentage of fines leveled and we might get a tad bit closer.
03/22/2021,stocks,Sounds like it should be the plot of the popular televisual show Billions...
03/22/2021,stocks,... <nod> pretty much.
03/22/2021,stocks,Show me the data
03/22/2021,stocks,"Sorry but that just isn't true. For every video of a young innocent black kid getting shot in the back by a cop there is one of a guilty white person doing whatever the hell they feel like doing to another cop with no repercussions. Systemic racism, white privilege, call it what you want but it's definitely alive and well and doing better than ever."
03/22/2021,stocks,Whoa. Who said anything about that? Insecure much? **Banking** tribe my friend...
03/22/2021,stocks,"Why exactly do you think he settled it after decades in the asset management biz?
Out of the generosity of his heart or to avoid jail time (even if in a minimum security facility )"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I was wrong about the lifetime ban, my apologies. His firm SAC paid a $1.2BN fine"
03/22/2021,stocks,">When their own self perceived self interests align with “what is right”, then good things happen.

That's exactly right! I think people need to understand no politicians are ""for the people"". Those do-gooders just happen to have their self-interest aligned with ""what's right"". 
Bernie literally got himself arrested with a black woman because he believed civil rights would prevail and he would win politically. 
Don't believe me? Tell me which ""true socialist"" would buy 3 mansions with our campaign donation leftovers and then asked for more money. He donated less to charity than Trump. 

All of these politicians basically yolo-ed politically with their actions, but instead yolo-ing with $ in the stock market, they did it with politics."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yup its not so much what they know, but who they know.  


Kinda like good lawyers."
03/22/2021,stocks,It’s called American greed

03/22/2021,stocks,"The worst part is that it is very easily avoidable and not difficult to create a better system with someone neutral. People exist who would love to be in a position to put the others in their place, just need to get the right ones."

That way they silence the persons opinion before even trying to understand that most ""anti-vaxxers"" just want better, safer trials conducted on the vaccines, which the pharmaceutical companies refuse to do.  
  
There has still never been a double blind placebo study, the gold standard of scientific review, of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people, so we dont and will probably never even know if vaccinated people are better off because the pharmaceutical companies refuse to do the studies. We don't even have double blind placebo studies of vaccinated vs. placebo, another gold standard of scientific research. For something as important as vaccines that they want to inject the entire world with, shouldn't these studies be done to make 100% sure they are safe before handing them out like candy? We live in a clown world.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Back in the days when the large players had large orders.  Traders used to front run these orders by shaving just in front of the order.  You can do this in the open market but when the order is your client's then it made it highly illegal for you to do it.

&#x200B;

Citadel with it's high frequency, uses this same concept.  Especially for market orders, the system will scan through dark pool or other ECNs to buy the shares cheaper and fill your order at a higher price.  Or the system can be fulfilling their large client orders that sit in the dark pool.  This is basically modern they front running all orders.  Even tho, it's 10 cents here and 5 cents here.  It adds up to billions of dollars.  Citadel pays for order flow and not have their own brokerage because if they did that with their own clients it would make it illegal.  But I don't see how this is not a scam against the small guys.  They constantly take money out of retailers, almost like a casino.  End result they get richer and retailers worse off.

Have you ever had your order pending or cancellation was pending and it was taking long.  Sometimes they will hold the order to see if the market goes against the order to fill it if it does.  Immediately putting the order in red and immediately making their pocket richer.  

Dont believe that they are vital to efficient market and retailers pay less transactions, majority of that is due to technology advancement.  Citadel is running a casino like business where they don't lose and public loses all the time.  This is one of the reasons why the cards are stacked against the public.

&#x200B;

All orders should be transparent not hidden, at one centralized market, where it is first come first serve basis without machines shaving to 0.120138 decimals.  These machines are designed to take money out of the market period.  We shouldn't have ECNs running wild, first come first serve has to become the standard. 

&#x200B;

if the regulators really want to protect retailers, they should be minimum 20 second orders where it cannot be cancelled within 20 seconds of the order going in.  And small cancellation fee for cancelling orders.  Maybe 5 cents.  This will eliminate high frequency money machines."
03/22/2021,stocks,"I will address the grid problem as the other two have been covered already. You need to think in terms of what energy is actually required for a car. The average car in the USA does about 10 000 miles each year iirc. That's 30 miles per day. Let's take quite an aggressive consumption of 300Wh per mile and it work out to each car needing 9 kWh of energy per day. Is that a lot? Not really. Charging this during a 12 hour window during the night is only equivalent to having a microwave oven on at 3/4 of its power. There's already a big drop in electric energy consumption during the night and that actually causes a lot of problems for the grid. So having cars slowly charging at night will mostly pose no problems to the grid and it's more a challenge of accessibility to a low power charger rather than a question of ""where does the energy come from?"""
03/22/2021,stocks,"I made the same point. At the end of the day, a car is a car.  As of a few years ago, a whole generation or two had already decided car ownership wasn't something to aspire to.  It entirely conceivable that this year's love affair with EV ownership could be short lived and the trend away from car ownership could return.  

I'll separate out the issue of ""self-driving"" because it's even further away from pervasive reality than EV's.  Self driving will be niche for a long time to come, and that niche will be specific areas with perfect roads and perfect weather.  I'll believe in the supremacy of self-driving right after they figure out how to make things like auto-correct work properly."

03/22/2021,stocks,"I have to fully and wholeheartedly disagree here. I discussed this earlier but corporations are where progress is to be made in terms of the technology.  The progress will only come from the guidance of consumers. The government is not to be depended on to lead the way. Politics is the worst form of advancement. With the new administration we will see a push towards hydrogen, battery tech, carbon capture, and of course renewables.  But that was not the priorty of the last administration.

I am an electrical engineer work on many of the issues plaguing or electric system now.  What we, the people, need to do is decide what is important to use and there will be a corporation or a dozen that will come along to fill the need.

You mention euphoria and imply we are in a fad or something.  Unfortunately that is incorrect.  EV exists because people want to drive a car that has less impact on the environment. In addition, regardless of what government interference or belief, oil is a limited resource. I have no idea how many years we have left in terms of supply but coal and oil will run out. Why not design and improve the next generation of energy supply?  

For all reading this, a quiz. How many people realize there were steam powered cars before the Model A? 

As for work only occuring in the past decade....not even close. True they are becoming more mainstream and more companies are going public but there has been advancements made in battery tech and distributed energy resources for 15-20 years on a large scale and longer than that on a small scale."

Cars can take long trips without the long recharges and the system for recharging can be optimized to limit system impacts while reducing costs."

Before you decide what I do and don't know (having never met me nor know about my knowledge base which is not ""propoganda"" but my CAREER) take a gander at the dimensions of a dry cask for storing spent fuel. Next take a gander on the exact time that your ""football field"" will remain toxic.

Next, the Lambo.  How many of these are on the road today?  I Didn't watch the video( thanks for that though) but since it was a Tesla versus an Aventador, try an Tesla X versus a Ford or Chevy.  I like cars and I can say that Apples to Apples an EV has higher torque and will beat a not tuned sports car costing $400-500k. (That's right boys and girls a highly tuned stupid expensive sports car that we all see in the driveway of every American home).

You say EVs doesn't exist except for government money.  Please find for me the document in the DOE archives saying to fund electric vehicle instead of the pitiful attempt to embarrass yourself.  I didn't claim that electric cars don't get a tax credit but merely pointed out that other industries get them also.

> Atomic waste is bad yes, but I can't believe it is any more cumulatively harmful than all the fossil fuels. 

Reddit is massively astroturfed by, and in favor or, the nuclear industry.  But their claim of being clean and safe is pure guilty projection.  They claim ""clean"" to gaslight the fact that nothing is more toxic than nuclear waste.  It's harmful for 25,000 years, and despite promises that a solution is ""just around the corner"" since before either of us were born, that solution remains un-discovered.  

All we have is ""let's stash it in this remote place or that poor area, and just pray we don't spill any trucking it there""

It's the same with their gaslight ""safe"" claim.  When nuclear fails, it's anything but safe.  It means your country or area becomes uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years.  That's longer than we have written record of humanity.  And that's the antithesis of safe.  

Even the the fancy new fantasy reactors have the same essential flaw as existing: they all rely on the tragic hubris that humans are perfect, and can't possibly make *misteaks* in the design, construction, and operation.  That is, of course, an ultimately fatal overconfidence.

The rich nuclear industry seeds false talking points, and the tech-adoring young men who dominate Reddit take those and embellish and amplify them.

  


> And no one in this country has even been killed in a nuclear accident, thousands have been killed in coal mines.

Ok, so you're saying nuclear should be abolished along with coal.  We agree.

And before any nuclear fans come at me as not having solutions, I do: conservation and renewables have made huge progress and have even more massive potential.  The sun and wind and water give us enough energy in a day to run us for a year.  It's just a matter of harnessing it properly."

One extra item to add about nuclear is that to define it as green or good for the environment the definition must be restricted to it's emissions I feel.  Nuclear makes steam.  But it is not renewable in that like oil and coal there is a finite supply of uranium.

Now fusion.  That will be awesome to see come to fruition."

03/22/2021,stocks,"I use it like that. It's short for ""not this (upcoming) Monday, but the next"", so you just say next Monday and everybody knows what you mean. Never heard anyone complain about it lol"
03/22/2021,stocks,"I absolutely hate it but I’ve heard people say “next Monday” meaning essentially “the Monday of next week,” which is more or less the same as people who say it meaning “the next Monday that happens.” 

If it’s like, Tuesday-Wednesday, I will verify with people that they truly mean next Monday as opposed to “this coming Monday.” It SHOULD be unnecessary to do so, but it seems like the proximity to the Monday in question seems to matter.

One quirk is that even though I completely disagree with you (IMO, “this Monday” is the upcoming Monday and “next Monday” is the Monday AFTER that), I use “next Monday” and “Monday after next” interchangeably. It doesn’t really make sense but that’s what I do."
03/22/2021,stocks,"that isn't how chip manufacturing works, at all. AMD and Nvidia can't just set up foundries at the same scale or level of expertise as TSMC's. If anything, Intel is the one major player that would be least affected if TSMC went down for any reason, and they're still struggling to move beyond years old technology. likewise with Samsung (which by the way Nvidia only signed on with because TSMC was at capacity with AMD + new console generation) It's seriously ridiculous to think that the world could just move on from TSMC in the next 10-20 years given how everyone, AMD, Nvidia, automakers etc. want a slice of the pie right now. if you really want to have an informed opinion on TSMC I would suggest going on /r/hardware, /r/amd, /r/nvidia etc. and read up on new and upcoming tech"

The crazy thing is with the potential positive growth of the company staying long and holding shares should continue to be a viable strategy for the foreseeable future.

03/22/2021,stocks,"You really think that hedge funds will continue to short the stock that has not one, but *two* active and major investigations (SEC and congressional), then **lie about it**? The stock that singlehandedly created entire communities dedicated to the idea of fucking hedgies over, regardless of the personal losses incurred? The stock that already cost them hundreds of millions on the first ride of the ol’ squeeze train?

Hell no. Anyone who answers yes to those questions are lying to themselves and you. If any one of us were in their position right now, we would report even the thought of shorting GME because of the potential cost of getting caught lying about it. And as if that wasn’t enough, why would they continue to short this extremely dangerous stock for almost two months after being handed a once-in-a-lifetime get-out-of-jail-free pass?

The painful truth is that shorts have had not only plenty of time to cover (two months since the initial run up), but plenty of reasons to not even utter the letters GME. The risk management headache alone makes it not worth shorting, but after that, there’s still ~10 million people actively looking to fuck your short position over. Then you should also consider the fact that anyone dumb enough to still be short GME is likely shorting from its current price point (lower ones were probably margin called), meaning they are making money off this second unfounded buying euphoria. The only upward-driving forces at play for this recent run up are the CFO replacement (not worth a 400% increase) and WSBers buying from other, more paper-handed WSBers. As great as short squeezes are, GME is no longer a squeeze play. If you think it’s attractive at its current price point, be my guest. But too many people don’t understand the idea of a party being over and are still being strung along by the carrot-on-a-stick that the GME short squeeze has become."

I know people who bought GME just to stick it to Wall Street. Both sides of the political aisle, young and old, etc it didn't matter. Once people saw what happened with Robinhood they got even madder and doubled down lol. They can sell so much products to these people now it's insane. Think about it. Not only are zoomers and millennials in this but their parents have spent thousands at GME over the years too so they have skin in the game too. GME has gotten multiple generations of kids to shop there with there parents and now more will do the same. It's basically like McDonald's with Happy Meals to get kids hooked early...same concept here. If GME caters to all of these people and builds up their ecom presence, they can actually have a decent company over the long term. They should look into buying some up and coming gaming companies and create original gaming content like Netflix creates original content. There are tons of ways for them to create recurring revenue streams of off all of these people if they play their cards right"

03/22/2021,stocks,"Way to discuss with actual information and facts to support your disagreement. I get lots of people are emotionally attached to gamestop, but a rebuttal of simply name calling shows absolutely nothing to support your argument and only shows a possible lack of intellect or understanding on your part. I’m totally interested in actually hearing why GME is a good business plan for investment, that’s why I’m here. If you’d like to discuss that, I’m all ears. If you’re just going to toss out shade, then clearly you have nothing to add here so move along. 

And to add, no I don’t think it’s worth 3 billion. It’s currently hemorrhaging money to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars per year in LOSSES. It’s currently valued as much as Kellogg’s brand which is everywhere and super profitable. And unlike Kellogg’s, I don’t see an increase in desire for their product going forward. I loved GameStop and always enjoyed shopping there as my go to gaming store in the past but I haven’t been there in years. I buy the consoles online at Best Buy and games online now. I buy accessories at Best Buy too since they’re often priced better. I did buy a game pass on sale at GameStop online but they can’t be making much on that (as their current business model suggests, hence the massive losses). Sorry for the novel here but I legitimately am interested in why people think this is a worthwhile investment outside of short squeezing hedge funds (which is great but not a long term plan)."

The best thing that can happen to you when you write a covered call is for the stock price to dip below the strike + before exercise and stay below that level until after the option expires, then shoot up. That's how you actually maximize your profit. You're bearish short-term with a covered call and would be bullish after expiry if you didn't get exercised + continue to hold the shares.

They're also correct that in their scenario where the stock price jumped up only with no dip preceding, it would have been far better to have sold a put than a covered call. I'm happy to write out an example using current options prices on any stock if you really can't understand why that's the case.

> A covered call is not the same thing as a short call. Those are two different things. No wonder you dont get this basic fact. You don't even know what a covered call is. You think it's a naked call. Jesus Christ.

All [covered calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp) are [short calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short-call.asp#:~:text=A%20short%20call%20is%20a,option%20will%20fall%20in%20price.) but the vice versa is not true, the same way all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Thank you — someone who gets it. Amazing how some millennial who [discovered options less than a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/g69h3z/pl_tracking_for_options_assigned/) and now thinks he understands them, but missed out on the fundamentals: a covered call is for extracting extra value from existing positions when the underlying stock isn’t expected to rise. One shouldn’t hope they actually get exercised."
03/22/2021,stocks,"
>The best thing that can happen to you when you write a covered call is for the stock price to dip below the strike + before exercise and stay below that level until after the option expires,

No that's incorrect. You want it over the strike price so you can sell the shares for say $100 instead of $99.99 or less. If it dips below the strike, you have less money. 100> 99.99.

> then shoot up. That's how you actually maximize your profit.

And that's where your mistake is. You're just cheating by tagging on a profitable trade *after* the covered call is over. After expiry, you don't have a covered call anymore. If you're being completely fair in your comparison, you'd have sold your shares at market price, completely closing the trad and returning you to the original state.

>You're bearish short-term with a covered call 

No, bullish. You want those shares sold for as much as possible, not less than you bought them for. 

>and would be bullish after expiry if you didn't get exercised + continue to hold the shares.

Which is the same cheat from earlier. Nothing happens after expiry because the covered call is over. You're trying to make money from a different event entirely. 

>They're also correct that in their scenario where the stock price jumped up only with no dip preceding, it would have been far better to have sold a put than a covered call. I'm happy to write out an example using current options prices on any stock if you really can't understand why that's the case.

No, incorrect. A short put is a covered call. This is basic knowledge and inarguable. Go ahead, write out the example. Just be sure to use the same strike, make sure they have the same EV, and you have to buy and sell the shares at CC open and expiration, respectively. You'll get identical results. 

>All [covered calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp) are [short calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short-call.asp#:~:text=A%20short%20call%20is%20a,option%20will%20fall%20in%20price.) 

No, covered calls have 100 shares of stock, making them delta positive. The term does not refer to the call alone, but to the pair as a whole.

>You're focusing on semantics here because 

Because words matter? 

>your argument that you would ideally want your covered calls to be exercised is completely wrong.

What do you have against max profit? You prefer less profit? You'd rather sell your shares for less money?

We have identical accounts.  I make a covered call at 100 on XYZ that goes to 101. Your ABC covered call goes to 99. Whose account is worth more?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Ok you straight up don't understand how options work and what you're saying doesn't make sense.

We can take a look at literally any stock's call and put options, and you'll see that for any stock, if you're bullish you'll make more by selling a put than a covered call (because selling a put is a bullish strategy and a CC is bearish). I'm going to list a few examples to drive home the point, because you can do this with literally any stock.

- We have 100 shares of Ford, current stock price is $12.94. Looking at options with strike price of $13 expiring this Friday (roughly at the money). Calls are selling for $26, puts are selling for $43. Lets say the stock price rises to $30. If you sold a CC, it would've exercised at the $13 strike, so your total value is the call premium ($26) plus value from the sale of the stock ($1300) for a total of $1,326. If you sold a put, your put did *not* exercise, so your total value is the put premium ($43) plus the market value of your stock ($3,000) for a total of $3,043. You have more money selling the put.
- We have 100 shares of Tesla, current stock price is $652.20. Looking at options with a strike price of $750 expiring on Mar 17, 2023 (OTM with calls and ITM with puts). Calls are selling for $24,325 while puts are selling for $32,550. Lets say the stock price jumps to $800. If you sold a CC, it would've exercised at the $750 strike, so your total value is the call premium ($24,325) plus value from the sale of the stock ($75,000) for a total of $99,325. If you sold a put, it would *not* have exercised at the $750 strike, so your total value would be the put premium ($32,550) plus the market value of your stock ($80,000) for a total of $112,550. You have more money selling the put.
- We have 100 shares of GoPro, current stock price is $13.48. Looking at options with a strike price of $5 expiring on April 16th (ITM with calls and OTM with puts), calls are selling for $908 and puts are selling for $1. Lets say the stock price goes up to $15. If you sold a CC, the option was exercised your total value is the call premium ($908) plus value from the sale of the stock ($500) which comes out to $1,408. If you sold a put, the option was not exercised and so your total value is the put premium ($1) plus the market value of your stock ($1,500) for a total of $1,501.
- Choose literally any stock with options and any strike price + expiry and I'd be happy to do a type up for that as well. You will *always* make more money selling a put over selling a covered call if the stock is bullish, because selling a put is a bullish strategy and selling a CC is bearish.

You would *never* sell a covered call of a stock if you're expecting the stock price to rise well beyond the strike price of that call, because you will nearly always have made more money by just holding the stock in that scenario. Generally the only time selling a covered call would be more profitable than just holding the shares is if the share price were to drop - that's what makes selling a CC a bearish strategy. The only notable exception I can think of to that is if the external value of the call increases the call premium more than the potential profit you lost by selling at the strike price instead of current market value (you can actually see that with the Tesla example). Even in those cases you're always hoping the stock price doesn't rise higher (so you're bearish) and in every single one of those cases, if you had sold a put instead of a covered call you would have made more money.

> We have identical accounts. I make a covered call at 100 on XYZ that goes to 101. Your ABC covered call goes to 99. Whose account is worth more?

This really shows the depth of your lack of understanding of options - what you're saying is nonsensical. You're basically comparing a call option to itself and are saying ""see, there's less value when the stock price goes lower!"". The alternative to selling a covered call is to not sell and *just hold the stock*, and as explained above, the value you get from a covered call will generally only be higher than the value from just holding the stock if the stock price decreases. That's what makes it an inherently bearish strategy - selling covered calls only really makes sense when you're expecting the stock price to decrease (or at least not rise higher than the strike, if strike is higher than current price)."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Frustrating, huh? It’s like it just doesn’t click for him why someone would write a covered call versus a short put. He’s hung up on the “equivalence of value” (put-call parity) he read about, but missed out on the practical application. Looking back at his posts, it’s no wonder; he skipped the basics."
03/22/2021,stocks,"You aren't doing the math correctly in any of your examples. If you sell the put, you have no shares. If you sell the covered call, you have to buy 100 shares. You need to compare 1 put to 1 call+100 shares.

Like here. First of all, you violated put call parity with bad price quotes. The put should be $.60. Second, you forgot to deduct the cost of the shares from the CC. 1408-1348 = 60. Identical to the put. It's 60 either way.

 >You would *never* sell a covered call of a stock if you're expecting the stock price to rise well beyond the strike price of that call, because you will nearly always have made more money by just holding the stock in that scenario.

We aren't discussing just holding stock. The choices were covered call or short put. That's it.

It's not nonsensical. It makes perfect sense. Would the account value be higher if the stock went to 99 or 101? There's only one correct answer...101.

>The alternative to selling a covered call is to not sell and *just hold the stock*,

No, if you don't sell a covered call, you'd have 0 shares since the shares are a part of the covered call.

You should already have the shares if you're trying to do a covered call - you would almost never buy 100 shares just to do a covered call. That would make no sense because it would always be better to buy a put instead.

Are three professional organizations enough to tell you you're wrong?

I've lost track of the number of ways you've been incorrect so far.  You've been told [a CC is bullish](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/WritingCoveredCalls_Webinar.pdf).  You've been shown (and linked to!) [a P&L graph](https://cdn.optionseducation.org/OCC/media/OIC/Images/strategies-advanced-concepts/strategies/covered-call/covered-call.gif?ext=.gif) that shows a covered call is profitable to the right, when shares rise. You've been told a covered call is delta-positive, so you profit when it rises. You've presented bad math, then ignored it when called on it. You've failed to do the accounting correctly, not deducting the cost basis of shares, then just ignored that completely.

&#x200B;

>Like here. First of all, you violated put call parity with bad price quotes. The put should be $.60. Second, you forgot to deduct the cost of the shares from the CC. 1408-1348 = 60. Identical to the put. It's 60 either way.  
>  
>I literally quoted what the current market price was for those options.

Here's another novice error, quoting me options prices on a Sunday for prices that would never, ever fill because they violate put-call parity. And that's right after I told you not to do that very thing!  But you did it anyway. Because you don't know what put-call parity is, you failed to notice. Thanks for the $40 arbitrage opportunity!  Infinite money cheat!

Your prices are invalid but you lack the education to understand why.  When the prices were corrected to real price that would actually be possible, you were shown that the short put is equivalent to the covered call. And then you completely ignored that lesson and persisted in your ignorance.

&#x200B;

>I provided links to the definitions of what a short call is and what a covered call is. A covered call is a type of short call. If you're too stubborn to accept that I don't know what to tell you.

And here, too.  Another mistake.  Your very own link clearly states that a covered call is an ""investor selling call options owns an equivalent amount of the underlying security.""  It's not selling a call. It's selling a call \*\*and owning 100 shares\*\*.  The shares are part of the covered call! They aren't a separate entity!

&#x200B;

>You should already have the shares if you're trying to do a covered call - you would almost never buy 100 shares just to do a covered call.

And yet again, your own link, which you didn't read, says "" If the investor simultaneously buys stock and writes call options  against that stock position, it is known as a ""buy-write"" transaction.""  Imagine that.  A buy-write transaction.  Y'know, like the order type that's on your ticket.  Because people do it.  All the fuckin' time.

yes, absolutely. in fact, research from universities all over the world shows that value investing is the only strategy that will give you an edge over the long-term. 

value investing is not a quick strategy, it can take years to pay off. but it will pay off over time.

The USS Reagan has had many many issues from its stationing outside of the area after the earthquake. But fled when the plant exploded. 

Since, a 20KM area has been completely off limits to the population (uninhabitable for no one knows how long yet) There was a larger (40km I think, for about 9 years) but eventually the Japanese govt has allowed some population to return. There are massive amounts of radioactive soils and waste buried within the radius, there are massive 300,000 gallon containers of stored radioactive waters waiting to be dumped. This is one plant, one plant. 

Our population will not allow this to happen if another meltdown happens in the US. The future of nuclear technology has to change from fission to fusion in order for this tech to make a long time impact.

A house has an alarm for emergency purposes. The alarms are used to warn the population of dangerous radiation releases.

FYI, a pack of rods, about 10-15 ft long are placed in a pool of water (edit: with and additional set of rods), this water heats up and then used to create steam. This steam is used to turn turbines which create electricity. 
Edit: there are also a set of neutral rod that is used to stop the reactions.

This same turbine concept is used in LNG plants, or coal. Hydroelectric dams use large pipes of water to turn a similar type of turbine that generates electricity also."

Coal plants release more toxicity and radiation than nuclear.  Flight attendants and Pilots get more radiation than nuclear workers.  Your fear is because you don't understand what is going on.  Fukishima was a accident that involved 2 beyond design events at the same time.  Chernobyl was due to poor design and operators violating multiple operating protocols.

I did something similar and kind of dumb with AMC back in january, I had bought shares at 2.88 and was about to sell it in premarket at $23... but told myself oh lets wait and see how high this can go. 

The stock then just went straight down at open, I tried to sell, my order wasn't being filled so I cancelled the sale order and I panic sold about 60% of my stocks at the lowest point of the day overall I still managed to sell at an average of $15, but it was dumb as hell. If I just sold in premarket I would have done more than 15k and ended up making 9k a few minutes later. Still great gains, but I lost 6k just being way too greedy.

The sad part is that BB was a much bigger part of my account and when BB got close to $30 I told myself, nah I am not selling, I made this mistake already today and I still own those shares sitting at like +5% instead of +300% haha"

03/22/2021,stocks,"Let me simplify it for you and say yes, putting as much as you can into AAPL is going to nearly guarantee you profit as long as you hold it. 

Why? Apple has an incomprehensible amount of free cash. Their capability ceiling is enormous, they can enter and dominate large markets as they choose. They also do this very carefully, their acquisition strategy is aggressive but economic. 

Looking to the EV Future, Apple is one of the leading battery companies and this gets overlooked. They have an ability to turn their suppliers into dominant players just through commitment.

Finally, their brand is alive. Apple has passed the point of being just a company, they’re a living breathing force that has withstood the test of time. Their flexibility and agility in their supply chain is also world class

Apple is down $20 from its all time high and the market has dictated this, not anything from the company. Look at it this way, the market has allowed discounted entry based on external factors which are basically unrelated to the firms competitiveness. 

Long apple in LEAPS and shares. Leaps are call options with long expirations, I recommend buying in the money long dated apple calls or just shares. Avoid short calls and be careful if you’re using margin to allow liquidity for a decline of up to 20%."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Indexes are a good start but I wouldn’t get too hung up on dividends. As others have said they are just a less tax efficient way of returning share holder value. Dividends are good for people who have huge amounts of invested and can live off that. You definitely some growth stocks in there. Most of the dividend stocks are traded at the same levels they were 2 years ago. And for what, a measles 2-3% per year? Might as well stick to bonds at that point. There are so many innovative companies out there with multi bagger potential and it would be a shame to pass them up. 

Take your HPE pick for example. It sounds like your only reason for keeping it is the dividend. There so many better companies in the tech space. MSFT for example has an excellent track record and plenty of potential.

I think you need to recalibrate your standards. “Not losing 15% or more over the long term” is not good shape. The market has historically returned something in the area of 8% per year. That is the benchmark. Anything less is underperforming. It doesn’t make sense to settle for just a 2-3% dividend. Obviously there other favors to consider like time horizon and all that but goal is to beat the market. If your picks don’t outperform the indexes, then mathematically is make sense to just invest in index funds."

I'm just a beginner in the weirdest time of stocks since, and even then, every single time a company as a huge boom of +50% in a week, there's always a reason and I just wanted to if anyone had news updates. These big changes don't happen for no reason.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Thank you! You make a good point about a lot of the rich/premium being Apple consumers. I hadn't considered that in my DD. I suppose the crucial point there will be how Apple proceeds. 

Right now it's clear Peloton has the lead and advantage, but I agree that if Apple manages to grow their content, gain reputation in that area, and improve their metrics, they would be a serious competitor in the same market. For now, I think Peloton is a pretty safe hold for a year, but Apple is worth keeping an eye on."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Likewise, thanks for your input. :)  I agree with you regarding their brand. Both the brand and the content are going to be crucial for them to maintain their lead. In that regard, I'm taking a bit of a leap of faith, but I consider their marketing record so far to have been good, so I'm quite optimistic. I'm still going to be pretty conservative with the amount I risk though."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Thanks very much for your input! My disadvantage is that I haven't used any of the products so I'm just going on secondhand research, so it helps me a lot to be able to read firsthand experience from people like yourself. I wasn't aware so much gym equipment was badly made, so I'll be taking that into account in my future DD. It's good to know as well that you find the gamification and content very positive. Those are two aspects that draw me to the product. I hope to get some equipment in the future, and I know that a big factor will be which company has the best content. Although it can change, it looks like Peloton is the clear winner for now.

Anyway, I really appreciate you sharing your experience with it. It's very helpful."
03/22/2021,stocks,"Thank you! Yes, I agree. I think the appearance of it being a ""covid"" buy is what's brought a lot of bears on, and, while it might slow the growth, they're discarding the continuing influence of it, as well as the whole future of remote work and people like yourself who enjoy the pleasure and convenience of exercising at home. It might end up being a long hold, but I think ultimately it will be a profitable one.

That's cool you're getting a Peloton. My disadvantage in all this is not being able to get much in the way of firsthand opinions or experience. If you don't mind and if you remember later, I'd love to hear about your experience with it once you've used it a bit. :)"

03/22/2021,stocks,"Thanks very much! The idea of gamifying it through leaderboards and the like does sound very good, and it's good to know that it's effective for him. I may end up being a future customer myself since I hear a lot of good things about it."

It’s just that people in general, outside of connoisseurs, don’t understand how to adequately drink wine, whisky, tequila, etc. They drink it like water 😅

To add to your post, they produce at most around 1.634m bottles of wine per annum on 227acres. With an average price of around $38.25, gross sales would be $62.5m per annum on the absolute high end if they were to sell directly to the consumer strictly. They don’t and unload somewhere between 90-95% of their wines at wholesale prices, so probably in the $8-13 range. So 90% wholesale, 1.47m bottles or so at wholesale pricing on the high end of $13 a bottle, gross sales would be $19.1m. Does this seem like a company worth having a present market cap at $2.19b? Definitely not. It’s merely the going public hype that’s plagued the markets over the previous year. They make subpar wines, on the same level as Mondavi (another Napa estate) which is elevated by tourists whom miss the actual good estates such as Austin Hope, Kosta Browne, Peju, Far Niente, etc (for the same price points. Of course there are significantly better wines in Napa such as Promontory, Screaming Eagle, Bond, Harlan, etc)."

They can definitely make money and grow by appealing to devs who don't have the time or skills to implement their offerings, but thinking they're going to be some egaming giant seems laughable at their current state.  I personally need to see them getting multiple good titles on their platform to have any sort of interest.

> Morgan Stanley and cathie woods 

Morgan Stanley has $500k, and ARK has 0.21% of their portfolio in SKLZ.  They are making bets using fractions of pennies to them.  By all mean don't trust reddit comments, but don't blindly trust institutions either, especially when they're not actually committing substantial capital."
03/22/2021,stocks,"They did buy Livongo which makes blood pressure monitors or diabetes testing kits so that info can be transmitted during a Teladoc session... they do have first mover advantage, the strength of the moat has yet to be determined.  However, it is a nascent area will lots of growth ahead even with competitors. Most new companies are judged on revenue growth and not metrics like P/E. But with every stock, you can always say Hey Great Story but... at what price? Would like to see it come down another 20% and then it gets really interesting."
03/22/2021,stocks,"The Livongo acquisition makes sense cause its basically a medical hardware basis that is complementary to their software. But, I can start seeing the bigger picture here, the videoconference platform seems to be a gateway to access the medical data management business. 
Livongo was also tinkering around with that in their « personalized programs » around some health issues."
03/22/2021,stocks,If i do a stop limit trade where i want to sell the stock at a certain price (if it dips to that price) do i use a stop limit or a stop trade order?
03/22/2021,stocks,Interesting - thanks!
03/22/2021,stocks,I think Kanye’s impact is going to be massive. They’re giving him significant control over the brand as a whole. Everything from the clothing to the design and layout of the stores themselves. I’m in for about 7% of my portfolio and I’m buying the dip today + some 9/17 calls.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Gotta admit, this makes no sense to me. Aren't treasuries considered ""assets""? Wouldn't reinstating SLR mean they need to hold *more* treasuries to balance out all of the liabilities?"
03/22/2021,stocks,"Yes, I realized how long the Celica AWD came out, and how long ago the Supra Mk IV came out and was dropped.  These were management decisions.

And I realize how someone stated that the new Supra will be attracting new buyers.  How Lexus appeals to a different cachet of buyers as well.  These are also management decisions.

I'm pointing out that I've been invested in Toyota and Lexus vehicles longer than some here have been alive, and far longer than Reddit has existed.  

Maybe I have a different perspective is all.  One based upon the history of Toyota, and their steps to bring them to where they are today?

So if someone is criticizing, let THEM explain why THEY think that way.  What is their foundation, their background with the product and company.  

Feelz is good, but how about some actual anecdotal or other experiences?

E.g.  35 ft-lbs sufficient for the transaxle drainage fluid bolt in a Tundra, but it can come torqued to the extent that it takes 120 ft-lbs to break it loose.  That's hands on experience."

Single payer needs a single standard and a single user database.

03/22/2021,stocks,"Dude, you and I both know that that won't happen. The government will fuck the implementation of single payer away and use it as yet one more opportunity to help out their corporate donors.

03/22/2021,stocks,"If. Anything I read by experts says this scenario is very specific and unlikely to happen to someone like you or me. Those shares eventually get a FTD or the broker settles it. Thus any counterfeit share has an eventual death.  People talk of the hypothetical if someone sold a counterfeit share to you, which would be like a naked call, but that doesn't actually create a stock, it creates the right to buy a stock  so whatever share you receive is a real valid share. However, if hypothetically no real shares were available, you would not receive one and the broker would have to settle your purchase with you when the FTD happens."

03/22/2021,stocks,"I'm still undecided.  Sure, you get some kind of sentiment for a stock, but imo some people are bullish on stocks that are just plain trouble.  For example (this happened a few times): stock XXXX is rumored to be deeply in dept, might file for chapter 11 and lawyers all over it but there's always this one guy on Twitter that will be ""MACD for XXXX just reversed, great stock for a great price!""  

Basically, I made twitter part of my DD/research for stocks, but it's just for stock sentiment, and makes up for about 10% of that.  I would trust Reddit or Yahoo Conversations over Twitter for stock sentiment."

03/22/2021,stocks,They have lower business due to covid. A lot of their customers are in airlines and hospitality. Those are downsizing contracts due to obvious downturn. When things open up you can see as jigh as 50% growth.
03/22/2021,stocks,I want to buy in at $19 but I'm not sure this company will be the explosive pick for that segment of the market. So many players in cloud management systems
