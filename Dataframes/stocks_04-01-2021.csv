04/01/2021,stocks,"Microsoft, they are probably the next company to jump a lot and after today’s news they will go even higher!"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Apple, Microsoft, Amazon are three companies everyone should have in their account, especially at that age"
04/01/2021,stocks,"I like $PHIL, $SRMX and $HMBL. They are just ones for you to look at not financial advice. Put your money in what fits for you.

Edit: $TGGI for the bonus look

Edit 2: Cole’s Notes

$HMBL : put Facebook market place, YouTube, ticket master, crypto, paypal all in one app is Humbl

$SRMX : working with Microsoft and T-mobile on IOT. Has a 5G chip that is already compatible with 6G. Their products can turn your house into iron mans house.

$PHIL : Building a Dimond exchange comparable to Dubai’s. Industrial packing wrap. Lux fund. Gold mines.

$TGGI : Healthy nano wine from China.

Edit 3:
If it was not obvious this is an over simplification of all the companies, do your own DD, I might of missed or miss interpreted the info."
04/01/2021,stocks,"For a safer long term bet... Alphabet, Amazon.

For possible bigger gain short term and good to hold long... SNOW and Fastly since they are both down 40+% from their 52-week high??

Would welcome opinion/thoughts on those pics. I actually picked up some SNOW and Fastly the other day with that thought. Would like to add to my Alphabet and Amazon position for long term."
04/01/2021,stocks,Save and move out?
04/01/2021,stocks,COIN
04/01/2021,stocks,What was the news today? I saw the 20 billion contract yesterday
04/01/2021,stocks,And Disney.
04/01/2021,stocks,+1 for humbl
04/01/2021,stocks,"I just moved back in actually. Figured i could save 15-20k a year on rent and just put that towards my future! 

I'll move out when i can afford 10 Cybertrucks :-)"
04/01/2021,stocks,Nice good luck.... Disney apple smh etf might be a few decent ones to start a little research on
04/01/2021,stocks,Smooth brain.

04/01/2021,stocks,"lmao, tbh there so many people trying to predict or explain how the market works that it makes me stay off reddit sometimes😂"
04/01/2021,stocks,So are people!
04/01/2021,stocks,So true. I’ve done much better selling to open vs buying to open.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Well since we're all trying to put our hard-earned money somewhere, I think it makes sense to have a general notion of what you're doing and why, no?

As I said, I was just sharing the way I see things.  It's not the right way or the best way or any of that.  Just sharing where I'm at with it and hoping to generate discussion."
04/01/2021,stocks,At this point for me it’s just entertaining.... this guy is new to investing and thinks he’s a genius playing 50 percent stocks 50 percent in a retirement account
04/01/2021,stocks,Yeah I was not saying that toward you personally. Did 1 year in economic and got my college degree in finance. It's always nice to hear what people have to say but the thing is that so many people say different things while there's obviously some factors that aren't evaluated by some and etc that those market explanations always have flaws and can't always be accurate.
04/01/2021,stocks,"I have no idea where you got that I think I'm a genius, given the multiple disclaimers I put in my post.  I just felt like sharing where I'm at with it at the moment."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I agree with you, and I mentioned that in my post, actually!  Like I said, I don't expect this to change the game or anything, lol.  It's just fun for me to share and see what I get back.

Fair enough, I can see that you weren't directing it at me.  You didn't even reply to me directly.  The other guy though said ""he (me) thinks he's a genius"".  Lol.  With those kinda folks around it's hard not to assume that people aren't being twats most of the time.

All the best."
04/01/2021,stocks,"If I invest in Skynet now, do I get to vote against the destruction of the human race?"
04/01/2021,stocks,Maybe buy stock in the company that shot the commercial instead 🤔
04/01/2021,stocks,"Serious opinion, it looks like a camera on wheels.  I'm always questioning if it can be weaponized and then realize the stupidity of that question. Of course it will. Will it be allowed to roam amongst the civilian population.  Of course it will. The science isn't why I'm against it, it's the applications that are a no for me."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Damn it is skynet isn't it Lol

All in on this one.  Maybe instead of extinction I can become a cyborg."
04/01/2021,stocks,"The commercial was shot using the camera from another knightscope vehicle.  They are becoming sentient,  they are creating their own standards of society and beauty. Soon they will divide into jock, cheerleaders and dorks."
04/01/2021,stocks,Another reason for a 50 bmg
04/01/2021,stocks,"True there is an ethical side to all of this, but with cops as bad as they are maybe it's a utilitarian dilemma?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Yeah, it *would* be cool but then I would have to own one."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I don't see the pope or the dali llama being in charge of these things,  worst case scenario is mall cops with a robot army."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I guess I'm a little skeptical, I used to work in retail and now I work in an Amazon FC and the company succeeded in the fulfillment center logistics by being efficient and they do a good job at it. Contrast that with a store and there's only so much you can do: if you have humans coming in, rooting around, moving stuff around and pawing at things you have to pay another human to put the shit back and reorganize it. It's just hard for that business model to to operate anywhere near the margins that a warehouse does. Then you factor in that the real estate in a storefront, even in a decaying mall, is so much more than the exurbs where they can plop down the FCs and make them 5 stories tall. 

The space in a fulfillment center just doesn't cost much, the inventory that's kept in a pod in the middle of a massive floor that's only accessed by robots and people fixing the robots, and the stuff is stored so much more densely than it could be in a physical retail environment. If the issue is that Amazon has capital tied up in stuff they're not turning over fast enough, why not try to squeeze the suppliers further- so the stuff gets shipped to Amazon's warehouse but Amazon doesn't own it or pay for it until its' sold? They do that with a lot of third-party vendors already. 

If Amazon's looking at it I assume they have a strategy to do it well, but it just seems like they're expanding into a lower-margin business just because."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Interesting. I think the idea of a true pop up store, like no renovations needed just operate which whatever space they can get their hands on without needing to pay for renovations and cosmetic renovations would be a good idea."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Not sure how this becomes successful. Instead of cheap DC space, now it occupies retail space and is only stuff people have said they don’t want online, people have to physically show up to get it, and it needs to be organized better than the random stocking they do in their DC. The only way I see this succeeding is if they basically can guarantee some good stuff at cheap prices and/or a great experience, but both will take much more effort than I think they are expecting"
04/01/2021,stocks,Oh my god! My SHW is down 66%! And why do I have 3 times as many shares?
04/01/2021,stocks,3-to-1 split.
04/01/2021,stocks,It’s called a split man... they split their shares u know like Apple and a lot of other cray big companies have done so everyone stock isn’t 879897 for a share
04/01/2021,stocks,Painting the world in *RED*
04/01/2021,stocks,A simple google search would have saved you time
04/01/2021,stocks," This post is not on the level 😂

I own SHW. The extra shares should be coming soon enough into the trading account.

Duck duck go and maybe some due diligence next time? Lol

🚀🌕"
04/01/2021,stocks,tom hanks
04/01/2021,stocks,I know little with the stock market so if you can buy fractional stocks why do they need to split it?
04/01/2021,stocks,"Why do that, when I can be called a moron by internet strangers"
04/01/2021,stocks,Majority of market is based on whole shares. lol
04/01/2021,stocks,I like your style
04/01/2021,stocks,If your broker is fucking around with April fools joke then its time to get a new broker.
04/01/2021,stocks,It's closed for Good Friday.

04/01/2021,stocks,"It’s a typo, they meant “It’s closed for good, Friday.” 

Stock market will be closed and no longer operating as of tomorrow. Sucks to see it go but fun while it lasted! Can’t have a stock market crash without a stock market."
04/01/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/01/2021,stocks,I'm going to enjoy waking up tomorrow without having the anxiety of checking my stocks before work. 😅
04/01/2021,stocks,Closed for a handful of holidays. Quick google search will tell you which.
04/01/2021,stocks,You can buy bonds until noon if you want
04/01/2021,stocks,Yes it’s closed. WTF am I supposed to do between 9:30 and 4? 😂

04/01/2021,stocks,TV/Film insider here -- before investing I would look into the recent WGA agreement and WME's plans to phase out packaging and reduce production ownership before investing. This whole movement towards big growth for these companies was predicated on the fact that they would be able to act as producers (as well as recent expansions into sports as you note) and in my view they have been a bit crippled recently. The agency had a big round of layoffs a few months ago.
04/01/2021,stocks,Who the hell is going to be “excited” for this IPO?
04/01/2021,stocks,Let me know if there are any other features I could add to it such like the local search and the dividend tracker.
04/01/2021,stocks,SPY average gains for April being 1.51%. This March was 3.64% and today alone was 1.18%. This year's should be interesting
04/01/2021,stocks,"While I'm sure WFC (Wells Fargo) investors would love the stock to have a PT of $75, I think you might have meant WDC? :)"
04/01/2021,stocks,Wasn't expecting to buy anything today but snagged 10 shares of PSFE. Interesting stock. I like their involvement in sports betting and anonymous card transactions. Trying to get a reasonable price point with the lockup ending the 18th of may or june
04/01/2021,stocks,Trading options in this market is definitely going to be fickle compared to buy anything and everything territory

04/01/2021,stocks,"They have some challenges due to continued effects from the pandemic. If you don't mind holding for the long term, this could be worth buying on the dips.

Don't expect major progress until 2022 so there's plenty of time to buy low."
04/01/2021,stocks,"They’ve underperformed the market for a decade. Low yield dividend, no real growth potential. I’ve held them before and was unenthused after further research. I would look at AWK or ECL instead for a water play."

04/01/2021,stocks,Thanks
04/01/2021,stocks,fantastic recap once again
04/01/2021,stocks,"Beam, no contest.

Edit: I own all 3, edit, beam, crspr heaviest in that order."
04/01/2021,stocks,"In order of largest %, I hold BEAM, CRSP, NTLA. CRSP is the furthest ahead, and likely to be the first to true clinical applications. BEAM seems to possibly have the best technology. I recently got into NTLA when they announced they had a base editor as well, and the stock didn’t really move that much so it seemed like a good buy.

I follow a channel on YouTube called Crispr talk where the guy posts regular updates in the field. He is of the opinion that should these therapeutics eventually work, the potential market will be so huge that many companies could succeed."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I have positions in Beam and Crispr. Crispr seem to be the furthest along and have had a lot of successful trials whereas Beam are newer, but have an edge with base editing, although there's a bit of controversy about that atm because NTLA have also just said they have discovered base editing and there's an argument over patents. 

It's really hard to pick a winner in this field and things are going to get murkier from here. I've heard smart people say it's an FDA lottery and it's just pure luck. I've heard smart people say no no no, it's a rising tide lifts all ships situation and all these companies will be winners in the long run. I've heard someone from ARKG basically state it's a combination of these two things and that luck will play a factor, which is why they've got so many small positions in so many companies rather than a few large conviction holdings like they have in other portfolios. Holdings like Teladoc and Exact Sciences could even be seen as stable anchors to protect the fund against the volatility of the smaller genomics holdings.

Who the winner is? Well that's the trillion dollar question (maybe literally). I like Beam, they are maybe the most disruptive right now, but that can change quickly and there's certainly a lot of risk at this early stage."
04/01/2021,stocks,I have ARKG so I don't have to choose in a field I realistically know nothing about.
04/01/2021,stocks,I would buy all 3
04/01/2021,stocks,"Exactly my sentiment. Let me know what you pick, I have some yolo money that i am looking to put into genomics."
04/01/2021,stocks,BEAM
04/01/2021,stocks,Watching this closely.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Of those 3 I would say BEAM. 

EDIT had some management issues iirc and CRSP is the most expensive one. 

Secret tip: CLLS

I am so heavy in CLLS it is ridicolous. Nobody knows them because everybody went out buying the 3 you mentioned, but actually CLLS has most of the gene editing patents. They are scaling their production atm. They basically have an off the shelf cure for cancer. Yeah you read that right. It's a fucking joke that they are trading at 800m. Cherry on top is that they have a 65% stake in CLXT. Which is swinging between 200-400mio market cap. Ark has 20% stake in CLLS btw"
04/01/2021,stocks,I went off the board and chose TWST
04/01/2021,stocks,Bio nano is my genomics play.
04/01/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/01/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/01/2021,stocks,That’s a really bold claim. Anything to back it up?
04/01/2021,stocks,"I like TWST, I own a lot"
04/01/2021,stocks,"I won't try to replicate excellent info out there on crspr vs base editing, but the latter promise to be the better tech, and that is beam (and to a new extent, ntla, which I unfortunately only own 50 shares of). Edit is the best value at current prices, crsp the worst, imo. I'd own more beam but thought I was smart when I sold half at $65 (as I entered under 20, and more than tripled in a few months). Oops."
04/01/2021,stocks,Which one exactly?
04/01/2021,stocks,CLLS having cancer cure.
04/01/2021,stocks,"It's called car-t cell therapy and actually known to work for a few years now. The thing is it is basically only used as a last resort at the moment and the therapy doesn't work for every kind of tumor afaik.

I am no medical professionel, but if you are interested in how it works you can google it or watch a few videos. The CEO of CLLS held a TED talk: https://youtu.be/8dnnnYCgbP4"
04/01/2021,stocks,"IP is rock solid, doing loads of stuff in computing (games with frontier developments) moving slowly away from the old tabletop model. 

Only concern would be valuation, not checked out what its trading at recently so can’t comment. Thats a dyodd thing.

Edit: cant comment in the difference but afaik gaw.l is the main stock"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Don't know your answer, but be wary of stocks that end with 'F'... That means foreign and some brokers charge as much as $50 a trade. Make sure of any fee before purchase and you're going to have to pay again when you sell."
04/01/2021,stocks,GAW.L is GW share listed on LSE. GMWKF is ADR on American exchange.
04/01/2021,stocks,"I think they will still be sticking primarily to the tabletop, but their new pushes into media, partnering with fan made animators, partnerships with Marvel to make comics and new video games will bring a lot of new players into the hobby. Speaking to store managers they had higher sales over the quarentine even with stores closed since everyone was locked inside with stimulus to fund their hobbies."
04/01/2021,stocks,Thanks for the heads up. I'll look into the fees from by broker.
04/01/2021,stocks,Float are the shares that are currently available in the market which is different than shares outstanding which are the number of shares that have been issued.  The float can change without issuing completely new shares.  These could be shares that were held by the company that are issued as part of stock options to employees or other shares that were otherwise restricted that are no longer restricted.
04/01/2021,stocks,Thank you. I appreciate your time.
04/01/2021,stocks,"1% per day is insane, that comes out to roughly a 3700% return in a year. The fact that you think that seems ""doable"" means you need to do a ton more research before fully diving in."
04/01/2021,stocks,"As another person stated, 1% daily is outrageous, especially if you’re targeting a 1% profit which you’d have to adjust for your future tax obligation. Better just focus on building long-term and not get too cute in my opinion. Have to look at the effort-return trade off too."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Ok, you already got some flak for the '1% per day' thingy so I'm not going to add to that. 

However; why would you want to swing trade in the first place? You'll just be paying more transaction fees and as I read your post you're only doing it with a few hundred dollars so even if you get a good result percentage wise, your 'hourly wage' would still be shite.

Besides, 'buy and hold' has been proven to be more effective than speculation on what will go up within the next few days."
04/01/2021,stocks,Even .1% every day is high and pretty unsustainable. 1.001^252 = 1.286... ~29% return. Doable but really fucking hard to sustain over 10 years.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Well, yes and no. You are not going for a 3700% return, but 1% a day 252 times ( the number of trading days) just 1%."
04/01/2021,stocks,"check your math there friend. 

Day 1: $100 invested, 1% profit is $1

Day 2, $101 invested, 1% profit is $1.01

Day 3, $102.01 invested, 1% profit is (rounded) $1.02

Day 4, $103.03 invested, 1% profit is (rounded) $1.03

Day 5 $104.06 AND, I am not going to keep this up

five day return alone is: 4%...

Long story short, exactly 1% a day yields an annual return of 1242.4% If you started with $100 and earned 1% over every possible weekday (I didn't bother to deduct holidays) you would have $1242 in profit, and a final investment balance of $1342.

If you are saying you will take $100, make $1, pocket that dollar then only re-invest the $100, then... well you will still make $252, you'd feel silly, and you have a 252% annual return even if you didn't reinvest. 

Clearly you are overlooking the fact that nobody on earth makes an annual return of 252%, let alone 1200%. the flaw is you cannot sustain that every day and you likely never pick a group of stocks that in aggregate after all the up days and down days, lands you at those kinds of returns."
04/01/2021,stocks,"going for 1% per day is still compounding, 1% per day for 252 days is still a 1200% return. It doesn't matter that you're reducing the resolution to only look at individual days, it still comes out to a 1200% yearly return which is ludicrous. Just start with Paper Money for a few months and see how you do."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I'll keep it up for you :)   You're math is exactly correct and I want the trade secret to get just 1% a day.   1200% a year would make it so I could retire with 2.6 mil after 3 years **off of  an initial  $1500 investment**.  If I'm not bored after 3 years and kept it up one more year I'd have **$32.3 mill.**   So - OP if you figure it out please message me.     If I do the same I'll share as well.   Oh,  and somewhere in there you have to pay taxes, but I'd be okay with it if I was turning those kinds of numbers!    Oh, and if you're holding a reserve for opportunities you'll cut into your return.

04/01/2021,stocks,"AT&T has so much debt. They are the most diversified in terms of business, but wouldn’t touch them until they have their debt under control. T-Mobile is doing aggressive growth and I think it’s often underrated when people speak about telecom companies. Verizon is also a good one as they are doing very well with 5G. Buffet also bought it, so it was undervalued. I’d go with Verizon maybe? It’s a tough call..."
04/01/2021,stocks,TMUS if you want the winner in telecom for at least the next couple of years. DISH if you want higher upside and don't mind the added risk.
04/01/2021,stocks,I too own T for the dividend mostly my thinking has been along the same lines as your post I am looking to start taking my dividends that I normally reinvest out and putting them into something else.  I am not looking to sell yet I think with the movement we have seen lately it still has some upward movement in it at least until I can read up on Bidens new plan for 5G rollout in rural areas. Whoever the government backs in this to expand these networks might be the play since they will subsidize the costs.
04/01/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't worry about growth per se for any of these companies as much as will they be very relevant and take a bigger market share? Their all huge companies. Realistically how much more growth financially can you expect from behemoth companies. 

Buffet has a stake in VZ so I'm assuming of the bunch it's financials will be the best from a value play haven't really looked at it myself."
04/01/2021,stocks,"T Mobile share price has gone 10x in less than a decade which is just fantastic. How long can it continue as an aggressive growth company is a reasonable question. I think at some point the winds will shift, it will settle in at a stock price around $200 and then reverse split to $50. Start farting out dividends like every other telco, but who knows?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"5G is an odd duck.  It doesn't have any real specifications,  it's just using the 5th generation technology.  

Different frequencies (wavelengths) have different capabilities and limitations.   Lower frequencies have more pennetrating ability (you can receive signal through a wall), but are slower and can't carry as much data. Extremely high frequencies bounce off objects (need line of sight) but can carry much more data.

T mobile after their merger with Sprint has a lot of mid range frequency spectrum.   VZ had a lot of the very high range in cities,  and just paid a ton at the recent auction for mid.  ATT has lower frequencies and because of the existing debt didn't pick up as much in the auction. 

ATT doesn't seem to know what they want to be when they grow up (cell? Streaming?  Satellite?).  VZ wants to rebuild the ""can you hear me now"" with good 5G.  T mobile is a real competitor because of the low debt and existing frequency,  but doesn't have as many customers and customers aren't switching very often. 

I got 264 shares of VZ from VOD in 2010 so I don't have a cost basis. I don't plan on selling them, ever, but I don't know how any of this will turn out."
04/01/2021,stocks,"That's what worries me with ATT, it's undervalued for a reason. The debt load is pretty crazy. I'm pretty sure Verizon has a similar but slightly smaller amount of debt, but they don't pay as much of a dividend which frees them up to pay that off. I think Verizon will be my move because I'll still get dividends but from a company that isn't currently hemoraging money. 

T mobile from people's sentiment is very underrated, but the lack of dividend turns me off. I also don't need more risk in my port, selling att which is slow but albeit relatively safe to replace with something that doesn't pay dividends and is valued at a growth stocks premium doesn't make much sense to me. I bet T mobile for the long is a good buy though, Im not bashing it at all. Just my personal opinion."
04/01/2021,stocks,"If you're going to invest in Verizon I'd wait until there's some resolution on their merger with TracFone. If it's blocked or large divestments are required I could see them dipping significantly in the short-term.

Verizon's spectrum position is also shit at least until the end of this year (C-band A block is freed up then) and their mmWave plans seem to have been massively scaled back, so I fully expect things to get worse for them before they get better.

Hell, at least AT&T has HBO and FirstNet."
04/01/2021,stocks,"T-Mobile just announced they're ditching TVision so they're not going to be competing in every area, but I'd expect continued growth from switching and fixed wireless rollout over the next few years.

Not 10x growth though. What Legere did with that company was a masterpiece of marketing and long-term growth strategy."
04/01/2021,stocks,Yeah it’s incredible. He basically invented a character for himself to pop play on TV and twitter and then ran with it. If he dusts off his boots for a final act I’m buying as many shares of whatever it is as I can afford.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Since it somehow hasn't been said clearly yet:

WASH RULE LOOKS BOTH FORWARD AND BACK FROM THE LOSS SALE

You cannot game the system by buying first then selling for a loss on the older stock. You'll add the loss to your new cost basis of stock bought within 30 days before or after the loss event"
04/01/2021,stocks,I’ve wondered the same thing and it seems nobody understands what you’re asking.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Nope. You’ve gotta hold that group of stocks for 30 days if you are planning on selling in the red and rebuying to avoid a wash sale. If you sell ALL of them in the green, no wash. If you sell HALF in the green and rebuy before holding the group for 30 days, it’s a wash."
04/01/2021,stocks,Is this a joke?
04/01/2021,stocks,"No, if the stock is @ 15, then you buy and sell at that price, no matter what your purchase price was."
04/01/2021,stocks,Is the stock worth 15 or 25? If you can buy at 15 why would anyone else buy it from you for 25 (at that time obviously)
04/01/2021,stocks,"Does it have to do with taxes (losses)? Otherwise I cannot figure out you’re asking about, the stocks are not unique and if you sell right away it is no different then if you just market buy and then instant market sell"
04/01/2021,stocks,No you can't..  you have to wait 11 days I believe
04/01/2021,stocks,"As far as I am aware, the wash sale counts if you rebuy the stock 30 days before or after the sale. So, no, you cannot reverse the wash sale by buying before the sale."
04/01/2021,stocks,"No.

Edit: in your example your current broker will trigger a wash sale on your reporting.

You can theoretically do it with different brokers but it doesn't mean its allowed. Especially considering that in the long term you're going to show a sale of the second lot of shares at a gain.

The larger amount of the loss you're trying to claim, the more scrutiny from the IRS. If it's a few hundred dollars like in your example, then it's not worth the hassle."
04/01/2021,stocks,"your stocks are worth what they’re worth, doesn’t matter what you bought them for.  If you plan to take a loss and write it off you have to worry about a wash.
Just hold what you have or add to your position to average down

No financial advice I’m a clown just like everyone else"
04/01/2021,stocks,"You can only buy or sell at the CURRENT bid or ask price.
When you buy more shares at a different price, you will the own shares at the new average price of all those shares you own.

Eg:. Buy 10 shares @ $20.  Buy 10 more shares @ $10.  You average them out...you have 20 shares @ $15.  In this case you 'averaged down'.  

Hope it's clearer."
04/01/2021,stocks,"No.  Think about what you're saying and how simple it would be for anybody to do this.  No one would ever incur capital gains taxes if this was a thing...  You can't even do that with a 'similar' version of the originally security, at least not legally for tax purposes"
04/01/2021,stocks,THANK YOU. This is what I needed.
04/01/2021,stocks,"He's trying to do the same stock separate so he can claim the loss on one set while buying back in on the other. That way he stays with the same amount of shares but has the write off. 

To answer the question - No way to make that happen.

To why everybody has a issue understanding the question, OP is really out of the box on this one."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Thanks for answering, but you didn't understand the question."
04/01/2021,stocks,Lmao re read
04/01/2021,stocks,You didn't understand my question. Thanks anyway.
04/01/2021,stocks,Almost TOO far out of the box
04/01/2021,stocks,Sorry 🤷🏻‍♂️
04/01/2021,stocks,"That really depends on your broker/platform. on Trading212 the sale will be marked at a loss, provided that the averaging down of the stock has not brought you back in the green. So in your example your averaging down to 20, and the sale of 20 shares will register at a loss of  100. It wont register the sale at a loss of 200, unless you sell the position first before buying new ones. Don't know your platform/broker so YMMV

Thanks for clearing up your original, makes more sense what you are asking."
04/01/2021,stocks,That sounds like a less confusing question
04/01/2021,stocks,"It’s my understanding you only have to worry about wash / not being able to claim a loss, if you reinvest in the same stock at the lower amount within a 30 day time frame.  Sounds like you just want to cut your losses?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Hmm... But my broker doesn't ""average"" the shares, they trade first-in/first-out. So wouldn't the 20 shares I sell still be a loss of $200?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"I still want to be invested in the stock. I believe the stock will go up. However, in the event it is a long hold, I'd like to have the loss noted here. 

I was originally going to average down, but I don't want that much into this one stock. 

Is what I'm saying making sense?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Well in that case, theoretically that could happen as you see it, and you use the loss against any future potential gains vs taxes etc.

 But honestly, ask your broker - we certainly have no insight into their workings and policies - or did you already try that?"
04/01/2021,stocks,Definitely clearer.
04/01/2021,stocks,"All of them. Nasdaq was king the first six weeks of 2021, and I was beating the shit out of it. Since then, I’m still beating the Nasdaq, but the boomers are beating me, so I don’t consider that beating the market anymore. Gotta beat them all or it’s just cherry picking imo."
04/01/2021,stocks,Any time I make money I feel I beat the market
04/01/2021,stocks,"Although I track my portfolio against other indexes, the main comparison is vs the index fund I could be passively buying instead. In my case that's the FTSE Global All Cap (Acc)."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Personally, if I beat the best performing index (DJIA, S&P 500, or NASDAQ) I consider myself as beating the market."
04/01/2021,stocks,"It is hard to do a direct comparison because you need to take into account risk.  If I feel the market is unstable so I keep much more of my accounts in cash then I might underperform a index but I also undertook less risk; if things would have turned out different then I might have overperformed and made  some good purchases at good prices that have not come to fruition yet.

Overall this is what I do.  I extrapolate my net worth over future years.  Growth is based on typical S&P performance, my savings rate, expected returns from other investments, etc..  If I end a year higher than the projection then I am pretty happy.  It all comes down to whether I am getting ahead every year."
04/01/2021,stocks,Beating the market is beating VTI or F*** ya motha
04/01/2021,stocks,"If you made $50 you beat 90% of the people here. 

I never compare myself to the market, I compare my performance against my needs and my plan."
04/01/2021,stocks,LMAO dang boomers smh. Thanks! True about cherry picking.
04/01/2021,stocks,"This is the way

The way i see the “beating the market” idea is that you’re doing better than the alternative of just investing in the whole market

If you would pick SPY over QQQ to invest in longterm than judge “beating the market” on whether or not you’re beating SPY because thats what you would have been in otherwise"
04/01/2021,stocks,True that!
04/01/2021,stocks,Always compare to the market because if you aren’t beating the market then you shouldn’t be buying individual stocks to begin with.
04/01/2021,stocks,What?
04/01/2021,stocks,This is correct.

04/01/2021,stocks,Why is TER hardly ever mentioned in relation to TSM? They will benefit enormously from this as well - TSM has been their largest customer the past few years.
04/01/2021,stocks,What about ASML? Their EUV technology enables production of those chips with for example 3nm processes which TSMC requires. I think they’ll be benefitting very well if not the most from this investment.

04/01/2021,stocks,"They're a competitor of TSM (not really, in practice; UMC are nowhere near as advanced, specialising in 28nm and above fab), so they won't benefit from this.

- If you are bagholding and the price happens to move where you'd realize a small loss instead of the big loss you were doing before, sell at a small loss

- Time sensitive instruments are cool and all, but whoever tells you that regularly trades in weeklies options is crazy or a liar. Nobody makes money with weeklies unless for immense strokes of luck

Public sentiment is a real thing and when the public thinks the companies or sector as a whole aren't going to make money in the future, despite the companies will most likely make very good profits in the next year or two, it's just not good enough.

Should have cut losses early enough before the loss got too big. I thought it would eventually go up, since the companies still make good money.

Also, ignore confirmation bias DD by other people. It's good to read them and understand more, but it's very important to think yourself and stuck with whatever plan you initially have. 

I was going to cut losses early until I kept reading comments that seem like good DD, so I kept holding instead of cutting losses. Then my losses became bigger and I regret. After I sold, the prices kept dropping further and I'm glad I didn't accumulate bigger losses

I've learned to diversify, and make my own decisions instead of trying to follow other people."

So, I really like Coursera and have taken some classes through them; I especially liked that they offered free courses during the opening days of the pandemic, it was just a cool move.

So, I was happy when their IPO came out because I wanted to buy some shares. I put in a limit buy last night for $45 for market open. I woke up, had my coffee, gave my son breakfast and checked my stocks around 12pm. I had 50 shares of COURS, but I was waayyy down. I didn’t pay it much heed until I saw it keep dropping and dropping. I check the price and it was around 50, and I though, “this isn’t right, I should be up $200, not down $250!”

Checked my order and I mistyped the 4 & 5. I set my limit for 54. I basically bought at the peak of the day right before it just dropped. I’m gonna hold it (it down almost $400 now) and just see what happens. Again, I like the stock. Sure, they aren’t profitable yet, but they are a real disrupter in the educational field I believe.

04/01/2021,stocks,"yeah but look at the positives, cuz it's similar to my scenario...
1. you didn't lose any real money, only paper money. you got freaked out, and now have FOMO just like i did. but don't get FOMO...it's paper money. 
2. perhaps you were overallocated to something volatile and was too much for your risk tolerance. everyone is different. i have learned sometimes it is better to de-risk and lose out on future gains so you can sleep at night. hindsight is 20/20. it's impossible to predict day to day moves i have found. you did what you thought was best at the time... go easy on yourself. who knows, the stock may go down at some point and you will have made a good choice.
3. but maybe you're a daytrader and this doesn't apply so much...but hopefully it does a bit"

04/01/2021,stocks,Yeah I heard that if you missed like 10 specific days in the last decade in the market it crippled your decades gains. Days like my portfolio had up today (and down last week) really make that seem possible.

04/01/2021,stocks,Yeah because you broke even. But let’s say you only make 500 on the new shares and you’re analyzing your investment without considering the wash sale adding to your new basis. You’re happy you’re up 500 and sell. Technically you lost 500 because you ignored the 1000 loss that was added to your basis.

04/01/2021,stocks,"Aphria will convert to tilray. If you plan to hold to end, might be better to see if the arb allows you to sell tilray to buy aphria and end up with more tilray after merge. I think you need to look at the net benefits. Im 5300 @apha shares"
04/01/2021,stocks,If you’re bullish. Do you think I should hold for long term? And what returns do you see in the next few years?
04/01/2021,stocks,Oh and short term?
04/01/2021,stocks,Distributor? No. Altria (MO) will be the largest distributor. Tilray may be the largest producer. Your play should be who’s going to distribute it. Which is the tobacco companies.
04/01/2021,stocks,What I’m wondering is if I should sell tlry for $100 loss or if it’s going to have a spike with the upcoming merge?
04/01/2021,stocks,I expect there will be movement based on apha earnings and  4/20 merge vote excitement. I am holding to gain but im not sure what the final sentiment will be. Trust your gut

04/01/2021,stocks,ok
04/01/2021,stocks," I've actually used several platforms. For what it's worth, here's my take:

I have most of my ""tech"" stocks in TD Ameritrade  
I have most of my ""value"" stocks in Fidelity  
I have an ETF portfolio in Schwab  
I have a handful of stocks in Webull  
I put a few stocks in Robinhood, then later closed that account

I have them separated like this because it helps me to organize them with each separate portfolio serving a different purpose (except for Webull, which I just opened to try out the platform).

**TD Ameritrade:** I like the look of the TD Ameritrade platform and the ease of trading; it's very intuitive and easy to understand for someone who doesn't do this very often. I dislike the charts on the TD Ameritrade website, however, they have a separate app called ""Think or Swim"" that has excellent charts. The problem with the ""Think or Swim"" app is that is really geared towards professional traders and is much more complex. It can be difficult to use if you are like me and only buying a few tickers and a few shares at a time. Think or Swim is great for day-traders and people who have lots of money to put in the market and do a lot of trading. It's overly complex for the casual trader.

My TD Ameritrade account was the first one I opened, and I may have a bias for that reason. I got used to it before opening the other accounts. I opened it based on reviews I read online, and I will say it's a great tool for the casual trader.

**Fidelity**: This platform is actually my favorite platform to use, but it is a little less intuitive in some regards than TD Ameritrade. I like the research tools here, and combined with the TD Ameritrade platform, I do most of my research on these two platforms. The charts on Fidelity are excellent. They are easy to use, easy to modify and easy to understand. They are also quite complete. The biggest shortcoming of Fidelity compared to TD Ameritrade is that prices shown on their main ""Positions"" page don't update on a frequent basis, whereas on TD Ameritrade, prices are mostly up-to-the minute. This is a relatively minor complaint, because you can always get a current price by updating the screen. Trading, especially options trading is not as intuitive on Fidelity, but once you get it figured out, it's still fairly easy for the novice. The screens are easy to read and contain a wealth of information. On TD Ameritrade, you have to go to multiple screens to get the same information that Fidelity puts on one screen.

**Schwab:** I opened this account mostly just to compare it to the other two. Of the three ""big boy"" platforms, this is the one I like the least. It contains less information than Fidelity, less research information than either Fidelity or TD Ameritrade and trading is less intuitive. That said, it's not like there is a huge difference, and if you start out using this one and get used to how it works, it is probably nearly as powerful as the other two.

**Webull:** Webull and Robinhood were both designed with younger people in mind. They are marketed to ""Millennial"" investors and they show it. Their research tools are minimal compared to the three listed above, however they do have ""Social Networking"" type functions. Of the two, Webull is more professional and has more tools than Robinhood. Both are designed for users of iPhones and other mobile devices. While they do have websites that work on desktop/laptop computers, that isn't their strength. I have a few stocks still in my Webull account, but I won't use it for much investing until it ""grows up"" a little bit.

**Robinhood:** I opened this account to see how it compared to the others, then closed it because it was worthless. (Technically, I didn't close it. You don't really close these accounts because you still need the information for tax purposes. I just took my money out and quit using it. The account is still ""active"").

People who have used Vanguard also seem to like it really well. I've never used it."

04/01/2021,stocks,"I will add my opinion on Vanguard 

Vanguard 

Vanguard is an app that is geared towards passive investing IMO, very easy to use for moving money into funds and accounts that won’t be touched too actively. I have my Roth IRA thru vanguard because they offer many low fee funds and have been around for hundreds of years, touting a great reputation. I will admire that the app is archaic and hard to navigate, but they have pushed Vanguard Beacon that has an easier UI. I highly recommend using Vanguard for passive investing and retirement accounts"
04/01/2021,stocks,"I use Fidelity, but it isn't as easy as Robinhood.  RH pissed me off with their GME BS (even though I didn't have any).  I don't like the idea that a platform can/will restrict trading.  If Fidelity tries it in the future, I'll move again.

2021-04-01 19:18:34,stocks,A company named Kelly b services mooned today I noticed that they have an average volume of 2000 and a much higher volume today of several thousand percent does anyone know why in the past this stock has mooned. It seems to be a pattern every few months.
04/01/2021,stocks,Its Kelly Services and they’re a staffing company. Possibly stock is up because more businesses are reopening after the pandemic and looking to recruit new workers.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Temp agency,  shocked it's soaring. Don't get too hyped on this stock."

2021-04-01 19:17:28,stocks,"Found Old Stock Certificates, Are They Worthless? My father recently gave me a couple physical stock certificates that my grandfather bought in the 70s-80s. I've tried looking up the two companies listed on the certificates in Google, the NYS Division of Corporations website, and on my brokerage app but I can't seem to locate these companies, or any company that used to be known as these two.

The companies are:

* APPLIED MANAGEMENT SCIENCES INC. (certificate issued 08/01/1989)

**EDIT:** Thanks to /u/Beholder88 
> Applied Management Sciences Inc: ""Applied Management Services was acquired by Aspen Systems in 1989. The Company offered survey and data analysis as well as business process re-engineering."" Aspen systems still seems to exist, per Google, but it looks like they're a private company as I can't find anything on stock for them. You're probably out of luck there.

* DEEP SEA TECHNIQUES, INC. (cert. issued 04/12/1973)

**EDIT2:** 

Just got off the phone with Fidelity, they were very kind but ultimately had no luck in researching Deep Sea Techniques, Inc. for me. I was told to attempt to locate the ""issuer"" listed on the stock certificate, but all I see is the transfer agent Continental Stock Transfer Company (trying to find out if they are now known as Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company). 

I actually located an old prospectus for Deep Sea which listed an old name they had, as well as an address. There's nothing located at the address, but I managed to locate an SEC News Digest article about Deep Sea Techniques, Inc. offering shares of common stock for public sale by E.L. Aaron & Co. 

Looking up this broker-dealer, I found a case: SEC v. Aaron regarding an appeal to a prior decision regarding a permanent injunction for violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. I don't think I will get much farther with this route, going to attempt contacting the transfer agent.

~

If anyone could help me discover if these companies are out of business, and conclude that my shares are worthless, it would be much appreciated. From what I can tell, Deep Sea Techniques was incorporated in the state of New York but Applied Management Sciences was incorporated in the state of Oregon.

**EDIT3:** Thanks /u/FinalDevice for having eyes.
>Note the names do not match here: ""Applied Management Sciences"" vs ""Applied Management Services"". It could be the same company and a type or a d.b.a. name, or it could be unrelated.


Confirmed through Fidelity and the transfer agent that Deep Sea Techniques, Inc. is dissolved. I'll hang on to the stock certificate and ask my father if he wants to keep it or see if a collector would buy it online.

As for Applied Management Sciences, Inc., the transfer agent listed on the stock certificate filed a notice of withdrawal as a transfer agent with the SEC, as well as their successor lol but I found the last link in the chain and will attempt to contact them tomorrow with the CUSIP. 

Appreciate everyone's help!"

You can search for company filings on the SEC site - https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Article/edgarguide.html  If something comes up, that's an indication they're a publicly traded company. 

This might be a good use for a reference librarian. Ask the reference desk at your local library if they can research these companies for you - you might pay a research fee, but it would give you a starting point.

Edit: I was interested in this and did a little searching. According to [this](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/investing/stocks/what-if-you-find-old-stock-certificate/), your brokerage may be able to help - and even if it's a private company now, the company might buy out your shares. According to [this](http://www.oldstocks.com/worth.htm) there are dedicated services to search for companies. According to [this](https://www.exhibitindexes.com/blog/mature-money-how-to-tell-if-old-stock-certificates-are-worth-anything/), even if the shares do not have value the stock certificates may be valuable to a collector."

The index has gained over 1500 points over the last year and I believe that we can continue to go up in the long term as well. Maybe not with this insane pace, but steadily.

2015 august was China currency devaluation and almost -20%

04/01/2021,stocks," They are pretty much exactly the same thing made by two different companies. VOO performs a bit better. It has a lower expense ratio (0.04% vs 0.09%) and it tracks the S&P 500 index a bit closer. 

SPY has more volume. If you're using a ton of leverage and are wealthy OR you're using a ton of leverage and trade outside cash hours, you want SPY.

VOO has a lower expense ratio and is thus preferable if you're just doing buy-and-hold or trade <$10M of it at a time during normal trading hours."

By simply reading dd in you know where, and finding intriguing info, on stocks that haven’t already blew up, or if so, at a value thats still not to far a head and can be justified if it’s a solid company and not just a bet. 

Weeding out the noise, the blatant pumps, for ones I’m comfortable holding. Worst case, you come across a solid company that doesn’t moon, like most of everything else. 

The average person fomoing into these positions probably are getting put down over time. But it can definitely be done."

My mom was asking about my investments, she's 58 and never touched the market, so I told her my ETFs and whatnot - then when searching online I found out there's a Vanguard international real estate fund.

I usually wait til the 1st, then throw the extra cash I had from last month into stonks. Now I have to wait til the 31st for VNQI lol"
04/01/2021,stocks,"VNQ is probably my favorite etf, particularly for the yield/steady growth so I’m definitely going to check out VNQI"
04/01/2021,stocks,"I like VNQ because real estate is always good to invest in, as a hedge against the market. 

I have VTI and VXUS against each other, I have BND and BNDX against each other. Now I can have VNQ and VNQI against each other. I have about 40/40/20% in stonks, real estate, bonds. So I think next month I'll just buy up VNQI to match VNQ cost-wise while maintaining my percentages.

THE BUDGET!"
04/01/2021,stocks,"I used to like the idea of investing in real estate as a separate category from the stock market.  But after looking more closely at their holdings, this type of fund is almost entirely invested in publicly traded real estate corporations, many of them large caps on the S&P 500.  A total market index fund is already including investment in most of these, and they're just another sector specific subset of the broader indexes.

I do think there could be some value in actually investing in real estate in some cases, which may perform differently from the stock market.  But investing in stocks that have to do with real estate is not quite the same thing as actually owning and developing land directly.

Looking at a graph of VNQ vs VTI, VNQ has dropped when VTI dropped, so it doesn't seem to be that great of a hedge.  The most notable difference is that VNQ has had much lower average returns.  Maybe that could turn around eventually, but if so VTI will include most of the same VNQ equities."
04/01/2021,stocks,"This is many trues and factually correct.

I have a personal belief that in the US, when COVID restrictions end, real estate will boom. There's currently a COVID relief plan where people can't be evicted from a lot of rented properties, or lose their mortgages, but when that plan ends a lot of people will lose their homes and a lot of those homes will go up for sale on the cheaps.

Is it ethical? Nah, not even a little. But I do believe there will come a time when the holdings of VNQ will rise faster than the total holdings of VTI. That's my bet.

If I didn't believe this, I would only have VTI/VXUS and BND/BNDX. But *maybe*, at some point, real estate will fire off while the rest of the market remains stable."

nobody knows. anyone who says they know is a liar or deluded. 

your core position should be a low fee fund or ETF that gives you broad exposure to the entire market or a slice of the market. options like FZILX/VTI, VOO, IWB, etc. 

single stocks are highly volatile, so there's an old rule to keep them to a minority of your investing world. they can be fun, but keep it in perspective."

jeez that's asking a lot for having no investment knowledge. You will probably not get that kind of return with ETF's. But you can still try.

\- Try to find an ETF with access to world market with low fees. You can also try to zoom in on 1 particular market but you will bare more risk. But since risk=reward it's an option. Depending on where you are located. For example: I live in Belgium. For me it's best to invest in an ETF that is domiciled in Ireland for tax reasons. It's also better to get an accumulating ETF since I pay taxes on dividends.

\- 40 a week might also not be your best bet. Time in the market beats timing in the market is the famous quote. Try to Google: ""Lump sum vs DCA"".

\- Also nobody can predict the market but it's the highest it's ever been so some caution may be in place if you are looking to enter at this point in time."

2021-04-01 18:54:11,stocks,"Stock Float Discrepancies Looking for some insight. How is it that multiple market sources can have wildly different stock float numbers? Here is a recent example.

**Savara** ($SVRA) 

Yahoo Finance/docoh - 28.02M 

Marketwatch/WSJ - 70.94M 

Finviz - 45.24M

I see a public offering last month, but the math and numbers still don't check. 

One conclusion I can draw is that Yahoo Finance appears to have a delay in when they receive or obtain this information. Is there a central database that these market sources gather company information from?  I'd rather go to that source, if it's more accurate."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Honestly, its best to check the most recent filing or the exchange website (if they publish the data publicly).  Unless there is active dilution, the last filing will provide an accurate number and depending on what data source the stock website is using, which data points they are using in their float calculation, and how often the database is updating."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Yeah this is a tricky one, as there is no definitive source for ""float"". We (I'm one of the people behind Docoh) currently use a third party (IEX) for our float data, which can definitely lag behind - like in this instance, as 28M is almost certainly not correct. We intend eventually to calculate float ourselves with actual sources to show where each part of the calculation comes from (e.g. oustanding stock comes from this filing, insider held shares comes from these filings, etc), to make it all more transparent.

Anyway, in this instance, the [latest prospectus](https://docoh.com/filing/1160308/0001193125-21-078515/SVRA-424B5#highlight=common%20stock%20to%20be%20outstanding) (mid March) shows around 111M shares outstanding after that offering. But I can't work out how WSJ gets to 71M float from that. The prospectus mentions [warrants to re-purchase 31M shares](https://docoh.com/filing/1160308/0001193125-21-078515/SVRA-424B5#highlight=Milestone%20Warrants), so that could account for a chunk of it – though I might be mis-interpreting that. I only see about [3M shares held by insiders](https://docoh.com/company/1160308/SVRA/insider-ownership-history).

There are about [43M held by institutions](https://docoh.com/company/1160308/SVRA/institutional-ownership-history) (look at the latest number under ""institutional ownership trends"" to get the latest for this month, which takes account of all the recent 13D and 13G action) - but most data providers (rightly) don't include institutional shares as part of the float calculation / subtraction, so it's probably not that.

I'll continue to investigate, but I suspect it's the higher numbers you see from the providers you listed (and we'll do better to improve ours, possibly by going to a different data provider for this metric)."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I use docoh quite frequently to get easy access to documents. Thanks for what you do!

If you want another example, checkout Canoo ($GOEV).

docoh 14.5M

Yahoo! 131.16M (3 weeks ago Yahoo! also had [14.5M float](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m33cyf/goev_gamma_squeeze_is_happening/gqms00e?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), which has since updated)

Finviz 88.95M

Marketwatch/WSJ 99.87M

This is all very interesting. I have personally never really taken interest in determining float and just assumed the market sources were relatively similar. For me, at least, this puts a magnified lens on how none of this appears to be transparent information. The other reddit poster suggested going directly to the exchange to locate the information which, unfortunately, does not exist."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Thats what they thought in 1987 too. AI calculated that it was impossible for the market to drop 20% and it still did, black monday. Obviously way different scenario but still.

Personally I dont believe the AI will be able to to this consistently, but who knows."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I feel like this get's into DC Universe territory, the pursuit of the Market Equation and Anti-Market equation. Remake the market in the AI's image."
04/01/2021,stocks,Sp500 and Nasdaq will also use AI to pick their stocks. Large cap index will just become more active and slightly more aggressive for picking stocks.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Maybe in a perfect world where everyone followed the rules, but we don't live in that world right?  Insider trading and market manipulation happens.  Unless the AI is able to bend the rules or outright cheat like humans can, it would never win in the long run."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Not a chance, AI will beat bots trading but people with augmented intelligence will always beat an AI without a driver"
04/01/2021,stocks,If AI did investing. All they would do is pump and dump stocks to beat the market IMO.
04/01/2021,stocks,"You remember when Microsoft trailed an AI to learn language?

People taught it to be a racist bigot within a day, I think.

There is space for AI, for technical trading. But replacing humans, well, not bloody likely."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Did you watch Westworld's last season? There is a example how an AI can predict the market. Realistically there is no way that an AI could has a high successful prediction about the market movements right now. An AI need real world information, digital Information and interpretation human emotions, there is no way that all government will let an AI has information of their citizens."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Current gen AI is trained on historical data in order to brute force correlations.

These types of AI will never be able to predict something that hasn't happened in the past.

So forget about predicting black swan events.

Real AI with understanding of causation is a lot farther away than you think."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I think we need to define what an AI is. Is an AI just a set of simple rules, that will buy the dip and sell the rise? Or can an AI predict the next year based on the current, available data?

The first AI, based on simple rules, was maybe classified as an AI years ago. Like your calculator was ""intelligent"", because it could calculate the log of any number without a lookup table! But the intelligence was not learned - it was given by the developer. You can take your best trader and condense their daily work into a set of rules that the AI will follow - you could sell it as an AI. But it will only work for the CURRENT market situation - it will fail when the market will change (like removing the gold standard).

So this AI is not an AI. It is a better Excel sheet. Lets make an AI. Machine Learning, Neuronal Networks, Deep Learning, all that good looking stuff. These are names for algorithm classes or process how to learn. They do not describe the intelligent part. They are steps how to learn pattern from data to predict an outcome. Feed a neuronal network with millions of letters and it will be used by the postal system to automatically read the address. The goal was to correctly identify the written letters and match them to digital letters. 

The main problem is the data. You need to have good, already categorized or classified (good / bad outcome of the input) data to feed a learning algorithm. We all know that the outcome of the future is not based on the past events. Yes, you can do this for a small window or for some cases. But the economy is very complex and there are always some random actors. A human is not a rational player - we are driven by emotions and instincts. The economy is per definition a chaotic system.

The more complex a system becomes, the more difficult it is for an AI to make a correct assumption. The whole economy at a given point in time as the input data? All measurable variable like the current currency flow, the stock markets, the crypto market, the resource market and every other market in general plus all the indicators that will drive the human to trade. Way to much. Google developed DeepGo to create an AI for the game Go. Go is too complex to calculate the perfect moves (like it is possible in chess!), so the AI learned to do some emotional moves based ""on intuition"". But the input space was very small. It is a board with a number of fields and each of them has the state 0 (no stone, 1 white and 2 black stone). Just the different indicators of a single stock can have more possible states than a single Go game. 

So all in all: Yes, you can make an ""AI"". This ""AI"" will be as intelligent as their makers and will generate a profit as long as their makers could make a profit if their would execute the trades as fast as computers. But you cannot throw machine learning on it. The data is too complex or the data is too dirty to be useful. The exploration space is way to big. So you have to create a compromise: Analyse only a small data set. But everything is connected. The price of bitcoins drops to zero -> Tesla's stock will drop. A small ship blocks the canal -> the oil prices are volatile."
04/01/2021,stocks,"No, [Soros' market reflexivity thesis](https://macro-ops.com/understanding-george-soross-theory-of-reflexivity-in-markets/) should prevent this. It's essentially the [observer effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics\)), but for markets."
04/01/2021,stocks,Yeah this has been a thing for ages. You think HFT firms are a bunch of people sitting at a computer button mashing as fast as possible?
04/01/2021,stocks,"It will never be able to predict the market. AI can do a lot, but the one thing is has never and likely will never be able to account for is human predictability. And what affects the market more than that?"
04/01/2021,stocks,AI could have predicted the covid pandemic the moment news came out back in early February that there was undetected community spread in Washington state.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Nope, the universe is a chaotic system.  It's not completely predictable, or even mostly predictable."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I haven't seen it mentioned yet... check out Numerai. It's a blockchain project, tokenized of course. The premise is a hedge fund that crowd sources signals and predictions from data scientists. But the data they're given is raw, so completely obfuscated. The goal being to find patterns or signals in the obscurity rather than typical financial information. The scientists are rewarded for correct and unique signals, and penalized for incorrect ones... giving incentive to act responsibly. This ultimately creates an AI that can act in markets."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I don't know that it would matter.  The prices only move because of unknown information becoming known.  If some supercomputer could accurately predict the market, then it would price in everything that will happen in the future and stock prices would never move again.

So I guess it would work once.

I'd be more worried about such powerful AI being able to manipulate the market rather than predict it."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I downloaded this app called “Stocks Alerter” that supposedly used AI to do swing trades and sends you notifications of when to get in and out. Unfortunately this is only if you pay for the full version and it’s too expensive for me to try, but the free alerts have been successful although they only send those once a week and don’t tell you exactly when to get out. Has anyone every tried this app out?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"No, there's no ""beating the market""

It's a ""living entity"".  That's why technical analysis is kind of cringe most of the time."
04/01/2021,stocks,robinhood is the market
04/01/2021,stocks,"So far I have worked (as a software engineer) for two investment firms implementing this type of machine learning models driven off thousands of related financial instrument's real time data, I must say they're quite accurate and also quite expensive to implement and maintain"
04/01/2021,stocks,"I think it all breaks down into some kind of pattern or patterns, it's much easier to predict the behavior of millions of people than it is to predict a handful."
04/01/2021,stocks,"This is the problem with any kind of technical trading.  Over the long term technical trades cannot win because the better a trade is the more quickly it gets crowded. 

AI would be a great economic analysis trader, but the problem there is the information it would need to get very good is hidden or protected.  Like, if an AI had access to every inventory flow of every company in the world it would be impossible to beat it stock trading.  Hell, it would be the best venture capitalist, and it would probably immediately start re-organizing society to be more efficient and better.

But the problem is that no one would ever share that level of information.  So, lacking that I think AI will be quite limited in its impact on stock trading for some time until humans start to trust it more."
04/01/2021,stocks,Good luck trying to get AI to predict the absolute nonsense that happened with GME
04/01/2021,stocks,"I know it's happening to some extent but I don't think there's an AI out there kicking the shit out of the market by a large enough margin that it's all that relevant yet. It would be huge news, no?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Not predict well in advance, but surely an AI that is given control over a trading company will have the ability to monitor more news, more current events, analyse speeches, more historical data and will be able to reach a conclusion and open a trading position more quickly than a human. It only needs to be a few seconds quicker to be able to have a massive advantage."
04/01/2021,stocks,"No, but AI CAN learn how the market reacts/has reacted to those kinds of situations and take positions after a period of time that will have the highest odds of profiting."
04/01/2021,stocks,"In a sense...yes.  An AI could predict market patterns based on what the blocking of the suez caused.  It could not predict the action, but it’s likely an AI could predict the reflective market pattern.  The problem is that Artificial intelligence doesn’t really exist today, but adaptive intuition does."
04/01/2021,stocks,"That's fair, those things are impossible to predict but there are always things that surge during a market crash which this hypothetical AI could identify or perhaps it could just very quickly identify when a large crash is imminent and buy heavy into a volatility index. I realize it's entirely possible that I have no clue what I'm talking about btw, just seems pretty interesting to me."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Not to get too science-fictiony but theoretically nothing is absolutely unpredictable.

If humans can hindsight the high wind, heavy-freight and narrow canal passageway, I don't see why a machine given all the data couldn't assign a risk to the canal being blocked.

If you deal with the amount institutions deal with, all you need to do is get a 10 minute warning from ""predictive logistics"" department along with a risk rating from the ""theoretical probability"" to outperform all your competitors and perhaps the market at large.

Yeh, sure if you mean a machine that can predict the path of every atom in the universe for the next 10-days....no. But you don't need this much to beat everybody."
04/01/2021,stocks,I mean an ai could be the first to see the news about the Suez canal blockage and the first to react to it
04/01/2021,stocks,"YES

Amazing stuff. Look up youtube videos of the guy. He does caution that they can't be too big. Or else they'd move the market in ways that would hurt or ruin their own trades and, well, market. 

HFTs came after all this stuff and run on AI, I'd assume. In some form. ""Flash Boys"" book."
04/01/2021,stocks,I wonder if the deviation was the result of changes in HFT algorithms/federal rules/etc
04/01/2021,stocks,I would love to know more about this. Do you have a link or any more details?
04/01/2021,stocks,"Definitely. Thats what HFT trading is all about -- and ML is being used increasingly for various parts of it. There is exploitable information in order routing and flows, so now you know why payment for order flow is all the rage with brokers and market makers."
04/01/2021,stocks,Most trading done is algo trading. It makes up ~80% daily volume.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Institutional algos can see the limit order book (even when orders are hidden, they can ping them). So they know in advance where everyone placed their limit orders. Think about those cases when your order failed to execute by exactly one cent, the algos take the price very close to your limit and back but it never goes through. There's no way for a retail investor to beat an institutional algo at this kind of stuff."

04/01/2021,stocks,"The human brain could be described as a general AI already. For some reason it is difficult to win because all the people you are competing with have the same hardware. The same thing will happen to whatever tool we develop to predict markets. If you used deep learning in markets before it was developed, you would kick everyone’s ass. Now, not so much."
04/01/2021,stocks,"that's essentially neural nets. You feed it millions/billions of data points and it will ""learn"" the behavior based on that.

04/01/2021,stocks,The AI will just take the info en mass without hesitation. It would control the world in a matter of months then about a year or two later us humans will realize what happened but it’ll be too late.

04/01/2021,stocks,"Yes, but AI will still be dealing with humans who are capable of doing some wildly stupid $hit.

How do you think AI would deal with the Gee Emm Eee saga?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Yeah but that AI only will have information about people living in China, even China's stock market is heavily influenced by thing that happens outside of China, US would not give that kind of information for an AI that doesn't been created by them or vice versa."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Saying ""I'm building a convolutional neural network"" sounds a lot cooler than saying ""my computer is doing a bunch of linear algebra for me"" so can you really blame people?"

04/01/2021,stocks,"Sure, until the the expected does not happen."
04/01/2021,stocks,Well I'm working on an ai that scrapes reddit and analyzes sentiment so it could very likely pick up on that stock.
04/01/2021,stocks,"I feel like the AI would potentially have a huge amount of success with that stock. Most of retail involved is reading long-winded DD without truly understanding it and having faith to buy. That AI could process all that info and have a much more informed idea of true float, etc. It could also probably day trade these past weeks to just massive success if it had a better grasp on what was holding the price to the $40ish swing range it's held to.

I don't know enough to say. But also, it's possible it would just stay away from that stock and have more success with normal market movements. The AI doesn't need it's hands in everything to succeed, it just needs reliably above the average success."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Agreed. The dystopian view is that we'll have AI's competing with each other between institutions at various levels, including between nations. I am sure that you heard that discussion as well."
2021-04-01 17:55:07,stocks,"I tried to predict the stock market every day in March. Here's how it went - and what I learned. Every single day this month, I tried to do the one thing that everybody says you shouldn't try to do. I tried predict the exact daily movements of the stock market -- specifically, the daily direction, high, and low of the NASDAQ -- and posted my best guess in the daily discussion forum.

I had to pay incredibly close attention to the stock market every day to do it. Every single morning, I did technical and market analysis to try to keep from publicly embarrassing myself. I learned more about the stock market this month than I have in my entire time trading.

To celebrate one month of predictions, I wanted to take a look back at the month of March and share some of the things I've learned.

Here's the first one:

**I can't predict the stock market.**

*Damn it.* I really thought I'd be able to do it.

You can see my [full scorecard here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/MkMAC), but it isn't really anything to brag about. Here's how I did:

* **Direction:** 65% correct
* **Daily high:** Median error of 0.26%
* **Daily low:** Median error of 0.36%

I was always more interested in the highs and lows than the direction, but *damn* is 65% ever a bad score. I've looked into it -- if I'd just predicted whatever the premarket said, I would've been right 74% of the time.

Part of the problem was this:

**When J. Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**

When J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.

I wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month

[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)

J. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.

**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**

I've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: ""Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?""

One thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.

AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.

I saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: ""Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?"" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. 

**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**

One of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the ""bond yield"". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.

It never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.

I'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:

* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March
* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.
* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.
* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech

**... but sometimes it is.**

That doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.

Another huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.

This story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.

People really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.

**I still think the stock market can be predicted**

When I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.

They probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.

Everything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.

If you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.

[You can see today's prediction here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/kHRAC)"
04/01/2021,stocks,"The variation of the prices of AAPL MSFT GOOG and AMZN are not explained by the movement of the nasdaq. It’s the other way around. Those 4 companies alone make up 35.73% of the index so any way they move will also move the index. 

I will admit I haven’t done enough research to back this up but it seems extremely unlikely bind yields are not statistically significant to stock prices. Companies that have low or negative profits where we are betting on future growth go down a lot due to rising rates because their future cash flows have a higher discount rate. This is why the ARK ETFs got slammed, they are mostly speculative companies."
04/01/2021,stocks,Really cool thanks for sharing. So a big take away was the value to tech transition of cash and performance. Any more particulars there?
04/01/2021,stocks,I mean if you're consistently 65% correct (big if) you could make a lot of money.
04/01/2021,stocks,"I love the detail in this analysis. 

If you haven’t yet read it, you might like Nate Silver’s book called The Signal and the Noise. He has an entire chapter on predicting the market, and other chapters on gambling probabilities, predicting weather, earthquakes, elections, etc. I think it would be right up your alley."
04/01/2021,stocks,Thanks! Have been wondering if I could do the same. Would be interesting to test your predictions vs some prediction software. Always been fascinated with predicting the market.
04/01/2021,stocks,So do we know ahead of time when J. Powell speaks? Or are these last-minute press conferences usually?
04/01/2021,stocks,"The fact that a user called /u/wsb_shitposting would come up with something that's not only not-meme but actually took a whole month of work is confusing and scary.

*The guy studied nasdaq so that we wouldn't suspect he's really a spy.*

Thanks for the results and the link, ma dude. May your calls always go long and your enemies tremble short."
04/01/2021,stocks,I look forward to your prediction every morning and then the recap at the end of trading day to see how far off you were.
04/01/2021,stocks,Did you notice any correlation around Stimulus Checks? Whether it be the talks or the actual timing of the checks being sent?
04/01/2021,stocks,Knowing why you are right/wrong after something happens just means that your brain is making up a convincing explanation.
04/01/2021,stocks,"This was awesome to read. I like this comment "" **The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.** "". I've been noticing that on the non-volatile stocks out there, nice to see there's others out there confirming there is some truth to this."
04/01/2021,stocks,"You picked a pretty bizarre month to  read it. Why not try it again when there isnt such craziness blowing up. - Obviously  we didnt  know it would be weird.

You should do it a few more times and compare what a normal month is. I bet you would find your % is a bit higher."
04/01/2021,stocks,What tools did you use? NN or basic statistics libraries? I'm not familiar with Google datastudio. How did you do sentiment analysis?
04/01/2021,stocks,"1) This is why many people sit out on Fed days trading. Fed reports can move markets hundreds of points up or down in seconds and then even whipsaw you the other direction. Good time to stand on the sidelines if your trading or at least keep tight stops.

2) The RATE OF CHANGE is what is important on the 10 year yield.  It was the fact that the 10 year shot up to 1.5% and beyond quicker than expected that had investors spooked. It implies that the Fed would be forced into yield curve control or raising rates sooner than expected as the economy is heating up. 

3) You really should only pay attention to the futures IMO. The cash index is sort of irrelevant IMO. Major gaps get filled and reversals happen in the futures markets all the time. 

4) At the end of the day, the only two things that really matter are interest rates and earnings IMO."
04/01/2021,stocks,"A 65% chance of being right really isn’t too bad. 

Make every trade a 1% trade or the likes, and you’ll be coming out a head 6-7/10 times. I don’t think it would take you from rag to riches but being right more than 50% of the time really isn’t so bad. 

I would agree that I think it could be predicted some extent. In my case I think I could predict the longer term easier, I don’t have the tools to really analyze short term sentiment that can 180 on a tweet and be as volatile as a crackheads heart beat."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Saying ""65% is a bad score"" is wrong.  And no offense, but you saying that kind of means you're not understanding the statistics and nature of this assessment.  

If someone could consistently achieve 65% correctness they could be incredibly wealthy.  

It means that for every 3 investment opportunities, 2 would cancel each other out, and 1 would be free and clear success.  If you used static position sizes that were opened and closed consistent to the success rate, you could be absurdly wealthy."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I love reading your predictions and then seeing if you are right haha, hope you keep it up. Managing to predict the nasdaq breakout was my height of q1. I could see the rotation back starting to happend. The stock market is such a complex puzzle, its very fascinating. Edit:Thx for the gold!"
04/01/2021,stocks,">I still think the stock market can be predicted

well, there's strong data showing certain TRENDS in the market. e.g., the January effect where small company stocks tend to do really well early in the year. these trends happen more often than not, but are not a guarantee. 

but don't confuse a short-term pops with long-term trends. the market is so big and complex that it's difficult to prove correlation. how do we know for certain that Politician X's speech has any direct influence on millions of professional and amateur investors? we can't run a control experiment, and show how the market would react if Biden made the speech a day or a week later. what about the European or Japanese markets on the same day?"
04/01/2021,stocks,Cool post bro! Hope your predictions get more and more accurate all the best
04/01/2021,stocks,"When the big boys take profits , they don’t screw around.  Imo It’s one of the reason they live the 50, 100, and 200 day averages, because when they buy in they want to hold most of it a while and then dump a bit load , driving prices back down , triggering panic in the small investor who sees their life savings evaporating , so they sell about at the 100-200 day and then the big boys buy in again, laughing all the way to the bank."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Is NASDAQ a predictor or simply reflective?  If a predictor - how much lead time?  Having the same graph shape makes perfect sense.  Having the the same graph shape and  ahead by 2 minutes (or any computable/actionable length of time) would be the holy grail of investing.

If you think about stocks as an ocean (an ocean of stocks) then indexes are are big ocean waves and individual stocks are minor waves on top of that.  So of course when the market goes down (the big ocean waves drop) then everything riding on top will go down with it (and vice versa).  


Here's an interesting thought experiment. Take your ARKK example and chart it along with QQQ, QLD (2x QQQ), and TQQQ (3xQQQ) over a course of 1mo, YTD, 6mo, 1 year, 2year...and you will find that it mimics these charts - falling between TQQQ and QLD.  So why is this?  Because for the most part ARKK is tech oriented in the same way that the NASDAQ is (QQQ is the Nasdaq index ETF) .  Tech focused stocks that aren't on the Nasdaq tend to match the Nasdaq wave regardless of where it's listed (NYSE, etc) verses the index of the listing market because it's the tech sentiment that matters.  Having said this, QQQ is not a predictor of ARKK (or vice-versa), it's just a consequence of being made up of the same types of stocks.  


This is why Apple, Amazon, MS, Google, etc match the QQQ - because they are part of the QQQ (and weighted pretty heavily at that).  One doesn't predict the other - they simply behave in unison until there is some news or performance indicator that suggest that one should be treated differently.

Let me know when you have proof a true leading/trailing indicator - I'll be happy to try it with real money."
04/01/2021,stocks,This is all very amazing and blows my mind. Do you think the rotation back to tech is going to last a while or is it over as of now? Do you ever plan to predict more than 1 day ahead?

I can tell you, there is nothing more difficult than predicting the market precisely day after day, in the short term is basically random (no significant autocorrelation still at lag 20).

04/01/2021,stocks,There's a little bit of a causality issue here. You say that Apple follows the market. But Apple is a big component in the index that you're using to represent the market. So the market is following Apple. traders of the big stocks look at each other and follow what each other is doing. They look at the indices and they follow what the indices are doing. But the only way they can affect the market is by trading the stocks. And one of the stocks they trade is Apple. Which feeds right back into it.

04/01/2021,stocks,"Top Post, very interesting.

I have been running a similar-but-less-involved experiment myself this month and have at least some of the same conclusions. Applying nowhere near the level of diligence and research that you have here with regard to technical and market analysis, I've seen:

On a day-to-day profit basis, lately the premarket rises and the first 20 mins are often a good proportion of the rise for the day, so I'd ended up figuring as you did in that regard.

After-market changes are sometimes significant as well, so moving to a broker that allows you to trade after hours is on my to-do list.

There's been a few interesting events this month: Policy change on what is considered capital reserves that caused the Dow to dunk at close yesterday, I guess logic should have predicted that. Plus a hedge fund implosion that caused a rippled firesale of of solid companies' stocks as postitions were liquidated at CS and GS, leaving undervalued stock opportunities out there. It's likely that won't be the last of those we've seen.

Government policy and indicative spending do get baked in early once 'properly announced' even if it's not a surprise up to that point, so you can ride that wave. 

It seems easier to predict a basket of stocks that have a cycle that 'feels' less inter-dependent on the market as a whole than it is to predict the whole stock market, but you've still gotta watch what everything else is doing. It's easier often to get to know the cycle of specific stocks to know what their daily and news reaction patterns are, so you can dive in for a few percent here and there.

I have zero time applied here in working out whether rotation is over, so it's interesting that you're seeing indicators that it largely is, announcements aside.

For me with my minimal effort: In summary: Some of this does actually feel predict-able, though I've gotten it wrong a couple of times and let a loss run too long, sure I'm right before bailing...a bad sign but a good learning opportunity.

But I don't know what you or other here think: It's starting to feel again like it's the unknown-unknowns that will get you. So, unless you knew that CS and Goldmans (and Deutsche it seems also now) had massive exposure to Archeos Capital, and that Archeos was stacked to the roof with leveraged CFD's ready to blow, you couldn't know there'd be bargains to be had following the implosion, or losses to be had if you were holding the same stock. For sure some of that you could find out with research, but some of that was clearly a surprise for all involved. 

For me at least, being ready to pick up some of that at knockdown prices when these things happen has been a mindset change, just keeping an eye out and having that plan.

As an aside, at least for much of March, movement in and out of Bitcoin feels like it's becoming more predictable in it's cycles, and for now limits and support don't seem to have been be changing. 

As ever, all this will remain exactly as it is, until it isn't   :)"

Hell, he said the word taper last time, and he had to, otherwise folks would have continued to lose trust in what he says as he continued to dodge the obvious reality that so many factors are pushing toward inflation.  That's because right now the big central bank is being loose with money.  They've been so loose that the s&p broke 4k.  The illusion can only last so long, we've more currency and less everything else.  Sooner or later the central bank is going to want a cut; they want to fix their balance sheets and start climbing out of all this debt.  The day that happens you're going to see people take profits and play defensive with their money and leverage.

04/01/2021,stocks,"I found your comment that everything is not priced in interesting. Obviously there is always a delay between news/events and share price, but eventually, and within a pretty short time-frame (as in your example), things almost always get priced in... sometimes it just take a minute (or...100) for everyone to make their moves. I 100% agree that you can get ahead of it (i.e. be one of the first to buy into a stock when they announce good news)... BUT I also think that also takes a significant amount of time, effort, and quick-wittedness to do this with a notable level of consistency. In fact, I would think there are probably some people who have software that analyzes news articles and immediately makes buys/sells based on sentiment analysis. There is an ETF ($AIEQ) which uses AI to determine when a stock us under/over valued and makes buys based on that algo... but it would be an interesting strategy to do the same with news articles instead of balance sheets. However, as is typically true with most strategies - if the strategy is successful, it won't be successful for long because someone else will copy it. EMH.

Also, I argue that what's priced in is not events/facts, but rather the **risk/odds of those facts/events occurring**. So for example, when a bill, say to outlaw gas cars, is introduced in the Senate and the market thinks it will have a 50% chance of passing, TSLA will not move, but when the first senator votes ""yes"", the price should become Previous\_Value\*Expected\_EV\_Revenue\_Increase\*(1/100) because there are 100 senators and now there is 1 yes vote vs 99 unknown votes.... Many times when things like this happen, stocks continue to go up for several hours or even days... but at t=0 **there is still risk.** If a $10 stock goes to $15 on good news, and then slowly continues upward to $18 on that same news, there is still risk that the stock is overhyped... the market is continuously evaluating this fact. When the stock hits $18, it could just as easily fall back to $15 when a large investor realizes the stock is overvalued - and then smaller investors may decide that because the big investor sold, there is now more perceived **risk of a retail-led sell-off** and so it would be rational to sell at $15, even though they bought at $16 two hours ago. The reason why it took so long to increase from $15 to $18 was because as the price increased, the market was saying there is an increasing chance of a reversal - which is intensified when a large investor closes a large position and therefore is at risk of initiating a large reversal.   


TL;DR risk is everywhere and in all things."
04/01/2021,stocks,Will you do it again to see if your predictions become more accurate?
04/01/2021,stocks,I did this in March 2020 much more volatility is way more fun I gambled with about 30k I walked away with 140k by November before election.
04/01/2021,stocks,"The largest component of the nasdaq is extremely large tech companies. When tech falls a bit all of the tech companies to fall a bit which causes the the Nasdaq to fall. So the thesis is right but i think you need to adjust what you take away from it being those 5 companies(fb goog msft amzn aapl) are all in the same sector and face similair if not the same obstacles that pop up. And those 5 companies move most of the nasdaq unless there is a sector shift away from tech. 

A further theory i have on that is everyone knows how much money 1990-2000s investors made on tech because we all use that tech. So theyd like to invest but its almost always near all time highs so theyre afraid to do it. But when the market rotates and tech falls you not only have people already in the market saying hey thats the best price on aapp ive seen in 6 months im gonna buy that, you also get brand new investors get to see oh the max price is far enough away from where its at now that even if there is no growth i should be positive eventually. Then tech recovers from that rotation more quickly then say mining/food will recover after it is eventually rotated out of. Thats why the nasdaq just keeps moving up big picture. 

Id love to hear thoughts on this theory i have. Ive recently dove into the financial world and admittedly have never followed the narket as close as i am now so maybe this isnt a long term pattern and would greatly appreciate insight into why im wrong or right."

04/01/2021,stocks,"- Most of the rotation happened in the first week of March, but people rotated again whenever Powell spoke.
- Speculative stocks (basically anything in ARKK) dropped harder than big tech. After that first week of March, big tech more or less followed the Dow Jones index (as long as Powell wasn't talking). But stocks like TSLA and SQ just kept dropping.
- The rotation seems to be over. Based on a technical analysis I previously [shared here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mgc21y/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_mar/gsspe9m/?context=3), it looks to me like, after we hit the bottom on March 8th, the NASDAQ went through a consolidation phase where it was trying to decide which was to go. The stock prices all fit into this nice snug triangle. That triangle ran out of space on Tuesday and, on Wednesday, we fully broke out.
- TSLA and SQ seem to be fine now, too."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Haven't read the book so I don't know what his conclusions are, but imho predicting anything is quite possible. The main issue is complexity of systems and how to identify relevant variables, but also recognize a change in relevance of certain variables over time. For a human, even with current technology, that's just a really ardous task because you need to pay attention to so many things at the same time. This is why most predictions are either broad or limited in their scope.

For example, you can predict developments and inherent effects within an industry with ok-ish accuracy if circumstances don't change too much and the overall system remains stable. But as soon as unexpected events start to influence e.g. the supply chain, it's difficult to tell if or how or when it will affect certain companies.

Some changes might seem irrelevant because they do not seem to impact an industry for now, but may have an accumulative effect x years later down the line, usually socio-economic/political stuff that tends to manifest slowly.

I think predictions will get much more precise with advances in A.I. because that will make it way easier to assess both short-term and long-term relevance of fluctuations and also allow to simulate potential outcomes based on historic data.

A.I. can also keep track of many more variables and take into account human nature much more reliably, something we have a difficult time understanding on any scale. Predicting how irrational behaviour may impact certain developments should be fairly simpl for A.I. with proper models.

On the one hand I'm super excited about these future possibilities, but it's also scary to imagine that our species might have to fully rely on A.I. and basically just execute suggestions or commands that we can't fully understand or haven't really investigated ourselves to comprehend the underlying parameters. We'll have to learn to blindly trust A.I. decision making at some point."

04/01/2021,stocks,"My phone died and my reply is gone so I got the short version for you:

the NASDAQ should be a good predictor of price movements. The underlying idea of a valuation based on CAPM or dividend discount model. 
To determine the return of equity we use the beta factor which tells us the correlation of the company stock and the wider stock market. 

Two thoughts on that. Every news for the market (tax cuts, pandemic etc.) is effecting the stock market and the single stock in the same direction. 
The NASDAQ is a smaller index with constitutes which are peers too each other in one way or the other. A peer is used to determine a multiple or a beta factor (see above)

On quick thing on the reaction of bonds and stocks. A rise in interest rates is correlated with lower returns of the stock market and not negative returns. E.g. interest rate goes up from 1.5% to 2.0% the return of the stock market goes down from 8.2% to 7.9% for instance. 
Moreover, in accordance to the EMH (efficient market hypothesis) all information is reflected in the stock price. Though the broader public might not know of Powell’s ideas upfront it is definitely reflected in the stock market before hand. Which means you should look at a 2-3 day window around the announcements and check for abnormal returns in comparison to the history. This is how you can check if a rise in yields causes negative abnormal returns in the stock market."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I have found that to be the case.  When the s&p goes up or Vti goes up most stocks go up.  And  vice versa.

04/01/2021,stocks,"Here's a thought on that:

Apple makes up \~11% of the NASDAQ by weight. So all else equal, a 1% move in Apple should cause a NASDAQ move of 0.11%.

If you see that they are correlated closer to 1:1 than to the weight 1:0.11 (so, a 1% move in the NASDAQ = a 1% move in the same direction in Apple), then that implies something more along the lines of what TrueFireOSP is saying - that this stock is mostly changing in step with the NASDAQ, or somehow driving sentiment for the whole NASDAQ .

I think the former is more likely than the latter, especially since it's estimated that 25-50% (maybe more) of the stock market is not individual stock holdings, but ETFs and mutual funds that track things like the NASDAQ."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Etfs and indexes hold almost half the stock market.

They used to track the stocks, now the stocks track them.

Michael Burry thinks there is a huge passive investing bubble where indexes prop up shitty companies because those companies track the index.

Idk if I believe that, results still matter, especially around earnings. But as the % of total investments in passive indexes and etfs rises, so too does the correlation.

In my case, on that day, when I saw that the NASDAQ had hit my high at open and seemed like it was going to drop, I bought a put on QQQ. Then I just waited until it hit the bottom line and sold it for a significant profit.

I keep a small amount of money aside for these types of trades and put the profits into an index fund. The day trading provides revenue and the index fund is actual investing.

04/01/2021,stocks,It is an identical but a large portion of what happens in those stocks is similar to what's going on in the indices. Probably 70% of the motion The rest is going to be noise or people discovering old company news. The only real deviation is when the company does something big.
04/01/2021,stocks,"> How does an ETF being shorted impact the stock price? 

If the ETF drops, there will be an arbitrage opportunity between that and the component stocks. This will quickly be closed, maintaining their equivalence.

Supposedly the big NQ rally last friday was the fund that blew up closing their hedge (short NQ/ES). So that would be a case where futures rising will cause a rally in the component stocks.

Most of the time I think it works the other way around though - stocks lead, the index follows. And the charts only end up the same as arb opportunities get eaten away at quickly."

04/01/2021,stocks,"This is basically why ETFs while holding a decent chunk of the overall market don't actually effect price discovery.

To understand why you need to understand how ETFs work.
When you buy and sell and ETF it doesn't immediately buy and sell shares in the underlying companies. This wouldn't be efficient.
Instead what you are trading are ETF ""units"" which correspond to fractional shares in the underlying.

Special market participants called Authorized Participants (basically huge banks) are granted the ability by the ETF to create and redeem units for the underlying.

As such ETFs only lead to purchases or sales when there are flows in or out of the ETF causing units to be created or redeemed.

The price of the ETF units is simply calculated by using the Net Asset Value of the underlying securities so the ETF doesn't need to be actively traded for price discovery of the ETF units themselves, NAV does a good enough job of this and funds will take care of making sure the price stays consistent by exploiting any differences and arbitraging, which also provides liquidity.

TLDR: ETFs don't destroy price discovery because they don't actively trade in the underlying except on flows. Active trading still accounts for 99% of the actual volume."

The number of Americans retiring daily has nearly doubled since the year 2000. Currently, roughly 10,000 people turn 65 each day.

There is about a 50% chance that the market will go *down* after opening if the premarket is green.

He said there is 74% chance the market closes green, given the premarket was green. And he said there’s a 50% chance the market will open in the red given the premarket was green. The probability you described is the probability of closing green, given that premarket was green **and that the market opened red**.

The fact that we know the market opens red is an additional known,  information you ignore by still using the 74% number from back before we knew the market would open red; it’s combined probability for both opening green (we don’t want to buy) or red (a profitable buy opportunity).

Using your strategy, you’d end up profiting on (likely far) less than 74% of attempts, because a (likely large) fraction of that 74% are days with a green premarket, green open, and green close.

To know if we’d be profitable in this strategy, we need the probability of all-green day, so please don’t try this."

Solid chance you land some amount of profit if close > open according to the 74%?  the better less dumb move would be to hop out when you hit a good gain (if you do) and not wait for close.  Instead closing>open would hopefully be your save if you never hit your target.

2021-04-01 17:52:33,stocks,"My take on why $WISH is a great buy right now  Regardless of your opinion on Wish's products, shipping times etc., $15-16 (ticker price right now) for an ecommerce marketplace consistently in the top 10 in the app store + with billions in revenue is a steal. Wish is a baby, and if it follows the trajectory of marketplaces like Aliexpress, Amazon etc., people are gonna look back on this price like it was a joke.

I'm also saying this as a merchant on the Wish marketplace making a substantial amount of money - they're making **BIG** changes to try and improve delivery times + quality assurance. For example, they recently launched 2 programs:

1. **Wish Express** (like amazon prime)
2. **Warehouses** \- they are building warehouses in China to collect orders and ship them out first class to international customers. They're focusing HEAVILY on the US, but they also have a huge amount of buyers from low income areas like Brazil, Chile, Lithuania etc.
3. They're pushing merchants to meet a **15 day shipping time** (and they're doing it via fines if you don't meet that threshold). This addresses one of the biggest complaints about Wish for US customers - slow shipping b/c most merchants are selling / dropshipping from China. Although other countries (brazil, chile etc.) don't complain about longer shipping times because they haven't been exposed to Amazon Prime like the West, this improves experience for US customers.

They've also gone on an engineering spree, revamping everything about the merchant backend. 

Even though they've gone down since IPO, I still think this is a great bet (I mainly say this as a seller). I put in a bunch in there and I expect it to go up. Either through growth or if they get acquired by a larger company (e.g. Amazon)."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I like wish a lot and have been accumulating lately. Does over $2 billion in sales! I ""wish"" us luck. Lol."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I honestly had assumed Wish was part of AliExpress or a Chinese competitor.  I buy products from both AliExpress and Amazon somewhat occasionally.  They are not at all comparable.  

I understand that Wish focuses on the Americas and Europe moreso than AliEx (Russia excluded). 

FYI Chile is the richest and most developed South American country.  Lithuania isn’t poor either, really.  I’m familiar with Chile and it would be dumb to underestimate their spending power."
04/01/2021,stocks,Is this done dropping?
04/01/2021,stocks,">I honestly had assumed Wish was part of AliExpress or a Chinese competitor.

To my understanding Wish buys from Alibaba or AliExpress and drop ships to the end customer, so your assumption was almost right"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Definitely not comparable to amazon in terms of products, but that’s mainly bc it’s mostly straight dropshipping from China. Amazon has vendors that make their own products as well as companies that use it as an additional selling channel.

In terms of Chile, I definitely believe you. I’m pretty shocked at the volume of orders I get from Chile as well as Brazil. European countries are big spenders on Wish. Japan also buys quite a bit.

Either way, Wish has a long way to go, but the huge changes that I’ve personally seen take place in the past few months + how fast they’re making those changes to become more dominant gives me confidence that it’ll be a good stock.

And also, based on the lockdowns going on, I’m willing to bet on any ecommerce company, especially b/c ecommerce is still in its infancy despite how huge it looks."

High volatility across the market is generally a bad thing since most  investors will end up with mismanaged risk portfolios because on Monday they had a great risk profile and by Friday the volatility has pushed them into a higher risk portfolio they were not intending to buy into, and this can cause a higher risk of people losing your life savings in bad trades."

Now that on-prem is largely going away in favor of the cloud, the business model is dying.  The cloud providers are basically mooching off open source.  They install it, sell it to clients, profit from it, but they have their own employees provide support.  They have taken over the source of revenue the open source companies had.

It was an acknowledgement their business model was not working and it threatened the future of the company.

It seems to me this is an uphill battle because cloud providers are incentivized to provide a service that is functionally equivalent to MongoDB but avoids the fees.  It might work out.  I don't know.  The company can certainly get revenue from small cloud providers.  The large cloud providers seem to be quite adept at making their own databases to differentiate themselves from other large providers.

Their real problem was that they (at this point) almost certainly lied about how serious their preorders were.

I would be less concerned about how the truck looks and more concerned about whether or not there is actually demand for a Lordstown vehicle in general, given a lot of their orders aren't serious. I expect Lordstown to be another Nikola. My only question to you is if you're interested in the EV space why not look at real companies like Lucid or Nio, or any other EV company that isn't a fraud.

From your video, Workhorse had put a lot of R&D into the pick up before they spun it off.  Are you counting all that time in your ""young company"" time frame.  And working product?  Last fall they had their alpha up and running in test mode.  Now they are in beta mode (with the first two off the line this week).  If those pass the tests, they will be ready to be up and running.  That's the advantage of how they came into being.  Most of the work was done, just had to finish it up.

> Hinderburg shorting Lordstown. 

In doing so it's in their (Hinderburg) best interest to make Lordstown look as bad as possible.  Little bit of a conflict don't ya think?

> lordstown have no validation for it's batteries, and seems at best months from actual mass production. 

If they had been a ""true"" start up, they would not be rolling beta's off the line right now.  Optimistic on the company to say end of the year they will start production.  But it could happen.

>The vehicle doesn't seem to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards

>(FMVSS) testing required by the NHTSA.

That's what happens when you go with a completely different model type and have to make new parts and designs to fit it.  That being the HUB motor model.  There isn't a production vehicle anyplace with the hub motor design.  So of course it's not going to meet any motor vehicle safety standards.  No motor at all in the center of the vehicle.  No drive train.  So now they have to show that without those components, the vehicle will be safe in crashes.  Not sure if there are any production vehicles on the market right now with the ""skateboard"" platform they have.  So of course they are going to have to prove it's safety.  Thinking outside the box (Personally I LOVE the idea of hub motor EV's) will have to prove they are safe."

rural Alaska was to illustrate the point. I also mentioned how Utah, moderately cold, can destroy standard batteries in winter. most of the nation faces stretches of sub-zero weather from time to time, and the current data is that EV batteries simply aren't too reliable under these conditions. 

EVs will face similar problems in high-population places like Chicago, which gets extremely cold for much of the year. 

or the millions of trucks that work at least part of the year in extreme cold weather while hauling large loads or needing high levels of engine power. I'm just skeptical of the utopian predictions of the EV business. it's all a little cult-like."

This truck is designed for people who don't use trucks for their purpose.

A pick-up looks almost exactly the same as it did 20, even 50 years ago, because the use hasn't changed."
2021-04-01 14:02:43,stocks,"Nio Report Big Gains In First-quarter Deliveries Nio sprang in a surprise for its investors on April Fools' day by reporting deliveries that exceeded the tempered forecast the EV maker issued last week.

Nio delivered 7,257 cars for the month of March, the Chinese EV start-up said in a statement released Thursday. This represented a record monthly total and a 373% increase year-over-year.

The break-up of the monthly total is as follows: 1,529 ES8s, 3,152 ES6s, both of which are all-electric SUVs, and 2,576 EC6 premium smart electric coupe SUVs.

The quarterly number was at a record 20,060 vehicles, up 423% from the first quarter of 2020.

Nio has outperformed its domestic rival XPeng Inc. (NYSE: XPEV), which reported earlier Thursday monthly deliveries that could not beat its January total.

04/01/2021,stocks,"5 days ago: Stock delisted, CCP, China hustle

Today: aww man I wish I could bought more when it dipped"
04/01/2021,stocks,"more than 5% premarket now 

who is in with me after opening hours   ?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Anyone bought at $60 above, are you guys still holding?"
04/01/2021,stocks,Thought I was going to be waiting forever to be green on NIO!
04/01/2021,stocks,It is still trading for a pretty ridiculous sales multiple - there are much better risk/reward plays out there. If anything slows their growth even a little bit in the next 10 years the stock would probably get crushed. I don't see the chip shortage letting up much in the next year either.
04/01/2021,stocks,We are in the beginning of a 10 yr EV bull run. Don’t expect to go straight up. Every now and then we will dip and get rid of weak hands and provide opportunity for new investors to enter at discount. Those who hold will get rewarded!
04/01/2021,stocks,"EVs remain the future, and were massively oversold during the correction. Nio will soon snap back to its old support of $45, and then push back into the $50s as the spring/summer progresses."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Just made $400 off puts.
Can’t stay down so long then turn it around with a 6% gain"
04/01/2021,stocks,Got in at 21.70$ up like 30%
04/01/2021,stocks,"Yesterday there were reports they halted production because of chip shortages.  Today this.  I don't know, as a NIO bag holder, I'm not feeling too confident.  Chinese stocks are just such unknowns."
04/01/2021,stocks,This might trick some 18-24 year olds who think EVs are poggers into buying. I still think public transport is the future and not expensive electric vehicles
04/01/2021,stocks,">Nio has outperformed its domestic rival XPeng Inc. (NYSE: XPEV), which reported earlier Thursday monthly deliveries that could not beat its January total.

Meanwhile, SAIC - which is not US listed - delivered over 100,000 EVs in Q1 (a few thousand of which were in developed markets in Europe and Australasia) and had 600% year-on-year growth. 

Nio looks solid when you only compare it to XPeng and Li. But once you start comparing it to established Chinese OEMs who aren't US listed, it looks a shakier. 

With the valuations and the way these companies are talked about, you'd expect Nio to be leading the legacy OEMs in sales and sales growth. But the reality is Nio is trailing in both metrics which is a concern given they have market domination priced in."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Reminder to take what this sub thinks with a bowl full of salt. Just wait until BB gets some good news in a few weeks, same thing will happen."
04/01/2021,stocks,glad i doubled down last week

04/01/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/01/2021,stocks,Long since 2018 here. Avg cost $4.69. Haven't sold any and am not planning to for a while
04/01/2021,stocks,Bought 2 days ago for around 35. Hoping it was a good call to dca
04/01/2021,stocks,Sold yesterday to consolidate into tech ETFs instead of individual stocks so I take full credit for this one.
04/01/2021,stocks,59 was my buy point ___have come close to cutting my losses but do still expect eventual 80 but 50 first.  Afraid it will rally if I sell.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Kinda the name of the game with EVs though, right now they aren't very widespread but pretty much every country in the world is pushing them via various insentives and legislation. China has very bullish projections, I think they want 25% of all new vehicle sales to be EV by 2024. EV stocks by nature are factoring in projections for 5, 10 years from now, so I think sales multiples aren't hugely telling here"
04/01/2021,stocks,Will EV markets go up? Absolutely. Will the whole car industry go up? My guess is stays about the same as now. The big question is which companies benefit. Will the new players conquer market share or will the established car manufacturers defend their position? Whoever gets these answers right earns every penny he gets as returns from his investments.
04/01/2021,stocks,calls all the way baby
04/01/2021,stocks,"For reference the chip shortage was the result of tech companies as a whole understandably not ordering semiconductors in bulk before the pandemic started. Once lockdowns kicked in consumers ordered more and more tech to use at home which resulted in semiconductor manufacturers being inundated with requests. Once this happened companies like car and video game consoles manufacturers wound up being stuck in the queue waiting to receive orders for more chips.

So that situation is gradually getting better as people are getting vaccinated and ordering less handheld tech."
04/01/2021,stocks,Lol the chip shortage affects every EV and even FORD is shutting down like 5 plants.
04/01/2021,stocks,"They DID halt production, and they still beat their record because they have been increasing factory shifts etc. There is a lot of cHiNa BaD sentiment in the market, take it with a pinch if salt, but Nio is so transparent and easy to understand"
04/01/2021,stocks,Public transport in the suburbs? Doubt it.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Yeah that would be ideal, but Nio is for higher earners, as cars cost over 230,000 yuan. The people that can afford those don't take public transport, in general.  China has more high net worth individuals now than the US, so even if luxury EV there is a niche, there should be a sufficient population to purchase them. It remains to be known what the impact of luxury european EVs will be on domestic production, but I don't think that (barring a government limit on individual vehicle ownership) those with means will remit the freedom of individual vehicle ownership. I've never been to china, so I don't know the nuances of their society and values as they relate to individual vehicle ownership vs public transport."
04/01/2021,stocks,">public transport is the future 

yes, but on what fuel"
04/01/2021,stocks,"While we're playing make believe, socialism definitely works and capitalism represents a fair and balanced system ;)

Fossil fuels are dead (literally and figuratively).  EVs are the transitional technology to ween us off them."
04/01/2021,stocks,"April fools, haha you got some people."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Who are you? An oil seller or a 10 yo kid who doesn't have his/her mother's consent to post on the internet. The EV are the future 100%. With everyone owning an electric car, the prices will definitely fall to affordable values"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Both are gonna be huge. it can never be public transport completely, except for well, WELL into the future."
04/01/2021,stocks,lmao no one wants to use public transport if they can afford to avoid it.
04/01/2021,stocks,"More likely an EV rental system which disincentivises ownership. Kind of like a self driving, EV Uber which aggregates nearby requests into ride sharing toward common destinations."
04/01/2021,stocks,The market and consumer trends seem to disagree with you.
04/01/2021,stocks,Public transportation is gross tbh
04/01/2021,stocks,Hope you are right! I am holding a big bag on BB and decided yesterday that instead of cutting my losses I doubled down and doubled my position. They have a bright future IMO
04/01/2021,stocks,"Just because it didn't cause issues doesn't mean it wasn't a massive risk. Peoples understanding of risk is so bad.

And who knows, all those things could still happen."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Same, got a $37 average. I’ll take it"
04/01/2021,stocks,i love your positive thinking 👍🏻 no sell no loss
04/01/2021,stocks,If you average down you'll have a lot better time with that. I bought in at $54 and my current average price is $41 with 4x as much money as before
04/01/2021,stocks,I DCA from 45\~35. I bought more stock at 40 than 35 but it happens.
04/01/2021,stocks,No way. It was me selling off my Tech ETFs 2 days ago. that raised the entire market.
04/01/2021,stocks,"I think we all know the projections - the issue is that you are buying companies already factoring astronomical growth into their prices. If they hit any snags along the road, the price will be flattened like a pancake (Elon's words, not mine). And none of these companies aside from Tesla are cash flow positive - or anywhere close to it. So in order to keep their doors open, they will sell stock and dilute your holdings for the next 3, 5, 10 years. 
I would think that the only way to really pick the winners here (still a huge gamble) would be if you intimately knew the technology (if you worked in the EV industry in some regard). I have asked this a couple times on EV threads, and it doesn't seem that anyone has any sort of edge there that is commenting on these forums. So at that point, I would ask - what are you seeing that the market is not already seeing?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Damn this type of speculation is exactly why I love the stock market. It's hard to say that the newcomers will dominate when established players can just throw money at it, but damn the newcomers have an advantage in being early adopters. Should be an interesting decade for the EV sector."
04/01/2021,stocks,...not Nio. Because they don't make busses lmao.
04/01/2021,stocks,If I hold for 10 years I don't think day-to-day will be a big deal. (My way of coping with a bad investment)
04/01/2021,stocks,"Very good point actually and it's a very good question. Indo question ""the market""'s logic sometimes though. I've been in Nio since $4 and in very familiar with their company AND their stock just from watching it for a year. Had no doubt in my mind that it was a bargain at $50, and yet it got sold off all the way to nearly $32 I believe. Assuming I'm proven right (we're not back to $50 yet and it could take months), I think the 'market' panicked and was irrational. Other than that long convoluted answer, I guess the market is scared of Chinese companies. Hypothetically, if Nio were American (still assuming the large Chinese market etc), I think it would be valued far higher than it is. Maybe the China bears will be proven right if a massive trade war or otherwise breaks out, but I guess that's the gamble some Nio Investors are taking that others aren't willing to. Btw I appreciate an actually intelligent and logical bear angle"
04/01/2021,stocks,i'm asking what will power public transport vehicles
04/01/2021,stocks,They don't make fuel either. EVs run on magic!
04/01/2021,stocks,BYD
04/01/2021,stocks,"I have stayed away because I have little to no understanding of the technology - the advantages / disadvantages of battery-powered EV vs. Hydrogen, etc. I like to stick to industries that are connected to either the industry I work in (construction), or products/services that I am familiar with. I have always watched the EV space and thought insiders could probably make a killing if they understand the nuances between each company's technology."
04/01/2021,stocks,"One very interesting aspect of nio is the battery swapping/rental. It's the make/break for a lot of people. Apart from the idea that it can be an alternative to charging wait times, renting the battery makes the entry price point cheaper, allows customers to upgrade their rental scheme to a newer, better battery when one becomes available, and, perhaps most importantly, it means that the resale value of Nio vehicles will not be intrinsically tied to the battery (if you chose to rent the battery instead of purchase). The CEO Li Bin has experience in the car re-selling industry. I'm still not entirely sure where I stand on the battery rental/ swapping but I'm leaning to thinking it's great. Tesla experimented with it years ago but ultimately decided it wasn't worth the effort"

04/01/2021,stocks,"13.9k will be interesting to watch on the Nasdaq-100 if we're heading there. If that trades in regular trading hours and rejects in the next 1-2 weeks, that will likely solidify a similar case to May-October 2019 where you saw rangebound trading for several months. 

Would also go along with 3k was extremely, and I mean extremely tough for the S&P in 2019. It made it over and then corrected in July that year. I think it has more room here, but it could be 4.1-4.2k, then correct."

I thought I understood margin accounts, but maybe I truly am an idiot. And I fully anticipate being flamed for ""using margin but not fully understanding it"".

Nearly all of my holdings are significantly green today. When I look at $GOOGL for example, ""Today's Return shows +$575"". $DIS shows ""Today's Return +$175"". I could go on, but scrolling thru my tickers I am up a few thousand. Even the few in the red wouldn't offset my unrealized gains at the moment.

Why is my overall equity only up a few hundred dollars? Isn't the (risky) point of margin to be able to take advantage of gains on days like this?

04/01/2021,stocks,It depends on your reasons. If you're thinking of new stocks to diversify and lessen your risk exposure because your existing stocks are too volatile then your answer is clear. If you're wanting to buy new stocks because you've seen something you like and believe will go up considerably then your answer is clear. You need to think about what your overall plan is. Your risk appetite will drive a lot of decisions as it should.

04/01/2021,stocks,"I been saying this for ages. When the meme stocks ran in January for a short while, the market tanked and vice versa. 

In March we had nearly a whole month of the meme stocks being 'relevant'.

04/01/2021,stocks,"I won't talk you out of it because I think debt is still insanely cheap this year and that the market just got fudded to crap, which probably makes sense after an administration change and a pandemic and a year of growth and  GME/WSB, etc.

First of all whatever you do, you should not lump sum it. Maybe we passed the bottom, but there's no guarantee.

Google Ark holdings. Do your own research, if you like their picks, then that is a good way to pick some growth without going too crazy. Ark has shown very nice resistance twice in the last month at about 109. I don't think you're betting your house if you're buying a few Ark stocks right now, it looks like nice risk/reward to me this far from it's ATHs, when we just got a nice correction and last year already showed us a preview of the future market and industries."

04/01/2021,stocks,Any new news?
04/01/2021,stocks,"No, because if this kind of behavior continues, volatility is about to die (if it's not already dead), and that will screw over both sides options wise."
04/01/2021,stocks,"My take is that so long as the euphoria continues and reopening prospects look promising, the market will probably continue to climb in the next few months **unless** we have negative catalysts crop up that make investors scared (like the recent hedge fund going bust). Regardless the high won't last forever, even if the news remains good, at least because expectations are so lofty and that's a recipe for disappointment."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I hope so as well. I did a lot of buying across March, dramatically growing positions and adding new ones. I’m curious to see if it pays off. I’m making the bet that March was a once or twice per year buying opportunity.

I do regret buying a little more BB and some EV a few weeks ago, but otherwise I’m really satisfied with where I’m at."
04/01/2021,stocks,"We almost certainly will, baring something catastrophic occurring in the market later this year. That March correction we just left was a perfectly healthy pullback that sets us up for continued rallies ahead. I certainly bought the hell out of that dip, lol."

04/01/2021,stocks,Comments like these make me think we in a bottom with all this fear about market never going up again.
04/01/2021,stocks,As long as you feed your account with cash on the way down margin is fine. And as long as your positions aren’t too volatile. At this point I dont hold a single position that I think would go so far down even if it hits the moving average that would trigger a margin call.

04/01/2021,stocks,"If you want to buy back and get the order filled without as much regard for price efficiency, you need to submit with a bid higher than the ask price. 

That's the minimum price anyone is currently willing to sell for that has limit orders sitting and waiting for fills.

The mark price is typically just some mid-point value between the bid-ask that doesn't necessarily represent what people are buying/selling the contracts for. 

> It’s 2 weeks out, I would imagine there would be some bids, it’s not that outrageous is it? 

Considering VUG is sitting at 260 right now, and the highest it's ever been was ~269 a month and a half ago, and isn't prone to very erratic volatility that could +10%/-10% in a day, the probability it reaches 280+ within 2 weeks is close to nil. 

There are no bids because statistically those contracts are 99.999% going to end up OTM by expiration.

If VUG experiences some strange, unexpected spike to like 270 within a couple of days, there may be some orders submitted on the bid side.

You're having these difficulties because you're dealing with options that have extremely low volume. There aren't a lot of buyers/sellers out there with limit orders sitting on exchanges."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Also,

> Apr 16 VUG 290 c, I want to buy back at a loss, and then it lowered. 

It sounds like you sold VUG 290 calls to open that expire on Apr 16?

Just let them expire worthless on the expiration date, and you collect 100% of the premium you received when you originally sold them."

As always, I suggest buying over the course of the day. Nibble a little bit at the opening, and then see how things are going.

04/01/2021,stocks,Nice
04/01/2021,stocks,I can't believe you've done this
04/01/2021,stocks,"I honestly thought i'd made a mistake by not selling yesteday as people would ""sell the news"" after biden's speech, but somehow it continues to rally.  I don't see it going to previous highs tho in the short term, that was peak EV euphoria when tesla was at 900"
04/01/2021,stocks,"They’re a trillion dollar company, what kind of run up are you expecting on no news?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Gourds, obviously"
04/01/2021,stocks,profit from what lol it's been flat as fuck for 4 months
04/01/2021,stocks,Congratulations lol
04/01/2021,stocks,"I saw the news about the owner which affects VLDR specifically, but the whole market for lidar has slid a bit. The jump today was nice though. I just don’t know if these companies just very sensitive to the market being speculative tech or what’s dropped them so far. Chip shortage maybe too?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Yeah, it would hve coasted the rest of the day with everything else otherwise. Tesla is a roller coaster though, getting what we pay for."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I bought near the high so for me I'm averaging down, it's a long hold as well so current price doesn't matter as much to me. I can see it going a lot higher in the future."
04/01/2021,stocks,That's a good point
04/01/2021,stocks,Same. Not willing to buy more though
04/01/2021,stocks,I really like Square and where they are headed. I wish I had more cash back at under $210 to get more shares but two months of bloody chum didn't leave me with much mula
04/01/2021,stocks,Exactly one year ago on their chart the same exact thing happened too...I need to save this date..
04/01/2021,stocks,I hope so. I’ve skimmed a little off just in case.
04/01/2021,stocks,Can you explain why? I had been interested but people were saying all the apps created with it are pretty mediocre.

04/01/2021,stocks,"I don't see it.

It's an interesting side storyline but the real story is the structural flows that guide the S&P have returned. The script that's been playing this year is that every time monthly options expire, the market is weak and prone to a large sell, which has verified three times.

I'm also still not sure that you can call that 6% move in the S&P from the panic early March low as anything other than a nice move and rally. It got it to where it was working on 21.5% after October 30th. And when the market did weaken afterward, this index's behavior was a lot stronger than mid February-early March."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the response.

If I’m sure of the investments. Do you like the method of how I divide my deposits"
04/01/2021,stocks,Hopefully. Another 6 more green days and I'll be back at my ATHs.
04/01/2021,stocks,"No. The market felt *significantly* stronger than this back in February. At that point we were riding months of growth, with speculation bubbles everywhere in the market. Toppish signals abounded. This is literally just a two-day-old rally, nothing like the rally we were on before the healthy correction. Not even close."
04/01/2021,stocks,This is why I don't sell covered calls
04/01/2021,stocks,"Got that sweet, sweet 1.5% return!"
04/01/2021,stocks,Its thursday bro
04/01/2021,stocks,"Well I'm far from an expert but usually when things shoot up like that they come cratering down next day.

I really would love to know what the catalyst is for that tremendous growth in the past 48 hours"
04/01/2021,stocks,"I'm also waiting for it to pull back. They just had a great quarter which caused the jump. Their earnings estimates for the coming year show a pull back, followed by growth\*.

\* Based on SeekingAlpha charts which aren't always accurate."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I first had buy target at 24.5, but changed to 24.7 for 750 shares. Happy I waited a month through lockup, day before scared me though with that 10% rocket"
04/01/2021,stocks,It just seemed to be performing better then most other European ETFs in terms of recovering from the pandemic bust
04/01/2021,stocks,"Nope. And that's the problem with this once-great stock. It's stuck in the hell of uncertainty until we know for sure what the CCP's plans are, long-term, for Baba. And nothing is pressing China to release those details. Sad to say, but I rotated out of Baba during this correction into U.S. tech stocks, and Baba had been my biggest position."
04/01/2021,stocks,Thanks
04/01/2021,stocks,"Legit thanks on this.  Was meaning to keep an eye on SOXL today and try to grab some, got distracted at work, just got some about 3 minutes ago and already up almost a half percent.  Thats never happened before.  For me, I buy, and by the time I'm back to my homepage 2 seconds later I'm already down."
04/01/2021,stocks,My first buy on them was at $139.31. Lmao. That after hours dip to $109.50 a few weeks back really helped though because I bought it hard.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Rebought in hard when it dropped 5% after hours a week or two ago and that really helped. I was able to get in there at $109.50, which is the only reason I’m green now, but it still counts!"
04/01/2021,stocks,Nio just announced good deliverys. 20k+ cars in first 3 months
04/01/2021,stocks,What % margin is recommended
04/01/2021,stocks,"My margin stocks are AMD, MSTR and PLTR. Mostly AMD though"
04/01/2021,stocks,"The index that got hit the hardest in mid-February-early March really isn't that far away from its own ATH.

..."
04/01/2021,stocks,Thanks for the reply.. mind if I DM you?
04/01/2021,stocks,"Ohhhh I see; so if my 2020 taxes owed was $100k, as long as I pay $100k in estimated taxes I wont be penalized even if I make $20 million in 2021. I’ll just have a crazy tax bill come the end of the year."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Got it, so any estimated tax payments based on 2021 capital gains wouldn’t happen until 2022"
04/01/2021,stocks,">	Damn wtf are you in.

Top 10 holdings (in order) in my portfolio are

1.	T

4.	AAPL

7.	WFC
8.	BA
9.	IRM

04/01/2021,stocks,This is terrible advice
04/01/2021,stocks,"lol, yes. My bad."
04/01/2021,stocks,$HON $CAT?
04/01/2021,stocks,We'll see.
04/01/2021,stocks,Thank you 💗
04/01/2021,stocks,"2.3% in one of my accounts where I have 2/3rd of my portfolio (it was actually 3.2% an hour or so ago)

1.2% on the second one where I have a bit less than 1/3rd of my portfolio

0.8% percent on my third ""mini portfolio"" that I am holding about 6% of my portfolio

So it is going awesome so far. Jesus didn't die for nothing!:-)"
04/01/2021,stocks,Idk its been trending up for a month steadily. I imagine ny and Mexico legalizing will only push it higher. Its like the only Canadian weed stock with good Financials.  Also high inside ownership.
04/01/2021,stocks,I just asked the same question to my financial guy... He told me that I would not. But I'd definitely check specifically about your individual case
04/01/2021,stocks,If it dips any further I'm doing leaps on top of shares
04/01/2021,stocks,Yeah we like buying low selling high wtf.
04/01/2021,stocks,Thats correct but wouldnt the average stay the same then? Why would the single share cost average move up?
04/01/2021,stocks,Possibly but Ive never sold ARKK stocks until today. So its strange.
04/01/2021,stocks,Cost average is 388 but have been under a rock since 😩😩
04/01/2021,stocks,Thanks for the response. Which would you prefer then in the travel sector or maybe health. Instead of BA
04/01/2021,stocks,It’s actually sell in may and go away..
04/01/2021,stocks,I got so many tech stocks cheap this march felt good.
04/01/2021,stocks,and a wack valuation still imo
04/01/2021,stocks,Why would PR be relevant for them since they don't have a consumer product?
04/01/2021,stocks,PR problem with what?
04/01/2021,stocks,it was a flat line. no dip no breakout
04/01/2021,stocks,Have you used a Samsung?
04/01/2021,stocks,Their PE also makes for an interesting comparison
04/01/2021,stocks,"tech going to bleed sideways for years and years, its overvalued. re-allocate a portion into value (boomer/materials/etc.)"
04/01/2021,stocks,Check out SMH
04/01/2021,stocks,"What do you mean? That P/E ratio of 1200 doesn't scream ""value""?"
04/01/2021,stocks,Is he even raising the tax rate to what it used to be?
04/01/2021,stocks,\^
04/01/2021,stocks,+1 for fooled here
04/01/2021,stocks,"ok, video done. now where do I submit it?"
04/01/2021,stocks,Isn’t that the rule for WSB? So seriously... where are these rules lol
04/01/2021,stocks,This is the way
04/01/2021,stocks,"Lol, you got me!"
04/01/2021,stocks,Smart play. Rules are made to be broken occasionally
04/01/2021,stocks,What do you mean?
04/01/2021,stocks,\*2
04/01/2021,stocks,Day traders or last 2 days? Some stocks were easily 7% up last 2 days. Could be worth taking those gains
04/01/2021,stocks,"thanks. but no worries, on my long time portfolio which I created in february I'm only up by .79%. time is the key."
04/01/2021,stocks,"The chip shortage seems to be having an impact everywhere. I'm hopeful that we see more partnerships with City's seeking ""smart city"" development. I've read about VLDR sensors being used for automation in factories and airports. If they can take advantage of that there is serious cash flow opportunities. Same with LAZR."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Like, how long of a hold we are talking here?"
04/01/2021,stocks,Same - will just hang on to the ARKs I have without adding more for now. The last couple of months have shown me that I am probably happier keeping my money in index tracking ETFs and a few blue chips...
04/01/2021,stocks,Super interesting. Really low volume on the stock
04/01/2021,stocks,"If you’re reading opinions on Reddit where hardcore gamers are a significant majority then yeah they would say that. The problem is Reddit underestimates and doesn’t understand mobile gaming. It’s not about whether a game is innovative or makes you emote in the mobile space, it’s about making a loop addicting to where users keep coming back and paying. Skillz doesn’t make games, it provides a framework for others to make games and put them on their service, and on screen engagement on Skillz dwarfs many other very popular apps. 


Definitely worth reading into them some more and looking at their financials"
04/01/2021,stocks,"The math shows that, on average, there is more benefit from putting it all in at once rather than DCA investing. Time in the market beats timing the market, the saying goes.

However, and this is not financial advice, but I DCA because it's better for my mental state. I sleep more comfortably and am more sure that I'm not buying at a bad time and am happy to take the average."
04/01/2021,stocks,It's Friday for the market! Not open tomorrow
04/01/2021,stocks,"The markets are closed tomorrow; ergo, it's Friday today?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"i think its manipulation. low volume.

I always jump on these and lose money so i didnt.

could have doubled my money lol. Oh well"
04/01/2021,stocks,But they are still undervalued now. People might realise that and it might not dip again. Also high short interest
04/01/2021,stocks,all i'm reading is baba on discount
04/01/2021,stocks,Thanks for the news. I was able to average down to 38 last week. Cool!
04/01/2021,stocks,"You should never use any.

I know, this isn't a very fun answer by me, but it's an excellent way to get roasted."
04/01/2021,stocks,"AMD is a fantastic long hold. Especially if you bought it near the recent ""bottom"" of 75-78 range 

I am sadly not familiar with MSTR 

As for PLTR, I have mixed feelings. I used to be a shareholder but in the recent correction I sold my shares (for profit) and moved that money to either value (to hedge) or to big/mid cap tech. I think PLTR has a phenomenal future but it seems to constantly underperform tech"
04/01/2021,stocks,Sure
04/01/2021,stocks,"I can't exclude some complicated situation making it due on 2020 taxes, but I regard it as very unlikely. As always if in doubt contact a tax attorney."
04/01/2021,stocks,where were you the last 5ish weeks?
04/01/2021,stocks,Because if you remove the ones you bought at 114 from the dataset the cost basis is going to go up.
04/01/2021,stocks,when did you buy those last 3 shares?
04/01/2021,stocks,">	Cost average is 388

You’re winning, don’t worry"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Health? ABT is my pick given their diversified businesses and amazing performance over time. Plenty of people like ABBV as well.

In travel I don't really see much. Airlines don't make much money long-term and reopening seems priced in and then some. Maybe a hotel chain: I like IHG most as a company. Other big public chains include HLT, MAR, CHH, and WH."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Alternatively, I think BA is one of the safest stocks to be in for the next couple years."
04/01/2021,stocks,Trade due to rhymes and you'll lose all your dimes
04/01/2021,stocks,"Tsla has a wack valuation as well, but not if you’re holding till 2030"
04/01/2021,stocks,You really need me to explain to you why bad PR can affect a companies stock?
04/01/2021,stocks,The fact their tech is used to spy on you.
04/01/2021,stocks,"No, i have a vizio and its fucking crap. I have Sony with google TV and chinese brand with Roku. Google TV is the best for me."
04/01/2021,stocks,Bleed sideways for years? Bet you didnt think a computer would fit in your pocket 20 years ago either
04/01/2021,stocks,No. Not even to Bush/Obama levels. Corporate taxes will remain at all time lows
04/01/2021,stocks,"28%? Yup.

Edit: 35% under the previous administrations of Obama and Bush."
04/01/2021,stocks,Ffs. Think I just got fooled.
04/01/2021,stocks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKbU8B-QVZk
04/01/2021,stocks,Where did you put your money to achieve a 500% return?
04/01/2021,stocks,"10 years+

Their biggest IP is GTA and they don't release too often, with the way GTAV is raking in money they next one will likely be delayed. They don't have to release as often, and they can take their time on quality."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Tbh I almost bought more arkf, but arkk is just scary. I had reservations before but I want nothing to do with tesla"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Thank for the input.  I'm aware they don't make the games and just provide the framework. But the argument I was given is that if the best games it can produce are mediocre, then it may never gain the necessary traction."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Even if I've done my research, I still  usually lack the confidence to stick to my play, unless I've actually physically watched the stock move for at least a couple weeks. Having a mental understanding of its movement...that familiarity let's me work without as much emotion. Guess it's different for everyone."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Time in the market and DCA is the way, but not if you're starting with a pile of savings. If OP wants to be aggressive with it and put in 50% right away I won't talk them out of it, but lump summing a high amount is not sound advice."
04/01/2021,stocks,Why
04/01/2021,stocks,"Super low volume. Yeah I know if I bought I would have lost it all. Instead on the sidelines it doubles again today.

Oh well."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Same as me, first got in at 50."
04/01/2021,stocks,"What exactly about margin investing is so bad?
Is it because you no longer really have the option to ""hold"" when things get bad and are forced to sell to avoid margin call?"
04/01/2021,stocks,Is AMD worth to hold on margin though? I'm trying to figure out if big tech is just getting rotated into now or starting to exit
04/01/2021,stocks,Buying dips.
04/01/2021,stocks,Last week. Oh.. I think I get why it did it now. I thought it was 30 days from a sell date that incurred a loss.
04/01/2021,stocks,Did... did you just create a paradox?
04/01/2021,stocks,"Sure, I'm not saying it doesn't go up, but I think it makes it more likely to underperform over that same 9 year period you referenced. Who knows. I've been wrong before, and will be again."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Yes please enlighten me. PR sure affects stocks but it depends.  If it's a company that has a consumer product revenue might be affected by bad PR and therefore is the stock price. But you don't see oil prices going down because of the climate change debate for example, do you? Or do you think companies like 3M will say ""oh no we don't want to optimize our supply chain with their product because some people are afraid they are getting spyed on with their product"""
04/01/2021,stocks,Do you own a smartphone?
04/01/2021,stocks,"Sony makes good stuff. My old vizio was dank before it’s resolution became outdated. Regardless, their stock is still a crazy deal, has a low PE, and they’ve done solid business since they started."
04/01/2021,stocks,Uhhhh it was 35%. Trump cut it to 21%. 28% is a good compromise.
04/01/2021,stocks,"It was 31% until 2018, so no, they are not getting raised to what they used to be."
04/01/2021,stocks,Yep. Badly and publicly. Happy April Fools Day!
04/01/2021,stocks,"Gamestop, back in January. I had an Avg. of $60."
04/01/2021,stocks,I hear you. Cheers man
04/01/2021,stocks,How do you feel about ARKG and ARKW?
04/01/2021,stocks,Good Friday
04/01/2021,stocks,"Any investment carries inherent risk, but I'd sleep better at night holding AMD on margin over say PLTR, especially if you bought the former near the ""bottom"" in this recent correction

As for the rotation into tech, it seems the rotation has somewhat begun as indicated by the last few days. It's hard to say whether this is the beginning of the actual rotation into tech or just a bounce because tech was oversold. I'd say give it until Monday/next week to see if the recent green days hold, and if so, then I think it's safer to say that the tech rotation has begun"
04/01/2021,stocks,"You love buying dips more than actually making money. Again, you're weird, but I'm sure the institutional investors love what you're doing."
04/01/2021,stocks,😉
04/01/2021,stocks,I think this is a bad company with a PR problem. Just as I said. Not interested in your whataboutism.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Yes I live in a society, doesn't mean I can't be critical of companies developing social credit systems."
04/01/2021,stocks,The new flagship Sony TVs just destroys any TV from any manufacturer. Sony is undervalued right now lol.
04/01/2021,stocks,"I hold both. Arkg is a long ways off imo

Arkw is kind of played out

Jmo"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Ok no discussion here just arrogance and repetition of your first statement, got it 👍"
04/01/2021,stocks,So many companies basically spy on you. You'd almost need to stay out of tech completely if that bothers you
04/01/2021,stocks,"Definitely agree Sony is the TV King. I’ve traded Sony a bunch in the past. Still seems like a great time to buy VZIO. it’s ipo was underwhelming last week because people were distracted by G m E, but the brand has been pretty solid since it started."
04/01/2021,stocks,"ok cool, its still an ethical issue."
04/01/2021,stocks,Yeah I get it. I just don't that stuff like this ever affects the price. Just look at google or FB for example
04/01/2021,stocks,"Google and facebook just collect the data they get from people using their services, palantir provides the tools to use that data to spy on you. Plus they are very opaque about it, partially because their biggest customers are government organizations like ICE and NSA."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Well I thought I was finished with GME but I bought back in yesterday. The Amazon stock I bought was too boring, even though I think it is a great long-term hold.

I am down to three questions now: Do they let you trade immediately with the funds from a sale like Robinhood does, or do you have to wait?  For example- Say I sell $5000 of stock A because I want to put the money in stock B. Am I able to buy stock B right after I sell stock A or do I have to wait for the funds to settle first? Also, If I buy stock B am I unable to sell it right away because I have to wait for the funds to settle? Also, from what I read yesterday it sounds like TD does not do fractional trades. Is that correct? Finally, if Schwab is buying TD then wouldn't it make more sense to use Schwab instead if TD, or are they just taking ownership and leaving the platforms alone? Also open to other ideas, I really do not want to be switching around. I am hoping to settle on one broker and stick with them for the long term. I am leaning toward Fidelity at this point. BTW, I prefer to trade on my PC rather than my phone if that makes a difference, The advice from here has been great! I can learn more here in hours than I can reading boring stuff on the platforms all day. Plus it is based on real experience, which is a big plus. "

Thank you."

  2)We all know Henrik Fisker failed badly in the years 2011-2013 when he tried to take his grand idea of a company into reality. But the very fact that his name is still out there and people still have respect for him shows something about the trust there is out there in him, so when President Biden will unveil the green bill it’s very likely that Fisker will be part of it. 

  3)Even more than that- Joe Biden was the won that put Henrik Fiskers green energy ambitions into the spotlight when he signed deals with him in 2012-2013. So I’m thinking he probably still friends with Biden and will get a significant amount in that Bill. (We all know there is prejudice and undercover stuff involved in these stuff☺️ and it’s worth to mention that Hunter Biden is or was listed as a founder in the company). 

  4)Another strong reason why Fisker is a candidate for strong growth from the green bill is because the stock hasn’t really gone up too much yet unlike lots of it’s peers in that industry.

Not only this, but gambling is on the rise and expected to be an emerging industry at $3.2B for the USA ([source](https://g-mnews.com/sports-betting-and-igaming-outlook-in-the-united-states/)). With such juicy markets, you can tell why people are excited about the prospects of a new entrant poised to take advantage of these trends. There's only one problem...

**SKLZ is neither a game company nor a gambling company**
---

In a lot of DD that I see, they are comparing SKLZ valuation with other gaming companies or gambling companies. However, fundamentally, SKLZ does not match any of these.

> SKLZ is not a gaming company

SKLZ does not make any games itself. It is reliant on 3rd party independent developers to create games and monetize them. I'm not saying this is a bad thing. SKLZ has consistently gotten popular games onto its platform. My only point here is that **while SKLZ can ride overall mobile gaming trends, you cannot compare SKLZ to other mobile gaming companies**. It's comparing apples to oranges. Thus, any DD that relies on this as a method of valuation is fundamentally flawed.

> SKLZ is not a gambling company

SKLZ, as its name suggests, is skill-based matchmaking for money. The majority of people *lose* in this model. While its games may incorporate chance within them, the very purpose of SKLZ's product is that people **compete** for money. This is as much gambling as a League of Legends tournament is. Once more, this isn't a negative, I just want to say that any DD ([like this one](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/22/3-gambling-stocks-poised-for-a-bull-run/)) relying on this comparison or expecting SKLZ to ride on the iGaming tailwinds is invalid.

Even SKLZ makes comparisons like [this](https://imgur.com/WHnWUvh). They should know better.

**So how do we correctly value SKLZ then?**
---

SKLZ attempts to capture a portion of the mobile gaming market. Now what is this portion?

- Age range: 18-40 (https://imgur.com/iPARna5)

- Simple, non-AAA games ([see list of current games as source](https://games.skillz.com/))

- Competitive multiplayer games

All these, I consider bad for the company. 

So, let's dig deeper into how I came up with this list and what it means for SKLZ. For the purposes of this DD, I'll focus primarily on USA where SKLZ has its most business. Obviously, they want to expand internationally, but there are issues with that which I'll later discuss.

**Age**

The actual target market SKLZ wants to be in is gamers age 45+ ([source](https://www.mmaglobal.com/research/myth-busting-mobile-gaming-demographics)).

https://imgur.com/YDAOoq7

> The significance of the older gaming consumer is further reinforced by research from the mobile gaming community, MocoSpace. The findings of this study reveal a direct correlation between the amounts of money spent on virtual goods within social games and gamer age - the older the gamer, the more they spend. Based on the study, 70% of all the gamers over 45 years bought virtual goods.

Furthermore, in terms of population, gamers 18-45 years old have about the same number of people as gamers 45+ ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players-since-2010/)). This means that the lion's share of the opportunity of SKLZ is locked away in a target audience that they have failed to reach. Obviously, they can try to reach this audience, but this brings me back to one of my earlier points: SKLZ is not a mobile gaming company. They don't get to decide who uses their platform or not. It's up to other game devs to do so and by the prevalence of their current demographic, we already know who SKLZ game devs caters towards.

Even as we talk about the growth of mobile gaming, most of that growth is captured in the 45+ age range as well as the under 18 age range ([source](https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-people-over-age-of-45-started-mobile-gaming-2020-than-any-other-age-group)).

My overall point is this: while SKLZ will certainly benefit from mobile gaming trends, it will not benefit as much as investors think it will. Its growth is overstated from a fundamental misunderstanding of the actual mobile gaming market.

**Simple, non-AAA games**

My first introduction to SKLZ was when they announced their NFL partnership. One thing that a lot of people thought was that some awesome football-based, Madden clone would use the SKLZ platform ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcn02f/your_thoughts_on_sklz/)). People think that SKLZ is going to go into the esports market which is plain wrong. SKLZ, on their own website, says that they built their platform for competitors left out of the esports market!

Furthermore, money-based tournaments is not a new idea. While SKLZ has a good implementation of this idea, AAA developers have this figured out already. Just look at League of Legends, Call of Duty, or any other current esport out there. They all have online tournaments with monetary prizes. No AAA developers would use SKLZ when SKLZ takes 18% of the gross.

For a small-time developer with a prize pool of $100, that's only $18. But imagine a prize pool of $2.34M ([League of Legend's 2020 prize pool](https://www.statista.com/statistics/749024/league-of-legends-championships-prize-pool/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20LoL%20World,2.23%20million%20a%20year%20earlier.)). Why would they spend $300k+ on licensing when they can build a similar product for $500k and use it next year as well? Obviously, this isn't a perfect example, but my point still stands: **AAA developers can imitate SKLZ's platform cheaply**.

**Competitive multiplayer games**

Obviously, SKLZ can't exist in single player games. Nor can it exists in non-competitive games. If we look at the popularity of mobile games by type, you'll see...

https://imgur.com/AP4sKzA

That player vs player games is among the least played. Not to say its not played, but it's certainly towards the bottom. Not only that, if you look at the most popular mobile games currently available, you'll notice some big name competitive multiplayer mobile games on that list ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-played_mobile_games_by_player_count)). What this means is that the 15% available market is already being eaten up by AAA games which we already know SKLZ has no access to.

In terms of the popularity of their games, it really worries me that for the past 5 years, they have coasted off the same 5 games. From their own investor presentation, they say this though they claim its a positive:

https://imgur.com/byehp8r

Notice the lack of new additions to their popular games. They seemed to have found a few breakout games early and haven't been able to move past them. Those games are losing popularity over the years and SKLZ will need new ones to bolster their business. They've had 5 years to do it, they haven't.

**In conclusion...**
---

Based upon the points above, I believe investors expect unrealistic growth from SKLZ and thus, its current stock is overvalued. All analysis I've seen so far have been flawed from a fundamental misunderstanding of SKLZ as a company and the sole product they offer.

So, what do I think is a fair valuation?

Well, let's look at the market they serve. Gaming in the US is worth $21.9B currently. Their target age range of 18-40 captures ~50% of that, though this age range spends less money so we'll bring that number down to 40% (personal estimate). The type of game they need is 15% of this market of which 75% (personal estimate) is captured by AAA games which they don't have access to. Thus if we do the math, their current business model can capture:

**$21.9B * 40% * 15% * 25% = 0.3285B or $328.5M.**

Their current revenue is $230M (already close to capturing the max value) with promises to double next year and again the year after. The only way this is possible is if they expand their age range to gamers 45+, but remember, SKLZ does not control this at all. It's up to the game devs that use their platform. SKLZ has no say in it and current market trends is still gearing games towards gamers age 18-40.

I see no way that SKLZ can maintain their current promises to investors.

---

But /u/jraywang, you say, SKLZ's revenues have already doubled this year and their financials are great!

Yes. I agree that they have a solid balance sheet. Their cash is at ~$260M and their liabilities are at $50M. This is a great assets to liabilities ratio. Also, it is true that their revenues grew by 92% in 2020 which indicates that they might be able to do it again for 2021. Part of this can be attributed to COVID, but part of it, we must give SKLZ credit.

Though, one thing that worries me, you can find in their income statement: **their marketing expense** ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKLZ/financials/)).

From 2019 to 2020, their marketing expense went up by **250%** (from ~$100M to ~$250M which is more than their total revenue)

As a result, they increased revenues by **92%** (from $120M to $230M).

Not only did they have COVID tailwinds, but they had insane marketing, yet were unable to recoup their expense through revenue expansion. This is fine **if** they can get their users to stick to their platforms. 

**One HUGE call out I want to make: their user is not the gamer. Their user is the game developer.**
---

And 99% of mobile game developers fail to profit ([source](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-999-of-all-mobile-games-are-not-profitable-the-6-things-mobile-game-developers-must-do-to-survive-2012-2))."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I totally agree!

I've been a competetive gamer my whole life and the games they are offering are absolut garbage. From a company valued so high you expect them to have at least one solid game on their platform. 

Besides, there are so many gaming platforms already. Who needs another one?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Good write up, thanks!

In general I think you touched upon a main difficulty when valuing some of these growth stocks and their general business models. 

Namely does revenue growth matter so much if they are spending more to acquire these customers than the revenue they receive from them? 

Ultimately that’s not a sustainable business proposition."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I have been reading up on this company myself, and there are just so many things that put me off. I have enjoyed playing games competitively my entire life. I am **not** the target demographic.

First and foremost, their game selection is just hot garbage. Competitive solitaire and dominoes laying, really? Think I'm cherry-picking? Check out their 10-k examples [https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-21-004659/#i75cb0fd4a6c347ed9a48f507d265b119\_10](https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-21-004659/#i75cb0fd4a6c347ed9a48f507d265b119_10) and promotional video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evRTLde13hU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evRTLde13hU). ""I snapchatted my friends: 'Oh I just won $100 while playing against people while in labor'"". LOL

Next, they claim to host millions of tournaments daily. So who are they? I checked [skillz.reddit.com](https://skillz.reddit.com) (banned), and [skillzplayers.reddit.com](https://skillzplayers.reddit.com), which has 1.2k members. Lots of posts about people getting scammed (closing of their account for unknown reasons). Moreover, the consensus seems to be that, as OP points out, MMR will make you 50-50 in the long run. On youtube there is barely and Skillz content either, besides investing and sponsored content (which barely gets 10k views).

There is only one explanation for this. Which 'competitive' gamer does not user Reddit nor Youtube, and is interested in games like Solitaire and Dominos laying? Boomers. In the same 10-k Report, they state that >50% of their users are 45+, with only 10% being between 18-25, which doesn't surprise me in the least.

As OP mentions, their top 5 games account for almost all of their revenue. So what are their prospects? Again, quoting their 10-K risks:

>***A limited number of games historically have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue. If these games were to become less popular or be removed from our platform and we are unable to identify and market suitable replacements, our business and prospects could suffer.*** Historically, a small number of games and related developers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Solitaire Cube and 21 Blitz (each developed by Tether) together with Blackout Bingo (developed by Big Run) accounted for 79% of our revenue. Games developed by Tether and Big Run accounted for 87% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. These games, and the related developers, are subject to our standard terms of service, which include, among other things, developer exclusivity, as modified by negotiated agreements. The negotiated agreements provide Skillz with the discretion, but not the obligation, to provide marketing support for specified games and for revenue sharing with the developers that is more favorable to Skillz than our standard terms. These negotiated agreements restrict the removal of the applicable games from our platform for at least 12 months following termination. During the post-termination period, Skillz has the option, but not the obligation, to host paid competitions for such games on the platform. Consistent with our standard terms of service, our agreement with Tether may be terminated by either party on 30 days’ notice. Our agreement with Big Run is subject to termination by either party on an annual basis and by Skillz at any time at its discretion. If these games were to become less popular or be removed from our platform and we are unable to identify and market suitable replacements, our business and prospects could suffer.

That's right. Three games account for 79% of their revenue. Skillz has a contract with Tether that can be terminated upon a month's notice. Notice how there is also nothing to potentially address hedges against this risk.

Regarding the NFL deal ([https://www.skillz.com/nflchallenge/](https://www.skillz.com/nflchallenge/)), it's basically a competition among gamedevs to create the best NFL-related app. I have a hard time imagining anything cool will come out of this. What do you get in return? Some marketing buzzwords.

Skillz seems to provide a means of income for mobile gamedevs besides bombarding the users with ads. Their target dev seems to be the developers of all those shitty cash-grab apps we've come to hate. I mean just scroll around their games page [https://games.skillz.com/](https://games.skillz.com/). Or watch a promotional video. [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkillzPlayers/comments/lihtm2/dracula\_gemz\_on\_ios/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkillzPlayers/comments/lihtm2/dracula_gemz_on_ios/) You can't make this shit up lol

And this is where I have difficulty properly evaluating this company. As a younger, competitive gamer myself, everything about this company sets off my alarm bells. But boomers simply don't know any better."

Some hyper bulls that even I see as being was too optimistic somehow project as much as 500-750b $ in annual cad revenue (they basically expect Tesla to have 20-25% of global car sales in the future) which is absolutely insane, but just imagine if it did come to fruition , and then imagine the energy sector eclipsed that... 

Of course it’s all back of the napkin estimates and wishful thinking today, but in the future who knows what Tesla will achieve."

It's like how plastics really owe their existence to oil being cheap and plentiful as an energy source. We're just seeing the tip of the iceberg for how much things are going to change in the next decade just due to batteries.

$119 at the beginning of January 2017. I bought  1000/119= 8 shares = $952    Buying power $48

 03/17/2017  dividend is $0.27415 per share 

$0.27415 x 8 = $2.19

 06/16/2017 dividend is $0.37842 per share 

$0.37842 x 8 = $3.02 

 09/18/2017 dividend is  $0.31938 per share 

$0.31938 x 8 = $2.55

12/18/2017 dividend is $0.32941 per share

 $0.32941 x 8 = $2.63

04/01/2021,stocks,"Question about that, How can I re invest the dividends since the stock price is well over the dividend return? For example, the stock price is $119 and my first dividend pay out is $2.19, how can I re invest $2.19 when the stock costs $119?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Oh I see what you mean, you meant if my dividends pays out more than the cost of the stock I can re invest it so it will change the calculations a bit. I got it"

2021-04-01 07:20:22,stocks,"FUBO has big upside from recent selloff From it's peak of roughly $62 a few short months ago, to it's current $22 it has been a wild ride. Fubo is an incredible streaming service especially when it comes to sports. As a user and subscriber myself what they offer for $65 a month well worth it in addition to the $18 sports package. That to me is personally enough to ever need at a much cheaper price that cable. I'm just some stoner in my 20's what more would I need? Now imagine a shit ton of us starting to cut cable and move towards these streaming services? 

There is a growing market of ""cord cutters"" that is going to be in the millions. If Fubo can grow their marketing and grab a large chunk that will help its revenue grow substantially. Revenue that just topped 100m for it's first quarter ever. It should be noted that FUBO reacted positively to earnings and then the tech fuckery began. 

With their acquisition of Vigtory, a sports betting company, their goal to achieve a single platform tv screen and betting screen is extremely tangible. Imagine the amount of guys in their 20s and 30s who'd sign up for this shit. Not only would they be added subscribers, but they could go from a $65 a month subscriber to a few hundred or a few thousand. This is hopefully going to be implemented in the fall or early winter. 

With the recent rotation out of growth stocks, FUBO will rip back, as many of these stocks have fallen 50-60%, people will quickly rotate into them again. I don't see it being a slow bleed for much longer. With these sharp drops due to the selloff, it's looking attractive with a decent short float of 35%. This could very easily trigger a decent sized squeeze. 

Institutions love FUBO as well. It's riding at 63% institutional ownership at this point despite the beatdown. You would see them have exited their positions by now if this doesn't bounce back hard. 

$80+ EOY book it.

No, this isn't financial advice, I just love the fucking stock and think this it's just criminally undervalued at the current share price.

04/01/2021,stocks,"Everyone commenting in here probably doesn’t have Fubo. The service is great compared to any competitor. Hulu TV and Sling have been losing subscribers slowly because they either don’t have any channels or the picture is terrible. Their main competitor is YouTube TV, but Fubo is in a very good position against them right now. YouTube TV has more than doubled their prices over the past couple years, and still doesn’t have as many channels as Fubo. Fubo makes more money per subscriber than any other live streaming service, and their only going to continue to make more as they focus more on ad revenue (up 174% QoQ) and obviously through their sports betting addition. Bookies make a fuck ton of money, meaning they could potentially run their subscriptions at a loss and keep the price at $65, while getting the Turner channels back. At that point, there’d really be no reason to stay on other competitors."

Yes advertising will grow, but they need to raise pricing on their packages (there’s a reason all competitors have done this) to reach profitability and that will put pressure on subscriber numbers. 

They are not the only company innovating in sports betting on TV and in some ways they are disadvantaged by having to link their book to the streaming service. 

I also think they will soon compete with bundles from the platforms they rely on to reach their consumers, Amazon l, Roku, Samsung etc. This will hurt their growth. 

Yeah not for me."

It doesn't have the same branding/recognition as YTTV, Hulu or even Sling.  I see no reason to use it over YTTV and even cable packages are getting cheaper and competitive at these prices.  YTTV has doubled it price but its still the same price currently as Fubo so that's an odd comment.  I've used them all and Fubo is fine but nothing special.  At this point I'm seriously considering going back to spectrum for $45 a month and no contract so I can watch my local teams."

people be paying 60$ for one ufc card lol"
04/01/2021,stocks,"DKNG primarily.  Maybe PENN. Fox owns something in this space and also has ties to programming. 

It’s not as simple as saying they are “early growth,” their core business, the vMVPD space is severely flawed. They will not make money that way so they need ads and gambling to pay off huge. Gambling still needs to solve the signal delay and prove that there is a market vs people using their phones. 

They pay for content (a lot), app development/hosting, distribution, customer acquisition, sales and marketing, etc. 

Remember that Fubo needs Amazon, Roku, Google for distribution or they’re dead and so they have to pay them ~30% (either in rev share tied to subscribers, in ad inventory, or on device promotion).  Those companies will all be competitors at some point with their own bundles (Google already). 

Proceed with caution my friend."

04/01/2021,stocks,"I had high hopes for Fubo. Subscribed for several months during football season. No NFL Redzone, had blacked out regional college basketball games... it was sort of advertised, at the time, as great for sports. I didn’t like it really, not a great platform. PlayStation VUE was the tits, Fubu buys that platform or integrates to something more similar and it would be great."

But ARKK is not leveraged that way, they don’t have a large debt to default on, they just own stocks bought by investor money, so for them to go bankrupt, each and every company they picked has to go bankrupt at the same time which is impossible and in that extremely unlikely case your value would just go to 0 on the fund in question."

 The only risk I see here is if Cathy is wrong about Tesla and the bubble that some analysts see in this stock bursts. As they are 10% into Tesla (ARKK) this will hit the ETF hard and will force many holders to sell. So maybe this generates a downtrend they are not able to stop anymore (but I don't think there is a high risk this will happen)."

No, not heparin like side effects.  Heparin is a blood thinner.  However, in rare cases heparin (and other drugs) can trigger the immune system to attack platelets (the stuff in your blood that clots).

If you bounce into the ER here, yea...  fast blood work to include a blood count, platelets and a DDimer, fast tracked to a CT scan, and a hematology consult if the tests pop.  

Because of the risk of a double whammy, where heparin would also provoke a bigger immune response, heparin is avoided and we’ll go with an anti-Xa pill like: rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban.  If it’s looking bad, probably IV immunoglobulin.  Depending on the CT, what clots were where, interventional neurology could be called in to cath your brain.  Like a cardiac cath...  just a smidge trickier.

Currently, we’re having way more people die of covid than the very rare, bad side effect which is treatable.  They’re looking into if it’s a genetic predisposition, a temperature change during shipping,...  all that.

2021-04-01 05:48:55,stocks,"$MP Materials - A rare, rare earth company bringing sustainable production back to the US Thought I'd take a chance to provide some information on a stock that I have liked for a while, MP Materials.  Right now it is sitting at a low point for a while and I think the time is ripe for the pickens.  Why do I think this right now?

Well MP sits at a mining site in the middle of the desert out near the Cali-Nevada border.  [They sit just south of Las Vegas](https://www.google.com/maps/search/mp+materials/@35.4652108,-115.5387785,17915m/data=!3m1!1e3) right next to a highway for easy transport of the extracted and purified materials as they both mine and refine the ore. 

Well let's start with what they do: rare earth materials mining.  Not the sexiest job on the planet, but it is necessary for all things tech.  Rare earths are a key component of clean energy, IT, defense, industrial applications, and neat little magnets.  Right now, the vast majority of rare earths are produced by China at 80%, leaving a huge vulnerability in a high sought after market.  The market isn't going away but China could pull it's supply.

The US-China relations are at a pretty fragile point.  [NASA has even called Taiwan a country](https://www.newsweek.com/unforgivable-china-furious-nasa-calling-taiwan-country-1580084) which is a hugely sensitive issue.   The current administration seeks to counter Chinese competition and upend their dominance and has been [reviewing the reliance on China for rare earths](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-semiconductors-biden-order/biden-to-order-review-of-u-s-reliance-on-overseas-supply-chains-for-semiconductors-rare-earths-cnbc-idUSKBN2AI2HJ).  

[The price of rare earths is rising, and it caused a jump in the stock price earlier in the month](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mp-materials-quarterly-profit-jumps-on-rising-rare-earths-prices-2021-03-18) - the soaring need for electric vehicles should continue to push it further.  Though the stock price jumped, it did plummet on news that they were [issuing some additional shares, about 10%, to fund new green energy initiatives.](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2021/MP-Materials-Announces-Pricing-of-600-Million-Green-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Offering/default.aspx).  With a larger focus on environmentally friendly projects, it makes $MP a prime target for eco-conscious investors.  

In my opinion, the price dive spooked a large amount of investors sending it way below it's fair value.  10% dilution rocked it to a 30% price dive that it is coming back from strongly now.  Even with the dilution included, the price should pop back up another 20% or so as the market in growth stock picks back up.  $MP doubled the analyst estimates for EPS in Q4 last year and don't look to be slowing down.  [Looking ahead, the forward looking EPS estimates put it at close to $2 for a 15 p/e ratio](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MP/earnings-estimates) with $0.48 EPS in the 4th quarter of 2021.  MP materials hasn't been around long, taking over the site from failed Molycorp, but appear to be hitting it at a good time.  Now not only are they expected to be profitable quickly, but also have the new $584m in cash to ramp up and clean up their operation to ensure a sustainable and competitive supplier of rare earths.

[If you look at their earnings presentation](https://s25.q4cdn.com/570172628/files/doc_presentations/2021/MP-4Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-(3)-3.18.2021.pdf), the story keeps getting better though.  They had 100% YoY revenue growth and are still reducing the cost of production.  Modest for Q4 YoY, but 25% for the entire year.  

I am long MP, with a few hundred shares and a 4/16 $45c.  I like the potential of such a young company that is already pulling a profit in a growing market with a sustainable business model.  Somehow this is a growth stock that has a profitable business model, seems like a safe bet to me - though this isn't financial advise, this is just my own opinion."

There are still some huge hurdles to climb. The main one being building the infrastructure to process the REE on site at mountain pass. These facilities are in the works but will take time. Till then they are still at the mercy of China.

Now, am I saying MP is the next AMZN? No. Of course not. AMZNs and AAPLs and all the rest are rare. But the principle is still the same: if you believe in the company’s trajectory, if you can be patient, and if you haven’t put your financial health at risk to invest in it (e.g., leverage, etc.), then it’s not so bad to pay up for the growth now, like you may have done with AMZN. 

MP has some hurdles—reliance on Shenghe and China, need to complete Phases II and III  to recognize full revenue potential—but it also has a lot of tailwinds lining up for it. Covid taught us that we can’t rely on China for this stuff, and that we need to have domestic capacity. It’s a national security issue now. EV is expanding. And so on. At about 300 p/e, it is expensive. But it may look cheap in the next 5 years."

>The Defense Department awarded MP Materials contracts to fund processing and separation of rare earths, putting it on track to become the only U.S. company capable of doing so.

So, rare earth metals are extremely valuable, and the US is trying to become more independent in this industry, and MP is the only company in the US capable of processing them right now, and they just landed military contracts, and Biden seems to be resisting the idea of more mining in the US. That seems like there's some stars aligning, I think Ima have to buy in this orion.

My background is in medical science, and I have learned (sometimes the hard way), that evidence is king. Even in the face of 'gut feeling' and an affirmation 'making sense', the conclusions drawn are often wrong. It is not until large, well-designed trials are performed that we really know if something is true.

That brings me to the title of my post. I have become very intrigued about investing in recent months-years, and I have read countless opinions about, and explanations of, different forms of analysis, methods of investing, etc. However, what I consistently find missing is citations to the actual evidence behind these ideas and principles. And so here I am, appealing to the kind folks of /r/stocks.

What is the actual evidence behind things like Fundamental and Technical analysis? Have large datasets been collected, studied, and published, showing statistically significant associations between stock-related variables and their ""outcomes""?

So there’s going to be a degree of subjectivity and faith. Fundamental analysis, however, will at least give you a baseline for making educated guesses. 

Technical analysis is very much voodoo to me, but a case can be made that it’s a decent proxy for measuring sentiment and human behavior, and as such, is valuable because it provides some indication of where the herd is heading."

Emotions and FOMO are what cost people money in the stock market. Keep an eye on your portfolio regularly and actually understand what the companies do(or should do in a few years)

You dont need to be a genius, investing has been proven to be more beneficial than saving once the investor truly believes in the companies, and has facts and past performances to back up the belief.

Look at the SANDP500. For 5 ,10, 20 years. Does it dip? Yes. But does it eventually always hit new heights? Yes. If you have time on your side investing is what you should be doing. If its money you will need over the next 12-24 months dont invest.


Do your research and study the market. Look into growth stocks, dividend stocks, value stocks, pick what kind of ""bet"" best suits your risk tolerance.

Heres the thing. If you invested in January in a lot of tech, youd probably be down today. If you looked at your balance say 2 weeks ago, youd probably be down about 25-30 percent from the january all time highs. An emotional investor would see a 30 percent loss, and say ""time to sell before I lose 50 percent"". However a seasoned experienced investor would say ""Stocks are on sale let's load up"" the last two trading days have basically made up the losses dealt in march. You cant be emotional, you need patience and time. And you need some knowledge as to what the companies do and what they CAN do. 

Not financial advice. Write back to me any questions."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I think part of it is that you’re used to hard science where variables can be controlled or measured/accounted for. You won’t find many studies like the ones you’re looking for. Each business case is so unique and there are so many variables at work (none of which are controllable/ replicable). There are no studies because there are no hard rules, and there aren’t any hard rules because no two companies are the same. What we have a lot of are case studies, which are a form of evidence. Aside from extremely basic rules, you cannot generalize what happened in one situation to others. It would be like looking at a the biology of a flower and trying to apply that knowledge fix a fractured skull. 

The closest thing I’ve seen is when some savant recognizes a pattern that has occurred 19 of the last 20 years. Part of it is because people are learning new ways to run businesses all the time. It is always adapting to itself in more ways than the human body is capable of. A new technology can suddenly completely change how a certain business runs (Amazon/Netflix). The human body can adapt and change but nothing compared to what Netflix did to blockbuster. 

Think retrospectively. There was no science that could have predicted apple, tesla, google, Enron, Facebook or Netflix. That’s part of why the market works the way it does. It’s kinda like Schrodinger‘s cat where the company is both worthless and priceless until time passes and a result materializes. 

Sometimes the market sentiment towards a stock is unjustifiably negative for a long time until they pass some milestone that changes the markets opinion. The opposite happens too. That’s where the most money is to be made and lost. Sometimes a stock is putting out great/terrible earnings but the market just doesn’t care until a certain point.

All we really have is general rules and different ways to analyze a company. If you want to compare it to medicine, compare it to neurology. Not a lot of generalizable rules, individual/social psychology must be considered, and it is only half understood, at best. Also, can’t ever really be certain, but the more information you get, the more you’ll see the situation in its entirety and hopefully with that comes an understanding of what to do."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Read about Modern Portfolio Theory (for free online). This is the core of what every institutional portfolio manager (endowment, pension, insurance company) uses to construct their portfolio. 

TLDR version - no one can beat the average over the long term, therefore buy an index for beta exposure. Then find non/low-correlated assets with positive long term returns (bonds mainly, real estate, maybe gold) to diversify and provide a lower risk, higher returning portfolio. Hold. Rebalance annually or when markets go haywire (stocks dump like last year)."
04/01/2021,stocks,that’s thing we never can say anything is definitely true and that’s why basically all finance is theory.the issue is there are endless lists of always changing variables and impossible to hold variables constant while changing one to actually indefinitely prove theories
04/01/2021,stocks,"Technical analysis is almost 100% BS and essentially the same as astrology. It's about predicting the future based on the past and, while that might seem logical, the market can change on a dime because what matters is what people think about the future, the past is 100% irrelevant(One can't make money off the past value of the stock, on the future). 

Fundamental analysis is necessary for long term investing.

Psychological analysis is necessary for growth. This analysis, I just made of the term, is learning to read politics and psychology of people. The market or a stock can change on a dime if some politician farts wrong even if has nothing to do with the stock.  People generally are illogical/irrational.

You cannot use the past of a stock to predict it's future value. It's that simple. Yes, there may be some short term or cyclical correlations BUT they are so minor that a human cannot detect them(algorithms can to profit by pennies which add up by volume) in any way to actually predictably profit.

Psychological analysis is short term profit. Fundamental analysis is long term(but can play in to short term too). But like all things in life the more you know about everything the better. 

Basically NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE will teach you how to make money in the markets. Anyone pitching you any shit about how to make money is a liar or moron. If they had a viable method they wouldn't be telling you about it... they would just use it to profit.

You learn as much as you can and you go gamble, because the stock market is a casino. Given how much manipulation and fraud exists in it(which you should do your research before investing lots of money) it's almost pointless to invest anything but long term... except in rare black swan events when it is easy to predict what will happen. (e.g., if the market tanks you know that it will almost surely go back up).

Most people that make serious money in the markets consistently are ones that manipulate it or learn to profit off the manipulators by either following along(essentially work with), anticipating them, or anticipating the effects they create.

If you ever learn to make money then you will have learned and it would be that, but as someone that doesn't know how the only answer is that there is no way. You decide if you want to go down this path of gambling your money for a living or investing long term and knowing enough to do basic FA and you do it and hopefully do not lose too much in the process of learning to minimize risk.

The stock market isn't your friend, it is made up of millions upon millions of other people trying to rape you and you have to learn to rape them first or you are screwed."
04/01/2021,stocks,">evidence is king. 

the overwhelming evidence tends to support fundamental analysis as useful (particularly some form of value investing,or buying assets for below their intrinsic value). the overwhelming evidence tends to go against technical analysis, apart from perhaps a few narrow circumstances. 

several Nobel prizes have been awarded for discoveries related to fundamental analysis. such as the Eugene Fama-Kenneth French three-factor model which explained why certain stocks tend to out-perform over time. the fact that small and value stocks tend to outperform had been known for decades, the company Tweedy Browne specialized in these stocks from the 1930s. but Fama and French explained why. 

in fact, one of the best research compilations was put together by Tweedy Brown. https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/sites/valueinvesting/files/files/what_has_worked_all.pdf

investor Joel Greenblatt developed a value investing theory he called the ""magic investing formula"" (selecting stocks with high earnings yield and high return on capital). this theory has robust support for being effective from stock markets around the world. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_formula_investing"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Fundamentals are a good start but get screwed over time because things change/new information comes out, just keep and eye out for changes in the company and news that affects the industry and reposition. Also helps to know what kind of people are running the company.

TA can work but keep in mind it's probability based and depends on the timeframe and it works until it doesn't. MACD, Death Cross, RSI, and Trade Volume are going to be your best friends if you go this route. If you do a combination of Fundamental and TA it's good for morale/confirmation bias when you're unsure about a position. 

There's a 3rd method which is just to keep track of supply/demand of stocks, keeping an eye out for short squeezes, share buybacks/offerings, unnaturally high volume trades, mergers and acquisitions, etc. High supply low demand means prices go down, low supply high demand means prices go up. This is mostly short term trades and can work well with TA. 

Keeping track of all 3 is like a full time job though. To cut the workload helps to pick a handful of stocks in an industry you're familiar with and try your best.

As an aside, I suck at all 3 of these."

It tells you how the company is performing. it's growth, it's balance sheet, vs industry etc. a company can be doing good but that doesn't reflect on the price of the stock. alternatively a company can be losing money and the stock can be ripping - best example of this is Tesla. 


you guys have no idea what FA IS let alone TA as it refer to a stock and price movements - which at the end of the day is what counts."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Modern portfolio theory is classical but not all that modern. For starters, market returns are not Gaussian and risk is not correctly measured by symmetric probability distributions; moreover things are not static. It is well accepted that MPT is only a convenient simplification, but it is not sufficient for deeper risk-return analysis. There is a reason why all hedge funds and proprietary trading houses have quant units. See:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertemporal\_CAPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertemporal_CAPM)

Notice that most regressions in classical portfolio theories are assumed to be linear, which often is unrealistic in practice. Markets tend to be quite nonlinear in real life."
04/01/2021,stocks,"If you assume that there is any measure of long term probabilistic determinism in markets (which fundamental analysis and most financial theory does assume, for example though the idea of ""reversion to the mean"") then it should be possible to statistically predict something about the future from the past.

Hence any claim that TA is BS *on first principles* does not hold water. One can certainly criticize classical TA (as developed in the early 20th century) as non-scientific or proto-scientific, but one can't seriously claim that past data does not contain *any* information about the future.

If you do state so then you are claiming that markets are *entirely* random, which nobody truly believes. The basic idea of all financial mathematics is that markets can be modeled by probabilistically deterministic processes, i.e. there are hidden (though poorly understood and very complex) patterns which govern their sufficiently long term statistics. This is also the fundamental belief behind any rational economics theory of markets, otherwise markets could not play any useful ""price discovery"" function.

The conflict of perspective between investors and traders is that the former try to avoid market fluctuations (volatility) by using time to their advantage, while the later try to profit from short time trends. Since the latter have more randomness, it is much harder to be a successful trader than a successful investor (and this is borne out by statistical evidence). However this does *not* mean that successful traders do not exist at all or that everything that traders think is complete nonsense."

As for why his portfolio skews Canadian, he's stated before that that is because of tax ramifications.

As for the rest, this is complete conjecture but when he recommends total market index funds he often says that he recommends them for ""99% of investors"" my guess is that his firm and fund are there to help the 1% of investors for which index funds are not optimal."
04/01/2021,stocks,"There's vast academic literature on factors that are statistically correlated with exceptional stock market returns (beyond macro-economic factors, among the best studied are value, market cap, momentum and efficiency of investment).

For technical analysis (TA) things are more shaky because the data set is limited (there's an issue of reproducibility) but there are strategies that have been shown to produce positive returns when tested on historical data; the returns of course tend to disappear quite fast once those strategies become publicly known. This tends to go quite a bit beyond the early 20th century classical TA used by most traditional traders (take a look at r/algotrading for more info).

The modern version of ""TA"" is quite complex in that it uses pretty advanced probabilistic models -- and it is usually combined with fundamental and macro analysis. Various methods of this kind are used by quantitative trading outfits, generally applied to or combined with analysis of various derivative instruments."

If you don't mind sharing, what data do you follow in this regard?"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Regarding P/E ratio, we do have evidence that companies with a lower P/E ratio tend to give higher long term returns but it comes with the trade off of higher risk. This is called the Value Risk Premium. Check out the Fama-French three factor model, it seeks to explain the differences in returns between equally diversified portfolios."
04/01/2021,stocks,"It depends on the sector. I wouldn't compare just any stock another they have to be in the same industry . Think of it this way if walmart has a p/r of 15 and target a p/e of 17 but costco has a p/e of 30 that could mean two things, one that the market is expecting costco to have higher growth than the other two. Or that costco is overvalued meaning that it will have worse long term returns. I like to think about it this way, the higher the price of an asset is bid up in the short term the lower the long terms returns will be. That is how you would judge a p/e ratio in its most fundamental terms. Problem is that the market is not always rational and in fact normally irrational. So to answer your original question to my knowledge no, I don't know of a study that judged p/e ratios and stock increases. But a p/e ratio is a fundamental analysis tool it is not a predictor of future stock price, why? Because the market is normally irrational. Just because a company has a great valuation dosnt mean the market will always buy it for a number of reasons and l/e is only one ratio, to properly value a company you need to use far more tools and ratios and metrics."

04/01/2021,stocks,"That’s why every institutional portfolio manager has an allocation to hedge funds. Unfortunately, hedge funds have been the biggest disappointment for institutions over the last decade. Their track record is spotty at best and rarely offer outperformance consistently. And good luck trying to replicate that exposure as a retail investor."
04/01/2021,stocks,"It is not that TA is 100% BS, it is that traditional TA that is taught as a science using predictor patterns is BS, which is what generally people call TA.

You can predict all things from the past. The universe is just a recursively evolving ""machine"". The past completely defines the future... assuming you know everything(which doesn't contradict QM, QM just says you can't know everything).

1. They have done studies with TA's, given them a randomly generated chart and the TA's have ""predicted"" the stock price(or not). That is, they couldn't even tell it was not random.

2. TA's errors ignored. When they get it wrong they ignore their failures and when they get it right it confirms to them that TA is valid. This just creates an irrational person. 

There are clearly patterns and trends. These are not TA. Most people that look at charts will see such patterns. These are localized patterns that occur due to specific causation's. These patterns can be used as predictors to some degree, but not perfectly. But one cannot use any of the TA's patterns(head and shoulders, cups, etc) because they are too long term.  Yes, sometimes they might be correct because they might model real world causation but if they are not right or wrong more than 50% of the time then they are useless.

3. The real proof that TA is bullshit is that if it wasn't then people that used it would make a killing. Now, in fact, maybe there are some people that use TA and make consistent profit, but they are not using TA as was know it.

Astrology, for example, is BS, but there is truth to it. If you could know every aspect of the universe then you could predict everything that comes afterwards. But can astrologists even come close to predicting such things.

I think people should familiarize themselves with TA because charts are not totally random(e.g., It's not just a random positive real value) and one can get a ""feel"" and integrate what is happening with a chart with other aspects. Clearly a chart is data and it says something. For me ""chart reading"" and ""technical analysis"" are different things.  Technical analysis tries to extract very strong predictive patterns from what is essentially random data(for all practical purposes for most humans).

For example, take a chart and scale it and have a TA look at it without knowing the scale, they will find some pattern in the chart that matches what they have learned and then cite what it is suppose to predict. Now clearly, you realize that if the scale is over months or years there is no way in hell the prediction will be correct except by coincidence? This is the effect of chaos. The world is chaotic and the time scale actually matters yet they do not include in to their analysis.

TA is astrology. Astrology gave birth to astronomy when people actually applied the scientific method. It may be there is something more meaningful in TA but for 98% of people TA is simply BS. They can learn a little about it but it will only hurt their abilities to profit. You definitely do not want beginners to learn it. It only will harm them by potentially brainwashing them.

Now, having said that, TA becomes self-fulfilling. If most traders use TA then they create the patterns they are looking for, and in that sense it becomes non-random. One could make money by recognizing this but I'm not sure what the profit margin is since it depends on what ""most"" actually is.

TA may evolve over time to become more scientific, but at this point it probably is not effective enough to increase profits to any useful degree and could cause substantial losses."

you could look at whatever historical data is available - their blood pressures in the past, vital signs of other people their age.  you could look at their overall health, and their predicted health in the future.  maybe they're a smoker and you think that that will lead to higher blood pressure in the future.  

but ultimately, no one knows the future.  maybe they quit smoking and their blood pressure stays healthy.  maybe they start a high stress job and their blood pressure spikes.  maybe they die in a car crash and their blood pressure drops to zero (bankruptcy).  it's impossible to say for sure.  but we can still make intelligent predictions based off of the information that we do have."

Again, I'm not saying chart reading is useless, just TA. Maybe there are a few who have somehow integrated a modified TA in such a way it gives them several percentage points extra. That is significant, unlikely but there is a chance. 

TA is too dependent on ""randomness"" itself. They will base their patterns and lines off essentially noise around the data. One would expect TA to actually use an average but they don't. Basically there methods are too susceptable to noise.

Maybe when one has enough of the main tools down and can make money with them TA can be useful because it can be coordinated in a more intuitive sense of the stock, but unless TA's can actually prove they can make money using it, it's just numerology and a scam.

There still might be problems and some buyers get burned but we wouldn't have HF's who's sole purpose is to undermine humanity for a buck. Ultimately the issue is money itself as where there is money(wealth) there will be some humans willing to do anything to amass it(addition). So wealth caps have to be in place."
04/01/2021,stocks,Shoot! Thanks anyhow! I'll report back if I find anything.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the laugh. Nope, I haven't. I was tempted at some point to sell them overpriced call options (as some friends did) but my better self prevailed over my evil twin."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I agree on the principles. The question is how to make sure that the market is sufficiently transparent (and investors sufficiently empowered) to achieve this in practice.

As we saw with Enron, one can't even rely on the best auditing firms to do a proper job of rooting out corporate misreporting, so it's not trivial to go from here to there. Many investors don't have the time to dig deeply enough into 10-Qs and 10-Ks to detect the wonders that creative accounting can produce."
04/01/2021,stocks,"You can start with the French-Fama model, one of the oldest models of this type: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama%E2%80%93French\_three-factor\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama%E2%80%93French_three-factor_model)

It is a simple example of [multi-factor model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multifactor-model.asp).

More modern approaches use non-Gaussian probability distributions to model stock market returns, this is part of the mathematical theory of stochastic processes."
04/01/2021,stocks,Please do! I’m curious now as well!
04/01/2021,stocks,"I don't think one can ensure it. One has to except that there are psychopaths out there that are working tirelessly to undermine finance and society and multiply themselves.

All one can do is make it so difficult(rather than easy) for them that it takes 10000 years for them to get anywhere that it now takes them 10 years.

Full transparency and accountability are 100% necessary. The psychopaths will push claims that privacy is needed... think about it, is privacy really needed? Privacy is only for hiding stuff, and clearly 99% of the damage done to humanity the crooks able to hide.

No one cares if you buy a dildo on amazon or if you have 353$ in your bank account, etc. Yes, in some cases it could be embarrassing but that would go away when transparency is normalized. Yes, some times that info could be used by crooks to target but one has to setup blocks. Basically if everything is transparency ""user data"" can't be sold or manipulated because it can be on everyone.  People that want to hide shit are people who have something to hide... and those people are the problem.
 
But that is just one small piece of the pie. One must revamp society so that financial theft is the worst crime(worse than murder because it leads to murder. Happy people do not kill. The #1 thing that makes people unhappy is lack of wealth/success). One must implement a UBI so there is always a safety net. One must properly educate people and children. One must keep people engaged in health/exercise.  And lots of other things.

It's extremely difficult to fix all the problems, impossible actually. But the idea is to work on the biggest issues first and go from there and have a system that can grow and adapt. Ultimately the psychology of man has to change from individual to social(we are in that transition and it will take a long time but it must be supported because we are no longer individuals(too connected)).

The idea here is that humanity has to define what it wants(not what a few corrupt rich people want) and start transforming to get there. All this is easy to say, very hard to make it work. Essentially it is happening though. I think the financial side is the biggest issue since $$$ is effectively water($$$ is a cancer that has so metastasized that it's in every aspect of human life, now it has integrated it and must be made part of because it can't be removed). The rich hoard wealth, that has to change. There has to be some type of wealth cap and resistance to making more and more and more rather than the opposite(the more one has the easier it is to make more). The reason is that wealth is social(wealth doesn't exist on the individual level(e.g., think of only human in the universe)). Our current society is mainly individualistic... and so wealth is accumulated in to some individuals but this then hurts society as a whole and hence other individuals.

Education is the number one issue but that is a much easier problem to solve. A UBI with requirements is the way to go. The governments need to use the UBI to shape people(in the right way) to get them to do things that are proven to make society better... and society will get better because those people will be willing to do the right things for a UBI. (poor people that is, which make of 95% of the population)

Of course the old faulty structures of the past have to be removed/transformed and in a way that it doesn't collapse humanity. I think people are working on this, lots of people, and things will eventually get better or we will have a collapse that sets humanity back 100's of years. People need to realize how $$$ shapes humans cause without that knowledge we will repeat the same insane shit that we are currently going through(and have been for millennia).

Essentially the psychological problems that are innate in being a human have to be ""evolved"" out by setting up systems that do not amplify those psychological problems. What has happened is that the systems that were designed were either oblivious or conducive to the psychological issues of humans and essentially act as amplifies of them. It's like building positive void coefficient nuclear reactors. It was a mistake to do them, a mistake from ignorance. We learn from our mistakes, generally, and build better things. That is what has to happen with humanity, but the mistakes we made, overall, were that of ignoring the psychotic nature of the human mind. It may be that we shouldn't try to remove such things but learn to harness it in a positive way(it may be that the human mind becomes psychotic when shaped in certain ways and our societies(say $$$) have been shaping them in precisely way that make it psychotic or it may be that there is some flaw in the human mind that is ""exploited"" and amplified that makes it psychotic).

The main thing here is that our ""leaders"" must recognize psychopathy is a huge problem in humanity and even with themselves and we must design systems that do not amplify it, and hence monitor the systems for psychopathy. (We see a ton of it in today's world and the systems that create it do nothing to actually fix it so psychopathy just grows and grows and grows). Essentially the populace is a reflection of the leaders. If the leaders are insane, so is the populace. If the leaders are ignorance, so is the populace."

04/01/2021,stocks,I’ve only been investing for about a year and a half. When I first started I would check it nonstop throughout the day. In the last 2-3 months I check it maybe once a day sometimes only a couple times a week. Not sure what changed I think it’s just over time I got less and less worried about the day to day changes
04/01/2021,stocks,delete the app off your phone for awhile
04/01/2021,stocks,Could make it so you have to login every time you want to view your stocks? The extra 30 seconds of typing in your passcode/2 factor authentication becomes old quickly and will put you off checking them so much - atleast that worked for me when I was spending all day every day just staring at my stocks instead of actually working
04/01/2021,stocks,For me I've noticed a lot of activity happens in last hour of trading day. So I check how pre market and early trading looks to see what type of day it will be and recheck on it at end of day when power hour is over. Checking in middle of day doesn't give good.info.
04/01/2021,stocks,"It’s that dopamine hit from seeing even the smallest amount of green lol. I check way less often when my shit is tanking. 

You’ve come to terms with it becoming a problem, now set a rule that you can only check it at certain times. If you can’t have the self control to only check two to three times(while I’m eating breakfast, lunch and once after market closes is when I check) then it’s a more serious compulsion and I would delete the app. 

It’s something I’m working on right now too. I definitely find it easy to distract from my work"
04/01/2021,stocks,I'm guessing you're new. Give it some time and you will naturally become less worried about your portfolio
04/01/2021,stocks,"Move to Asia/overseas. You have maybe an hour or two as the market opens and then you go to sleep, wake up, and market is closed.

Set limits on your phone that you can check or remove notifications so your phone from everything but phone/messages so it doesn't train you to pick it up every 10 seconds, read a book, have a lot of red days where you are scared to see how much you lost.

There are lots of ways!"
04/01/2021,stocks,"I mean it is totally normal to check your account everyday, but the key thing is that don’t budge when your account is down. When you about to sell a stock, think about why you bought it in the first place."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I go through waves of this constant checking as well..It’s very distracting and exhausting and it’s exactly why I got out of stocks that require minute to minute attention, like GME. It’s kinda the same as constantly checking social media apps for that quick dopamine kick and rush. And unfortunately the only way to stop it is to stop looking and break the cycle. The habit will fade away with time. 

Also, something concrete that might help - if you have an iPhone, you can add a stock ticker for a specific symbol to your iphone home screen. I have one for TSLA and I find it really helpful. It keeps me updated but only with a quick glance. Plus, Apple gives good news articles on the stock too which helps give perspective on why the price went up or down that day."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I set my phone screen to never power off, and i just leave my brokerage app up all day. I steal glances constantly, but I'm making small moves maybe a few times a month tops. 

Mainly, I'm interested in watching how my holdings move in relation to each other and the rest of the market. I get cranky when I'm down 10 or 20 thousand in a day, but the only time I lost focus on work and had to tend to my holdings was the day RKT spiked and I closed at 41. 

Not sure what my point is here. Maybe to watch for the sake of learning, not the sake of micromanaging every second of the week?"
04/01/2021,stocks,I tell myself it's better than drinking.
04/01/2021,stocks,Practice self control? If you know you want to hold long term then quit thinking about what might happen to them. Delete the app from your phone and only pull it up on your PC at home if you have to but cmon it’s not that hard.

04/01/2021,stocks,"If you’re checking your stocks all the time, you’ve put too much money in. You need to be prepared to lose it all, and if you’re not - you’re risking too much and you should take your money out. That’s how you don’t check it all the time, you can afford to forget about it"
04/01/2021,stocks,I got a notification for this post and it made me want to check my account 🤣
04/01/2021,stocks,"Keep yourself busy! I had the same issue, but realised that the time spent looking at my positions is wasted, generally. I just stare at them for minutes again and again and waste my time. I also realised that watching them makes me prone to make impulsive decisions, which could mess up my long-term strategy or lose me money for no good reason. Once I realised that, I just had to remind myself of it every time that I wanted to look at my portfolio. Is there a specific reason why I want to check it? If so, I do it. Am I just opening it to see what's going on because I'm bored? I don't do it.

At the end of the day, it's about discipline and realising that there are better ways to spend your time. Plus, the more often you watch your positions, the more likely you are to get stressed which in turn may even affect your health! More stress, more cortisol, more stress eating, more negative emotions, etc. If you have done the necessary research, you shouldn't worry. If you haven't, then spend time doing that research instead of simply checking your positions again and again and again.

I forced myself to stop checking my portfolio for a week. Once I did that, I felt a bit more detached from it (which is really the reason why you check it all the time - you're too emotionally involved) and it became easier to check it less and less.

I'd recommend just avoiding watching it for a week. Try it and see how you get on. Worst case scenario, get an app like App Detox and set yourself a daily allowance of 5 mins every day."

04/01/2021,stocks,"I think some people are just wired differently. I’m 20, I started investing a couple months before the pandemic and I’ve never had the urge to constantly check my portfolio. I really genuinely don’t care if my entire portfolio tanks 5% tomorrow, I would probably almost be happier if it did because of the buying opportunity it would create in my highest conviction stocks. Who cares if they dip 5% this day, this month or this year if I have a very high conviction that they’ll double or triple in the next few years."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Well for one, 6 years is not a long term investing timeline, so if this money can negatively affect your life in 6 years you probably shouldn't be invested in equities.

04/01/2021,stocks,"I have this same issue. What I have done is open a new account to play with to keep my active mind occupied, while the other accounts are on “set it and forget it” mode. I do add up all my accounts every week so I can see if I moved forward or backwards for the week - and I keep a record of it. I have every weeks balances going back 3 years now."

04/01/2021,stocks,"I found that setting alerts helps me the most. I'll set alerts that will indicate an interesting price movement both up and down, and if I don't see an alert, I'll just know I don't have any changes interesting enough to look. TOS is the most reliable one for alerts.

Another thing which might be kind of cheating in the spirit of the question is I have a widget on my home screen with 9 of my most important positions showing. I don't really need to look in jy account because I can see things in my home screen. Sometimes I'll log in anyway to a the total (especially if things are going up), but it certainly cuts it back."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Time. It's literally addicting at first, especially if you hopped in during the Covid crash/recovery.

04/01/2021,stocks,"I check every hour. Is that excessive? Anyway. How about check three or five times a day? Understanding that the stock is open on the weekday from 8:30 am to 3:00 pm, you can come up with a mathematical schedule that fits for you. Like spending only five to fifteen minutes checking your stocks very hour to two hour. Make a schedule that works for you."
04/01/2021,stocks,Once you realize that small market changes dont have any real affect on the bigger long term goal you will stop looking constantly.

I still look every day since I want to buy more shares if some of my mid-term specs dip a bit, be able to average down and all that. But I’m hardly paying attention to my long term shares/etfs. It’s exciting at first but gets pretty repetitive after a while."

2021-04-01 04:07:05,stocks,"$ARVL price action I have been watching $ARVL for a long time now. Today's price action is a little confusing to me. Anyone know whats going on?

(1) Price didnt budge for months as CIIC

(2) 3 weeks ago, it hit a low around $18 and never saw that price again....until merger

(3) Today, its as low as 15.88 (while everything else is up including ACTC)

What am I missing here? Isnt it oversold? Is this PIPE selling off?

What does this mean for other SPACS that are deemed to be solid like IPOE or CMLF? Should I shave the top off in preparation for the merger date when its going to drop $3-$5?

is this going to be like NVVE and AEVA?   In both cases, I was able to shave the top off with the pop on the date of change.   Then both plummeted to $10-$11.   Is this going to be the norm now for everything?  What's the point of even holding shares?   You aren't going to be rewarded for holding through merger."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I feel like some people bought this as CIIC because they wanted a short term gain. Probably the reason for the dip after the merger - people expected a sharp rise in share price but it was likely overbought based on hype.

It's not a short term play imo. Hold this for years. It's going to take a while to see which EV companies make it and which don't.

Remember this company doesn't have a sellable product yet, they are still testing, it remains to be seen how they will handle production and scaling, so it's a risky play. 

Likely it will trade sideways for a while, unless some positive news comes out such as a large order, or positive news from the real-world testing that's about to take place here in the UK in the summer.

I've been holding shares for a while now, and will hold them for years, possibly decades depending on how it goes. I like the company and management, I think their micro factory approach is clever."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I’d like to know as well, I bought the dip but it keeps dipping... my theory was that the Biden Infra-plan is going to give a leg up for establishment auto to get up to speed ...leaving the new names vulnerable."
04/01/2021,stocks,"There has been a general lack of continued enthusiasm in EVs in general lately.  So many names it's hard to keep track of all of them.

If you believe in this story, wait for it to play out.

I don't know much about this company other than an order from UPS who is also working with another EV startup Workhorse.

It needs some positive news, like landing a big bus order, otherwise this might trade below $10 until they can start delivering vehicles and becoming cash flow positive.

There is a typical lull in mining stocks between the date the funding is secured (some excitement around how much money will be made in two years when they go into production), and when they actually get into production.  Perhaps the same will be said of EV startups, although they may have the interim benefit of exciting presales figures, and you can't predict when a large order will hit the books.

If you're convinced on their product and value proposition, it shouldn't be hard for them to land that next big contract, but that might be tomorrow or 6 months from now, you never know.

I'm not invested in this one, but wish you luck!"

If you believe in the story, as they get through validation and have more data points to share with potential customers, the orders should follow.

I don't think Hyundai/Kia would buy them at this valuation, otherwise they would not have needed to go the SPAC route, but a deal is not completely off the table.  GOEV recently cut ties with them."

04/01/2021,stocks,"etrade and td ameritrade often have no shares to lend.

a while back when people were shorting GME, etrade and TDA had nothing."
04/01/2021,stocks,You also need a margin account with a certain balance in order to do so. Don't know exact percentages but are you a margin or cash account?
04/01/2021,stocks,"I have an Etrade and Fidelity accounts.   Etrade has poor availability of stocks like WAFU to short.  The don't even let you know until you hit the short button.

On Fidelity they let you know haw many shares are available to short when you enter the symbol.  I've been able to short stock that Etrade did not have availability."
04/01/2021,stocks,"A lot of the mid tier retail-focused brokers won’t let you short things if they’re not commonly used.   Essentially the broker has to pre-borrow the shares in some way before they let you have them short, and if there’s not enough interest they won’t borrow them ahead of time.   For something like AAPL there’s plenty of demand for it so they tend to provide access, but for less common stocks they don’t usually have them.   Instead of running out to find some shares for you to short, they just tell you they’re not available since it’s likely not worth their time.

Of the major brokers I use, IBKR tends to have the best selection for less well known stocks, and if you’re planning on doing large blocks you can ask them to pre-borrow for you if they have none available.   With Tda or fidelity they can often get them but it takes a phone call and a fairly sizeable order.   I don’t use e*trade but they’re reputable and I suspect you could call them and ask for a pre-borrow and they’d have some ability to do this for you if they wanted to, but it may depend on account size and standing.   Either way it’s worth a phone call if you’re otherwise happy with their service.

I don’t usually like to short sell, but sometimes it’s too obvious a play and I can’t help but bite.   I mostly use Ibkr for that after experiencing mixed results with Tda and fidelity."
04/01/2021,stocks,What’s the ticker you want to short? It could legit that the brokers can’t lend anymore shares to short sellers.
04/01/2021,stocks,What makes a ticker blacklisted for this purpose? I haven’t tried to short any of the meme stocks. 😅

04/01/2021,stocks,"I mostly swing trade stocks with good momentum in hot markets or look at leaders in markets that I'll think will be hot a little down the road. I don't bother sitting on stocks for years, especially if they're dogs in my portfolio. I'll cut my losses and free up that cash to put in something that'll actually make money.

All in all, the stock market runs on speculation. If you sit around and wait for ages until the market recognizes that a particular stock is undervalued, then you're just wasting time (unless you don't mind letting cash sit in a stock for potentially years).  And if you're only considering fundamental analysis, then you won't even look at 75% of stocks. 

My advice is to learn some technical analysis. Once you do that, you won't even care what the ticker is."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Timing.  It is all about timing.  

But one thing you will learn quickly, I hope, is that even when you do quite well you can kick yourself because you should have:

1. Bought a little sooner, or maybe later.
2. Sold a little too soon, or maybe too late.

That's when you are doing well.  When you are struggling those things **really** happen.

When trading options especially I never invest more than maybe 20% of my cash at a time.  That gives you room to recover from major mistakes.  Even when investing in shares I try to keep some cash around.  You might need to:

1. Average down (i.e. buy more when you bought too soon)
2. Buy something that suddenly seems like the perfect purchase

My latest mistake is to buy too many things on one day, a quite unremarkable day at that.  Sometimes you get the itch to buy something so you do.  Then later you think, why did I buy right then?  I had no suspicion that the stock was going to jump soon.  It wasn't a particularly remarkable buy that day.  I just was bored and wanted to spend money.

Selling is a bit easier to time right, when making money.  And my latest suggestion is to know how and when you want to use trailing stop loss sell orders.  If I suspect that a stock is reaching a high point, or even simply will climb steadily until it makes a major turn, that is what I use so that I don't even need to keep watching in order to sell at a reasonably decent high point.

As for what to buy. Take your time. Start small.  I don't even want to be responsible for your mistakes there. It's bad enough being responsible for my own."

04/01/2021,stocks,Finding enough money to invest in those stocks.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Being uncomfortable with my portfolio. I have decided to go with a ""philosophy"", that if I make a trade, I have to be comfortable with it. If I buy, I must remain at ease when the stock goes down hard or shoots up. If I sell a stock, I must be comfortable with that stock doing what ever it decides later and not feel regret.

It's a manyfold issue.

1) If I am uncomfortable with my positions, I just feel an unpleasant unease and it is just personally taxing. If I intend to invest for the next 40-50 years, I better not be uncomfortable for that whole time.

2) If I'm uncomfortable, I open myself up to emotional risk. Which means that it is harder to stick to a strategy. I strongly believe that it is better to stick to a sub-optimal strategy, rather than trying to reinvent and improve your strategy every week. Changes can be made, but they must be removed from emotions. And having a strategy and portfolio I am comfortable with massively helps with that.

3) Having a comfortable portfolio helps with future investments. Once I have a small number of trades I am happy with, I can just keep on adding to these positions. I am no longer lost in the thousands of different investment opportunities, trying to think which one is the very best. If something interesting comes up, I can easily compare it to my comfortable positions and evaluate if it would improve it considerably or not. Usually the answer is no."

04/01/2021,stocks,Easy summary
04/01/2021,stocks,"This. The emotions involved behind trades and prices, ups and downs, are the biggest hurdle. Even just sitting in your hands becomes an issue when you actively watch the market: there's this attitude that you need to always be making a move everyday when just going nothing is a viable play for that day. You don't always have to engage with the numbers. Zooming out and focusing on LT is an issue because we can now instantly read or watch when someone else makes it big and think, well if that idiot did it then surely I can too. 

 Not everyone is cut out to individually pick stocks and do the research and not panic when your money goes down. Most people are better off just buying a broad index ETF, and regularly contributing and let time work for you. However the part of you that sees other idiots make money just doesn't want to hear that. Overcoming this emotional response to the stock market is the biggest issue most people face imo."

I mentioned in previous posts that if the squeeze hasn't been squoze by April, then the series is probably over.   


Welcome to April, let's chat.

**Why did I say April?** This play was always a console cycle ER play that turned into something completely unexpected. Past that, there were no significant catalysts in sight to fuel a short squeeze. This was when conditions were favorable to a short squeeze which is no longer the case. So what are we left with? Unfavorable analytics and no catalysts. I'm sure you've already marked me off as a shill working for Citadel, but please read on. 

**Has the Squeeze Been Squoze? Kind of**

**Will the Squeeze Be Squoze? Maybe.**

The GameStop saga has been one of the most interesting things to follow due to its rarity and extreme movements. If you're looking for confirmation bias, move on, if you're looking for analysis strap in.

# Let's first talk about the 10-K

If you haven't had a chance to look through it, [here it is](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638021000032/gme-20210130.htm#i3ad65c8584a445ee94e4314f67ce616c_37).

Red Flag 1: They didn't take questions during the conference call

Red Flag 2: "" In December 2020, we entered into the ATM Program. Sales of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program may be made by means of transactions that are deemed to be an ""at the market offering"" as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act, including block transactions, sales made directly on the NYSE or sales made into any other existing trading markets of our shares of Class A Common Stock. We are under no obligation to offer and sell shares of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program. **As of January 30, 2021, and through the date of this Form 10-K, we have not sold any shares of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program. Since January 2021, we have been evaluating whether to increase the size of the ATM Program and whether to potentially sell shares of our Class A Common Stock under the increased ATM Program during the course of fiscal 2021, primarily to fund the acceleration of our future transformation initiatives**. The timing and amount of sales under the ATM Program would depend on, among other factors, our capital needs and alternative sources and costs of capital available to us, market perceptions about us, and the then current trading price of our Class A Common Stock.""

Who is this a red flag for? People playing the squeeze

Who is this a green flag for? People who are long on GME.

Let's start with being long on GME, I too am bullish on GameStop's future, but there is simply zero DD or analysis that could prove that GameStop is trading anywhere near fair market value at these prices. Without posting a full DD, my initial analysis would price GameStop fairly *right now* at around $40 pricing in some things people consider as upcoming catalysts. I do believe in the longevity of the company and will wait patiently for the prices to come back to earth before loading up. I don't have a multi-year PT without further analysis but I would argue triple digits are likely in the next 1-3 years. 

Now, when I say people who are long on GME, I'm not talking about bulls, I'm talking about people who are positioned really well like u/DeepFuckingValue. 

If GameStop decides to sell shares they could generate billions in cash to fund this digital transformation they are seeking. So it's great for the company outlook, terrible for those who are waiting for a larger squeeze. 

**This is a dangerous move for them.** It is absolutely the most brilliant move they could make financially and would be amazing for a company to be able to just generate billions instantly (this news should make you happy as a long investor), but it could be really bad for their image. GameStop has had so much free marketing due to this event and Ryan Cohen has become a celebrity. This sale of their shares could destroy that image, which right now, the image might be worth more than billions. 

But if the attention span of investors has anything to say, they very well might make this sale and move on. 

**So what happens if they sell shares?** The price plummets and they make a fortune. Again, great news for the company, bad news for diamond hands. 

Right now...I want you to take a moment and think about this. All the catalysts, reports, and numbers you could draw up becoming absolutely meaningless if GameStop decides to start cashing out on their ATM program. No matter what you think could possibly happen, no matter what you have read, if GameStop starts cashing out, the price will absolutely plummet.

That is why this is at the top of the research, because anything else I say beyond this point could be made null and void.

# Let's talk about Part 6

Well, the predictions have been holding up pretty strong...and that's the problem. This has been going on for way too long. This bleed and mass amount of dead cat bounces has just been chipping away at buying power and hope, the bears are in control. 

I was going to come on here and offer my opinion that the squeeze has been squoze and this is now over due to the lack of catalysts. Had the price dropped back to $50 pre-ER we would have seen a third squeeze already. Sadly, the price remained too high and we passed all possible items that could act as a catalyst.

I'm not even going to discuss short interest, it's literally pointless. Of course it's shorted, it's a stock that was trading at over $200 higher than current prices a couple of weeks ago. 

We know it's still shorted right now but those shorts are well ITM. 

We know it will get shorted on the way back down.

# There is a possibility for a third squeeze

It's amazing that all the catalysts people have been waiting for there is a worthy one right in front of us, but we won't acknowledge it because it sounds like its bad news. **If they sell their shares.**

If they decide to start selling shares, the price will plummet. It will get shorted the entire way down, and will settle around 40-50 in my opinion (Do your own DD for PT's).

So what would this mean?

1. The price is now at an affordable and reasonable entry for a company with potential exponential future growth. 
2. It will be shorted to death on the way down and you better believe shorts will over extend themselves and short it at 40, 50, 60, etc.
3. The company undergoing massive changes that has everyone's interest will have just generated the capital to accomplish this goal.  

# So how does that squeeze?

Well, you now have a company with very minimal debt that is undergoing a large transition with a new team and has the capital to accomplish that goal. This very company also just received the world's most expensive marketing campaign, absolutely free. A very juicy looking buying opportunity to investors, a good entry point for FOMO buyers who missed both squeezes, a price for institutions to begin re-entering, people who profited off the first 2 wanting round 3; essentially you will have people piling in.

On the other side, you will have shorts, a lot of them, who think GME should be trading at $13/share and will gladly be opening unfavorable short positions on the ride down. These will be the first domino's that will be tipped from the piling in, and the whole show will start all over again. 

PT for a third squeeze? No idea, and I don't care. Why? Because when I *invest* I don't know what an exit strategy is, but when I *trade* I stick to my exits. I know how much profit I want to take and how much risk I'm willing to take for said profit, do you?

# For Those Who Think the Squeeze Hasn't Been Squoze

Do whatever you want. You have your opinion, I have mine. Let's chat about it, I'm presenting you the bear case and potential bull case that I see, what's your cases? This is the stock market, it is not fueled by hope. Play the best trades you can, find the next target, repeat. Emotion is the most dangerous enemy of an investor...I know from experience. 

I don't care if you buy, sell, hold; do whatever you want. I just ask that you examine my case, agree or disagree, and formulate your own opinion based on your research and what other folk's think. I'm simply here to analyze.

# So What's Your Play Hooman?

I exited on the first squeeze, I didn't play the second squeeze (other than day trading), and I will be loading up for the third squeeze. What am I doing right now? Waiting. The price is way to high to open a spec position. If they start selling off shares, the price will fall back to reality and I will re-enter for a potential third squeeze/long-term growth play.

**TL;DR:** I'm not a shill. I don't care what you do. This is simply my take on the situation. There are no significant upcoming catalysts that could force a squeeze at these price levels. All potential catalysts have already passed and sadly the price was too high for them to mean anything as they were all simply labeled as ""priced in"". The only way this squeezes is if the price comes down first or something seriously crazy is happening in the background that none of us see. What will cause the price to come down? GameStop selling their shares to fund their digital transformation. Could it still just squeeze? Probably, it's GameStop, wild things are always happening. But there simply is not enough convincing evidence that it will. I think a third squeeze is possible and with a fairer entry point I would enter based on that possibility or simply because I think this is a great growth stock.

04/01/2021,stocks,"A lot of people here will see a post with GME or squeeze in the title and immediately dismiss it, but this OP does write quality stuff. I’m glad it exists cause most of the “dd” on the topic has devolved into wild speculation and conspiracy theories. Before you get salty at it just keep in mind that OP is clearly trying to be reasonable, which is more than can be said for 99% of DD posts"
04/01/2021,stocks,The giant black hole in this DD for me right now is the fact they said in their meeting and written in the 10K that they have the capital to transform themselves AND fund themselves for 12 months. Why burn customers for money when you dont need to?
04/01/2021,stocks,"I like your reasoning here, but would say rule 801 is the last big catalyst. When (if) that passes, and nothing happens, then the squeeze won't happen, the same shenanigans will carry on until RC sells some stock to kick transformation into overdrive. At that point what you describe as squeeze 3 is the logical outcome.

With the amount of liquidity rules ramping up across the board, plus a likely margin call chain looming with Archegos positions still sitting at banks, I would not count the squeeze squozen. (Admittedly, those hit the market generally, but GME will still get a boost with apes holding.)"
04/01/2021,stocks,"We have been conditioned to fight opposition.  Left vs Right.  Black vs White and so on.  Conditioning separation is a distraction tool used to conceal and control.  Once the curtin is pulled back you realize the greed, corruption, and  distain ""they"" have for us.  

There is a powder keg in the stock market and dozen have been placed in society.  We need to learn to stop fighting and start listening.  Pretty soon one those kegs will ignite creating a chain reaction."
04/01/2021,stocks,GME is a hilarious meme but most of this is a pretty reasonable take. I think GME is great for ppl who wanna actually day trade but 'going long' at 200 is bonkers.
04/01/2021,stocks,Great DD thank you!!
04/01/2021,stocks,Imagine thinking the only thing that made this was a play was because it’s a new console cycle. Lmao. A cycle in which very limited supply has been made available and wouldn’t help sales as much as a typical console release would.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Like Domo Capital said, they have around 400mil+ cash on hand and it would dilute Ryan cohens stake in the company. Besides if you look at this as a tech/start up company the multiples are forward looking for them. But interesting read"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Long on gme here, been realizing gains via day trading but still holding positions in hope for a MOASS scenario.

While i do share the same bear views as you but i still bank on Gme not selling shares as -

If gme sells their shares and the shares plummet to dust tomorrow, i would have the most lost 4k USD with no recourse and that would be it.

But for the fomo apes in murica who yoloed their life savings, what's stopping them from just paying RC and the board of directors  a visit after shopping at the local gun store. No billions is worth risking personal security imo,  esp in murica where a pistol is like chump change?

It sounds far fetched, but i would bank on gme not selling their shares until public interest dies down + giving the fomo crowd a reasonable exit point. Not promoting violence here, in my country (singapore) this would be absolutely impossible, but in Murica ? not so much."
04/01/2021,stocks,"As much as I want the squeeze to happen, and as much as it bothers the hell out of me that you no longer are bullish on GME, what I always remind myself is that you are also the guy sincerely looking for a bear case on ACTC because you would want to hear the other side - that's the way to do it! You go, hooman!"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Right, agreed that's why I mention that point in this DD. This is dangerous for them, they basically have to decide between the money or the free marketing. But please read edit 2.

Especially since if they do sell shares they literally just told you when they’re filing that they might do that so it’s completely irrational for anyone to be upset if they decide to sell shares. They just told you that they might expand their ATM program and that they might sell shares, if they do that and you’re mad you’re an idiot"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Thanks for that! And I’m just one guy, just because this is my opinion doesn’t mean it’s correct. I very well could be wrong and a massive squeeze could take off I just personally don’t see it right now. If it does fall down to around $50 I will definitely snag a position if I have free capital as a growth stock, not a squeeze play"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Selling shares has always been on the table, part of the 10-K is to lay out all of their options. If Gamestop wanted to cash out, I believe they would have done so already at higher price points.

The thing is, they could have both a company transformation AND retain a high stock value which seems like a win-win scenario.

They've already begun their transformation as well which will bring in additional revenue later down the line. So unless the world shits the bed again, I do not see them selling stock anytime soon. As for a big squeeze, who knows? As you said before, GME right now is a great long term so it seems like a win-win for the individual investor regardless of the outcome."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Reading into their legal writings as a means to look into their actual business strategy is beyond moronic, and is cherry-picking at best considering the document also mentions the short squeeze."

Also, even if they are poorly positioned and aren't profitable right now they're not dumb enough (especially at this point) to put all their money on a single short position, so they have other capital they can use to buy back shares."

2021-04-01 02:57:33,stocks,"BB BlackBerry earnings/call were actually bullish ✅ I see **many** paper-handed individuals dumping their shares for cheap because OMG BB has missed its revenue expectations for Q4. *(for reference $8.50 -8.7% 31st March 2021)*

Can we please dig a little bit deeper? Thank you.

*During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to **mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.** The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.*

**Boom** pure and simple explanation for why the revenue missed. It’s not on weaker demand. It’s only because they are about to sell their side business and consequently they had to significantly cut that stream of revenue. Which also means that negotiations are advanced.

**What will happen then they sell?** they will receive a big fat cheque (don’t quote me on this but I imagine north of $500m if not a billion+ ; pure speculation) + according to the CEO they will collect royalties for 7 years. And they get to focus on their core businesses: cybersecurity, EV software, internet of things.

Is this good strategy-wise? Absolutely. Focus on your top projects with higher gross margins. Let go of the past and embrace the future. 

**any analyst reaction? Yes indeed Canaccord upgraded the stock to Hold** from Sell this morning.

**Canaccord sees 'building blocks coming together'**

*Seeing the business ""turning the corner towards stronger trends”. The firm notes BB's weaker than expected Q4 results driven by licensing headwinds due to sales negotiations for part of its mobile patent portfolio.*

*Canaccord says BlackBerry management has ""created a cogent long-term strategy,"" but the firm is on the sidelines waiting for more evidence of product roadmap execution and emerging cross-selling opportunities.*

*The firm says a deal to sell the licensing business would ""unlock value and provide a capital infusion to drive accelerated software and services growth.""*

So even boomers traditionally late to the technology party are starting to see the whole BlackBerry’s strategy aligning. But these guys stay on the sideline because they don’t like early tendies. They lack the vision to say it’s an actual Buy especially at these levels. They will probably wait that a bigger broker moves first. And they will. 

**a quick look at the numbers** BlackBerry has a $5bn market cap with $1bn+ yearly revenue and $800m in cash. I imagine investors can put 2 and 2 together. What do you think will happen to their balance sheet when they cash in the incoming sale of their portfolio. Way more cash to execute their plans and potential M&A if needed and no need for new shares issuance as confirmed by the CEO (no dilution in sight ; enough money in the bank). We could be in the coming weeks in a situation where BB has in cash the equivalent of 25%+ of their market cap...

**how about their core strategy?** 
*QNX now has design wins with 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs and remains on course to return to a normal revenue run rate by mid-fiscal 2022. BlackBerry IVY also made encouraging progress, with positive engagement from a number of leading automakers and the launch of our BlackBerry IVY Innovation Fund.* 

In just one quarter they added 4 more EV OEMs with QNX (from 19 to 23 now). 

They are well positioned to be involved in autonomous driving: *BlackBerry expands its partnership with Baidu to power next generation autonomous driving technology.* and *BlackBerry QNX Black Channel Communications to be used in Motional's driverless platform.* These are weeks-old news but it’s funny how it seems to go under the radar when it comes to price the company. Correct me if I’m wrong but Baidu could be the first and/or major player in autonomous driving in Asia. 

QNX is still in SpaceX rockets. And I start to hear rumors that Tesla could consider using it too (very speculative but at least you’ve heard it).

And for the people who have ended up here randomly BlackBerry [IVY](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) is a joint venture with Amazon AWS for intelligent vehicle data platform. When the IVY deal was released BB shot past $9. AWS boss/founder at the time is now Amazon CEO. 

So yea the revenue has missed by a few millions for an one-off reason. Have the fundamentals changed? Actually yes they have improved as they are well on track to pursue their strategic goals.

The question you should ask yourself is whether you are pricing BlackBerry based on their FY2020 or on what they are about to become? (hint: strong presence in EV software worldwide + autonomous driving + efficient cybersecurity product)

Before you ask me in the comments: shares are safe, calls good luck timing them although I probably bought more June calls together with some shares (don’t do this at home ; go cash gang ; save your money). Disclosure: long shares and June 20C.

*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*

**TLDR** why are you selling BB? if that’s because the revenue has slightly missed because they are selling a big chunk of their unneeded business for big money then you should ask yourself why you are in this ship in the first place. Even boomers analysts upgraded the stock this morning: they are starting to see BlackBerry business model happening.

Bonus: when will the sale happen? 🔮 crystal ball said before the next ER so in a few weeks (totally random and speculative)."

2021-04-01 02:41:41,stocks,"Why is NASDAQ trade volume at 4% of daily avg. while Dow had a 10000% daily avg. volume today? **EDIT: Yahoo Finance seems to have their historical data calculated wrong, leaving the post up in case others are wondering why. And yes, I meant to say Dow Jones Industrial, not Dow. Data for Nasdaq is also wrong, seeing as they had a trade volume at 11:14 am alone, for 1.59 billion.**

[Dow](https://imgur.com/B6ksdUN) and [NASDAQ](https://imgur.com/9nPzyeH)

This seems like a historic anomaly, yet I can't find any articles or information as to why or how this would happen. 

I've heard some speculation that this might have to do with SLI(supplemental liquidity ratio) that did not get extended, but I don't understand the correlation. Some big players that want to deleverage and reduce their risk?

Someone else suggested it was related to quarterly reports, yet this trade volume anomaly has never occurred at any other end of quarter, or at all(as far as I could see), in the last 5 years at least.

Am I missing something? Does anyone have an explanation?"
04/01/2021,stocks,Yahoo is no longer showing the massive volume on DOW. FYI. Just changed from last I checked

Because something is wrong. Its not a glitch, I’ve been looking at the volumes of these for a year now, and I can tell you with certainty it is not a glitch. There is a small group of massive accounts propping up these ETFs. In fact, I’ve suspected almost the entire market is like this. I basically saying that literally one group of guys are propping up nearly the entire stock market. And I don’t think they can do it much longer, that’s why you guys are having red days that seem random, it’s why you see billion dollar hedge funds going bankrupt and margin called, it’s why it contradicts the news, it’s why they seem to shoot up massively and then drop down.

2021-04-01 02:10:09,stocks,"looking for some more advanced help regarding market orders and how they work... I am currently invest heavily into EEENF and the future progress of the stock completely rides on this weekends announcement of oil or no oil. If on Sunday they announce that there is oil then the stock goes up and all is well. IF they announce no oil and the well is to be plugged then the stock is going to crash... hard.

So, my question is this. If I get the news that they are going to crash on Sunday. What do I do? I assume my best bet is to set a market order for open and hope for the best? Right? If so... how does that even work?

Secondly... Do market orders work in a single file line sort of way? Lets say I place a Market order at 4:30PM on Sunday and somebody else places on at 9:30PM on Sunday night, will my Market order be executed first or is it random?

Thank you so much for any help you guys can possible give me. I'm in a possibly life changing situation and I'd really like to be prepared. :)"
04/01/2021,stocks,"So if the stock opens and has huge selling pressure and you use a market order it’s most likely going to take you much longer than automated algorithms selling off the stock and computerized trading models trading it as well. So by the time you hit that market order to sell the stock and confirm your trade the bid on the market order could be severely skewed bc of the selling pressure.

By simply placing a stop loss/sell limit, your trade will execute at the exact price that you are asking for. And in terms of a stop loss, if the stock doesn’t end up going down, the order won’t execute, and you can just cancel later on if it the sell off you were expecting does not happen."
04/01/2021,stocks,"It’s just never a smart idea. You will always get a worse trade than what the stock is at with a market order and you can easily just set a limit order in that case and or a sell limit/stop loss and get exactly what you are asking. 

Say a stock opens on Monday trading at $10/share and this guy is scared of a quick sell off like he said. Placing a market order to sell is gunna give you such a worse trade with such elevated selling pressure then if you simply place a sell limit at a specific price at the open. 

I’ve been trading for over a decade. My first year or two in I used market orders. I literally haven’t used one on absolutely ANY situation since for ANY reason. Now it’s not necessarily that bad if you did use one, but your just not optimizing your trades. 

So I stand by what I said. Absolutely no use for market orders."

Using the lower end of  Paysafe’s forecasted EBITDA ($500M), $1.5B revenue, an EV adjusted for  $1.8B debt, and applying the post-merger pro forma 720M outstanding  shares, here are Paysafe’s potential share prices based solely on sector  peer **EV/EBITDA ratios:**

Note: Most of these companies have negative earnings and smaller margins than Paysafe.

I’m  not suggesting it’s worth this much, but for reference, averaging the  above multiples would put BFT/Paysafe’s share price at $135.98

More realistically, taking the average from the lowest four puts the share price at $50.75.

Paysafe is the number 1 digital wallet in Igaming, Draftkings uses them, and most recently they just partnered with Coinbase. As all SPACs do now, it sold off big today with the ticker change so there has never been a better time to buy than now!

That’s just the truth, and I’m a proud Paysafe holder. Honestly, my thought on PSFE is that it’s a great long term hold, and a potentially great short term play, but it will most likely be an awful mid term play when those lockups end. 

I could be wrong, but my plan was to hold up until lockup and sell, and then buy back in on the crash. If it doesn’t pump enough before then to warrant selling then I’ll just hold it and weather the lockup expiration."

04/01/2021,stocks,Brilliant idea.
04/01/2021,stocks,"For both CVC and Blackstone, they simply aren’t in the business of holding public companies, and with their amount of shares, they are at a massive profit already. They will almost certainly sell if it’s above $10. As for the other PE investors, you never know. 

Again, best case scenario, by the time lockup ends, there’s enough buyers there to buy up any dip. It’ll be a massive number of shares, but if it’s trading at say $40-50 and the lockup drops it to $20, hopefully the sentiment is strong enough to see that as an ultra buying opportunity."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I mean in all honesty, I think this thing is conservatively worth somewhere in the 25-35 range as is. If it shakes the spac curse and gets some love in the near term, I wouldn’t be surprised to see it basically following the draftkings trajectory and settling in around the $50+ range, but I’ve also been expecting that run for awhile now. In my opinion, anything under $20 is a steal, though, as with everything, the lower you can buy, the better. Current price is crazy cheap, but that doesn’t mean it can’t go lower. I would think the PIPE investors would want it to stay above 12 though as their shortened lockup depends on it. 

It would take a more sizeable run from here for me to consider cashing out and buying lower, but I imagine we’ll have a lot better idea on public sentiment the closer we get to that lockup."

As of right now, Biden is speaking about the huge infrastructure plan. This plan is spread out over 8 years and will be paid for in new tax hikes. The tax plan is expected to raise the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent, end federal subsidies for fossil fuel companies and increase the global minimum tax paid from about 13 percent to 21 percent, as well as other measures aimed at taxing corporations that shelter profits offshore to avoid taxes.

IMO, the rare earth elements (REE) space is going to grow at a fast past over the next few years and decades. If you don't know what REE is, it's a group of 17 metals (lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium) that appear in low concentrations in the ground. The popular ones used in mainstream commodities (such as electric vehicles, batteries, and energy storage) are lithium, graphite, cobalt, nickel, and copper.

There was a Global Metals & Mining Live Virtual Investor Conference yesterday and today that saw several companies pitch their companies and talked about what they do and the how the mining business will see a lot of growth for the next several years.

There's two US based companies that I would recommend and that's MP Materials, ticker symbol, MP and Energy fuels, UUUU. The reason mining rare earth metals is so important for the US is because we have to become independent from other countries to mine, specifically China. China supplied 80% of the rare earth metals to the US from 2014 to 2017 and they supply 75% of the rare earth materials to manufacturers. There is only one US based rare earth mine and that's California's mountain pass mine. Guess who owns it? MP Materials.

I made a spreadsheet list of stocks and ETFs that may see some benefit from this plan. Tabs on the bottom so its divided by each category.

>FY2021 was the American Rescue Plan

I disagree. Congressional budgeting is literally the art of doing as much as possible while using the least options, and doing the absolutely most possible without the parliamentarian complaining

For example, the American Rescue Plan **did not use all three for this year**. For example, it didn't touch the debt limit, so they could use it for that later. 

So that means there are two potential reconciliation events available for FY 2021, the leftover McConnell topic and the 2021 debt-limit topic. 

There is also this:

>According to a Schumer aide, his team is now trying to make the case that Democrats would be able to pass up to three budget reconciliation bills this year. In arguments to the Senate parliamentarian, an in-house procedural expert, aides are pushing for a third bill by citing an arcane rule that hasn’t been used before.

>Per Section 304 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, budget resolutions can be revised if they’re updated before the end of the fiscal year that they cover: If Democrats’ argument stands, for instance, they could go back and amend the resolution for the 2021 fiscal year, and include instructions for another reconciliation bill. Any new legislation could theoretically focus on Democratic priorities that the original bill — which contained $1.9 trillion in coronavirus aid — didn’t include."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Honestly the rule should be changed to only ban low effort self promotion. If someone just drops a link to their website or YouTube video, that should be removed, but if someone makes a high effort post and then adds a small link at the bottom, IMO that's fair."
04/01/2021,stocks,"LOL - sure you can have a separate debt limit bill that just raises the debt ceiling if needed, but that is not going to have the type legislation in it we are talking about (which would impact spending and revenue).

I am aware of what Schumer is trying to do (kudos to him for trying) - amend the FY2021 American Rescue Plan since it is still FY2021.  This is not passing a separate budget resolution bill and it is questionable if MacDonough (parliamentarian) would allow this as you could piggy back off a budget resolution bill to avoid the 60-vote requirement throughout the FY (certainly an interesting proposition though)."

04/01/2021,stocks,"The issue we've seen is a lot of users are attempting to drive traffic to their monetized youtube, discord (that they charge to gain access to channels), or other reddit sub where they then monetize access to stock data via patreon. These types of posts have increased quite a bit over the past 2 months with the subs growth. Users have also gotten more creative with how they go about doing it to avoid triggering automod filters right away, e.g. burying it in a google sheet link. Op was willing to remove the links which I appreciate but you can tell from their post history they have been setting themselves up to heavily self-promo their social media and subreddits.

04/01/2021,stocks,"There used to be a rule on Reddit, not sure if it still is, that is 90:10. Basically only 10% of your posts/comments can be self promotion. A lot of subreddits follow this. The idea is that self promotion is okay if you're an active member of the community, but you shouldn't treat Reddit like a place to advertise and then disappear.

IMO the way /r/stocks could adapt this rule would be to have a 90:10 rule, but all self promotion must be high effort and not just a drop of a link.

So for example, if someone writes up a post like this one and then drops a link at the bottom, they should be expected to engage in the comments with others, answer questions, etc.

If someone is constantly just copy pasting articles from their Site to Reddit and then linking their site, and never commenting on any posts, then I'd say its fair to remove posts, warn them, and ban if it continues.

But if someone is actively participating in the community, and happens to link their content from time to time, IMO that's ok. It's hard starting out, but if someone puts in the effort to not be an annoying spammer, IMO they should be rewarded for their contribution to the subreddit."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Correct, the reddit rule is more than 10% is considered spam. This is something the mods have discussed before and we take it into consideration with regular stock contributors. There are popular posts from regulars where we get tons of self-promo reports but we have left it up.

I do too much math and stats at work every day to want to obsessively track that $500.

I’m up 39% in this past week now that I’ve got half a strategy formed, so I figure the chances of me slooowly turning a profit are probably a tad higher than losing it all. Not gonna be anywhere close to this success every week, of course, but I’ll be happy as long as I’m making a higher % than SPY.

Boeing has risen a little but isn't near ATHs like other reopening plays. However Boeing seems like Chipotle after the ecoli scandal due to the two planes that crashes prior to COVID-19. Took awhile to rebound but it ultimately did. Southwest and Alaskan also just put some orders in so I assume others might follow suit.

The chart almost looks like a teacup forming.

04/01/2021,stocks,I like $SPR in this space. They make parts for Boeing as well as airbus. They’ve had a decent run lately but definitely still have upside in my opinion. This is my exposure to the sector.
04/01/2021,stocks,"I’m long Boeing for sure. It’s down way on it’s pretty covid highs. 

Long term it’s a solid business that’s a staple in the us govt defense. 


If the us spends more and more on space, and stupid stuff like space marines (won’t be called that but us govt defense will be heavily space oriented) then they will use companies like Boeing to get there. 

Boeing has some space contracts with nasa already and I think this is just the beginning. 

They have debt. But interest rates are low enough that debt is nothing these days.

They are one of two big civilian plane manufacturers (other one is airbus), so there is no way US governmemt will allow it to go bankrupt. They also make military equipment and I personaly think drones that fly and work along side fighter pilots are the future, amd boeing is developing one (loyal wingman) so when they start selling it, it's going to be an instant hit."

04/01/2021,stocks,"I hold positions in BA but airbus makes a plane I will happily fly on, too."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Lol I'm up over 100% on Boeing and it will continue to go up, probably mid 300s by end of year. All that matters right now is putting COVID behind us. When THAT is done they can worry about debt and other factors. 

Also, funny you didn't even touch on their massive decade PLUS backorder of planes lol."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Day trading as a retail trader is just dumb. You need to identify an advantage if you want to consistently beat the market and I’m not sure what advantage a retail day trader could possibly have over other markets participants. For a start algos have a huge speed advantage and professional traders have a significant data advantage, where as you’re probably trading on your phone from an app that sells your order flow to Wall Street.

As a retail trader you might be able to identify a stock that’s undervalued with some attractive catalysts to go higher over the course of several months or years, but what that stock does on any given day will depend more on economic news or if some large holder decides to sell their position. As a retail trader you won’t get a heads up on events like these, but professionals on Wall Street are often aware before anyone else because that’s their job.

On the rare occasion that I day trade now it’s by accident. For example, occasionally I’ll be in a position that intend to hold for several months but if on the same day it just happens to be up 10-20% I’ll typically take profit. I think day trades like this are okay, but if you’re actively trying to day trade  research (and my own experience) would suggest you’re extremely likely to under perform."
04/01/2021,stocks,"If u lost money on a day like today, u’re tryin to b way too smart and overthinking things.

You don’t have to perfect to make some extra money, especially as an hedge to cash holdings. If a stock goes lower than I thought, I hold and have less cash for longer than I thought. 

Maybe, I’m describing swing trades, but I’ve been jumping in and out of AAPL with decent success.

One day AAPL will have one of those crazy vertical days, and I might not be as heavy in it as I could be. But that would have happened anyway if I had cash sitting there waiting for the market to be less choppy. 

Retail has access to so much information these days, it’s not voodoo..."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I used CMEG with DAS trader, with ToS for supplementary charting and futures, Fiviz and Tradeideas for scanning. I have hotkeys configured with pre-defined risk if I so choose (stop loss; take profit) for rapid trade execution, and I watch the tape/ level 2 data. I have multiple monitors and trade on earnings, momentum, reversals, some scalping, that sort of thing.   
I'm going to either move to low ATR high float stocks that don't have large candles (more time to prepare, execute, exit trades) (think: opposite of TSLA) or stick with Index/T-Note/Agriculture futures as I'm better at those. Index futures seems easier to gauge based on technicals and is a gauge of entire market. In other words, most stocks have a beta above .5 meaning they follow the market to some degree, except index futures don't have as many nasty surprises as you get with stocks where you're competing with algos and people taking profits as soon as you're in enough green.   


I took a while to scan stocks for momentum trades, and found that their momentum mirroed that of the market in a majority of cases, and in those cases, I could make X return for a fraction of the capital with futures on the same swing.   


I have done a significant amount of research and am aware of the statistic (read: fact) that day traders lose in the end. I know a very small percentage of day traders are profitable.   
In hindsight, I wish I would have taken my life savings and just invested it in some good ETF's when I quit my job, but alas, I lost a fair amount of money when I was a total ameteur, and am determined to keep getting whacked with a stick and ultimately strive to be the small minority of profitable traders.   
Ultimately I would like to grow an account so that I transition away from active trading to more passive investing."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Fair enough. I often recommend people give day trading / swing trading a shot if they’re curious because even if you’re statistically likely to underperform or lose money there’s still a lot to learn from trying if you can afford to take that risk.

The majority of my portfolio is now long term holds consisting mostly of stocks but I still do some swing trading and hedging from time to time when I see opportunities. Thing is I know statistically I’d be better off just passively investing everything in an index fund but I’ve been in the market for about 10 years now and I tend to beat it a bit each year with my current strategy. Perhaps it’s just luck, but even if I start underperforming a little I learn far more as an active investor and I too aspire to beat the odds.

If what you’re doing is consistently netting you returns close to an index fund then go for it. Some people definitely can beat the statistics, but it’s important to know what you’re up against first."
04/01/2021,stocks,"This is why I explicitly said retail day traders. My point was that you have no real advantage against the market day trading if you're using an app like RH with technicals your pulling from trading view or something.

What are your thoughts on their recent transition from hardware to software. 

Their QNX cyber security system (now has Level 1 government security clearance and is used primarily by The U.S government including the Pentagon and Airforce, military etc.)

and with their new recent partnership with Amazon, Baidu (Chinas google) etc.? as well as the new IVY cloud computing e services that may be on most EV’s in the future?

I believe they might have used QNX to build up their clientele in security including the government, healthcare and automotive industry: https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles

and using the IVY subscription services ( cloud computing software that takes vehicle data and sells it to automakers, insurance companies, respect and development) to increase their revenues in the next 2-5yrs from all partnerships they’ve accumulated under the radar in the last year or so. Do you think it could be undervalued?

Their revenues from subscription services in their new IVY cloud computing software shouldn’t be priced in until early February next year, so I guess we’ll see early next year.

However, **ADP private payrolls** growth of 517K only a bit better than 500K consensus. March **Chicago PMI** highest since Jul-18. February **pending home sales** missed on tight inventory. **China manufacturing and services PMIs** **surprised to the upside**, hitting three- and four-month highs, respectively. **Eurozone headline and core inflation came in softer**.

Multiple reports noted **Biden to let Trump's H1-B visa ban expire**.
   * **WBA** beat and raised with Street positive on execution given COVID headwinds. **LULU** beat with Street positive on digital sales strength and momentum into Q1 but some disappointment 2021 EPS guidance light on Mirror dilution. **CHWY** a standout after it beat and guided above with takeaways positive on rebound in new customer adds and opportunities in healthcare. **KR** reconfirmed FY21 comps guidance but bar high. **CLF** guided 2021 EBITDA above the Street with takeaways noting the company's leverage to stronger domestic steel prices. **PVH** results mixed with revenue below but EBIT ahead while FY guide below on softer NA outlook but not really a surprise. **BB** revenue missed.

      * March **ADP employment report** showed a gain of 517K, ahead of estimates for 500K and the highest since September. February was also revised up 59K to 176K.

Unemployment rate expected to fall 0.2 pp to 6.0%, while average hourly earnings expected to hold at +0.2% (and down to 4.5% y/y from February's +5.3%). Some sell-side previews noted upside risk to payrolls could be driven by strong reopening momentum, with some real-time data showing fastest activity growth since last summer.

   * **Still no clarity on what exactly is coming in Phase 2 of Biden plan:**
      * While programs announced today in Biden's ""American Jobs Plan"" to focus on physical infrastructure, White House also preparing another round of proposals which could bring the total pricetag for this effort near $4T. Administration officials speaking about this next phase only in broadest strokes, though likely to include family-centered elements such as improved health coverage, expanded child tax benefit, and paid family/medical leave. Structure and timing of this follow-on effort remain unclear, though idea of pairing physical infrastructure with other traditional Democratic priorities plays into notion Biden hopes to engineer a broad overhaul of the economy in the mold of FDR's New Deal or LBJ's Great Society. No rollout date for phase 2 has been announced but commentators see a speech coming sometime before the White House's climate summit on 22-23 April.

The SPY briefly reached record intraday levels. Market participants continue to monitor rising Treasury yields and digested President Biden’s newly proposed $2 trillion infrastructure bill, which could include changes to existing tax policy. Today marks the final session of Q1 of 2021. 

Ahead of President Biden’s address later today, the White House revealed a new, massive infrastructure proposal. The proposal includes roughly $2 trillion to help rehabilitate and build out the country's infrastructure, address the crisis around climate change and curb economic inequality. To pay for the proposal, Biden will propose raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% for 15 years and implementing other policies to disincentivize offshoring. View a complete breakdown of the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html).

Today marks the final session of an extremely volatile quarter. Year-to-date, cyclical, energy, financial, industrial and reopening stocks have strongly outperformed tech and high-growth stocks that led the market higher last year. As the pace of vaccinations increases (roughly 3 million doses distributed per day in the US), it seems market participants have been rotating to stocks poised to benefit from the gradual reopening of the economy. 

Despite signs of economic improvement, market participants are concerned that the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy, combined with massive fiscal spending, may cause an unwanted rise in inflation, reinforced by the recent climb in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (1.735% at the time of writing). Looking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated[ to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) in March — the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic.

2021-03-31 23:29:47,stocks,"Quantifying Beta Slippage (Why Leveraged ETFs are Not as Scary as You Might Think) (results linked below)

If you are somewhat familiar with leveraged ETFs you have no doubt heard the many warnings that surround them. Warnings involving phrases like ""decaying value"" or ""daily rebalancing"". However, you, like I, may have also noticed that all of these warnings use hypothetical examples to show why leveraged ETFs are risky. These examples will be scenarios such as ""daily SP500 returns oscillate between +10% and -10% for 50 days""; scenarios which are incredibly unlikely to occur in the actual market. Additionally, any novice trader can check the graphs of TQQQ and QQQ and see that (as of today) they would have outperformed QQQ if they had bought and held TQQQ at *any* point before September 2020. So what to do with leveraged ETFs?

All of the fears relating to leveraged ETFs are neatly captured in the term ""Beta Slippage"": Beta (volatility) + Slippage (difference from expectation). It is true that the trend and volatility of a market/sector directly impacts the performance of leveraged ETFs based on them. But are all leveraged ETFs inevitably victims of Beta Slippage as some articles would imply?

To answer these questions I set out to quantify Beta Slippage for the top 25 (by NAV) leveraged ETFs, and see if the fears were justified or overblown.

If you aren't curious about how this was done, the results spreadsheet is linked at the bottom.

If you are:

I used TD Ameritrade's API to get price data for leveraged ETFs and their underlying securities. I then looked at all of the possible 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year holding timeframes a trader could have held the ETF for. I then found, for each timeframe, the return of the underlying security. I then calculated the return of an ideal leveraged ETF using the return of the underlying security and the ETF's leverage factor. This ideal leveraged ETF perfectly scales performance over any timeframe. Finally, I found the % difference between the price of the actual leveraged ETF and the price of the ideal ETF. I called this % difference Beta Slippage, as  I could not find a formula for it elsewhere.

So, in short, the results in the data show the average % difference between an actual leveraged ETF and its perfectly leveraged version (no beta slippage) if you hold it over various timeframes.

Please take a look at the data, let me know how you think it could be improved!

I could not find exact indices for some of the underlying funds so I had to settle for ETF versions of them, also some symbols had very limited data so take that into account.

My response was as much a question as recommendation — they might say “because I’m financially independent and I think it’s fun” which is a reasonable answer.

PACB is a Gene-sequencing company. Gene-sequencing is about reading and learning genes. Its able to locate abnormallities/deviations in gene, leading to diagnosing rare diseases or finding a way to fix known diseases that yet need a solution. (fixing diabetes for example)

Gene sequencing is what makes gene editing possible. (Gene-editing is where you change your genes, that can cure disease or atleast treat a disease) All though Gene-editing is still quite new, a combination of these sciences could change the world and its healthcare.

‘’Ok cool.. but Pacbio isnt the only company doing this.’’

That is true, what makes PACB special is that not only are they global leader on long read sequencing technology. They massively improved gene sequencing, called Hi-Fi ‘’smart sequencing’’. Which is the most accurate long read sequencing technology on the market.

Their flagship model Sequel lle has $700 cost savings per human genome, has a 90% reduction in data storage needs and has around 75% reduction in data analysis time.

What I really like is that their new CEO Christain Henry is a businessman. PACB’s number one objective is to expand their global reach, the sale force has doubled this year and PACB is more  focussed on marketing and customer support to enable growth. They also received a 900million dollar of Softbank to accelerate their growth regarding product development and commercial aspects and another thing that i would like to add is that Labcore is doing research on Covid-19 using PACBIO technology.

# Financials (in millions)

**Revenue (TTM):** 78 million**Cost of revenue(TTM):** 46 million**Gross profit(TTM):**  32 million

**Solvency**  
PACB has a common stock equity of $335,491 and total essets of 413,980.

335,491/413,980x100 = 81,04%. I wonderd if i calculated this right, otherwise its a great result.

**Debt to assets**  
PACB has a debt of 41,99941,999/413,980 = 10,15% which is also totally fine for me.

**Profitability**  
PACB has a net income of $29,403 if you devide that by the common stock equity of $335,491 you get a profitability of 8.7%.

**EPS**  
EPS of 0.17 TTM  
EPS of 0.18 2020  
EPS of -0.55 2019 and EPS of 0.76 in 2018.

**P/E Ratio**

Now dont fall of your chair here. The EPS is 192.82. That is a lot. However keep in mind that you are paying for a bio science company that is focussing on the future. Development takes a lot of time and also costs a lot of money. For a big company like Illumina there is a P/E of 85.

This number does not say everything, but its a nice indicator that you are buying shares for what the company COULD become. Not what they are. You are always taking a risk.

**Loose numbers**

· The company holds a total cash of $318 million

· The marketcap is 6.038 billion. The market cap of ILMN is 55.4 billion

· Their forward P/E is -44.66

· Total inside shares are 4.7 million. (around $141 million)

· 99.44% % of Shares Held by Institutions!

· ARK investment has 28,504,629 shares.

# Negatives

· The stock is extremely volatile

· Balance sheet is ok but not great

· The competition is fierce

· The investment is RISKY. No matter how you look at it.

· The companies revenue and other financials are not stable, difficult to make a guess

· The stock price has had an enormous peek already, in July 2020 the stock price was $4.73, now its $32.50 per share.

· PACBIO still has to prove themselves to be succesful in the long run, its not a safe investment, it all comes down wether you believe in them or not

· People are afraid of gene-editing because people are speculating that rich people will be able to change the genes of their unborn babies, resulting in ‘’super babies’’. (genome editing)

# Conclussion

My girlfriend is a scientist who works with DNA sequencing, so through her i got the idea to start looking into the biotech market. I really like the CEO, I like how the company is growing and the most important part: i REALLY believe that gene seqeuncing and gene editing are the future of our health system. But she might also be a reason why i am biased.

The stock is risky, im -15% as for now and there are days the stock price jumps or falls 10%. I really dislike volatile stocks but for me, the company shows A LOT of potential.

I own quite some stocks and i will defenitly increase my portfolio monthly with this stock.

I am not really recommending this stock, because honestly, this stock could either be $3 or $100 of the end of the year and its also quite expensive.. But I do suggest looking into this company. They are fundamentally strong and I really like the fact that 4.7 million shares are hold with in the company, meaning that the people working for it themselves defenitly believe in it.

**TLDR**; I like the stock but its expensive. You are buying for what the company could be, not for what they are. Biotech is quite a gamble but the company has strong fundamentals.

Now I would like to end with two things:

04/01/2021,stocks,"yeah, i could see hydrogen being useful for commercial 18 wheeler truck routes, it's just not clear that this is a big enough use case to justify the cost of putting hydrogen station all over the country when gas/diesel stations already exist. also, there's kind of a ""what comes first, the chick or the egg"" problem there too, because it's hard to see companies buying hydrogen trucks until AFTER the stations to refill are built.

except there's a very real possibility that gas/diesel would be dvd in this case. a product that still had many years of viability left to it during the transition to bluray, while hd-dvd got abandoned and never became.

as trendy as streaming is right now, once people wake up to the fact content can be removed on a whim (as wrestling fans are seeing with wwe network/peacock right now), there very well could be a renewed focus on 4k bluray (which is a better quality product than low bitrate streaming video anyways)."

Holders from then have made 15x in 16 years as revenues have grown 60x.

PLTR is currently valued at $41 billion. It is likely to hit $3b in sales - like GOOG in 2004 - in 2 years. PLTR has gross margins of 80%. It is one of the best businesses that has ever existed on planet Earth. This simple comparison should be enough to own PLTR today with the plan to hold it for at least a decade, regardless of short term volatility.

04/01/2021,stocks,"I'm getting in BEFORE the hype, that's the point.  Speculative play for sure, this isn't going to the moon tomorrow,, but new ceo and new products in the mix. Their Helomics has accumulated data on 150,000 tumors so far, the largest database in the world. Their Skyline Medical is working on new catheter tech as well. Seeking Alpha released an article in February. So there have been rumblings lately but no major catalysts yet."

04/01/2021,stocks,"I ran across this ticker searching for Porsche honestly lol. It looked interesting and seemed from the chart it was just dipping with everything else speculative during the correction, but on an uptrend. What they have in the works with their 3 segments looks promising!"
04/01/2021,stocks,"Only matters if you hold the adjusted shares past the end of the tax year.

Whenever you do close out the position, you get to claim it as the difference between the adjusted basis and the sale price, meaning you get the tax benefit back on the second sale that was not allowed on the first sale."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I use Schwab and yes I chose to sell my highest cost basis shares, which I purchased in small batches over the course of a few days. 

It's interesting what you say about the sale not triggering the wash but rather the buying back within 30 days. My highest cost basis shares were generally the first in and therefore the oldest, and the remaining shares were purchased more recently but were within 30 days of my higher basis shares. Perhaps those purchases were what triggered the Wash Sale rule?"

>No one cares about when you bought before the loss, it's only afterwards.

Just to be clear, the IRS cares. They know if they don't count buys 30 days before a sale in the rule, people will duck the rule by buying new low-basis shares right before selling old high-basis ones."
04/01/2021,stocks,"For what it's worth, wash sales are allowed in both Germany and Sweden (I've lived in both countries). You can sell a security at a loss and re-buy within seconds, and that loss can be offset against capital gains."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Sry to be honest I just don't really understand the mechanism and haven't found a good explanation yet.

My mental model: I'm allowed to have a short term trade, buy 100 shares XYZ on 4/1, and sell 100 shares of XYZ on 4/2 right? Correct me if I'm wrong but if I don't make another purchase there's no wash sale calculation right? But the second I purchase 100 shares again my cost basis gets adjusted, that's what I meant about the badly worded ""no one cares about when you bought before the loss"", it only seems to apply when buying after losses. Ugh why is this so confusing lol, have read about these too many times"
04/01/2021,stocks,Let me rephrase: the cost basis shown on your brokerage account will be $15/share.
04/01/2021,stocks,"Correct. If you sell all the shares and don't buy again, there is no wash sale. But if you buy the next day, the sale is treated as a wash sale.

The ""before"" period isn't included for that situation, it's for the loophole. It makes the rule apply to ""buy new then sell old"" as well as ""sell old then buy new""."
04/01/2021,stocks,"Sorry I'm still so confused haha! Is there any chance you mean average value of your shares instead of cost basis? Cost basis specifically refers to the number used for tax calculations. I've honestly read a few articles and it's still a bit confusing to calculate. When you say `cost basis shown on your brokerage account` is it just the single number, average share price? Or does it usually show a ton of transactions with original share prices and washes?

If it's the latter and we're both definitely talking about complex cost basis calculations, I'm honestly a bit confused and don't know if I can continue down this path lol. Tired from work and honestly just glad I didn't get into finance. But if your mental model matches with the following and you can track exactly how to calculate it I'll submit that you know more than I do and I'll just shut up! Cheers!

> For example, let's assume Lawrence purchased 100 shares of XYZ for $20 per share in June and then makes an additional purchase of 50 XYZ shares in September for $15 per share.
> 
> If he sold 120 shares, his cost basis using the FIFO method would be (100 x $20 per share) + (20 x $15 per share) = $2,300. The average cost method may also be applicable and represents the total dollar amount of shares purchased, divided by the total number of shares purchased. If Lawrence sold 120 shares, his average cost basis would be 120 x [(100 x $20 per share) + (50 x $15 per share)]/ 150 = $2,200.

So yeah Lawrence's **cost basis** is purely based on the original price of the shares he sold-- (100 x $20) + (20 x $15) = $2300. 

In your original example:

1. BUY 10 shares at $10
2. SELL 5 at $5

It seems like the 5 shares you sold had a cost basis of $50. The remaining 5 shares also have a cost basis of $50. Lmk if I'm wrong though, cheers

04/01/2021,stocks,The IRS would likely work with you to remedy the situation. They won’t just force you to file bankruptcy or garnish every dime you make.
04/01/2021,stocks,"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsale.asp

Check out the section where they explain wash sale is not always a tax loss and how it's applied to the cost basis of the purchased lot that caused the wash sale. You still pay $10/share when you purchased it. But IRS/brokerage will view it as $15/share. Only wash sale I've ever done was with Fidelity. They  update the overall cost basis as such to reflect the wash sale, along with a blue ""W"" beside it. Then in the individual stock lot, they mark the ones with 'W"".

In essence what I'm trying to say is people keep saying wash sale kicks in if you sell and then buy. It's not the case. If you don't hold for 31 days after buying, the wash sale rule kicks in if you sell for a loss. That's why wash sale rule covers 61-day period. 

https://www.wellsfargoadvisors.com/pdf/wash-sale.pdf

Even if you buy ABC for $1M, sell at a loss within 30 days for $900K, and don't buy it at all within next 30 days of the sale, the $100K loss will be shown as disallowed loss.

Yes I understand what you're trying to say, I just don't think it's true from my experience and knowledge but obviously could be wrong.

> Most people wouldn’t even think about applying the wash sale rule here. You know instinctively it shouldn’t apply, even though there’s a purchase of identical stock less than 31 days before the sale. Your instincts are correct: the wash sale rule doesn’t apply because the stock you bought isn’t replacement stock for the stock you sold. That’s true because you sold the same stock you bought.

04/01/2021,stocks,"Good explanation.  Yeah buying “substantially” similar securities would trigger it as well.  Example if you bought 1 call of ABC stock then closed that position for a loss, then the next day buy 100 shares of ABC, that’s essentially taking the same position so that loss on the option wouldn’t be allowed"
04/01/2021,stocks,"I’m not an expert but from my understanding it is not illegal to sell a stock and then buy it back within 30 days.  You should take a look at what you are trying to achieve though.  If you have any capital gains (from some other trade) for the year, then the capital loss would benefit you by offsetting these other gains.

Note that This also applies to the 30 days BEFORE you sell at a loss too, so essentially there is a 60 day period around the sale where if you buy the same stock, then you can’t deduct it either."
04/01/2021,stocks,"It is perfectly legal. 

You just do not gain a tax advantage and cannot use the loss to offset any gains you have.

In retrospect it was not a terrible strategy, but I wish I'd let my winners run longer than I did. I'd get up and get out, then buy the next thing, which means I never let the good plays go far enough to outweigh the mistakes.

Our PureCycle TechnologiesSM recycling service converts waste plastic into virgin-like plastic fully closing the loop on the reuse of recycled plastics while making recycled polypropylene more accessible at scale to companies desiring to use a sustainable, recycled resin. 

I haven't really dug into this one too much but I certainly have it on my watch list. Basically, I think if we ever get serious about regulating plastic waste which I expect will happen in the next 5-10 years, this company would see unbelievable growth.

04/01/2021,stocks,">But then again, I try to make money, not make a point about ""green tech"".

I am all about making money in the market.  Being careful is not outdated.  I am careful about new things but delve deeply into them. But being frightened by new things and making sweeping generalizations is counter-productive to making money and thinking logically.  


Dismissing all things in a particular class of stock, without looking carefully,  because you are skeptical is a good way to get passed by.   If you had looked at HASI you would have found a company that has been profitable for 30 years,  pays a passable dividend (I bought it 6 years ago when it sported a  5.33% YOC and a $19 share price), and they have long term (10-13 year) contracts.     


When I invest a lot of things have to line up  such as: a dividend that is more than 4%, a very attractive price,  a clear mission of where they want to go and how they are going to get there, long term contracts, and then there are the financials.   I don't YOLO because I work too hard for my money.    


But in the end, it is all about your level of DD, ability to read and assimilate new material, then apply that learning to successful investing."

Now you have 15$ in your pocket and 1 share of ICLN as you originally planned to.

04/01/2021,stocks,"Um, the Nasdaq hit official correction territory in early March, and some even consider -7% to be correction territory for it.

It does remain true that it's odd that neither the Dow nor the S&P really responded even close to similarly to when you saw the Nasdaq lose 10% in 3 trading days early in the fall. But it's just been a different market for months now, while tech did lead for a lot of the way from early November, the appetite for cyclicals picked up from Pfizer day on.

There doesn't really need to be a catalyst for a rally in April, just to put things in perspective, the index that has a cyclicals lean poked under 30k briefly in late January and after that spent the better part of the next 2 months destroying the bears (seasonality apparently favors it through April too, although I don't think it will lead in April if the market is up in April, which I think it will be but it could turn into a month somewhat like February).

If a company is cheap and makes lots of money, p/e will be low.

04/01/2021,stocks,"I hear what you are saying, and I will consider it, but you all are not making that easy. I guess I have a bit more sympathy for QAnon folk now... No one here examined/debunked the claims, everyone attacked me for bringing them up. I admit I am new to the world of finance, so the idea of shorting treasury bonds seems like a thing that people shouldn't do, seems like the kind of thing that would have wider ripple effects. It has caused some to have ""the sky is falling"" effect, and others to shrug their shoulders, I am having trouble with determining the severity of the claims. On the flip side I know a lot more about politics and know that a lot of stupid crazy poop that shouldn't be happening is. Despite that, even as that is, I know enough to debunk a lot of what the Qanon people are claiming is, but most likely isn't. I have enough knowledge about the political arena to debunk a lot of Qanon's claims, as long as they are listening. But there is still a lot of crazy poop that is and shouldn't be, poop that could mess up everyone's poop, poop that no one likes talking about but should. My answer to that is after I get the vaccine I'm leaving America, I'm not going to say where I'm going but as long as the poop don't follow, things should be relatively good, at least for a while... My previous self cared about the state of America and the world, now I'm more concerned about either future generations beyond America or riding out the apocalypse with style. 

I was just looking for someone here to provide some clarity, I am receptive to an alternative take from a more educated point of view, no one here has provided that. I was asking to potentially be ""de-radicalized"", but no one took the time to examine the claims and tell me why they are legitimate or not. I'm not exiting my positions, but after this is over I will be trying to figure out if I should take the money and run, or reinvest in a better future for everyone. I do want to go long on making a better world for all of us, but when I hear about how people want to go short on our future, that makes me want to exit my position to some beach somewhere where I can live cheap, and die with good drugs. Or in other words, is tomorrow a good time to give up on everything? That is why I am bringing this subject up, making life decisions here. Will we create a stable ground after the squeezening, or is the global economy going to be a perpetual sinkhole?

You are probably being the most honest and sincere of people responding to me, but you still are leaving me with nothing. Where do I go from here? Or do I just have to live with the knowledge that like our environment, political state, our being one step away from nuclear war, and many other crazy poop that shouldn't be but is, we are all f**ked in every possible way? Is this just another thing that we won't solve but will potentially destroy us? Is the only solution to take the money and run to a place where we can bury our head in the sand and hope for the best?"

Every time I do a serious high IQ psychedelic drug I have the potential of expanding my thought perception far beyond anyone else that doesn't otherwise. The idea of what high IQ is today is a constantly changing factor of what a high IQ idea will be tomorrow. Or in other words you  are discounting the possibility that within the ape mind is super high functioning thoughts, because they are apes? Collectively the human mind is potentially the most significant factor/variable in the human experience, but that is a constantly changing factor.

All it would take is some mega scandal involving Elon Musk, like some sexual assault thing or something, and TSLA could tank like nobodies business. So, even though owning all tech stocks isn't great diversification in the classic sense, it's still something. You're protected from one company going tits up because of some unforeseen scandal or something. Like some gigantic Class Action law suit or something. 

Obviously, if the whole tech sector is getting slammed, you're going to suffer appropriately, but you're still a bit more diversified than the guy that just puts his entire life savings into GOOG or MSFT."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Depends on if they're aware of the volatility and risk and accept it. For the average redditor I'd tend to agree, however many (and not saying you) villanize ARK because they don't read the instructions before operating the power tool. 

I'm 8% ARK funds but I'm also 25-30% between Tesla and Teledoc (largest holdings outside of SQ). Ironically I've had TSLA/TDOC before ARK was even popularized so there's that as well. I'll rebalance as necessary (over half my portfolio is index funds i.e. VTI) but I'm not going to panic sell. I don't do options, day trade or anything other than buy and hold.

04/01/2021,stocks,"?? Why would he have an argument for a higher P/E than 7 if he is saying rocket is undervalued?

The video explains that it should be 7 and 7 is good. Very good. Average for s&p is 13-15, and the lower p/e the more undervalued the company is.

The video explained that they do the math wrong because rocket is public only since like august. Instead using all quarters from last year they use only the last two.

If you use lower value of historical p/e average of s&p (13) and multiply that by eps from all 4 quarters (3.39) you get fair price of 44.07. And that is only the previous year. This year the housing market is on the rise."

04/01/2021,stocks,"I'm new to this, but isn't risking 10 percent loss for a 10 percent gain, not exactly ideal from a risk to reward ratio? I thought ideally we're supposed to go for a 3:1 reward to risk, or at least 2:1. 10 percent for 10 percent is 1 to 1. 

Of course, trying to get a 30 percent pop, in a swing trade in a 3 week period, is extremely unlikely. A 20 percent pop is pretty unlikely as well. 10 percent pop is certainly achievable, but if you're risking 10 percent in a 1:1 scenario, you need to have a really high winning percentage. 

A lot of people will set their stop like 3 or 4 percent below their entry. The thing that sucks about that of course, is that you could easily get stopped out, with the stock simply taking a bit of a breather before it continues an upward trend.  The good news, is that you cut your losses quickly, and you're not stuck bag holding for an extended period. The bad news, is that if you set your stop that close, it's likely to get triggered just during the natural volatility. When I say this to somebody, they say, ""If you're getting stopped out at 4 percent, shortly after entering a position, then you're not reading the chart/price-action correctly.

They tell me that if you decide to make a move, you better know what you're doing, and have a strong feeling about it, because if you're wrong, then it's going the other direction, and you're going to  get stopped out quickly, but the good news is, you cut your losses quickly and live to see another day."
04/01/2021,stocks,"I got a 20% pop on SSY today after it traded for sideways for 3 days. A few weeks ago it did the same thing and I took 18% within one week. I got 8% on a blockchain stock twice in the last 2 weeks. My losses have been -5% on BOXL and -3 on LINC after it traded sideways for over a week. 

The portion of my portfolio in which I use this strategy is high risk. I have never bought a stock and have it lose 10% the next day or 2. If it goes to -4% or something, I will use a TSL% of ~4. 

Im not necessarily expecting a 10% gain every time. But I pick the tickers carefully and I definitely dont expect it to tank 5 or 10% right away."

04/01/2021,stocks,"No the pools are just a lot bigger, when most of those guys sell off the notes they do it in 20 million plus bulk, I will try and give a quick breakdown(These are not real numbers but close enough). A dealer takes 1500 notes and sells them to someone like CACC (this is their business model). The dealer will sell his notes to them for .80 on the dollar, so for easy math lets say that the avg sells price is $13,500 so the bulk group is worth $20,250,000.  The dealers REAL cost is closer to $6,000 a unit, so he will sell the notes for $16,200,000 AND he gets to keep his down payments which we will say avgs $500 so he gets another $750,000, after the dust settles the dealer clears out about $7,900,000.  Here's the catch, the dealer is on the hook for all of those loans for the first 2 years, now history and math teach us that in BHPH that in the first 2 years 25% of your notes are going to fall off, so about 350ish.  What the dealer will do is keep a portfolio of deals that are good paying customers in house and when that happens he will just replace the ones that falls off buy back the repo from the lender and sell it again, depending on the state that process can be done in a week and the dealer has his money back again.  Hope that makes sense and helps
some.

quick edit:  The banks take on the loans because they get the 20% plus they draw 21%+ interest on the notes."
04/01/2021,stocks,"How is the bank getting 21% interest? Are these all shitty 15% loans to start?

04/01/2021,stocks,"If the FED is holding rates low, that's money the banks borrow.

Treasury yields and mortgage rates are rising; that's money banks lend.

Since the yield on invested money is rising and the cost of money is stable, the net yield on borrowing from the FED and lending it out is rising significantly. Also they can make the same absolute cashflow as before by lending out less of what they borrow.

I believe this is the FED's plan. They are giving banks a chance to refill their reserves with nearly free FED money while making normal or slightly higher profit on lending. They need to refill reserves because the FED zeroed out the bank deposit reserve requirement to provide liquidity to the public during the pandemic. But that is extremely dangerous, since even a small run on cash withdrawals can cause a bank failure when there is no reserve cash in the bank. So the FED needs to refill the banks before it does anything that makes the public start taking cash out of deposit accounts."

04/01/2021,stocks,"i honestly don’t see how in current conditions how it wouldn’t be more beneficial to put less down payment on house/car, borrow more to be able to invest more.if you get an interest rate of 2% on your mortgage or auto loan, over the life of that loan as long as your investments on average outpace that annually you should come out better off putting less down and borrowing more to invest more."
04/01/2021,stocks,"You gotta read the whole discussion. OP’s plan was to basically put all of his extra money into stocks, without any other plan for the drastic changes that happen to someone’s life in their mid-twenties. He was asked what he’d do when he moved out and said “rent for a while”. But if you’re renting instead of owning it means your investments now not only have to grow enough to account for the down payment he didn’t save for but also have to out pace the rent he is paying every month at the same time. Every extra dollar you put towards a mortgage is now no longer a dollar that has to earn you something but a dollar that has ALREADY earned you something. 

While you make a good point in theory, what you propose only works if you don’t actually need the money. The extra money not to a down payment needs to stay in as long as the mortgage in order to actually see a tangible benefit, but since again OP hasn’t planned for any life changes except for a small 3000 savings, it is highly unlikely it would sit untouched. Which then brings the question what if he need the money in April of last year after it had lost 30% in 3 weeks? 

Also, and maybe you disagree, you shouldn’t be borrowing money to invest in the market. You shouldn’t be doing it with money you can’t afford to lose."

04/01/2021,stocks,"Interesting. EV's are better than I thought, although what you said about gas car stops is far from reality, especially in newer gas cars. I recently went on a road trip in a gas car which was ~600 miles, I'm not sure when the car last was filled up before this trip, but i'm sure it was close to full. We filled it once during this trip. I did not check how much gas was left after we returned home, but there were no warnings of low fuel, meaning there were at least 20% gas left once we returned. 
Filling up a gas car completely takes ~3minutes, which beats the ~25?minutes you were describing to partly fill up a Tesla. Although of course stopping for ~25minutes during a road trip is something you'll do anyways. My biggest problem with EV's are the lack of ""refuel-stations"" for them, other than that they seem to have improved dramatically on their travel-length. :)"

The market usually bounces in April (see market history). If the VIX is still in the low teens, it makes buying put options a lot cheaper.

04/01/2021,stocks,"  From my understanding, if it is passed, 100 shares will become 25. The stock price will be moved up to reflect the change in share price. So you will have 25 shares of GE in the 80 dollar range. The value of the shares will be the same at this point. However, the dividend will be greatly affected because you will have a lower number of shares.  After that, it is up to the market where it goes from there. So if people still want to pay a high price for GE stock, it might go up. Or it could get shorted right back to where it was. I personally think it is a bad idea and should have never been suggested. The high price will make it harder for people to buy the stock and the high price will attract short sellers to go after it again.  Also, the timing of this is announcement was moronic. The stock had been trading up and was getting some good reviews. If they really wanted to bring the number of shares back in line, they could have started to do stock buybacks.
