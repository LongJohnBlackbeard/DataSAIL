03/15/2021,stocks,Exercise means you want to buy the shares at strike price. Press sell and you will get what you are looking for which is Fair market Value
03/15/2021,stocks,Sell to close is what you want.
03/15/2021,stocks,Exercise means to exercise the option to buy the 100 shares. You want to sell the option to accomplish what you’re trying to do.
03/15/2021,stocks,"thank you all for the information very helpful. so it is all built in, I was just clicking the bottom part on Robin Hood where it says exercise, but sell to close is where I need to go. I was being a bit too cautious, worried I would click something and f it up.

now I just need to figure out how to set triggers for options like having a trailing stop selling to close. I don't see this option at all when I go to sell it like you normally do when selling a stock. would be cool if you could set several option triggers like ""trailing stop of -2% & auto close X minutes before market close"".

let's say I already have an acceptable profit and don't want to risk after market fluctuations. I could set trailing stop to maximize the profits, but if it only kept going up all day and stop never triggers, I want the next trigger to kick in and say ok market closes in 5 minutes, go ahead and sell this option right now and don't risk it.

I wonder if it's just a Robing Hood limitation because I don't see any sort of options like this for just buying and selling stocks. I have to manually cancel my trailing stops 5 minutes before market closes and then sell the position."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I have no idea what you are talking about.

Can you share a screenshot of your contract?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"My understanding is you purchased to open a call option.

You want to sell to close, not exercise"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Exercising is not mandatory, you can sell the contract outright for the premium and is generally what option traders do. Exercising is mostly for people who actually intend to own the 100 shares, and some rarer scenarios where calls are so deep in the money you aren't likely to find any buyers"
03/15/2021,stocks,"This. Sell for the premium. If not, borrow some money and then give the person their money back plus 10% on what you borrowed from them to buy the 100 shares. Should cover both of y’all with plenty of cash and everyone wins."
03/15/2021,stocks,"So this would be a scenario where you would want to exercise instead...?

My call option is up 20%, the end date is today, but the stock shows no signs of slowing down. I would need to make sure there is enough to actually buy the 100 shares, but then I could just set a trailing stop to maximize the profits as it could potentially keep going up up up."

03/15/2021,stocks,"I realized just now that you couldn't do a trailing stop afterwards because the market would be closed for the weekend. I was thinking ok well what if you keep it over the weekend because it looks like it will just keep going up. Then realized that it would be better to simply close out the option and then buy some shares of that same stock if you think it's going to keep going up.

Now what about this scenario below...

Buy a call option on Monday with a 1$ strike, on Tuesday the stock is now high enough to take a 20$ profit, but you think the stock might keep going up, but worry it could also drop. So what happens if between Tuesday - Friday the stock keeps dropping and now you completely lost the profit and actually lost money

Why not take the 100 shares at 1.00$ and then instantly setup a trailing stop @ -0.02 or -0.03 (profit is already at 20$, trailing stop loss of .02 / 0.3 x 100 would still be 17/18$ profit). You are completely eliminating the chance to drop out of profitability. If it goes up then you make what you would have made selling the option at the most optimal time without having to constantly watch for the right point to sell it and if it goes down you still profit.

That scenario seems better to me than just selling the option. My plan is to close an option as soon as it's profitable by more than 5% and set a trailing stop of 1-2% to guarantee that no matter what happens I will at least profit by 3-4%.

Don't many people end up losing money on the options because they wait for it to go up more and then it goes down. It would be easier to just allow us to sell the option on a trailing stop, but I don't see this option in Robin Hood, but they are lacking all sorts of parameter triggers.

In Schwab I can actually do something like condition 1 ""If stock X drops below price Y"" then trigger order ""buy Z shares of stock X"". Everything other than options is far superior in Schwab, but the options are ultra confusing in that layout. RH makes options easy to view for someone new to it with the sliding chart to see how you you make / lose at various prices."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Oh I didn't literally mean today, just in my example. I should have said ""it's on the last day, but stock shows no signs of slowing down"""
03/15/2021,stocks,or you could sell the option and buy another call expiring later?
03/15/2021,stocks,"sigh you still don't get it. an option prior to expiration is always worth more than its intrinsic value cause of the added extrinsic value. by law, an option is always worth more than the profit you get by exercising. so if you wanna do that, just sell the option and use the money you get from exercising to buy shares"
03/15/2021,stocks,Thanks for the information. So just sell out even at small profit and buy back in

03/15/2021,stocks,"Thanks, your posts are super helpful"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Depends on your time horizon I think. If your 20 I’d say let it rip go for it. If your 40 maybe trim down ARKF by 7.5%, $SMH by 5%, MSOS by 7.5% and put it in $VTI. 

If your younger you can have more risk tolerance and some of these high growth sectors could be amazing. As well when your younger you have more time to recoup any losses. 

Overall I really like your portfolio mines kind of similar."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Wonder if/when ARK will launch a managed ETF of their ETFs similar to a Fund of Funds. Baron Funds  has mutual funds with some aggressive growth profiles, including some international and emerging market exposure ones. If you look into doing a hybrid passive & active portfolio and like Ark, they may be interesting to look at. I have ARKK from low $80s back end of last year in a taxable account but I bought some of the Baron Funds in a tax deferred account earlier this month to see how they do."
03/15/2021,stocks,"pretty risky, i'd allocate more to VTI. but that said you will probably do very well in the long run"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I wouldn’t put more than 10% to ARKF, SMH, MSOS and PRNT combined. But that’s just me. Maybe, and I maybe 15-20% combined. 45% is just yolo WSB meme stonk type stuff. 

You need a solid foundation for your ETFs. Most people leave 5% of their entire portfolio to speculation, such as the funds you have.

Edit: if you wanna add more risk/reward. Add small caps."

03/15/2021,stocks,"I’m 31, right in the middle.  I realize it’s a little on the risky side but I figured that was kind of the point. I’m pulling about half of my savings account (35k).

I’ve owned a home for about 7 years and have about 65% - 75% equity based on current market value (southern CT, these homes ain’t cheap!).  I also have a portfolio where I just buy stocks (relatively new) but it’s less than 10k. 

 All that being said, I just don’t see the point in going super safe right? I figured that’s what my 401k is for.  I realize the answer is totally subjective but I’m just curious what other people would do if they were in the same situation.  Thanks for the help btw."

Do you believe in large scale adoption of EVs?  Then the majority of electrical distribution will need to be rebuilt!   Think about it,  the wires going to an apartment complex are designed for normal household loads, add a parking lot full of EVs and it can't handle the load. Bigger cables designed for a higher voltage,  also means more steel towers to hold them instead of the household voltage wooden ones.  

You don't need to bet on which EV company,  which Solar company,  which battery company will win, just buy the mining companies and win when any of them do."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Same. I don't like markets that rely almost entirely on government. I think relying on the consumer market is more stable and easier to predict. 

Definitely a lot of money to be made in green energy if the US adopts a German type policy. But I'm not sure if the German green energy sector made more than the Russian oil exporters in Germany's switch to green energy.

03/15/2021,stocks,I agree.  I would expect First Solar to decline in revenue unless they have adjusted their chemistry or have introduced other offerings.  Their competitive advantage really disappeared when silica prices fell.  They also only install their modules on their own projects.  CSIQ sells on the open market to contractors/installers/developers.

Whether you are right or not, this post reads like a pep-talk for those holding BB and getting anxious.I'm long 800 shares BB and we'll see what happens, for the coming 10 years my assessment is:  
\-Expected IRR, assuming same fundamentals: 20% at $8, 14% at $12, 10% at $15  
\-IRR totally dependent on BB turning weak historical performance around and growing significantly in 2021/2022.  
\-Turnaround is visible in TTM numbers 25-Feb 2021, uncertain whether it will continue into 2021 & 2022.  
\-High uncertainty with high upside if they grow and multiple converges towards a cheap B2B Software company.  
\-Mid Core, Very High Risk  
\-HOLD

03/15/2021,stocks,"Charts charts charts. Study left, look at trends, if you know some key dates or news timeline it could help you understand how robust or weak that company is during tough times and how it bounces back.

You analyze past performance to help plan for the future, but nothing is ever guaranteed. The key is to not over leverage on one stock, know when your analysis was wrong and pull out before you lose too much money. Protect your profits, don’t forget to cash out at key levels.

Honestly you can spend hours, weeks studying and planning but the market can pivot on you in a heartbeat. All these DDs you see posted are not all winners. I’ll reiterate, protect your money! If you see your analysis was wrong then pull out, don’t let it suck you into a price range where now you are forced to stick it out with that stock just to get your money back.

Scaling into positions is one of the best things you can do instead of jumping in. ie. you want to buy 500 of AAPL, instead of doing 1 order of 500 at whatever price start with 100, watch the stock for a little to make sure it’s not going against your analysis, add another 100 when you see a good entry point, and so on until you reach your inversement amount. And same thing scale out when you reach target points you set through your analysis so you can cash in on some profits, and you can reload when you see a healthy dip.

There is no secret, just be patient."

&#x200B;

It really shows how some trends are just ridiculous if they continue for 10 years, and on the other hand how some companies are priced for total mediocracy in the coming 10 years.

03/15/2021,stocks,Here are some [examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m4fb1a/dd_fnko_launching_nfts_in_2021/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) of what I do
03/15/2021,stocks,"as a general rule, my criteria are: 

share price is $35-40 or under. If price goes higher I can hold it but not buy more. Under $35 is about the bottom half of all stocks by share price. These stocks can be overlooked, and it fits my budget. This criteria is borrowed from Joel Tillinghast, who manages the Fidelity Low Priced Stock Fund (FLPSX). 

Undervalued (best), trading at fair value, or perhaps even slightly overvalued in some cases where the company is very strong. But not significantly overvalued. Low P/E, P/CF and P/B compared to similar companies. Like golf, the lower the number the better here as a general rule. For valuation estimates, I look at Fidelity, Guru Focus, Zacks, Yahoo Finance, and other sources. When there's a disagreement, I go with Fidelity's valuation. 

Company must be profitable, so all of these numbers should be positive:
EPS (earnings per share); ROE (return on equity); ROA (return on assets); ROC (return on capital); Net Margin: (what % of revenue is profit). The higher the better for these numbers, as a general rule. Compare with similar companies. GuruFocus ratings for Financial strength, Profitability, and valuation should average 5 or better. 

More cash than debt. ""Cash to Debt"" of 2 or better is ideal, meaning $2 cash for every $1 in debt. Company can pay all debts and still have cash savings. No debt is ideal, but relatively few companies have zero debt. 

Business must have repeat, regular customers or payments and not be a one-in-a-million moonshot like a tiny drug company praying for FDA approval. Established and boring is usually better than new and trendy. 

Business has some type of growth potential. 

I think: ""would I want to own this company for 3-5 years?""

I understand the company and can explain what they do to a 10 year old child. 

Lower daily trading volume, usually under about 1-2 million. Big ETFs/funds are restricted from buying low-volume stocks, so more possible bargains here. Being included in an index/fund/ETF tends to drive up share price regardless of fundamentals. But I avoid extremely low volume, under 100,000-ish can get iffy.

Stock price is rising or holding steady over a few years, but not going straight up. 

Company is not listed in the Russell 1000. I want do avoid buying stocks I already have 

A dividend is preferred, but not necessary 

I don't buy on future projections, but current and recent data. 

I don't worry about technical analysis, at all. I think it's astrology for dudes."

I expect the top line to still be not great for next few quarters, but wouldn't discount a reopening 'bump' happening as the beauty space is definitely a likely benefiter. Primary focus at this point though is cost-savings.

Could easily see this thing hitting $12-$13 by mid year."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the tip, never thought of Coty but just checked them out and I'll definitely be starting a little romance with them, maybe love will follow."
03/15/2021,stocks,Same. Ive been holding since 4$ and averaged up a couole times. The new CEOs a rockstar and Coty seems to be a hidden gem
03/15/2021,stocks,"I started a long position with COTY near the bottom, similar to you, because I believe in the new CEO/importing of L’Oreal talent and also thought the Kardashian bets could pay off long term.

It has been a great earner, but realistically everything that was still down in October has provided great returns and in comparison COTY has actually lagged a bit. Ultimately their story is still in a prove it stage, so they need to continue the cost control efforts (great so far) but also realize revenue growth through the Kim/Kylie investments (TBD) along with hopefully more normalized demand in 2021. 

As an investor I’m ultimately hoping they achieve both, and that it leads to enough cash flow to reinstate the previous dividend to pay a fantastic rate on my investment, but we’ll see."
03/15/2021,stocks,"For anyone reading the comments, listen to this person."
03/15/2021,stocks,Agreed. Was delighted when it hit $7 but that sustainable fragrance thing was a fantastic move. Definitely thinking low teens.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I understand what you're saying, but to me I'm not getting it. Why should we help a blank check company break even? I'm not seeing the upside, unfortunately. 

So what? We like the stock, we hold til 10, and our reward? Watch the stock slam back down when the initial SPAC investors back out and then we sell for losses or hold.

That's how it looks to me, I could be wrong. Y'all could get rich. I hope you do."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Possibly. 

But like I said, it feels like we get the volume up, the sell off happens, triggering further selling- and viola even less volume.

If you've come to this dd where it could be worth 25$ or 250$ where's the volume?"
03/15/2021,stocks,Wait doesn’t that mean the market cap is like over $300 billion as of now? Wtf
03/15/2021,stocks,It's against Argo's best interest to dump shares. They'll keep providing shares as liquidity to the market once they get out of the hole they're in. Either way we have a 25% upside to $10.

03/15/2021,stocks,Textbook example of a fantastic company at a horrible price
03/15/2021,stocks,"Costco's forward P/E is: 30.24   

Walmart is 22, Target is 18, Kroger is 12, Albertsons is 10. 

So let us forget our love for Costco for a second and look at this objectively: Why did Costco dip? Because it was valued like a **growth** stock, and growth (over value) was being hit. Why is Costco that big of a growth stock? They haven't really entered new areas, aren't aggressively expanding, and their digital penetration has been so far disappointing (particularly compared to Walmart/Target).     

Honestly I like Costco a lot as a customer, but a 30+ P/E on a *retailer* is quite high even post-dip."
03/15/2021,stocks,This is the most traded pizza chain ever
03/15/2021,stocks,"COST and MSFT are my die hard hold till end of time stocks. Both have solid financials, good reputation (msft consider the least evil among tech big boys) and have good future growth prospects."
03/15/2021,stocks,The customer loyalty with this company is very good. A solid brand is a very good moat that goes a long way.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I used hold WMT TGT KR and cost. Sold other retailer and moved to AMZN COST and HD. I don’t think sam’s club ever can replace COST at all.
When u check COST in other country locations, always packed with people. Costco forever!"
03/15/2021,stocks,"dont forget that WMT used to have 100 P/E long time ago (30-40y ago) too, and if you bough back then and hold, you would have 50x-100x your money.."
03/15/2021,stocks,Have calls on COST. Agree 100%
03/15/2021,stocks,"I had posted this on Sunday FWIW -

FWIW, I'm underwater on Costco at the moment, but I'm comfortable with my investment. COST was way underpriced both before and after their 2nd quarter earnings report (3/4/2021).

It has moved from $311 to $331 in the last three days and I expect it to appreciate another 20% by the end of 2021. 3rd quarter will look good and 4th quarter will trounce prior.

2nd quarter revenue grew 14.6%, but earnings missed expectations due to $.41 Covid-19 hazard/premium pay to employees that ends in March. So, the 3rd quarter will have some premium pay/Covid-19 expenses while the 4th quarter will have a significantly smaller expense.

Other trends in COST favor include possible membership price increase, falling gas prices (increase their gas sales margin), sales increases (1/2 of February goes in 3rd quarter) February up 15.2%, two upgrades last week following all the downward price adjustments after 2nd quarter earnings and E-commerce revenues were up 75% from a year earlier in the quarter that ended Feb. 14.

On the 11th, Wells Fargo upgraded costco to Overweight from Equal Weight and raises target to $370 from $340. And that follows the upgrade by R5 Capital (whoever they are):

Wells believes 'the market's contempt for COVID beneficiaries has created a compelling buying opportunity.' The firm's call is based on the following: 
1) The stock's return to pre-pandemic levels seems to imply that COST keeps none of the upside. At least some share gains should be sticky given member growth, and emerging trends (working from home and de-urbanization) represent incremental positives. 
2) The membership fee looks poised to increase in the next 18 months and represents a potential catalyst for sales and earnings. 
3) Fundamental outlook overall remains bright, especially with the digital narrative improving. 
4) Valuation is near multi-year lows relative to the market.


An interesting tidbit -last year Costco sold more than $52 billion of merchandise under its own Kirkland Signature brand, up 7% from 2019. That is more revenue than Coca-Cola, more than twice as much as Colgate-Palmolive and about the same as Kraft Heinz, Kellogg and Campbell Soup combined."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Kirkland Brand, enough said. Buying Dips once my GME hits the moon."
03/15/2021,stocks,"When they dropped under 310, they looked fairly valued on a historical basis for them. Which means a screaming buy in this market. I couldn't resist. But I only bought a small position. Was rationing cash in the hope of more good deals in growth. I don't have a sell target yet, but if they hit high 300's again I probably won't keep holding."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yep, I loaded up."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I went all in on margin, if that upsets you blow me"
03/15/2021,stocks,$330/share? A hard pass since in this market you can gain (or lose) larger sum elsewhere.

03/15/2021,stocks,I like Kroger.
03/15/2021,stocks,"You are correct for the most part, but Costco just started not too long ago in China.

I wouldn’t be surprised if they start expansion there. Enough to justify 30 PE for retail stock? Don’t know."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Compared to other many other retailers, Costco does have a much higher PE.  Costco has been trading at a 30 PE since 2017.  The quality of Costco's earnings and sales growth over other retailers earns Costco a premium PE.
E-commerce revenues were up 75% from a year earlier in the quarter that ended Feb. 14.
Good luck, I am underwater on Costco right now, but I'm comfortable with my investment."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Almost 30% of warehouses are outside of the US. They've essentially stated they start cautiously into new markets and if everything goes well they will expand. Their location in China did so well that they had to close early due to crowds. Every indication points to Costco doing well in China and if not for Covid their second location would be open by now. 

Also likely to see the price of membership increase within a year or so. That'll go straight to their bottom line."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Everytime I travel out of the country, I go to a brand new Costco or I look for one and surprisingly I find one. A brand new one that is packed full of people. I traveled a lot pre pandemic and they’re aggressively expanding forsure, in multiple countries Japan, China, Hong Kong, Mexico Canada ive been to those even Thailand"
03/15/2021,stocks,I think they dipped so hard due to Buffett selling all his stakes in the company.
03/15/2021,stocks,Truth
03/15/2021,stocks,"I don't even shop a crazy amount with costco and I still pay my yearly costco membership dues because when I want to buy an electronic I look to Costco first for the warranty and concierge and price point, I love my costco credit card (I get like $1,000 back every year), I love that costco at least seems like it has the consumers interest in mind, when you call up concierge and they connect you to say netgear customer service someone is on the phone immediately instead of you waiting an hour. I love that they pay their employees well and give good benefits and kirkland brand is usually pretty solid. Customer loyalty is great, and I can see myself paying dues the rest of my life willingly. I think that's a good model to have."
03/15/2021,stocks,$2 hot dogs go a long way.
03/15/2021,stocks,">  I don’t think sam’s club ever can replace COST at all.

Nope not a chance. Costco will always have something Sam's doesn't: good reputation on how they treat their employees"
03/15/2021,stocks,Really? What are those? COST is just generally a slow moving stock lol
03/15/2021,stocks,You do you my friend :)
03/15/2021,stocks,"That doesn't seem correct...eventually I guess but we are talking about like 12$ a month for executive...I pay that for youtube lol. Plus I get it back every year and then some from my 2% back...I mean costs go up everywhere, it's nice that it doesn't go up Every year. Eventually I could see them hitting a point where it ends up being not worth it, but it would have to be such a huge jump..and I'd probably just switch out of executive down to the regular. Because I'm pretty sure regular membership is currently like 6 bucks a month.   


Hell from a shopper mentality and not a shareholder, if anything raise that bitch through the roof and cut traffic down so average Joe doesn't think its worth it to be a member there. If we are talking purely from a consumer view point, I would prefer the membership be astronomical and them offer a bigger percentage return so the crowds die down and it becomes more exclusive. Now that would be a horrible idea as a shareholder...because that would drastically reduce sales. But wouldn't it be nice to spend an extra 30$ a month and be able to shop at costco in peace?"
03/15/2021,stocks,Did their membership numbers suffer after the last increase?
03/15/2021,stocks,the more expensive food gets means costco has more biz. as people shop there to save money on food. Food prices going up doesnt stop people from eating (well poor people maybe shoot)
03/15/2021,stocks,Why would they raise there prices if they felt it would lose them customers. I'm confident they've done plenty of research on the decision.
03/15/2021,stocks,Homie get some better shoes. Maybe some insoles.  That ain’t Costco doing that to you
03/15/2021,stocks,Is there anything original about Costco to China though? Without real brand awareness there it could become a total flop.
03/15/2021,stocks,"If ur first-generation chinese american, u'll be telling all your relatives back home about costco."
03/15/2021,stocks,Long term not 100% confident of how foreign companies will go in China due to political pressures.

03/15/2021,stocks,I own 9 pairs of my shoes and custom insoles as backup.  Foot surgery.   I only have pain.... In costco.  I mean look at the concrete next time you're there it's so weird f****** concave pattern it's almost like it's trying to force you to walk in a circle constantly lol
03/15/2021,stocks,"I know that when it opened, there was complete chaos as people stormed it. You can definitely check out videos of it with a google search."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah, way cheaper to buy in Costco vs elsewhere in China. People bought memberships, loaded up on the discounted luxury items, then proceeded to refund their memberships right after their purchases."
03/15/2021,stocks,Have you seen how crazy chinese people are with hoarding and trying to get as much of anything they can get their hands on.
03/15/2021,stocks,"People do love Costco though.

I'd buy a bit just to have it honestly."
03/15/2021,stocks,"It comes with a free soda too, and if you are lucky, some locations even offer free refills 

Once I finally got my vaccines, I'm going on a restaurant spending binge including Costco Hot Dogs"
03/15/2021,stocks,"> Investors don't care how companies treat their workers. 

Customers do. Good reputation = customer loyalty = more/steady income = good stocks?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Actually they do. Which is part of why COST demands such a premium. The shopping experience at a Costco is always solid, even though they are packed, because the employees work hard and efficiently to get customers through. This is part of their extremely high loyalty base. Chick-Fil-A is a similar example. High quality product at a good price, good wages, great service, all of which creates a strength of brand loyalty few of their competitors can get close to matching."
03/15/2021,stocks,Well that is certainly strange. I wish you no more foot pain for the future my good man
03/15/2021,stocks,Username checks out
03/15/2021,stocks,I don't know if I consider it a restaurant but the sentiment still stands I guess
03/15/2021,stocks,"No, they do not. Amazon is known for treating their workers very poorly, and Apple hired child workers. Both are the creme de la creme of stocks, and investors continue to pile their money into both. Also, as I'd mentioned, in general, news of layoffs will make a stock's price go up, news of increased minimum wages will make a stock's price go down, forming unions will make prices go down, automation (i.e. the elimination of jobs) will make stock prices go way up, etc.

Uber is another good example. They were already known as an employer that treated workers poorly, but when Prop 22 passed in California, which allowed them to classify their workers as contractors instead of employees, their stock shot way up. Also, investors are very excited about  Tesla (also a company known for treating workers poorly) in large part because they're excited about the possibility of an automated taxi hailing service, which will eliminate costs, jobs, and the need for human drivers. And these will not be eliminating white-collar jobs, either. These will primarily be job losses to low-income people, but investors want the profit from it."
03/15/2021,stocks,"You're comparing 2 different things. Amazon is dominating in every sector.

You should compare Costco to other similar companies BJ, Boxed.com, Sam's etc."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Weird as it may sound, IBM and I just got into AMD.  

I'm pretty new at this, but I like these 2 companies."
03/15/2021,stocks,"MO - they've been on a multi-year downward trend and they sell cigarettes, not exactly the best looking company at first glance. However, that downtrend is starting to break down and they give sexy, sexy dividends. The main reason Im bullish is due to vaping products and weed. Altira has a couple of patents for some cannabis vapes, hired some lobbyists from cannabis/hemp law-firms and are trying to get CBD legalized. They wouldnt be doing that unless they have big plans for the future, and as a tobacco company alot of that infrastructure must commute. The vaping thing is mainly because im in college and some of these mfs vape like a goddamn chimney; life long customers MO can depend on.

DIS- they own like, every single major entertainment property and they show no signs of slowing down. Sometimes I think that they want a monopoly on the entire entertainment industry or something lol. I dont bet against the mouse anymore, its never worked out.

AAPL- well, its fucking apple. And there are rumors that they're trying to break into AR/VR. I work in my school's virtual reality and 3D printing lab. Commercial VR tech is really cool, but so far not the most practical for home use. Setting everything up is a bit asinine, and I cant imagine the average person loading up a VR set on the regular despite the fact that everyone I know agrees that its cool as fuck. I can totally see AAPL dominating the market once they give it the Apple makeover. (more intuitive controls, simple design, more lightweight hardware requirements, easy setup etc.) Best part is, even if this rumored headset goes the way of google glasses, you're still left with a bunch of shares of apple.

KTOS- I like them and did a DD. Long story short, they have consistent and growing contracts with the US and are primed to enter the aerospace field. If it matters to you, the stock is also part of some ARK funds.

APPH- This one is highly, highly speculative and the company I have the least stake in. Theyre an AgTech company making indoor farms, mainly for tomatos but they plan on branching out. I love the sustainable business model, and as someone who uses a similar service (Im in Canada) I believe that theres a genuine need for these types of farms. However, they're a very new company and they probably wont be seeing any profits until they scale up alot more. Its also not like the tech is groundbreaking or anything, so R&D barriers to entry aren't very high. I will say that as someone who grows weed and vegetables hydroponically that the equipment needed for either is almost identical. So, in the case of full legalization theres a chance they might start growing some of that cash crop to subsidize vegetable sales, something hard to make a profit on without economies of scale. Of course, this entirely depends on how legalization is gonna get rolled out or if they even decide that weed is a good bumper crop. Hence why Im not about to YOLO anything into this anytime soon, I just want some exposure. 

COP- I like making money more than I hate investing in oil. And so far this company has made me good money. Green energy may be the future, but that transition is unfortunately gonna take a couple of decades. In the meantime, we're gonna have to power the factories that make solar panels and windmills with something else, and it looks like thats gonna be oil for the time being. Plus, they also have a sexy, sexy dividend."
03/15/2021,stocks,Siemens energy right now not gamesa because it is strong on all fronts and can easily transition into needed territory that's definitely a long hold for me
03/15/2021,stocks,RBLX because I’m not going to be a paper handed bitch and I know they’ll grow within 10 years

03/15/2021,stocks,What are your thoughts on Tesla once all the manufactures put all their focus on EVs?
03/15/2021,stocks,NIO is leaning on swappable batteries though. That's a dead end.
03/15/2021,stocks,you don't think the ship has sailed on MO? it looks to me like it's too late to jump in on it right now
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think it may be a bit overvalued atm but it’s definitely solid in the long run. I bought when the market dipped last March and have been buying/holding since, I feel it’s a stable investment to hold for 3+ years."
03/15/2021,stocks,"As long as you're in it for the long run like the post stipulates, the value right now shouldn't be too much of worry"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Something else I don’t see anyone commenting on in this thread yet is their charging network. Tesla has the best (only?) Charging network that will let you drive coast to coast (at least in the US). Right now that’s a pretty decent advantage.  In the future, when there is plenty of charging infrastructure in place they can convert those so they work for other manufacturers and it becomes a bigger revenue stream for them."
03/15/2021,stocks,"The bet on Tesla isn't so much about the hardware. It's about autonomous vehicles. It's about the software. Tesla is miles ahead in that regard.

They are building from the ground up a software driven car.

You can ask why Amazon is so dominant. Every retailer has a website now. They all got in that game but they weren't designed for it. It's an afterthought. They are so huge it's difficult to steer in another direction. They still keep brick and mortar stores, they will never be all-in online market.

Whats the difference between the Chinese government and the American government. When some people want to change polices there's a lot of debate, in fighting, stalling. I'm sure the large auto manufacturers have people dragging their heels on EVs. They will never be all-in on EV. At least not in my lifetime.

That's my bet on Tesla. But I'm just a dumb retail investor."
03/15/2021,stocks,"the make solar, big trucks , and will be prob making farm equipment. the cars are great and all but its only 1 part of the company. I don't think the stock will dip since it will have other support tiers. Also Tesla is the #1 EV in China think about that"
03/15/2021,stocks,Thats what makes them special. Tell us how it's a dead end?
03/15/2021,stocks,"I agree with you on Tesla. A decade of real world software experience. No competitor is close on the software and data. I’ve been waiting for years for a single competitor to get a working self driving car to compete with Tesla. And here we still wait...

I know people rave about EV, but it’s not like Tesla had the first EV nor have EVs ever been something consumers really cared enough to purchase in quantity.

I would purchase a Tesla for the self driving and view the EV aspect as a cool bonus."
03/15/2021,stocks,"How many batteries does a swapping place need to do a day. How many fully charged batteries do they need to have on hand. How much storage space is that. The minerals are so valuable there's not going to be any excess supply, they will go into new cars.

The vast majority of people will have a fully charged car in the morning. They will not need a charge at any point during the day. They may top off at the point of interest they are visiting. There will be very little demand for dedicated charging/swapping.  

Battery swap NEEDS a dedicated lot. And it will be costly, a lot more than charging ports in a parking lot.

Battery swapping makes sense for the trucking industry that frequently goes long distances running the same routes. NIO doesn't have a truck though."
03/15/2021,stocks,I appreciate your thorough analysis and breakdown of this company. What they are striving to accomplish would be a miracle to all mankind and this is the kind of company we need to win. I’ll be sure to invest in this company. Thanks!
03/15/2021,stocks,Great DD. I poked around a bit on my own and decided to buy a little.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Because I know the volatility of those med stocks  what are you worst downside and best outcome in short terms and longterm especially right now im looking for med stocks for the long term but for me it's like a mining field I don't really know which company is solid for the longterm not only short term.
And from what news where the recent dip/run up?(I only heard biotech stocks suffered hard the last days) If it was a dip it seems like a nice catch right now"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I agree, and I’m both financially and emotionally invested in this company.

03/15/2021,stocks,"**Short term - ""Bad"" Phase 2 results** 

If there were any safety concerns that would've shut down the trial, we would have known them by now, so the only concern is efficacy results. We already know from pre-clinical testing in mice and human cadavers that the drug WORKS in that they were able to fully restore hair cells across the cochlea. The only concern in live humans is how well it works because there is a delivery challenge that doesn't exist when you have a cochlea in a petri dish, which is: how do we get enough of this drug into the lower frequencies?

I can only see good results from Phase 2. Why?

1) They are using multiple doses.   
2) They are using extended audiograms (therefore better measurement outcomes)  
3) They are focusing on moderate to severe groups that have a higher ""ceiling"" in terms of potential improvement.   
4) We have seen Frequency Therapeutics recruit two people this year who specialise in marketing and producing drugs on a mass scale. They would have already had sight of their Phase 2 data before hiring these guys.   
5) Their Twitter feed has also been unusually active lately promoting the lack of awareness with regards to hearing loss, suggesting then that they are already making moves to ""prepping"" the market

**Medium term**

Assuming a positive readout from Phase 2, there isn't much other than speculation that will shift the price between Phase 2 readout and Phase 3 readout. There are some Phase 1 trials running in parallel where Frequency Therapeutics are re-running their Phase 1 but with different target groups - for example, age-related hearing loss patients.

**Long term**

One long-term concern is some kind of adverse event at Phase 3. Some side-effects only become apparent once you test a drug on a large enough population. It's possible that we could see some adverse effect, but there has not been anything yet to indicate that this could happen. The drug is delivered locally, not systemically, so it is very unlikely someone might die or be seriously medically compromised during the clinical trial. Phase 1 results show very low systemic absorption of the drug in the blood tests. I also mentioned that the regenerative process has been shown to be self-limiting ex vivo.

Another is education and re-training of doctors. The expectation is that, if the drug is successful, the demand will be so high that there will not be enough doctors trained in the procedure - an injection through the eardrum - that will meet the demand. It is expected therefore that it may take some time to prepare and train doctors and this may ""cap"" the market cap in the days immediately after market approval. But from a 5-10 year timeline view, I do not think there should be many concerns. 

And yes, now would probably be a good time to buy (not financial advice). It was hovering around the 30-35 dollar mark for a while before speculation took it into the 50s. I do not think that price was a fair reflection given no Phase 2 readout. Inevitably biotech being down as a whole brought it back down to a reasonable level. I wouldn't invest in a biotech ETF or biotech in general for reasons I mentioned at the beginning of my post. This is a unique situation I found myself in."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes, I'm not too sure how obvious I made this but I see this company as a long-term value play. I see a potential market price of $500 upwards if FX-322 succeeds in Phase 3 and that's for hearing loss alone. If it treats tinnitus too I think it could easily go over $1,000. And if their PCA program works in other areas of the body....well, who knows how far this stock could go"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes, tinnitus is a big one that currently doesn’t have much market cap understanding. I suppose you could gauge interest from online support forums but I’m willing to bet there are many more silent sufferers, no pun intended. 

Another aspect I have only done cursory research into are military service members. As I understand it, tinnitus sufferers are eligible for military disability pay. I imagine the government would be very interested in a cure. 

As for PCA’s future uses, I am excited for the ongoing MS research and everything else beyond. I think this week is going to be the start of a very bright future for frequency and medicine."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Agreed, I think the military interest should not be underestimated and perhaps I should add this point to the main body of my post - thanks for reminding me. I know the US military also gave them a grant at some point. 

As for the PCA programme, I do remember them at one point also talking about treating hair loss and I remember reading in their investor report that they also aim to look at other human organs as well, such as the heart, lungs and skin (I think) although don't quote me on that. In any case, that's all superfluous. My DD is based on the data I have in front of me."

03/15/2021,stocks,"There’s different highs and lows. There’s daily, hourly etc. idk how often you buy and sell but that should dictate the schedule you consider your highs and lows. If you plan on buying and selling once a day for example, you need to do your dd and figure out what you expect a good price for the day to swing is. Like the memestonk you mentioned today, it had a pretty wild swing, 50$ or more. If you had decided to sell at apx 275 and buy back in around 225 that would be a great trade provided you actually plan on holding that stock until it swings back up. 

If you think 225 is the safe point at the top for you, then buy at 210 and sell at 225 if you think those are safe entry and exits for a somewhat guaranteed turnaround. 

The problem is you never know which way it’s gonna go. For me it’s usually the wrong way, and i panic sell and cement my losses. Imo the best move is to just add to your positions whenever you can in companies you believe in and have done your dd on. Buy those dips when they’re obvious if you really want to stack long term. 

This is not financial advice, these numbers are not actual suggestions and just examples to help illustrate my opinions. I eat crayons and lose money on meme stocks"

I have 40+ years until retirement so I think it’s good to experiment with both stocks and ETF’s and figure out which is more suitable for me."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'd always suggest considering what the person telling you a thing has to gain too.    

As a general remainder single companies & ETFs sometimes win, and sometimes lose, but fees are baked in *losses*. So when evaluating ""riskier"" actively invested ETFs, seriously consider not only that ETF's future, but also can it beat its own fees. 0.03% on VTI/VOO is insanely low, whereas some actively managed funds can exceed 1% in fees, which could make it a loser even if it goes up over tens of years.   

I think sticking to VOO/VTI/BND is absolutely fine, and if you plan on going riskier I'd be sure you know *why*, have specific personal goals in mind, and have done enough research to understand why the market under-valued the segment/asset. 

Just because something will be successful in the future doesn't mean it is good value today. Sometimes that future potential is already priced in, and sometimes the market goes crazy and the stock/segment can never live up to it."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Just my opinions, do your own research. If it were me, I would not be in BND as a 19yo, or at least have very little (5% or less in it). Bonds just don't return very much in this environment and are primarily for downside protection. If you're investing money you won't need in 10 years or more, I just think its dead money. 

AAPL, DIS are great, solid, I'd stay there. JNJ, eh, for a 19yo, the growth prospects aren't the highest. What do you see for the future of JNJ? You're young, think about companies that will be bigger than today, offer more than today. Apple used to be a computer company. Amazon used to sell books. Google was a search engine. What are the companies today that will be more than they are now? You're young, you can make a bet on a stock.

ETFs like VTI and VOO are great because you have the safety net of not doing worse than the market. If it were me, I'd spread out to emerging markets etfs, VWO looks like a bargain here, and VEA, as they have potential to outperform the US if we do in fact have another ""lost decade"" as some predict."

3) Nowhere in your ""source"" I am able to find the statement that Tesla's auto pilot is ""the most dangerous driver-assistance system"". It is only mention the most. Which makes sense, considering so many tesla's are on the road now. 

4) Waymo lacks a fleet. In order to solve FSD for EVERY city, you need massive amounts of data. Tesla's fleet is generating data as we speak.

The second argument is that teslas cars are so much better, and the   problem with this argument is that cars are subjective, if I want a luxury car I'm going to go with audi or mecrades even if they have lower range, if I want cheap and good quality I'm going with vw, cars are fundamentally subjective that's why no one company has a monopoly.

03/15/2021,stocks,"I agree, I think TSLA will continue to decline for years to come. No one takes into this one simple fact; They have not yet had to act like a car company. Every car they sell has back orders, wait lists, they move the highest margin ones first. Well guess what? That stops soon. 

Next year we are going to start to see the wave of Lease returns. What the hell is TSLA going to do in 2024 when they have to take back 100,000 3 year old cars. They will be holding old inventory they will never be able to love. Logistics alone on storing 100s of thousands of leased vehicles is going to CRUSH TSLA. 

Once they start producing more cars then they actually sell (which eventually all major manufacturers do) their margins will shrink. As their margins shrink they will start to trade like a car company. 1X sales. 

I repeat by 2030 TSLA will be trading near 1X sales."

and none of these companies are cracking the energy business the way Tesla is.

VW is probably only electric during laboratory emissions testing."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah, and to demonstrate OP's biggest flaw in due diligence it makes sense to repeat a similar ""market cap per sales"" analysis with Nokia from 2010:

Company | 2010 phone sales, units | market cap | market cap per unit sold
---|---|----|----|----
Nokia | 461,000,000 | $40b | $86
Apple | 40,000,000 | $300b | $7,500

So clearly in 2010 AAPL was hugely overvalued and NOK was hugely undervalued, which means you'd have earned a fortune shorting AAPL and buying NOK ... wait a minute. 🤔

Where OP has erred in their due diligence is:

- Market cap is forward looking, not backward looking. The market is valuing Tesla selling millions of vehicles within a few short years - not the half a million Teslas they managed to sell in 2020 despite a global pandemic.
- GM's value as a company isn't actually $83b, [it's $177b (Enterprise Value)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/key-statistics/). Shareholders only own about half of the company - claims against the other half are held by bond holders. Details matter, investment thesis calculations being 2x off matter a lot. 
- Tesla has unique advantages, with a widening gap to other carmakers: 5 years ago Tesla had maybe a 3 years advantage. Today they have more than 5 years competitive advantage. Those 5 years of competitive advantage was recently estimated by Pulitzer price winner auto journalist Dan Neil in the Wall Street Journal: [**""So when I say the ID.4 is five years behind the comparable Tesla, it’s not because I’m an Elon fanboy, a VW hater, or that I have anything to gain or lose personally. That is my best guess, based on my weeklong test drive of VW’s hot-from-the-oven, slightly underbaked strudel.**""](https://www.wsj.com/articles/volkswagen-id-4-should-tesla-worry-about-this-new-electric-rival-11614341784)
- The market is also pricing in the 20-25% cash margins that Tesla is achieving on auto sales. In 2020 they sold 500,000 vehicles and generated [**$5.9b cash from operations**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/cash-flow/) - that's $11.8k of cash earned per vehicle sold with an ASP of ~$50k - and under an insanely ambitious (read: temporarily operationally inefficient) hyper-growth expansion of +50% per year.
- [Tesla owns 79% of the EV market in the US](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-officially-decimates-us-ev-market/) - an unprecedented dominance in the auto market for the last ~100 years. The market will, cautiously, price in quasi-monopoly market advantages when valuing Tesla.
- Today TSLA is valued at only $680b, which is a small fraction of the markets they are targeting: the ~$5t automotive market, the ~5t+ autonomy market and the ~5t+ energy market. Apple is valued $2t, in large part based on the comparatively much smaller smartphone market that only has ~$0.5t sales per year. Tesla is targeting markets that are an order of magnitude larger than Apple. If they succeed, Tesla's valuation could easily exceed $10t. I.e. valuation will also consider the TAM (Total Addressable Market) of a company - which is uniquely huge for Tesla.

Anyway, the history lesson here is that today Apple is the $2t company, not Nokia - as forward looking Apple investors correctly guessed back in 2010, ignoring the poor P/E and sales/valuation ratios - and were rewarded for their correct analysis with 11x (1,000%) returns."

03/15/2021,stocks,Exactly
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah,  generac is kicking their ass on solar home batteries"
03/15/2021,stocks,Tesla has no advantage in any facet of their business. There are already better companies for solar and battery storage. There are already better cars... their one hope is autonomous driving.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Hah, that was my first thought. I bet OP would have wrote an article claiming that Amazon was dead in 2003 because there's no moat for selling books online."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes it is. Something like 80% of their operations is geared towards EV’s. If they were pivoting towards batteries and other products the price of the stock is still way too high. And once the big companies come out with their EV’s, Tesla will inevitably lose market share and the price will tumble. It’s highly overvalued."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Fundamentally it is. They can do a million things and be vertically integrated everywhere, but it's all for one reason, sell more cars. That's their business strategy."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I have 1 fun share in Tesla, but infrastructure transformations have always lead to growth and I can imagine Tesla playing a key part because it was one of the first to see the need. All the others may be copying, but only because they have to, not because they have a vision."
03/15/2021,stocks,Nor does it mean that it won’t also?
03/15/2021,stocks,It would be if OP wasn't clearly BSing. They aren't going to short shit.
03/15/2021,stocks,It's hardly as if the auto industry hasn't seen massive technology change... And adapted to it.. Over the 100+ years it has existed.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Why are you so certain they won't catch up? Toyota sells 10x each year what Tesla has on the road total at this point. They have resources well beyond Tesla's. They won't be first but that was never the objective. The objective is to come in fashionably late after Tesla has proved the demand and their cost to reach the same level are much lower, making them competitive. Just like they are doing with EV.

To think these companies are just standing by looking at Tesla and can't do anything about it is to take them for fools. Thats a huge mistake. 

Now all that said, I'm not saying Tesla won't be a big car manufacturer in the future. But with their current value, they need to be the dominant player by a lot. I don't see that happening."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I don't like these no one will catch up to them arguments, that argument could have been made about Nokia or bb in 2000 so yea I think buying a company that is valued at 1000x earnings on the basis that no one will catch them is a bad idea."
03/15/2021,stocks,That's the least of their concerns with that absurd thing.
03/15/2021,stocks,"You want to knock Ford for quality but overlook the fact that Tesla vehicles have windows, roofs and bumpers fall off? And that Tesla cars are rated as pretty crappy.   


My thoughts in a nutshell : The legacy automakers know how to mass produce vehicles and know what works and what doesn't, Tesla is learning the hard way. Tesla has a lead in EV and batteries but the lead is evaporating as other automakers move to EV. Can Tesla learn how to make a non-shitty product in the next 5 years? Maybe. Can the legacy automakers make an EV in the next 5 years? Yes, something like 400 new EVs are going to in the market in the next 5 years. 

 *JD Power scored Tesla vehicles the worst among 32 major brands in its annual quality study. It’s the first time that Tesla’s cars have been ranked by the influential customer survey now in its 34th year.*

03/15/2021,stocks,"That's not true lol fundamentals don't matter until they do, this notion that fundamentals don't matter is ridiculous"
03/15/2021,stocks,Michael Burry would like a word with you...
03/15/2021,stocks,Comparing Nokia to Apple is a false equivalency though. Apple's $300b market cap in 2010 wasn't based on iphone sales; it was iphones *and* macs and ipods and ipads - the latter 3 far surpassing iphone revenue in total.
03/15/2021,stocks,I mean like I disagree with the post too but are you really trying to compare a tech company with an automotive company. Cmon bro lol
03/15/2021,stocks,"Comparing tsla to apple is ridiculous on so many levels.

A more apt comparison from yesteryear might be Cisco.."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yo, that Mustang looks sick! Not gonna lie, I really like that car. Still, Tesla won't have a demand problem for years to come. There are so many ICE cars on the road that need to be replaced by EV's. Besides, the new lower pricing model that will come out soon will sell like hot cakes."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Which is bizarre, as from a dollars to features metric Generac's offering seems to be less capacity for more money."
03/15/2021,stocks,"> Tesla has no advantage in any facet of their business. There are already better companies for solar and battery storage.

Apple has no advantage in any facet of their business. There are already better companies for phones and computers."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I could see an apple like following for tesla, I think that will be their benefit over competitiors, people will want the full tesla package, solar roof, battery and car all working together."
03/15/2021,stocks,That's like saying Apple has no advantage in the smart phone industry. They aren't producing the most advanced phones or cutting edge software. They are top of the game because of branding and consistency. Tesla has branding down to the point where some people will call any electric car a Tesla like how any soda is a Coke. So far they have been fairly consistent with their products but that can change in an instant. I'm still confident on Tesla as a long term investment even if it is overvalued to buy right now (although it's becoming tempting to buy again now that's its dropped).
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm not saying your wrong but in 2003 Amazon was worth less than 5b tesla is worth 700b and is the 6th largest company in the world, the energy stuff and autonomous stuff is kinda priced in, I personally would compare tesla to the large cap dot com stocks not the small ones since tesla by market cap is absolutely not small"
03/15/2021,stocks,"AI my friend. Self driving cars. They have a godly amount of data captured and the streets mapped out. It’s not about what they are selling now, it’s what they are collecting for the future."
03/15/2021,stocks,"This ^^ 

They’re thinking about getting into mining...to sell more cars 

They’re developing solid state batteries....to sell more cars. 

They’re developing FSD software....to sell more cars. 

They’re getting into solar panels....to sell more cars. 

They’re developing huge batteries....to sell more cars.

At the end of the day we don’t call Apple a FinTech company because they have a credit card. It’s just a side hustle to sell more phones and apple products."
03/15/2021,stocks,I would actually argue that it’s flipped the other way around and they started by selling cars so that they can get to the point where they do a million things and be vertically integrated everywhere lol. Kind of like how Amazon started off just selling books.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I’m saying they won’t catch up in autonomous driving. Because that is almost impossible at this point. Waymo has been testing that for the last like 10(?) years and only has 30 million miles. Has Toyota even started? (I honestly don’t know). But starting behind almost 5 billion miles is too much. Tesla, according to what they have said, will have 10x the amount of cars with FSD  when they release their next update in April. So they have will be collecting data 10x faster than they are now, and already have almost 5 billion miles. Good luck to Toyota"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I meant in terms of autonomous driving miles. 4 billion is a lot more than 30 million, and Tesla is only going to grow at a faster rate once they release FSD"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I never said they don’t matter. I said they’re not *as important* of a metric as they used to be. With the advent of retail trading, people aren’t going to spend a week looking at a company’s fundamentals when they can buy and sell within the span of minutes."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Investing in Tesla also means you believe in their ability to potentially become more than just a car company. Licensing out FSD software. Robotaxi network. Solar panels & storage. VTOL.  
  
I invest for the future and I believe Tesla has the vision of where we are headed. They’ve done nothing yet to make me not believe they are always looking forward and have the talent to make it happen."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Today Tesla is still basically valued as an auto company - albeit with tech margins.

Wait until valuations include tech revenue expansion models - which Tesla's self-driving technology will allow ..."
03/15/2021,stocks,">Comparing tsla to apple is ridiculous on so many levels.

I was comparing **Nokia** to Apple.

Comparing Tesla to Apple can be done, but it would be imperfect, because Tesla's target markets are ~30x larger than Apple's target markets.

So in many ways it's an apples to oranges comparison.

But yeah, we can think of Tesla as selling $40,000+ ""iPhones on wheels"", and scale everything up.

>A more apt comparison from yesteryear might be Cisco..

CSCO is primarily active in the networking switch market, which is only $0.03t/year. Unfortunately they reached saturation in that market at around the year 2000, when the Internet bubble collapsed.

There's literally a factor of 1,000 difference between the size of the target markets Cisco and Tesla are growing into ... 🤦

Tesla is still 10 years away from saturation, even at today's very high growth rate. You couldn't pick any worse comparison..."
03/15/2021,stocks,They are having a demand problem and in Germany they are already puking some shit with this calling up customers who bought six months ago to buy new all over again. Need that credit money from the govt.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Generac already has the network built out for distribution and installation.  I shopped both for myself this spring,  and generac had more offerings."
03/15/2021,stocks,What was Apple's market cap when they had less than 1% market share?
03/15/2021,stocks,"True... but I would still thats a terrible Comp. Contracted production of consumer goods/services do not equal cars/solar panels/battery storage.   


True... but I would still that's a terrible Comp. Contracted production of consumer goods/services does not equal cars/solar panels/battery storage.   
GigaFactory, meanwhile, the OEM's already have factories and just need to convert...Additionally, they will never have a majority share in China and are very quickly hemorrhaging what minor market share they had in Europe. In N.A. , it will be a slower transition and they will not take the majority share there either... lets be honest about that too."
03/15/2021,stocks,I’ll give you that. But I don’t think it’s gonna be  too too long until Ford and GM catch up to them.
03/15/2021,stocks,"It's all a question of ressources and scale. Tesla collected that data over years by having people drive their car right? What if Toyota puts 20x as many cars in their testing program? Then it takes them much less time to get the same amount of data. 

Plus data collecting isn't the end all be all. The way the system analyses and uses that data matters too. It's possible to get a lot better with less data by making it more efficient. It's very common for bigger companies to wait for smaller players (funny to say when we look at market cap) to advance a technology before jumping in and doing it quicker and cheaper. 

Again, I don't think they will beat Tesla to the punch. That is not the objective. Like they didn't beat them to the EV market. They don't need to and frankly don't want to. But to think that a company that sells 10M cars per year and has 55B cash on their balance sheet can't catch up is to think them foolish. They aren't. And even if Toyota somehow screwed it up, Volkswagen also sells close to 10M cars and has 46B on their balance sheet. And Honda has only ""only"" 25B, etc. The resources they can throw at this when they feel the time is right or when the demand is proven will speed things up considerably."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Of course tesla is ahead but driving miles aren't everything, they are important however but not everything, and it is definitely possible that Google or gm or someone else can catch up, in fact most reviewers like gms software more than teslas, I just wouldn't buy a stock on the assumption that they will always be ahead."
03/15/2021,stocks,"First retail has an impact on certain small cap stocks like gme, but on the overall market we acount for far less than 1% of the market. fundamentals do matter as much as they did 30 years ago, fundamentals only don't matter in bubbles, saying fundamentals don't matter as much is as ridiculous as saying they don't matter at all."
03/15/2021,stocks,Tesla already smashed past automotive valuations with a lot of tech margin already behind it 😂
03/15/2021,stocks,"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Your tesla TAMs are little more than a pipedream right now.  94% of revenues last year were from auto sales, they barely have the tip of a toe in anything else that is currently monetizing let alone profitable.

Apple isn't and never was just a cell phone company, and in 2010 specifically they had huge Mac, iPad and iPod sales.  All, along with cell phones, were a burgeoning market that didn't exist for long before and therefore were wide open.  The auto industry is not in any way comparable.

Cisco exploded because they were the leader in an overhyped new tech... Exactly what is happening with Tesla."
03/15/2021,stocks,"This is no indication for a demand problem. I mean just think about it... What do you think are they doing with the old car?

What they are doing is actually super smart. The customer gets a newer model for free, while Tesla can resell the old one for a profit and both sites share the environmental bonus. 

I am german btw and I read the article."
03/15/2021,stocks,Let's also remember that the time in which that was was when computers were just becoming available to homes.
03/15/2021,stocks,"But they can’t deploy and untested system on people’s cars.. you need hundreds of million of miles to be considered safe under the autonomous driving levels. Also it matters immensely how you use your resources. Volkswagen for example just announced a plan to build 6 new factories over 10 years for $30 billion, and the TOTAL GWH that they will produce is 250 GWH... Tesla does that with its gigaberlin factory alone, which costs $4-5 billion."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think it is everything. You can’t just write code to teach a car to drive itself and it’s perfect. you have to collect data. The more data you collect, the more “experience” your system has. The more situations the system has encountered, such as weather conditions, traffic laws, signs, all that stuff. Having the most data is certainly a major advantage, probably the biggest a company could have in that area.  I’m not saying buy Tesla cause it’s the best and no one will ever beat them. Just stating facts in terms of autonomous driving, they are way ahead and climbing faster than anyone else right now."
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you look at published TSLA valuations by leading Wall Street analysts then you'll see that with the exception of ARK, they are all valuing Tesla's auto business, and scale revenue with cars sold.

I.e. basically auto valuation."
03/15/2021,stocks,"> 94% of revenues **last year** were from auto sales

I highlighted your primary mistake: you are backward looking instead of forward looking. 

Stock price fair value primarily correlates with all expected future cash flows (probability discounted to the present day), not past cash flows.

> Your tesla TAMs are little more than a pipedream right now. 

Here's Piper Sandler's forward looking research report that is estimating $1,200 fair value for TSLA at the present day:

> [""The Definitive Guide to Investing in Tesla, 1st Edition (Increasing PT to $1,200)""](https://piper2.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=e29642c1-102d-4e2d-80e0-bf65a37df967&mime=pdf)

They are estimating that by 2030 Tesla Energy will represent 20%-30% of Tesla's revenue - a significant shift in revenue source. I expect a faster shift.

We'll see. 🤠"

Listen, theres alot of merit to be had in looking for undervalued stocks, lots of investors do it make money. But looking specifically for stocks with high short interest is a pretty bad way of going about it. Im not saying its impossible to find gems, but by looking at shorted stocks youre literally selecting for companies with shitty/shakey fundamentals.

03/15/2021,stocks,So what you’re saying is if everyone set their buys to $700.64 and sells to $700.65 and nobody budged a penny?
03/15/2021,stocks,it’s value on the ticker wouldn’t move and your account balance would remain the same. however since we are taking about what makes organizations buy and sell having an easter you couldn’t liquidate is VERY unappealing to everyone. now if it isn’t trading because 100% of all shares are being held that would cause potential buyers to bid higher and higher until someone caved and sold. what happens after that first share is sold is anyone’s guess if people panic sale or keep holding. but there is no way of knowing since this can’t actually happen to a public company unless the SEC interferes(to my knowledge).
03/15/2021,stocks,"it would stay the same. There are 2 kinds of stocks don't know the correct terms but, I'll go with dividend and potential... dividend stocks pay shareholders money from their profit, potential stocks are usually negative revenue stocks that are looking for money to eventually be positive revenue. Potential stocks can make people money off what people think the potential of the company even if it maintains a negative balance sheet and is hemorrhaging money something like TSLA can explode because people believe in it's potential. Dividend stocks don't really have much growth potential (I.E> phone carriers), and give out dividends on the money they're making, so if you hold the stock they give you money. Basically."

03/15/2021,stocks,Walk into the boardroom and provide logical constructive feedback. See how that works out for ya.
03/15/2021,stocks,"You’re going to get kicked out bruv. 

Are you really this dissociated that you think you can walk into a company with your 3 shares and start pitching some ideas?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Wait, what? You're the one who's talking about walking into a boardroom.

Alls I'm saying is as long as a company has any value on their books, your shares will be worth something even if hypothetically no one wants to buy your shares on the market."
03/15/2021,stocks,"It’s worth 0 if you can’t sell it.

Did you not get my boardroom example? It doesn’t have worth if you can’t make changes in the company"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Ah okay, I see what you mean there.
Let’s say you and ten of your buddies started a business. You have a small stake but still a stake. If you’re saying that the contract showing your ownership is worthless, then I guess I can’t argue with you. It should be worth something even if there is no sales and just some inventory on the books. 

But I get where you’re coming from."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Bullish on it for these reasons:

1. COVID going away meaning more people traveling meaning more demand for CHPT's system.
2. Long-term macro trend is showing increased market share for EVs
3. Governments are encouraging EV purchases compared to fossil fuel cars.
4. Customers who use CHPT's chargers give favorable reviews of it and they say they like it; easy to use; convenient; charging app is good etc.
5. Quick ability to scale due to the independent-owner model"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Is best case scenario a forward PS ratio of 35?  That's steep.  Carabiner and rope steep.

Back of the napkin: 

* Their growth plans call for growing their network by 19x in 2025.  All else equal, if we 19x their forecasted 2021 revenue that gives them a PS of 1.8 which is good enough to justify almost doubling the stock price. 
* Let's be optimistic and say they 19x the network **and** increase revenue per charger giving them another 100% upside. If you have to wait for these plans to be realized and the stock to respond accordingly, then that's 15% - 22% annual return

Not bad.  But this is a risky growth play so I would want more yield than that. It all depends on if the market gets confident on the growth plans and increases the price well before 2025."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Bear reason. What happens when battery tech gets 400-500 miles per charge (Within 5 years) and the consumer never needs to charge when out and about? People in apartments will use machines like charge point but the majority of people who drive a lot of miles live in houses and can just charge at home. I’ve made good money from chargepoint (bought @15, sold @40), they’re the industry leader and have a good product but I worry about technology advances capping their growth. 

Is there a compelling reason to invest in your own chargepoint station at your own home? If they can get a large home adoption rate then that would be a big boost."
03/15/2021,stocks,Bullish but it depends on the USA infrastructure bill supporting EV charging networks through subsidies or tax breaks.
03/15/2021,stocks,It’s gonna die. Go SEEL
03/15/2021,stocks,Well put.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Are EV batteries really less than 5 years from getting 400-500 miles? If this is true there is another angle to look at this. According to recent surveys, the main reason most people won’t buy an EV as their next vehicle is because of the amount of miles they (on average) get before charging.  The number most people would want to see was shy of 400 so this would be great news in the aspect of EV sales which would greatly increase the value of CHPT. You do make some good points though."
03/15/2021,stocks,">Bear reason. What happens when battery tech gets 400-500 miles per charge (Within 5 years) and the consumer never needs to charge when out and about?

Easy. Most of chargepoint's sales are in at-home chargers you mount on the wall of your garage."
03/15/2021,stocks,You think the company that currently owns over 70% of the worldwide charging network is going to die? Explain why please.
03/15/2021,stocks,What’s going to die ?
03/15/2021,stocks,Simple answer it’s gonna die because of Joe

03/15/2021,stocks,"Love it long term, a lot of foreign stocks are OTC so I wouldn’t worry about it. Just don’t expect it to moon for a while. This is a patient play. Do not expect to reach the old prices because the stock was heavily diluted. But if market cap is your guide, $3 a share is a realistic level it could return to if recovery is real. Nearly double from here."
03/15/2021,stocks,I only have 160 shares. I wish I had bought more at $1.38 but didn't have available funds at the time. I think it will be a nice slow gain all year. I don't think it will get back to $8+ but what if it gets to half its old price?
03/15/2021,stocks,I think it's only a pink sheet because they trade on the London Stock Exchange. They don't have a ticker on any of the US exchanges.
03/15/2021,stocks,Are they still going to close a facility over the summer?
03/15/2021,stocks,I grabbed 90k shares over last 2 months.  Dilution x4.    Won't return to previous highs easily
03/15/2021,stocks,"Couple quick thoughts.

1- RYCEY took on huge amounts of debt and diluted their shares something like 3x or 4x.

2 - RYCEY is not going anywhere

3 - RYCEY is positioned well for the space industry ""Look at their compact reactors / new spiffy jet engines""

4 - Why the fuck would you invest in a company to the tune of 14K and not understand why its a pink sheet? For the love of jesus its not on the NYSE exchange.

5 - My crystal ball says RYCEY will see 2.50 within 6 months.

03/15/2021,stocks,"I've been watching them but don't see much upside in a reasonable timeframe compared to others I'm holding.  Maybe 3Q they'll look better.  Currently I'm holding $ACDVF and $UAL and they're doing well.

I'm also watching $SPR but they're high now."
03/15/2021,stocks,"It seems to be a hot topic on Reddit in various investing groups the past month IMO. I’m not interested.  But I agree on aerospace, most of my money is invested in SPCE right now."
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah a ton which is why it’s nearing an ATL. But with vaccination going so well and the airline industry bouncing back I personally think this might be a huge opportunity to get in while it’s low. I’m just honestly curious why it’s a OTC pink sheet though.
03/15/2021,stocks,Been trying to find an article to confirm but I’ve only seen one as of early February suggesting they will. I’m curious if air traffic keeps up if they actually will do so
03/15/2021,stocks,"Dang that’s huge you’re definitely in a better position than me, I’m only in for 10k shares. So you’re not concerned that it’s a pink sheet stock?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I’m still kind of a noob, only been trading for a year. I’ve seen to be weary of pink sheet stocks. The other pink sheet I got into was PyroGenesis (now pyr) but I rode that beast from .50 a share. I also know that rolls Royce is a lot more established that PyroGenesis so if they went onto a major exchange I just didn’t understand why Rolls Royce didn’t/hasn’t."
03/15/2021,stocks,My 5k shares @ 1.61 likes your valuation sir!
03/15/2021,stocks,I’m in UAL at 30 and AAL at 11. Also in SpCE and BA. I still think this might be a nice play long term though
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah I have some in SPCE too
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I believe that's a tipping point. I'm thinking if they close, then a good buy in would be right after they re-open."
03/15/2021,stocks,It's only pink because it's not NYSE. Plus I doubt the UK would let this company fail.
03/15/2021,stocks,I know if it hits 1.30 again I'll buy more.
03/15/2021,stocks,RYCEY has a deal with SPCE

Try taking these to your grandfather's broker and see what they have to say"
03/15/2021,stocks,Keep us updated; I'd love to know what you find out
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm likely going to need a lawyer. There is quite a bit of assets in the trust that are still unclaimed. I don't believe distribution was done properly after my grandparents passed. I was a beneficiary of those assets but not the assets they inherited from my great grandparents. I remember being a kid and finding envelopes full of cash in their filing cabinet. They were dividend payments they received and kept on hand. I know they were killing it on some investments. They passed in 1997, so that REALLY makes me wonder about those dividends now...."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Shell, break-even of $40. And is doing the most of all oil supermajors in the energy transition. The dividend cut scared people alway, but that cut is what's gonna give them the edge in the future"

03/15/2021,stocks,"Purely anecdotal experience here, but Exxon always lags from a technology adoption perspective. They'll wait until somebody's been doing something successfully for years before they decide to evaluate for themselves and see if they want to do it. Having seen how things work on their operations side, I wouldn't expect them to be anywhere near leading the pack when it comes to going green."
03/15/2021,stocks,also Buffet.. just switch to Chevron
03/15/2021,stocks,CVX
03/15/2021,stocks,I hold chevron. Will probably buy some Exxon when stimulus lands in my account.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I like Exxon precisely because it's not a green play. I bought them during the Covid crash but honestly, I don't like oil because of OPEC."
03/15/2021,stocks,White people problems
03/15/2021,stocks,"Shell is a great long hold, I think moving forward I'm gonna trim away at my exxon and slowly average into my other energy stocks and chevron. Shell has a very good brand for their performance fuel as well and a lot of people will only put shell in their cars. They seem undervalued just by book numbers, but I will do some dd and will probably put some money into them. They've been on my watchlist but I'm not in a crazy rush to initiate a whole lot more energy positions because of the run they've had."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah they have done really well, I actually took a chance today to average up a bit on them."
03/15/2021,stocks,"With all technological advancements, it is prudent to stay informed and knowledgeable, but risky to be early adopter lest you are left holding a useless boondoggle that failed to disrupt anything but the early adopters. Maintenance costs on “renewables” while progressives tout “job creation”, fundamentally have slimmer ROI from a capital performance perspective than something that requires fewer humans to operate. O&G isn’t going anywhere anytime soon unless the world population accepts lower standards of living, which put bluntly will not happen."
03/15/2021,stocks,Don’t think it’s to pricey now?
03/15/2021,stocks,"That's a good way to look at it. My main concern is the long term mainly because oil is overall a declining industry , I like where oil is at right now, but with Biden in office I feel companies like exxon won't receive much love. I love the value of the company though, but I feel it doesn't have belong in my long portfolio and I should take the gains and run."
03/15/2021,stocks,You sound fun
03/15/2021,stocks,Hell yeah! Love to hear it
03/15/2021,stocks,"I should caveat that by noting it won’t happen as long as the “Me” generation keep a voting majority. They live for today, not their children’s or grandchildren’s tomorrow."
03/15/2021,stocks,"i do, the OP himself wants to choose between one of those 2, so thats why i said Chevron, for me price is pretty high"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm more optimistic about oil. It's cheap energy with tons of byproducts. The technology is unbelievable at this point with literally next to no limit on supply. 

I've been hearing about it going obsolete for about 2 decades now. I remember people talking about peak oil (which is almost absurdly funny looking back) over a decade ago. It's just noise 

Except 2020 Covid and 2008 real estate crash, oil consumption keeps hitting all time highs. Obama tried to regulate oil and capped off shore drilling, all it did was make oil companies hit ath 

It is theoretically possible that Biden will do something nuts, like tax oil at 50%, but I don't think he is stupid enough to do that.

Again, the main reason I might sell my Exxon is because of opec. I like comodities but only if traded on the free market. I'm not overly bullish or bearish"
03/15/2021,stocks,My mom thinks so
03/15/2021,stocks,"I had read somewhere that there's hemp plastic being developed as well

Forget the high or medical value because once hemp is toyed with and researched enough it'll probably have a few hundred uses

Strange to think this plant which has been growing illegally as a wild weed is only now being researched and marketed for products besides hemp bracelets and bale twine that was previously available"
03/15/2021,stocks,$IP - They might have exposure to hemp paper. Take a closer look and find out
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm curious as to what the investment thesis would be behind this, since hemp paper is neither economically nor environmentally better than paper based on wood pulp."
03/15/2021,stocks,Hemp is an annual plant rather than a tree which takes much longer to mature. This means a great deal economically. The biomass that hemp can generate in one year is waaaaaay more than any tree-sourced paper pulp.
03/15/2021,stocks,Yes it is? Where do u get this information?
03/15/2021,stocks,"I did a research study a couple years back regarding the commercialization of hemp paper, since I believed that it must be better than wood too and that the only reason it wasn't used currently was due to legalization issues surrounding the use of cannabis plants (even though cannabis bred for fiber production is much different than that used for medicinal/recreational purposes).

&#x200B;

It turned out that the production of paper was much more complicated than I had initially realized and there were a variety of factors that go into the overall determination of economic/environmental benefits. Seeded forest growth for the specific production of wood pulp used in paper production is a highly optimized process due to its extensive use for the past 100+ years in a low margin industry, and it is not immediately obvious that hemp provides a significant improvement. I am not saying that hemp fiber production is worthless, just that it isn't easy to make a blanket statement regarding its benefit over wood without extensive consideration of all of the factors involved in industrial paper production."
03/15/2021,stocks,Based on your picks I think you would like PTF. It's a tech momentum ETF that has gone up massively and I hardly ever see it mentioned here.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I currently use my margin availability to invest in high annual average return ETFs, which will almost always outpace my margin interest rate. That being said, I picked QQQ, PBW, SMH, and ESPO.


Reasons I picked each:

QQQ (Nasdaq) - For tech.

PBW (Green Energy) - Current administration.

SMH (Chips) - Current/future tech/AI demands.

ESPO (Gaming) - Untapped potential on licensing of gaming IPs for traditional entertainment (movies/tv).

*Thoughts are my own and shall not be taken as financial advice."
03/15/2021,stocks,Spy and ark are my favorites
03/15/2021,stocks,"My ETF horses for the next 10 years or so are:

1) VTI

2) ICLN (clean energy)

3) ARKG (genomics/disruptive healthcare)

4) ESPO (video gaming & esports)"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Me personally...

VTI/QQQJ/ARKK/ARKF/QCLN
65/15/10/5/5"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I like arkf. Great upside potential, somewhat overlooked compared to the other ark ETFs"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I like VTI as the core position. IMO You could consider 10-15% international (non-US) exposure given relative underperformance in recent years. Some country specific markets are likely to mean revert and also be less correlated to the rest of your portfolio. For example, iShares EWS, EWU, in particular. I’d avoid all ARK funds. That’s played out, they are too large and now unmanageable for outperformance. And a lot of downside risk in the next two years. I’d consider something like the Baron Opportunity Fund instead. Also could consider Russell index etfs like IWM or IWB. Of course, all just my opinions, not financial advice."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I like your approach and mine is similar. As far as the QQQ variant, I have moved about 10% to QQQJ. I believe that fund will outperform QQQ over the next few years."
03/15/2021,stocks,MSOS too
03/15/2021,stocks,"I doubt any of those ETF's will outperform VTI.

So just buy VTI."
03/15/2021,stocks,Following this
03/15/2021,stocks,"icln, qcln and tan are great clean energy etf too."
03/15/2021,stocks,just do 100% VTI
03/15/2021,stocks,Really interesting post thanks 👌
03/15/2021,stocks,"Is the VTI your low volatility ETF? 

I come from the world where value ETFs or banks, tobacco and utilities are the low volatility component."
03/15/2021,stocks,Fairly new to this. What's the big difference between PBW and QCLN?
03/15/2021,stocks,"I recently invested in $LOUP and $ARKQ. These ETF’s cover autonomous vehicles, AI, 3d printing, VR, and similar technology. I think these are both great long term holds for the next few decades, and I plan on holding these until I retire."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Thanks for posting this.  I have some homework to do on these funds now. 

It may be a bit risky for you but I am very much in on MOON, which focuses mainly on disruptive technologies.  

I also really like YOLO as my Marijuana ETF, as they are investing on a lot of the growing supply chain companies and technologies and not just grow operators.

Edit: autocorrect"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I made these picks for the 5-10 year term:

- iShares Global clean Energy

- Lyxor Disruptive technology (closest thing to the ARK etf for an European investor

- SMH

- MSCI Asia ex Japan

- iShares Health care and innovation.


Except for SMH, on which I am gaining peanuts, the rest are bleeding. I bought them just before the rise in yields.

Long term I expect them to perform well. My belief is that both the USA and the EU will invest in green energy and helth care technology to prevent the next pandemic. The the exposure to Asia is to diversify and to exploit China growth."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Pave has an odd mix of holdings. Several existing train operators, for instance. Maybe they think there's some synergy because basic materials need to be delivered? It still looks kind of wonky and dulutes the concept. So I avoid it as an infrastructure play."
03/15/2021,stocks,What would you guys recommend as someone who can't hold any kind of aviation related securities due to conflicts of interest?
03/15/2021,stocks,"VUG - 40%

QQQJ - 30%

ARKK - 30%"
03/15/2021,stocks,"MOTO. Autonomous vehicles and smart transportation. Buy and HODL. Same goes for LIT and BOTZ. 

I’m hoping to retire on these."
03/15/2021,stocks,Capital Group Global Equity may be an ETF that would interest you. Also an ETF focused on environmental technology might be good going forward into the next decade? I've had good success with NEI Environmental Leaders
03/15/2021,stocks,"my expense ratio max is 0.09 to be considered a low cost index fund for me. I have XIC, XUU and VFV on the TSX."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Do yourself a favor and do 90% VTWAX. Chasing top fund mangers, sector specific selection does not work over long periods of time. Also, the more funds you have , more is the urge to tinker with your portfolio which inevitably results in bad decisions. Head over to r/Bogleheads for more evidence."
03/15/2021,stocks,"When younger and savings are smaller compared to income, I like a higher risk allocation that slowly shifts to a lower and lower percentage as your portfolio grows. 

Personally, I consider QQQ/XLK and SMH/SOXX core holdings and not part of the clean energy, sports betting, MJ, and ARK speculative segment that should have a controlled allocation percent."
03/15/2021,stocks,This is just my opinion but I think a lot of the infrastructure boost has been priced in.
03/15/2021,stocks,Would you pick VT over VTI? I hesitate...
03/15/2021,stocks,"Majority VTI or VOO (or both?) and then invest the rest in a sector you believe will grow. If you're interested in ARK, lookup ARKG and ARKF. For me personality, I like LIT since I believe the demand for lithuim, batteries and EVs overall will increase in the long term."
03/15/2021,stocks,You thought about a few % on weed/cbd etfs? My weed ETFs been steadily doing great. There was a stretch of days where it absolutely tanked because it got memed to hell by wsb weeks prior but it has recovered since then. The etf MJ been amazing.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Consider a small cybersecurity allocation (<10%) with an ETF like BUG or WCBR. The sector is likely to be volatile in the short-term since a lot of  the popular names (CRWD, ZS, OKTA) are already richly valued even with the recent sell-off."
03/15/2021,stocks,50/50 VTI/QQQM
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm looking at SDIV - it's still significantly below its January 2020 level because, being globally diversified, many of the companies in it didn't get US slush-fund stimulus and thus it is experiencing a more natural but unmistakable recovery. It could realistically see a 25-40% growth over the next three years (more if the EU ever does stimulus...not impossible to imagine, though it would likely be less than 0.5 trillion and it is far from a done deal), and it specifically holds dividend-paying companies."
03/15/2021,stocks,"You should add some TQQQ. Tech is the future, why not get a triple leveraged ETF on it?"
03/15/2021,stocks,Added to the watchlist!
03/15/2021,stocks,I like a non zero allocation to this fund as well. It will continue to outperform in the kind of bull market we currently have (and I'll reevaluate when that starts to change).
03/15/2021,stocks,I like the idea behind ESPO but its underlying holdings aren't really big on the esports scene. The biggest Esports companies are private currently and I think the real value lies there
03/15/2021,stocks,QQQJ. Nice. I’m hoping to jump in there sometime in the next 90 days.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Agreed. This is the only ARK I seriously considered, and it’s ~ 9% of my portfolio."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Don't you think if someone's timeline is 5-10 years, owning ARK fund will only give them gains? New to investing just trying to learn.

Edit: 5-10% of the portfolio like OP"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Great ""opinions"" thank you. I'm not sure why I put ARK on there. To be perfectly honest, I think they are too hyped. I like my investments to fly under the radar."
03/15/2021,stocks,Thank you for the opinion! I will look into QQQJ.
03/15/2021,stocks,Ya that’s what I’m leaning towards. Maybe leave 10% towards funds I feel confident in.
03/15/2021,stocks,Same

03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes. In the grand scheme, I understand that VTI pulls smaller cap in as well making it slightly more volatile. I guess volatility is all relative."

03/15/2021,stocks,I agree. do you like MLPX for infrastructure?
03/15/2021,stocks,Those seem a bit too emerging for me. Not to say they won't be good plays but I would like to tie my volatility to more developed systems such as infrastructure and even green energy.
03/15/2021,stocks,"While I think you bring up a great strategy, do you have direct evidence you can link me to about sector specific selections not working in the long term? I won't likely tie myself to a single sector if it underperforms. r/Bogleheads brings up great points but they also suffer from confirmation bias."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Anything weed related I put into my ""fun"" Etrade brokerage account. While I think there are gains to be had, I'm looking for moderate volatility at most in this ETF portfolio."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm looking at the 5-year chart on MJ and it's anything but amazing.

Recently okay.

But before that it was garbage.

Super volatile and then just tanking. The covid crash looks like a small blip at the bottom of its dive. 

And there is by no means any guarantee that the federal government will rescind the laws against the stuff.

Short-term momentum play maybe. Long term I would plan to bounce out of it while the vote was happening."

03/15/2021,stocks,"It's certainly high risk high reward, so only gains isn't a sure fire bet. Past performance doesnt guarantee future results"
03/15/2021,stocks,">. I like my investments to fly under the radar.

Put your money in a CD."
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you like the underlying stocks and investment strategy of an ARK fund, it doesn't need to fly under the radar. Also, I would almost consider ARKF non-speculative. FinTech is highly profitable and growing fast."

I mean yeah, a far right McDonalds homunculus with special needs was president and was appointing AG's that thought they talked to Jesus who told them weed was the devil's grass

Decriminalization is extremely realistic, and states legalizing will happen more and more.

MJ isn't my focus at all (not extremely interested in large Canada holdings, was meme'd) but they definitely will benefit"
03/15/2021,stocks,"QQQJ focuses more on companies that the ETF managers believe will be the big players in the future.  QQQ is what the big players are now.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Honestly, the fact that Cathie Wood bases her decisions off a belief that god has anointed certain stocks is a huge turn off for me."
03/15/2021,stocks,Thank you for the link. I think that's a fair criticism. That's why I'm leaning less towards past success and more towards sectors that I think are emerging but less risky. I'm going to have a friend who works for Vanguard review this and if he says all VTI/VTWAX/VOO etc. then I'm gonna do what he says.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah, she doesn't do that.  That's the misinterpreted reddit ""version""."
03/15/2021,stocks,"That’s really not her belief system. ARK is very transparent with its investment decisions, you should consider reading them even if you aren’t buying their funds. 

Ultimately, ARK funds derive their value from their underlying holdings. It’s a pretty silly idea to build a growth portfolio and not include them, but do you."
03/15/2021,stocks,Bruh have you seen Square? Someone's anointed that shit lmao

03/15/2021,stocks,"“It’s not so much about me and my promise. It’s about allocating capital to God’s creation in the most innovative and creative way possible.” That's a direct quote. 

This is my personal choice. I have chosen to not invest because I don't like people who claim to follow the teachings of Jesus yet completely ignore everything he said."
03/15/2021,stocks,How is it 'silly?' Everyone has their own risk tolerance. ARK funds can be quite volatile; some people don't want to see their portfolio blood red. It's also unclear whether ARK will or will not be able to beat the market over the coming decades. There's a chance her picks might be the wrong ones. I'm an ARK bull but your comment was silly if anything.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I've also read the issues of liquidity with her funds. I could be completely wrong, that's fine. I just have chosen to not invest in her funds for personal reasons."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I’m with you. However, I do invest in ARKF. FinTech is solid and not going anywhere but up over the next 10 years. However, I bought before I heard her comments, and it’s stopped me from investing in any of her other products. Still, I don’t plan to sell ARKF for a loooong time."
03/15/2021,stocks,You hit the nail on the head. ARK has been an awesome play and could continue to be that. That’s not the level of volatility I am looking for in this portfolio.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Keep researching. Lot of bad info out there. Liquidity is not a problem for ETFs.

Edit: and if by liquidity issues, you mean the liquidity of shares of some of the smaller businesses she invests in, then you should probably look more closely at some of her trades. I think, from her alluding that she really likes volatility, that she actually uses large inflows and outflows to slyly reallocate and take advantage of when people sell off her funds, making it stronger each time."
03/15/2021,stocks,That's fine. Maybe you'll make a ton more money than me investing in ARK funds. Maybe you'll lose a ton. That's not the point of this portfolio.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes very promising long term. My position is to hold for the next several years. However, it seems that wall street is not as kind or optimistic. For the past several months, any time they had good news, it did nothing tot their price."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Bear case will be earnings.

I'll take the bet that BB will get there especially with all the catalysts in the past year. Some might not."
03/15/2021,stocks,"BB is a fantastic long term investment. BB's products are still growing, and revenue will be only ramping up from here. BB's software products Alert, AtHoc, and IVY are all going to be producing new revenue streams, and I do believe that BB is getting better at sales and making additional money off their current clients. The settlement amount from FB will be a nice surprise as well that I think will cause a big jump up for the SP, whenever that is discovered comes out."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'll admit I was brand new to buying stocks (401k only previously) in january when I bought into the hyped up stuff like AMC, GME and BB. I sold my GME for nice gains, AMC for a loss (only 3 shares luckily as I spent everything else on BB) and i'm still holding the bag big time on BB. I was going to cut my losses and just accept defeat but once I looked into what the company is actually doing I decided to just stick it out long term. 

I think this is going to be a great hold long term. It did teach me a lesson to not buy into FOMO and that has helped me make much better buying decisions."
03/15/2021,stocks,Long Term play for me. They always had better software then hardware. Glad they are focused on their strength.
03/15/2021,stocks,This is like this subs favorite stock with everyone posting something bullish or about how great BB is everyday. Did you really need to ask this 😂😆😂
03/15/2021,stocks,Having watched it a while my opinion is this one is a sideways trader regardless of news.
03/15/2021,stocks,"What's the consensus on its earnings coming up? Are they going to be dismal?

03/15/2021,stocks,I think they have a lot of good partnerships and deals in the pipeline. I don’t expect them to bear fruit for 1-2 years however (if ever) but given the drop earlier this year I figured I’d pick some up as a long term investment for some of my portfolio.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Not a popular opinion on Reddit, but I’m not bullish. Revenues are flat or falling. Almost all revenues come from patents, or patent lawsuits. Their car OS from QNX they have done very little with and have had trouble monetizing despite having bought it 10 years ago. The one bright spot is Ivy which they are building on Amazon Web Services. They are expected to pull in $1 billion a year for it by 2028, while all other revenues continue to fall. At a current $4.5ish billion market cap, that does not attract me to pull in $1 billion in 7 years."

03/15/2021,stocks,"It's an ok stock. On the one hand, it's got little debt and the current assets outweigh the current liabilities, meaning significant immediate liquidity. However, it's got limited cashflow compared to debt, its trading at nine tmes its cash, and its trading at over 3 times its book value. It's ok, but a little overpriced."

I don't buy it. People are overhyping their software. QNX and IVY are neat, but aren't revolutionary by any sense and they have some big competition (Microsoft’s Windows Embedded Automotive, AGL, not to mention the [*dozens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_real-time_operating_systems) of other RTOS's out there).

So yea BB has some neat potential but it isn't this mind-blowing thing and actual industry vets probably realize this too which is why the stock barely moves."
03/15/2021,stocks,"No one thinks Blackberry is a failing phone company. *They already failed at that.* When is the last time you have seen a blackberry phone? The failure on the phone front has come and gone.

03/15/2021,stocks,Been buying slowly since the beginning of this month. Abt to cop some more to make my position counts nice and round.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I averaged up on leverage and sold at a wash when I was close to being margin called. 

What I should have done is buy at $5 or $6 when I first started watching it, and should have gotten more volume instead of waiting to buy around $10 and averaging up when it dipped at $20 and $15. I should have left it alone after the initial buy. Peace of mind comes with a low initial buy-in and higher volume. Averaging up on leverage is dumb, so I did it with two other stocks as well. They were good buys until I averaged up on leverage. If you ever want to wreck a good investment, average up on leverage.

Now I'm averaging down on Empower Clinics with gains from HelloPal and waiting for Reddit to go public. No more averaging up. No more leverage. It's all about getting volume in undervalued companies and chilling. The entire world is deeeeply in debt. I want to be ready when everything tanks. No more leverage. No more averaging up."
03/15/2021,stocks,They are in my “long term” brokerage which is Fidelity. I think it’ll eventually do well but probably will take them 2-5 years imo.

03/15/2021,stocks,"It is a meme stock.   

BlackBerry isn't a phone company. They produce vehicle systems (QNX platform), and Endpoint (Security/Device Management). QNX used to be big in vehicles, but it is getting squished by cheaper systems that are also cheaper to develop for (namely Linux Real Time and or Android for UI), it is slowly shrinking. Endpoint has good recurring subscriptions, but I wouldn't expect significant *growth*, it isn't the leader in the sector for security or device management, but it won't be disappearing for tens of years minimum.   

BlackBerry is likely a good buy, but over a 10+ year time span, with modest returns that could beat VTI/VOO. People keep buying it as a meme stock, expecting large movement in <12 months, then selling because it is boring. Anyone who claims BlackBerry will grow ""because EV"" should set off your bullshit detector, the QNX suite doesn't care if it is running on EV or gas."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'll tell you this. I invested in Blackberry back in 2013 thinking it was a long term play then. I finally sold this January. 7 years and it went up from $8 to $12 (there were some higher levels in between, but I didn't sell then). 

It's not a good play. Trust me, I thought it was and for 8 years saw nothing. If they couldn't figure out a long-term strategy in 8 years, why are these next 8 years any different?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I picked up BB when they were oversold and the closing price was super low a few months ago, long before they were on WSB.  I think they had news about a military contract back then.  The stock only moved up slightly over a matter of weeks so I got out with a small profit.  I'd be interested to know if anything with their military contract materialized.  Maybe it's still in the works."
03/15/2021,stocks,Holding long term not worried about short term gains
03/15/2021,stocks,My only regret is not selling my position at the end of January to buy three time as much last week haha. I think they have a lot of potential long term and since I am Canadians it is one of the few companies that I feel confident investing in with my own currency (in the TSE).
03/15/2021,stocks,Everytime I go to sell out of my position for a loss a little voice in my head stops me telling me it will be a 100 dollar stock in a couple of years. I could just be crazy
03/15/2021,stocks,I think BB has exponential potential. I regret not buying more the last couple weeks.
03/15/2021,stocks,"long, in with like 105 shares"

03/15/2021,stocks,i personally love it.  stay the course BB.  i plan to keep it long term.
03/15/2021,stocks,72 at 17.47. Pls fly

03/15/2021,stocks,Too meme and attached to the hip to GME thanks to WSB. BB & AMC holders better pray to sweet baby jesus that GME doesn't tank or else BB & AMC is coming along for the ride.
03/15/2021,stocks,Got 10 more shares today.
03/15/2021,stocks,I think it can hit $13 in 5 years.
03/15/2021,stocks,It’s a long play it will be fine
03/15/2021,stocks,"Its alright. I have stake in it, I want it to grow. But I really dont think its the end all be all investment that everyone is talking about. Like, you can probably find something comparable if not better out there. End of the day, its another highly speculative buy. 

It might be worth getting some exposure to it if you like the DD, but I certainly wont make it a core part of my portfolio. Plus, at this price range of $11-12 I might hesitate in getting a huge stake in the company. I dont think anything largely fundamental has changed about the company since it was trading at $7 a couple of months ago. 

I don't think its even gonna hit even $50 this year, but I would love to be proven wrong lmao"
03/15/2021,stocks,BB is also top stock at the [HACK EFT](https://etfmg.com/funds/hack/)
03/15/2021,stocks,The issue might be in using “play” when buying.   I’m holding long on this one - its a massive bank of patents.  Patience is a practice to develop.  Lecture over.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Bought shares at 15, been averaging down since, now at 1050 shares at 12.34 avg and enjoy seeing this go up and what the future brings for BB."
03/15/2021,stocks,Honestly I think the name blackberry hurts them quite a bit everyone seems to think they still just do phones.
03/15/2021,stocks,I love bb I need to start adding to what I have. Doesn't even matter it's being kept so low to me I wasn't planning to sell for years when I first bought it.
03/15/2021,stocks,I’d love if they rebrand to get rid of their old phone stigma.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Blackberry is a cursed stock. Don’t do it.

They had all kinds of legal and financial struggles when smartphones were becoming an essential business tool, then they stagnated and stopped innovating, leading Apple and Google to come eat their lunch.

They are a tattered shell of their former selves, with nothing but a niche product lineup. An Amazon deal won’t fix that."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I have 600 shares of BB. But now I'm thinking sell and buy PLTR instead.
Wondering what has a better outlook. I've done my DD and I think BB will hit close to $100 in 2-5 years."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I get that they are a great company outside of phones. Yet, if they just developed a single phone to sell on the market, that would be a catalyst to drive the price to the moon.

I have pondered what they are waiting for. I myself am tired of choosing between Android and Apple platforms

Having said that, Im adding more and more shares"
03/15/2021,stocks,"BB is the only stock Ive personally seen have nothing but great news and still drop. I thinks its great longterm, and they have alot going on thats setting them up to provide the security for alot but I have no idea when itll pay off."

03/15/2021,stocks,"first blackberry needs to change its name.
two, it has to make another acquisition - specifically identity. 

blackberry has a mountain to climb to be a cybersecurity player, if you review any of the Gartner papers blackberry is lagging (or not even mentioned) in any of cybersecurity solutions."
03/15/2021,stocks,Quite often BB took a dip after good news. Was getting funny sometimes. BB was also bit predictable according to the Max Pain theory too often. But it will be profitable !
03/15/2021,stocks,"I mean it’s up what, 160% since Nov. Wall Street likes it, it’s just retail boosted it well ahead of where it probably should have been in January. The fact that it’s slowly moving up and is up huge YoY is forgetting because a lot of people bought and are bagholding at $15-20"
03/15/2021,stocks,"It's cause how they handled the iPhone left a shitty taste in people's mouths. They're now a business IT service company more than phone maker and will require time to rebuild the reputation and brand.

IBM had something similar happen with the PC and even though they develop some awesome tech now the stock doesn't move much."
03/15/2021,stocks,It does do something to the price. Good news=plummets 😂
03/15/2021,stocks,"Curious why people think this is a fantastic long term play when you look at the chart and it has been flat and declining for years prior to COVID. This thesis only became popular once someone said something about EV something-something security. Makes little sense, honestly. If anything, this is a highly speculative stock, and can only tentatively say it is a long term investment. It’s entirely conjecture at this point."
03/15/2021,stocks,Good call. I had to force myself to leave stocks like BB sit in my portfolio undisturbed. I get the urge to dump it sometimes but what's the point of breaking even? Or losing??
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you plan on holding for a long time, you should average down if the price is holding steady like BB did once it tanked from the meme jump. Example: If you bought in 100 shares at $25, then bought another 100 at $8, suddenly you've got 200 shares with an average cost of $16.5. If you buy 200 shares at $8, now it's $13.58 average cost. It will take forever to so much as break even at a $25 average cost, but averaging down means you can exit sooner, or just make more as it goes up.

This helps you in long-term game because now you're only -$5.58 a share rather than -$17. It also means if you're going to sell call options your basis is significantly lower for a less risky strike price or a strike price that generates larger premiums (you'd only be getting $18 premium for a $25 1APR2021 call versus $54 for a $15.50 1APR2021 call).

&#x200B;

You don't always have to give up because of a FOMO at a high price."
03/15/2021,stocks,Not holding out for much as far as earnings. I think guidance is more important here.
03/15/2021,stocks,A lot of interest on what BB was paid by FB in the patent suit.
03/15/2021,stocks,They need to show some profits or at least a good outlook with some of these deals they've made recently.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah every company with n number of employees has to do \*something\* so BB is doing that. It's not a growth stock imo and will never achieve the massive success everyone is hyping about.

Remember how Java is in like billions of devices (from their download ads) but Oracle has only grown 50% in the last 5 years? 

Both are old software co's."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Best opinion in response to this thread. This is a meme stock. Doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad, but it’s just highly speculative and is certainly not a “great long term play”. Honestly no one knows. If you want to invest fine, but don’t be surprised if you’re a bag holder for a lifetime."
03/15/2021,stocks,It amazes me that this gets downvoted. This sub is truly an echo chamber
03/15/2021,stocks,"What made you invest in 2013 though? The only reason I can think of is doing it based on the CEO. To which Chen took around 10 years to turn around Sybase.

03/15/2021,stocks,it was $7 a few months ago; that huge spike in price to the 20s happened during the first GME spike when all the BANG stocks shot up. Im guessing OP is referring to that time frame

03/15/2021,stocks,"The problem with that is the opportunity cost.  


You could potentially put that money elsewhere which may make better returns, rather than just throwing more money down the BB hole."
03/15/2021,stocks,"You realize all of this is psychological, right? You didn't gain anything by doing an ""average down""; your original stock still cost $25, while your later stock cost $8. If the stock grows to $16.5 and you exited, it might *feel* like you've gotten away loss free, but in actuality all you did was pair your original loss ($25 - 16.5) with your new gain ($16.5 - $8). If you had just bought at $8, instead, and not taken the original loss, you'd be up $850 dollars.

In other words, *you lost $850 dollars either way*. It's just that you gained $850 by buying in at $8 so it seems like you lost nothing, when in fact you did but made a profit of $850 on your $8 purchase on another trade to ""even"" out your loss.

Options are a bit more complicated but if you get assigned, it's the exact same situation as trading - all you did was pair a loss with a different gain. 

The only reason to ""average down"" is if you believe the stock is actually under valued at $8.

But then you could do that whether you invested $25 in it or not. Again, if you never took that initial loss, all the gains past $8 would be pure profit. Don't double down on your losses just because you don't like to lose."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Dude, same. Buying BB at $17 was a lesson about FOMO investing that I'll never forget. On the bright side, I used about $1000 in ""free money"" that I had accrued from credit card reward points. Hopefully this investment will pay off in the long run. DD makes me think so 😌"

03/15/2021,stocks,"Actually, it's not psychological at all, as detailed in all the points I made in my post. The point of my post was specifically detailed as an option for people that lost money but may see the value in keeping an asset rather than selling it because it has a legitimate long-term outlook, not because it makes you feel better about having a lower average.

If you want to sit and separate your basis of the same stock purchased at different prices and treat them as independents, that's another viewpoint you can use that's completely valid. There are advantages to that, because if you do buy the additional 200 shares and sell say two $12 strike calls with your $8 basis, you'll be getting about $125 each from those compared to $54 each if you averaged the cost of shares and sold $15.50 calls.

I agree that you shouldn't just slap another purchase in because it makes the number look better to you, though. As I replied to the other person, you need to weigh in what you want to do with the stock and what your outlook is. Don't bag carry because it sucks, but also don't just sit on a massive loss when you have a positive outlook on a stock. And don't get in a wash-sale tax conundrum, either."

2021-03-15 19:54:39,stocks,"Questions about buying and selling shares Alright. Let me start off by saying I'm still very new to this whole investing thing. But I understand that there is risk in losing money (luckily so far I've made about a 40% return on my portfolio)

Second. I understand no one here is probably a legal advisor. And anything that is told here is not ""legal advise from an accountant and blah blah blah"" whatever the words that need to be used are.

And third. I understand the concept of buy low, sell high.

But what my question is, is should I be selling high and buying low within the same stock? Or should I be selling high in one stock, and putting those gains into a different stock thats at a good buying dip? Or does it not really matter?

TL:DR, do I keep my buy low/sell high money within the same stock? Or move it around different stocks as they fluctuate?

Thank you for your explanations in advance"

You could sit in cash and wait till your original stock falls and trade it back and forth. Some people like to stick with just a handful of companies they study and know intimately but most people have a strategy and rotate between different stocks and sectors and avoid sitting in cash.. unless they anticipate a major correction and are waiting for an opportunity to grab things cheap.

It all depends on your overall strategy and your immediate strategy."

I would advise you to learn about the market as much as you can and come up with an attainable goal that you want to achieve and then form a realistic plan on how you can achieve said goal. Once you've done that set a new goal and repeat."

I wouldn't say my goal currently is retirement considering I only started my portfolio with $150, just to see what I can learn. But I like the advise of setting goals.

Not all the ones I buy and hold have enough volatility to swing trade, so some will overlap in both strategies."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Set a goal and try to detach yourself from the euphoria that's going around right now. It won't last, the market will be brutally painful again sooner or later that's why you need goals and a plan.

2021-03-15 19:47:37,stocks,"Does Verizon with its 4.5% dividend have any growth potential? Hi. I have been pondering on adding VZ to my dividend portfolio. I like it from the dividend perspective but I don’t want to buy a dying company. 

AT&T has bigger dividend of 7% but I don’t see any future in it. 

I am hoping that VZ could be a 5G play with some growth left in it in addition to its healthy dividend. 

Any opinions/feedback?  Any other company I should be looking at instead for a potential upside along with income? 

Thank you!"
03/15/2021,stocks,I just picked up VZ too. Warren buffett sees something in VZ.  Maybe because they are sitting on a lot of cash at the moment I'm not too sure. Lots of investment into 5G.

03/15/2021,stocks,"I bought a bunch of VZ last week (right before it went down of course) but bought it assuming no growth and it would act like a 4.5% bond with some inflation protection. It held up super well last March. I think the growth potential isn’t huge, I’m more worried about them being disrupted by low orbit satellites (eg Amazon) though that is years off. I don’t think it is a dying company by any means.

I bought a ton of an Invesco high dividend/low volatility ETF which I actually think has similar characteristics to VZ but more growth potential (and more risk). Primarily utilities, telecom, and tobacco. Boring as hell but taking a really defensive position as we head into choppy waters.

03/15/2021,stocks,"can't really talk about the stock much, but as far as phone companies go, I see Verizon as king for the future. They're more expensive than others but, have more land coverage.... if I had any other carrier where I live, I wouldn't have reception. AT&T might make more in cities because lower price, but as da 'rona pushed more people to remotely working from home, and many industries found that more cost effective than keeping a property in the city for people to work at and will likely continue it, people will likely want better cell service at their home a hour or two out from the city and that remote infrastructure is owned by Verizon (there are a few cheaper knock-off carriers than Verizon options that run off their infrastructure, but running off those is still going to give Verizon money)"

...
The death cross name derives from the X-shape created when the short-term moving average descends below the long-term moving average. Historically, the pattern precedes a prolonged downturn for both the long-term and short-term moving averages. The death cross is a signal that short-term momentum in a stock or stock index is slowing, but it is not always a reliable indicator that a bull market is about to end. There have been many times when a death cross appeared, such as in the summer of 2016, when it proved to be a false indicator.""

03/15/2021,stocks,"It doesn't matter because if GOE’s payout ratio is 1500% you can basically disregard the dividend. 

Of course, geo’s payout ratio is actually 189% (I'm sure you know this, right?)

Let me say it another way, as CEO of a failing business I can take out a $50M loan, distribute it in dividends, skyrocketing the div yield, and the market would take it negatively due to debt service payments hurting future operations. 

Simply looking at div yield is like saying my business had a good quarter because k1 distro was high. Dividends aren't static and the yield is determined historically, not predictively. 

GEO has cut their dividend in half in the last two quarters. Predicting whether or not they cut it again next quart is more important than monitoring what they did last quarter. But most importantly, would be predicting their net income next quarter. Whether or not they pay it out, buyback stock or stockpile it is short of inconsequential. It's like taking money out of the ATM and thinking you've increased your income"

I can never find the right moment to sell. Even when selling a valuable ticket, I find myself not maximizing my gains by selling too late or too soon and consequently undoing my profits. 

This update is to clarify my question. 

I only have a couple of thousand dollars. This far have been lucky enough to cash out on positions after double digits percentage gained. However, I have been noticing that I am missing on the short term growth. Allow me to share a recent example please. 

I enter AGTC  at $4.81 and sold @ $6.96. This was great! But notice that AGTC continued up to $9.00, and later come back down to $4.80 again. I enter the position at $5.00 again, but I have no idea how to understand when to exit at a better time. What signals do you use on Think or Swim?"

Put differently, I would only sell because of the business, not the market"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Just depends. If you’re in short term positions, it’s difficult for anyone here to say when you should sell. This is precisely why it’s difficult to outperform the market over long periods of time. If you hold quality positions and your portfolio is well diversified, there’s a decent chance that you should never really sell as market timing efforts go the wrong way most of the time. 

The great thing about buy and hold is you don’t have to worry about volatility. You take positions knowing the markets will decline and that your account will recover as you’re holding quality."

If you’re an investor seeking advice. SELL BEFORE EARNINGS! 

You do NOT have to worry about a stock rally in GME after earnings. If there is a rally, it might be from $9-$14 because Ryan provides a strategy for making GameStop digital which makes no sense since Microsoft and Sony have point to action to the consumer direct, so GameSmart as I see it, is a BANKRUPT company with a B- credit rating.

Please heed advice and if you especially made money, SELL. You will never regret that, because the upside is nominal on some @Redditors trying to manipulate a stock. Don’t invest based on that, please.

Invest on fundamentals, which if you look at objectively, is a BANKRUPT business similar to BlockBuster, it also had a “Dead Cat Bounce”, and then Crash. Bam. Thank you Mam!

I have not figure out anything yet. On the Internet, trying to learn thinkorswim, I stumbled on a website that has some study code that I put on the study.

Also, another uses posted on this site the following, which I have beenusing as a compass.

""my bread and butter strategy is to look for a stocks that has 1m average daily volume that has a large daily true range. Then I like to look to see if they have any premarket movement and if so why? Once I do all that I plot support and resistance lines. I use indicators to enter and exit. I use a 9 exponential moving average and a 30 weighted. Also a 50 simple to look at trend. Basically to go long I need the stock to be over the 50 and then I wait for the 9 to cross the 30 for entry. My exit is usually my daily trade reward % or once stock trades below the 9.""

A lot of lunch and thee two strategies combined have helped me navegate the market void for the past month or so.

2021-03-15 19:07:41,stocks,"seeking Alpha article about ICLN overall points made in the article about the possible crash:

&#x200B;

* Clean energy stocks are currently in a sharp correction as many new bearish catalysts appear.
* There has been a sharp reversal in the surge of Google search volumes for ""green energy stocks"" and ""ICLN"".
* Many firms in the clean energy ETF ICLN are overvalued with overseas manufactures being the few remaining value opportunities.
* While green energy is the future, this growth appears to be more than priced into most of the top stocks in ICLN.
* As margin debt, taxes, and cash levels lower market liquidity, we may see a prolonged crash in ICLN and its top holdings.

thoughts on this?  I am really heavy in ICLN so just wanted to get others thoughts."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Clean energy is just so dependent upon what can actually get passed in the senate. It’s always difficult to know what’s realistic to pass and what is just “fluff” for an election cycle. If infrastructure and clean energy are tied together in a bill that can pass soon then there’s brighter days. If they can’t pass a bill amd dem’s need to pass clean energy and infrastructure through the budget method like they just did with the stimulus, it may be a bumpy ride. Given the major drawdown from highs, at least risk/reward is a bit more reflective of that now."
03/15/2021,stocks,"> Clean energy stocks are currently in a sharp correction as many new bearish catalysts appear.


I'm failing to see what he means by this. Clean energy went down with tech during the feb correction, but has been going sharply up with the rest of the tech stocks last week.



> There has been a sharp reversal in the surge of Google search volumes for ""green energy stocks"" and ""ICLN"".


There is less hype around clean energy because not many political news around it recently. I'd expect a new surge once Biden actually release clear plans for it. I heard it will be included in the infrastructure bill.


> Many firms in the clean energy ETF ICLN are overvalued with overseas manufactures being the few remaining value opportunities.


ICLN is definitely not a value play. Its a growth play, which is why it tanks with tech when there are inflation fears, but goes back up with tech.



But overall, i am tempted to say for me ICLN is a ""hold"". I wouldn't advise a new investor to get into it, but i'm not sure its a hard sell. I can see it going back up with tech once this tech selloff ends.



I can be totally wrong tho."
03/15/2021,stocks,"ICLN was a way to bet on the sector as a whole. The elections were great because the whole sector was getting lifted with Democratic wins, but now companies have to produce. Not every company in ICLN is a winner without serious tax breaks so unless there is a major reversal I would recommend ICLN holders start choosing their favorites.

1. Too hype, valuation and other factors are moved in too fast too high. This is like a dot com bubble. 
2. Chinese exposer, idk if anyone actually checked out chinese solar companies on ICLN holding. After few chinese scamming companies, i lost interest on the chinese related stocks. I might be wrong, but i think risk is higher than the bright sunny days. Plus, i haven’t found any chinese stock that pays dividends, are they clean and true about their cash flow at all?

03/15/2021,stocks,The infrastructure Is going to be big. Dems hold control and if the GOP don’t want negotiate I think it goes through budget reconciliation like we saw with the stimulus.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yea, but I’m pretty sure it needs 60 votes in the senate to pass. An infrastructure/clean energy bill likely won’t pass through traditional means. Especially since stimulus was just passed with 0 republican votes. 

With the budget reconciliation it can’t be done with simple majority, but not sure if they can do that this year or not. 

I’d assume the only chance is through reconciliation but there’s limitations to that, especially how often it can be used. Pretty sure it’s only once a year and it was just used for stimulus. I’m just not an expert in this area so maybe there’s a way they can do it twice in a year"
03/15/2021,stocks,"There are a couple of environmentally friendly REITs and energy companies like DLR, HASI, NEE. They also have a risk of overvaluation, but REITs tend to be more value-focused than things like PLUG which is ICLN's biggest holding."
03/15/2021,stocks,"If they require republican support then its 100% dead. They will purposely block pretty much anything. Even the ""moderates"" like Romney will most likely block anything green, getting 10 of them to vote for it is impossible."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yea for sure. So it all hinges on budget reconciliation, which I think they can do. If Biden’s able to announce that they will do it through that route, there could be a pop in clean energy. There’s just so much risk in that as courts could rule against adding certain things to the budget like they did with the minimum wage hike. I assume that the dems could care less about working with republicans after dealing with the trump regime. It seems everything will be in deadlock unless it’s passed through non traditional means."
2021-03-15 19:06:57,stocks,"I have X amount of money and I'm looking to reach a set target in ~two years time, what's the best way? So right now I'm in my second year of university and I'm wanting to travel after my third, so around August 2022 at the earliest.

Right now, I have roughly £1000 saved up, currently in a mix of AAPL, AMZN, ASRT, and SUMO. At the moment I've been setting small price targets and taking a profit, but this is risky and perhaps not advisable for a beginner. So I'm thinking about moving it all into a mix of ETFs 

Ideally I'd want around £3000 to travel for a few months, so let's say I want a 200% profit.

Would it be better to invest the lump sum into something like the S&P500 / NASDAQ100, or perhaps spread it over separate ETFs, and if so what would be a good mix in your opinion?

I have a fairly high risk tolerance (if that isn't obvious from investing in ASRT) but I'm still considering playing it safe instead. 

I have a small emergency budget (~£300, and my parents)."
03/15/2021,stocks,Trying to get 200% returns in a year is more likely going to have you losing money. I'd suggest getting a job to have some money to travel or realign your expectations.
03/15/2021,stocks,Don't we all want 200% profit before summer ?  Reality is probably you cannot ~ but if you don't mind losing that $1k ~ you can try more risky stuff
03/15/2021,stocks,"Lol, how do I print money with no risk?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"The best performing ETF of last year, ARKG, returned over 180%. That is not typical of an ETF, and indeed, this year, its pulled back quite a bit. Keep in mind, 2020 saw a tremendous run up in stocks that, so far this year, doesn't seem to be the same.

So expecting 200% out of an ETF or blend of ETFs in your timeframe is pretty unrealistic. 

I could see Apple going up 50%, so I'd stay put there. Risk is that the semiconductor shortage slows their production. But plenty of folks predicting the stock hits 3T market cap in the next year.

If you could buy American options, I'd look for some cheap ones you can buy. Doubled my money on a BAC and a T call earlier this year. There are a surprising amount of low-volatility value stocks that are offering inexpensive options betting on 5-6% moves, which isn't insane in this market.

I guess the same can be asked on the inverse side in terms of loss. I’m generally referencing calls in the above questions, but this can apply to puts as well.

Then someone hopping in their car and driving them to you, or stashing them at a location in the store until you pick them up. There's no efficiency which means no profit.

Consider the alternatives. Amazon and Walmart already do grocery deliveries. With Amazon expanding into grocery stores, first with Whole Foods and now starting their Amazon Fresh business, there's no way something like Instacart will be able to compete outside of niche markets where people want their items from a specific store but aren't able/willing to shop for themselves.

Thinking about it, I think the only place Instacart could find a niche is with people who are physically incapable of shopping on their own. If it became a service where they not only delivered groceries but put them away for you, now you are providing a service for people who are homebound, lack mobility, etc. Then they could potentially charge a premium and even convince insurance companies to foot part of the bill."

I love Instacart... while working from home all last year and not going anywhere... Instacart became a lifeline and the preferred way I ordered groceries. 

Now that I have my first dose of the vaccine and things have slowly been going back to normal, I still use it but nowhere near as often as last year. I'd guess it's similar for others too.

This one is tough for me. I love the company. I always had perfect experiences except for that one time when Aldi didn't have the cookies I wanted and the shopper decided to take it upon themselves to replace it with Fig Newtons(even though I specified not to replace that item with anything if it was out of stock). 

I guess it really depends on what it's priced at. Even then, I'm not sure. It wouldn't be that difficult for Uber, any of the food delivery services, or just some other random company to implement grocery delivery.

Don't get me wrong, they'll still have a niche of serving the elderly, handicapped, or extremely busy in either food deserts, or condensed cities. But it really only seems to have a future with those extremes. 

Competitors like amazon, and walmart further encroach upon instacart's territory. At their core, the only edge instacart has is fast, fresh, or niche products. And I just don't see a lot of growth for that."
03/15/2021,stocks,InstaCart is Kroger’s delivery partner. When the pandemic hit I used the service out of fear. Since then I’ve kept using it out of convenience. If they go public I’m adding them to the portfolio.

03/15/2021,stocks,Same instacart sucks and they charge me like 14$ for a quarter mile delivery. That's not even including the 5$ tip I give. So .19$ for a grocery store five blocks away lol

Could stimulus negate this meeting just one time or is one or twenty April put options a legitimate ’play’ in the world of tenured folks?"

03/15/2021,stocks,"I think GoPro is still undervalued by a lot today. This is a company that has had to learn a lot about how to run a lean hardware company and not just try to pretend like they are an Apple or a typical silicon valley hardware company. 

Their most recent quarter showed $116M subscription based revenue and I believe overall revenue $350M +. Just based on the sticky subscription revenue and where the market is at with P/S ratio in similar industries, even giving a PS ratio of 5 to their subscription model... $116 x 4 x 5 = $2.32 Billion. This is just revenue from the subscription. At the current market cap of 1.6 B, I think they are incredibly undervalued. 

Assuming the annual hardware revenue of $700M (I believe last years was similar), assuming a PS of 3, that's $2.1 B in market value. 

So a  total market cap of $4.4 B would not be out of place. And I believe the market is just starting to realize that. I think this rally could go for a bit....

Disclosure: I am long GoPro. 

This is not financial advice. Solely my own opinion. Please do your own research and consult with a financial advisor for investing."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm a bear on this company. I'm honestly confused at why people are purchasing shares. I love my GoPro Hero8 though.

\- They haven't innovated. They fell behind on drone development, and then fell completely on their face once they attempted to produce one.

\- Appeared to be a new hot toy back when the GoPro 1-4 was being released. Consumers thought it could be a better camera phone replacement, or a replacement for a camcorder or camera. It is none of these.

\- Too much of a niche market. Not enough innovation for consumers to upgrade year over year. I don't think vloggers and active/adventure crowd is enough to keep this as a 'growing' company.

\- Growing competition. DJI seems to be cannibalizing some of those customers, as well as other and cheaper brands.

&#x200B;

Bull case:

\- Good revenues, so far.

\- Strong accessory sales.

\- Good subscription cloud service with a good interface. But it is clunky and not user friendly to get photos/videos automatically loaded to your account."

I saw news about their conference a couple weeks ago, then nada. I seriously saw an article insinuate this little run is due to reddit interest, which I do not agree with whatsoever"
03/15/2021,stocks,"The issue i have with Gopro is that they don't really have breakthrough products anymore. Does the hero 9 really offer that much more than the hero 8?  Unless you're a real video technophile,  most users record videos to slap it on youtube.  From a user's perspective, it's not really worth it to continually upgrade cameras.  Add to that clones that are 1/2 the price and getting better every day, the competition is getting stiffer.

Some times I feel like the powers to be make good decisions only after having exhausted the bad ones. I'm not talking about the Karma fiasco, but little things like not having a removable lens protector on the Hero 8. At least they re-introduced it  on the newest version after so many people bitching about it (and rightly so) . Or like finally having the USB trigger power. That should have been a feature 3 or 4 generations ago (just like on some of the clones). Little things like that add up.

I think Gopro overall is a decent company, and obviously the 800lb gorilla in the action camera room. But where are they going? What will the hero 10 feature? 8k if they can find an effective way to deal with overheating issues? When will 8k monitors/tv be mainstream enough ? 4k is currently about 40% of the market.  When the optimal performance of a product is  tied to another consumer product over which you have no control, there is a point where you can only push so far out. After that, you have to wait till the market catches up.

Edit; smooth brain ape, i know nothing . I see nothing."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Some great points. I don't see them as what does the next product bring (like iPhone for instance) company. I see them as how can they pivot to more of a software/ app/ services company that has a niche product that they will be best in market for? For such a company, a market cap of $25 B (I completely made up this number), which in the grand scheme of things is pretty small, is still a huge upside as of today. I think there are cameras out there that are 90% as good as GoPro that are at 50% cost. But when you combine the app, the brand name, the newly found subscription model and how small the niche segment is, I don't see anyone taking their lunch away if they execute well for next few years. Everything I have heard on the calls and read in their earnings points to them doing well medium to long term. ( See Garmin, Bose as good examples of such companies that execute well and still exist in a crowded space by going Niche)"

2021-03-15 17:33:22,stocks,"Why the hell is retail up so high? XRT is an ETF that tracks retail. Here is the chart. https://imgur.com/a/a027rvQ 

I can understand a rally leading into loosening of coronavirus restrictions and people going out and about. However, retail has been on a decline for years. You can see this ETF was trading in the 40s in 2016 and now its all the way up to mid 90s? Does anyone have a good explanation for this or are these companies way overvalued? 

The only thing I can think of to justify the valuations is that a ton of these retailers who were slowly losing for the last few years have been pushed to expedite their ecommerce transition during COVID so it is possible that these valuations are secondary to the retail market actually successfully pivoting.

Any thoughts?

My guess is a lot of people predict that with North Americans having a lot of savings from the pandemic after staying at home for so long, they would go on a spending spree once the pandemic is over in travel, restaurants, and retail. I fear that the recovery stocks have now priced this in and it's high risk low reward because they can quickly drop if they don't perform at their expectations. Also think some people are taking advantage of others trying to buy up recovery stocks simply because they are not at their pre pandemic levels and are planning to dump them once it stops growing like with Macy's stock surging in the past week."

2021-03-15 17:31:45,stocks,"Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose # Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at this chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly 1 million new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah the debt is certainly a concern, but it appears to me at least that they are in a good place for the short term.

Like /u/LiftUni said, the ""light truck"" segment [has the highest loyalty rate of any segment](https://www.edmunds.com/about/press/truck-loyalty-climbs-to-an-all-time-high-reports-edmundscom.html).  Couple this with the fact that [the F150 has been the best-selling *vehicle* in the US for the past 40-plus years](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/the-ford-f-150-pickup-truck-is-the-best-selling-vehicle-in-the-us-and-the-newest-version-gets-revealed-tonight/ar-BB15Y5eF) and they're basically like [Jack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDpipB4yehk) getting those leads.  Even if they convert a small percentage of ICE owners, it'll be a huge boost to kick-start the segment.

What remains to be seen, however, is how well that converts to fleet.  See, within new car sales, there's ""retail"" (people like you or me who buy one car at a time) and then, amongst other types of sales, ""fleet"" (rental car companies, local municipalities, etc.).  A sizeable percentage of those ""best selling vehicle"" sales come from fleet sales (not able to find figures, sorry).  Within the fleet category, the [base level trims are far and away the most popular](https://www.automotive-fleet.com/345222/2019-fleet-truck-of-the-year-ford-f-150); obviously, the EV-150 will not fall into ""base trim"".  Conversely, we are hearing whispers from [PZEV states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_zero-emissions_vehicle) that might attempt to force their municipalities to only buy EV fleet vehicles.  If so, Ford will essentially have a lock on that market as GM is focusing on the high-line affluent market with the Hummer, Rivian is still unproven, and Tesla's Cybertruck is a non-starter sans maybe some localities where it is produced."
03/15/2021,stocks,I'm in an industry that requires I purchase a truck and I'm damn interested in this tbh. With the milage I run the math will probably work in favor of EV despite the price hike from the standard 150 package
03/15/2021,stocks,"E150 

Edit: NVM, didn't know this was already a van lol"
03/15/2021,stocks,neighbour has a jeep keeps asking how many kms on my ranger. his routinely has problems and its new.
03/15/2021,stocks,I hate Jeeps with a deep passion. I used to drive them for work and they broke down on me 60-70mi from civilization multiple times. I can't state enough how much they are pieces of absolute garbage.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Don’t worry, EV vans will come eventually and you can upgrade!"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Oh no, you did a great job! Sorry, if my comment came out that way. Just wanted to add another reason for people to consider looking into $F. I am very bullish on $F (lots of shares and leaps.)"
03/15/2021,stocks,The brand loyalty in the truck market is exceptional.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Tesla isn't just making the Cybertruck for regular truck buyers, it's also for people who don't normally buy pick up trucks.

How do you think Tesla outsold nearly every other luxury sedan in the US market combined with the Model 3? It wasn't by getting luxury car owners from other brands to abandon them en mass and switch to Tesla, it was largely by getting people who don't normally buy luxury cars to buy a luxury car. The most traded in car for a Model 3 was the Toyota Prius."
03/15/2021,stocks,except the 900k+ ppl who pre ordered the cyber truck. only people who would even think of getting an ICE transitioning to EV are people who want to pay more for less range
03/15/2021,stocks,"In Iacocca's day (at Chrysler) they spent a $billion to build their design center... 1980?   It's an expensive industry.  Invest at the bleeding edge, or look dated. 

I just wish they'd focus on drivers instead of internet devices for drivers."
03/15/2021,stocks,Why not sell puts into an entry?
03/15/2021,stocks,"I am very happy to gain money by exploiting working class and leave them dead by the side of the road, if that's what you were wondering about."
03/15/2021,stocks,👍  true
03/15/2021,stocks,Thank you for this.
03/15/2021,stocks,I simply cannot invest into American auto manufacturers for this reason; I don't believe in their product. Warren Buffet style. I firmly believe they make overpriced trucks that will hopefully last you 12 years. Far cry from the iron turtles they used to make that you still see driving around.
03/15/2021,stocks,"> Hatch backs aren't cool? I never realized, I was wondering why no-one makes station wagons anymore. I miss them.

I miss my old station wagon too. My first car was a 1993 Ford Taurus station wagon, and I had room to fit six people in it easily, plus backing up was a breeze and I still got decent gas mileage."
03/15/2021,stocks,"At this point in the evolution of the segments and body styles, CUVs and XUVs are rebranded ""hatchbacks""."
03/15/2021,stocks,Thank you for your sacrifice.
03/15/2021,stocks,No one ever went broke selling for profit.
03/15/2021,stocks,You forgot to add “we rate it a buy” to be a CNBC analyst.
03/15/2021,stocks,This is the most attractive part of a Ford play right now. The Hybrid and EV F150 are slated to take fleet vehicles by storm. I know for a fact the company I work for has 500 pick up trucks(GM) they will all be converting to Ford. Companies are sick of paying for gas. We can charge them on site.
03/15/2021,stocks,Then why are you looking to exit soon?
03/15/2021,stocks,I live and work in the NWT and drive to BC under what EVs have right now it would never suit my needs. maybe one day but it’s almost like going back in time. there use be lots of little gas stations due to poor mileage. now we need charging stations in the middle of nowhere haha ironic.
03/15/2021,stocks,Haha - missed opportunity for Ford eh
03/15/2021,stocks,Don't forget the death wobble!
03/15/2021,stocks,"NOW I'M LIVIN' IN AN EEEEEE-VAN, DOWN BY THE RIVER.

I CAN SELL MY EXTRA JUICE FOR POWER!  WHICH GIVES LIL' JIMMY SOME MORE TIME ON THE OL' VENTILATOR."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm not impressed with 900k non-binding pre-orders. Tesla has a headstart on the EV trend, no denying that. But I highly doubt the future trucks of America are going to look like the cybertruck."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Eh, it’s a $100 refundable pre-order"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yea I had a buddy buy a new F150 this year and when he questioned my lackluster enthusiasm for him, I said “oh it’s a nice truck but it’s only going to last 150k miles or 10 years.”

To which he responded “yea, I sell it right before 100k and move on.”

He seemed to understand his purchase was disposable and wouldn’t hold any value. 

Because he understood this and made the purchase anyway, and because of people like my grandfather own multiple mustangs, I am still bullish Ford. 

But I would never buy one myself, new or used."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah I guess I thought car companies stopped making them to push people into more expensive crossover suvs. But there are so many people that loved theirs, from a lot of different makers. I had a Volvo wagon that was great, a ton of people loved the Subaru foresters when they were wagons, the Honda accord wagons had their fans. 

Aside from being practical I don't feel any cooler riding around in a civic than I did with a station wagon. But I'm not a car guy. I guess I'm not a big demographic in the US in that I want a spacious but small vehicle."
03/15/2021,stocks,A station wagon is nothing but an SUV at half the price and half the ground clearance.
03/15/2021,stocks,"That's a very good point!  Most city fleet trucks will be doing driving in low-MPG situations in short distances around the city and then heading back to the garage for 12+ hours of charging.  I think Ford's experience with fleet and getting to know what their customers want and need really set themselves up nicely for the battle of the EV light truck segment; this is one area that newcomers like Tesla and Rivian come up short in.

Plus, if you know anyone that works white collar stuff and parks in a garage downtown for a job, you'll see plenty of pickups that are mainly used as commuter vehicles and used to tow toys (boats, bikes, go ""up north"") a handful of times a year.  Rivian might appeal to these buyers a little bit more (think WA/OR/CO/MI Subaru owners) but the EV-150 is a damn strong competitor too.

My exit position goal was 3x but depending on how the next two years shape up, might hold and hope for 4x, especially if they reintroduce a dividend."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Which is fine.  Battery tech isn't able to completely supplant petrol at the moment.

But for every instance of you working in below-freezing weather almost half the year and driving hundreds of miles, there are two or three guys working in municipalities like Los Angeles, Houston, Atlanta, or Miami that stay close to the garage and have the units back to charge for 12+ hours every night."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yea that's a huge drawback. And it's not even 1:1 because stopping at a charging station is I think the fastest at like 45 minutes and not even a full charge. EV as it stands is almost strictly a commuter car, which to be fair covers most drivers needs.

That said, I'll wait for details when EV trucks hit mainstream, if only because they could probably house much larger batteries."
03/15/2021,stocks,I imagine you could charge while at work
03/15/2021,stocks,Suv killed station wagons.
03/15/2021,stocks,"And a ""crossover"" is just a modern station wagon.  The magic of marketing."
03/15/2021,stocks,My exit position is when my investment = F150 fully loaded.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah -50C in winter and my shortest drive to the nearest place is 100km there and back. 

Nothing to put on 1000km on a long drive in the summer."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Lol. Crossover, We make it LOOK like an SUV but we just use car parts. Then, here is the good part, We get rid of the sliding door and make a longer hood so people won’t know it’s really a minivan!"
03/15/2021,stocks,"lol, I like the way you think!  I'll see you at the lake, my friend."
2021-03-15 17:28:56,stocks,"Semiconductor Stocks Sleeping Giant With crypto, meme stocks, and reopening stocks highlighted right now, semiconductor stocks are quietly gaining traction. Reminder that domestic semiconductor firms have reached out to the government for aid due to the global shortage of chips. The US govt is currently reviewing and we should see in the next month or two how they'll help. Here's some semiconductors I'm eyeing. I'm just keeping it domestic since I doubt federal aid will go to stocks like TSM.

&#x200B;

MU (Micron Technology)

\- They went out of their way mid quarter and RAISED their guidance for the next quarter. Demand for semiconductors are exploding so they upped their targets across the board.

\- Several price targets raises ( Daiwa Securities 140$, Citi 100$, Cowen 90$)

&#x200B;

INTC (Intel Corporation)

\- Senator Buying.  Senator Carper bought stocks. I like to follow trades like this. Keep in mind a senator bought PENN weeks before the S&P500 announcement

\-  World's leading maker of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers 

&#x200B;

ON (On Semiconductor) 

\- One of the few cheaper semiconductors that hasn't ran too hard yet. Around 38$ right now. 

\- Several price targets at 45+

\- Beat earnings and gave good guidance.

&#x200B;

Other semiconductor stocks could include AMD, NVDA. I personally don't like AMD. It's always burned me and I feel like there's heavy manipulation on that stock to keep it under 100. NVDA is already high priced so itll be hard to run up more but very possible if the treasury yields isn't wack again."
03/15/2021,stocks,There is only one semiconductor sleeping giant and TSM does not share power!
03/15/2021,stocks,"TSM is better, under $120 is a buy."
03/15/2021,stocks,"When I heard that Biden had announced a 100 Day Study on the chip shortage crisis I also knew it would be a great chance for a semi play.

I went with INTC shares and 2022 Leap Options. Might be counter intuitive since the shortages aren’t in INTC’s core area, but I can see Biden working with INTC to develop some US-based chip manufacturing sites."
03/15/2021,stocks,SNPS who sells chip design tools. They are no. 1 in this field. Dropped big time recently. Good time to chip in
03/15/2021,stocks,"Intel, tsm, Texas Instruments."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I believe intel is also expanding into the GPU space, if properly executed that could be huge for them."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Mu isn't properly sleeping, actually at ATH, Intel managed to lose their advantage towards AMD because they got sloppy.  
On seems interesting.  
Amd got back to top either with CPUs and GPUs.  
Where's **ARM**?"
03/15/2021,stocks,Look at IQE on LSE
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think you've got to remember that it's likely all of the semi-conductor companies will do quite well from this. Mainly because one company alone will not be able to meet demand in the timescale required. So AMD, NVDA could and will probably succeed alongside the ones you've mentioned.

Another sleeper you might want to look into is BESI which is European and so you can catch the exposure there from the semiconductor demand."
03/15/2021,stocks,Just looked up PENN read nothing about Semiconductors
03/15/2021,stocks,"> chip in

ha"
03/15/2021,stocks,The fact that people hardly mention TXN in these discussions baffles me. They're a solid key player in the market.
03/15/2021,stocks,"TI is not as sexy as some of these other guys. People don't like them because they don't do any cutting edge stuff, but that lowers R&D costs. I've been  buying them for years. Also they have decent dividends."

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-15-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to rise after record closes for Dow and S&P 500

> * U.S. stock futures pushed higher Monday even as the 10-year Treasury yield held around 1.63%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed at record highs Friday. The Nasdaq fell modestly as recently slumping tech stocks continued to fight rising bond yields. However, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all posted strong weekly gains. Ahead of Monday’s open, the Nasdaq was up more than 3.3% for the year. The Dow and S&P 500 were up 7% and almost 5%, respectively in 2021.

*****

> # 2. B/itcoin takes breather after surge to over $60,000

> * B/itcoin dropped 6% on Monday, after jumping Saturday to another all-time high — this time above $60,000. The world’s biggest c/ryptocurrency has just about doubled this year. It’s soared more than 1,000% over the past 12 months. B/itcoin’s market value climbed back above $1 trillion last week. The incredible rally has been driven by increased adoption by larger institutional investors and firms as well as speculative demand.

*****

> # 3. Treasury yields near 1-year highs ahead of Fed meeting

> * While the 10-year Treasury yield was actually a bit lower Monday morning, it was only slightly below its more than one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. The rapid rise in yields this year has traders wondering whether the Federal Reserve may be losing control of the direction of interest rates. The Fed’s two-day March meeting begins Tuesday, with questions about how long near-zero rates and extraordinarily easy Covid monetary policy can last.

*****

> # 4. Biden and Harris to sell $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan

> * The Fed is expected to forecast better economic growth after last week’s signing by President Joe Biden of the $1.9 trillion package of fiscal measures designed to help Americans, U.S. businesses and state and local governments dealing with the fallout from the pandemic. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hit the road this week to sell the Covid stimulus plan, which includes up to $1,400 in direct payments to many people.

> * General Electric is nearing a $30 billion-plus deal to combine its aircraft leasing business with Ireland’s AerCap Holdings, according to The Wall Street Journal. GE Capital Aviation Services is one of the world’s biggest jet leasing companies and leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing and Airbus. Shares of GE rose about 2.5% in Monday’s premarket.

*****

> # 5. Fauci warns against lifting U.S. restrictions right now

> * White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning state leaders that the nation’s battle with the coronavirus is still “not in the end zone.” He urged Americans to adhere to public health measures despite the ramp-up of vaccinations, pointing to new infection spikes in Europe as a cautionary tale of relaxing too soon. As of Sunday night, the CDC reported that nearly 37.5 million people in the U.S. were fully vaccinated — more than 11% of the nation’s population of over 330 million.

Officials said they took the action “out of an abundance of caution,” although AstraZeneca said its review of more than 17 million people showed no increased risk of blood clots.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Normally, how does offering convertible notes effect the stock price? I saw MGNI and DKNG both offered some today and they are both down a bit in pre market. I saw earlier this month Twitter offered $1billion+ and their stock rose that day. Does offering these notes scare investors a bit when it comes from a growth stock like MGNI or DKNG?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Hey guys! Ticker :AONE is going to merge with the leading 3D printing technology company, and has been purchased in bulk by many investors over the last few months, lots of potential for growth, definitely a high conviction investment for me!"
03/15/2021,stocks,Thanks!
03/15/2021,stocks,NOK is not a meme. Theyre a long standing company with a reputation as solid as their phones from the mid 2000s and I am very bullish. I am curious what bears would say since i havent seen many lately.
03/15/2021,stocks,How do you guys feel about ENZC? I hope their patent news last week is a legitimate announcement. It will be life changing for millions.
03/15/2021,stocks,"If the debt instrument is converted to shares in the future, that would dilute the value of the shares held by the current investors, and that is why the investors may not have liked the news. The issuance of debt may also signal an expansion in the business so that might also explain why it may be viewed favourably."

I'm new to investing and would like to use a program like thinkorswim that allows you to go through the graphs for each stock. I'm located in Europe so unfortunately it won't let me create a tdameritrade account to use thinkorswim.

Does anyone know of alternatives? thanks"

It’s been a while since I created my account at tdameritrade so I don’t remember if it asks for an address. If it doesn’t then maybe you can trick them by using a VPN and use a server here in America.

I use a VPN to have access to different things on Netflix that otherwise I wouldn’t."

2021-03-15 16:32:03,stocks,"Is The Stock Market Going To Crash Again In 2021? Should You Buy Stocks Today? Stock Market v Yields & Jobs | Zoom & Nio Opinion Hey there folks! Today I want to talk to you about what’s really going on in the stock market and what we should expected next…

**\[Don't: Read Very Long Post | Dislike Before Reading\]**

So, in the last couple of weeks, we have seen a very fast correction in the tech heavy Nasdaq [Index](https://imgur.com/aK26hjA) after the bond yields rapidly spiked over 1.5% for the 10y, as a lot of investors kept getting spooked by the employment numbers coming in slightly better than expected, though many important things are still hidden in those numbers.

For example, last week we saw the US gaining almost 400K jobs, but this barely moved the unemployment [rate](https://imgur.com/7PJTWUA) which still stands at 6.2% (and this doesn’t even include people who just quit searching for jobs). Almost all of the job [gains](https://imgur.com/B3av5gb) were seen in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has started to regain some momentum after it was the most affected by the events of last year, as this sector is still down more than 3.5M jobs since a year ago.

These past weeks we also [saw](https://imgur.com/yeudkin) jobless claims continuing to go down, with the latest initial jobless claims coming in at the lowest level since last early last year at just over 700K, as the continuing jobless claims also coming in at just over 4.1M.

But guys, regardless of the jobs & unemployment numbers, the main thing that will keep investors on edge will continue to be treasury [yields](https://imgur.com/rDjy9fO), the interest rates and how this are affected by the inflation [numbers](https://imgur.com/awXUGgw) which are expected to see a huge bump in the next months as we will have very low comps compared to last year when we saw the rona starting to pick up steam.

We can see [here](https://imgur.com/QbuiSot) the core inflation came lower this month with an increase of just .1% which jolted the stock market and started a recovery after the sell-off in the past weeks.

Given that tech names & EVs were some of the biggest hit stocks we should also take a quick look at NIO, as the company lost almost half of its value in the past month, dropping from over $66 to just $35 after the big sell off in the past weeks.

NIO’s drop was also amplified probably by the fact that they posted mixed [results](https://imgur.com/t0jRJEW) for the 4th quarter of last year, as they just missed the top line but did manage to post a solid beat on the company’s bottom line, losing just $0.14/share.

Investors might not have been happy to see a guidance of just 15% above their 4th quarter given the huge valuation and expectations of the company and the huge global chip shortage that will limit NIO’s production capacity to just 7.5K/month in the 2nd quarter of 2021.

I still have a mixed opinion about NIO’s stock, but after this huge sell-off, it has become more attractive given the continued [growth](https://imgur.com/cI1TNWJ) of sales the company has seen in the last years, while I also believe NIO will remain one of the winners of the EV disruption.

The other stock that I wanted to mention after what has happened in the past weeks is Zoom.

I really like Zoom’s products and I understand the hype of the stock, but I also really believe they will struggle to keep the huge growth rate going, as the company might have seen its peak growth after the massive work-from-home movement in 2020.

[Zoom](https://imgur.com/UygZxJZ) also reported a beat on the top & bottom line and I expect them to continue to have another great first half to start 2021, but after that, the company will have very though comps to go against, which might really put some downward pressure on the stock, especially as more people go back to their workplaces.

You can see, even the company doesn’t expect the huge growth to continue, with the revenue growth expected to only slightly continue to grow during 2021.

Zoom is valued at almost $100B which is really hard to justify unless the company continues to innovate and bring more & more products to the market, as the industry they operate in will only become more competitive over time with other big players like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce & many others looking to take market share.

Guys, if you are still in doubt about what to do next in the stock market, you should just take a look at the chart below and start thinking long term, because investing, if you are really looking to make money is all about the long-term.

You can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/ZlO593t) in the past 100 years we've had 8 bear markets previous to the one we saw in 2020, with the average bear market lasting just 1.4years compared to over 9 years for every bull market with a staggering difference in gains vs losses as well.

We can also see in this [chart](https://imgur.com/wM39iSQ) that it only took 15 days for the Nasdaq to enter a 10% correction this time, but you can see the average 12 month return after a 10% correction is almost 30% which is huge, with the likelihood of the index posting a positive return in the next 12 months standing at over 90%

So, given that we had a bear market last year, I believe it’s highly unlikely that we will see a huge drop in stocks even if yields continue to rise, as the real return of the treasury yields will continue to be close to 0, as I don’t expect them to jump more than 2% for the 10y anytime soon.

Moving on, I recently saw some [comments](https://imgur.com/I3ijkKT) made by David Tepper which I wasn’t really aware of but which made a lot of sense to me, he highlighted that the other downward pressure put on treasury yields, which will keep them in check, will come from investors in other countries like Japan, Germany & many others, as the US treasuries have become way more attractive than others.

One other thing that I think should be mentioned is that the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/undefined) has continued to make new high after new high in the past week, being led by companies like Disney which has just surpassed 100M [subscribers](https://imgur.com/fCTDNGX) on their Disney+ platform while also getting a boost from their other revenue streams starting to come back online, and of course the stock that has led the DOW in the past week, Boeing, as the [company](https://imgur.com/K6SPGY1) had more sales than cancellations for the first time since November 2019 as the 737 MAX crisis is finally starting to fade away for the company, with even more possible [deals](https://imgur.com/4XYgfs9) likely to close in the next period, as airlines start to have a better view of what the future will bring for them.

Friends, you shouldn’t be scared of stock market corrections or dips as we have [seen](https://imgur.com/74dAwZO) a 10% pullback once every 11 months as you can see, with the frequency of bigger crashes decreasing significantly, but as always, because we are highly emotional beings, it’s very hard for us to handle our emotions after a series of red days.

You should remember though, most often than not, the best way to go is just to ride out the dip and even starting deploying more cash into the stock market the more it drops. I think you should develop a strategy of not selling on big red days and deploying an increasingly higher % of your cash into great stocks the more the stock market drops.

I also fully expect some part of the next stimulus check, which was just signed by Biden, to end up in the stock market, which might help push the stock market on the right path despite increasing pressures from rising yields and possible short-term inflation fears.

**So just to end this post guys, is the stock market going to crash? My short answer is NO!**

I don’t expect that to happen any time soon. Even if we continue to see volatility in the stock market you should use that to your advantage and smartly deploy cash into great companies, which leads me to my other question, should you buy stocks today? Well, at the moment of writing this post, futures are currently trending down pre-market (SP & Nasdaq in the Red, Dow +0.2%) and If they continue to do so it might be a good chance to deploy some cash, but don’t rush into the first red day you see, slowly build your positions or add to them. As a rule of thumb, I like to buy more once a 5% dip occurs in the stock market and slowly deploy cash the more it drops.

03/15/2021,stocks,Thoughts on 4 directors and 1 CFO of Zoom selling all shares and down to 0? I know execs selling is common practice but it seems like an awful lot of insider activity with selling a decent chunk of shares. This alone and their pending lawsuit makes me wonder how deep Zoom will eventually fall.
03/15/2021,stocks,Thanks for the post! It was a good read 👍
03/15/2021,stocks,"Here's why I disagree, valuations are extremely high, the Schiller p/e or cape ratio is at 35 and this speeds out earnings over a 10 year period so it's not just high because earnings are low, for example in 2008 when the s&p p/e was at 100 because earnings were low the Schiller p/e was at 15. So if valuations are this elevated we know we are in a bubble,, in my personal opinion we are actually in the second largest bubble of all time, there's a certain blockchain stock that has a p/s of 500 and a operating margin of -250% and is valued at 5b like that us crazier than anything dot com had, we also have the most overvalued bond market in history and real estate market intersecting with this crazy stock market where valuations are the second highest they have been in history, it's all about the low rates but to end my bear porn response I will say I can't possibly predict when it will pop, I just can't so just buy good companies and hedge up."

03/15/2021,stocks,"The stimulus will add to savings as the last 2 did.  Savings in 2019 were about 600B.  They are now 6T.  Savings in this case *is* investment.  You shouldn't be worried about the market tanking and instead be expecting massive growth over then next few years.  Until the fed changes rates or slows the fiscal flows, it's going to be up, more so even than prior years due to the massive influx of new cash.

Inflation is not a concern until full employment is reached.  And that's far off too.  

The yield % increase has far more to do with the SLR than anything else. It was a technical issue rather than some foreboding signal of a crash."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think this is going to be an unpopular comment but look at the investment [cycle](https://images.app.goo.gl/6PNKSr8CPA5k16NC8) and try to decide for yourself in which stage we are. 

I would say Euphoria, which means a maximum risk. Why?
- Everyone starts investing because 'it will always go up' and 'we can all become millionaires'. This was also the case before the Dot-com bubble. 
- Valuations are through the roof. Sure some companies deserve the valuation but most are just ridiculously high. Also something we saw 20 years ago... 
- Reaction to tweets. Referring to Signal for example, the unrelated stock who gained thousands of %'s because someone tweeted about it... Except it wasn't the same company. Everyone with a phone just invests in whatever without being aware of the company at all. 
- The market is on all-time highs (or close to them) while we are still in a pandemic. The market is too far up from reality. 
- Historically speaking the valuation of companies that aren't making profits is on a all time highs/very highs (not sure) 

And when it goes down all the inexperienced investors with knowledge about the name of their stocks (but nothing more) will panic and sell which will cause a big drop

Also, why is the market going up? Obviously because people are buying, but with what money? Look at the balance sheet of the FED and ECB. Look at the spendings of all governments... They printed and spent so much money (Trillions) and convinced a lot of people that they can keep doing this forever. Yep this will make the market go up, till it goes down... You can't print and print money but at this moment not enough people are aware of it. One day people will realise that their dollar or euro is worth a lot less and a collapse could happen. 
This money also helps the companies stay afloat but for the same reason the spending can't continue so eventually people will lose their jobs and companies go bankrupt. Maybe some will be saved by the massive spending but the effect of the pandemic isn't visible yet. 

So I think it's just a matter of time but for now (on very short time) there is just too much money from governments. Once there is a trigger event or the governments/central banks can't convince the market anymore, all goes down... 

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right but I sure as h*ll am not investing my money at these risky valuations. You can agree with it or not but the fact is we can't look into the future! I have been waiting for a month or two now for this exact reason and it's not making me anything (obviously, waiting never does) so decide for yourself based on your risk appetite and view :)

Disclaimer: This is not an advice, nor the absolute truth.  Just my own point of view/thoughts on the matter. Don't make your decision based on this but do your own research."
03/15/2021,stocks,"IMO a market crash is unlikely but a sideway market is a possibility. Valuations are really high, no doubt about it, anyway growth will be there in the next years and earnings will ramp up making P/E lower and valuations more affordable. Inflation has to be a concern after full reopening. Yields will remain unchanged by the Fed unless there are major spikes in inflation or the government pressures Powell to ease them."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Most use of imgur links in a post I've ever seen. Congrats!

Yes, the market will crash and things will change. Try to manage your personal risk and preserve capital. I was impressed with how well I managed September 2020, less so with Oct-November 2020. I did okay reacting to the 2021 tech rotation without making too many mistakes in things I didn't need to be holding any more."
03/15/2021,stocks,"What about Nio using the battery swapping technology Tesla considered and abandoned? 


> In 2014, Tesla demonstrated the ability to quickly and automatically swap battery packs in Model S and Model X vehicles.

> The technology was touted as a faster way to get a fully charged battery pack and an alternative to DC fast charging.

> The automaker ended up building a single battery swap station and offered owners battery swaps for a limited time before shutting down the facility.

..

> A Tesla official said the company believes electric vehicle charging is the best way to power its vehicles, and that battery swapping is riddled with problems and not suitable for widescale use.

https://electrek.co/2021/03/01/tesla-denies-report-back-into-the-battery-swap-takes-jab-nio/amp/

Charging the battery overnight at home seems preferable to having to battery swap at an external location. On the road, battery swapping is faster than recharging, but the battery you receive could be of dubious quality.

I haven’t done a ton of research, but Nio going ahead with a technology Tesla abandoned makes me question Nio’s model a bit"
03/15/2021,stocks,Historically you should always be buying in the market. You can always average down and take advantage of the there and then but statistically speaking it’s about time in the market not timing of the market.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'll play devil's advocate. S&P 500 is up 16.50% from pre-COVID levels--71% from the March bottom. There isn't one company I am buying at current valuations (and if you want to see what the equity bubble looks like: ROKU, FVRR, DKNG, TSLA, NIO).

03/15/2021,stocks,Well said.  I agree and it is nice to see others feel the same. It helps our emotions to see others are thinking the same. Thanks again for taking the time to post.

They're not warning you because they want to help anyone, they want their MONEY and they want you to SELL so it helps them.  It's like someone trying to tell you your house or car is worth only half the price and they'll buy it from you at half price as a favor.  They can f\*\*k right off, to put it nicely.  They don't give 2 shits about you or anyone if you lose money - in fact in some cases they are sometimes the REASON why some stocks fail and they also play a part in contributing to market crashes.

03/15/2021,stocks,"a crash down, perhaps not for the reasons you've outlined. but I am worried about asset prices rising significantly as a result of unprecedented money printing by the Fed and US government. alot of the stimmy checks end up directly in the stock market, since $1400 is dirt compared to cost of living so the only way to scale it would be to dump it into the booming equity markets. this is like a double effect of increasing money supply + inflating asset prices, crashing the value of the dollar. The fed will lower rates more & print more money in a attempt to stimulate the economy, causing hyperinflation (a crash up). thoughts?"
03/15/2021,stocks,I mean look it up. Almost everyone said wall st has nothing to do with the economy. That was when wall st was doing good while mid pandemic normal / poor were struggling to eat and pay rent. NOW watch when it does crash it will directly affect it.....
03/15/2021,stocks,I respect your opinion but I do think we will see a correction this year that will be around 20% or so of ATH. This is based on another person's opinion however its supposed to happen sometime this year. It will obviously be surrounded by bad news so it will make it difficult for people to deploy cash but it would be a good time to do so for those who are able to identify it.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes it will crash. We printed way too much fiat money and hyperinflation is all loaded into assets, particularly stock. The amount of currency no longer matches production.

Additionally, in terms of student debt and mortgage forbearance --  People will have to keep paying back their debt after the lockdown ends, and their monthly payment will be slight more than before the lockdown. Are they saving money on the side? -- Clearly no. Look at the stock market, look at the crazy high Disney+ subscription numbers on par with the high unemployment numbers, even look at the people around you getting a dog or cat instead of saving money (no offense to pets). 

This is totally my guess, but I think the crash will happen after July 2021. This is after people finish spending their stimmy and tax return money, and things start to open up and unemployment number starts to go down. These incompetent assholes in the govt will think things are ""turning around"" and they will raise taxes and raise rates, and all hell will break loose."

Market leaders for all forms of communications, and investment in major infrastructure like security to support such communications, are considered to be Microsoft and RingCentral, and Zoom will be exposed as they face this increasing competition while building out services in areas where these other companies have been investing for years and years."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I have a feeling that the initial security concerns around zoom may have doomed it. It was an opportunity for other providers to push their alternative solutions that were more secure, and I don’t think zoom did a great job of showing how they would close the gap"

But having said that, you don't know where that money is necessarily going to go. The market was bolstered by trillions of dollars last year being injected into the market. It was artificial growth.

So there's nothing to say that the end of that financial injection could not be the catalyst to bring it back down.

I'm just saying that these facts that you state don't translate that simply into future events. Economic forecasting has shown that throughout time.

It is a decent probability, but the world economy is way more complex than that."

I also agree that we're in a euphoric stage right now, but the party's going to continue a little while longer.

03/15/2021,stocks,"A question from someone not as smart as the rest of you... 

If many companies and stocks are overvalued but we're currently undergoing a huge devaluation of the dollar, wouldn't that mean that the ""overvaluation"" problem could simply work itself out? Company ""X"" might not be worth 2 trillion in 2019 $$ but fits right in with 2 trillion of 2021 $$."
03/15/2021,stocks,"This was a great perspective, I agree that I think valuations are out of this world, but I also believe maybe they're meant to be that way, and it could just keep continuing to be out of this world. We are in a pandemic, but I think when you're at such a low point, there are significant more ways it can go up than down. If prices can skyrocket in a terrible economy, imagine how much it can rise in an actual great economy, and I think many are buying to price in for the recovery, now at this point it's more about having the recovery actually happen. I also believe eventually it'll crash, but issue is it's very difficult to time for it, and could potentially just keep rising another 50%, before crashing only 25%, only to realize the crash was smaller or even insignificant, compared to the actual rise between now and then."

I agree with the Musk madness... But the market as you know is forward looking that's why it's at all time highs even as we are still in a pandemic... due to all the money that has been printed there is a huge expectation earnings will sky rocket in the next years

I don't encourage investing in insanely valued companies as well..."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I've been thinking the same since late 2018 so I waited for a crash to enter the market (timing the market...) and well, nothing happened, so I entered mid 2020 and I can't say I don't regret entering sooner (planed to enter on the GAFAM + Tesla).  
So now, I'm just hoping it doesn't crash, even if we are a few ""days"" out a crisis."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Agreed. I would say we are somewhere in between euphoria and denial. The volatility of the last few weeks was a warning sign. So are the rising yields, rising dollar value, meme stock explosions. Over the last year, we saw a huge boom in the market despite a pandemic, massive unemployment and 8+ million people entering poverty. Keep in mind that we are also not out of the woods wrt covid yet, but people are acting like it's back to normal. The only reason stocks have kept going up is the fed pumping trillions into the economy via stimulus. This stimulus may kick the can down the road a little further, but there won't be another covid stimulus and I think the market will start to fall when people realize that stimulus money will run dry."
03/15/2021,stocks,"How long have you been investing? If I look back like 15 years I remember some times I was scared to put in money near all time highs. The fear is always there lurking, but over a long time it proves to be overblown. I mostly invested in broad market funds. After you build a base, what happens on the daily with new money starts to become more like noise. If it drops a bunch this year it will help newer investors and ones with more runway until they need it accumulate as long as they continue to invest."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I was thinking about that idea few months ago. I agree with you. On my point of view, we can make the similarity with Great Depression and all last big bubbles. We can see now a correction on the market BUT we are on a rally of euphoria that will drive until pandemic ends. We be able to expend, travel and enjoy activities, that, before, we couldn't do. So, with that inflation I'm guessing that we be able to built a huge bubble that some will collapse. I don't know if I'll get wrong, but I would be very careful after the end of the next year...."
03/15/2021,stocks,">Everyone with a phone just invests in whatever without being aware of the company at all.

This is the reason we won't see another crash. The people with the phones are only increasing and they are waiting to pounce on even the smallest chance.

03/15/2021,stocks,">And when it goes down all the inexperienced investors with knowledge about the name of their stocks (but nothing more) will panic and sell which will cause a big drop

You say this but the vast majority of stocks are held by institutional investors. and the retail investors that are the top 10% and top 1% holding 80%+ and 50%+ of the stocks. maybe the top 10% are inexperienced, maybe so, but unlikely

i think everyone is ""drunk"" so to speak

and it's good to wait. we will see deflation in the stock market just like we saw in march. the pension funds and other financial institutions who are over-leveraged will pull out causing the market to tank. that will be a great opportunity for people who have some cash left to buy."
03/15/2021,stocks,>Pretty much
03/15/2021,stocks,My portfolio was positive in every month you mentioned... is more a problem of portfolio management... if you only own hyped and overvalued stocks you will feel the pain much more
03/15/2021,stocks,Probably more viable for fleet vehicles than consumer cars. I drove forklifts in a warehouse in college that were electric and they had a big battery swapping rig for whenever we ran out of charge. If you can control the supply and maintenance of the batteries within your own ecosystem it could definitely be useful and faster for on-the-go charging options.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Battery swap is only good for short/medium terms. It's not a viable solution as it requires a lot more space and maintenance than just a charger (and so the cost is much more important).

The actual solution to long charging is... short charging. And everyone is pulling their hair at this. We have QuantumScape (backed by Volkswagen) who claim that they will cut to <10min what takes >25min to charge today by 2025. It's still far from the 3min battery swap. Which means that battery swap has an actual value today and at least for a few years.

The future is probably making a major breakthrough in batteries and dropping Lithium-Ion for something else... ?

As for the quality of the battery, well obviously it behoves the stations' owners to make sure the batteries are fine.  But it's not an issue in itself. Everybody uses overused beds from AirBnB or hotels, and that's just fine. Nobody is going to question the market for this ""issue"", right?"
03/15/2021,stocks,It depends on the market... the us hates battery swaps.. asia doesn’t
03/15/2021,stocks,"Battery swapping was the way ev's were done in the 1890's. I believe it's still a viable option, but it does complicate things a bit. Where I could really see it shine are with big trucking companies. Eg, Fedex could swap out the batteries and keep going vs having to wait. 

For consumers, it lowers the initial price since they are not really buying the batteries, which in theory would sell more cars. FMU, they can still charge at home. Still a logistical mess since not everyone will take the option of replaceable packs, at least with Nio."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Issue in China, most people live in apartments so home charging isn't an option. Furthermore, it's less likely for current superchargers to meet EV demand in china. There's less superchargers, they're harder to get installed (grid demand is less secure than in US) and at worst, NIO provides a valuable stop-gap solution.

I do worry about their long-term prospects, and branching out into other markets. But it's important to remember, the NIO doesn't have to be batt-swapped. It just can be."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I agree I have been questioning my proportionatley large position with them, since this last pull back. Battery swapping isn't the option that I would choose If I had an electric car. On the other hand charging seems limiting. Oil is going back up. I have been looking at Canoo basically subscription cars but there isn't a way to compare pricing of buying case for your dinosaur and and charging you battery acid."

03/15/2021,stocks,"\> the market and the economy as a whole is acting 1:1 to 1929  


How so? It really isn't. 

You can find articles from years ago touting the same claims: doom & gloom, crash & burn - ""the next 1929!"".   
Yes, stocks are overvalued sure, but that's about where the similarities end. Over-valued stocks have always existing (in all bull markets across history, and the bulls are in play most of the time)

**But, humoring your sensational claim:**  


* Irving Fischer famously stated just weeks before 1929 crash: ""stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau."" ---- Nobody today believes anything is ""permanent"" nor a plateau. Risk aversion is real and trading is more mature. There were far less rules in place and people were borrowing tons of money to throw into stocks. 
* Logarithmic scaled all-time graphs for major indexes show that the upwards trend is stable. Big outliers are the mid-late 90's bubble and 2008 bubble but the last couple years are nothing like the couple years before the 29 crash
* The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (SEC established)
* The Banking Act of 1933 
* Tons of resources and open information to non-insider investors. Overall much better visibility into ""what"" people are investing in. 
* Social security reform, easing retirement draws
* 1929 had a longer trade week and overall much more of a ""free ride"" nothing barred trade-at-will mentality. 
* Inflation is far less volatile and tightly controlled/monitored
* People don't care as much about drawing out cash, even in the event of an emergency. Back then, online banking, online bill-pay and instant transfers from institution to institution didn't exist.  


Unless you're close to needing raw liquidity on your investments... you'll be fine. If you need raw liquidity, you need to account for that in your portfolio. Always zoom out and don't forget to account for inflation/logarithmic trends."

Ok, so value is now at PE 30 and high growth tech is at 32. I know where I’d put my money."
03/15/2021,stocks,Same. I think OP is right in that we shouldn’t expect another crash this year but I do think we are in for more volatility with the (expected) rising inflation numbers. JP will then probably make statements and then the market will rebound.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeesh. Market drops 10% and it's a crash.

Where did it go? Other tech and the big jumps this month.

What is happening? A correction as money gets moved around.

But run away from a 15-40% discount sale. Silly humans. Itll be fun when it's at 30-50% above ATH and they didnt buy in. I bought tesla at 568. ATH is 900. I'll take 1100-1400. Thanks."

The recovery needs to produce stellar Q3 numbers or outright inflation will takeover. Now I do not foresee a market crash if, and, when this happens.

03/15/2021,stocks,I wouldn’t call the current sentiment ‘overwhelmingly positive.’  There are a lot of people calling for a market crash right now from inflation and interest rate worries. I don’t buy into it and see this bull market extending at least until 2022.

You're applying ideas to a fluctuating chart. So why didn't zoom move down further and further in those months? Why would a company with diminishing prospects like you're talking about have risen so strongly in Jan and Feb, then? Everything you just said still applied all the way back to October. 

The answer is that these fundamentals and prospects don't really move prices in a reliable way that you can trade on.

The point of the economy is not to make money, but to distribute real resources to people living under the system.  The point of the fed is ""maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates"".  

Since the first objective is a long way off, no.  They should not be considering raising rates until such time as underemployment is low, the labor force is maximally utilized and unemployment is frictional.  Any other policy leads to suboptimal outcomes for large numbers of people."

For example, a lot of companies are international so they have to deal with different currencies. If the dollar is their main currency and it devalues, they can't buy as much things from a company who uses another currency because of the exchange rates. 

If the devaluation is high enough all companies with fixed rates will have problems (multi year subscriptions) but a supermarket could grow it's prices accordingly.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the understanding, likewise for your post!

What you are pointing out is for me exactly the big risk. The markets have 'huge expectations earnings will sky rocket'. If these earnings don't, which is a possibility because of:
- The pandamic
- Interest rates
- Climate change problems (regulations or adaptation costs
- Increasing taxes for companies (The pandamic money has to be paid by someone)
- Trends like unrest, increasing price of resourcesor other costly trends that are at least imaginable

Then the valuations are way too high and the market will correct. I understand they are high because of future expectations but that's exactly what is risky. I expect them to be too high because there are too much possible risks. Sure maybe they make the expectations but even if they do, is there much room for stock price growth when the valuations are already high?

03/15/2021,stocks,">	But run away from a 15-40% discount sale. Silly humans.

When people see a rollback of a few months of gains as a wonderful “discount sale”, maybe it’s time to get worried.

You know what is silly? To have all this faith in the stock market, something you have zero control over.

You know which is the “rotation” you should fear? Not this little move from tech to value stocks. It’s the rotation from the stock market to the real economy. That in which the market suddenly lose 50%+ of its value, while the price of real property like houses suddenly doubles or more.

Productivity creates real wealth. Inflated stock prices are only a sign of inflation. If we look at the economy as a whole, the wealth in stock ownership may turn out illusory.
Sure, a group of people with money can bid the price of a banana to the moon if they keep buying it from each other. But in the end bananas aren’t a direct solution to all of life’s necessities.

So now everyone is putting money on the stock market and stock prices soar. Great! Let’s assume this makes everyone’s net worth double in a year.
What happens when everyone decides to use their profits to buy a house? What happens to house prices?

Someday the stock market may crash so badly that most people decide to get out of it and buy property instead, which will cause the inflation to move from the stock market to the real economy.
If or when that rotation happens, it will cause real pain to the blind believers in the market,  the latecomers in getting out."

## What Is a Bear Market?

A bear market is when a market experiences prolonged price declines. It typically describes a condition in which [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) prices fall 20% or more from recent highs amid widespread pessimism and negative investor sentiment. Bear markets are often associated with declines in an overall market or index like the S&P 500, but individual securities or commodities can also be considered to be in a bear market if they experience a decline of 20% or more over a sustained period of time—typically two months or more. Bear markets also may accompany general economic downturns such as a recession.1"

03/15/2021,stocks,"Woah woah woah... time out. This will take a moment, so bear with me.

First off, where you been at the past few years... under a rock? 

Housing prices have almost doubled in the past 3 years and tripled in the past 7. I'm talking houses that should be 110k are selling for 240k. Houses that should be 280k are running 460k. That's just my area. Look at California and New York. In some cases, you see 4x values in 5 years.

So this is all fine and dandy, but you're right... eventually the piper must be paid. However, if you're balls deep in the market, you're gonna expect a bit of burn. That comes with gambling. I'm not making a claim of financial advice, but if you can read, you'll know what the purpose is. This is a place to help people learn, so your input is valued.

Also, since you brought it up... what happens when the good-will ends in a couple years? Taxes go flying upwards, the markets worldwide starts crashing, and people dont make enough to cover the expenses created while buying that home... Foreclosures. Which means that hot market gets tempered. It's all cyclical. Money is here a few months or years, then moves there. And the cycle repeats.

Im not trying to downplay what you said. Because theres alot of truth in your words. If you notice, I was talking about stock sectors. 

Now... If you're trying to dump some REITs off, I'll buy some... later... when those REITs get dumped and before the flood of money comes back in. Btw I think materials might be important too. You kinda cant build a house without those. And you need services like electric and water. And you need food. 

Cyclical patterns."

Take my favorite stock right now, ON semiconductor, for example. They provide about $500 worth of chips in every internal combustion engine car sold today. For EVs, they provide about $1000 per car. With the global chip shortage, they are selling every chip they can make (and improving margins). EVs are only 6% of the market right now but we are transitioning to 100%... that’s a long growth runway. 

So, what does this have to do with bond yields / interest rates?  Exactly. 

You could argue on the margins that maybe some people might not buy an EV because the loan is slightly more expensive, but I think they would just buy one with slightly fewer options."

I am lost at words lol. You're taking a position like I'm trying to used biased articles-- how do you read this and think it's a shill/fluff piece?? You either have no reading comprehension or didn't read anything. I'd honestly say the last two pieces are way more in favor of not holding much cash lmao...

1. Investopedia article: Why the fuck are you talking about BRK vs Nasdaq performance? It says Warren Buffet (famous successful investor) is an advocate of holding cash. It says holding cash gives you more liquidity to make aggressive moves, which is pretty much a fact. IDK how you see think this is relevant to BRK's performance. Investopedia also has several articles about why you shouldn't hold too much cash-- they're not shilling both sides, they literally are giving objective reasons to choose either strategy. When the predominant philosophy on the sub is to hold 0 cash, I think it makes sense to post other viewpoints.

2. thebalance(?) article: *For investors with less than $500,000 in net worth, and who are at least 10 years away from retirement, it can make sense to keep your brokerage account 100% invested in equities, either directly or through funds of some sort. However, this should only be done if you have an emergency fund at the local bank.*
3. Fool: besides their extensive ""When it's a bad idea to stash cash"" section, final closing statement: Otherwise, without a compelling reason to stash more cash, you'll probably be better off in the long run by looking for opportunities to invest the money that comes your way. The market has always been frothy, but only those that managed to invest through the short term pain have been able to reliably partake in the subsequent long term gain.

I am not a shill. I want people to be informed. There are valid reasons to hold cash and valid reasons to be fully ~~vested~~ (Edit: invested). TBH I'm slightly offended that you can take some pretty unbiased articles and frame them in a way that makes it look like I'm pushing an agenda, this shit is why our world is so polarized."

Why tf do I have to respond to that question lol? That wasn't the reason I replied, I honestly have close to 0 cash rn and agree with the majority sentiment that if you are young and have the risk tolerance you should probably invest as much as you can. I don't disagree with you so imo there's no point in responding to the rest of your post, they are valid reasons for not holding cash. You just don't seem to be able to concede that there are, in fact, reasons that **some** people would hold cash. These reasons are good to know and can help people in other situations than you.

> Talking about emergency funds is fluff. Having cash for regular transactions is a no shit thing. That has nothing to do with our investment accounts. That's financial management, not investing.

Ok maybe for you LOL. This is a stock subreddit, many people are making their first trades in meme stocks with no emergency fund. Some people trade like you do. Others are day/swing trading and might want to hold more cash when there's short term volatility or buying opportunities. But bro if you haven't been seeing the ""I've put my entire savings into X meme stock"" how can it hurt just linking people to more literature? i 100% think every new trader should determine their emergency fund and then dump most into investing, sounds like you do too so why are you against this lmao

Yes those are strategies, I'm glad you are using them. They're solid for people who also are using your strategy. I use those strategies/mindsets **for my long term holds**. I also day trade some stocks and it's stupid to not have any cash to make moves. I also have had some personal paranoia at times and held more cash **for peace of mind**, I was ok with missing some gains. Again `No one in investing ever says, hold cash.`.

03/15/2021,stocks,"The fund receives dividends from the companies they own, but those dividends aren’t paid out to investors. They get re-invested or held as cash until there is a good buying opportunity.

About the best explanation you’re going to get."
03/15/2021,stocks,"As a long term investor in leveraged ETF, you can make a lot of money if you trade on trends.

The best example is the long term trend still in place of the Nasdaq 100 outperfoming anf S&P.

The 3X ETF for QQQ is TQQQ with an inception date of 2/9/2010.

Since that date through this past Friday's close, QQQ is up 724% and TQQQ is up 10,805%.

The annualized numbers are: QQQ 20.93% and TQQQ 52.60 %.

All of the issues, decay, slippage, rebalancing, are quantified in the fact TQQQ did not return 3 times QQQ 's return.  It failed to meet its objective by 10.19%.

But I could care less.  I dont lose money if it only returns 52% per year instead of 60%.  Did decay cost me 10% per year? Yep. Again, dont care.

I plan to hold this trade for years or until the S&P starts to outperform QQQ."
03/15/2021,stocks,"At high leverage ratios, volatility will become very significant and will hurt your returns. Historically, the optimal leverage was about 2x, and this beats the market by about 1% annually on average. But these leveraged ETFs also charge about 1% in fees, so it’s not worth it."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I was listening to a podcast recently, and one of the guests was speaking about positioning and the size of your positions. The basic idea was that it's better to be correct with the wrong position size rather than be incorrect with the right position size. The argument was the following: suppose it's 1920, and someone (for argument's sake a fortune teller) tells you that the market **will** return on average 8% per year for the next 100 years. You would think that it would be a good idea to leverage up maybe 2x or 3x because a fortune teller basically guaranteed an 8% return per year (on average). If you had leveraged up, during the crisis of 1929, you would probably be wiped out, therefore miss out on the returns thereafter because your capital was wiped out and you have nothing to invest.

I've also heard the argument that leveraging up when you're young could help you build wealth and if you were to go bankrupt, you have more time to build your wealth up again. So I'm not against leveraging up, but there's a time and place for it. Or at least don't go all in, but rather have a small position to complement your portfolio."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think they make sense following a crash... if you had invested in FNGU at the bottom of the covid crash, you would have 10x your investment in a year. They don't make sense at an ATH like we have now."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Depending on your age (and risk aversion) it may make sense.

There are studies that young people would be better off in the long term if they use margin/borrow to put money into productive assets, equities/stock index in this case. Sure, in a crash like March 2020 you will lose much more when leveraged but it will be compensated by the following rise - i.e. you would've made a fortune even with using a little bit of leverage in Q3 and Q4 2020.

Also remember that to compensate for 20% drop you must make 25% back. After 25% drop you must make 33% back. After 50% drop you must make 100% back. After 75% drop you must make 300% back and after 95% drop you must make 1900% back.

That said, leveraged ETF, especially something like triple-x Nasdaq may not be the best solution. If you want leverage there are better options - futures or simply using a margin your broker offers."
03/15/2021,stocks,">, but wouldn't you be much better off investing in a leveraged index rather than a normal index?

No. Leverage is a double edged sword. It can enhance your returns, or it can cost you the shirt on your back. 

>but in the long term, isn't it going to be 3x,4x, etc more profitable to invest in one of these?

Leveraged investments aren't designed to be held long term, because of a phenomenon called decay. These leveraged funds are also reset daily, and charge higher than average expense ratios."
03/15/2021,stocks,"If your time horizon is long and you can accept volatility, I see no problem with it.

I've been invested in the triple levered TQQQ since 2011.

I think someone on the Bogleheads message board ran backtesting experiments on a [60% UPRO/40% TMF portfolio,](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=288192) and over the long run, it performed really well."
03/15/2021,stocks,"[http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php)

worth a read. tldr: 3x S&P 500 and 2x Nasdaq yielded the best return"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I know a lot of others have given similar answers already, but my 2 cents:

It's because losses being multiplied is much more impactful than gains being multiplied, even though that sounds unintuitive as first glance.

As a very extreme example: a $100 ETF goes up 30% one day and down 30% the next day. That ends at $91.

A triple leveraged version of the ETF starts at $100 as well, and goes up 90% one day and then down 90%. That ends at $19.

Leveraged ETFs just get absolutely clobbered by bad days.

Edit: of course, the caveat to that is that if there's no bad days, it's all upside."
03/15/2021,stocks,That’s no different from taking out a pay day loan and increasing your index holdings by 3x
03/15/2021,stocks,"All ETFs are supply-and-demand driven, just like stocks. While non-leveraged ETFs track their respective benchmark more closely, they will still have the ability to under or out-perform."
03/15/2021,stocks,Leveraged indices aren't a thing. You mean leveraged etfs.  They aren't long term investments.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Thanks, that's actually a good explanation."

I am intending to start a position in Apple.
In addition to the classic $AAPL, I found $APC which seems to be the same but in Euros in Germany.

Since I live in Europe, would it make more sense to buy it in my currency?

I am new in investing and finding the whole thing really fascinating.

Thanks."
03/15/2021,stocks,"What's the European stock market, and how do I get on there?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"The reason why it is in euros, is because you buy it from a european exchange. This does not make any difference as they also need to get it in dollars to sell it to you in euros. The exchange price of euros and dollars effects you in both cases. But you should alsways buy the stock on its „home exchange“ as volume there is the highest."
03/15/2021,stocks,Buying in your currency means you’re not gonna get fucked by forex changes but I still prefer buying American personally
03/15/2021,stocks,"It depends on your own jurisdiction too. I'm also from Europe, and while the exchange rate fee can eat away at your profits, when it comes to e.g. dividend-paying companies, Germany can be a hassle in terms of them withholding tax on your dividends, since then you also get taxed in your own country and you have to request your taxes back from the German tax administration. It's not impossible or even very difficult, but it can be tedious. 

I'm currently buying U.S. stocks because of the weak dollar in relation to the euro. If the dollar goes back down to the 1e = 1.1 USD or so region, that's like almost a 10% profit on just currency alone."
03/15/2021,stocks,"It's probably better to buy APC on a local German exchange if you can. For one thing, you won't lose on the currency exchange spread with every transaction. But I would also check your broker's rates and see if there is a commission fee difference."
03/15/2021,stocks,I use Degiro as broker and it works in Euros.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Nice explanation. Thanks.

However, I think that buying in dollars may be a double edged sword. If the rumours are true about it's real inflation, it could be problematic."
03/15/2021,stocks,Fees are higher on European Stock Market on Degiro. Usually 0.5-1 EUR fee for US stocks and about 4 EUR for European stocks.
03/15/2021,stocks,"True, every currency has its risks. Although I'm not too optimistic about Europe either.

2021-03-15 14:50:57,stocks,"What's your opinion on ETSY? I've been holding ETSY during the last few months and I've made some decent returns. I genuinely like the company and I think they own the handcrafted goods niche. However, I'm afraid that they're massively overvalued at the moment. The way I see it is that the pandemic has pushed their stock price up massively - this is not unexpected. Many people that have artistic talent have been fired from their jobs; in an attempt to make a ends meet, they have focused on selling handcrafted items on Etsy. On the other hand, many other people are stuck indoors and bored, so they end up buying cool little trinkets from Etsy; I personally have spent more than 500$ on stuff from Etsy this pandemic. This resulted in massive growth.

But, I can't really see this growth being maintained after most people get vaccinated and we resume our normal life. I'm talking out of my ass here, but I can see the stock price dropping to \~120$ in the next 4-6 months.

What do you think?

Edit: Positions: 180$ on ETSY"
03/15/2021,stocks,Only 1/5 of all spending is online. I believe that more spending will continue to grow online and that ETSY selling unique goods will help this.
03/15/2021,stocks,"This is said about a lot of good stocks. Think of last year as a preview of the future.

Just because we're excited to go to the beach this summer doesn't mean the future is going away. The last time I was at the beach, before the pandemic, I still had my phone and laptop with me, you know?

I don't think the future of jobs is looking great with automation, so I wouldn't be worried about people grinding less on selling crafts if you were ever truly long on etsy."
03/15/2021,stocks,"It's important to differentiate between companies that have seen a temporary benefit from covid, and companies that have seen future growth pulled forward because of covid.  People often make the mistake of confusing the two.

For example, Clorox has seen huge growth during COVID thanks to increases in sales of bleach and other disinfectant products.  That's a temporary benefit.  When covid is over the sales of those products will drop back down closer to historical levels.  People aren't going to use those products as often as they did during covid on a permanent basis.  Zoom is another example.  While people and businesses will continue to use zoom to some extent on a permanent basis, there is no chance they will continue to use it as often as they did during covid.  And certainly no chance they use it more (that's impossible).  That's why Zoom has sold off in such a big way, and may be headed for further drops when future earnings reports show big drops in growth.

But there are lots of companies that fundamentally change the way we live and work and were headed towards strong growth anyway, but that growth was sped up during covid.  ETSY is a good example of this.  E-commerce is the future and as soon as people become comfortable shopping online, they're not going to suddenly stop as soon as they can go to stores again.  Not when you can find exactly what you want online and have it delivered quickly and easily.  These types of companies may see temporary pullbacks, or even basing patterns, while investors get a feel for their post-covid growth rates.  Those are good buying opportunities for these companies."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think you are correct that the pandemic has bred the perfect conditions for a company like Etsy. Disposable incomes have grown, whilst at the same time people are largely inactive and trying to put creative talents to use. I haven’t really done due diligence on the company or market, but it does have a high PE."
03/15/2021,stocks,I bought Etsy at a good price in June for my daughter's portfolio.  I consider it a long-term hold.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I really like Etsy for custom gifts. They gained a lot of traffic as E-commerce did for the pandemic, but in terms of growth I'm not sure I see that continuing as strong post-pandemic."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I also own Etsy. It’s incredibly expensive as a company but it’s priced so high because the market expects huge growth.

Think of it this way: ETSY has a $28 Billion market cap. Do you think that’s too high or too low? Should it eventually overtake EBay ($38 billion)? Will ETSY ever be a $100 Billion company? 

The short term price movement is mostly noise if you believe the company you own has a path to X market cap and X sales/earnings/cash flow."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think it only got pulled forward at an accelerated rate because of covid, and will continue to grow after.  Although I could see another pull back in a lot of the “stay at home” stocks as the reopening continues, it will rebound and continue to push ath’s shortly after.  People, sleep on their ad model with their sellers and synergy with Pinterest.  I think it pushes close to $300 by the end of the year, if not higher."
03/15/2021,stocks,"It might drop momentarily, but I think ETSY has a good chance of overtaking Ebay and it's really the premiere market for handcrafted items. With folks working to support local/independent retailers, I think this one is here to stay and will continue some strong growth. Just my feelings."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I own it at $100, personally I think it's a great company and stock, but overvalued at this time. It was $30 and suddenly jumped up to around $250 at the high, in a single year, which I don't think the company grew at a rate that justifies going up 8-folds. Also put in perspective, it's about $210 as we're speaking. There are people not too long ago that bought at $30. The effort it would take to 2x your investment and hit $420, in this timespan early comers will have gone up 14-folds, which is absolutely possible, but just know anyone entering now is assuming a lot of risk. I think long term it'll make lots of money, but if you're looking to profit a reasonable amount short term, then it becomes debatable."
03/15/2021,stocks,"At a glance, I don’t agree that it’s super overvalued or expensive. It’s currently trading at 16.5X sales. Lots of other tech stocks are trading at 30x or higher. Pinterest is currently trading at x26.5 and they aren’t even consistently profitable yet. So, to me this seems like a pretty good valuation. In fact it’s cheap enough that I added it to my watchlist because of this post. 

Again, this is just a quick look at financials. I have no idea what Etsy’s growth is looking like or what their management plans are for capturing more revenues. Not all cheap stocks go up. 

I **do** strongly agree about the risks after Covid. That’s the exact reason I sold off my shares of Pinterest at around $85. I plan on re-entering at a later date. Again, at almost half the valuation, Etsy doesn’t have nearly as much downside, but it’s a very valid concern. 

Assuming the management strategy and debt are fine (I did not look at either) I think it’s a pretty good play. 

I would probably take whatever position you were thinking of and buy half now. Between the tech-market correction and the post-pandemic risks you mentioned, there will probably be better opportunities later. But cheap stocks don’t afford too many chances and you don’t want to miss the bus entirely."
03/15/2021,stocks,Might not hold up well if the economy reopens
03/15/2021,stocks,No way Etsy continues to grow in popularity
03/15/2021,stocks,"That's an interesting point of view. I do expect more and more people to get into coding as jobs get taken away by automation, but I do also see how more artist-types would prefer going into something like Etsy as a full time career"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think it continues to grind higher, regardless of high P/E.  From my experience, focusing too much on P/E keeps a lot of investors out of good companies they should own.  Etsy dominates its niche on artsy/small company goods.  I think there’s a big demand for this compared to the rather sterile/bland offerings on Amazon.  It will continue to take share."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I could see Etsy overtaking Ebay actually. Ebay really hasn't been keeping up with the times, and most of the vintage clothing there is just junk compared to the vintage that Etsy has."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I agree that PE as a standalone indicator to assess a stock's valuation is inadequate. The wider financials and growth prospects of the market should be considered. However, comparing the PE ratio to similar e-commerce businesses does provide some guidance. I believe it's a great company which will grow, however I don't believe financially it has the fundamentals to generate good returns at any point in the near future. That aside, the sentiment that other people believe it may do could be a good enough reason to invest."

Tesla is calling customers in Germany who have recently bought a car to buy it back from them at a great price if they buy a new one. Is Tesla trying to artificially boost its sales figures and at the same time get more subsidies from the state? Very strange for a company that claims to be production-limited. In the article it says:

&#x200B;

""An author from [teslamag.de](https://teslamag.de) also received a call last week with such a special offer from Tesla. For his six-month-old Model 3 Standard Range Plus (SR+) with just under 30,000 kilometres, he was offered an unsolicited 36,900 euros if he switched to a new model. The Model 3 SR+ currently costs 39,900 euros new, but you can deduct another 6000 euros from the environmental bonus.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Manufacturers do this across the board. You buy a new car from them, they buy your old car at a “great price”, although it’s not that great a price because you’ve just spent more buying a brand new car.
They shove their manufacturer approved sticker on your old car and sell it at a £5k profit, or whatever.

Very common on leased cars/pcp aswel in England"
03/15/2021,stocks,"It’s certainly possible they are trying to artificially boost sales figures.

It’s more likely though that the offer was targeted to the individual since they are an author for a Tesla magazine.

Tesla buys the Sr+ back for 37k euro, enable FSD in the car ( with 7500 Euro), and relisted it for $41k with easy $4k profit. Since it's a used car there is no artificial boasting of sales figure (VW does this with ID3 in Europe). 

Now, not sure if there is used EV incentive in Germany, the used Model 3 with FSD is certainly attractive to some buyers. 

Anyone who thinks Tesla is demand constrained are the same crowd who thinks competition is coming in the last 10 years."

Selling a used/refurbished car is an extremely lucrative business if demand remains higher than your current production can service and your inventory holding costs are low. 

Compare this with legacy automakers who go by the sell it once to a dealership model. 

People don’t realize how powerful Tesla is by being literally the only D2C auto company operating at scale in America.

I'd hazard the only people getting these offers are people who didn't buy FSD when they bought their Tesla so Tesla sees them as easy money."
03/15/2021,stocks,Tesla order rates are dropping. They're becoming demand constrained.
03/15/2021,stocks,"USA... land of greed and opportunity to make money off the weak.. it’s so hard for small businesses to survive. I love small businesses my self, but that’s another topic. But I am long tsla, don’t own a Tesla, would love too."
03/15/2021,stocks,Could be as simple as a single person trying to meet an internal quota..
03/15/2021,stocks,I see what you mean.  Yeah that’s pretty suspicious.  Sounds to me like you are right then - they are trying to artificially boost sales figures prior to Q1 closing.
03/15/2021,stocks,Who are these other persons? I have followed all things Tesla for years and havnt seen any posts about this. I havent gone searching for them but I think if this was common I would have seen. Maybe its 2 birds with one stone. Offer deals to influencers get free marketing. Barely costs them anything and boosts sales. It is not likely a demand issue though.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Not the OP, but this is pretty common in the US. It's usually individual dealerships, but they will send out trade-in offers to people who have bought new cars from them or have used their service center. My fiancee had a Honda Fit, which is being discontinued, so she was getting letters from the dealership with offers to buy her car pretty frequently. She eventually did trade it for an HRV in back in January, so I guess it worked, haha. 

Bottom line is this is not a bad thing for Tesla at all. We're reaching a point at which the owners of early Tesla models are ready for new cars, and they're simply trying to retain those customers and build brand loyalty. Plus more used Teslas on the market is a good thing too, because it means they're more affordable and start falling into more people's price range. It's very healthy for an automotive brand to have a strong used market.

Edit: I read it a bit more closely, and it is a bit odd that they're sending these offers to people who've owned their cars for less than a year, but, again, it seems like a way to build up the used market."
03/15/2021,stocks,It doesn’t matter that it’s happening in Germany. Tesla is an American company and most of sales and other tactics they utilize have been in play in the auto industry for decades. They might be the first or only ones doing thst in Germany the point folks are trying to make is that it’s common practice .
03/15/2021,stocks,"america, it happens a lot. in my situation, I bought a car the week before shutdown, since then ive put over 20k miles on it. The dealer offered me on the car and id only lose the warranty money i paid from when i bought it. I got it at a different dealer for a hell of a steal because i used the lockdown to my advantage when i negotiated my car. It also helps that my car was discontinued in august and people really like/want it now."
03/15/2021,stocks,Or they are protecting the brand by not having a lot of old used Tesla’s running around making the car seam “old” and tired etc
03/15/2021,stocks,What.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Model S is more than 10 years old (with minor changes: chrome –> black), they only have ""old"" cars running. And if so, what would they do with the car they bought back after half a year? Would be a total contradiction to being focussed on environment."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Tech and biotech were the first to really moon, so they seem to be correcting a little bit while big money is rotating into some other areas.  Surprised R2k stocks haven't corrected much yet, but they are probably next.

03/15/2021,stocks,What’s the absolute best biotech stock to buy right now ? Anything that’s gotten unfairly beaten down or oversold in your opinion ?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Stocks go up, stocks go down.   


For real, don't try to understand everything. Sector rotations happen all the time. You should instead focus on specific companies and at what prices you are willing to buy/sell them."

2021-03-15 13:31:15,stocks,"Why oil companies are still not at pre- covid valuations This morning I read the following article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/royal-dutch-shell-plc-fourth-070000026.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/royal-dutch-shell-plc-fourth-070000026.html)

For those who don’t want to read the whole article: Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS) will pay its shareholders a quarterly dividend of €0.1396 per A Share. Although it’s approximately only 33% of the pre-covid dividend, they have been paying dividends throughout the entirety of 2020, meaning that they were still profitable. A quick look in their figures ([https://www.shell.com/investors/investor-presentations/2021-investor-presentations/fourth-quarter-2020-interim-results-presentations.html](https://www.shell.com/investors/investor-presentations/2021-investor-presentations/fourth-quarter-2020-interim-results-presentations.html))  shows that although their free cash flow and earning decreased, they still made a net profit of $5 billion in 2020. And they have decreased their debt from $79 billion to $75 billion.

Where in the recent months the prices of many stocks have skyrocketed, the oil stocks only have seen small price rises, following the price of crude oil. Royal Dutch Shell is still 30% down in price compared to pre-covid times. These companies seem to have barely, if all have profited from the influx. Why is this? 

**My opinion:** 

The investors that have joined the market in the last year, are mostly idealists. Investing in futuristic, clean companies that “will improve the world”. Besides that, the aircraft industry is still no where near what it used to be, but once covid-restrictions start to be lifted, the aircraft industry will return inevitably. I feel like it’s mostly an image problem of these companies, they’re seen as old-fashioned, not hip and as oil companies. That last part couldn’t be less true. The example I have used Royal Dutch Shell, as well as many other companies that have their origins in oil, have been focussing on cleaner energy for a long while now. Royal Dutch Shell is working on hydrogen, solar power, wind energy and many other forms of clean energy. When the time comes that oil will be used less, they can smoothly transition into clean energy and use their advantage of the market position and experience they possess.  Let me know what you guys think!

Disclaimer: I am in the position of some Royal Dutch Shell, so my opinion may not be completely unbiased, but I bought the stock based on some of the opinions/facts I have expressed in this piece."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Oil company employee here, demand is no where near recovering. Covid remains a thing. Until the airline industry recovers the oil industry remains heavily constrained on ullage and throughput as you can't just produce fuel for cars and ignore other customers.

Also dividends does not mean profitability. We paid dividends too, we sure as hell didn't make a profit though."
03/15/2021,stocks,$CNQ paid their full dividend through the pandemic and have only been getting more efficient with their cash flow. They actually just increased the dividend by 21% (iirc).
03/15/2021,stocks,"Everyone around me is itching to travel. Take family vacations and what not. I honestly feel that travel is going to go back up in Summer once vaccinations speeds up. This is going to drive up the demand for oil. Developing economies have a lot of demand and the infrastructure for charging would still take ages. People care about saving cost and EVs are still too expensive than a $2000-$3000 used car. Also industries dealing in petrochemicals and their derivates thrive on oil. We can talk about moving towards plant based packaging and EV but until they scale up and be cheaper than what is being used today, it's going to be a long road ahead."
03/15/2021,stocks,"We all have to disconnect the idea that you and I were ever the ones using it all, that was / has never really been true.

I think when it comes to oil, people in cities look at their own consumption. But where does that food in the store come from? Your Amazon package? How is the food made?

World oil demand us currently down 6% from all-time highs with all this remote work, some countries locked down etc.

In other parts of the country it's all pickup trucks moving lumber and bricks and others stuff. All of this uses way way more gas than your car taking you to work."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Oil companies (bp & rdsb) are now the biggest part of my portfolio mainly for the reasons you covered. I've been focussed on post-covid bounce backs and sold all my airline (IAG) this morning as they're almost back to pre-covid prices when accounting for share dilution (40-50% profit in 2 months). I think several sectors such as airlines now have the recovery priced in so won't go up much further whereas oil companies still have quite a way.

Like many people I felt a bit uneasy investing in companies responsible for so much environmental damage, but like you said, they'll be big in green energy as we move towards it and I personally think they're a safer bet for green energy because they have so much cash to put into r&d (not like multi-billion dollar companies will just give up and shut down once the energy market changes)."
03/15/2021,stocks,Shell and Suncor for me
03/15/2021,stocks,"I worked at the office. Covid taught a lot of companies a great forced lesson in benefits of remote work and I'm not going to be working at the office even after it's ""safe"" again. I live in a city and won't need a car, perhaps ever again. I finish work, take a walk and grab takeout food. I don't need to travel for work anymore too, meaning I'll be making 2 flights a year instead of dozens. The demand on oil my lifestyle generates will now be a fraction of what it once was. There are millions of people like me, this makes me happy and willing to go even further into making sustainable choices. This also motivates me to steer clear of oil stocks knowing businesses representing them lobby for regulations that go against my newly found interests. That's just my personal two cents though."
03/15/2021,stocks,"An EXTREMELY important statistic when evaluating oil companies is Cost per Barrel produced. This number dictates the companies profit margin for every barrel they make. The lower the cost per barrel means greater profit when the price of oil goes higher, and conversely, the ability to still turn a profit at lower oil prices. This number can also allow companies who produce less, to make more profit than companies who produce more. 

This is the primary reason that Buffett made such a substantial investment in Chevron, as they currently have the lowest cost per barrel of all the major integrated oil companies."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah I'm invested in shell and bp too. Atleast till they recovery to a certain level after that I will dig deeper about their current transaction from oil to gas and renewables.
I know shell is stepping up since last year with hydrogen infrastructure in Germany and BP with ev loading stations and other renewable projects."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Danger is they mess up going ""green"". Oil companies have a history of over paying and then taking write offs.

BP seems to have over paid in the offshore wind. Time will tell.

I have shares in bp and RDSB (don't live in USA so save 30%withholding tax), but I wouldn't buy shares at current price. Happy with dividend, and will offload slowly if I find better stocks to invest in"
03/15/2021,stocks,"My take as an Energy economist:

Yes oil demand has not yet recovered from COVID.

I think we will see ""peak"" oil demand soon - maybe 2023-2025 - much sooner than the markets are predicting.

The EV revolution is real - in a few years, we will have enough EV's on the road to start to move oil demand to a decline.

The above effect will favor solar, wind, energy storage, and natural gas.

Investor takeaways: Stay with O&G firms that make most of their $$ from NG. TSLA, FSLR, CSIQ, TAN, etc should be winners...

&#x200B;

ESP"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah, covid isn't over yet. The year turning to 2021 seems to make everyone think it's a magic integer that clears all disease. No. We are still very much in the middle of covid, if not the tail-end. We won't see any change for likely a few more months."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Fully agree with you. So ridiculous how people were saying that oil is doomed and will never recover because EVs and shit... Man, those people must live in a bubble - guess they have never seen any country other than their own 1st world one. No way Asia, Africa and Latam will transition to EV within the next decade."

03/15/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/15/2021,stocks,"Your confidence that oil majors can smoothly transition to other energy sources seems idealistic. Most are already carrying heavy debt, and the investment needed to transition to a completely different business model is also going to have a major impact on spend. That takes money away from current core operations, which means declining output over time, and thus reduced earnings power. Oh, and if they do pull off that transition what they’ll be facing on the other side is reduced margins, so more suppressed earnings potential. They have market share and money on their side, but they are less agile than small companies focused on renewables. The difficult balance an established company has to maneuver with is why you see disruption happen. When you factor in the previous failures/overspend on their energy transition efforts I believe the market is correct to be skeptical.

It’s easier to be bullish on oil companies who are focused on being oil companies in the near term, but even they are seeing a continued suppression of demand that we don’t yet know if or when that may take a favorable turn. I was a major oil bull last year, but at current prices expected returns look less attractive unless you believe the bull run on growth is over."
03/15/2021,stocks,Would you prefer an energy etf > a financials etf right now in terms of value? (Trying to hedge my tech heavy portfolio against the value rotation). Only thing that is holding me back is that that the oil price already is pretty high..
03/15/2021,stocks,"I suspect you're right, but I don't want to invest in oil. We're heading for a climate crisis, and I'd rather not make money off that."
03/15/2021,stocks,Why should we care. I hope they die soon
03/15/2021,stocks,Money they make comes from the oil price × volume. The price has been rising lately but the volume is still low. Last year did a lot of damage to the industry and there wasnt enough time for the recovery. Hopefuly none of the companies is on their knees.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think oil is a fine swing trade, but investors are starting to realize that private oil is going to be a dead industry in 25-30 years, and that’s not idealist as much as it is looking at industry projects and current regulations.

Peak Fossil Fuels is happening in the next five years, and as subsidies get pulled from the industry and infrastructure gets halted and permits revoked, the bottom will fall out of the entire industry.

Also if you actually believe any supermajor is sincerely investing in clean energy and speeding up the demise of its own profits, I have a bridge to sell you.

The majors do this every few years to get regulators of their back, but there’s a reason BP isn’t called Beyond Petroleum anymore.

Hell nearly the entire management of Shell’s clean energy projects resigned last year in protest of how little Shell was investing in them

03/15/2021,stocks,"This, I would like to add that many companies have had to write down billions of dollars in assets. It's hard for a company to get back to pre-covid levels when they're really trying to write size their internal portfolio."
03/15/2021,stocks,Very important point. Investors should also know that firms at times even take on additional debt just to pay dividends. Knowing the whole picture is crucial.
03/15/2021,stocks,Is that domestic demand for the US? I'd assume China and India would constitute a lot of demand but might not be getting it through many US sources. China was pretty recently trying to secretly buy oil from Venezuela and a few other places to probably not tick up the official demand as much.
03/15/2021,stocks,"thats the point, they are cheap right now and will rise to pre-covid levels within this year, which is a huge % return."

Somebody please tell me how we are supposed to jet around the globe without oil, run our factories without oil and build plastics without oil."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Not to mention that it takes 45 min to fuel an EV vs a few min at a gas station regardless of slightly higher gas prices. I think more people would rather pay for gas, keep their car, than to drop an arm and a leg to go EV and travel. There was a YouTube that had a Tesla but when they would travel past the range, he got tired of adding time to his commute to charge. So he got a Honda hybrid."
03/15/2021,stocks,I feel like the majority of the country is just traveling regardless. Probably a reason why we’re still actively dealing with the virus.

03/15/2021,stocks,"If you care about the environment make money on the oil reopening trade then put that money you stole from anti-sciencers back into clean energy and ARK to save the world. This environmentalist aversion to money is self defeating. Money gives you leverage to re-allocate resources in society. 

Agree on your second point as well. They are *energy* companies. These CEO's didn't dream of religiously bathing in petroleum their whole lives as children at any cost. They make huge R&D investments to be ready to transition when its economically favorable."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Same for me plus RIG and a commodities ETF that has \~30% in energy.

Suncor is looking great.  I thought I was going to have to wait six to nine months to get a 50% return.  It will probably hit that in April.  I am now more optimistic about getting 80%."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Depends on what you do, but I assume a lot of companies will go back to their old ways.

Also transportation is not the only oil demanding sector, especially a personal one."
03/15/2021,stocks,"That's purely anecdotal though. While it is well reasoned that quite a few companies will be increasing their pre-covid level remote jobs, there is not enough supporting evidence to say that all companies will drastically increase their remote positions to the point where oil prices will never recover."

03/15/2021,stocks,"As someone who works for an oil company. We are able to swap between drilling for natural gas and oil at will, depending on what's more profitable. While most companies' ability to do this depends on the acreage they own. This is also something to pay attention to. There may be more companies able to drill NG than most people realize."
03/15/2021,stocks,"The reality is with the increasing vaccinations , people are done with it. And as a pandemic, is is shrinking rapidly rapidly"
03/15/2021,stocks,Even here in US EV is only 4-5 percent of car sales. The gas cars sold today will be running for at least 20 years. Oil is not going to disappear before I sell my profits.

I can sea East Asia doing that but they also have more money.

Especially given you have to develop infrastructure for that too."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I agree, but you make money with either growing business or dividends. I must say growth has historically been a way better vehicle of wealth creation.

03/15/2021,stocks,"That's another reason oil hasn't recovered, ESG investing has been picking up a lot more support lately, especially during the pandemic. And oil companies are one of the most obvious anti-ESG industries there is due to their impact on climate change.

That and lets be real, sure oil might be undervalued today, but who thinks the oil industry will be worth more in the future then it was at it's peak, let alone significantly more? I think a lot of investors believe that EV's and renewables are going to cannibalize demand for oil over the next decade or two. Sure, it certainly won't ever cannibalize all the oil demand, but all it needs to do is eat a good chunk of it to cause some serious pain to the entire oil industry."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah but these companies are innovating as well and as they're the big players, the most change will probably come from them"

03/15/2021,stocks,"less competition for traditional oil, I call bullshit for RDS"
03/15/2021,stocks,Hi. May i know which region you are referring to? Im assuming by frac free you mean there hasnt been any new rigs drilling or do you mean that even pre-covid rigs are now offline?
03/15/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't bank on that. As a share holder myself I'm not expecting huge returns. A large part of this drop is seen as a correction to an industry with an uncertain future. 

On top of the cost of climate change for the industry there's the expectation that some 30% of air travel won't recover and that new investment will be needed to reconfigure refineries. 

I suspect the share price will recover but if it does it'll be for the companies that start adopting a green agenda and even then only in a few years rather than a get rich quick scheme."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I thought they already did? I've checked major airlines stock and they're back to the pre-covid value, some even higher."
03/15/2021,stocks,"No it can't. While we like to think of Jet A1 as a fantastically clean superfuel, the reality is it is a dumping ground for many nasties that are no longer permitted in diesel or heating oil, e.g. Sulfur where the Diesel component is measured in parts per million, and the A1 component is measured in Percent. 

Jet A1 overproduction has been the single biggest concern for much of the western oil industry."
03/15/2021,stocks,"My comments are that 2018 and 2019 were stagnant with a global consumption change under 1%, 2020 was a cluster fuck, and that the oil industry itself estimates that consumption will drop with two majors having already declared that 2019 was peak oil consumption and that the best case scenario for their future business is that there will be no change in consumption through 2030. Best case. Not worst case or expected case."
03/15/2021,stocks,"By ""oil"" you mean WTI? I don't see that happening. Oil hasn't traded that high since 2014. Both bp and Royal Dutch Shell's CEOs seem to think $60-65 is the new normal. 

That said Exxon's CEO seems to think it'll still go higher."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Well thanks to COVID so far they were right :-) But yes, 2019 saw the the first ever global stagnation in oil demand that wasn't spurred on by an external economic crisis."

03/15/2021,stocks,I think plug-in hybrid is a better way to transition. No range anxieties and still better than just the ICE vehicles.
03/15/2021,stocks,"BP and RDSB, I'm in the UK so go for the ones on LSE when possible since I don't have to pay tax on dividends or pay exchange fees (only 0.15% so no big deal if I have to). Also they have further to go to reach pre-covid, I'm guessing because UK has been in lockdown longer than the US and is generally a slower market."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Not heard of GUSH before and it's not available in the UK (only oil ETFs available for me are tied directly to crude prices). But it sounds like a great post-covid recovery play. When I've been looking at companies I've found US are \~15-20% below old prices and UK \~30% below and that's roughly where I'm aiming for (maybe a little bit less so I can move to more standard investments instead of waiting to squeeze out the last few %).

The standard advice for this sub of cashing out your initial investment & letting the profits ride seems like the safest bet if you're unsure."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Some will, many won't. This means a decline in demand. Travel, including business air travel was a big one, and it's never going to be back to where it was pre-covid. Now in hindsight it almost feels silly we had to wait for people to fly over to meet in person rather than just giving them a Zoom call when needed. Where I work is not going back to the old ways because they didn't make sense, they were just there because there wasn't anything to spark this change.

Sure, there will always be some need for oil, and some businesses are likely to still succeed, but they will be the outliers in a declining market. Maybe there will be short-term growth compared to lockdown days, but it's not going to go back to pre-covid days and will only decline from there."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Go back to their old ways... but Not very fast.  The economy they discovered will not be dropped. Competition would imply one company will try to undercut competition through better deployment of resources.  Travel isn't all that necessary. 

My sister's company will have been grounded 2 years before they resume the old ways.. then it won't be as often.  

BTW, the banking sector grounded international travel in January last year, not March. They saw it coming before governments did much. If you get a lead in their crisis management, you'd see when things recover.  So far, I hear not before September..."
03/15/2021,stocks,That's true bp was there way faster and smarter with their upcoming projects till 2025
03/15/2021,stocks,"Could be. I am still thinking we will see a peak value in 2022 that will be higher then 2018 - but not by much...


ESP"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the info. I have worked in the NG industry - mainly utilities, software ETRM stuff. I think NG will have strong demand going forward - more than oil - but as you say - in the USA, we have soo much gas- and plenty of firms willing to drill, drill, Frack, Frack, etc...


ESP"
03/15/2021,stocks,exactly that
03/15/2021,stocks,"Icln exploded based off a green president hype. If bills pass and transitioning is slowly happening then these stocks will go up more. Oil stocks are pretty much stagnant is the issue. Will they go up after Covid? Probably, but I don’t see them reaching their ATH or pre covid high"
03/15/2021,stocks,">  People are not saying oil is going bankrupt, just that it will probably shrink over time. 

Umm... some oil companies will 100% go bankrupt if demand for oil shrinks overtime and stays down long enough. The market won't be big enough to support all of them, unless they all somehow agree to cut production equally, which I highly doubt will happen, as it would actually benefit the oil companies if some of their competitors went under and the supply was reduced."
03/15/2021,stocks,Im in the US.  Do you know if i should buy one over the other?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Tobacco companies have been dying since the 80s yet for twenty five years they were one of the best investments you could have made.  They just kept paying out fat dividends and buying back their own stock.

All that green infrastructure will be built with oil.  They won't be using electric dump trucks, cranes, bulldozers, et cetera to do it."
03/15/2021,stocks,nobody said they have to reach ATHs again smh
03/15/2021,stocks,Does something have to die for something else to be born? Do you think there is no room for pivoting for the oil companies? Do you think they are blind to what happens with the world?
03/15/2021,stocks,"I admire your optimism, and I hope you're right!"
03/15/2021,stocks,">:)

:)"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Misconception is that that is all there is.


All these other countries that are growing need oil, everything needs oil, making clean ernergy requires oil.


Progression requires oil right now, and it still will require it for decades to come. Its not the future tech, but its what will get us to those technologies as its a necessity"
03/15/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/15/2021,stocks,"Let me rephrase that, the refinery can just stop producing Jet A-1 and send more distillates to the ULSD unit. If they have stock in the tank farm that's sitting they can probably reroute it to the ULSD unit without even needing any temporary pipe work. Jet A-1 stock won't bottleneck most refineries, hell a lot of them don't even sell Jet."
03/15/2021,stocks,"interesting, thank you very much for your input!"
03/15/2021,stocks,So stay away from oil companies until covid is officially over and all the travel restrictions are lifted ?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Nice I’ll check their charts. I got RIG at a dollar so I’m riding that one hard. I wish I woulda put more in on them but the whole, “end of the world” mindset at the time made me prudish"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Lets see, but I dont think we have peaked in the oil consumption yet.

Im not sure about your company, but in mine we have been dealing with most of the things online and travelling only when absolutely necessary already in the pre covid times. So nothing much has changed. Only thing maybe that I dont commute to work everyday like I used to. But I will again when its possible, but maybe not that often.

Big demand will come from the developing countries though. The ones which arent ready for electric, but already rich enough so people can buy a lot of cars + other goods included."
03/15/2021,stocks,"> Now in hindsight it almost feels silly we had to wait for people to fly over to meet in person rather than just giving them a Zoom call when needed.

It's amazing to me that it took COVID to make many things that people forsaw in the 90s and even as far back as the 1920s to make things like video calls more common.  Lots of meeting definitely never needed to have taken place with people being there in person.  Of course, it took time for internet capacity to build up to support it.  In the 2000s, bandwidth mean video was still very blurry compared to today where even youtubers have resolutions that look better than real life."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes, I assume that works for all the industries where there is no physical product. If you talk about production though, there is no way around it."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Oh, I believe you. I'm just not familiar with BP.  But XOM, Chevron etc aren't doing much."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Point is: they don't have to. RDS was around 25€ before the pandemic hit, currently sits at 17. Even if they never reach that again, I totally see them hit 20€ still. Which is not 50%+, but closer to a solid 20% which I am totally fine with.

Airlines are at ATHs - that is something that I feel is more concerning."
03/15/2021,stocks,Neither do I.  Oil is dead in that it’s golden era is done and it’s clear EV is the future but oil is still going to be around for a long time.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Eventually they will go bankrupt, i was having a different kind of time horizon in mind, like next 5 years"
03/15/2021,stocks,You want RDS.B if you are in the U.S.
03/15/2021,stocks,"No, but I think for a long time they've had a strong vested interest in making sure that we keep consuming fossil fuels in a way that is deeply harmful for us, future generations and the world."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I still have my suspicions though, and their track record ain't great!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell#Environmental_record"
03/15/2021,stocks,"There's a big difference between needing oil going forward and growing a business. We will always need oil. It underpins much of what we do, not the least of which it's in the cloths I wear and the keyboard I type on now. The question is, are we going to continue to set it on fire en mass even looking as countries the world over are aggressively compensating for it. In some cases depend on who you ask (even when asking oil companies themselves) there's a view that the other countries growing need for oil will be fully or over compensated by western countries abandonment of it. 
Both bp and Total have indicated the *best* case scenario for the oil consumption is that by 2030 we will be consuming the same level of oil, and the *most likely* scenario is that we as a planet reached peak consumption in 2019."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Well funny you should say that. https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/111220-refinery-news-roundup-refinery-closures-loom-across-the-globe

And god knows that isn't comprehensive. I know of two refineries in Australia that are missing from the list which were announced in 2020 for permanent closure as well. :-/"
03/15/2021,stocks,"No they can't. Sure they can technically but doing so runs the risk of running out of ullage for storage, capacity in units or worse hitting limits that are already hard to hit in other units. The linear program on a typical highly profitable large refinery is very restrictive even in normal times on what possible crude slate that can be run. They can't just magically at a flip of a button run differently as they are configured to operate with certain market constraints in mind. 

The market has seen huge shifts and demand swings in the crude slate in the last year because one of the very few handles a refiner has to meet supply constraints is to source a different type of crude. Previously already expensive crudes shot up in price even as the WTI dipped below zero. Much of refining capacity in Europe was running at minimum rates last year even as petrol demand increased precisely due to the constraints at work.

A few minor refineries may not produce jet, but they are hardly relevant on the balance sheet of an oil company. But quite critically, those which don't sell jet, are *designed* not to sell jet. In the meantime in my own company they decided to spend many 10s of millions to recommission two previous decommissioned claus units precisely because of issues such as not being able to process sulfur. In the time when we were running them we ended up paying people to take away products that we previously sold at a profit.

You can't just change the product mix of a refinery, and if you can you can't expect it to make a profit doing so."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Nice, seems like you jumped in at the perfect time"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I work in tech and still management needed covid to realize you can do everything remotely and it also saves a lot of money. Now management also knows people like it and they'll bleed talent if anyone's forced to go back knowing competition promises a choice. Plus previously it was the fear of the unknown, but now even management doesn't want to go back. This is generally what is happening in my extended bubble and what my friends' non-tech companies are going through too.

While I agree that what you mentioned in your last paragraph could be true, I wonder how quickly electric cars become so mainstream that by the time those developing countries are ready for a big boom in car ownership, most of those cars are electric. Besides, we see growing culture shifts against private car ownership, at least outside of North America. Maybe we'll see more countries like Japan or cities like Hong Kong where the economic boom leads them to the development of excellent public transportation systems instead, now electric and powered by nuclear or even renewables."
03/15/2021,stocks,"True.  So others consolidate trips as possible.. and put fewer people on the road.  Still suppresses demand while reducing exposure.  Oh, expenses drop, too."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah I think at some point all oil companies need to rethink their selling point/product but no ones knows when and in which region it all start. I know from my older brother who works at a big oil company ""baker Hughes"" that they needed to cut 1/3 of all employes and now thinking about shifting their products to geothermal and everything around it. (he studied geophysics)"
03/15/2021,stocks,Thanks.
03/15/2021,stocks,"As any other company. It's not healthy to stare at a computer screen 10 hours a day, yet you won't blame tech companies for it.

How do you know what's harmful for the future? We wouldn't have this conversation if there wasn't for fossil fuels. Of course it's not perfect (as with everything in this world) but it gives us the means to do something about it."
03/15/2021,stocks,Weren't they talking about peak oil a decade ago too
03/15/2021,stocks,"Allright, let's bust out the PID of the refinery you work at and see who's right."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Can you actually do everything remotly? Thats a personal question. Cause I believe there is benefit to working with a team in person, also the things you discuss at a coffee break or lunch have a certain value. I think it's a big mistake to toss it out of the window expecting the same performance (especially from the new comers)."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I just had a meeting with our global real estate team and saw their scenarios of cost savings through rent, energy, maintenance etc. It is a mind boggling number, any p&l manager who sees that won't go back to old normal. Of course, manufacturing, r&d etc needs to work as a team but not so much on sales and support teams. We are also cutting down internal expat roles as well, will be very limited international relocation. 
Smaller companies may try to go back to old normal but there will be a culture shift starting with larger multinationals."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Others have been doing it before the covid as well. I mean, travelling has never been cheap.

But I have to agree that there will be a lot of people reevaluating what is actually necessary."
03/15/2021,stocks,"They were talking about peak supply not peak consumption. The risk that we would very soon run out of oil, not that we would stop setting it on fire. Two very different things. 

Mind you the former was mostly spoken about those who don't know about the topic. The peak oil fantasy from (well over a decade ago now) was based on a trend that proven reserves weren't rising with demand. In the meantime the price increased, and low and behold a whole lot of new reserves were suddenly viable and supply increased to go with it. It makes a mockery of the peak oil concept.

/edit: To put the example in practice: The last time oil consumption went down was 2008 during the global recession. Yet 2018 consumption went down in the entire west, and 2019 consumption in asia slowed to the point that total growth in consumption worldwide was non existent (this all before COVID was a thing). This is the first time such a thing has happened in an otherwise healthy global economy."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Which one? I support 9. Each with different setups and different capabilities. One of them was printing cash like you wouldn't believe during the downturn many thanks to integrated chemical margins skyrocketing. 

But hey why even restrict ourselves to 9? We can compare the whole world if you look at the change in prices of the different crude slates. If you're right they should all have gone up and down at the same rate right? But they didn't. We can also look to international trading. If you were right we shouldn't have had tank ullage issues to the point where the industry even exhausted floating storage supplies, but we did. If you were right then the cost of retail fuel should have collapsed and stayed down the entire year, which it didn't."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I can do absolutely everything remotely. I sometimes miss the chats we had in person, but I think benefits of remote work far outweigh the cons for me, the only one being the more limited personal connection. The productivity on our team is actually much higher remotely and we can deliver work faster, while still having more energy and more time for things and people that matter outside of work.

Personally I believe the best way would be to offer a choice and allow people to stop by a (vastly downsized) office when desired. Some people care about this more than others. I'd probably stop by once a month or so myself to connect with those who chose to be there, perhaps organize some optional get-togethers too."
03/15/2021,stocks,I'm kinda wondering what how this is going to affect the real estate or actually the whole global workers market. If there is no issue with the remote working why would anyone stay in an expensive city and not by the beach somewhere cheaper? Or in a different country. Do you think it's going to flatten out the cost of living + wage gap among countries?
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm curious when a proper internet will finally reach the rural parts... Been paying $1 or so every month  on every line for a fund to provide universal access..  that isn't universal.  Been doing that for about 25 years...

03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes, but now imagine you are a fresh hire out of university.  Think that person develops their career and competency the same way?  I don’t think so for 99% of applications.  WFH can work, but it is a long term degradation"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Remote workers should be scared their job is going to be outsourced to someone living in a lower wage location. Might be someone in a lower cost of living area in the companies home country, or an international worker, but a lot of businesses are going to take a long hard look at why they are paying a web developer $30 an hour, when someone in Poland will perform the same job for a much lower wage."

So I find myself in a bit of an unenviable position. My dad's been saving up for retirement, and is now nearly sixty (I'm 31). He has a whopping $140,000 in his IRA, and has asked me to help him manage it since he's never done any financial work before. He is wanting to retire at 65, and seems to think, despite my repeatedly telling him otherwise, that the stock market is a magic money-making machine that will make up the difference between that, and the roughly 10 times that amount that he needs.

Still, I want to do the best I can for him, so I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for materials/resources that I could use to really learn what I'm doing? I've been working on my own IRA, but that's pretty exclusively been money going into target-date funds, I haven't had the time between work and family to really learn much beyond the basics of what to expect from funds and stocks vs bonds/foreign v domestic ratios."

I understand TQQQ undergoes daily rebalancing, but how does this affect me after I've already purchased the shares? As far as I am concerned, I cleared 310 shares at $91.05 for a total of $28,225.5 yet based on the changed information in my portfolio it suggests I paid $28,954 which I know is not correct. So in this case, did I actually pay the $28,225.5 and only my cost basis is being adjusted or am I also paying more on the backend for holding these shares?"

I doubled down on my BP calls

""I am really happy to report today that we’re planning to join forces with Volkswagen AG to expand ultra-fast electric vehicle (EV) charging across Europe.

We want to help more drivers make the switch to EVs by ensuring there is charging infrastructure to support them on the road.
That’s because the stress of running out of battery before your destination is one of the biggest barriers to greater EV adoption.

And who better to team up with to solve this problem than one of the world’s great automobile manufacturers?

I had a great chat with their CEO Herbert Diess on Friday about the deal and shared how much I love cars. My brother has a Golf Mk 1 GTI – it’s worth googling 😁 a true classic!

The proposed deal will see bp becoming VW’s EV charging partner – meaning the new charging network will be integrated into VW vehicles so your nearest charger is easy to find.

With 90% of people in the UK and Germany living within a 20-minute drive of our bp & Aral stations, we expect that to significantly improve accessibility.

And charging will be quick – in a time broadly as fast as refuelling at the pump.

Together we can get more EVs on the road, work towards our respective net zero goals, and take advantage of a rapidly growing market – all at the same time.

The reason for interest is that it is a relatively cheap stock that I could potentially buy a moderate amount of shares in, and that it's very new to the NYSE, in my experience with step children and nieces & nephews, as well family friends children, they all play Roblox under the age of 10 play the game and watch endless YouTube videos of people playing the game as well.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Let's back up 3 months. I, a big player in the market, own 100 shares of XYZ. Melvin comes to me and wants to borrow them so he can short. Cool. I lend him the shares, he pays me interest daily. The price climbs and climbs. Melvin panics. This is all well and good, and what we expect to see with some stocks right now.

The ""plan"" on some subs is to hold for $10K, $100K, $500K, $1M per share, right? Which all of us want to see. But that's where my question is....

The price keeps climbing, and Melvin knows he's screwed. Suppose he buys one share at $10K. He returns that share to me, but he still owes me 99 more. What's to stop me from selling him that share at $10K? He can return it to me again (now he owes me 98), lather, rinse, repeat until he's returned all 100 shares to me, 99 of them were purchased from me at $10K each. Doesn't that mean that the price gets locked in at $10K (or whatever he and I have agreed on), and retail investors never see their big payday?

As the owner of the shares, I may agree to this because Melvin's a friend and I would rather take a smaller profit than to see HF money end up in retail hands. If I can keep the money out of retail hands, that may convince a lot of retail investors that they don't actually know what they're doing and they'll stay out of my sandbox next time, right? Melvin knows he's going to lose a ton of money, but losing a small ton of money to a friend is better than losing a big ton of money to retail investors.

What am I missing? I understand the concept behind the squeeze, but that requires that everyone hold as long as possible. As soon as a few shares start being traded, why couldn't the original owner sell those shares back to Melvin over and over to limit the upside for the rest of us?

Edit: I'm not surprised by the downvotes, but if it's a legitimately dumb question, please help me understand why."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Sony (SNE) DD. First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                
 
Next is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about ""other "" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  

Next is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           

Next is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           

Next is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. 

Next is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. 

Now I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               
 
Next is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. 

Lastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask. It's a kind of simple DD but I can elaborate on certain sectors you are interested in

I'm biased as an owner of a whopping 3 shares @ 100 lol but I'd say so. It's not going to go up bigly fast like some other growth/meme stocks but it's a winner in my book."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I personally believe MSFT will continue to be a good buy for a long time if you hold long term. Got my dividend off them today and they're one of my largest holdings. MSFT have their hands in a lot of car companies (volkswagen most recently for example), something I think will only increase as car technology continues to grow. Their xbox game pass side of things is also phenomenal. Lots of room for their cloud service to continue growing in use as technology advances with them. When someone needs a large reliable company with resources for Cloud supply, MSFT are that company. That's not even going into SpaceX involvement, contracts with the US department of Defence, and additional commercial products."

03/15/2021,stocks,Wish I bought at $13 like I was planning to. Too late now. I learned my lesson to not FOMO into a stock for emotional reasons.

03/15/2021,stocks,I can't find it right now but I was reading a Vanguard article that stated there's a slight advantage to investing it all at once. Something like 64% of the time you'll earn more by doing that. I think having some money aside for dips is sensible though.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'd say. Put 70-80% of it on a good ETF and use the rest over time to buy dips of companies you truly believe in. Not financial advice, just the way I do it."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Sony (SNE) DD. First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                
 
Next is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about ""other "" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  

Next is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           

Next is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           

Next is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. 

Next is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. 

Now I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               
 
Next is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. 

Lastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask. It's a kind of simple DD but I can elaborate on certain sectors you are interested in"

03/15/2021,stocks,I don't know how many shares you have but I've bought enough to have 100 now and sell covered calls on it. I don't know when or if it'll do anything but in the meantime I'll make a few dollars for other things. I think my average is 5.30 and I sell 7.5 calls on it. I don't care if they're called away or not. Well... unless it goes to like 20 a share or something but that the chance I take I guess.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Airlines typically don't make great long term holds. A lot of risk, not much of a moat. 

You're better off with companies that service the airline industry... Boeing, Lockheed, etc. Check out a company called Aersale that I think will do well during the recovery. They sell refurbished parts to the airline industry (mostly engines). As the recovery happens, a lot of the airlines wlil be looking to reduce costs and pay off debt. I think a company like Aersale could do really well."

I'm holding my cresco but sold off tilray already so I'm probably biased"

You could kind of say the same thing about KTOS and NIO, but I think those have a better chance than the other 2."
03/15/2021,stocks,"This is a horrible long folder. Half of it is Reddit memes or speculative stocks that you'll need to pay close attention to within the year because they will get thrashed quickly in a downturn.

Up your VTI to like 40%, keep DIS and APPL where it is if you believe they'll outperform the market over 5+ years. If you're unsure, then 60% VTI. 20% in a foreign index like VXUS. Last 20%, split between memes. Usually you want to keep speculation to 10% your port, not 50%."
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you’re young and feeling comfortable with a little risk, it’s a high-growth portfolio. That inherently means it’s also on the riskier side. I don’t see anything wrong as you have time to grow positions in more stable areas, like VTI, AAPL and DIS and you’re young. Just be aware that any blows to the NASDAQ in general will likely punish your portfolio."

03/15/2021,stocks,Not really. You have to consider that a good percentage of retailers may have already moved money into the market knowing the stimulus is coming later. It's not like everyone is sitting on a $0 balance waiting for the stimulus to drop so they can immediately invest it.

03/15/2021,stocks,Very bullish on SOFI over the next few years. Have a big position.
03/15/2021,stocks,MT has been doing well though
03/15/2021,stocks,damn. looks like Yoda drank the WSB kool-aid yall
03/15/2021,stocks,This is not that place
03/15/2021,stocks,The US government is selling all of its Bitcoin to fund stimulus checks.
03/15/2021,stocks,Correction. Not crashing...
03/15/2021,stocks,We get it. $FNKO to the moon. Are you done spamming the sub about it?
03/15/2021,stocks,Me too bro. It fucking sucks
03/15/2021,stocks,America is fking weird when they start summer time in winter. “Summer” in America lasts for nine months apparently lol
03/15/2021,stocks,"Kicking myself for not buying more leaps during the AAPL dip, they’re already up 60%. Would have been easy gains."
03/15/2021,stocks,~$14 i think. got sucked into the hype. never again
03/15/2021,stocks,If you know you should sell just fucking sell.
03/15/2021,stocks,"It's crazy though, because whenever tilray pumps so does aphria lmao"
03/15/2021,stocks,Just curious how you’re not making much at $100? Not a lot of shares?
03/15/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/15/2021,stocks,Its slowly going back up 1-2% every day
03/15/2021,stocks,At least someone got it
03/15/2021,stocks,You and I are in complete agreement. I think there's a distinct chance that we head a little lower again before the big April/Summertime meltup. I trimmed my overweight FB position this morning to free up some cash should things turn south in the near-term.
03/15/2021,stocks,It will.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Sleeping giant is gonna wake up sometime. I buy some aaple every check because I know this, even if it eats into my two loves (sony and msft)"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Sure

There were two big reasons why the NASDAQ had a correction.  The first was fear. Specifically fear of inflation.  The thing about fear is that it usually doesnt last very long, especially if the faith behind it starts to falter.  Almost every indicator is showing that inflation fears were overblown.  Its also been about 6 weeks now since the inflation fears began...its becoming old news and investors are becoming less afraid.

The second reason for the correction was the rotation of major funds from tech into value stocks.  These rotations generally play out over several weeks.  Most funds that were going to rotate, already have and the rotation is more or less complete.

Some other reasons also include the stimmy checks that are coming.  One study showed that 50% of millennials were going to invest that money in the stock market.  Millennials LOVE tech stocks and with them on discount its hard to imagine there wont be some money coming in.  Another reason is the opposite of fear....its Fear Of Missing Out.  Once theres some big green days come in, it fuels even more green as people dont want to miss out.  I have a feeling we will be seeing this in the next couple months.

Then again these are just my opinions and I am not a financial advisor so take them as what they are."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Bad advice imo. What if next red day is next week, 10% from now, and it's a -1% day? Doesn't matter who's buying or selling, you're buying a more expensive product."
03/15/2021,stocks,The Always Sunny play. Nice.
03/15/2021,stocks,I started a position just below $4 with the plan of adding to it until it reached yolo proportions. Bought some shares every day for about five weeks straight. Up to 4700 shares at CB 6.98 - it’s going to be my retire early play.
03/15/2021,stocks,Oh MY!
03/15/2021,stocks,"Pretty much every time it hits an ATH, it dives down deep to 63-64. Don’t really know why."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Just read up on it, looks like they did an offering of some sort, causing shares to dip. I wonder how low they'll go, if they'll get to $63 or lower, or stay around $67?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Maybe, I don't pay attention to that. I just know the stock goes up high, then dips to the 60s and starts to come back up. It's nothing long term for me, just free money until it stops doing that."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah I think strong juniors give you a little more juice, but those are solid picks."
03/15/2021,stocks,Yes sir free money
03/15/2021,stocks,Everyones waiting for another big dip for covid recovery stocks but there probably won't be one. Just wish I put in more in when they were stagnant while tech was booming this year. Don't we all though.
03/15/2021,stocks,I'm convinced it's basically immortal at this point
03/15/2021,stocks,"I believe in it, the potential is next level."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'd actually say that it only has really once the recent times that he's talked, but that ""once"" is a doozy.

Yeah, the major averages were completely hammered when he talked in late January. I'm not sure that I'd count that time because that time had the meme stocks/VIX mess going on."
03/15/2021,stocks,"The ""d"" is silent"
03/15/2021,stocks,"My fucking god, if you wanted to sell them you did a good job - it's way past mitnight where I live, so I will have to read it again tomorrow, but thank you very much. Definitely spiked my interest to look into it and where it's trading at least"
03/15/2021,stocks,Thanks for the confirmation bias....lol. 20 shares here and I plan to buy more on dips. They are investing heavily in their high growth high margin businesses and are phasing out low margin electronics. Their finance unit is clouding the story but it’s still a great company and a reasonable valuation.
03/15/2021,stocks,Ibuprofen?  Tylenol?  Tums?
03/15/2021,stocks,"I do have a soft spot for JKS, and it certainly is a good buy at this price, but I'm stubbornly holding out for a *great* price like what we had last Friday."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I have a bad feeling about this. But I'm always invested so here's to hoping!"
03/15/2021,stocks,The panic on WSB would be insane if for his “yolo update” he posted that he sold everything.
03/15/2021,stocks,"The thing that annoys me about it is now everyone who never invested before, bought some of GME and now they think they are an expert. I see it all over with my friends on facebook. They all think they are some stock gurus now, after literally never talking about stocks not even a year ago lol"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Lol probably, maybe I should buy some so it goes red."
03/15/2021,stocks,"My price target was $25 but didn’t expect to hit it so quickly. Pandemic relief is still on its early stages as far as international travel is concerned, so i think the companies themselves have a lot of profits awaiting them in the near future. I may join you in sticking to $30."
03/15/2021,stocks,I’m hoping that the opening into the Pacific market will help. I’d like to stay in long. I really hope it can get back to Nov/Dec levels.
03/15/2021,stocks,Would you do the same with DAL?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Thank you for that, good start to my mornin."
03/15/2021,stocks,Shakespeare
03/15/2021,stocks,Got in at 30 and feel no better
03/15/2021,stocks,"If I had a choice, I wouldn't. It's either this or he keeps cash there as a zero-interest savings fund. I've been excessively careful and done fine so far though; most of his money is in target date funds for 2030 and 2035, and I've been using <10% to make careful investments here and there. Sold my BCRX for a 20% return after a month, and I've got a small chunk in NET for the long haul. Anything I do with that account myself won't be enough to impact him horribly negatively."
03/15/2021,stocks,"My plan is to mostly use target-date funds to get safe returns with bonds and professionally managed diversity, I'm trying to just make some good calls with a small (<10%) fraction of what's there to try and help tip the scales. Nothing that would be catastrophic to lose."
03/15/2021,stocks,"That is an oddly specific and appreciated response. I'll look into those, thank you"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I mean, it's already recovered and exceeded what it was over the weekend. It just seems to happen a lot."
03/15/2021,stocks,$80 is such an arbitrary number. Doubt it will ever reach that low. It’s already good value for money
03/15/2021,stocks,"Theoretically ""priced in"" since it's somewhat expected, but even a small announcement or concrete details Will affect the market"
03/15/2021,stocks,"My dad was pretty happy when he heard me talk about tax hikes but yeah, this is the reality. 

It's happening in reconciliation if it happens at all and likely won't be happening for a while anyway I think. I was thinking that this would happen in the fall. 

Perhaps it causes a reaction, but then it became a very real possibility that you'd see tax hikes once the Georgia senate races were decided, and look at where we're at since then."
03/15/2021,stocks,The reconciliation process is made for tax adjustments.
03/15/2021,stocks,Why is tsla 700 and nio 44... its ridiculous
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think that a culmination of rising prices for LNG, greater need for electricity globally, and well put together project and management team make this stock a very interesting and poterionally lucrative long term play. With no debt moving forward and secured natural gas fields, I have a hard time imagining this play have a downside. LNG will continue to be relevant for at least the next 10 years as renewables mature. Current adminstration is ok with Natural Gas, and exporting is shown to be a profitable business. r/TellurianLNG has a lot more info on it if you want more. Hope that helps."
03/15/2021,stocks,T blows basically just a savings account with the dividend and negative or no stock price growth. Far better options
03/15/2021,stocks,This is the way
03/15/2021,stocks,Wish I knew what that ment
03/15/2021,stocks,Market but why would that affect it? Under transactions it says I bought 80 for $2671 yet under positions it says cost $2749
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm confused, how would a SPAC not help?"
03/15/2021,stocks,It was already at $276 at one point
03/15/2021,stocks,You made me recite all the days in the week.
03/15/2021,stocks,Why are you selling?
03/15/2021,stocks,Annual?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Today's not a typical Monday morning, people have hundreds of billions more to spend than they did Friday.  Where did it go?"
03/15/2021,stocks,\^ second
03/15/2021,stocks,Why can’t I see the holdings?
03/15/2021,stocks,Might take some time but yeah I'm pretty sure. Weed is awesome. I'd dca my way in.
03/15/2021,stocks,No unless you want to swing trade the hype. Put a limit buy above it's current price. Then once that executes put in a trailing stoploss so you sell close to the top before it crashes again.
03/15/2021,stocks,Look into SSPK
03/15/2021,stocks,The risk being that they dilute the shares you can buy now you mean? That's definitely a consideration. The only company I followed/invested in prior to a HK listing was BABA November 2019 and that did great by exceeding expectations. But clearly it could go either way.
03/15/2021,stocks,"yeah that's what I was thinking too. I want to sell, but I might hold. The price is already past what it was in 2019/2020 before covid, so it's  very tempting to both sell AND hold.

Hold - because we aren't fully out of covid yet, but the price is already past previous high pre-covid"
03/15/2021,stocks,I have NIO but I thought I did XPEV too because I think they bought into NIO recently since they've been struggling. I hope I didn't make a bad choice
03/15/2021,stocks,CRSR I wouldn't buy before the lockup period ends.
03/15/2021,stocks,I think there’s a clear downtrend with MWK. Their EPS trajectory is also unappealing.
03/15/2021,stocks,CRM drop was more based on future guidance and concerns over their growth potential/slack acquisition in the next year. While it did get hammered I don’t see it rebounding as well as the others because of this. It’s probably a longer term hold. I just sold all mine for a small loss just to get them off my books
03/15/2021,stocks,"got it, I'm European"
03/15/2021,stocks,ah yeah I'm not MURICAN
03/15/2021,stocks,But wasn't the premium insane?
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm just going to buy a weekly put every week until it comes crashing down again since I can afford it. If it doesn't work, I'll rethink my strategy."
03/15/2021,stocks,Oh you're almost certainly right.  No way the market doesn't overreact to that even though we all know why it will be different.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the quick reply. But Amazon was just an example, I was wondering whether I should take notice of analyst predictions in general on websites such as Money.CNN. Of course also look at other websites."
03/15/2021,stocks,"This. If it’s a strong company with solid longterm growth prospects, ignore entry points and temporary short term movements and just buy and hold. If you’re looking to move in and out of short term positions, I’ll send you a link to my crystal ball store."
03/15/2021,stocks,Which one would you suggest?
03/15/2021,stocks,its been almost 2 weeks now
03/15/2021,stocks,"Nah energy and financials are actually your worst S&P sectors today by a lot.

Doesn't really look like much is working but it looks like the Dow might be about to head back positive after dropping as low as what looks like -0.4% to -0.5%."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Should i ignore the ark EFT all together? Or put like 5-10% in them?

Anyways thanks a lot for your advice, appreciate it :)"
03/15/2021,stocks,Mine too.
03/15/2021,stocks,everyone ive talked to hates paypal and i quit using it for square
03/15/2021,stocks,Thank you! What are the differences?
03/15/2021,stocks,I thought you had to pay every quarter if you gain enough.
03/15/2021,stocks,Thanks!
03/15/2021,stocks,Apple has been 1 step forward 2 steps back for some time now. Looks like it’s found it’s resistance so it should be fine. Mostly just joking bc it’s been a pain to see it struggle so much.

03/15/2021,stocks,Mostly a joke but yes I’ll be remembering this tomorrow
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah I’m bullish on Apple. Just with my luck and how apple’s been trading for some time I have zero expectations for the stock
03/15/2021,stocks,What a rollercoaster
03/15/2021,stocks,Happy to see i am not only one under performing the market today. I am up 0.28% which sucks compared to the market lol
03/15/2021,stocks,Ding ding!
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah. Seemed like it was higher then the rest.
03/15/2021,stocks,Same. I would think 45-50 is a better price for it.
03/15/2021,stocks,"same, CCL and NCLH for me. Sucks I run out of cash during the dips"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Wow it really dropped below $8. Do you think it'll find it's way back to $50-$70 now that COVID is loosening regulations, and summer is coming up?"
03/15/2021,stocks,Hahaha yesssir
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes, I rebalanced some of my big tech last year to these riskiest growth stocks because they might be least impacted for his agenda. His policies do encourage people to buy the riskiest assets as he propose tax on big companies while stimulus for small business, that’s why people are gambling on penny stocks turnaround."
03/15/2021,stocks,Taking a lot of damage (going down quickly). It’s a MMORPG term haha
03/15/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I accept that risk. I won’t sell if it looks like I won’t profit in the short-term. 

What would you recommend for short term gains?"
03/15/2021,stocks,How would you make it fun
03/15/2021,stocks,"Ayy! How do you like living there? I’d want to visit to see the landscape, go whale watching, see the northern lights, etc. It looks like a beautiful country!"
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah I’ve got like 2 grand in savings. That’s a few months of expenses for me and I feel very stable in my current job
03/15/2021,stocks,How much is the management fee for betz?
03/15/2021,stocks,Bruh. So sorry. I’ll pour one out for you.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Well, I don't want to be. I only have a small position because I have a small account, so only 5 shares. I'm just not sure the best way to take profits without it doubling up..."
03/15/2021,stocks,but its been 2 whole days since BTC was that low! massive crash!
03/15/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/15/2021,stocks,"I got it at 118, I was considering target price 119 but decided to be greedy. When it starts climbing, it will be glorious."
03/15/2021,stocks,14.81 I'm almost there!
03/15/2021,stocks,Suddenly I can't read
03/15/2021,stocks,Yup their trajectories are pretty much the same. I’m sure by 4/20 it’ll be closer. I’m just happy it’s going up again. My dumbass bought both at ath.
03/15/2021,stocks,If it hits $100 I will make $542 Australian. Which would be nice but I mean the chances of this fucker hitting 100 is quite low right now and it's only 500.
03/15/2021,stocks,Paper hands over here
03/15/2021,stocks,Me too
03/15/2021,stocks,"That's why I said ""the bulk"" of your buying. Notice that I didn't say *all* your buying. You absolutely should be nibbling at the market, all the time. But considering how many dips we see on the way up, you're better off doing your bulk purchases on big red days."
03/15/2021,stocks,Holy shit. That’s great. Hope it works out for you. It was my first “risky” buy and I only did $15 shares. It immediately shot down and I didn’t add in. I should have as I actually believe in the product/company. Oh well. Happy to have some skin in the game with my 15 shares.
03/15/2021,stocks,I'll keep that in mind thank you.
03/15/2021,stocks,Airline stocks and free money should never be used in the same sentence.
03/15/2021,stocks,"It's like a movie monster. People shoot it,.it stumbles and then gets back up and keeps advancing."
03/15/2021,stocks,"No problemo, I'll link you some articles on Sony as I'm in no way an analyst
Links are on the DD now"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah, no problem giving you some confirmation bias, at least for me it was a little bit of a wake up call going from 120-100 and not being able to do anything (due to not having enough capital as my business tends to be really successful in the summer)"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Well I hope you get it, I've never understood why it trades at the price it does and have avoided it because of that. But on paper its tempting."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Nah, we're good. We're above the support line and, despite repeated attempts, have not dropped below it.  


My money's on the bulls."
03/15/2021,stocks,As opposed to huge green days throughout the week? I think I'd be more disconcerted about those.
03/15/2021,stocks,My friend and girlfriend both work in financial services. The amount of calls they get from clients who are self-proclaimed experts all of a sudden is astounding.
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah it’s pretty embarrassing. I keep thinking like ok this DD is insane no way. Than it moons 50 percent one day. Then another 50 percent. Something is definitely going on with it so I guess I see the hype. I just can’t imagine Wall Street letting it happen honestly.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Just my opinion, but I think prob has a limited customer base, and it will go the way all the at home exercise fads have gone."
03/15/2021,stocks,All airlines should be sold if you are ahead. Depending on oil prices they are either going to go up or crash.
03/15/2021,stocks,"$80 is not arbitrary. It gives me the preferred % upside I'm looking for in the stock. And if you think JD won't dip any lower during this dual inflationary scare/Chinese tech selloff, then you're far more bullish than the majority of the market right now. Go ahead and look at JD's MACD lines, and tell me this stock won't see lower prices in the near future. JD's chart is a nightmare right now."
03/15/2021,stocks,"It’s the same bullshit depending on who is in charge of office. Reality is, it will just never go through all of the stages something would need to get passed and the deadline gets pushed back and back and they sit on it and then BAM Republican president vetos"
03/15/2021,stocks,It went public via a SPAC that saw the share price go through the floor at the time of the merger. SBE hurt to hold.
03/15/2021,stocks,I sold some of my 400% gains to buy dips.
03/15/2021,stocks,">Today's not a typical Monday morning, people have hundreds of billions more to spend than they did Friday. Where did it go?

Vegas, baby"
03/15/2021,stocks,"You need to relax nobody can predict the market. If it ends up being a red day then so be, but nobody can read these hedge funds and institutions minds. Every Monday morning people have more liquidity available, but if we could time the market we’d be billionaires buddy."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Judging by the phase-outs on stimmy, probably to pay rent/mortgage and feed their family. Its not like 100% of the stimulus is gonna be injected into the market. Essentials and toys like iPhones first, man."
03/15/2021,stocks,"That's a valid concern, though I do wonder how much the stock is actually going to decline, considering how underpriced it currently is. Will it hit $32 again? Sub-$30? I think $34/$35 will ultimately serve as as the support line, so picking up shares here is hardly that risky, IMO."
03/15/2021,stocks,When does CRSR lockup end?
03/15/2021,stocks,This is a terrible strategy 😂
03/15/2021,stocks,"Exactly. Its not so much ""OMG BAD CPI REPORT, PANIC"". Its more ""Omg bad CPI report, other people will panic, let's sell before them""."
03/15/2021,stocks,"this is just my opinion and not intended as advice but HUT.TO and HIVE.V are two big ones. there is also BITF.V, DIGI.V, and DMGI.CN. 

Do your own DD of course and only put in what you are willing to lose."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Strange, then I'm not sure.  You might want to reach out to your brokerage and ask them."
03/15/2021,stocks,"It depends on the risk you want to take. ARK* funds are extremely speculative and do well when the market is running hot. The problem is, as we just saw over the last 4 weeks, any slight downturn is detrimental to them and all speculative stock.

If you're willing to take the risk of loss, bearing in mind ARKK has already run up north of 100% within the last year, then go for it. The problem is that the party will eventually come a stop and when it does, I'd bet good money ARK funds go the way of all the prior FotM actively managed ETFs and dies. If you think you can get out before that happens, I say pull the trigger.

If you want set-and-forget investing, I say shoot for market-wide indexes. Maybe keep your DIS and APPL if you think they'll outperform the market in the long-run. For those indexes you'll never beat the market, but you'll never out-lose the market either. No need to manage or rebalance, just fucking ignore it until you're much older."
03/15/2021,stocks,"QQQM is the top 100 companies in the NASDAQ by market cap. So your Apples, Microsofts, etc.

QQQJ is the “Next Gen 100” so the 101st-200th biggest companies. Still large companies but not quite as large so in theory there’s potential for them to grow more."
03/15/2021,stocks,Oh we got a rule follower here.
03/15/2021,stocks,"You can avoid penalties for underpayment of estimated tax by simply paying 100% of last year's amount by the time you have to actually file your return. 

So, if you paid 30k in Federal taxes last year, you just need to have at least 30k sent to the IRS before tax season, even if you sold a massive amount of stock for like a 500k gain or something.

During tax season, you pay the rest you owe when you file your return. 

For state, you need to look up your state's own rules.

However, make sure you still have enough to pay lol. People have realized a significant amount of gains before, and then lost most of it later in the year without actually realizing the loss till next year ... 

Those people are officially screwed."

Do you actually realize enough gains? I doubt it."

03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm honestly still trying to learn how to make those decisions.  CCL was on a year to year decline for the past several years before covid, I'm not actually sure if it'll come back stronger than it was pre-covid somehow anytime soon.

And yet, it keeps continuously gaining, so what the hell do I know XD.  That's about the extent of my DD on them, it's possible the pent up desire for social gatherings would help propel the price, but they themselves admitted they sold some boats off from the pandemic and it will take awhile to get their pre-covid numbers back.

I sort of bought into it because I assumed most things hit hardest by covid would rebound, unfortunately I got my money back into investing a little too late to get other things I wanted to get like airline stocks."
03/15/2021,stocks,lololol “tanking” in this context does not come from MMORPGs
03/15/2021,stocks,I know what it means.  -1.6% is far from tanking.  Just another day in the stock market.
03/15/2021,stocks,Volatility
03/15/2021,stocks,It’s pretty good! The Northern Lights have been unusually bright lately
03/15/2021,stocks,its actually kinda high at 0.75%. Not sure why its so high... but so far its been worth it.
03/15/2021,stocks,Yuuup. Heavily undervalued.
03/15/2021,stocks,Same. 14.65! I think we get to $20 though.

03/15/2021,stocks,"If you feel $84 doesn’t give you sufficient upside, but $80 does then you are going after some very thin value.

If you feel $84 is good price but you’re waiting for it to fall to $80 because you want in at a better price, then you’re just looking to time the market which in my experience doesn’t work. If it’s $100 next year, then you’ve missed out on a $16 per share gain if it never hits $80."
03/15/2021,stocks,All of that is the market.  Hell it literally gets directly injected into banks and bank stocks are down too.  There is *nowhere* for 2 trillion dollars to go that isn't the market.

03/15/2021,stocks,I made 1400 on GME. Was fun. Made a couple hundred on Bitcoin last few days. Was fun. This 90 bucks in BB was just getting caught up in meme stocks without thinking.
03/15/2021,stocks,"> so the bulk should be bought immediately

Tell that to everyone who bought right before the recent correction. The better plan is to watch the market and learn its movements and understand when we're getting closer to a potential downside scenario. Recognizing the toppish behavior a month or so ago, I went heavy cash right before the correction and moved a ton of money into the market during that recent Friday lowpoint. Thanks to my patience and understanding, I'm already now up 10-20% on a bunch of new positions.

You can't predict that market, but you can learn what to look for in terms of suggestive patterns. And you can be patient and wait for better entry points rather than FOMOing in on some random date and praying to the gods of green."
03/15/2021,stocks,You bears say this all the time without any specific reasons why.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Exactly. Women with disposable income set the trends, so listen to them!

But those trends change on a whim."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Or, my portfolio is already sitting pretty and I have no need to jump into a stock until the kind of big upside I prefer becomes available. No need to Fomo into something when I'm already doing great. I'd rather just be patient and see if I can get an even better deal in the future. In my experience, that has paid off handsomely, time and time again."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Right but you are looking for all that money to be pumped into stocks immediately. Not gonna happen. $700 iPhones don't equate to APPL going up. What makes APPL go up is more people buying the stock than selling it.

Economy =/= market. They have correlation, but not directly as evidenced by the massive bull run we've had and 2020."
03/15/2021,stocks,"No problem! Yeah they were both introduced in October of last year.

For more past performance of QQQM, you can look at the chart of QQQ. It’s the same ETF but has been established longer. M is a new one they released with a lower expense ratio. So i recommend M over regular QQQ it you plan to buy and hold long term. If you’re more of a trader, regular QQQ could be the way to go since its the more established fund and has higher trade volumes (easier to buy/sell quickly)."
03/15/2021,stocks,"If this was last year, then look into having to pay it this year. Like the other guy said, you should be fine paying 100% of last year taxes. The other option is 90% total taxes due. If that 200k made was this year, you should be fine. IRS won't expect a sudden 200k jump.

I'm a CPA, but not a Tax CPA. If you're making this money YoY, then spend the $350 and get a professional. Shit, most will do free consultations. Shop around and find one you like."
03/15/2021,stocks,What? Lol. I posted my DD once and didn't spam it everywhere. How are the things correlated?
03/15/2021,stocks,But you did sell all mid February too? And have you sold other times that turned out to be a mistake? Exception to the rule imo.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm a bull on steroids lol just worried, market feels off"
03/15/2021,stocks,"The bull run corresponded with previous stimulus money getting pumped into the market. 

Why are people selling?"
03/15/2021,stocks,Thanks! I will try to buy both
03/15/2021,stocks,"I always sell something when we're seeing toppish behavior. To be clear, the saying is buy low, sell high. It's not the other way around, my friend. I sold some more on the way down — pure profit, the whole way — recognizing the depths we were likely to reach. 

And it's never a mistake to sell. Cash is strength. You always want a cash position in your portfolio to pounce on new opportunities. And the market will never stop providing you with these opportunities. The key is top be ready and patient. Learn how to read charts and remain patient and you will make more money thanks to better entry points."
03/15/2021,stocks,More off than last year?
03/15/2021,stocks,"3 things:

1. It did not.

2. History =/= future

3. All the major indeces are up. People are buying, not selling."
03/15/2021,stocks,Best of luck!
03/15/2021,stocks,">	To be clear, the saying is buy low, sell high.

Yes it is! Not sell high, buy higher, as many people are probably going to do with your ""advice"". 

The stock market is anatomically designed to go up in the long run. Selling and buying for timing is trading, not investing."
03/15/2021,stocks,Well yeah lol we're a hell of a lot higher
03/15/2021,stocks,so what didnt happen?  we didnt have a bull run or we didnt have previous stimulus money?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Well, enjoy buying high and selling low, my friend. Instead of that, you could learn to read stock charts, remain patient, not get all FOMO, and recognize that optimal entry points may appear in the future, so that you can maximize your money. That's how the professionals play this game, rather than blundering into the market on any random day like a novice."

Might want to set that buy order a \*little\* higher than $179, though...even though with the short interest on GME way down now and it not being a short-squeeze anymore, there are other things to consider:

1. Most retail brokerages still have restrictions on GME. They let you buy and sell it long now, but if you try to short sell it, you get a message that says 'shares on this security are too difficult to borrow currently'...and won't allow the trade.
2. People can buy puts on GME, if they really want to...but with IV super-duper-pooper high on GME right now, no-one in their right mind would do so (clearly last week I was not in my right mind)...
3. This means the only way the stock can go down is if retail or institutions sell it long, or institutions short it...

So...it will probably rebound short-term.

PS: Its already rebounded a little..."

03/15/2021,stocks,You missed me at 4.29 today sorry bro
03/15/2021,stocks,"Or could be GME people selling and joining the AMC, that’s what I am guessing, someplace to put their money for a bit. If GME follows the last pump and dump it had should be back around the 50 range in 7-10 days. Then they will load up again and see how many more times they squeeze people.

Edit: if I am right about the sell off going on right now on GME could you remove your downvote? I can understand if I said something like “ape couldn’t find sell button” but I am not talking crap, just pointed out the obvious because if you weren’t here for the last one, well sometimes history repeats itself."
03/15/2021,stocks,Just converted my sub $2 warrants the other day!
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but diamond hands emojis though.  


I'm just bitter I sold at $140 after getting in too high & being too greedy. I could have gotten back to break-even."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I heard of regular people dumping $2k into GME with zero stock experience. They have no idea what an option is, let alone covered calls."
03/15/2021,stocks,It was fun and games when the stock was bouncing up and down. When it's falling for half the day though.... Feels like it's over.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm happy about it when I actually have money to spend and it dips low enough for me to average down... but that's not the case anymore, so I'm just sitting and waiting lol"
03/15/2021,stocks,One is CDN on TSX and one is USD on NASDAQ
03/15/2021,stocks,apha is a canadian company so the 27 is cdn $ on TSX
03/15/2021,stocks,"I don’t think past movement is in any way indicative of future movement with GME, whatsoever."
03/15/2021,stocks,I think it will hit at least $350 by eow.
03/15/2021,stocks,1 covered call 17 SEP strike 65. $560 for your trouble. Keep an eye on it and buy it back closer to expiration if you want to keep it or if it blows up. This is not a bad problem to have (unless you needed the 5k for something else).
03/15/2021,stocks,"Agreed, lots of good news rolling in of late. Watching closely for Thursday's dividend update."
03/15/2021,stocks,Me and my 4.02 Nokia shares just got invited to the shareholders meeting in Finland. You coming?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Take this with a grain of salt, I'm new to stocks/investing. I have no idea if GME is gonna go up, down, or sideways.

That said, I think lots of people will have limit sells at the previous spikes like like $325-350 to try to profit before it inevitably crashes again so I think it will have a hard time going above $350. I think there's also probably a bunch of bag holders from last time looking to just break even at ~300."
03/15/2021,stocks,Just read another long post is GME and they are expecting 2mil a share
03/15/2021,stocks,"The first ""squeeze"" could have gone up to thousands. The shorters have doubled down since then. Its inconceivable that 10k plus is ridiculous."
03/15/2021,stocks,"$10,000+ seems outlandish and I certainly don’t think it’s likely. However, when it comes to GME, I wouldn’t rule anything out at this point, it’s already blown past my expectations three times."
03/15/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/15/2021,stocks,"I assume you mean after hours. We're in the after hours now, so if you want to buy after hours, pout the orders in now.

When you place an order, you'll enter a limit price and the order will or won't be filled below that limit. The price the market opens at doesn't affect you."
03/15/2021,stocks,">This is the hedgies trying to get people to sell.

Huh?

What?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think this it is about options expiring, although they've said this about a dozen different dates at this point. Think the idea is if some calls end in the money, then people will buy those calls, increasing the stock price to the next call options, up and up. Of course this has the issue of people flipping the in-the-money calls, which I would think would bring the price back down.

Only other thing I could think of is earnings, but that appears to be on the 23rd."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Quadruple witching day, 
Options, 
Ryan Cohen hinting at becoming CEO (not fixed to 19th though), 
Earnings on 23rd (calling shares back after?splitting them?), 
New DTCC rule might kick in on 19th too. 

All fun and games 🥤🍿

Edit: punctuation"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Been looking good, up 23% today."
03/15/2021,stocks,I can’t. You’ll be v happy with that play in 5 years when the share price is up 50% and you’ve reinvested your dividends.
03/15/2021,stocks,SQ
03/15/2021,stocks,"Use the weekends as your gauging tool, I would go Mondays myself. Usually Fridays leave people in suspense and the behaviour over the weekend can help visualize what will happen Monday. Not financial advice."
03/15/2021,stocks,I took today off.  Monday's suck at work.  All the ppl that don't work periodically on the weekends trying to play catch up.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Congrats. I hope you have AH trading and sold, that's a pretty obvious profit taking situation."
03/15/2021,stocks,I got caught at the top last time and bag held a few shares at $12. Be careful.
03/15/2021,stocks,Bro that's kinda cringe but damn if that dont slap
03/15/2021,stocks,Ron Johnson is a corrupt asshole with a lot of money.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Please tell me what's coming since you know.

Also I said something other than those things in the past month and didn't get banned."
03/15/2021,stocks,Chill bruh no need to wish other retailers harm
03/15/2021,stocks,You'll either triple your money or lose it all. Good luck!
03/15/2021,stocks,Certainly an inverse WSB move
03/15/2021,stocks,"The market cap is too low for AMC, I’d say go all the way to 30s"
03/15/2021,stocks,"^ This is a basic bitch shill account

No effort"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah I figured it would bounce up and wanted to make quick buck on the volatility. But I didn't sell when it got back to $260 and it's all the way down since then.

Shouldn't have gotten greedy...."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I thought the drop around 11am was it >.<

Greed is the worst enemy."
03/15/2021,stocks,Might go all in at $40 for round three and hope third time’s the charm if the pattern continues.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Week before that a crash followed by a recovery to pre-liftoff  level followed by a weekend followed by a slow bleed on monday.

It's uncanny."
03/15/2021,stocks,I think 193 was optimal cup handle but we’ll see
03/15/2021,stocks,"Dont think that make people will sell if it bleeds. Been super volatile for months, why would everyone collectively sell tomorrow. Plus we got stimmys coming in, people will probably buy more"
03/15/2021,stocks,"It’s a partnership with Amazon , google and Microsoft.

https://www.benzinga.com/node/20170550"
03/15/2021,stocks,I strongly believe it will hit $20 EOW.  Shit....  It could have easily hit today.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah I got in at an average of $12 due to the fomoing with gme etc, but realistically it could be a good hold until after a year or more of covid recovery. So many movies just waiting to be released, it's going to be a flood. My only regret was not being able to get more from 5-7. Ah well, next time!"
03/15/2021,stocks,"When I heard that GME was shorted again, I was like, there’s no way these hedge funds are doing that without someone figuring out how to profit off of this. 

That’s why I decided to watch from the sidelines this time. I think /WSB and /GME think that they are in control right now, but I feel like it is the institutional investors that are getting the most out of this this time."
03/15/2021,stocks,"And that’s what I was thinking. The price will jump up quickly and then hit at wall around $350. So my guess is they short the hell out of it at $350 or something, then profit off of the skyrocketing price, and then sell off massively to prevent it from reaching their shorts."
03/15/2021,stocks,"> They never mention at what price the shorts are. Like if most of the shorts are at $300 why would the HF cares if it gets pumped out to 250?

Because it's probably difficult to cover. I wouldn't be suprised if the jump from $180-ish to $250+ were from shorts covering.

The stock is insanely illiquid for its price tag. Had multiple sell orders rejected by the stock exchange when I tried to sell at around $250 a few days ago (didn't sell at $340 but profit is profit).

Even if it does go to the moon, ""apes"" will have trouble locking in profit."
03/15/2021,stocks,"It got halted 7 times in that span. Once or twice on the way back up

03/15/2021,stocks,"On the 10th. It was shooting up super fast. When it resumed was when it had dropped like a rock. I was watching at the time because, as usual, I bought right before the drop."
03/15/2021,stocks,It’s already rebounded hard from that dip
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah it already shot back up haha. I was expecting at least one more circuit break. Oh well. Got partially back in at 245.
03/15/2021,stocks,I think it’s gonna be tough to try and repeat what just happened again (again). People will see the pattern at that point I would think.
03/15/2021,stocks,perhaps yeah. the reopening alone doesn't seem enough to bump but at this point who knows
03/15/2021,stocks,There's plenty of fish in the sea. Follow the meme's and pick up the crumbs.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Can confirm am regular dude, dumped 20k into gme. This was quite the crash course on not being greedy."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I been trying to figure out what earnings would have to look like next week for it not to crash and how likely that is.  It seems like for it to hold or go up they would need a double line beat with good guidance.

However with console shortages that seems like it’s going to be hard, bundles means better margins and those margins should sustain as long as consoles are low in supply, but that is not great for total sales or revenue.

If they anticipate a big increase in supply that should be good for sales guidance but not great for profit guidance, if there isn’t an anticipated increase it puts a cap on revenues.

Have zero money in it on either side just seems like an interesting question."
03/15/2021,stocks,"That's for sure, I will be glad when the ride ends. Did not plan to buy a stock that has to be watched so much. I am up about 100% though."
03/15/2021,stocks,Why
03/15/2021,stocks,Haha my 46 shares and 3 Jan 21 2022 5.5cs will meet you there!
03/15/2021,stocks,"This is 100% where I am. I FOMO'ed into GME and wanted to jump out at 350. Of course it hit 348 and nose dived and was a major punch in the gut. 

Now I'm aiming lower to try and break even at the very least and I have no doubt other people who saw that dive last week will be thinking the same.

Edit: You WSB lurkers can downvote this all you want, that doesn't stop it from being true."
03/15/2021,stocks,WSB might not like it but this is probably the most reasonable comment about GME I've read so far
03/15/2021,stocks,Im shocked its even at this level... i can't believe the amount of money some of these people are just throwing around without a care in the world
03/15/2021,stocks,"You're saying this as if everyone from round one hasn't wisened up to the volatility of this stock. 

I think this can hit $800 to a shave over $1K with stimulus money and more chatter."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I do think this is a likely scenario... lots of selling around the $350 mark (or just under, where it collapsed last week). I suspect many of these are folks who plan to sell to recoup inital/take profit, and then knowing the volatility, jump back in at a lower price point. I suspect this could take the wind out of the sails of the next mini-squeeze, but hopefully won't hurt the longer-term upward trajectory. That said, I just had a crayon for breakfast, so what do I know.... ???

Edit - surprised at the amount of downvoting on this, I'm merely saying the above scenario is a likely one for some folks."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Pretending this could actually happen for a minute, wouldn't that have like a catastrophic impact on the economy?"
03/15/2021,stocks,True
03/15/2021,stocks,So 10k plus is ridiculous?

03/15/2021,stocks,Appreciate the reply! Placing order now
03/15/2021,stocks,See those big red dicks? That’s not individual investors panicking. That’s HF trying to turn diamonds into paper but thank god Newton said no.
03/15/2021,stocks,Thanks dude
03/15/2021,stocks,What is the potential new DTCC rule you speak of? Sorry if this is a noob question.
03/15/2021,stocks,"yup, I don't plan on holding my position long, so I'm just trying to get a feel for when I should skeedaddle."
03/15/2021,stocks,Stuck between doing that with COST vs AAPL
03/15/2021,stocks,Its closer to it's 52 week high and more volatile. I want something safe and comfy. Tech makes me nervous
03/15/2021,stocks,"I profited on my $10 calls expiring this friday, sold them on the run up to $9 I'm gonna keep my measly 200 shares for awhile, I dont see them going down much lower than $6 short term, long term I'm bullish after seeing what it is that they're doing and the Lockheed Martin deal is definitely a great selling point"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Totally understand, fortunately I’m not up that high with the shares and this could be a good push if it gets some notice, seems once weekly it really has some decent push. Don’t listen to me though I’m not a professional either I’m just here to try and make some money with my peoples 😂"
03/15/2021,stocks,A lesson in taking profits is coming.
03/15/2021,stocks,"It sounds like he's directing it at gamblers, not retailers"
03/15/2021,stocks,Retail investors learn along the way. WSB YOLO people that downvote you to oblivion for anything other than HODL deserve the hard lesson they are getting.
03/15/2021,stocks,Except that’s what the GME cult does to anyone not preaching the GME gospel
03/15/2021,stocks,"What do you mean? I’m not trying to spread FUD, I was just told by others that their stock has been diluted to gain money to pay off debt"
03/15/2021,stocks,They say we are supposed to learn our lesson. I have a bunch of OTM NIO calls right now. Just moved my gambling addiction to another stock. 🤷🏻‍♂️
03/15/2021,stocks,There’s still time to get out. I’m counting on premarket being on the upswing tomorrow as I bought my one share today.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah it messes with you. Truth is, we all could have bought in big when it was sitting at $48 for 3 weeks. But who believed in it ever rebounding other than the people bag holding at $300+? Anything over $100 gets real risky, real fast. The gains are made when you buy so low that it seems like the ride is over."
03/15/2021,stocks,Because last time it fought back to still be positive on the day.  I don't blame you.
03/15/2021,stocks,"No way it hit 40 again, just on the strong belief that a THIRD round is a possibilty alone. People aren't gonna want to miss a potential +100% day.(and 500% week)

&#x200B;

Probably his a TON of buying order at aroud 60-80 already."
03/15/2021,stocks,Ya I think that’s what most people are thinking
03/15/2021,stocks,If there is a third time.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Agreed. It looks like it steadied in AH so, we might see a regular day tomorrow, and by that I mean a swing of 30% in either direction lmao."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm on the sidelines now too, but if/when it dips much lower I'll probably buy back in. Nothing I have seen leads me to believe these shenanigans will stop soon, so why not profit if I can. Not to the Moon, I've learned my lesson, but there's profit to be had."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I bet there’s a lot that think retail is in control, but most have realized (or probably should have) that hedge funds are running the show at this point. Everybody else is just hanging on and hoping to profit."
03/15/2021,stocks,It is such a reief to read logical comments about GME that aren't just downvoted into hell. WSB is becoming hard to be a part of.
03/15/2021,stocks,"> and then sell off massively to prevent it from reaching their shorts.

And make loads.

Rinse and repeat until retail can't buy in anymore, the price bottoms out then exit the shorts to offset the bagholding."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I thought people would have saw the pattern after the peak then major dip last week, but then more people bought in. I am thinking they will be able to repeat it a few more times (there are a bunch of people that “bought in” not talking about stock) but the peak will get smaller and smaller."
03/15/2021,stocks,Do you have more than 100 shares? Sell 1 covered call at 310 for $2k. Not bad for 30 seconds of work.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Prices are so utterly divorced from reality already though, it feels like it could easily go either way."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Same reason, that weird gut feeling. There is no reasonable way to estimate what it is going to do that I can find. Been in less than a month and already feels like forever. I am too old for this..."
03/15/2021,stocks,Dive was engineered but go ahead and pull out at 350. Be comfortable with the possibility of leaving a lot of money on the table. $600+ per share easily
03/15/2021,stocks,It's an aggressive fund(s) driving this. Retail can't pay these prices at a volume or speed high enough to match what we're seeing. Stock manipulation in the open with a scapegoat: retail.
03/15/2021,stocks,"The downvoting is probably for the ""crayon for breakfast"" thing. You're in Stocks here, not WSB."
03/15/2021,stocks,It would crash the whole economy

Answer is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lj1wqv/a_comprehensive_compilation_of_all_due_diligence/gqj6bk1"
03/15/2021,stocks,Been wishing I had gotten in instead on that instead of GME. Still have pretty high hopes though.
03/15/2021,stocks,Do both 50-50. Ez way to beat the market imo
03/15/2021,stocks,You have a 10% upside possible. It's down right now only because of bond yields. The company itself was doing gangbusters before the dip. $COST has an 8% upside pre-dip and it's going DOWN while other tech stocks are going up. And it's more expensive.
03/15/2021,stocks,They didn't learn it the first time...
03/15/2021,stocks,"We all know they were in debt and will be in debt for a while. But that was not the news, also not why the stock is up. The stock price is based on expectation of movie industry recovery later this year, and AMC will be the top player. I don’t think the market cap is high if the whole movie market recovers from here. (5B is not even higher than a lot of startup IPOs this year)"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah I'm debating getting out today or tomorrow. My instincts are the same as yours, that they'll be an upswing in the morning. But I can't trade until an hour before market open so I'm kinda worried it might crash before I can get to it."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah you're totally right. I got greedy thinking I could make a few quick bucks off a bounce. I should've closed it out when things started going south but I didn't, so now I'm bagholding.

Trying to decide whether to just suck it up and sell now... At least I'd still be even for the day. If it crashes again tomorrow pre-market... :S"
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah nobody really knows. I thought it was done and dusted after the first time.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I don't think you should.

It's not jumping up and down right now. It's creeping it's way down.

Which is bad for a hype stock. It's boring and boring is bad.

I think that's what made it burst last time. You know, the other monday where the stock slowly deflated during the whole day."
03/15/2021,stocks,Fair point and agree - if it does do the same thing again the peak will certainly be smaller as newer investors who are left bag holding on this run take profit and folks who see the pattern / ride the whales/funds will also exit earlier. It’s a shame because i do actually believe in Ryan Cohen and think there’s an opportunity long term but the stock just keeps getting manipulated. I’ve made money off both runs and I’ll buy back in again when it drops to its lows and plateaus and wait it out  to see what happens.
03/15/2021,stocks,Just shows how broken the system is if that’s truly the case. I still love my tendies
03/15/2021,stocks,It’s not easy though is it. In fact it was sheer luck that it went back up in the first place
03/15/2021,stocks,"First dive was engineered, sure. But what about the second dive from 350 to 85?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Why wouldn't we assume there are more cases of market engineering coming though? Genuine question, that's not me pretending to know what GME will do."
03/15/2021,stocks,Perhaps such an economy should be crashed
03/15/2021,stocks,"I feel like that can't be true. It would be insane to hit that price point, but it's not like that would be a rivaling the gdp kinda number.

But again, I don't truly understand shit about what's going on"
03/15/2021,stocks,"What do you mean by ""doing gangbusters"""
03/15/2021,stocks,"Wild, I didn’t realize it was 5B lol, that’s insanely low"
03/15/2021,stocks,"No I mean much lower like down to the $50-70 level. I'm staying far away from this current whatever-the-hell-is-going-on.

I am very familiar with that Monday, I almost sold on Friday approximately at cost but decided to 💎🙌🏾 and ended up selling at the end of the day at like a 40% loss. I hate GME, but I hate myself more lol."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I also will buy back in when it hits the 25-40 range, I actually like GameStop and would love to invest in its future, but it’s hard to pass up the profits while these whales are in control of the stock."
03/15/2021,stocks,The market doesn’t normally sell that many shares that quickly. I agree with the sentiment that 350 is even tougher to break through now though
03/15/2021,stocks,"In a vacuum, sure I like the idea of a Fight Club style destruction of banks and whatnot.

As a dude that lives in said economy, no thank you. I like having a job, house, life and things generally work for me. If everything collapsed, the odds of whatever comes next being decidedly worse, whether that be a foreign govt taking over or our own govt taking drastic measures, seems high to me.

But I mean whatever, I have never invested in gme and never will. I'm glad there are people out there getting rich off this shit and I enjoy watching from the sidelines. If a total economic collapse is the end result there's nothing I could have done about it anyways."
03/15/2021,stocks,It was going up.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Right? Lol It also explains why it could be up so much in a day, cause small cap is more volatile with large cash infused."
03/15/2021,stocks,"It burned me too.

I was still up that day but at the end of it I had decided to leave on account on how boring the day was, how WSB had reached peak ape and the isthesqueezesquoze website had added a PSA on how ""This isn't a game"".

Problem is it dropped $100 in premarket and I was straight in the red.

Lesson is lock in profit along the way."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Not the whole economy bit the system that allows for something like this essentially just shines a light on how little substance there is, how much of a game it is, and how few players previously had access. I'm hoping this is one part of a societal shakeup / reform / rethink. Now that we can communicate and organize the old systems are proving to not his be archaic but almost sinister."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm gonna put all my cards on the table and say that I'm personally a libertarian socialist.

I definitely understand your perspective and where you're coming from. 2008 hurt a lot of people. At the same time I can't say a part of me is not excited to see another 2008 which might be capable of leading to some real, lasting, change. ""Never waste a good crisis"" they say, yet we wasted the 2008 crisis. Maybe a 2021 or 2022 crisis wouldn't be wasted now that there's a stronger progressive/ecological movement around the globe?

Sadly, real change only seems to happen after the system has already broken, and with the extreme wealth inequality and economic instability around the world today I think it's about time for some change."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Well here's the thing about 2008. If you were highly liquid at the time, and you dumped all your money into the market after it crashed, you got short listed to a new level of wealth. If you weren't, you were hurting and struggled to recover.

I love the concept of radical change, honestly, I just don't trust it to head in a positive direction for the majority of people."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I guess whether or not an economic crash would result in good or bad change depends on the current political climate, and on this point let's remember that any economic crisis affects the whole world, not just America.

I think the biggest metric for whether or not a crisis will be good or bad depends on the ideology and zeitgeist of the societies around the world. If the world is largely tilting towards right-wing fascism, then any resulting reform would take that shape. If the world is turning towards socialism, reform would come from a leftist perspective. Or, as in 2008, if the majority of the world is liberal then the resulting society will become liberal (or in 2008's case, stay liberal.)

So where are we now? There certainly has been a growing right-wing extremism throughout most of the liberal capitalist countries around the world. Look at the Republican party in America, Bolsonaro in Brazil, Bojo and Nigel Farage in the UK, growing right-wing extremism in Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Poland and Turkey. All of these certainly indicate that reform would be reactionary.

I certainly don't think that liberalism would fare well if there was another economic crash. While it is possible that modern liberalism could survive, I think it would require a huge PR-spin as liberalism seems to be ineffective at internalising the externalities it has created, and people are noticing this. Its why there's growing radicalism on both political sides.

So how could labour/socialism fare? Well, I think we're currently seeing the rise of leftism throughout much of Europe as many in Western and central Europe are becoming disillusioned with right-wing reactionary politics that has dominated much of European politics since 2014. The largest indicator of this, I'd argue, is the rapidly growing Green Party in Germany while the AfD is loosing support with the German population, the failure of Le Pen in France, the disaster that has been Brexit and Nigel Farage being made politically irrelevant.

But let's not only focus on Europe. We've seen massive leftist/populist activism in the South-American and Asian world, even having the largest general strike in history happen in India not too long ago, the massive strikes in Chile against their neo-liberal government, the massive protests against climate change throughout Asia, the victory of the MAS party in Bolivia and the imprisonment of Jaenine Áñez. We've also seen growing populism in America with the majority popular BLM movement, the growing progressive wing in the Democratic party, and the loss for Donald Trump.

I think currently, except for Eastern Europe, Turkey and Russia, most of the Liberal democracies around the globe are starting to turn away from reactionary right-wing extremism and towards Labour politics. Would the left or the right win if there was a call for reform today? I don't know, I think it's up in the air. But I do think the left has a real shot at creating lasting reform if an economic crisis should happen within the next decade/half-decade"
2021-03-15 12:17:23,stocks,"In which scenario Tech won’t keep growing? Hello everyone,

currently I am in the process of creating a good long-term ETF portfolio.

When I‘m searching for the perfect „match“, I can’t unsee that the TECH ETFs have been performing extremely well in the past 10+ years. Examples: S&P 500 Technology Sector, MSCI World Information Technology.

And when I speak to other people about putting my money there, everybody says „Ooh, you are betting only on technology, be careful.“

Maybe it‘s a difficult question to answer, but what is wrong with „betting“ on technology only? In which scenario tech is going to stop growing? Is this even possible?

Thanks."
03/15/2021,stocks,"It's good that you're inviting counter arguments.

I agree, tech by and large is going to do well.

But given the long horizon, there can be some risks:

1. Tech, assuming you're talking about US tech, could hit growth stagnation. Netflix for example is clearly struggling with scaling. Unlike Google which can scale enormously Netflix has to raise prices everytime. Even Google can insert only so many ads in an youtube video or a search result.


2. Rise if China could come as a rude geopolitical awakening. They're going to spread their influence in growth markets like Africa pushing out US tech. Google and others have to play by strict rules not to bribe foreign governments but China has none of that.


3. Continuing animosity between the government and the tech companies. While any breakup is unlikely, new acquisitions also could become rare. Imagine a Google without Android and YouTube or a Facebook without Instagram.


4. Privacy issues. People are somewhat more aware about tech and privacy. Google's recent announcement of avoiding individual targeting is an example, also apple's removal of FB access to device id. Although these steps are not really going to be impactful to these companies, any new tracking mechanism could be difficult to implement.


5. European Union. This is probably the top 1 or 2 in this list. EU hates tech, justifiably so in many cases. They're trying to protect their citizens rights and their businesses. Going to be a constant issue although they won't be able to go beyond a certain point without pushback from the US government. It'll be occasional $5 billion fine every few years.


6. Global tax regime. So far these companies escaped heavy taxation by having arrangements with tax friendly jurisdictions like Ireland for Europe. After waiting for the US government to come to the table to develop a global framework, many individual countires are unilaterally imposing taxes on these companies for activities within their jurisdiction. That will be a problem as rax costs will rise for these companies.


7. Globalization. Increasing globalization can cause unrest because of a lack of good jobs and these companies will be the primary target irrespective of whoever gets elected. It's unpredictable what shape it will take but higher targeted taxation is a real possibility.

Obviously these are just thoughts and some are worst case hypotheticals. Nevertheless important."

We are starting to see hints of this, but Tech is too loosely regulated and it contributes a ton to their growth.

In order to actually make money on your investment in tech, the actual growth will have to exceed the expectations.

I mean the sector will probably grow and this is reflected in the current valuation of tech stocks. However there is a large degree of growth assumed in these valuations.

Whether or not these companies will grow as much as the market thinks, is not clear. If they don't grow as much as anticipated the valuations will plummet significantly. See Microsoft in 2000 e.g., would have taken you 15 years to break even from their valuation during the dotcom bubble."

It means that many think people are paying too much for it now and, eventually, it will lose a lot of its growth as it sinks back down to a regular price. Will it go back up again? A company like AAPL? Probably. But it might be better to wait until it goes down (which may even be in a year or two) and then buy in rather than buying at the top of that outrageous growth.

But in my opinion, unless something goes really wrong, tech is not only going to keep doing well, it's probably going to eat up almost all other industries.

But if one has to come up with some scenarios, I can think of the following:

1. **USA unstable (external) -** USA becoming unstable because of some major non-nuclear war.
2. **USA unstable (internal) -** USA becoming unstable because of internal conflicts.
3. **Severe Pandemic -**  A very severe pandemic that takes out even the delivery infrastructures (a relatively real possibility)
4. **Nuclear War -** A significant enough nuclear war that affect more than a few million people.
5. **Declining USA -** USA declining considerably in influence and a free country not rising up fast enough to take its top spot.
6. **Anti-tech Culture -** A cultural changes due to any reason that makes technology uncool or something not in vogue (hard to imaging this scenario, but could happen).
7. **Alien contact/disclosure -** This is a silly one of course. But given the numerous reports of UAPs abound nowadays, no one knows for sure what'd happen in the unlikely case if they do turn out to be for real. After listening to some credible people speak on it, I think it's a remote but reasonable possibility. E.g. - [Cmdr. David Fravor on Lex Fridman Podcast](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjb_IjS57LvAhWNURUIHbg-ChMQFjAAegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DaB8zcAttP1E&usg=AOvVaw1aQgJw_xHS4b_xcWIAB1GW).
8. **Major US Political Change -** Change in political nature of the US and other tech generating countries, such as becoming too socialistic to allow rapid innovation by privately owned companies.
9. **Any** [**Dark-age**](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/11/17106910/elon-musk-ai-threat-mars-moon-colonization-nukes-sxsw-2018) **Inducing Event -** like an extremely power solar flare or coronal mass ejection from the sun that kills a huge number of people, or an asteroid impact that although doesn't cause total extinction.
10. **Death of a Large Percentage of Humanity -** For any reason, if a significant percentage of humanity dies, the current large scale innovation economy will become unsustainable and it'd most likely collapse, with only small companies and efforts remaining trying to resurrect the great technological times we're living in right now."
03/15/2021,stocks,"This is just me thinking off the top of my head. I think that if we were in a depression, tech wouldn't grow."

If I wanted to make a bet like this, I might do something like 80% QQQ and 20% SPY/VOO. Then once a year or so, you can rebalance. This would reduce your risk. Check out “A Random Walk Down Wall Street,” which covers this in depth."

It's possible Zoom ends up being great for communication, valuations go high, then realize there's nothing more particularly innovative, other than being able to talk to people on a laptop, people start believing it's way overvalued, then starts to stop buying it, think it's way to pricy, thus prices now drop or stay flat for a while."

Just because tech companies will keep growing their revenue doesn't mean that their stock prices will keep growing. But it's possible of course.

If revenue growth slows down faster than expected (the growth is slowing down, not the revenue itself) then investors may rebalance their portfolios and pull some money out of tech stocks even if tech companies can are still growing their revenue."

That said, take all emotions out of investing. Use proper instruments (stocks preferred, avoid options unless you're familiar with its use, even that only occasionally).

Choose the companies wisely. Look at both the technicals and the fundamentals. F for choosing the company and T for the investment timing - both entry and exit.

Don't invest all at once even if you have the money. Also understand new risks like how bond yield affects tech even though that's going to go away imo, it can increase your initial cost.

Let's say you're researching Google.

Fundamentals side: You should look at ARPU, how it's calculated, how it's changed, cloud revenue projection, what's going on with android, ad tech changes, devices, Chrome, Android TV

Management (can't stress this enough). This is very important for this horizon.

Technical analysis: Know the basis, how to read the chart. Very, very important. You can invest without it but it can give you proper signals on the timing - if the stock is ripe for investment. You can checkout https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=20iECG65_To (Not affiliated with the channel not recommending any stock discussed in the video). 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3x4t2rLYXBw for volume profile (this is a day trading video but this is helpful for longterm also).

https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/ Don't look at the exact recommendations but look at why they're choosing that stock that day.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S72pwDRbK4o This is how big money managers think. It's important to understand that because they control the market.

Again, no recommendations of the channels or stocks discussed.

I'm emphasizing technicals because I've made the mistake of ignoring it in the past and paid for it. But still fundamentals are the most important part.

Don't put all your money at once. And know your companies. It's not a bad idea to keep the list small.

 Don't get too attached to the companies. If things don't work out and you think its not going to change soon you should be willing to switch. Same with losses.

Don't forget if you're investing in bigger companies they can be made obsolete by new companies as well.

Also keep your eye on general stuff, how they're transforming and how they might affect your portfolio: digital curr., transportation, energy etc.

Good luck."

03/15/2021,stocks,"I was actually about to mention something along these lines. It's not so much that the EU hates tech, but rather that an outsized portion of these major tech giants are North American companies, and subsequently don't have the same political presence and influence in Europe as they do in the US. Therefore EU regulation hits them pretty hard, and while Europe is a critical market for these tech companies to expand to (arguably the easiest market for NA tech companies to gain ground in due to cultural/economic similarities) they don't have the same sorts of tools, options, and leverage to protect their interests there like they do in the US (think lobbying, being major job providers, etc).

The EU is free to take popular political actions against big NA tech companies (social media is a big target because social media companies are overwhelmingly North American companies). But it's not like the EU would take actions to damage big EU companies--they are very careful not to overstep on large German or French companies for example, who have major political and economic clout."

Further, just because technology is being integrated into our lives more, doesn't mean it will be lead by the tech companies any individual chooses to hold or even tech companies that exist yet. 

I see a lot of people on Reddit paying insane prices for subpar companies just because ""technology is the future"". Imo you have to just treat companies on a case by case basis."

03/15/2021,stocks,The meaning of hedging is to counter your long positions. I hedged my ark long positions by buying puts last month. My realized profits with the puts offset my paper loses in ark. So that’s my understanding of hedging. Is this wrong?

03/15/2021,stocks,"You can look at Ark Invest research (not recommending the fund, just their research), their portfolio companies etc. Everything is free. Just google ARKK.

Motley Fool Industry Focus podcast (free, no need for Motley Fool subscription).

If you sign up for a free brokerage account and access some research (Chase YouInvest gives you acces to Chase research report).

You need to understand all the fundamental parameters like P/E, how to read balance sheet etc before or while you do this.

You can even install their apps/software/sign up for their product and see how it compares with others - if applicable.

Just pick one stock and follow the events such as news, earnings and see how the stock responds to each.

Not the least of all, the Company's website, it's investor relations page incl earnings, listening to earnings call recording, should give you a lot of idea (Public companies are technically required by the law to tell the truth unless they're projecting for future).

You can start with Yahoo Finance, a lot of stuff is in there.

Finviz

SEC filings will also give you a lot of info.

Understand the history of the company. Past will have a lot to say about the future.

Management salary, number of employees etc

Insider ownership, institutional ownership bith very important

In many cases you'll have to dig deep to exactly understand the core business. You'll also have to decide if the management is working for the shareholders. You can look at some CEOs and tell they have surgical precision in knowing anf doing exactly what's needed. In other cases management is greedy, short term oriented, buying back shares (not good for a growing company, may be good for others) etc.

You have to be able to form an opinion. But everything you need is available for free."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Your understanding of hedging is absolutely correct! 

But do note there is more than one way to hedge your positions other than what you mentioned. 

What I'm saying is that you can use a diversification strategy to hedge your position in tech stocks.

For example, if tech stock prices fall, the other stocks in a well diversified (and negatively correlated) portfolio will rise. The profits from these stocks will offset the losses in tech stocks. Hence, your position in tech stocks is hedged."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Just want to add:

https://stratechery.com and the podcast (Great analysis, unless you're managing big money or you're a venture capitalist you don't need paid subscription, free articles are good enough).

03/15/2021,stocks,Thank you :)
03/15/2021,stocks,Wouldn’t that just mean to buy an index fund?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Just to make sure I didn't mean to say Ark's picks are good or bad. Just their research methodology and how they approach things is more transparent. Like they have podcasts and YouTube videos, their research is free. Many institutions do great research it's just not readily available to retail investors.

For every Ark, there's five people that say these companies aren't good. The task for an investor is to read both and see who's more correct.

You can also easily find some analysts that literally go after a stock relentlessly for seemingly no reason. Nasty stuff like whenever the stock falls, they'll issue another downgrade. If you're into a stock you have to be aware of them too.

But as always anyone can be right or wrong, intentionally or unintentionally. Wall Street is filled with minefield for retail investors so you'll have to question everything and form an opinion yourself.

It's a great skillset to have especially as your investment potential grows. If you listen to one of the links above the hedge fund manager says Ark might not be able to survive all future cycles. He may be right, he could also be wrong. I don't think he's any ill will towards Ark unlike many folks that go after the fund, he's stating his opinions but she's also his competition.

For us, as individuals, the way is to constantly adapt to the environment and whatever the market throws at us."
03/15/2021,stocks,"That's why I invest in Ark: I trust them to know what's in the pipeline at companies like SQ, which companies' market penetration has maxed out (Netflix, as mentioned above? Why else crack down on password sharing now?), and when/how much to buy. Creating one's own tech ETF without years in the industry and tons of money to weather rough periods -- let alone buy those dips, like Ark does -- seems really risky."

That's just my experience so far. I found that people here are VERY reluctant to use technology. Even something as simple as Credit cards, wireless paying, Apple/Google Pay. Stuff like that. It's better now with the pandemic. But, beforehand, I was so annoyed at the lack of tech being used over here."

But, I'm going to bet you that it's probably very hard to maintain them and at some point the cost-analysis of doing so maybe more. OR you may have a security exploit that you're unaware of. If not, then good on you guys. I would probably market that server then."
03/15/2021,stocks,Not in the way he described I can promise you.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Idk. Being an old school Unix admin/programmer, I can't understand what's so hard in admining a few boxes.

It's the new gullible generation with zero skill and zero lerning ability that bothers me :-)"
03/15/2021,stocks,"In exactly the way he described.

Look up ""fully homomorphic encryption"", which doesn't actually exist yet but is intended to change the way computing works so that the instructions change to operate on the encrypted data and it never has to be placed in memory unencrypted.

Until then, the only security in the cloud is physical security, so if the cloud operator is dirty, all your data are belong to them."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'd definitely say it's probably scalability. If you have some standard SQL server db doing basic tasks and you're only computing say like 200k/transactions a second. Meh, that's fine. It's when you get up more than that and/or have to start manipulating the data to an API is where I see the problems. But if you're just retrieving tables and spitting it out. Not an issue."
03/15/2021,stocks,I did not say that the attack vector was not possible. The amount of profits made by implementing something like this would be dwarfed in comparison to the losses if they were caught doing it.  Not to mention all the breaches of contract. Give me an example of this happening on a major US cloud provider since you say it already is.

03/15/2021,stocks,"If youre only getting 5 stocks, make sure at least one is a non-sector ETF; something that will get you general market exposure. It also depends on how long you plan on holding. Techy stocks like the ones being mentioned are typically more volatile so if youre 60 planning to retire in five years Im not sure if theyre your best bet. Blue chip stocks are usually a safe bet and pretty great; but if youre in your 20s I wouldn't reccomend putting 100% of your investment in them since your risk tolerance would be pretty high. 


Honestly though, if youre just starting off Id go with a paper trading account that has a variety of stocks in it. It would absolutely suck to only have 5 stocks and see them tank like growth stocks did a couple of weeks ago.

2021-03-15 11:51:33,stocks,"What do you think of $FLGT? I purchased shares of FLGT back in November at about $33/share and rode that up to about $50 before selling due to the high daily price volatility.

Unfortunately I missed a lot of potential gains and the FOMO had me in again at $90, with which I rode the short squeeze up to about $180 before selling half my position. I am still holding a number of shares, although I, like many shareholders, am concerned about the post-COVID business operations.

I understand that Fulgent is by no means entirely a COVID-testing company, but it would be stupid to ignore the fact that the immense growth was basically entirely driven by the pandemic. The question is, will this growth in COVID-testing act as a catalyst for growth in Fulgent’s other intriguing business offerings? It’s difficult to say. 

However, Fulgent is only trading at about a 6.5x Price/Sales, with a 51% profit margin despite its age. These are things that I find tough to overlook. Perhaps now isn’t the time to invest, assuming it drops following the news of any improvement in pandemic outlooks, but I find it difficult to describe it as “overvalued”.

These are just my two-cents, I am not an expert, and I’m curious to hear your input!"

I've done a bit of research and liking what I've reading but am interested to hear some other opinions.  I've chosen these based on decent buy ratings, they're earning money not loosing it, CAD so there's no fees from the app and I want to support Canadian companies. 

Chorus Aviation ($CHR)

Magna International ($MG)

Village Farms ($VFF)

CHR is picking up again with loosened up restrictions is seams. I like the diversity of their business supplying and flying.

MG is going to be making parts for some up and coming EV manufacturers.

VFF produces food which is important, but also getting into cannabis/CBD and clean energy (natural gas via landfills)

Any quick opinions?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm also considering Blackberry for long term. ($BB). I've bought small amounts of shares and sold for tiny gains already, indisive the first time and the second to reallocate funds for Roblox ($RBLX) which I didn't buy yet because I couldn't get in closer to $45 and probably won't unless it dips closer to that."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Seems like some reasonable picks on the more speculative side of things. I have Air Canada, Blackberry, and Village Farms. Air Canada is on the cusp of a government bailout, and is doing well on positive news of vaccines and opening up. VFF has some U.S. exposure to cannabis as well, which is a pretty hot commodity these days. Blackberry got caught in the meme community but has some positives outside of that phenomenon. Roblox listed at $60 or so and was a little rich for my blood."
03/15/2021,stocks,Good thanks.  Yeah I liked what I was hearing about blackberry but was second guessing my decision because of the WSB hype.  I'll probably buy it again.  I've also been considering Air Canada.  I'm just not sure if it's the right time to buy.
03/15/2021,stocks,Chorus and Air Canada tend to move in tandem so if you have one I’m not sure you’d really need the other anyways.
03/15/2021,stocks,I was looking at that making a similar correlation.   Also I chose chorus over air Canada because it looks like they have a dividend wheres I don't think AC does.

2021-03-15 09:50:04,stocks,"With new stimulus en route, would it be dumb to move all my VTI to something more aggressive like VIOO JUST for the next few days?? Title says it all. If I had like 40K+ in VTI and everyone is expecting a green week with the stimulus checks being deposited as we speak, would I be able to make a lot more by selling all my VTI to invest in something more aggressive like VIOO or VGT or ARK or SPY (or anything else? any recommendations)? Once things settle down, I could move back to VTI because I am fairly conservative and risk averse.

Not sure if this is worth it but I am tempted. If I sell VTI, I've had less than a few months so I'd pay taxes on my gains which are about $1k. Otherwise, if i don't sell for this, I will probably keep the majority of it in there longterm only selling some if I really want to buy another ETF or stock at some point. 

Would this make sense? Alternatively, I could put it in actual stocks. I'm eyeing a few but not at the point where I can do my own tech analysis yet. Thing's I'm eyeing are PLTR, ICLN, TSLA, DKNG, SPY, RBLX, RKT, NIO, *maybe G--M-E* to try and swing a few shares, but would not be holding longterm - probably would buy and sell intra day, few days at most.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Unless they're making money, it's all speculation and with a couple of exceptions most pharma 'growth' stocks aren't making money...yet!

What that means though is that at any time one or a handful of large investors can pull out for one reason or another and crater a stock or kill its momentum."
03/15/2021,stocks,Biotechs can be highly volatile.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Small cap pharma and biotech stocks are very volatile because the process of discovering a drug/method of use, filing a patent, going through preclinical and clinical trials, getting approval, and bringing it into the market is expensive, costing an average of $2-3 billion and the process usually takes over 10 years. There are investors who will speculate on these companies as they go through these phases, becoming an integral part of funding the $2-3 billion capital but if they fail at any stage of the process (clinical trials, FDA approval, even postmarket surveillance), the stock can tank over 50%. Conversely, a success can easily send a stock doubling, tripling, and to the moon and an example of that is with the eyes stock."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Biotech is not for beginners unless you have already have a very good understanding of the industry.

Drug development goes through several 'phases' and a drug can fall apart at any one of those stages.  Phase 3 is the final stage and often requires huge amounts (billions), which a lot of smaller companies obviously don't have, so they tend to get bought out or partner for Phase 3.

Just remember that it is absolutely a gamble each time, if a drug passes phase 1 the stock will soar, but then it could fail phase 2 and the stock will tank, in some cases the company can fail.

Even if you understand a lot of the science and marketing, you can't predict the outcomes of the trials, and even a successful drug can fail in the market.

By all means throw money at them, you can get really rich from biotech, but you can also end up in the poor house a lot easier.  90% of drugs fail to get approval and that will obviously affect the stock price, hard.

Also worth bearing in mind, trials take years, so if you can't stand the idea that what you put money in lost 50+% of its value for over 6-12 months then don't play biotech.  You need to spread your risk, pick multiple winners and hope at least a handful succeed, and suck up the losses.

""Buying the dip"" is a pretty poor strategy for biotech if you don't understand anything about the dips you're buying, they aren't Apple or Microsoft, they're not guaranteed to still  be around in 3-5 years."

But we hate teladoc. If it's not a basic thing, we need you in person for an actual exam.

If they can allow the provider to examine you somehow, fantastic, but until we can do your vitals and listen to your lungs / abdomen / heart and have a high enough quality camera to visualize what we need to properly...


Teladocs refer to in person visits for many things, we have had  people come in for years saying ""I did a teladoc and they told me I need an actual exam for my rash / UTI etc"""
03/15/2021,stocks,"I’m sure there are a few correct answers in the thread. Something to keep in mind as well, we just had a market shift from growth stocks to value stocks. That’s why huge tech companies like Tesla have seen huge drops as well. These dips aren’t because the companies have down poorly (with the exception of some). The transition of the market happens from time to time due to things like bond yields, inflation, and tax changes. Unfortunately companies that are more volatile are seen less favorable at this time. You’ll also see ETF’s for tech such as Cathie Wood’s $ARKK have dipped too but index on value companies are up. Hope this helps and if you believe in your growth companies buying the dip is recommended. Dips are discounts on good stocks or early warning signs on crap companies you’ll need to do your own DD."

I recently learned about the FDA calendar. If a drug passed phase 3 without major problems (and probably even already authorised in EU or Canada) , shouldn't it have a very good chance by the PDUFA phase? Not 100%, but good enough that it's worth it to invest in most of them (after a basic DD), with the hope that a few going to the moon should more than outweigh a few others plummeting?"

If it's approved by other countries there is a good chance of approval, that said it's still extremely risky because of the upfront costs of development if the company isn't one of the big dogs one failure will almost certainly kill the company.

I say this as someone who works in biotech, if you have a friend who works in the industry they will be an invaluable source. Also unlike a lot of companies or industries the Financials honestly don't mean much when it comes to biotech, only the drug trials amd their outcome."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Check out pg 7 of the link below for some breakdowns through various stages.

As you can see the 90% failure rate is stage 1 to approval and the biggest drop off is stage 1 to 2.  And passing stage 3 is a roughly 85% change of approval beyond that, so maybe a bigger risk than you might expect.

As said, it was only last week that I learnt about the FDA calendar. Before that, I saw a million times how a pharma company skyrocketed thanks to good news, but had no idea that the date was public beforehand.

So I just plan to take a look at the calendar, filter those that are in the final phase (approval), check what the analysts and insiders ares saying and doing and how the previos phases went out, invest if it looks good and wait for the massive rise, which according to the report above, should happen 85% of the time, more than that with certain diseases, and then sell immediately.

I'll be paper trading for a while, and then I'll see..

Thanks for your input"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Thank you very much for that link, that file is a goldmine of information!

For starters, 10% overall success (from zero to approval) is much bigger than what I expected, but obviously not good enough to YOLO all my savings on it.

On the other hand, 85%, or more than 90% in some diseases, seems like a very good rate. I know that the few that fail plummet badly, but those that are successful go up so much that I guess that investing on them should be a good idea.

In any case, I recently created an excel file using data from the calendar. I'll track those companies and see how it goes.

Thanks again for the link!"
03/15/2021,stocks,No worries! Investing long-term as opposed to hoping for a quick buck.
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you're looking for a quick buck biotech is not a good choice,  because the good news is almost always followed by bad, whether that be from the drug not being effective, alot of things can go wrong in the pre-approval phase and it can tank hard and tank much faster than you'll be able to sell."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Sorry to interject. That's not what long means, and it's going to cause confusion. Long = buying shares hoping to sell at a higher price, as opposed to short = borrowing shares to sell now hoping to buy back at a lower price."

03/15/2021,stocks,"How so?

Again, I'm a noob, but I just checked the last 15 drugs to be approved (since mid-Feb), and despite the ""mini-crisis"" we have gone through in the last month, only a few lost a bit, several stayed more or less the same, and most increased somewhere between 10 and 90%. And I didn't even bother filtering out those that had had bad news in the past or bad ratings from analysts or whatever...  

I know that stocks decrease fast after the good news, but when I say ""quick"" buck, I mean really quick (sell on the same day that the news breaks out, even if the price is still going up).   

Again, right now all I have is a simple Excel file. I want to see if the price really increases as much as I read (it seems it does), and then somewhere in the future get into a more detailed DD."
03/15/2021,stocks,My bad! Doesn't change original statement of going long.
03/15/2021,stocks,"These are approval plays, I fucking love biotech but absolutely don't recommend it if you don't know the industry. If you do know the industry these are still not low risk stocks, and they can trade sideways for a long time before making a move either way. 

This is the last place I'd throw money in your position."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Then you're probably better off checking out pennystocks, but they're a gamble. Keep in mind that anything below $5 starts getting risky, but look for:

NVDA 29% p.a.

ASML 23.5% p.a

TSM 11.5% p.a

Other semis have done a better job not only in revenue growth but in their expenses / capital management. 

Even with technological leadership, I would rank them on the same level as Intel. What's the point of tech leadership if you don't translate it into revenues and profits?

Intel has lagged in tech but they're still able to grab revenues and profits. 

The best companies are AMD, NVDA, ASML because they not only deliver on tech but they translate it into growing revenues and profits."

03/15/2021,stocks,How much is the contract?
03/15/2021,stocks,I don't think there's a literal silicon shortage. It's the production of silicon chips that's the issue. Everyone just refers to it as a silicon shortage.
03/15/2021,stocks,"To add to that:

Company that builds chip machines is ASML.

Good example of a company using those machines to build chips are intel, tsmc and samsung.

These are all very different companies in their own way. So it could be interesting to look into them and figure out how and why they are so different."

03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm not sure if you're aware, AMD, NVDA dones't actually produce chips, but are chip designers.  They outsource the majority of manufacturing to TSMC and Samsung.  So I am curious how TSMC is speculative."
03/15/2021,stocks,how is tsmc speculative?just curious
03/15/2021,stocks,"Short term I am not super bullish on Intel, but long term I think they have a good chance of being a great investment. 

Their PE is very low compared to the other big players in the semiconductor industry. 

I think just as a matter of national security, Intel won’t be allowed to fail. 
I just don’t see a world in which the US is fine having all CPU production come from Taiwan and South Korea. They are great allies, but it’s too important of an asset to rely on foreign powers near China to handle all supply. 

I think 3-5+ years out, Intel catches up technology wise 


Or, I’m completely wrong and x86 starts rapidly losing market share and custom CPUs from others like Apple and AMD keep stealing market and TSM / Samsung produce them all."

The problem with fabless companies is that they are riskier as they have a shallower moat. ASML is good but that one is overhyped even more than TSMC.

I would  say ASML and TSMC are solid low growth, low risk stocks. If you want more risk then AMD is the best bet imo."

This news cycle is so fricking frustrating and the speculation is so stupidly volatile I just don't see them as a reliable investment. Chip manufacturing trades relies heavily on US-based manufacturing and outsource manufacturing.

03/15/2021,stocks,AMD is using x86_64 architecture that is extension of original x86 (and intel is also using this architecture).
03/15/2021,stocks,"My hot take on $INTC is that, an educated investor will invest only when they have a huge shakeup on management. Sure, strong company but their management is bringing the whole company down. They are incompetent and ancient.

Moreover, I will sell my house and buy INTC when they start divesting. They are a monolithic company with a crap ton of bad investments that are bleeding them down. So they need a huge shakeup that can only be triggered by activist investors. So, I have to keep an eye on that.

If you bought INTC at mid 40s, I have nothing against you. Smart move. But there are better trades compared to INTC at the current price. INTC's price is leveraging hard on a Biden semiconductor deal."
03/15/2021,stocks,"x86 ain't going away anytime soon, ARM CPUs are great for efficiency but the x86 instruction set has a lot more computational power."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Aye, and most of Chinese cities are in range of Taiwanese missiles, and US aircraft carriers are usually nearby. In case of war between the two price of TSMC would indeed collapse but that would be least of your worries."
03/15/2021,stocks,China does not possess a single battleship. Neither does anyone else - they're an incredibly obsolete weapons platform.
03/15/2021,stocks,TSM is *already* on top
03/15/2021,stocks,Right but what I mean is that AMD is not actually fabricating. They are just designing and letting TSM do the magic.
03/15/2021,stocks,"But don’t you get to a point where the efficiency trumps all ? Like, say you are talking servers and super computers - x86 is faster per CPU , but if ARM is faster per watt, you’d just want more ARM to make up the difference. 

I can see specialized cases where you want one really fast CPU , but that seems to be getting more and more limited."
03/15/2021,stocks,You're assuming a single shell placed in a cleanroom would cause a whole war.
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you want to explain the difference between a gunboat, destroyer, missile frigate, corvette, etc., then have at.

I was making a general point, not allocating resources.

The Chinese would throw a rock through Taiwan's window for whatever reason they choose. It's a risk that should be in TSMC's prospectus if it isn't already."
03/15/2021,stocks,Is it gonna stay there? Is it gonna go *any* higher? I personally don't know. And I can't even buy SMH. Not even SMH Ucits.
03/15/2021,stocks,"If i remember correctly, CISC architectures like x86 are capable of running more complex instructions than RISC, so there are some use cases where CISC is beneficial. However I may be wrong here, it’s been a while since I learned about ISAs."
03/15/2021,stocks,And you're thinking otherwise? It'd be a catalyst first and foremost.
03/15/2021,stocks,"TSMC ruined Huawei. If China wants to ruin the rest of it’s tech industry the easiest way would be to shell TSMC. 

Not to mention the possible sanctions by Taiwan. The big three electronics assemblers in the world, FoxConn, Pegatron and Wistron, are responsible for around 5 million jobs in China. Then there’s Asus, Gigabyte, Acer, MSI and the rest of the gang who have production factories in China."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes, it’s likely to stay on top because semiconductor manufacturing requires billions of dollars of investment and years of development before you start pumping out chips that actually work.

Betting against the incumbent is the speculative play here. New manufacturers may do well but they aren’t going to be serious players for a decade at least."
03/15/2021,stocks,TSMC has the most advanced process. No one can't compete with them
03/15/2021,stocks,"Iran put three cruise missiles into a Saudi refinery.

Where's the shooting war?

Small provocations don't cause multi-year battles any more.

The situation would have to be much more unstable, with several other serious and harmful provocations leading up to it, and that shell would have to be a clearly telegraphed last straw."
03/15/2021,stocks,And yet it's completely plausible that China would do that. It's got a long history of crapping on corporations for purely political reasons. Ask Jack Ma if he can still do anything he wants.

For example. Let’s say GME is at $250

I want to buy a put expiring in a week saying that GME will go to $50

Let’s say GME goes to $40 a share

Do I make the the difference between $250 and $40

Or do I make the difference between $50-$40

This might be a completely ridiculous question. And I understand GME won’t be at $50 in week it’s just an example. I also understand buying one contract is x100

To try to put it in simpler terms, Let’s say one contract was just one share not 100. If I buy a put of GME while it’s currently sitting at $250 and I think Ittl hit $50 in 7 days. And it goes down to $40.

Do I make $210 or do I make $10

Thank you"

03/15/2021,stocks,"Coulda, shoulda, woulda. 

I'm gonna go out on a limb and say if you're not okay with seeing yourself lose 10% of the amount invested, you probably shouldn't be trading.

Trading is difficult because, for example, just as that stock went up 2 bucks, it could have gone down 2 bucks and you'd be down 8% (if you realized the gain/loss).

In my trading account I've had times where I've been down 50% in just a few weeks (do a lot of long dated options trading for leverage or penny stocks since it's not too big of amount where trading just stock would do much), but can also see weeks where I get more than a 50% return.  Granted, since I do a lot more riskier stuff it's a lot higher risk/rewsrd.

In short, obviously we all invest/trade to make money, but it's not always going to happen. If you're doing shorter trades, you're going to realize some losses, and sometimes some pretty decent sized losses. If you can't stomach a 10% loss at some point (bc they do happen) I'd suggest just looking to do a longer term strategy. If you're comfortable, put some more money from the savings account so you're gains can be a bit more. Just pick good value companies that are going to be around for a while.

Edit: should note, trading is not necessarily investing, since it's typically shorter trends your trading on. Investing is a bit longer term. A lot of people use the terms interchangeably, but they're pretty different. But my post is encouraging investing, and saying you shouldn't go the trading route unless you're comfortable with seeing some decent size losses at times"

03/15/2021,stocks,Everyone said not to including the media but I yolo’d  3k on AMC and am up $2200 on my first trade out of paper money. Still at a nice price and a very hot stock right now.  Just my opinion.
03/15/2021,stocks,"50 shares of THCX. They’re trading for around $21 a pop. I’ve done my Research and they have amazing growth potential. Look into them and let me know what you think. It’s pretty hard to deny the fact that cannabis will be federally legalized soon. And NY is being heavily pressured to legalize it on their next vote later this year. Again look into them let me know what you think. Also amazing dividend yield. I absolutely love them for long holds.

I would also recommend slowly investing at least 20% of you savings into other ETFs as well. That money can be making money instead of sitting their waiting to be spent."

To exploit that collective ingenuity, I would like to pose a question to the group:  what are some of the emerging technologies/industries that you think will shape our near-term future?

I know that companies like Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Square, etc will all be big players in the years ahead, but they're already here.  I'm trying to identify some legitimate, paradigm-shifting stuff that isn't really on the map yet, but is lurking around the corner, and will start having profound impacts 5-10 years down the road.

https://youtu.be/aR5N2Jl8k14
Although I do not believe Artificial General Intelligence will not be realized until 10-100yrs from now, I believe the advancements in algorithms that produce more capable  machine learning and adaptive learning principles will, over the next decade, will lead to unfathomable gains in efficiencies. This will spur other automatic advancements in all STEM fields and seep effortlessly into our every day lives, assisting us at work and making us more valuable then ever imagined. 

Quantum Computing (Infinite computing)
https://youtu.be/kEJBxotcxRw
With quantum computing we can transform medicine, break encryption and revolutionise communications and artificial intelligence.

 Let’s talk about that for a second. AI and quantum technologies go hand in hand. The quantum computers of the next decade will have the potential to rapidly accelerate the development of artificial intelligence. 
From improving self-driving cars to modelling chemical reactions.

Right now, supercomputers can only analyse the most basic molecules. But quantum computers operate using the same quantum properties as the molecules they’re trying to simulate. They will have no problem handling even the most complicated reactions, unlocking many secrets hidden in our universe. 

More efficient products like new composites for structures or even batteries in electric cars, better and cheaper drugs, or vastly improved solar panels. 

Quantum computers will find a use anywhere where there’s a large, uncertain complicated system that needs to be simulated. That could be anything from predicting the financial markets, to improving weather forecasts, to modelling the behaviour of individual electrons. 

Quantum encryption keys could not be copied or hacked. They would be completely unbreakable and change the way we protect information. 

Augmented Reality/HMI’s
https://youtu.be/yuRV27c8HDw
HMI’s or human machine interfaces will be critical for us to benefit fully from quantum and AI gains. The implementation of hardwired interfaces like Neuralink, which full capabilities are still off in the future, the more readily available smart glasses and AR systems such as Hololens will allow us to interact with the digital realm giving us real time information for work or personal time. 

3D Printing
https://youtu.be/NZSWFHslzE0
Manufacturing of new devices, chips, equipment and machined parts will completely change how we buy our products. Another game changer will be in housing, facilitating quick and affordable shelters for out exponential population growth.  A subsection of housing with be habitats that will be built off world on lunar colonies, Mars and within the astroid belt.

Fusion Energy Production
This is the answer to a problem we have been expecting for decades. Even if energy efficiency continues to keep pace, our increasing population and the proliferation of technology to the underdeveloped world will put vast strains on our electrical output. This is complicated even further if we increase production with sources that produce destructive waste like coal or uranium. It will only be sustainable if we can produce a scalable clean source of power. Enter fusion! With an estimated cost of .06¢/kWh of clean energy, the scalability of adding many devices,  and the miniaturizing over time... we are on the threshold of endless-clean-affordable energy. The best part is the new SPARK fusion reactor is scheduled to come online by 2030."

03/15/2021,stocks,"*Had to repost because I named a stock that's not allowed.*

A few spaces where I see huge potential:

* Plant-based foods: A lot of these products have been getting extremely good. I'm not a vegetarian myself and doubt I ever will be, but I've been eating a lot less meat due to the really good plant-based alternatives for an affordable price. People have also started to realize that if we want to reduce climate change, virus outbreaks and animal suffering, eating less meat is a hard requirement. On top of that, plant-based food will become a lot cheaper to make as companies develop the technology and reach mass scale, while meat will only become more expensive as we start taxing carbon emissions properly and animal welfare requirements become more strict. Stocks to watch: TTCF and 0SI.F (Frankfurt listing for company I wasn't allowed to name).

* Lab grown meat: This could eventually displace plant-based foods and the remainder of the real meat industry. That said, it's still in its infancy and will probably need another decade before it becomes economically viable. I personally plan to ride the plant-based wave for 5-10 years and then switch to lab-grown meat investments. Stocks to watch: None yet.

* Genomics : Don't have much more to add than what others have already said around this sub. This will change our world more than 99.9% of people realize. Stocks to watch: Just check ARKG's holdings.

* Freelance space: Everything in the world is going global, and the freelance space is no exception. There's been some stigma on freelancing due to low pay, low quality work from India and platforms with a focus on unprofessional environments like Fiverr, but this space has huge potential. I personally run a business that makes video games and the amount of high quality talent you can work with online nowadays is amazing. Not just individuals but even other studios. The enterprise future of freelancing is huge. Stocks to watch: UPWK.

* Weed: Obvious story with all the legalization happening around the world. Eventually the space will mature and a few winners will emerge to become large multinational companies, but it's difficult to predict which ones. Stocks to watch: Heard some good things about HITIF and GTEC, but haven't researched them enough yet.

* Space: SpaceX has made commercial space companies a reality. We are closer to asteroid mining than people realize, which will be the biggest economic opportunity since Europeans set sail to the New World. That said, it's still too early to really invest in this. Stocks to watch: None as long as SpaceX is private, all the other companies are nowhere compared to them.

* Crypto: Lot's of people, myself included, prefer(ed) to ignore this as long as they could, but we've gotten to a point where the adoption of crypto is inevitable and you might as well get in early. BTC will replace gold and expand the store of value market, others will replace traditional transactional currencies, although it's not clear yet what the winner(s) will be in this area. Currencies to watch: BTC and maybe ETH, everything else is a gamble."

2021-03-15 07:49:26,stocks,"Question on how Capital Gains are calculated short-term to long-term. From my understanding, Capital gains are tax rates that are applied based on my gains as well as annual income.

If I were to cash out from a stock that I held on to for less than a year, that would be considered as short-term gain, also follows a higher tax rate.

To mitigate this, I might be tempted to store the gains into a different (or same) stock for a year to make it a long-term gain.

*Scenario (Trying to keep it simple):*

Suppose I fancy a stock named ""XYZ"" and after cashing out, I have a portfolio value of $100.

In January, I decided to partially invest $10 into XYZ for several months and I have $90 of unspent gains.

For some reason, I decide that it is completely rational for me to YOLO the remaining $90 in **April**.

So I basically dumped my remaining gains on XYZ stock and held it there.

*Here comes the question:*

Would I need to wait until January before it is safe for me to cash out fully to call it long-term gains or does it need to be until **April**?

Hope this question makes sense!"
03/15/2021,stocks,There is no such thing as storing a gain.  Once you sell a share of stock you have created a taxable event regardless of whether you invest those gains again later.
03/15/2021,stocks,Bless you and help me too
03/15/2021,stocks,It is 1 year from when you purchase the stock. If you buy some in Jan and some in April then it will be a year from both of those. So in Jan the following year those shares will be 1 year and tax as long term and in April those shares will be at 1 year and turn long term.
03/15/2021,stocks,"You must hold the stock for a year from the date of purchase in order for the long term capital gains to kick in. As soon as you sell, you are obligated to tax. It does not matter if you buy another stock with it. You are taxed per each sell."

03/15/2021,stocks,">Capital gains are tax rates that are applied based on my gains as well as annual income.

Capital gains are what you make from selling stocks at a profit, and capital gains tax is the rate you're taxed based on how much you made, and how long you held the securities you sold.

>Would I need to wait until January before it is safe for me to cash out fully to call it long-term gains or does it need to be until April?

This is where tax lots come into play. 

Each time you buy more of a security, a new tax lot is created. So if you hold your purchase in January to January of next year, that will eventually qualify for the long term capital gains tax rate."
03/15/2021,stocks,"This makes sense, thank you."

## The Fundamentals of Olympic Steel - My Level of Safety

Olympic Steel is a microcap with a market cap of only about $150M as of Feb 1st, 2021. The current stock price of $14 is still near its 5 year low. Here are my key metrics on Olympic Steel and why I like my margin of safety:

* Current assets of $395M and current Liabilities of only $96M, a current ratio over 4! Also a net current surplus of about $300M - with a market cap of only $150M!
* $233 of the current assets is in inventory as of Sept, 30th 2020. This inventory should be valued much higher with the surge in steel prices.
* Only $177M in Debt as of Sept, 30th 2020.
* So the net capital surplus minus the debt is over $120M.
* The net asset value of $24 a share, so its price to book is 50%.
* For Year-end 2019, produced over $120M of free cash flow. Almost the size of its current market capitalization!
* The last quarterly results in Sept. 2020 showed about $23M of free cash flow.

As stated at the beginning of this article, it is very hard to find ""value"" in today's market. Many firms are trading many multiples of book value - Olympic Steel trades at a ridiculous 50% of book.

## Recent Key Acquisition to Drive Olympic Steel Even Higher

On Dec. 14th, 2020 announced that it has acquired the assets of Action Stainless & Alloys, Inc., the Company's fourth acquisition in the past three years. The all-cash purchase is **immediately accretive.** I like the word accretive!

* So many cities - where I am from there were only a few major cities with direct flights from each to each other. There were no hub airports etc. Building a high speed rail along the busiest air routes made sense, but like America, the next problem was the big one
* High land prices, private land ownership, strict regulations, varied ownership and interests - just look at the people trying to build energy pipelines. I think the statistics were ""1 permit per mile"", that's a lot of permits. They have to travel through tribal lands, certain people don't want it etc. It just gets too hard
* Cost of safety, unions, varying state laws- American worker safety is world class, the problem is that it's part of the reason it's so expensive to build anything. Safety is paramount, but it's very expensive to run a big project safely. Bring Unions in and you have cocktail of cost increases and demands. 

In the end, the project costs so much that a ticket would be more than a flight. It might be worth it if it connected airports together for travelers that didn't happen to live exactly where the train left and want to go exactly where it ended up, but that adds a ton of cost as well. 

In China, they can just steal the land, use slave labor, build the trains with cheap motivated workers. Here in the USA we will probably pause the project because someone was mis-gendered. We are following the path of other mature civilizations before us, and we know how it ends ..."

03/15/2021,stocks,Gold isn't an inflation hedge... It's correlated to real yields.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Are bank stocks an inflation hedge if interest rates stay low?

Interest rate risk is not equal to inflation risk.

Farmland is excellent inflation risk hedge. Food goes up when inflation goes up. Food is made at farms. Farms do great when we have inflation.

The Fed often raises interest rates in response to increased inflation. That’s bad for some farms. Unfortunately, most farms must borrow to plant and pay off at harvest.

So... banks good inflation bad interest rates. And gold is the opposite. As we have seen, gold goes down as interest rates rise.

Your larger point is still probably valid. We are in an era of rising interest rates. That’s usually bad for real estate with existing loans. 

i own 3 REITs so sensitive to interest rates that I can’t see buying another until interest rates stabilize."

Let's say I invested $10,000 into stock A for $10 per share.

My unrealized gains are +$15,000.

Would I be taxed for selling this?   
Sorry if it sounds confusing.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes, you get taxed for your gains on the 400 shares. So for 400×$15 = $6000. You still have $9000 of unrealized gains."
03/15/2021,stocks,"you're paying on the gains of each individual share you sell. the fact you bought all your shares for the same amount that you sold a portion of your shares for is irrelevant.

you paid $10/share, then sold some shares at $25/share, so you'll pay tax on $15 each for them.

if you had bought in at different times where all the shares had different prices, you could set your brokerage to sell specific shares (like first in - first out to sell the oldest shares, cheapest first to sell the shares with the cheapest cost basis, expensive first to sell with the highest cost basis, and so on).

03/15/2021,stocks,I'm shorting your age. *Pulls out knife*
03/15/2021,stocks,Do you really think aapl will have the same growth and return as a mature company as it did as a startup?
03/15/2021,stocks,Just started a year ago.
03/15/2021,stocks,Liquid or assets
03/15/2021,stocks,That's right brotha!
03/15/2021,stocks,Probably? Hahah you had to do that until like 2000s
03/15/2021,stocks,Very wise
03/15/2021,stocks,That's right
03/15/2021,stocks,No.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Right.  Do you see aapl going out of business? Any of the faangs?  I don't.  So put 2000 in each and sit back.  I'm pretty sure in 10 years I'll have more money.  Maybe not a million .... But that's ok.

Best bet is 5000 in QQQ. Worst case you lose 2500 best .... Well .... Then you add a little more on dips."
03/15/2021,stocks,You don't.  You take a gamble.  Just like you do walking across the street.
03/15/2021,stocks,Who knows?  Maybe. I'm sure the next 10 years will be good.
03/15/2021,stocks,I meant this guy above me but I’m not gonna entertain it. How can one complain about making $1.5m for sitting on $1k over x years? Would be awesome. Wasn’t alive yet then to get in on the action lol
03/15/2021,stocks,If it’s that easy then why not just put 100% of your portfolio into AAPL? I’d say that’s probably not the best strategy but if you’re so confident in the “invest in FAANG and sit back” strategy then diversification away from tech will only limit your returns.
03/15/2021,stocks,"But you’re here saying how easy it is. “Just invest $1000 in a sure-shot tech company and you’ll be a millionaire if you just hold it long enough.” Good luck picking the correct entry points on the correct tech companies, as well as knowing which company’s dips or peaks are temporary or not."
03/15/2021,stocks,So your 100% positioned in aapl?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Would be awesome, hell is put in ten k if you knew that payout, but you’re talking about a long play on one of the more profitable stocks. Not trying to hate but I just consider that being patient and lucky. You can make a million off a thousand significantly faster doing other forms of trading but not buy sitting on one stock"
03/15/2021,stocks,I did.  I have $6k sitting in AAPL. I also have other investments cause I like being diversified.
03/15/2021,stocks,My point was to put 1000 in a faang and wait 20 years or so or put your money in QQQ.
03/15/2021,stocks,Nope never said that
03/15/2021,stocks,Why not if it’s a guarantee millions if you just hold? Putting $ anywhere else would be a waste
03/15/2021,stocks,I was making an example!  AAPL is one of the best stocks to own.  I got a 30% return last year in AAPL.  We'll see.  I say it continues to be a great company.  If it doesn't then a lot of sp500 indexes are going to be going down also.
03/15/2021,stocks,You could throw a dart and get a 100% return this past year. I got a nearly 200% return on MGM.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Not necessarily.  To expect 100% in one year is being greedy and part of what is the problem with new ""investors"" mostly in their 20s.  

These kids are part of a generation that thinks people owe them something and that it's easy to get rich.  They'll find out real life kicks in some day.  You get older and you develop expensive health problems, divorce, etc.  It's not easy!

10 to 12% is a more realistic return and some would even think that's high.

Just because you got a 100% return does not mean it can't be taken back very quickly.

I had a 106% return in SQ, but I buy and hold and now I'm near a more reasonable 20% return and climbing again as of late."
03/15/2021,stocks,"My point was that his argument about aapl being a sure growth shot almost as good now as it was in 1985 because he made 100%+ on it last year isn’t a good litmus test. Almost any stock bought between March and august last year doubled or more.

But your boomer is definitely showing with your “kids these days” comment 🙄"

If your investing or plan on investing in the near future and your a young person with little or no bills to pay my advice would be to throw as much extra cash you have into your investment account. Say your 18/19 with a part time job (assuming your in school) GROW YOUR MONEY. I am 100% not saying gamble in stocks like GME, AMC, etc. but really invest your money in strong fundamentally stable stocks, or ETF’s if you want to play it more safe, because in the next 3, 4, 5 years of your life your not going to have that money to play with. Bills will eventually start to pile up so get started sooner then later! If you are this audience you really have an amazing opportunity that most people don’t have, you have the ability to a leg up over the next person in regards to your finances, and to jump start the growth of your money substantially."

So my advice is go buy a stock and learn."
03/15/2021,stocks,im 22 and ive been aggressively investing. No bills at all and insanely frugal lifestyle left with me with lots of room to throw money at stocks.

03/15/2021,stocks,I think its fine to have a small depot for the fun stuff. I have like 10% in my fun portfolio for buying risky stocks. Its great for learning and way more fun than investing in like etfs. But still do 90% go in etfs. Its way better in the long-run.

03/15/2021,stocks,"100% this. My first job was in NYC making 35k a year. Most of my $$ went to rent, but I had a 401k match and I took advantage. Even though I was making so little, I put pre-tax $$ into that account. I left that job with about 5K in there never touched it and now there is about 45k in the account. It’s not huge and won’t sustain me for the rest of my retirement, but that little account keeps growing and growing and I keep it separate to remind myself of the importance of investing even when it’s just a tiny little amount."
03/15/2021,stocks,But make sure to learn about taxes. It’ll be worth it. How to legally find ways to pay less tax is a skill to have for life.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I appreciate this post, and I second it! As a 21-year-old who started investing right when the pandemic hit, I've been investing consistently over the past year. Because of this, my account has grown almost 40%!  I'm not a financial expert, however, in my opinion, investing my extra money is better than letting it sit in a bank account. Also, it's more tempting to spend my money on useless things when it's readily available, rather than in multiple investments. Investing has made me more frugal (in a good way) and more money! I would recommend it to anyone who is sitting on the fence waiting to jump in, you’re never too young to start! (Unless you’re under 18, then that’s too young… sorry!)"
03/15/2021,stocks,I recommend talking to a real financial adviser before you do this or tie up all of your funds.
03/15/2021,stocks,"When it comes to finances, people can't tell you how to invest in the end. You have to figure out what works best for you on your own. Everyone has their own timeframes, their own ideas, and their own strategies. This insight is something I had to discover myself and from what I've observed about the modern market. (Not financial advice.) Throwing money into value traps and ETFs isn't going to cut it anymore these days."

03/15/2021,stocks,"I disagree personally but to each their own. At that age I was already living on my own for a few years, however if I would have had the safety net I recommend to fckn YOLO. Not just in stocks,, but in anything. Take the risks. Youre already poor. You have no children to worry about, and nothings guaranteed.

Realisticlly knowing myself back then I wouldn't have listened to this advice as I was in too precarious a situation to have taken risks but I wish I did when I started to financially stabilize. I had opportunities but chose to play it safe, significantly slowing my progress. 

Knowing what I know now, life is so much shorter than u realize and the system is set up for you to struggle. Only when you take risks (which can often lead to more struggling, but keep going) do you ever actually get to the point of true financial stability (different for everyone) and you're young. Take them risks and fckn go for gold. Wcs, you're just as poor as you would have been anyways"

03/15/2021,stocks,"A few notes.

I agree - start early in good fundamentals or ETFs.

I disagree - why wouldn't they have that money to play with?  Income will go up over time and unless you're going into debt (why would you do this? live within your means) you should always be able to set aside a set % of income for investments and your future.

The problem you outlined is indicative of someone increasing their spending more than their earnings.  Yes, it's common -- but the genuine advice is don't go into debt on depreciating assets (e.g., a car), don't buy more house than you can afford and ensure you can invest ~25% of your income.  If you can manage those 3 rules you'll do just fine, imho."

Just find a company you truly believe in and hold onto your shares like an investment for several years. Dividend investing is really good to get into early on as well!

03/15/2021,stocks,"I don’t see any advantage in it if I want to retire early (~40) and want to be able to withdraw at that age. Can someone tell me if I’m wrong? As far as I know, you can only take out contributions tax free before 60."
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you don't even have enough for your emergency fund because you just finished high school and have a part time job, I don't know if locking your money up for decades is the best move."
03/15/2021,stocks,Spot on. You should only be contributing to a personal brokerage account after you've maxed your Roth IRA for the year (unless you are investing for some expense before retirement).
03/15/2021,stocks,the idea is max ROTH then make a brokerage account
03/15/2021,stocks,"Solution. 

Be poor = pay less taxes"
03/15/2021,stocks,Can I open a Roth IRA in one company (ie Vanguard) if I already buy stocks with a different one? Is it easier/smarter to consolidate them?
03/15/2021,stocks,"When I put money into a Roth IRA, what should I invest in? I’ve been told a 2060 index fund is the way to go if you’re younger. Do you know if this is true?"
03/15/2021,stocks,What is cheapest app that’s credible for putting a small amount into your brokerage account every month? I see a new app every day
03/15/2021,stocks,Do you have to pay taxes if you lost money?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Isn’t it more like accumulated profits for the year minus accumulated losses? That end of the year profit is what’s taxable.

You don’t pay taxes on sales you make and then reinvest and lose more than you started with, for example. Otherwise day traders would constantly be getting screwed?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"agreed, but betterment individual taxable is actually quite good"
03/15/2021,stocks,What is the equivalent of that in Ireland? I’m 19 and don’t really know what to invest in
03/15/2021,stocks,i started a roth in 2015 when i was a freshman in college and working a real taxable job. I had 6K in it then and sadly i just let it sit. I started actually focusing on it during the pandemic and im at $30k now.
03/15/2021,stocks,Or a regular ira and get tax money back
03/15/2021,stocks,Tfsa
03/15/2021,stocks,Note: Dont use a Roth/any retirement accounts if you plan to FIRE with the obvious exception of contributing the 401k match %
03/15/2021,stocks,"I max out contributions to my ROTH IRA, 401k, and HSA spending account. Anyone know if there any other ways to save/invest money tax free?"
03/15/2021,stocks,Is ROTH IRA basically an American Version of Canadas TFSA?
03/15/2021,stocks,If I want to liquidate some of my assets in a Roth IRA like say to pay for home renovations or a big vacation what is the penalty. It’s not clear to me what the difference is between the IRA and my 401k is in terms of its usability pre-retirement.
03/15/2021,stocks,we want money now not when we are retired
03/15/2021,stocks,"I would add to this. Do a backdoor roth ira. In the event that you get lucky and make a good amount of money, you will still qualify."
03/15/2021,stocks,I had gotten some money a couple of years ago. Took it to a bank and asked about a Roth IRA.  They told me I could only put like I think 7k a year in it. Anyway I felt they steered me away from it. Is that true?
03/15/2021,stocks,Hijacking the top comment to say if you’re in the UK do as much of your trading/ investing through a Stocks & Shares ISA. You can protect your gains from tax with very few drawbacks.
03/15/2021,stocks,Retirement. A bit early no? I'd wait till I'm working full time to even start worrying about putting money away for retirement.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I wouldn’t recommend a Roth to a 18 year old, becuz of the restrictions to the money. At 18 they will still need money to pay for living expenses/college and can be more beneficial to them now. They can always start a Roth at 20 and be just fine and know they won’t need that cash anytime soon."

03/15/2021,stocks,If everyone is literate no one is literate
03/15/2021,stocks,"Same!! Win some lose some, but always learning! I’m currently up 22%, and after surviving that “crash” from 1/2 weeks ago, nothing can stop me now. This is the time to grow! (23yo)"
03/15/2021,stocks,"You're doing great right now, but learn to enjoy some of that money later in life."
03/15/2021,stocks,I mean everyone is up for the most part.
03/15/2021,stocks,My emergency fund at 18/19 was if my I had at least $5 to withdraw from the atm.🤣
03/15/2021,stocks,Which most definitely will if you've never invested before.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah 💯 that's what iam trying to do right now build a  emergency fund while also contributing to my investing account


Iam 18"
03/15/2021,stocks,At 18 your emergency fund should be friends and family tbh
03/15/2021,stocks,What's ROTH
03/15/2021,stocks,">Is this a good place to start?

As you said, it depends on your lifestyle. Can you afford to live w/o 10%?

I'm not young, but I invest nearly all of my check bc I have very few bills."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm new, with like 2 responsibilities and I try to put 50-75 % of my income into investing. About 10% of that goes into swing trading."
03/15/2021,stocks,90% for me but I don’t make shit lol. I just kept 25-30k in the market and like 3k in traditional bank accounts.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'd suggest starting really high, like 50% plus and then adjusting down if you need it. Better to plan your life around a lower income than to let lifestyle creep eat up what you could be saving / investing.

I wish I had done that when I was younger, I started around 10%, but am now saving about 65%-70%"
03/15/2021,stocks,10% will get you no where. That's the cold hard truth. 10% is better than 0 but 10% is still nothing when it comes to being wealthy

03/15/2021,stocks,This is the way
03/15/2021,stocks,I think NKLA is set for a comeback lol
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you had saved just $10 a week, you'd have $5,200 today.

I'm sorry, but we have enough ppl who make their situations even worse by not saving bc they figure it's not worth it. I can't get on board with the ""your life's already fucked, so just spend it all"" mentality. lol Sure, have some fun, but you should certainly think about saving for your future.

&#x200B;

Edit: Math lol"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah this. There was a period of time when I had 20 cents in my bank account. It taught me a number of lessons, but having even less money due to putting a measly amount into stocks not only would have made it that much harder, I almost definitely would have sold it all most likely at a loss just because I needed the money.

I always advocate for only investing in things you understand; if you don’t understand what you’re doing in the market it’s really easy to get lost. If I saw gains at 18, I probably would’ve YOLO’d my life savings expecting some repeatable event and crashed out and lost a heap of money.

I would however say that if there’s something you believe in for the long haul and you have a bit of money available - invest and then pretend you never had that money in the first place. Over 10 years that can be huge.

$1k in Apple or Microsoft 10 years ago... 

But hindsight is easy. Picking a longevity stock and parting with the cash at 18 is whole ‘nother thing."
03/15/2021,stocks,"This is the worst advice ever


1 year ago I started really saving,as i had only about 7K(I was 21).

Now I'm 22 with 42K


You don't need to just blow your money

Things are hard, so you just give up? Pathetic"
03/15/2021,stocks,100% agree.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I second this. I didn't live. My parents taught me to work hard always, and that's what I did. I missed out on learning social skills and just being present. I had to teach myself those things in my 20s and it was difficult."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I’m going to add a different perspective to this.

I graduated from college in 2019, so I’m almost 24 now. Personally I think the “spend your money and have fun in college” idea is way *overrated*.

I took grants and loans for my tuition (I live in Ontario, Canada so it’s called OSAP here). I was given a certain amount I wouldn’t have to pay back since I was an independent student living on my own, and then had about $15,000 in loans total over 4 years (that I wouldn’t have to start paying back until 6 months after I graduated). Besides this I had some money my parents saved up for me as well.

I *could* have just said fuck it and spent all my money on whatever I wanted, whether that money was from the jobs I had or the spare funds from my parents.

But instead almost all the extra money I made went straight into investments and my tax free savings account, and grew a lot over the span of 4 years. By the time I graduated I had enough money to pay off my loan when the time came.

So idk about you, but being 22 and debt free, with money still invested and constantly growing, felt way better than all the little fun things I could have done while a stupid 18/19 year old. I got my first full time job before the pandemic started and continued investing money during the crash too.

I fully believe I would much rather be a successful rich 30 year old with the spare money available to travel around the world for a whole year, than a broke 19 year old that just spent my last $20 getting drunk at a trashy bar.

Life is much better in your 20s/30s than during your college years, in my opinion, so why waste your money when you could be investing it towards the best years of your life? And then beyond that as well."
03/15/2021,stocks,What exactly is a ROTH IRA account? Why would i go with this if i can just go with a brokerage account?
03/15/2021,stocks,What is Roth IRA equivalent in Ireland?
03/15/2021,stocks,Me too!!
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah, It's hard to take advice seriously from someone who doesn't distinguish between ""your"" and ""you're""."
03/15/2021,stocks,Boo! Your not even giving advice
03/15/2021,stocks,"Ikr, almost stop reading after the first sentence."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Ouch. That's anger inducing to hear and something that absolutely needs to change with regards to education publicly and in our schools. I was lucky I had a roommate after college with a wealthier background to introduce me to investing. Otherwise, I'd probably have a lot more sports cars as my savings..."
03/15/2021,stocks,OTM weeklies
03/15/2021,stocks,"Realistically, do some googling and zero in on some goals. And also be realistic in how much time and energy you want to put in.  

*1) My personal non-professional advice for someone with 20k would be to open a Roth IRA *today* with a company that offers fractional shares (or not, but it's nice to have options).  
*2) Put the max amount of money in for 2020 and also 2021 (~12k). *Also today*   
*3) Google how to evaluate stocks, I personally recommend reading some books--do you own research. *about a month*  
*4) Then invest in things you feel confident about, with your base of knowledge.  *Forever*

Do your own research, be wary of paralysis through analysis *bad* and time in the market beats timing the market *good*.

03/15/2021,stocks,Stonks!
03/15/2021,stocks,Open an account with Schwab or Vanguard. They will give you a free consultation and talk you through your situation and goals. Open a ROTH IRA and max it for the year ($6k) and plan how you will continue to contribute to it. Tax-sheltered accounts come first (like the Roth). Then you’ll have some left for a few months emergency savings and if you want to trade in a brokerage account or grow them in safer index funds or ETFs. It’s not working for you and growing if it’s sitting around and $20k is a great amount.
03/15/2021,stocks,I'm pretty much in the same position as you. What I did was 15k on VOO and add to that weekly and put 5k in a active fund that you play with.
03/15/2021,stocks,This actually is not true. Dollar cost averaging may feel safer or more profitable but it actually is not. Research shows that lump sum investing is more profitable about 66% of the time. Both strategies work in the long run but there is an advantage to lump sum investing
03/15/2021,stocks,or the bottom of something
03/15/2021,stocks,"That's a great return on investment! I would setup a system that forces yourself to take a certain amount of profits so that you can remove emotion from the equation. Pre-trading interference I was convinced it would go to at least 700-900 range. Now, I'm not so sure it can make it above the 350 level again. Risk/reward doesn't look great right now. Good luck!"
03/15/2021,stocks,"The key is paying bills first, especially CC bills. 
My opinion is if you have credit card debt, you should pay that before investing anything."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yet etfs were ok for the last 100 years, but magically it isnt going to cut it now? Has the compound interest formula changed?"
03/15/2021,stocks,I 99% disagree with this (we agree on your/you’re)
03/15/2021,stocks,Nothing else gives a yield. What are people going to do after selling their stocks?
03/15/2021,stocks,because it had a few green days amid market turmoil doesn't make it a strong fundamentally stable stock.
03/15/2021,stocks,It could all end in an instant if the mood swings good way to not sleep for weeks.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Agree. We don’t want to teach teenagers to gamble which can be easily picked at that age. Investing is good, but only invest 50% or less portion of your savings until you are adult and finally understand about risks like behavior change according to market, sitting and watching stocks all day while neglecting your or family life,depression and much more. I think teenagers are more vulnerable to these than adults when investing."
03/15/2021,stocks,Your boos mean nothing! I've lost enough in stocks to know that I wish I would have invested in myself more when I was young and unbound. It's a bad Idea to have ANY percent of your wealth RELY on stock investments.

03/15/2021,stocks,Can’t pay capital gains if no gains. [taps forehead]
03/15/2021,stocks,"You can withdraw contributions at any time for any reason with no penalty. Then gains are tax free at 60, or taxable before then."
03/15/2021,stocks,you can withdraw contributions after 5 years. So max it out now and you can pull it before you turn 60. However you can’t withdraw your gains
03/15/2021,stocks,"I am just curious as to how much money you have determined that you need to retire at 40?  A Roth is a good idea for a source of tax free income, but the advantage really doesn't hit until 59.5 years old.  The limited amount you can put into IRA's make them less ideal if you are counting them as your major investment vehicle to retirement, so most people use them as a secondary retirement fund.  Other sources of retirement like a 401k allow you to put considerable more money into them, but you can be limited on investments depending on who runs it for your employer.  Another overlooked place to park your money is into an HSA if you have a high deductible insurance plan.  Tax free all around if you are paying for medical things."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes, you should be using it as long as you plan to live to 60. It shouldn’t be your only account but that’s always true since the limit is fairly small."
03/15/2021,stocks,"You definitely want both. We're about 50/50 between individual investments and retirement accounts with 20-25% of retirement accounts in Roth. Should give extremely good flexibility for managing tax bills in the future. As for what age to retire? Who knows, maybe take a few years off working again before my girls are school age and do that a few more times before I hit retirement age."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Everyone wants to retire early but the reality is that very few people get that lucky or that good at their job to do so. 

Plus, if you truly get to that point when you are making millions, then you don't really need the roth ira money to fund you lifestyle for the next 25 years."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think retirement at 40 is out of the question, healthcare costs will make that impossible.  Unless someone has $millions saved, there is no way the money will last for the rest of thier lives.  Most 40 year olds still have a house note and are saving for their own kid's college not to mention this whole loan forgiveness bs is because the college kids today are claiming they'll be paying for college into their 40's."
03/15/2021,stocks,"You can pull your contributions from a Roth at any time. Personally I use my Roth *as* my emergency fund right now.

Worst case, I need to pull everything out at some point. Best case is I won't need that money and it won't just be wasting away for years in a shitty savings account ""just in case."" I'm taking a slight gamble that it won't lose value in that time, but the risk is more than worth it to me."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I dollar cost average into my roth ira. I do $250 every 2 weeks. Then the rest into my brokerage.

Does that make any difference or should I still be putting 6k first before touching my brokerage?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Is it worth it to have a Roth IRA separate from a Roth 401k? If so, how much do you recommend contributing to each? I have a Roth IRA because I didn't have enough money in my 401k to keep the account open after my first internship ended. Now I have a 401k and an IRA but I only contribute 10% of my paycheck to the 401k (employer matches up to 6%.) Should I only put 6% into the 401k and put the rest into the IRA?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Better advice, get as much money as possible."
03/15/2021,stocks,But also be rich = pay less taxes
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yep, you can have accounts at different brokerages just like you can have more than one bank account. I would recommend keeping them in the same place for simplicity. Makes things like Roth IRA conversion easier than interbank transfers, and easier to keep track of."
03/15/2021,stocks,2060 index fund is a safe bet
03/15/2021,stocks,Fidelity. Been around for decades
03/15/2021,stocks,"Not if you lost more money than you gained, no. You can actually save money from that by making your losses tax deductible."
03/15/2021,stocks,"This is a phenomenal amount to have in a retirement fund at your age. You're probably ahead of like 90% of people your age.

I wish I'd had any advice about this at all when I was that young. I'm trying to play catch-up so I can ""early retire"" by 60 instead of 65, hah."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Unless you know with some degree of certainty that you will be dead by 59.5 years old, you still should use a Roth IRA and (Roth)  401k."
03/15/2021,stocks,Can I ask why you don't want a Roth IRA if you plan to FIRE?
03/15/2021,stocks,Can you start a 1099 business?
03/15/2021,stocks,No. Never too early
03/15/2021,stocks,"Think of it as paying yourself now. If you put in the max for an IRA as soon as you turn 18 then keep doing that every year till you're 27 and stop, you should have around 1m by the time you're 65. Obv youll have more if you keep doing it after you turn 27, but itll have less impact since its compounding and more time in= more money out."
03/15/2021,stocks,Earlier you start it the better
03/15/2021,stocks,It's never to early.
03/15/2021,stocks,That shit saved my ass during the pandemic. You have no idea what pulling that money out did for me.
03/15/2021,stocks,I started investing for retirement when I was 16
03/15/2021,stocks,"It all depends. Are you planning on working somewhere or starting businesses  if you're starting businesses you're gonna want that money liquid. Also keep in mind you have a high likelihood of going bankrupt, which is a part of risking it all for glory. Most never make it to glory though. 

If you're planning on working a job when you're older than planning for retirement at 60 is likely the better choice. Its all based on how willing you are to sleep in a car for a few years and be broke af like I was for quite a long time. Luckily I met the most amazing woman in the world who helped keep me solvent while I built my business up (altho we almost went under last year due to covid and still haven't properly recovered from the leverage we took on, but thays part of the risks)"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Think about it like this, most people think about retirement way too late and start investing at age 35 (making this up). An 18 year old who just turned 18 is already investing both into Roth and his own brokerage account. Assuming both people consistently start funding their accounts, the 18 year old has 17 years of mor growth potential than the 35 year old. Assuming 7% annually you can do the math when it's compounded in the Roth ira"
03/15/2021,stocks,No. Rich people start roth ira super early. I already started one for my son and he's not even 1 year old
03/15/2021,stocks,"Whatever money an 18 year old can save by working won't even put a scratch in a typical college tuition. You're either going to be a)broke and in debt, or b)broke and in debt but with a Roth IRA."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Bruh last month was a disaster but it's not the worst. When interest rates hike, NASDAQ probably gonna see another -20% and that's when we talk about a real crash. Stocks can go down 60% from ATH into oversold territory very easily especially if it's highly speculative ones. Even good growth stocks are also seeing that kinda dips nowadays."
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah for sure
03/15/2021,stocks,"Wasn't bragging, just relaying the info. The point is, investing sooner rather than later is usually a good idea. At the start I was wondering when and where I should enter stocks, and I heard the quote ""the best day to start investing is tomorrow, and the day after that"" so I just got what I wanted and sat back."
03/15/2021,stocks,Are there even ATMs that allow $5 withdrawals?
03/15/2021,stocks,My emergency fund in college was a credit card or some loans. lol

03/15/2021,stocks,10% is a great start tbh and then they can advance to 20 or more after learning more
03/15/2021,stocks,^
03/15/2021,stocks,10% of 1000 is 100. 10% of 10000 is 1000. Even if the guy makes minimum wage hes still gonna benefit greatly from compounding over 30-40 years.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the downvotes. Do me a favour,  put 10% of your salary in a compound interest calculator at 7% interest for 40 years...yep... youll be apartment poor (you couldnt afford a house with that money in 40 years) at 60-70 years old relying on pension (if it exists by then)"
03/15/2021,stocks,why would they be?
03/15/2021,stocks,I hope not. That was my get rich stock choice. Put double my usual into it at its ATH of $65 😅
03/15/2021,stocks,"I run into this mindset (spend it all now) a lot when I tell people they should have 6-12 months worth of pay saved up.  The common response is that some people don't make much money and can't save.

My response is that 6-12 months worth of pay for someone that ""does not make much money"" is....not much money.

Sacrificing, to have a stable future is an ""opportunity cost.""  Attending college...time away from family, the money spent.  It's all the cost of a better/more table future.  Same with putting money aside now...saving."
03/15/2021,stocks,"There's a slight balance imo. Ya shouldn't have fckn nothing, maybe like 1k set aside, but 5k is soooo much easier to get when you're older than younger, its really pennies.

No sense in scrounging up and working your ass off (like I did).to build up to 5/10/20k whatever in your 20s and save that. Live life, start a business, or learn a super valuable skill, and fck being a wage slave and never having fun. Live the life. My biggest regret is wage cckn as a GM of a restaurant in my early 20s. I make 50k/yr which was great for thay age but I pissed my life away for pennies, when all it took was time and some gambles to get in a significantly better position.

 I also was significantly happier when I left that life and became a poor degenerate gambler..I lost most of the time but eventually one if my ideas paid off..im.not rich at all but im comfortable and most importantly moderately happy (uncontrollable outside events effect that of course)"
03/15/2021,stocks,Youre forgetting this is a once in a lifetime and likely unrepeatable bull market. We're all very unlikely to routinely see these types of gains again
03/15/2021,stocks,"It's basically a brokerage account, but any stocks you sell you don't get taxed on for the profits. You can only contribute 6k a year though (7k for 55+ people I think). Right now with a brokerage account, if you sell a stock and make profit, the governments cut is typically 15-25% of that profit."
03/15/2021,stocks,"You want it all. Brokerage, traditional, and ROTH. Everything in stocks. All of the above will give you maximum flexibility for gaming the tax code at all points of life. And a tip to get started: long term capital gains can often be cashed out at a zero percent tax rate if you can get under the 15% (now 12%) tax bracket. So... An example: If you make a lot more than that and have a significant amount of capital gains to cash out, can be a good time to take a year off from working to travel and enjoy life."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Interestingly my parents were/are pretty well off, but neither come from money and their wealth is derived from my dad's business so although he ""invested"" his money, he invested it into his business and not the stock market so the stock market was not something that really ever was a thing in my house. I think its a lot different now for younger people with all the trading apps so its a lot easier to get exposed to the market at younger ages now. But I agree it would have been great if there was a class in high school, or even just someone who would have showed me some sample numbers of what my portfolio could conservatively look like when I was in my 30s/40s if I was investing $X per month into a relatively safe investment vs. just having my cash sitting in a bank account collecting dust making essentially no interest."
03/15/2021,stocks,"They don’t talk about profitability tho. There is an advantage to lump sum investing in that the profits may be higher but there’s also an advantage in dollar cost averaging in that it mitigates some of the risk, which is kinda the point of it."
03/15/2021,stocks,True it's becoming hard to justify holding it since today it fell to 40k so already almost half my profit gone. I'm probably emotionally holding onto a thought that it will go above 470 to drown out regrets of not selling it then.

03/15/2021,stocks,I can think of hundreds of better uses for excess funds in regards to young adults. I wish I prepared myself to own a business and properties before I went and threw away money in the stock market.
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you had invested in any of the blue chip stocks when you were “young” (I’m going to assume 20-30 years) then today you would be retired and working towards being wealthy.  If you lost in stocks it’s because you sold on market corrections, crashes, bought high sold low, yolo invested in shit companies and didnt do any DD on your portfolio.

If I invested when I was his age 20 years ago (instead of spending it on stupid shit) in blue chip stocks and didnt touch any of the money I invested monthly, then today I’d have millions of dollars and be retiring at 38 years old.  Just because YOU made poor decisions/mistakes doesnt invalidate any of the advice given here.  

This is the age where he SHOULD be investing in stocks.  As long as he does his DD and lowers his risk profile by picking blue chip stocks.  

Don’t project your shitty past on someone who is asking for stock advice, you couldve said, “These were the mistakes I made when I invested in stocks when I was young, don’t do this.” and you wouldve been well received.

To the thread OP: My biggest mistake in my younger years was not investing in the stock market, don’t be like me and certainly don’t be like this fucking clown.  And you can do both, set aside 15% of your pay in an IRA or 401k AND put extra money into the stock market.

Best tip I can give, once a paycheck buy one stock if that is all you can afford and if it’s a blue chip you can set it and forget it.  As your income goes up buy 2x shares, 3x shares, 4x shares a paycheck (depending on the stock).  By the time youre 40 you’ll be ready for retirement."
03/15/2021,stocks,"that’s just your fault tbh. It’s technically impossible to lose in the stock market if you put your money into a S&P and don’t be dumb lol

Should probably edit your comment so it doesn't mislead people."
03/15/2021,stocks,So what’s the point of it if I want to retire early? Am I better off just using a regular account if that’s my plan?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Do you mean w/draw w/o penalty? I'm being lazy here. Please help me out. If I know that I'll w/draw after 5 yrs, am I saving money by putting it in a Roth to begin with? Thinking this through right now. Even if I have to pay taxes on it, I'm delaying paying the tax...but I still don't have access to those funds right now. Can't see the benefit for my scenario."
03/15/2021,stocks,Good point!
03/15/2021,stocks,"It’s not that farfetched given you have favorable circumstances. My FIRE number would be $2.5m, and that’s reachable if I invest $5000/month for ~18 years with a ~7% return rate.

03/15/2021,stocks,"I’m not sure how possible it is for the average American, I’m going to assume not possible at all. But if you have favorable circumstances like a house being bought for you or married with both having a high income, then it’s definitely possible to retire early.

03/15/2021,stocks,">	You can pull your contributions from a Roth at any time.

Pretty sure that you need to have your Roth for 5 years before you can withdraw your contributions w/o a tax consequence. At that point you can freely withdraw all principal as long as you leave the profits on the Roth.

Edit: thanks all, this is incorrect. See below!"
03/15/2021,stocks,just max out your roth first tbh in that case. Just because more likely over the year of averaging your stocks can go up pretty high and you can’t move them from brokerage to roth after
03/15/2021,stocks,Max your Roth 1st. 100%
03/15/2021,stocks,almost always I would max your Roth IRA first because of the tax benefits. The only instance I would say otherwise is if you are investing money that you plan to use well before retirement. Say for a wedding in a few years or sending a kid to college. But as far as investing for the later stage of your life max the Roth IRA first. Personal brokerage comes after that.
03/15/2021,stocks,Just drop the 6k into your Roth. You're timing the market.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Its so hard effectively putting away $500 a month right now (responsibility wise) when all my friends are dropping money on guns, motorcycles and fun toys. Thank you This is comforting to hear, I know 100000% itll be worth it later on. But my friends and I are all engineers fresh out of college when the pandemic started. I don't know how some people have done it (maybe with help) but they've bought houses within a year of graduating college with me. Being responsible when everyone else is more care free, is hard. But like i said, im in for the long game.

most of the growth was from some early pre split tesla stocks and then  the last 30% was from a very conservative GME play, i never lost a penny in GME, but It was too much stress. i got out when i was up 400%. couldve made more, but i wanted to lock it in, i dont regret it. Fast growth is amazing, but i dont have the stomach for that kind of gambling, so i went back to traditional safer stocks."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Its technically WAY more efficient

I was sloppy with my words. I should have said, if you want to be rich by 40 and want to enjoy it before you turn 60, consider not putting everything in inaccessible retirement accts. I use a Roth myself because its part of my 401 match, but I want my gains to be accessible"
03/15/2021,stocks,But I barely have any money. I'm not even doing long term investments cuz I'm gna need the money most likely in the next year
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah but they are still gonna need money for car expenses, food, insurances, phone, books, utilities and other random shit. Telling an 18 year old to put their money in an account they can’t really access (w/o penalties) until 59 isn’t a wise financial decision. Especially if your best argument is they are gonna be so fucked from college expenses it’s not worth even touching the money?? Like a broke college student isn’t gonna be tempted by cash sitting there when they need money for food. 

I’m all for starting a Roth early but not everyone needs to start at 18, they still have plenty of time to start saving early and need the cash for other things more immediate."

03/15/2021,stocks,"I understand exactly what you mean and I agree with you. Pinching pennies from 20-25 to only save up as much as you make in a single month at your first full-time job is kind of pointless. You should save money of course and not waste it on useless stuff, but don't deny parties/fun dinners out with friends just to get a few dollars more in your savings account. You will regret it later. 

Let's say you have a part-time job while studying and make 60 bucks a week.

If you go to 1 party every week and spend around 20 bucks on beer and fun, it's only 5200 bucks over 5 years.

Would you rather have 10k in your saving at 25 and having gone to a lot of fun parties, or would you have 15k in your savings at 25 and never having gone out and done fun stuff? In practice, the 5k extra really doesn't make a difference when you get your first full-time job, especially compared to the amount of extra fun you had during those 5 years.

Edit: Ask any 30 year old if they would spend 5k to have as much fun as you would have had during those 5 years. I can guarantee 99% of people would instantly say yes. People easily spend 1k for just a weekend of fun traveling, imagine how much 5 years of fun is worth to them."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Only $5K of that $42K is gains from stocks


You're missing the point entirely

You just shouldn't save or invest because it's ""too little""gains or you aren't able to save thousands/ month?

Like give me a break🤣"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I see, but ive heard you can only sell your stocks/ cash in your profits after like your 60th birthday, is that correct or can you just cash in anytime you like?"
03/15/2021,stocks,What do you mean by traditional? Isn't a brokerage account the same thing as a traditional one?
03/15/2021,stocks,"I don’t disagree with you. But if you’re investing in for example, a broad market index fund, you don’t really need to worry when lump sum investing. 


But both are valid ways to invest in the market for sure"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Well, the important thing is to get the money into the market. It just feels safer.

You mitigate the risk by forgoing the profits of being fully invested. Since markets generally go up, you're a bit better off investing it all directly. The longer you space out your investment the safer you are, but you also miss out on a longer investment period."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Since I went in way late to the game but before the true frenzy, I had a plan to sell a little each day until I was out and not hold for more than a week. Though I could have had about 25% more gains if I had sold during the trading halt, the strategy worked fine with a 200% gain and kept my emotions from forcing me to hold something I knew was overvalued."
03/15/2021,stocks,We are not talking about if people are a fan of etf or not. Does etf make money in the long run? Yes...
03/15/2021,stocks,"They owned more than 100% of the float because they were SHORTING it. They think it's a dog shit company, hence the high short interest. 

The only reason it went up so much is because of a short squeeze"
03/15/2021,stocks,What about ETF’s?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes, because investing what little expendable money you have into a volatile and ever fluctuating market instead of investing in yourself by saving, where you are literally the only variable when it comes to cash flow, is the most logical choice. Go ahead and invest in stocks, but never more than you are willing to lose and most certainly not to be relied on financially at any point. And I'm the clown."
03/15/2021,stocks,"So...your saying saving as much money as possible, when the age of irresponsibility is at its peak, is bad advice? Can I get that on record?"
03/15/2021,stocks,You're living in a fantasy land if you think the seller will pay for closing costs.
03/15/2021,stocks,"with a Roth IRA, you can withdraw without penalty at anytime as the contributions have already been taxed. You can't write off the contributions yearly is the downside."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm currently taking a 3-pronged approach. I have a brokerage account, which I dabble in the market with, which are mainly long-term bets like Ford, energy and the like. My Roth IRA account  is set up as an ETF in the same brokerage...with moderate risk (they pick the stocks and bonds for me, this account is currently at a 17% return rate); they also put aside 1/3 of your contributions into an interest-bearing account to help smooth out fluctuations in the market. Lastly, I have a higher-risk ETF account that is also managed by the same brokerage, this consists of mostly stock investments (the brokerage states that you could potentially gain 30% or lose 30% of you money in this one on a yearly basis, so I am cautious with my contributions on this one). The beauty of all it all? No commissions on any of the trades. I know, I know, they get to use my money but commissions are why I never really  invested until 2 years ago."
03/15/2021,stocks,"6k/yr of investable money that can grow tax free if you wait to use it. So worst case scenario is you pay taxes on it like you would anyway. Best case, you get by with other funds until 60 and then start using the Roth.

The reality may very well be somewhere in between, but there is still some advantage to it."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I really recommend having both. For me my FIRE goals are that i’ll continue working after i’m 40 just as a more fulfilling job like a teacher or really whatever i decide then. To simply retire early is possible but you’d have to have a lot of money invested and in my opinion I should max out my roth so that I can pull it out essentially tax free later on. So i’ll save money when i turn 40 that’ll last me till i’m 60. Then I have a whole new amount of money that’s essentially tax free and can be possibly 2 mil to fully retire. 

let me know if i make any sense or for further questions as I’m a dumbass and can’t write very well"
03/15/2021,stocks,"on the IRA...do you plan on living past 60? retirement doesnt mean pulling all of your money out of investments and sleeping on top of it. Likely a lot of it sits in the same investment vehicles it has been in the whole time.

that being said, by your comments on retiring at 40 i'm assuming you're around 18-24 max...awesome you're thinking about this stuff already. BUT, if you're serious about retiring at 40, you need to invest some serious effort in the ""financial freedom"" mindset AKA spend absolutely no money on anything that is not absolutely essential. Real investing is NOT a means to make millions of dollars in 10years without a HUGE amount of luck. you can definitely do it but you're going to need to think about saving waaaaay more than what to invest in, that should be the easy part. Just go vangaurd500, re-use cloth diapers when you have kids, and pump ever single cent you can into savings. 

i'll be working 60 hours a week until 2055."
03/15/2021,stocks,If you want to retire early Real estate is the best way. But its a job not passive income
03/15/2021,stocks,"okay so i’m a little confused on the question but so for roth ira you pay the taxes now before you invest that money in a roth ira account. Max amount to invest per year now is 6000. 
Let’s say i invest 6000 now while i am 20 and would like to pull it out when i’m 40. Hypothetically let’s say that became 7000 (i’m just pulling a number out of my ass.) I can withdraw that 6000 i invested in the beginning but must leave that 1000 gain in the roth until i’m either 60 or i would like to pull it with penalty. If you wait until your 60 your gains aren’t taxed at all. 

Personally I’m maxing out my roth then investing in an extra brokerage account for my FIRE goals. So i’d invest around 1000 a month in that brokerage. I would really recommend this unless you’re young like me, don’t have a job that has a 401k, and need to pay off debt or education expenses. I make roughly 2000 a month and have no living expenses so I save half my money for school and fun."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I can retire early if I want. But even then, I won't touch my roth ira until 59. Once you start making 200k+, taxes are the worst enemy so maximize any tax savings account possible."
03/15/2021,stocks,I'm not moving and am certianly way past my 40's and my 19 year old isn't moving either.  Cheat code or not.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Because for a lot of people an emergency like losing their job will coincide with markets being down. That makes it the absolute worst time to pull out money. Also, once you pull it out of your IRA, you can't replenish that money. If you had to pull out money from your IRA last March, you'd have pulled it out when most things were about 50-60% of their February value. You'd have also missed out on the massive gains that stuff could have generated in 2020.  

&#x200B;

My emergency fund is all cash and then I keep extra cash on hand to buy the dips."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I wonder the same thing. I think some people just aren't willing to accept any risk with their emergency fund, or maybe have existing positions in their roth that they wouldn't be willing to liquidate if necessary.

For me VTI and chill is better than any savings account, especially when the odds of me using that money are relatively low by definition."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm talking specifically about contributions. In a Roth, you've already paid taxes on those so they aren't taxed again, and it's just a feature of the Roth account that you can withdraw your contributions without penalty.

Earnings would be taxed and penalized (there are some exceptions) if withdrawn before 60."
03/15/2021,stocks,That is incorrect. The 5 year rule is for withdrawing earnings after 59.5
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think that still only applies to earnings. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong but I'm almost positive contributions can be taken out at any time for any reason.

https://www.fool.com/retirement/plans/roth-ira/5-year-rule/"
03/15/2021,stocks,well i'm 28 so that's why it's hard to drop 6k in at once into my roth when I know I won't be seeing that money for like 40 years. I max it out by the end of the year anyway

03/15/2021,stocks,">they've bought houses within a year of graduating college with me.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Ok, but you still have to pay for rent and ramen noodles after 60 and social security ain't gonna cover it."
03/15/2021,stocks,Then it's better off staying liquid. I have a friend who has $400 to his name and I told him the same thing. No point in locking up that money in the markets for minimal gains unless you're going all in on some penny stock
03/15/2021,stocks,"The point is that college is going to be funded by debt, or daddy's checkbook. No one is paying their way through college by working at McDonald's 20 hours a week. If you really have 20 hours free it is better to take more course load and graduate earlier.

If you can't cover what you need with student loans and you don't have any kind of safety net, probably you need to reevaluate the college thing, and $5000 you earned in HS isn't going to make the decision one way or the other."
03/15/2021,stocks,LEAPS just refer to the timeframe. They can still be OTM

You won't get your twenties back so live it up if you have decent income. Build good habits, but money will come. Pregame before going out instead of dropping 200$ every Saturday night at the bar or club. Pool uber with friends. Spent vacations on experiences. Do not chase high end cars or clothes.

You can't get back the week long music festival with your college friends at 23 when everybody's summer aligned. You can't get back the whistler ski trip before your friends dated off. You can always make back an extra grand.

Dropping 1000 on 6 months of weekly improv classes led to more opportunities than had it been invested in a mutual fund. 1000 on consumer goods is stupid... live in a cheaper apartment and drive a used car."
03/15/2021,stocks,"So you saved 30k of your wages at 22? Which depending on your expenses (i mentioned above i was lucky to be around 50k at that age but that was a ton for ppl like me) puts your salary no less than 55k while you live at home or in a super cheap apartment. Or you're selling something or in trouble with the taxman lmao. 

You also have to realize how rare that is. Not sure your specific situation, but if you think all your buddies are making over 50k/yr then you live in some trust fund area lmao and you're out of touch with reality and your advice is irrelevant. Your advice should be towards masses, otherwise label it as trust fund baby advice.and your trying to brag about your wage at a young age which is not guaranteed forever and you'll realize when you have a family how little thay actually is, even tho its already around the USA median.

Most ppl.in their 20s are in school or making $10/hr. I realized how lucky I was at that age to make what I was making, and again, I wish I would have been more aggressive with it earlier as once I changed from saver to aggro it ""eventually"" changed my life for the waayyy better. I had saved up 20k by 22 on wages only (we didn't have robinhood and common acces to stocks 8 years ago, nor was i the type to have invested in them then) and it did me no good, never brought happiness. I still felt poor even tho I knew I had soo much more than all my friends except the few trust funders I knew. 

I hope you realize how lucky you are to not be making $10/hr and I also hope you have fun with it and take risks, bc I'm telling you, once you have a family, its waaayyyy more nerve racking to take a chance thag could leave you bankrupt, but if you' don't, unless super lucky and have connections, which again, are not the norm for the majority of our society,, you'll be a wage slave for life and never see your fam"
03/15/2021,stocks,"You can trade stocks whenever you want, and you can pull out your initial investment tax free at any time, but any gains you made on those trades/stocks will be taxed as income if you pull it out before 60"

It depends if you want to be wealthy.  That is, you have enough money you don't have to work; you can live off of your investments.  It starts with a Roth IRA when you're a teen and maxing it out when you can, then when you've gotten a decent paying job usually after college, you'll want to max out a 401k and IRA (which can be taken out before retirement age).  Once you get a few raises, you'll make even more, will be above the income limit for an IRA and will max out a 401k and put everything you can into a taxable brokerage account.  After 5 to 10 years of work, you'll not need to work any more and can live off of investments.

You want a Roth IRA when you're a teen, due to how taxes are done in the US.  You want an IRA and 401k once you've got a career due to how taxes are handled."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Traditional IRA. All of your contributions are tax free, but you pay taxes on withdrawal. Just like you would use capital gains for income during early retirement, you will want to use Traditional withdrawals for income after age 59.5. The Roth and individual brokerage accounts allow you to alter your taxable income as necessary for optimum tax benefit.  

There are also traditional 401k and Roth 401k that can only be offered by employers and allow much higher contribution limits to max out.

Edit: you will want to adjust Roth and Traditional contributions as necessary depending on how much money you make, expect to make in the future, and expect to need in retirement. If you make too much money, the government will even phase you out from a Roth, which is probably about the right point to be all in on Traditional anyway. 401k's do not have these limits tho, which is a huge bonus for traditional employment (and sucks when you do contract work and can't benefit)"
03/15/2021,stocks,I did also state that everyone else has their own strategies. Not every strategy is effective for everyone. Yet you want to strawman about ETFs. ETFs are not the end all be all and the leveraged ones can blow you up if you're not careful. There are ETFs that are traps as well. Not worth debating if someone wants to throw their entitlement complex into a reddit post and cherrypick instead of keeping an open mind. Good day.

03/15/2021,stocks,"I believe ETFs/Mutual Funds are an older man’s game.  As we get older we reallocate out of risky investments (individual stocks) and smooth them out into ETFs/Mutual Funds.  Stock bets at a younger age should be as aggressive as possible because of your risk/reward ratio.  At 18 if you invest everything you have in Apple ($5,000) and at 19 Technology stocks take a massive dick punch you have decades for the stock to recover and get massive gains, at 60 time is not on your side.  ETFs and Mutual Funds smooth out market corrections and crashes better than individual stocks and spread your risk over dozens of companies/sectors. At 60 your IRA or 401k should have mostly been shifted into Government backed bonds so when you start pulling that money out at 65 youre not impacted by a bear market, a recession, or a market crash when the time comes to actually retire.  This also buys you time for your stock market investments to recover.

If you ladder your investments you reduce your risk.  I also advise buying a starter home and when you can afford to upgrade to do so and them rent that property out and let someone else pay that houses mortgage."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Obviously, every human being needs to have emergency funds, but for every dollar “saved” you are earning negative cash flow as your “savings” don’t keep up with inflation. Your advice is generalizations.  Here let’s give him some full spectrum advice he has probably been able to Google a million fucking times since the internet exists old man even though he came here for stock market advice.

1. Setup an IRA/401k and put away 15% of your pay into that.
2. Have no more than 3-6 months of savings for an emergency fund.
3. Don’t spend money on an expensive car, don’t pickup expensive alcohol/drug/smoking habits, live within your means.
4. Learn the stock market, follow thread OPs advice and ignore the shitposter above me who lost all his money doing stupid shit and follows stock reddits to give trash advice.

Every penny saved in your bank account is a dollar lost in the stock market when invested correctly."
03/15/2021,stocks,Yes.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes, he is saying that and he is 100% correct because if he is investing in the S&P at this age, he is not only saving money but will be making a ton of money in the future.

The S&P had an average 5.6% return in the last 20 years, if he puts all his “savings” in the S&P over 20 years he will have made more money than by saving it under their mattress like you.  If a person invested only in Microsoft 20 years ago till today, they’d have wealth.

If this is your opinion on investing please hit the unfollow button on this sub because you dont belong here."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Just to nitpick - this is true for regular contributions. Anyone using rollovers / backdoor roth contributions, etc do need to keep principal in the account for 5 years even though taxes have been paid (the year of the conversion)."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Just make sure you're not getting killed on expense ratios. Trade commissions are less relevant than that for long term holdings.

I'm also young enough that I wouldn't be interested in 1/3 of my funds being in cash. Fluctuations aren't a big deal when you have time on your side, especially if you're actively contributing."
03/15/2021,stocks,Are you using a single brokerage firm? If so which 1 and why that one? I'm in a research phase. Thank you
03/15/2021,stocks,I think it makes sense. So in this case I’ll use the employer match for retirement accounts and not touch it until 60. Hopefully I won’t have to rely on it and I can just leave it there until I’m that 60.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Hope you/people who do this still get to enjoy your 20s and 30s. You can’t get it back when you’re a little older, a little less fun, a little more tired. Speaking as someone who just turned 40 and got a late start to saving and being smart... I sure lived quite a life in the meantime traveling and having a great time not shackled to work anytime I wasn’t sleeping or eating.
EDIT: I have retirement savings and investments now, and yes I wish I’d started earlier, just saying it’s important to balance what you’re doing with your younger years besides spending every moment grinding."
03/15/2021,stocks,I would never consider it if I wasn’t already lucky enough to be in a situation where it’s possible. I wouldn’t want to retire early if I had to make compromises during my best years of life. My fire number is $2.5m and I think it’s doable given the right circumstances.
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah it’s definitely not for everybody
03/15/2021,stocks,Oh OK. Thanks for the clarification.
03/15/2021,stocks,"oh i didnt know that you can get one with 3% down, thats a terrible deal IMO. Im trying to save at least $40k for a down payment. I dont know how much i want to pay for a house, but thats my goal. If thats 20%, fantastic, if its 30% even better. But i wont consider a house until i have that saved as spare for a house."
03/15/2021,stocks,">So you saved 30k of your wages at 22? Which depending on your expenses (i mentioned above i was lucky to be around 50k at that age but that was a ton for ppl like me) puts your salary no less than 55k while you live at home or in a super cheap apartment. Or you're selling something or in trouble with the taxman lmao. 

I do live at home, while I'm a college student working two jobs. Since OP is a student as well, he is probably in the same situation. So I don't see how he just ""shouldn't save. Not sure why you guys seem so hell bent on making excuses for him not to save.


>You also have to realize how rare that is. Not sure your specific situation, but if you think all your buddies are making over 50k/yr then you live in some trust fund area lmao and you're out of touch with reality and your advice is irrelevant. 


You're right.  Most people I know from high school aren't on their 4th Car(out of choice),have $10K+ of guns/gear,new electronics, etc, because they're too busy not working and/or partying for their snapchat stories. 


>Your advice should be towards masses, otherwise label it as trust fund baby advice.

But my advice is? All I was saying is just because you don't make much,doesn't mean you shouldn't save. If anything, that is a reason to save more. Are you really this butthurt over me saying that the original posters advice was garbage?

>and your trying to brag about your wage at a young age which is not guaranteed forever and you'll realize when you have a family how little thay actually is, even tho its already around the USA median.


Don't plan to have a family, so although I appreciate your half assed attempt at a demeaning insult, it's not going very well, Especially since my income will do nothing but increase over the years so whether or not I have a family wouldn't matter.

>Most ppl.in their 20s are in school or making $10/hr. I realized how lucky I was at that age to make what I was making, and again, I wish I would have been more aggressive with it earlier as once I changed from saver to aggro it ""eventually"" changed my life for the waayyy better. I had saved up 20k by 22 on wages only (we didn't have robinhood and common acces to stocks 8 years ago, nor was i the type to have invested in them then) and it did me no good, never brought happiness. I still felt poor even tho I knew I had soo much more than all my friends except the few trust funders I knew. 


 I'm not sure why you keep bringing up trust funds when everything I have I have earned and worked for.  You seem like youre trying awfully hard to prove something. 

>I hope you realize how lucky you are to not be making $10/hr and I also hope you have fun with it and take risks, bc I'm telling you, once you have a family, its waaayyyy more nerve racking to take a chance thag could leave you bankrupt, but if you' don't, unless super lucky and have connections, which again, are not the norm for the majority of our society,, you'll be a wage slave for life and never see your fam

 I feel like this doesn't need a reply as I pretty much replied to this earlier."
03/15/2021,stocks,So then the only downside to a Roth IRA is that you can't take out your gains after your 60th birthday? Which you wouldn't have been able to do with a brokerage account anyway
03/15/2021,stocks,Alright thank you. Is an IRA limited to a country? I currently live in the Netherlands and would like to move to Sweden next year. Would it be better for me to wait until I'm there or could I just do it right now? Should I look at the tax differences? Are there maybe country bound IRAs?
03/15/2021,stocks,So institutions own over 100% of the available shares. How then are retail still able to buy if institutions own more shares than exist?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Emergency fund? Dude, I'm talking about building a life. If you think that's all saving money is for, so be it. But trying to convince young adults to put all excess money into the stock market is the real shitpost here. Not once did I say don't invest in stocks. What I did say is that it is better to focus on investing in yourself at that age. Telling teenagers with minimum wage jobs, or barely over that, to throw money at the stock market to ensure their future is comical. You really think a the average 20 year old has any idea on how to properly handle stock investments? Encourage them to educate themselves about it, sure. But just telling them to invest without any kind of guidelines is setting them up to be reckless."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm using ALLY invest. I've read a few negative reviews of them, but they've worked well for me for the last 2 years."
03/15/2021,stocks,basically the idea. That way you save more since you’ll pay less in taxes as well as won’t be tempted to use it as early but if you did you’d be able to
03/15/2021,stocks,"One other thing to keep in mind that I didn’t realize until late 20’s....depending on your interests and abilities you can definitely get a job where you make a lot of money but actually enjoy what you do. 
If I won the lottery right now I might take a sabbatical or get a new job but I would never not work, I like what I do too much."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah I got quoted for 3% down on a $250,000 house a $1600 monthly payment. It was horrifying. Mortgage insurance is killer."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Another important point, saving money is about forming a habit. Of course you don't need to save 75% of your paychecks, but definitely save something. Doing so will make future saving/investing so much easier."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Well I'm just warning you, when you turn 30 like me you're gonna regret working your life away... ignore me if you want, I know I would have too (I had plenty ppl warn me). 

Also, dont think your mentality won't change. I wasn't sure about having a family then either, that changed really quick when I met my fiancé. She changed my world view. Go make some memories while you can, im just warning ya.

Also try to become a millionaire with it, take risks, that job will always be there, moreso when you're older.... bc you're going to look back, just like me, and say, well damn, I wish I would have worked less and had more fun (granted I didn't have parents so had to to survive, but I went overboard with working). You're in a very lucky situation to have a family period, not to mention one you can live with. THIS is the time to take risks!! Its only gonna get harder the older you get. But like I said, I never listened to anyone like myself at that age either..."
03/15/2021,stocks,"You know what dude, all those millionaire guys who sac’d their 20’s and now have an everyday lifestyle a 20 something would dream of, they’re wrong. They’re definitely unhappy."
03/15/2021,stocks,"You can take out gains as well, but it'll be taxed as regular income until you're 60+ so you're much better off not withdrawing until at least then. Once you turn 60 you can start pulling from the gains the account has made without a tax burden. There are some exceptions to that, if the money is being used for like medical bills and some other things I believe."
03/15/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/15/2021,stocks,"Save for what?  A down payment on a house?  In 20 years he could afford to buy a house outright, likely multiple houses.  You are projecting your own irresponsibility onto every 20 year old that knows how to navigate the internet, read and absorb information faster than you, know how to use commission free apps like Ameritrade, Robinhood, WeBull and can follow the latest trends on Social Media better than we can.

A teenager is less likely to drop his lifesavings of $1,000 (lol) on a get quick rich scheme than a 40+ year old joining the game late in life who can barely use his smartphone.

Youre advice is trash and my daughter will be investing in the stock market the day she starts earning her own income."
03/15/2021,stocks,"oh my goodness yeah I'm trying to go for about $1000-1200 monthly. A lot of my friends forgot to factor in furniture, repairs, upkeep and all the insurances. They're basically living pretty below where id want to, IMO with like <$250 free a month for fun stuff (eating out, drinking, toys, entertainment). Definitely not how I want to live at least. 

That's what kind of freaks me out, all the little things that add up."
03/15/2021,stocks,Wow. 30 and you worked your life away??  Priceless.   I feel that your older self would appreciate your younger self more if you would have saved more for retirement.  Sounds like you are regretting your decision to have a family more than anything.  Make new memories instead of looking at the past as some glory years.
03/15/2021,stocks,That's what poor people tell themselves to make themselves feel better
03/15/2021,stocks,"Ah i see, thank you!"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Of course institutions are in on this. But when they decide to do a rug pull, I wouldn't want to be left holding the bag. 

GME was maybe fairly valued at $40 a share but at this price, it's wildly overvalued and I think you'd be crazy to see it as a good investment"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I can't figure out what to say to keep you going, but I wish I could. I don't care if you are trolling, just give us more."
03/15/2021,stocks,So which one of your many houses does your daughter live in? Hope the housekeeper of that estate teaches her the importance of investing AND saving.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Does your $1000 per month account for taxes? 

I pay $1000 to the mortgage itself (principal+interest) and still have another $800 go into escrow for school/property tax. I count it all as my mortgage payment, but a lot of people separate the 2. 

And I know when I bought our first house that I didn't realize how much that added on per month."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I worked my youth away for nothing yes. The money got me nothing, it was the knowledge I gained that made me. I achieved all I could from running restaurants but stayed waayyy too long simply for the money. And yes I got an earlier start than most. 

My main regret is that I'd be significantly farther ahead if I got away from the boring saving and working for years instead of taking risks. I was 25 when I started my first business. And altho thats young (im grateful for that) I also look at how much faster I could have achieved where I'm at now, and how much faster I could have gotten to where I want to go.

My first child is on the way so not here yet, can't say for sure if I'll regret it or not. Everyone says ""oh its a blessing"". I think it will be but I can't confirm that yet until I've experienced it. Moreso my regret is that we could be farther along in my current biz, and be working towards my next biz.

My current business definitely provides a service, and we have plans to change the Industry, but they're pretty damn far away and right now we're just doing similar to everyone else but better. But im not improving humanity at all, im just maintaining the status quo. I want to change the world and help advance, but unfortunately it requires significantly more of this fake creation called money. 

Thats why I say gamble. The money I have, yes it makes my family comfortable, which is fine, but its not even that much, and even moreso, im unfulfilled bc, altho im.trying every single day it seems, we just seem so far away from turning a corner in my industry towards a more sustainable process"
03/15/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/15/2021,stocks,"No trolling. Having a solid savings to build on is always good advice. To be clear, I am all for and highly encourage investing at any age (with a solid understanding of what your investing in and how it all works). I am also highly advocating investing in and growing your savings and yourself so that you can put a higher percentage into stocks without RELYING on them to make you money."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I already explained my mistake above, my mistake was not investing at 18 with my spare income.  If I had literally thrown my money anywhere other than in the trash I would be a whale today.  Investing is saving, except your money makes you money instead of losing money.  

Saving 100,000 dollars by the time youre 40 means you still have 100,000 dollars.  Congratulations you lost money."
03/15/2021,stocks,"oh balls. i had no idea. Thats just a target for right now, im nowhere near a point in my life to be ready to take this on 100% im sure that number will change as i learn more about this whole topic. Im slowly learning things as I go through and meet friends of friends that are real estate agents, mortgage lenders etc. Im learning things through conversations like this. Thank you, for this insight. I have more things i can talk about and ask when im around and chatting with people that might have more/better answers than i can google."

03/15/2021,stocks,"But saving 100,000 by the time I'm 40 while also having 50,000 and growing in stocks means I have 150,000 while still growing in not only positive stocks, but personal investments. Assets outside of stock be damned, though, right? Set to retire by 45, by the way."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah man, since you continue to double down on stupid it’s really difficult to continue explaining to you over and over again why what youre saying is stupid.  

I feel like you’ve just gotten yourself into a hole, and instead of climbing out, you have asked for a shovel and started digging deeper.  

The last piece of advice I’ll leave anyone following this thread with is that your rate of return in the stock market (in wise investments) is currently and typically significantly higher than home loan and car interest rates.  

You can have assets that net positive income without having to pay them off immediately (cars/rvs/boats are not assets).  I have two houses that other people are paying for me while still coping money for maintenance and extra cash in my bank to further invest with.  The houses are increasing in value, but I am not paying any of the interest or taxes (while getting some nice tax breaks myself that I would lose if the houses were paid off)."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Oh, I'm sure. That hole I dug has set me up to be ready for retirement at a significantly younger age than my generation is expected to retire and will build something I can hand down to my kids with 0 debt. But I guess my experience in investing and losing in the stock market at a young age is less significant than your not investing at all and playing what if. Difference is I don't let the NYSE dictate any of my finances. I'm set whether I lose or gain in stocks."
2021-03-15 04:29:24,stocks,"Forecasting U.S. Cannabis Stocks to 2022  Hello, I am new to forecasting and doing analysis in general. I thought it would be fun to do some forecasting and finding some good entry points for this year. I would love some feedback and some constructive criticism . Full discloser, **I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.** I have interest to adding shares if the entry point it good.

The hard part of forecasting these stocks are that they are not profitable, a lot of assumptions will have to be made and the numbers are probably going to be way off.

The values I will be using are; projected Growth Rate in 2022 (%), Minimum Rate of Return (%), Margin of Safety (%), projected P/E ratio (multiplying growth rate by 2), and projected 2022 EPS ($). **Most of these values I will be getting from Seeking Alpha under the Earnings Revisions tab.**

My Minimum Rate of Return will be 20% and Margin of Safety of 30%. My opinion is that these values are very conservative and gives a large room for error.

**Curaleaf (CURLF):**

Projected Growth Rate: **46.06%** Projected P/E ratio: **92.12** Projected EPS: **$0.35**

By multiplying the P/E ratio by the EPS we get a estimated 2022 share price of **$32.24**, now we multiply by Minimum rate of return back to this year to get a estimated 2021 share price of **$25.79**. Then multiply by Margin of Safety we get a estimated entry point of **$18.05.**

**Cresco Labs Inc (CRLBF):**

Estimated Projected Growth Rate: **35.34%** Estimated Projected P/E ratio: **70.68** Estimated Projected EPS: **$0.61**

Estimated 2022 share price of **$43.11**, Estimated 2021 share price of **$34.49**, Estimated Entry point of **$24.14**.

**Columbia Care Inc (CCHWF)**

Estimated Projected Growth Rate: **43.8** **%** Estimated Projected P/E ratio: **87.6** Estimated Projected EPS: **$0.18**

Estimated 2022 share price of **$15.76**, Estimated 2021 share price of **$13.40**, Estimated Entry point of **$9.38**.

**Green Thumb Industries Inc (GTBIF)**

Estimated Projected Growth Rate: **31.02** **%** Estimated Projected P/E ratio: **62.04** Estimated Projected EPS: **$0.70**

Estimated 2022 share price of **$43.42**, Estimated 2021 share price of **$34.74**, Estimated Entry point of **$27.79**.

**Planet 13 Holdings (PLNHF)**

Estimated Projected Growth Rate: **33.56** **%** Estimated Projected P/E ratio: **67.12** Estimated Projected EPS: **$0.17**

Estimated 2022 share price of **$11.41**, Estimated 2021 share price of **$9.12**, Estimated Entry point of **$6.38**.

**Again, this is all an estimate and will most likely be wrong.** Let me know what you think, was I too conservative? Not conservative enough? Should I have used different values? All I know is that I like the stocks!"
03/15/2021,stocks,"One thing I read recently of interest is how the ""black market"" will keep the growers margins in check.  Estimated 5 years to get that under control (which basically means they have no idea)."
03/15/2021,stocks,Personally thinking BATS or other tobacco companies could be interesting potentially for playing a part in the distribution of weed products once legalized. Seems like they've already begun that pivot/transition.
03/15/2021,stocks,I went to Washington state two years ago and the prices were comparable to NY street prices. I'm sure a lot of penny Cannabis stocks will have issues but I dont see how well established companies prices wont rise in the next 2-5 years. It's not like weed will become less legal than it is over time.
03/15/2021,stocks,"We just over two years legal in Canada and last quarter was the first quarter legal weed outsold the black market. So 5 years to be dominate would be accurate. As a user and investor I can say legal weed was a giant mess when it started and took a year to sort out and then a year to grow. It’s way better buying weed in store now compared to a year ago. Canada a bit different story as we went from illegal to legal over night and a provincial rule free for all and companies with no profits. America has legal states, decent companies already, so it should go smoother."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Who's going to supply this massive black market after the country legalizes? The Cartels are already getting out of the weed smuggling business. Producers are all going to sell to the legal markets, why break the law when you can make good money doing it legally?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Also Canadian - commercial weed is okay and in my experience the service has been outstanding in brick and mortar, but the price is prohibitive vs. black market dope.  Have no idea how they intend to curb ""illegal"" dope growth."

03/15/2021,stocks,"hmm, honestly I have no idea what a black market is, thank you for the insight and giving me something to look more into!"
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah the fact that going to a dispensary still costs about 3x my local dealer when my local dealer also has consistent deals/discounts/bonus gifts makes it very hard to convince myself to go to a dispensary over black market

03/15/2021,stocks,Black market would be buying from my local weed dealer.
03/15/2021,stocks,Black market is probably how 80% of marijuana is purchased as it is not legal in many states. Also curaleaf is a dispensary here in NJ and it’s absolutely terrible.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Exactly. With all the legal regulation standards, excise and sales tax added up, it costs at least twice more than my street guy. Taxes (Excise and sales) alone in California are close to 40%"
03/15/2021,stocks,ohhh... well I feel dumb lol.
03/15/2021,stocks,What is terrible about it compared to others you've visited?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah i know how you feel, here in canada an oz of AAA or AAAA at a dispensary is probably gunna cost you upwards of $300 whereas my local guy has the same quality or better with more selection at around 100-150 plus extras and bonuses the more you buy"
03/15/2021,stocks,Curaleaf has the best prices in the state. The buds they sell themself are below par. I’ve seen pictures with mold on Curaleaf buds and I’ve personally picked up from Curaleaf for the weed to smell like hay. It was uncured and even with the cheap prices I won’t go to CL
03/15/2021,stocks,"A family friend of mine is a medical marijuana patient in NJ. Besides the terrible customer service, the quality of weed in the MM dispensaries is very low. It doesn't really help him with his condition. He could find better weed on the streets than official dispensaries."
03/15/2021,stocks,"That's unfortunate about the quality, but from what we've seen in Canada it seems like people are more interested in quantity over quality (though I'm not sure to that extent).

Hopefully they can figure that out soon.

At the moment it looks like im just gonna invest and forget about it for the next 3-5 years. What are your thoughts on it? Any other big ( equals kinda safe?) players I should consider? Dont want to spread this small amount of money too much.

03/15/2021,stocks,"1) VOO

2) SCHD

3) QQQ

4) VTWO

5) research a longer-shot ""winner"" play that's closer to gambling. Personally I'm going MOGO. If your pick for this slot is a good one, you guarantee yourself to beat the market. The first four slots I chose are really just more effective ways at getting the upside profile of your picks, but with much less risk."
03/15/2021,stocks,Amazon? One share of Amazon is 75% of what you investing .  Choose soemthing else dude
03/15/2021,stocks,"My only thought that comes in mind with these are: 

1. Alibaba

How much do you know about this company? Ever been to their website? Why invest in this company? What makes them special?

2. Amazon

$1.56 trillion market cap. How much room does it actually have to grow? Do you have access to fractional shares because 1 share of this is 3/5th your portfolio. Are you concerned with big daddy government stepping in and breaking this company up? 

3. Disney

Solid. I own it. No questions. 

4. Facebook

$780 billion market cap, how much can it grow realistically? Same issue as Amazon, in terms of the government stepping in. 

5. Apple

$2.03 trillion market cap. For you to make 100% return apple would be a 4 trillion dollar company, is that realistic? 

I own these stocks but though index funds. I just don’t know how much more gains you can have on a 2 trillion dollar company. During the Dot com bubble MSFT reached a market cap just over $560 billion, adjusting for inflation thats about $950 billion in today’s money.

Imo stick with an index fund like VTI or VOO"
03/15/2021,stocks,Nope on all of those. You can’t even afford 100 of any of them. Therefore you couldnt sell calls and make real money. Got much to learn padawan.
03/15/2021,stocks,"> $5000 will get you, uh, one each of those 5? Amazon being almost $3100 all by itself... and several of those are at a fairly high price already. 

OP doesn't state where they are from, but there is the possibility to buy fractional shares with some trading apps. Trading 212 in the UK does allow it. He could put 1k into each.

But yeah, I'd probably still go with your second suggestion if wants to set it and forget it."
03/15/2021,stocks,OP could buy fractional.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yup - I have 3 Ark’s, all currently down between 18-25% so there is risk... long term I’m still a believier in the sectors but it can be a bit nerve racking if your always watching. Buy now is def. the time to pile in anew then delete the app."

03/15/2021,stocks,I saw that too 😂
03/15/2021,stocks,Two year spanking the market and out performing literally everybody. Yeah explain the risk.
03/15/2021,stocks,Not worth it. Can easily go with something else
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you really think this justifies the assessment of ""no risk"", then I can't help you.

2021-03-15 03:47:38,stocks,"$HIMS - Hims & Hers  

Hey fellow investors 

I wanted to share my DD on a company I am very bullish on $HIMS. An incoming catalyst in the form of year end 2020 earnings is set to be announced 3/18. This was trading in the 20s in February.

**About the company**

Hims & Hers Health is a is a fast growing telehealth and mail order wellness product provider. The company launched in 2017 targeting the male consumer hair regrowth and erectile dysfunction markets. A few months later, Hers, their female health company was launched offering birth control, skin care, and hair care products.

**Financial Analysis**  
Below are some key financial takeaways and indicators. HIMS has done a great job at retaining customers while also managing its cost to acquire them (see next section)

* Estimated 128% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2018 to 2020
* 91% recurring revenue
* 71% gross margins
* Over 2 million cumulative consultations
* More than 250,000 customer subscriptions
* Sales increase expectations are 66% increase to 138 million for 2020

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**

In subscription based business models, acquiring customers is an extremely costly aspect. In 2019, HIMS spent over 150 million on CAC. Through the first 2 quarters of 2020 they only spend 17 million (graph below). Keeping the same trajectory for year end 2020 would result in a 75% decrease.

Website Traffic

Website traffic has considerably grown from Q1 of 2020 vs Q4 of 2020

PS. I am long $HIMS because it has potential comparable to TDOC

&#x200B;

PSS this is not financial advice"
03/15/2021,stocks,I’ve seen this company pop up a few times now.  Thanks for the DD I’m going to look into it for sure.  If there is one thing that ppl will spend money on its looking better and sex!!
03/15/2021,stocks,Are these guys into hair loss treatments like finasteride? The stigma is mellowing out and I hear a lot men approaching 30 that are taking it
03/15/2021,stocks,I am also heavily invested in HIMS. I can't wait for their ER on thursday. I do believe they have been lowballing their guidance. (underpromise overdeliver)
03/15/2021,stocks,Long HIMS too.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Sorry, but this company basically sells extremely overpriced boner pills with a “prescription”.  It’s not worth 3 billion and has minimal growth potential.  

Cialis has talk of becoming OTC, and if that happens this company is dead.  And there really is not any reason Cialis shouldn’t be OTC, as it’s extremely safe."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I went big on this company, glad to see some DD in favor. 

Now that my confirmation bias is affirmed will double down!"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Feels like buying into the next shamwow. The graph looks like the future is sideways or down. The endorsements are famous rich people but by today's pop culture standards they are old af.

Logically not seeing this being a good buy"
03/15/2021,stocks,Me being one of them... not a boomer though
03/15/2021,stocks,"I am way out of the target audience here, but I do know my dad and FIL take testosterone (I haven’t talked to them about it directly). What’s the deal here? I thought it was just used for lifting but it seems to be becoming mainstream with older men?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"is that seriously a growing market though? black market test is dirt cheap, the expensive part of ""hrt"" is the blood tests and the drugs to deal with possible complications.

especially with many places decriminalizing simple possession of small amounts of drugs."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yea, and I've had a lot of 30 year old friends get HIMS for the generic viagra boner pills too. There's usually a little hesitance to bring it up but then after a couple beers it's more like ""Oh you got them too? Fucking AWESOME right?!""  


Boner pills are awesome. And my doctor probably wouldn't prescribe them anyway. I would have to exaggerate a ""problem"" and look him in the eye. But online it's easy."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Hopefully Cialis does become OTC because you're right. But there will still be a lot of prescriptions that are relatively safe that will never become OTC in the US (or it will take a long time).   


The real play is investing in the easy online accessibility. Whether that's avoiding stigma and face time with your family doc, or simply not wanting the inconvenience of going into a doctor office.  


Boner pills are a great start, but the branding goes beyond that and it's not a one-trick pony company. Even if Cialis goes OTC, this telehealth play still has merit."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Telehealth is not shamwow. 

Mail order boner pills, testosterone, uti care, dermatology, ssri's etc is a high margin business. The last year has proved how difficult it is to get to a real primary care doc. Most of these things don't need/require an in office visit. 

Hard part is value. Company is not profitable and market cap is over $2B."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Lots of men are embarrassed about perceived impotence and the decline with age and are too prideful to talk with a doctor face to face about their less than stellar performance.

There are other legit medical issues that may need testosterone. But I always felt HIMS was a bit predatory, especially when they love advertising to young men and teens."
03/15/2021,stocks,"You want a healthy amount of test in your system, lifting or not. For whatever the reason, perhaps diet, more guys than ever have low test levels for their age. It contributes to just about everything about your well being, your sexual performance, energy, happiness, etc."
03/15/2021,stocks,I’ve switched to getting mine from TRT clinics rather than black market. It’s not much more (since test is cheap anyway) and I get the peace of mind of having a script (since I travel) for it and purity
03/15/2021,stocks,Nobody trusts black market test and everyone wants pharma grade. Plus the market for legal hrt is growing especially now a days with all the soy boys
03/15/2021,stocks,Do you foresee any upcoming catalysts that would make its market cap/valuation more feasible?
2021-03-15 03:40:10,stocks,"How can I find any information on a company I have an old paper stock certificate from 1917? Edit: Looks like it was acquired by another company and then that company dissolved in 1950. Thanks for all your help guys!

I have a situation like the post on the front page earlier today. I found a paper certificate from my late great grandfathers things for 100 shares of a company named The Southern Alberta Land Company Limited. I have tried googling the company and I can't find any information on it. I don't know if the company has long gone bust or bought out or still running. 

I was wondering is there any way to find out about the company, if the shares are worth anything. Is there any resource or website out there to discover these things?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you do find it is worthless, you may be able to sell it. I was volunteering at a thrift shop and someone donated a bunch of them for defunct companies. A local coin and stamp company bought a bunch of them for $3 to $10 each. Not much but better than recycling it or throwing it out."
03/15/2021,stocks,Worse case scenario you could find a collector of stock certificates (some are basically works of art) and hopefully get a good price. May want to consider framing it and keeping it yourself if you like the look.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Found this paragraph in an article. 


The Southern Alberta Land Company began construction of water diversion works in 1909, but failure or legal inability to sell irrigation lands before it had completed construction of all the irrigation works, coupled with a major accident at one of its headgates and a severe tightening of the financial markets in London just before the outbreak of World War I, forced the Southern Alberta Land Company into receivership in June 1914. Difficult and legally contentious negotiations resulted in acquisition of the assets and obligations of the Southern Alberta Land Company by the Canada Land and Irrigation Company in 1917.

03/15/2021,stocks,Or get it appraised by someone into antiques.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Then Canada Land and Irrigation Co, which took control of your company, looks to have dissolved in 1950 according to this link.

03/15/2021,stocks,"That's a good idea. If it is worthless and someone really wanted it I'd probably just give it to them free of charge. It might make some collector happy, who knows."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Buy the dip, they're primed to take off any day now"
03/15/2021,stocks,Thanks I will consider that. At the moment is is looking like it is worthless but maybe someone like a collector might appreciate it.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Thank you! I'll search on google books for any information. Hopefully we will be lucky and it has been merged, although another reply said they think the company was dissolved."

03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah it looks like I won't be a gazillionaire anytime soon. Thanks for looking it up!
03/15/2021,stocks,Thanks! I think I'll do this if I run out of avenues online.

2021-03-15 03:20:23,stocks,"Qualified covered calls test Hello.

I was wondering if there was a test to see if a covered call is qualified or not?

I read that a covered call is always qualified if it’s OTM, and I’ve also read it has to be OTM and over 30 days. I’ve also ready the time matters more than the value... 
I was wondering if y’all had any insight. 

Thank you"
03/15/2021,stocks,I’m assuming as it relates to the dividend paid while holding.
03/15/2021,stocks,"It’s not about dividend. Something to do with calculating holding periods on stocks. And non-qualified covered calls are short term gains and qualified covered calls are long term. 

It seems like the longer the call (but under a hear) and OTM covered calls are more in line with qualified. 

It looks like they did it to cover a loop hole with changing the year you could claim gains or losses.

I just want to know how to make sure my covered calls are qualified. The gains are already fairly small, and don’t want higher tax to eat them up or less up the timer on my stocks"
03/15/2021,stocks,Qualified to be assigned perhaps?
2021-03-15 03:03:42,stocks,"Almost a year after the Covid-19 dip, could those who have been waiting for long-term capital gains be selling soon? Just wanted to know everyone's thoughts on this.

This upcoming week last year was the bottom in 2020, so could those people who bought then be waiting until now to start selling for long-term capital gains, and if so, would this be in big enough volume to cause a sizable dip?

Personally, I think we'll see some sideways movement for a while, especially considering $SPY is close to a psychological resistance of 400, which may be difficult to go above."
03/15/2021,stocks,Doubt it since a lot of people have 100%+ gains and the difference for most people on short vs long-term cap gains is around 5%. Probably more important for them to protect high profits than worry about taxes.
03/15/2021,stocks,The recovery was fast but still gradual. I don't have stats but I doubt the majority of people who invested last year did so in March or April.
03/15/2021,stocks,But would the selling happen in tech? Doubt it since most hyper growth names are off their ATH. If any selling for long term gain purposes happens it will just pile back into tech if you ask me.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes, I am going to be thinking of selling my LUV (Southwest Airlines) pretty much exactly when it is long term gains in the first week of June.

Oil stocks I may hold, I would really need to see what the supple/demand balance looks like."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Lots of people don't have the discipline if that is what they always intended. 

But more than that the volatility would make most people sell way before that."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes but for high earners (who have more money and thus a higher per capita effect on the market), have a significant difference between cap gains and income tax."

The World Health Organization defines genomics as the study of genes and their functions and related techniques.

03/15/2021,stocks,Notice how everyone is naming completely different stocks? Good luck OP
03/15/2021,stocks,Or just buy ARKG
03/15/2021,stocks,$CRSP
03/15/2021,stocks,"Since you want to invest in genomics because of ARKG, why don't you just check their holdings"
03/15/2021,stocks,Split it between them all.

03/15/2021,stocks,Don't forget TenXGenomics (TXG)
03/15/2021,stocks,BEAM. They literally have sole proprietorship over prime editing. I’ve never liked CRSP
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm finishing my PhD in genetics atm and would say 10x genomics has good potential. They provide testing for single-cell expression which is the new ""hot"" thing in transcription studies and is gradually seeing more common usage (price is main barrier for large studies atm).

The older/big companies like Illumina focus on sequencing chips, but this has little room for growth since whole exome and whole genome sequencing are becoming more affordable.

Regeneron did whole exome & genome sequencing for the UK Biobank and have access to the data before everyone else, so if they find something they can comercialise in the data then that could potentially give them a big boost."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I believe CRSP is the clear leader in the field but if ur holding for 5 years know that it’s services may not be publicly used even by then, It’s a new technology that is pretty much GMOs for humans and people are scared of it. but none the less I like it more than the other two."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Of I were you I would gamble on ARKG and outsource my choice(s) to Cathie Wood. ARKG os an ETF that invests exclusively into genomics companies, by buying it you are buying into multiple companies at once. Plus it's actively managed ETF, composition can (and does) change day to day."
03/15/2021,stocks,There's a clear plurality that are saying CRSPR (of those who are actually naming an individual stock). ARKG is a great investment but I'm just looking to gamble on an individual stock.

03/15/2021,stocks,"It’ll take a few years, potentially up to a decade, but this whole sector is going to explode. I hold CRSP, NTLA, BEAM, ALLO, and a little DTIL. I had some in EDIT as well but pulled out until they get their management sorted out, and put it into ARKG. Also illumina. they make the gene sequencing machines, and was granted FDA emergency use authoriZation for sequencing based COVID testing. Highly accurate and complete within 24 hours. They expect to be more widely available by summer. Which is cool.  

As far as picking the “winner” in this industry, to me kind of feel like asking who was gonna win back in the day when apple, IBM, and Microsoft were coming up. They’re all going to win."

I'd say CRSP does have a lot of potential and I get the hype around it, but its success will depend on a global ethical consensus which hasn't been addressed yet. The make or break for CRSP and gene editing treatments in general will be what sitiuations it gets approved for (i.e. will germ-line treatments be deemed acceptable and which diseases people think should or should not be treated with gene editing). There's a lot of strong and mixed feelings in the field around this which will be amplified once these questions are brought to the general public. He's work (the Chinese group that used CRISPR on human embryos) is a major set-back for this because of the bs he pulled (I'll avoid a long rant on this).

03/15/2021,stocks,"Just buy yourself some bitcoin.

https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin

Click on max zoom out for the chart, look at the market cap, look at who's started to invest in crypto in the last half a year or so, and ask yourself if you think that market is likely to go to zero at this point.

Fun fact 99% of retail BTC traders aren't aware of: Bitcoin isn't a ""buy low, try to sell high"" stock anymore- it's now being treated like deeds to undeveloped property by investment lenders.

As of the last 4-6 years, it's been discovered it can be used as a collateralizeable asset that you can repeatedly squeeze for tax free investment cash as the value rises. If you spend that crypto loan on business expenses (say expanding your home business), that can potentially *reduce* your tax obligations for the year with no cash spent out of pocket for that expansion. 

Crypto lending is *extremely* profitable, because there are no 'bad debts' to be written off.

Bitcoin loans are fully secured by the value of the bitcoin the lender holds, so no debts are owed if you default. They'd just sell off *just* enough coin to cover the loan + interest, and send you back what's left. Much better than defaulting with the deed to your home or car.

If your bitcoin rises in value when you have cash out, you can withdraw your bitcoin to start earning up to 5-6% yearly interest on it (paid out in BTC), or you can pull out more cash without having ever paid off any of the original loan + interest first. Google the words ""Digital asset collateral"" for more info there.

Instituional investors like Microstrategy and Tesla are buying bitcoin for use as a hedge against inflation (there's a permanently limited number of bitcoin units that will ever exist), and for use as colalteral (with lenders like Fidelity Digital Assets). They are *not* trying to play make some goofy ""sell BTC to retail when the price is high enough"" gamble for short term gains.

I dumped my entire stimulus check into bitcoin, immediately took out a 5.9% cash loan against the value, and plan to use that cash to finish stuffing my Roth IRA on Monday before the 2020 deadline (I only started dealing with my Roth in addition my 401k recently).

In general, bitcoin loans are best used on investments that will eventually repay their own loan + interest, leaving you as owner of the remaining assets, any future returns, and getting your bitcoin back for use on the next investment."

2021-03-15 02:26:54,stocks,"Amazon CC or PMCC? What am I missing? I'm new to options investing and I need advice.

I've been selling covered calls on AMZN, usually with a .20 Delta, and making around 1500/week in premium.

I love the big premium and I'm looking to get more.

If the CC option is ever exercised, I think it makes sense to buy some LEAPS options on AMZN and sell PMCCs.

Here's my reasoning:

100 shares of AMZN costs (roughly) $300,000 and a weekly CC sells for (roughly) $1500

Three (JAN 2023) LEAPS with an 80 Delta costs (roughly) $300,000. And writing three covered calls against the three LEAPS would bring in $4500.

Seems like the 3 LEAPS will earn more in premium each week compared to the covered calls. I am bullish on AMZN shares going up in value by 2023. In addition to the juicy premium, the LEAPS options would be more valuable as the stock price goes up, right?

This sounds too good to be true, so what am I missing?

TL,DR: Looks like I can make higher weekly premiums selling PMCCs on my LEAPS instead of Traditional CCs. How am I wrong?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think you're forgetting the the obvious difference that with a CC you own the 100 shares at the end of your play. If the stock stays neutral, you still have $300,000 worth of stock. If your LEAP stays neutral, or god forbid goes down, then they can expire worthless and you can kiss that $300,000 goodbye.

It's all about what level of risk you think is worth the that added monthly premium if $3k. Somewhere out there, someone had the same idea as you and had a LEAP expiring March 2020 thinking there was no way AMZN could go south. And then a completely unforseen event happened. That person would have lost their initial deposit, instead of holding out with their original stock."
03/15/2021,stocks,Cc on AMZN? You're rich dude.
03/15/2021,stocks,You're missing an exit strategy on your LEAPS but that's it.  Should work great!

2021-03-15 02:25:10,stocks,"FLYR AS, new starter airlines Norway I little DD on newest airline starter FLYR AS Norway 

Some say it’s the worst of times, others say it’s the best of times. 


My PERSONAL opinion is that, it’s the BEST of times

Why? Because it’s not like that countries and people will be looked forever. The population has not decreased, a drone airlines has not been suddenly invented. So of course people will soon be traveling again . And maybe more than EVER. Because I think that the appetite for travel will be immense in the coming months and years.

One,s loss is others gain, They say.

All airlines in the world has suffered, also in Europe, and specially in Norway. One of the best low cost airlines (Norwegian) in Europe of the past decade have had huge problems. Their bankruptcy issue is still not settled, they have canceled and reduced their fleet, are on the verge of more share dilution etc etc. 

Source.  https://www.google.dk/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/norwegian-air-updates-offer-creditors-080158464.html

Norwegian,s loss,? FLYR AS gain ?


Here comes FLYR AS. This new starter , I believe has huge potential. But can also be risky. 

First the potential 



1. FLYR AS board members are former Norwegian people.

Tonje Wikstroem Frislid, a former Norwegian Air executive.

Brede Huser, former director Norwegian Reward

Thomas Ramdahl, former commercial director Norwegian

Asgeir Nyseth, former operations director Norwegian

Alf Sagen, has long experience in Norwegian 

Bjørn Erik Barman-Jenssen, former chief for ground services and cargo in Norwegian

Tord Meling, has experience from Deloitte and many years in Norwegian, as a chief for airplanes financing. 

Source below is in norsk, but you can translate via google, and get an understanding.

https://e24.no/naeringsliv/i/LnA551/erik-g-braathen-i-allianse-med-tidligere-norwegian-topper-starter-nytt-norsk-flyselskap

2. FLYR is, I believe DEBT FREE, very positive if true. couldn’t find source.

3. Their timing is very good ,considering how cheaply they can lease planes at the moment. The whole airlines market has been struck like never before. Customer vise I believe every airline might have to start from scratch.

4. On their website you can see, that they are looking for pilots, and other crew members. Great timing for hiring.

https://career.flyr.no/jobs

Osm Aviation have began recruiting pilots for them. Translate via google 

https://e24.no/boers-og-finans/i/56R4jm/osm-aviation-rekrutterer-piloter-for-flyr

5. There plan is to begin flying in the summer

https://www.flyr.no/en

Currently FLYR AS provides travel solutions, it offers booking, check-in, boarding,changing the time or adding luggage details as per convenient on mobil. 





The risky part.

1. they are a new company.

2.They don’t have a LICENSE yet.

3.They still have to establish them selves in the market. 

4. They don’t have a fleet yet. 



Conclusion: FLYR stock has huge potential, let’s say they are granted license, stock goes up.  

They announce leasing of planes, stock goes up, they announce the distinctions they,ll be flying to, stock goes up, they put ticket for sale , stock goes up, they make their first flight , stock goes up etc etc. huge potential.

Of course their are risks, imagine they get denied a license, stock goes way way down.

But I am not an expert to know can they be denied license, and why, and how can that be known before it happens?  

Isn’t license a formality?? When you have a strong and experienced people, who knows what they are doing? 

They applied for license in the 28th October 2020. 

Above are just my opinion, please do your own DD, this is not a financial advice."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't go near this airline, or any other for that matter. 

I hate to say this and I do not wish this to happen, but it wouldn't surprise me if planes start falling out of the sky left right and centre in the coming months. So many planes have been grounded for so long, [there are bound to be maintenance errors, nests growing in plane instruments and pilots will inevitably be rusty](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-airlines-safety-idUKKBN28O33D). I think on the basis of pure probability there will be some kind of accident as the world comes out of Covid, if not several. Not to mention the Boeing 737-max is returning to service and I have huge reservations still about the vetting process that plane has gone through. I still wouldn't fly on it.

On that basis, I would not invest in any airline, let alone one that is still finding its feet and likely to cut many corners in the face of keeping costs down in the Covid era. 

I see this as a high-risk play where the potential upside (if any) does not make this worth taking on.

Thanks for the DD though."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Actually as of this moment I am still doing research on it.

Erik G. Braathen  who found this airlines , was in the board of directors when Norwegian air shuttle had IPO, I just read the PDF document from 2008. He left the company in 2009. 

And the current FLYR AS CEO Tonje Wikstroem Frislid job description below at Norwegian Air shuttle. 

2007-2016
Vice President, Crew Management, Norwegian Air Resources

2003-2005
and personal hiring, Norwegian Air Shuttle

You can check out the performance of Norwegian air shuttle in those, years these 2 were on the board. 

I am not saying that these 2 were the cause, different times and many other great people were factors as well.

I am just worried about the license part actually, but the board are very experienced and competent people.

The applied for the license , here is a part of the document 

In order to commence air traffic activities, the Company is dependent on obtaining an air operating certificate (""AOC"") from the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway (the ""NCAA""). The Company submitted an AOC application to the NCAA on 28 October 2020.

Cathie Wood buys more $BFLY

[https://cathiesark.com/arkg/trades](https://cathiesark.com/arkg/trades)

&#x200B;

I wanted to do a quick summary of the ticker $BFLY and share some of my thoughts of the emerging ultrasound technology that has been gaining traction the the medical field!

I've gotten some sentiment from others about their thoughts on BFLY and how they compare to other similar products in the Ultrasound market.  I believe people should understand the main differences and similarities of these products , so that, we can distinguish that BFLY is a superior technology to its competitors.  I believe that the Butterfly IQ is the most cost effective device in the market for small and large practices alike.

&#x200B;

**The Butterfly IQ, Handheld Machine Pros and Cons**

**PRO:** 3 in 1, device as opposed to using multiple different probes for scanning different systems.

**PRO**: Butterfly IQ is the only ultrasound transducer that can preform ""whole body imaging"" which a **ONE** probe as opposed to multiple different probes.

Other devices including the Clarius 2 and Lumify use crystals inside of the different various probes for different medical uses.  Traditional Probes are more fragile and can be easily damaged if dropped.

**PRO:** The Butterfly has semiconducter/microchip technology allows for 2-D array of 9000 microsensors to emulate any type of probe i.e. Linear, Curved, or phased.

I've heard ""Why would I buy a cheaper product for medical imaging?""  The materials are cheaper to make than the crystals in traditional probes which significantly lowers the cost for health care providers.

**PRO:** Butterfly Cloud  Seamless importing, exporting, and sharing of Ultrasound scans

One of the most important part of Ultrasound imaging is the image quality.  One of downsides to the Butterfly is that it is a new technology and is still in the process of improving its image quality.  Clarius V2  and Lumify have superior quality, but when comparing to the price, this makes sense.

**PRO**: AVG Price of Butterfly products/services: \~$2500 w/ a $420 annual membership, easier to roll out to 3rd world countries that need Ultrasound imaging for various medical reasons.

**PRO:** Ergonomic and 2 Hour scanning time.

**PRO:** Android and Apple IOS compatible

**PRO:**  Very easy presets for different systems of the body to examine.

**PRO:** Highly Assessible Support team

**CONS:** Wired, imaging quality not as good as the other handheld devices, New firmware, potential cord damage, non removable battery/battery drain.

&#x200B;

**Product Comparisons:**

**Clarius V2 Pros and Cons:**

Pros: Good Image quality, Wireless, Probe Controls, up to 15Mhz, Better Spatial imaging, Compatible with Andriod and Apple, no subscription, Unlimited cloud storage, shock proof

Cons: Heavier and bigger than standard probe, not ergonomic, Expensive/high costs,$\~6000, 45-60 mins per battery( device tends to heat up), wireless connectivity issues, MANY different probes for various different applications.

Features:  [https://clarius.com/scanners/c3/specifications/](https://clarius.com/scanners/c3/specifications/), specific to the multipurpose probe.

**Lumify Pros and Cons:**

Pros: Superior Image Quality, Lightweight probes, up to 12 Mhz,Android compatible, 6 hr battery life, Ergonomic, seamless connectivity

Cons:  Expensive/high cost, \~$10,000,Wired, no IOS app, need for multiple probes for different uses, not compatible with all android devices.

Features:

[https://www.ultrasoundsupply.com/products/ultrasound-machines/philips-ultrasound/philips-lumify/#:\~:text=The%20Philips%20Lumify%20integrated%20most,range%20cart%20based%20ultrasound%20system](https://www.ultrasoundsupply.com/products/ultrasound-machines/philips-ultrasound/philips-lumify/#:~:text=The%20Philips%20Lumify%20integrated%20most,range%20cart%20based%20ultrasound%20system)

In summary, as of right now, Butterfly IQ does not produce the BEST image quality; although, I think it is the best value for smaller practices.  I do believe that this technology can easily be updated overtime with its patented microchip technology.  With firmware updates, we could start to see a demand for this product!  The cost effectiveness far outweighs the downsides of the image quality.

The demand for this type of product in 3rd world countries I believe is significant in providing practical healthcare with cost in mind.  I also believe this cost is attractive for new practices that can't afford the higher priced devices!

Positions:

10 shares @ 18.65 Avg

03/15/2021,stocks,"What it's trying to say is that it can help perform all standard ultrasounds normally done by multiprobe machines. But I see you point regarding endocavitary probes. That being said, most ERs, most clinics, we don't use endocavitary probes routinely. A lot of my colleagues buy them to have their own when getting IVs, doing other procedures like nerve blocks, and overall they love the product. I plan on getting one myself. It won't replace our fancy ED machines, but it's becoming standard of care to have our own. I do an average of 5 ultrasound scans per shift and it's a pain to go grab a large machine when i have a yes or no question out of the butterfly. Billing can be built in ad long as providers have x normal of scans and we can pass images into the medical record, but honestly a lot of the stuff we need it for don't need to be billed for separately. I do see a lot of future for this company, much rather have a butterfly than a stethoscope any shift."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Thank you! I’m an ED doc and have been trying to post the same thing across these “DD”s. While I like the product and use it myself, it just isn’t a good investment. They don’t have a market to expand to. It’s essentially just a neat trick."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I work in a county hospital. We bill and store our self ED performed ultrasounds. Private hospitals tend to rely on official ultrasounds done by techs, BUT providers still use the machines all the time for procedures, it's simply standard of care now to do most procedures under ultrasound guidance. That's not about missing diagnoses but simply making things safer. This has a ton of potential. Most of my colleagues and I plan on having one of these as soon."

This isn't meant to replace our official ultrasounds to check for liver cancer or high risk pregnancies , these are machines for procedures (see blood vessels , see where we are inserting needles into). In third world counties or low resources settings without a CT, these little machines can tell you quickly whether someone very short of breath has heart failure, horrible pneumonia, or large amount of fluid around the heart. It can make any procedures easier and safer immediately. It is also not expensive as healthcare equipment goes.  ER/urgent care pays $200-300 an hour, providers can pay this no problem. For clinics or EDs is a small investment to increase safety for their procedures."

They somehow suddenly started reporting low revenue 5 years ago. Every financial report is almost the same. I can clearly see the operational cost and it is quite higher than it should be in my opinion but the main hoax is about ""Cost of Sales"" when I compare the biggest company in the sector they work with 22% percent gross revenue while this company ( second big brand ) is on 12% gross revenue but I can't see the details of ""Cost of Sales"" unfortunately. So what may they be doing? I can't believe while the other brand is working with 25% ROE this company is only %5 it is ridiculous. And everyday on TV I can see their adverts :) like they are doing it on purpose right after announcing the report haha They are doing something but not sure what it may be. Since they were paying high divident maybe they are buying their own shares secretly, then they will change their %35 percent free float rate to %15 or something? They are allowed to reduce it as low as %5 Can they do that? Will doing this, paying less divident give any benefit to them?"

I’m fairly new to investing (for fun; i have safe long-term stocks in another account) and yes, I got into investing for fun after the gamestop craze. I had some extra money just to play around with for now. I’ve done my research on what shorting means and still, for the life of me, cannot understand how it works. 

How would a regular everyday investor (like me) short a stock? Or is it not something that an everyday investor can do? From my understanding, it is borrowing a stock and selling it at a higher price than it would later be valued at. But is that something I would be able to do (if I wanted to)? Please ELI5.😅

For context, I’m a Canadian investor using wealthsimple generally only investing in stocks on the TSX and considering moving over to questrade for NYSE and NASDAQ. TIA"
03/15/2021,stocks,Don’t short unless you master the long first. Most short seller are very experienced.
03/15/2021,stocks,"In a regular trading account you’d have to be approved for Margin to Short Sell.

Isnt it cash + portfolio value? Since brokerage can close other positions to cover if required?"
2021-03-15 01:21:00,stocks,"Should I be using stop losses on some stocks? Pros, cons One of my largest holdings is AAPL for example.  It makes up about 11% of my portfolio and I'm in at a $91 cost basis.

I don't believe it will go that low anytime soon, but I guess you never know.

If it did though, to me if rather add more shares "" at a discount"" than sell I guess.



Anyways the cons I can see is that since its held in taxable, I will incur some short term gains, but that may be better than losing ( maybe temporarily) though some principle amount.

Would someone with a relatively long term horizon need a stop loss?

So do you set it typically above your cost basis or at some number below that where ""you don't want to lose anymore money"" , for example.

Wouldn't most long term buy hold type investors just ride it to the bottom or say 70% of your principle amount or something?

Then if the stop loss does trigger, you have to make the decision when or if to buy back in.  What if it shoots right back up way over your stop loss?

Now you're incurring capital gains plus buying back in higher, so you've lost."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I don't use stop losses. I'm riding or dieing with my investments. I invested in my portfolio because I'm purely confident in it either short term or long term. It's money I can afford to wait until it rebounds if it does. If I see a fluctuation I don't like with a stock I was never confident in I'll take a small loss as quickly as possible before it dips further. 

If I set a stop loss at 20% and it rebounds the next month or three, it's 20% I could have had. 

It makes plenty of sense if you're investing a lot of money on one stock and need cash to reinvest elsewhere but why invest that much to begin with if you weren't able to take a small plunge of say 20%?"
03/15/2021,stocks,Stop loss is another term for loss realizator
03/15/2021,stocks,What I do is set up some gradual stop losses (set up as a an algo). Relatively minor amounts to adjust risk. I almost always buy back at lower values.

03/15/2021,stocks,"I've seen to many flash crashes to be comfortable with stop losses....  I personally simply cash out a portion of the winners to protect profit.  I reinvest the profit in something else, and let the remaining position ride."

03/15/2021,stocks,Yes I do. I set stop losses for long term stocks that have 10%+ return on them. Usually $5 over what I paid for it. I figure if something happens that makes the stock tank that badly then I’ll probably be happy I have those set as it must be pretty serious.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Pros: stop losses

Cons: stop gains"
03/15/2021,stocks,What you want is called a trailing stop loss with a time delay.  Trailing that it follows the stock.  Say it goes up 200 bucks.  You don't want it to drop 205 to sell.  The trailing aspect allows it to follow up to say 400 then when it drops to 390 it sells.   The time delay is the important factor to prevent drops from causing a sell off.  You can say it has to be below x for so long to sell

I'm tempted to just transfer all my positions into VTI and stop paying attention for a few months. While I know this is probably good for my health, I'm behind on all my tech stocks after this correction, so I hate to close those positions right now. I've been selling CCs to help those tech positions, which unfortunately requires more attention to sell them at a good time.

I'm considering the following options:

1) Close my tech positions, accept those loses, move everything to VTI, and check back in a few months.

2) Keep all my positions, but stop selling CCs, and stop paying attention for a few months.

The second option will likely improve my returns, but will require more discipline to not monitor and tweak constantly.

2021-03-15 00:08:32,stocks,"Better to take on debt than to sell off stocks? I first started investing in 2016 with the sole intent of having somewhere to park my money for a chance to grow while waiting for the next big purchase (car/house). No real research other than googling “best etf for 2016/17/18/etc.” When it came time to make the purchase, I’d cash out, and I did that ($30k) in 2018 for a down payment on our first house. 

I’ve since rebuilt my portfolio to $80k and growing, and up until this year my intent in investing remained the same. The plan was that the next time we had to buy a new car, it would be a full cash purchase, or the next time we had to buy a home (military/frequent moves), I’d cash out my portfolio and add it to the equity I’ve built on my current home for an even bigger down payment on the next. And on and on repeating the cycle of rebuilding my brokerage account from scratch with the ultimate goal of as close to full cash purchase as possible on our forever home after my 20 years in the military (in 8-9 years).

I’m wondering if this is a bad idea. My portfolio is up $20K over the last year. When it’s time to look at upgrading one of our cars, for example, is it better to take on a 3% apr car loan than to sell off half of my portfolio? When it comes time for the next house purchase, would it be wise to liquidate everything for as large of a down payment as possible, knowing we very likely won’t be in this next house longer than 5 years? 

Watching my portfolio grow at this rate has really sucked me in to wanting to learn more and more about investing, and a growing part of me wants to keep throwing money into it vs making large down payments."

-selling off now I would lose A LOT of years of compounding. This doesn’t seem like much now but because I’m 29, but taking a few years to build that portfolio back up would significantly reduce my retirement goals.

Here are a few examples of what i mean.

03/15/2021,stocks,"I thought most swing traders rely on technical analysis as its a short term position (days to weeks) where as fundamental analysis is for long term positions. Maybe im wrong or assuming, as ive have only gotten into swing trading recently because i dont care for anyones DD, they all seem like confirmation bias or pumping. I like technical analysis when a stock is showing a pattern to help plan a good entry and potential exit. Use stop loss to protect yourself. After building a watch list of stocks showing patterns in bouncing off supports, you then look at whats soon to be ready for entry, whats the potential profits v losses, and pick the best or most solid/safe. TA only helps you plan your  entry its not going to tell you where the stock will go."

Do u have a recommendation on good reading material?"
03/15/2021,stocks,🙌Say it louder for the people in the back🙌
03/15/2021,stocks,"The analyst recommendations or reports you see are from so-called ""sell-side "" analysts (""buy side"" analysts don't usually make their reports public). Many sell-side analyst work for investment banks which have various companies as clients, so their firm has an interest to place the shares of the company they work with to various buy side funds (the firm is hired by the company for this purpose as an underwriter etc). This tends to create a conflict of interest for analysts covering that company. Investment banks also have an interest that various buy side funds send trades through their trade floor, even when they don't have a direct relationship with the company in question. The sell-side also includes various dealer-brokers who have a similar interest.

So sell-side analyst reports tend to have a positive bias and they are mostly to be taken as a starting point for deeper analysis, i.e. as investment ideas. Part of what junior analysts do is to establish and maintain personal contact with the management of the companies they follow, which allows them access to early information. That is usually valued by buy side funds since working with the analyst's firm allows them access to company management and to that information.

It is natural that analysts from different firms have different appraisals of the same company, since valuing an investment is not an exact science and there are many assumptions going into it. So their reports generally provide a range of opinion.

The standard way for analysts to value a company and make price predictions is to  build a so-called three-statement model and feed it into a DCF model (both constructed  in excel), which allows them to produce a range of valuations and future prices per share depending on various assumptions. They also use relative valuation methods (comparing various ratios to similar companies in the same industry). The end results are ""football field charts"" with various valuation ranges and price predictions and an average resulting from various estimates. These go into their final report together with a summary of the analysis and some discussion of the company's qualitative aspects."
03/15/2021,stocks,">Seems like it should just be math,

It is. But its also based on alot of assumptions and iteration. Which is why its so different for each analyst.

2021-03-14 23:32:34,stocks,"Inflation play Everyone is talking about the best inflation hedges and I was thinking REITs could be the best inflation plays out there. Specifically I was thinking about investing in macerich company. Malls are seriously undervalued as of now. One of the biggest concerns about this company is the debt it has and obviously with inflation debt becomes less of an issue. Mac owns prime real estate and class A malls which is a great asset with inflation because there is only a finite amount of land available. Class A malls mean that these are high valued malls and the land is still valuable because of their location. Obviously malls are on the decline but this is a value play for repurposing their land. Macerich is heavily shorted and the price has been pushed down by shorts. This is not a short squeeze play but a long term play. Macerich is in the works of repurposing their malls to add apartments and medical centers to attract people. Coincidentally closing of malls means less competition for the better malls which macerich owns. I believe that the market thinks commercial real estate in big cities are dead but I just cannot see working from home being as productive as being in an actual office and I believe that the need to meet in person and in cities will still be necessary.

My positions
3 mac calls may 6/18 $14 strike"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Macerich is a deep value play but overhanging factor is their ability to renew their revolver credit facility as they might have breached some debt covenants.

Apparently, they have hired advisor to explore options presumably as one of the lenders is not playing balls.

It will either shoot up if they renew it or shoot down if fails to agree a deal.

I think that is the reason it is trading in range waiting for direction.

Irony is that they have strong cash flows and no chance of default but debt can bring companies to their knees as Buffett says."
2021-03-14 23:24:39,stocks,"I want to like Lemonade LMND - but I just can't. DD, prove me wrong please! I've been a happy customer of lemonade and think they have a great business model acquiring younger people that don't want to interact with people and have an easy and intuitive way to buy renters and homeowners insurance.  Demographics will progress as millennials age. 

I bought lemonade a couple years ago for renters insurance and am now buying my first house and will utilize them for homeowners.  Both times I had GREAT experiences. Easy to interact. No phone calls and they even worked with my lender to show proof of insurance without me really asking.  I was also able to add ring insurance to my renters with relative easy witch is a bit difficult when it comes to valuation and coverage. 

So lemonade dips hard and I'm like go time. I listened to the podcast Dave Lee with the Lemonade CFO and it I like where they were heading and the CEO just recently ""leaked"" that they'd be adding a new product which has to be car insurance.  I like where they are heading BUT...

If you look at the insurance space it is sooo crowded. Additionally if you look at Google's interest overtime  lemonade doesn't come close to the big boys progressive, all state, geico etc. 

 https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en-US&tz=420&geo=US&q=%2Fg%2F11g9q62bm6,%2Fm%2F02r95v,%2Fm%2F032v2q,%2Fm%2F03ct7b,%2Fm%2F03dnbx&sni=3  

Lemonade is still unprofitable for the foreseeable future and while their cost to acquire is much less. I don't think people want to actively switch insurance unless they absolutely have to. Similar to banks it's just a pain in the ass especially if you are tied down with multiple products. This is why the bundle and save is around to make the company/product super sticky and hard to get out of even if you have a bad experience. 

I'd love to hear some counter points because I want to invest in this company due to my experience but there is no moat and I hate how many players with massive ad spend and brand recognition are in the game."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Having been an executive in the property and casualty insurance industry for 25 years, here’s my take. The concept of Lemonade is very strong and quite appealing.  It is actually quite threatening to the “old school” insurance companies out there like AIG, Allstate, etc.  

The key measure of profitability for an insurance company is the Combined Ratio, or CR.  This is the combination of the company’s two primary costs; expenses and losses. Most mature insurance carriers have expense ratios between 30-35%.  It is clear from Lemonades financials that their expense ratio is significantly higher than this. Loss ratios vary widely by line of business and Lemonade’s stands at 70%.  The company I work for had a loss ratio of about 47% last year and a combined ratio of 89%.  This means for ever dollar in premium we netted $.11 in profit which (oddly enough) is a very strong financial result. 

For a carrier to be profitable (and to simplify, excluding any investment income), they must have a CR less than 100%.  Last I looked, Lemonades CR was around 150% and with their 70% loss ratio having been worked down from over 200% near their inception, they have a long long ways to go. And like a marathon, the last stretch is the toughest."

I ended up with Allianz. The process was exactly the same. I filled some form on a website. The website wasn't cool and hip but that's it.

I just don't get the ""But they've got an app!"" argument. Every insurer's got an app."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I bought LMND back in October for like 60$ a share and only sold shares since. I still have a little more than 50% of my original position, but I feel like it has definitely gotten a little pricey.  I know good companies always seem expensive. Still, a few things popped up that were quite worrisome and lead me to sell a few shares.   


For example, the customer growth in Q4 was terrible. Seems like the expansion in Europe does not go as well as planned. Combine that with the chief business development officer selling 13% of his options a few hours before the earnings (the stock dropped 8% iirc) I feel betrayed. There is no way I can react on his selling if the filing is submitted 2 days after the earnings report.   


So yeah, I would call myself a LMND bull, but I am definitely not blind. I think there are better risk-reward opportunities out there, but I also don't want to miss out on the x10 potential if LMND actually disrupts the insurance industry. I call it a hedge against regrets lmao"

I started investing during last Feb when the pandemic hit, which is coincidently when I also learned about options and made a nice 500%+ gain off SPY Puts (Drill team 6) in matter of days which in hindsight was a really stupid play that worked out, beginners luck..

But then I cashed out and missed out the entire tech rally, because I just couldn't guess the direction the market was headed next. I started trading again just a few months ago, mostly swing trading and scalping some gains from WSB frenzy and hype stocks, nothing too crazy tho.

Anyways, I strongly believe that we're in a massive stock bubble, the likes of which we've never seen before. All time retail investor activity, news networks covering stocks 24/7 and the US economy, etc.

I'm curious about some of your financial plans are in terms of investing in the stock market. Are you holding? going cash gang until the storm settles? investing back in a few months when the economy opens back up and the interest rate returns to normal?

I myself, believe the upside is very limited from this point on. I wouldn't mind missing out 10\~20% gains this year if I can avoid losing 30%+ from a major market crash/correction. Just wanted share my view and where I stand. I'd also like to hear what your plans and reasons for such strategy.

As for me, I was thankfully all cash before the last 2 weeks of major correction, and will most likely be holding cash for a while until I see a clear trend, even if I catch the last tail end of it to mitigate my loss potential.

Also- $CODX has earnings in a few weeks and it’s from the best quarter ever thanks to the sales of the other covid tests they sell. Shorts are beginning to cover which shot it up 20% from last weeks opening price. Last I saw though about 90% of shorts still haven’t covered yet.

PCR tests provide results same day...and tell you how contagious you are. There’s more but I’m getting lazy. 

What sets codx apart... they are only test that has gotten approval or submitted request for EUA from the FDA. I don’t think there will be any other pcr test to get fda approval. And they also own a patent on their testing technology... co primers. Google it. Their covid test will detect influenza a, b, and covid. And trials or whatever have shown it is consistently accurate, which is big deal bc most pcr tests come back as false positives/negatives.

2021-03-14 21:58:06,stocks,"Tesla FSD: Am I the only one who thinks this way? First of all, I do not own put options on Tesla, nor do I short the stock. The following thoughts came to me when a friend told me that he felt screwed by Tesla and Elon:

In recent weeks, it has been reported that Tesla admitted in an email exchange with a Californian authority that FSD is only Level 2 and that this will not change in the near future. For several years now, you can pay 7500€ (sorry, I'm European) for ""Full Potential for Autonomous Driving"". Since Elon Musk has been announcing for years that autonomous driving would be available soon (millions of robotaxis; level 5 at the end of the year), many customers (like my friend)  naturally buy this to be able to be there right from the start.

But now Tesla admits in these emails that this function will not work in the near future and that FSD is only level 2. Many people bought this system for a lot of money because Elon keeps promising that it will be available soon, although he knows very well that Tesla is still far away from it.

I would honestly feel cheated if I had believed Elon and therefore spent such a large sum of money on a driving assistant, believing it would be a fully autonomous car next year.

It's one thing not to take things too seriously, or sometimes to create somewhat high expectations, but in this case the customer is being actively deceived. It is not ok that Elon makes his customers pay for something that is not yet in sight by convincing them that it will be next year.

What do you think?"
03/15/2021,stocks,The application said any updates beyond level 2 would go through their process for quality control (which is happening). Elon is fighting regulation and it is possible that they are taking an incremental approach with regulators. It is an interesting development since he has been very clear that full autonomy is the goal and he has said they will get there through vision and sensors (without LIDAR). Really interested to see how FSD rollout goes.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think it is only a matter of time before class action law suits are filed.  People have bought cars, paid for full self driving, and years later when it is time to replace the vehicle still don't have FSD.

Tesla will probably offer the lawyers a fat payoff and give people rebates on the purchase of a new Tesla.  That is how these things usually end up.  

If this had happened two or so years ago then it might have affected Tesla, but the company now has the capital reserves to make it a non-issue."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Tesla is really behind on the autonomous car tech. But in the end it doesn't matter because fully autonomous cars are not coming maybe for decades. It's beyond current machine learning techniques. It pretty much hit the wall in 2017. Uber just sold their autonomous car division and it seems like a lot of people are giving up on fully self driving cars. Drive assistance is all we will get for the foreseeable future.

I would say the Elon today is happy with how far its progressing though. Tell your friend that his car can be updated to include these features in the future, so Elon didn't lie, he exaggerated. The rest of society still needs to catch up with Tesla anyways.

03/15/2021,stocks,"It's really unsafe to make blanket statements as you are doing. In most countries in the world, US produced chicken can't be imported as our factory produced chicken are considered food safety hazards. These extraordinary recommendations that exist in the US, like not washing chicken, are part of our local culture of unsafe factory farming of poultry. The unsanitary production of poultry in the US, combined with the production practices of dipping poultry in industrial disinfectants like chlorine and/or high levels of arsenic, can make it unhealthy to NOT wash US produced chicken. Washing off the filth and chemicals is certainly not doing nothing. 

It's just general advice given to the public to not wash chicken because otherwise you'd have to explain to people how to not spray chicken water everywhere, and to keep their counters and sinks clean, which is a very low level of personal responsibility and low level of expectation for average American consumers' personal competence. 

Just because the USDA and most people have a very low level of expectations for Americans having personal competence in handling chicken, doesn't mean that people who are competent can't manage the task. And for people who can handle the job competently, it's safer to wash the chicken from the standpoint of all the chemicals, adulterants and other industrial contaminants that exist on raw US chicken from factory farms. If you can manage food handling competently and you source your chicken from a good supply chain that doesn't use factory farm processes and has better meat safety practices in their production lines, it's a very different level of personal responsibility than what the average US consumer is held to by public health officials"

They also have $60.00 $70.00 and so on which makes sense but why less than the current market price?

Let's say you find a deep ITM option that has a Delta of 0.6(or $60)
That means that for every dollar the stock increases, the value of the option increases by $60. Essentially you're getting a 60 to 1 leverage, for the price of the premium you paid for the option call. It's like owning 60 shares for a much cheaper price than actually buying 60 shares"

2021-03-14 21:16:06,stocks,"My Take on Semiconductors - TSMC DD Reports of the [semiconductor shortage](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/538474-biden-to-sign-executive-order-addressing-chip-supply-chain-shortage) in early February had me take deeper look into the industry. Wanted to share my thoughts with the sub!

The market is essentially split into two parts. Companies like AMD, NVIDIA, and QCOM design chips. Companies like TSM, UMC, and Samsung produce them. The shortage here is exclusively on the production side. We can't make chips fast enough and many industries (car makers in particular) are complaining really loudly about the shortage. Some of this is self-inflicted and short-term. Automakers cut back production forecasts because of COVID and rely heavily on just-in-time production supply chains to cut back on costs. This means that they were largely caught with their pants down when demand started to pick back up. 

There are strong longer-term trends driving the shortage here too. Cars are getting more complicated and EVs need more/better hardware/chips. Right now, auto-makers are generally looking at 14nm chips ([Tesla's MCU2](https://onlyusedtesla.com/teslas-media-control-unit-mcu1-vs-mcu2/) is based on the Intel AtomE8000). This is an older process node, Intel was [releasing 14nm chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_processors#Skylake_microarchitecture_(6th_generation)) in 2015. I think ultimately, car production is going to have to be cut back, prices are going to go up, automakers are going to rush to lock in future supply, and producers (not designers) are going to benefit.

The producer market is really interesting. It takes a LONG time to spin up a new factory (fab). Generally speaking, it's 3-4 years before a factory goes from planning to production. We can't really throw money at this problem to fix this in the short-term. The producer market is also very clearly split into two parts: those who can make 10nm chips and below and those who can't. This [chart](https://s3.i-micronews.com/uploads/2021/03/ILLUS_HIGH-PERFORMANCE-PACKAGING_Overview_SemiconIndustry_YOLE_March2021.jpg) breaks it down at a high level. There are only three companies that can make chips that we'll want in the next 5 years (Intel, Samsung, TSMC), and one of them can't really do it. Intel has gotten 10nm reasonably figured [out but can't break 7.](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-announces-delay-to-7nm-processors-now-one-year-behind-expectations) They've given up the production race and [plan on outsourcing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/intel-talks-with-tsmc-samsung-to-outsource-some-chip-production) their future designs to TSMC and Samsung. 

Between Samsung and TSM, TSM is investing much more aggressively for the future. They've already planning on building out a 5nm production line in Arizona for [\~20K wafers](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/tsmc-increasing-spending-arizona-chip-factory-35b-2021-03-09/) which should increase their global production by 20%. There are [rumors](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-arizona-fab-potential-expansion) that they are expanding production to 100K wafers which would double their global 5nm capacity. Samsung is still figuring out [where they want to build](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16483/samsung-in-the-usa-a-17-billion-usd-fab-by-late-2023). It also looks like [TSM](https://www.pcgamer.com/tsmc-3nm-2021-apple-chips/) is going to beat [Samsung](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/samsung-beginning-3nm-chip-mass-production-2022-2020-11-19/) to 3nm by almost a full year. 

That said, the stock is not cheap. It's got a PE ratio of 53. But the steep technological moat, aggressive investment in future production, and long-term demand increases (cars/computers/phones aren't getting any simpler or less popular) makes me confident they'll grow into their price. 

TLDR: We need more chips. TSM makes the best chips."
03/15/2021,stocks,"It is strange that people seem to insist in the value play of companies like AMD/Nvidia over Intel, when OPs post is all about the limited supply chokehold that these newer process nodes. While TSMC doesn't suffer, AMD/Nvidia's sales are bottlenecked by the allocation arranged with TSMC and limited by the fact that many companies are vying for a slice of that manufacturing capacity, whereas intel is both the designer and manufacturer. When there just simply aren't enough CPUs available from AMD, regardless of what nm they are at, OEMs and consumers have to go with intel and they can set the price."

03/15/2021,stocks,"The chips needed in autos right now are not cutting edge. It’s almost commodities and OEMs basically stick with the same semi because change costs will hurt already tough margins.

03/15/2021,stocks,Lol TSMC is gonna single handedly carry that entire countries GDP and probably raise Taiwan to a globally respected country. Pretty amazing for a company that only a few years ago was a small and generally a disregarded company in the lithography race. Intel was still making 14nm viable and it seemed they couldn't possibly lose their lead to such a small company. Funny how that worked out. It seems like while everyone else was concerned about maximizing profits and lowering capital requirements TSMC was balls to the wall.
03/15/2021,stocks,Yea imma get me some TSM leaps. Just bought AMD LEAPS because their heavily undervalued imo.

My money in specifically on Infineon this year: they have a large new fab opening up here in the summer when no other power electronics fabs are slated to open. This should allow them to gobble up market share and orders.

I saw the price they were trading at which basically the market was pricing them for bankruptcy and everyone was crapping on this company. A company with great cash flow, growing earnings, huge development in the AI field, and self driving technology. I bought a ton of shares at $48.00 and it was the best decision I made in my entire life.

2021-03-14 21:01:04,stocks,"I am considering researching a moving average technical strategy. Hello all,

I am interested in researching and conducting a moving average study on specifically Tesla. 

My plan is to go through every moving average, on the 1min - daily timeframe, and back about 100-200 days.

I would count then, each time the price approaches the MA line, how many times it reacts( shows some resistance against) , bounces ( reverses trend, atleast short terms for a playable trade) and ignores( just passes through) I would do this for every time frame.

Afterwards, I would calculate the percentage of times price reacted and bounced. Obviously then I would use the MA lines with the highest percent chance of bouncing to make a trade.

What do you guys think.

I plan on starting at 9ma count by 2 or 3 up to 50,
Then continue by 5 or 10 till I reach the 200ma 

This is because I don’t want to do every single number and as you get into higher numbers the lines start to move less and less apart.

What do you guys think, is this a good idea. Has it already been done? Is they’re a faster way to do this?

I am asking because I just don’t want to waste all of my time, if someone tells else did it, or it’s just a dumb idea I won’t even bother.

Thanks"
2021-03-14 21:00:46,stocks,"How to invest $180k with mental block from huge losses Long story short, I was stupid enough to sell at the bottom of March last year and is still in 100% cash. The cash had been sitting in my brokerage earning 0% interest for the past year. I am in Canada and the cash are sitting in a RRSP hence i did not transfer it into a interest bearing account because I wanted the cash to remain liquid in a event of a crash. I kept hoping the market would crash so I could buy back in cheaper and that has cost me 2 years of my salary in missed gains. Seeing these gigantic rallies every day I am getting serious FOMO but is also conflicted as buying back in now will be locking in my losses. I dont think I have the mental strength to hold on to all cash much longer and I know I shouldn't of tried to time the market in the first place but I feel I'm in too deep at this point. I feel like doing a lump sum and be done with it  so i can be free from my mental anguish but with markets at ATH i am still somewhat hesitant, I don't want to FOMO in at the top and see my holdings crash. Would DCA be a better option? 

100K of this money is actually for my parents' retirement. They will be retiring within 5-8 years. I sold their 2% MER mutual fund last year and wanted to buy back the ETF equivalent but because of my greediness I wanted to time the bottom and to buy in cheaper and the market just kept shooting up and i never bought in. The mutual fund allocation was 60/40 equity/fixed income and I was thinking to mirror that but seeing how much bonds are taking a beating and with potential further increases in interest in the near future I'm not sure if bonds are a good idea. I don't think I'm comfortable in going with an all equity allocation either due to my parent's short time horizon, can anyone suggest some alternatives?

I know i fucked up huge and probably shouldn't be doing DIY investing. But please, I am already feeling dead inside. Missing the greatest bull market in history will most likely haunt me for the remainder of my life.  I will never touch the holdings again once fully invested. Would just like some advice on how to put my parent's money back into the market."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Don't beat yourself up, we all make mistakes, here are my suggestions for you:

&#x200B;

1. Don't try to time the market. For the long run, always be a bull. Learn from [Bob](https://prosperion.us/commentary/meet-bob-worlds-worst-market-timer/).
2. I suggest you look into /r/personalfinancecanada. It's probably more relevant to your situation than a stocks sub.
3. Historical data shows that a lump sum investment is usually better than DCA. But I think the psychological benefits of DCA are more important in your case. Regardless of how you intend to schedule your DCA, you should start now.
4. You did not mention where your RRSP is. Transferring your account may require some fees, so either move all of it now, or stay with it until you finish your DCA. If you want to avoid commissions, you can use Questrade (for all ETFs) or Wealthsimple Trade (for all Canadian stocks), and they will also reimburse the transfer fees for you.
5. For a 60/40 allocation, the easiest solution would be to hold an all-in-one ETF such as VBAL or XBAL. Check out [Canadian couch potato](https://canadiancouchpotato.com/).
6. You may also want to take a look into robo-advisors. Wealthsimple Invest seems to be very popular with redditors. It's a bit more expensive than the ETFs above, but it's probably easier to DCA into with recurring deposits. This is probably less relevant to you right now since you already have your funds in your current RRSP.

Good luck!"

03/15/2021,stocks,"Sorry for your loss.

When life gives you suffering, the best you can do is to correctly learn the lessons those situations give you.  Eventually life doesn't give you suffering any more if you've gained enough experience.

Imo a good lesson from this one is:  Investing is only buying, never selling.  The second you're selling you're trading.  There are exceptions of course, like profile adjustments, and retirement when you stop investing and you start selling.

>I was thinking to mirror that but seeing how much bonds are taking a beating and with potential further increases in interest in the near future I'm not sure if bonds are a good idea.

Bonds are not a good idea.  They never have been, even during the great depression.  For investing go 100% in index funds like SPY, QQQ, or broad index funds like international ones like the ones mentioned over at /r/Bogleheads.  Set it and forget it.

03/15/2021,stocks,"The past is in the past and you have to find a way to look forward. If this has reached the point that it affects your mentality and social/professional life, consider a form of therapy. Now on managing the cash, I would segregate the two portions: your parents' potion and your portion. For your parents' portion, I would take a conservative approach, maybe 35% stocks and 65% bonds. The stocks would be in index ETFs such as SPY in addition to high dividend paying ETFs. For your portion, I would follow a tier system. What this means is that you divide your $80K into, say, 5 tiers where each tier is $17K. You can enter the market right away with tier 1 worth of $17K. Diversification is a good approach such as buying ETFs, value, growth, different sectors, large cap, mid cap, etc. For the following 4 tiers, you can take your time and wait for dips (either broad market dips or individual stocks dips that you had eyed). And you can add up to your existing holdings or start new positions."

Note that USD has declined 6% vs CAD since last summer. If you have CAD, now is a good time to convert (using Norbert's gambit) and invest in US stocks. Later, when CAD declines, you can convert back."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Look, it sounds like you don't really have the mindset for what you're doing. There's no shame in that and I think it's commendable that you're being upfront about this whole thing. 

Your odds of ""winning back"" what you've lost are low. This sounds like you're not looking to invest or save up, it sounds like you're gambling. Gambling is fine, but it isn't fine when it's other people's money.

Don't beat yourself up about FOMO, the markets will continue to go up and down and stock picking isn't easy in any market. 

Even if you got advice here for where to put a sum of money like that, I would advise against taking it and instead either make monthly contributions to a basket of well-diversified ETF's or then you contact a professional and have them handle this. 

FOMO is a pretty bad reason to buy stock - it really is. The best reason to buy stock is that you have a well thought-out hypothesis as to why a business may be undervalued or that it has some potential. It sounds to me like you didn't really have those good reasons to get into the market in the first place, and it doesn't sound like you have a reason now either."

I didn’t get back in when I should have, but I did get back in and my portfolio is getting marginally bigger. I have a while to go too until retirement, and I figure the gains that I lost out financially translate into being a smarter, wiser and riskier investor than I was before. 

I’m also not managing anyone else’s money, just mine. To OP, I’d get your parents’ money into a fund managed by someone else, and really start having painfully practical conversations with them about what their retirement might look like with limited funds."

2021-03-14 20:58:54,stocks,"If given a stock as a gift, recipient only pays taxes on gains from when they received the share. Why don't people do this to avoid taxes? This is a serious question. I'm not suggesting people commit tax fraud but this seems like an easy loophole. I'm not from the US and I'm not familiar with the tax code but I'm genuinely curious. You could invest for your child's education, then gift them the shares and have them sell it right away to pay for their tuition with minimal taxes. It can be done with any family members as well.

Could someone who is experienced with this explain if it's actually possible?


Edit: So I misunderstood. You don't pay gift taxes as long as it's less than 15k per year. Anything on top of that must be reported and goes to your lifetime allowance of up to 11 million tax free but anything under 15k doesn't need to be reported at all and doesn't affect the 11 million limit. However, you still pay taxes on the gains from the stock if you sell it as if you were the one who bought it all along.

Also 68 million shares shorted on Friday alone. I believe after the close it went to 550,000 short shares available to lend so they had started to cover.

2021-03-14 20:14:10,stocks,"SUMO - Sumo Logic Inc. SUMO Logic Inc: SUMO Logic went public in September for $22.00 a share. The stock dipped as low $16.71 on October 26th, 2021, before their first earnings report on December 7th (Posted in detail below), after which shares pumped to a high of $46.37 by February 8th. SUMO’s analysts ratings are excellent, analyst coverage is largely solid, and despite offering softer than expected guidance amid their most recent earnings, little has changed as far as their prospects for high growth. Of course, I see many companies this earnings season claiming “uncertainty” as a result of underlying economic conditions. More often than not I assess they’re simply managing expectations so that they can continue overperforming analysts predictions.

SUMO guidance expects between $53.2M & $54.2M in revenue for the quarter ending this upcoming April, a return of 13-15% and an adjusted loss of 12 cents a share. Consensus analysts estimates called for $53.4M and a loss of 14 cents per share. Overall they expect to grow in revenue between $231-$235M by JAN2022, an increase of 14-16% YoY, while expecting an EPS loss of 40-50 cents a share (I believe this an extreme low ball assessment). Analysts expect $234.1M and a YoY adjusted loss of 51 cents per share by JAN2022. In all they’re beating their earnings and growing slightly faster than analysts expectations, although the street seems to expect much higher growth. And of course, so do I. In FY 2018 they had $68M in revenue. In FY 2019 they grew to $103M in revenue, and by FY 2020, $155.06M. In the year ending in JAN2021 they gained $202.6M.

I do not believe, given this company’s record and clientele, that they’re going to grow less than their expected rate. And while some critics believe that this space is overcrowded, I look through their growing list of customers and see some solid names. This is not likely to slow for SUMO any time soon and I am optimistic that their revenue may grow well beyond their YoY guidance. In short, little has changed to justify such a massive over-reaction (Remember they reported amid the market correction time frame) to their most recent earnings beat, and with COVID coming to an end, I expect revenue growth to be much higher than their lowball guidance. I see SUMO stock as oversold, I assess this three month low as a bullish set up, and I think it a great dip buying opportunity that only comes around once in a blue moon. This is why I am long SUMO, and as a result, I have set up a covered strangle to take advantage of recent volatility. If you’re into stock I recommend investing safely and slowly as recommend in THIS STRATEGY.

His overall theory is that the casual ""dumb"" investor has great insights into which companies can multiply their value in a relatively short time period. He generally recommends investing in companies that you like and understand. With that said, the company should be profitable or have a clear path to profitability and future growth. You don't want to throw money at dumpster fires just because they have a cool product. 

I recommend learning how to read a balance sheet and understanding the various multiples (PE, P/S, P/FCF) etc. If you can look at the valuation and financials over time it can help you determine a price you are comfortable paying.

It was very strange viewing money like this, like having a big chunk of my portfolio in a losing position was what I had to endure in order to be successful in this market. It makes you feel like the actual value of an investment can change in a drastic and fickle way. Instead of holding my contracts, I'd sell them before they could get to a 30% or so loss and invest them in a different opportunity. Then one week, those couple of thousand dollar red days just kept on happening, and the green days didn't show up. Every morning I would wake up to another 15% portfolio loss.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Agreed with much if the aforementioned. I am very surprised to not see any mention of NOC or KTOS though. I'm optimistic that both will be added to the soon to come space ETFs, unlike the likes of LMT, RTX, LHX"
03/15/2021,stocks,It's hard to go broke selling weapons to Washington.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Boeing is good because they also have the commercial airline division.

Raytheon is also great because they have Pratt and Whitney and Collins Aerospace.  Both help in case defense spending gets cut."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Overall, I think the risk of the United States getting into a serious conflict is overhyped, if we look at recent and on-going conflicts, they are self-contained with major powers playing arms dealer to further their agenda with air power as the most important element of modern conflict.

The Azerbaijani-Armenia highlighted the importance of drone technology, air power and precision air strikes, with that in mind, I think Raytheon with platforms such as the tomahawk cruise missile, General Dynamics with the F-16 widely employed by the US and international clients such as Turkey, or Textron, manufacturer of the Cessna 172 (the most common trainer in the world), are all reasonably strong ideas."
03/15/2021,stocks,Shhh let me build my position more first
03/15/2021,stocks,"Nancy Pelosi took a $1M position in Crowdstrike, so I'd bet on them."
03/15/2021,stocks,No
03/15/2021,stocks,You should research the company a bit more
03/15/2021,stocks,Been in KTOS since they were like $6 a share. Their heavy investment in drones has helped them grow and maybe become a possible target for acquisition by one of the big defense companies. I’m still holding for the long term.
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you hold morally questionable stocks, at the very least exercise your shareholder voting rights using your conscience."
03/15/2021,stocks,"You also have to keep in mind the defense industry is deliberately spread out over the whole U.S.  This is so nearly every state will lose jobs if defense is cut.  Cutting defense is a political hot potato. 

With a cold war with China developing and the power mongers in both parties calling to reestablish U.S. commitments in the world, the defense industry looks good over the next ten to twenty years.  Since we cannot beat China with numbers, that means planes, missiles, and drones."
03/15/2021,stocks,"the point is that its a 50B cap so no amount of pumping on reddit would move it, so there's no reason anybody would be ""shilling"" it on reddit."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I just signed up on [Stocktwits.com](https://Stocktwits.com) and it is super easy to follow stock news there, a lot of people sharing information, and easy to use"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Honestly, wsb was great before it ballooned up. There was a redditor who mentioned the impact of the Argentinan stocks for an extremely likely socialist victory by Fernandez, which was virtually uncovered in US mainstream media outlets. Most importantly, IV were very low for argentian stocks like GGAL, and one could have made a very good return had he/she bought DTE 0 puts right before the election."

03/15/2021,stocks,"I hate to be ""that guy"" on this sub but with stimulus checks flooding the market retail investors are going to pump and dump the crap out of GME again.  It's been written on the wall for weeks."
03/15/2021,stocks,Any chance the 10yr bond yield will rise to 2% this week? That'd be pretty sweet.
03/15/2021,stocks,Amazing 🙏🙏🙏

03/15/2021,stocks,"My family has taken all the precautions and we really dont go anywhere. Even for groceries we use insta cart almost all the time.


With that being said, i think you are really under estimating just how many people will over compensate for going out once things open up. And under estimate how many women/men dont like to cook or are not good at it and want to get back to eating out. 

I will still probably avoid most of those stocks, but it wouldnt surprise me if they put up huge numbers"
03/15/2021,stocks,I don’t think that’s true in the US. Most adults that want to be vaccinated will be able to do so by mid July.
03/15/2021,stocks,I've been trading AAL CCL and NCLH since April 2020. I've been holding them usually anywhere from a few days to a month. So yes swing trading them. Currently have 100 of each from a few weeks ago from the big Thur Fri correction.

03/15/2021,stocks,"> Cruse lines are still way off their highs... whereas much of tech is at new highs. There is a lot more relative upside for these cruise lines.

03/15/2021,stocks,"Yea seriously.

&#x200B;

Oil was the most mother fucking obvious trade in the entire world last year and 99% of Reddit was  pretending oil was dead. It's sad, but I think they actually believed it.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile you and I were salivating all over when oil hit -$20/bbl.

&#x200B;

I bought OXY at $10, Southwest at $27, and OVV at $4. The lowest gainer for me was Southwest, which has only doubled.

&#x200B;

OXY is at 300% for me and OVV is at 400%. And oil is headed higher due to a possible commodity supercycle and inflation will also help. I wouldn't be surprised if I finish out the year with OXY at 600% and OVV at 500%."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Much of the developing world has done pretty good with the virus. Luckily, they are in hot, humid environments, and there is also some very preliminary research which shows they are a little more resistant to viruses like COVID-19 in India."

03/15/2021,stocks,I have to admit I overlooked oil because of the tech hype. Is OXY still worth getting into now? Any potential for steep drops in the price this year?

03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm happy.  We'll see. I know I'M not going in any restaurants or movie theaters any time soon! Not going on any planes or ""vacations"" at resorts either!"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Depends how confident you are calling the top! 

(For reference - I’m not investing, or planning to, in SQQQ)"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Okay, so we’ve established the only way to profit  in this market is to sell while the price is going up.

That’s the definition of a bubble. (Ie where higher prices don’t factor in lower rates of return)."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'm sure there will be drops tbh. I think there has to be a correction in oil soon, it's been basically been an uninterrupted bull run since November."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Oh Microsoft. I love my games, xbox and PC, when I saw what they did with Bethesda and EA I was like waow!
As a business that is impressive, Microsoft was criticized for not having exclusive, with the thought ""just get a PC and buy a PS5""
Their announcement for the inclusion of all the studios under Game Pass Ultimate was awesome.

This gives Microsoft the possibility of taking the lead on the gaming industry through GamePass Ultimate (Gaming Netflix) which supports obviously Windows PC, also mobile.

Gaming industry is just getting bigger and bigger, Google tried to get some cake but couldn't.

As a costumer I ain't going anywhere"
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah I'll hold off on investing in SQQQ until we get a rapid spike in treasury yields again.
03/15/2021,stocks,Is this the first time you've ever heard of buy low sell high?
03/15/2021,stocks,"It’s a weird one - I am yet to be convinced that treasury yields (which will drag down the price of equity, for sure) are enough to cause a full on crash (which historically tends to happen with no real catalyst).

If you’re interested I would highly recommend reading this article, as well as some of Jeremy Grantham’s (GMO) latest articles.

03/15/2021,stocks,Serious question: How do you know DFV sold his options?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Sorry, I'm kinda new to this, how can you tell it was him specifically as opposed to anyone else? Couldn't someone have held the same options and sold?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Hopefully he did, would love to see him clear 40 million from this. He seems like a good guy. People should realize he won’t hold forever and he shouldn’t have to just for memes."
03/15/2021,stocks,"If it looks like a penis with no balls on the 6 month chart, that's a hard pass Bro."
03/15/2021,stocks,I read an article saying there was concern about interest rates but idk if that will come into play long term. They're only like 5 dollars more than they were before announcing crushing earnings so...that does make me think it is undervalued.  Other stocks go up higher based on like 10% increase so idk
03/15/2021,stocks,For CCL I’ll continue to sell puts on it until it’s at a price I’m more comfortable with owning it at (probably sub $20). The latest news that it’s going to take at least 2 more years to get to normal probably means the reopening boom they saw the last few weeks will pop.
03/15/2021,stocks,Some say the travel comeback is already priced in and we wont see much of an increase until earnings reports get gud
03/15/2021,stocks,"You gotta calm down, my friend. I got sucked into that 'i could've saved my own life with gme if I had only yolod back then, so let's find the next big winner to get rich quick"" too. After a month of chasing the next thing, I feel like I'm barely ahead. By the time you hear about something  it's almost too late and squeezes are things you shouldn't rely on. Gme had over 100% short float. The stuff you're talking about barely has 40 something. You'll get a RKT spike but it won't be anything like gme. Be careful with penny stocks too. Esp if theres a fee attached. 

Basically, I'm saying you're gonna put yourself into the red if you're not careful and rn you don't sound careful but idk neither did the wsb fools. 

If things don't look up soon I'm just investing 1000 in stocks likely to go up 10%. That's 100 in profit. Sell that and get another stock likely to go up 10%. Now, I've made 210 off that 1000 being a safe asshole. Repeat and repeat. Idk if I have that kind of willpower tho"
03/15/2021,stocks,The penny stocks subreddit might be able to help you with what your asking.

03/15/2021,stocks,"You kidding? You're not a shill for doing the common sense thing all investors do. Holding while a stock crashes is normally the dumbest thing ever. Most people who do that could've only dreamed it would go back up. 

But I guess this is an alt reality or something"
03/15/2021,stocks,"GME has no long term upside with it's current price. It's not a growth stock, it's a meme stock that will sink back to reality. The reality is they're a failing brick and mortar that exists on the mercy of the 3 manufacturers and a handful of software companies, and they've already ceded the digital market to better run companies. 
And if it doesn't crash in due time, that just means that the market is far overvalued and everything will crash. Fuck gamestop (as a holding investment)."

It was started by people who started following steel in december based on a post by u/vitocorlene

You will want to do your own DD, but look at his original post. He basically goes into deep detail about what you are saying in your comments. He thinks steel will explode this year. MT is the biggest money maker but CLF is a great play for american steel"
03/15/2021,stocks,True dat. Oil prices are high too right now and that's entirely due to supply and demand. There's lots of that going around.
03/15/2021,stocks,"For $12, there are a total of 533 positions. He holds 500 of those. $12 positions were traded 1500 times Friday. 33 positions not held by him isn't gonna be traded around 50 times each"

03/15/2021,stocks,You're right Bro! There are big baggers everyday for somebody. There are NO once in a lifetime deals.
03/15/2021,stocks,Appreciate the reply lad but I’ve tried and haven’t had any luck as of yet
03/15/2021,stocks,Bullish in the sense that it might get pumped again... Not bullish as an actual case for growth.
03/15/2021,stocks,"$347.51 max in Jan, hit $340 and still going up on 3/10 before it was halted and started back up at $203.50. Thinking about jumping in mon before stimulus rush and out by fri, not really sure how I feel about that though. Definitely gambling, not investing. Looking close at PLUG, PLTR, ABNB and open to suggestions."
03/15/2021,stocks,This is sooo wrong lmaoooo. Ryan Cohen is on board. And best believe he’s gonna do everything in his power to make gme succeed. At this point gme is a meme and has gained a rabid fan base with a lot of money to blow. Literally look at the chart atm. They tried to tank the price down from 340 to 170 and failed recently. If Ryan Cohen becomes Ceo and announces he owns like 25% of gme. That will be the catalyst for the squeeze and it’s very likely he will. I can see gme well staying around 200$ a share after the squeeze happens. Ryan Cohen is literally in the best position possible to make gme succeed.
03/15/2021,stocks,He asked for a high growth potential stock!!! NOT a long term holding stock- whatever your personal opinion that’s exactly what I gave him!!!
03/15/2021,stocks,From an actual logical standpoint it really makes no difference it doesn’t effect market cap but in today’s market you can almost throw out all logical valuations.  I think it’ll have a negative effect making the stock appear expensive and it creates a larger upside and profitability potential for shorting
03/15/2021,stocks,What account do you have? TD wouldn't let me do trails on GME a few days ago but did let me in january.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I can, I just set order expiration to ext-am."
03/15/2021,stocks,"If that were true, people would've copied his portfolio that was mentioned in many articles and from what I can see, wsb gives zero shits about them."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Ah right, guess that makes sense. Thanks"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I totally agree but it might take 2 years to beat down all that debt, get out from under interest payments, and get revenue back to normal. That's possibly what they mean. Even if covid gets better and lockdowns vanish, many people were out of work and struggling, and may not have the funds to travel until winter and that's not popular cruise time"
03/15/2021,stocks,I know there’s pent up demand to get back to sailing but when it’s Carnival’s own CEO saying it will take 2 years it’s hard to dismiss that. There’s too many moving parts with each state and country having their own restrictions.
03/15/2021,stocks,"If you're that poor, you're not going to pay anything for health insurance. And if your meds at that expensive, they're gonna pay for most of it.  I technically haven't paid for health insurance for years. This year I'm paying 100 a month bc I didn't pick a cheaper plan and I'm poor."
03/15/2021,stocks,"I feel terrible for people that bought gme at 300 the first time around. Hell, id feel bad for them now. I'd feel bad for someone who bought at 200 whose hoping it's gonna change their life. People were saying the spent their disability check, their wife's money, their kids tuition, a few months rent, their parents retirement,  idk if any of it is true but if it is ....ugh"
03/15/2021,stocks,"Agreeed

Around the same time and on the same day gme went down from 340 to 190, an otc oil stock went from 0.02 to 0.25 and then 0.9 the next day!"
03/15/2021,stocks,"I have no idea how high it will go when people keep buying and there's the other side creating FTD's at the same time. When that happens, the price can go in an infinite squeeze. There was a video I watched that explains what happens when there are more FTD's than outstanding; it's an outrageous effect that can blow up any time."
03/15/2021,stocks,Some people can't tell the difference.
03/15/2021,stocks,"No one definitively knows peak, but once it crosses the utterly absurd high mark might as well just exit and enjoy it.

If you own a stock with no merit above 10 bucks and it's at 300, you sell."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Love ABNB and their future. Have experienced the company myself. My fiancé and I absolutely love it. The stays, the price, and the activities they had pre-COVID."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Idk. I think travel stocks would be good right now but on the med research front PASG got fast tracked for FDA approval, and IMRA had an absurd price target by analysts, like 300 to 400% increase. I think I'm out of the PLTR game. It and BB seem like long holds tho. If I get back to work I'll probably drop some money in them and forget about it. I only ever read good things about investing in abnb. But it's also something that may or may not get going for awhile. I'm still in FSR and some battery companies so idk if I'll get into plug too or go back to an etf."
03/15/2021,stocks,"A high stock price due to squeezes and desperate investors isn't ""succeeding""."
03/15/2021,stocks,"But it's not high growth potential. It might be a long long term hold but it literally shouldn't be the price it is now under normal circumstances. The only way they're going to grow is by closing down stores. If you have it, hold if you will, but if you're thinking of buying in now and telling me it's cuz it's a growth stock then no. If you buy in now you are gambling."
03/15/2021,stocks,"it isnt a real stock, its more of a short term play."
03/15/2021,stocks,Every day? Has this worked out for you. I was also thinking about doing this and noticed a spike premarket everyday but I tried one day and it just happened to be flat that day.
03/15/2021,stocks,True. Thats what i thinks gonna hold it back if any. Mainly government trying to keep control and scaring the crap out of folks over new mutations..  i did make good on those last year when covid hit. I bought. Sold januaryish. Will keep grabbing a few here and there....
03/15/2021,stocks,"I think across the reopening trade there is a lot of “under promise to over deliver” after the disaster that was “one month away from back to normal” this time last year.

There are a lot of unknowns from how long vaccines are effective to developing herd immunity to Covid variants that requires avoiding firm language at the moment."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Yeah but after that, putting  a 100 grand in a Roth IRA or something would be pretty swank"
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah but it has potential to impact the market negatively and I'm sure wsb doesn't give a shit but yeah
03/15/2021,stocks,I think people will be ready to get out and go after this past year and they beat the heck out of a hotel.
03/15/2021,stocks,That’s your opinion...you have to ask yourself why is it the price it is now? Why has it’s gone up so much? How much is there left for it to grow? 30%? 40% - 50%? 100-200%? Whatever it is you will get much better growth in that than in apple or something else in the next month or so! He’s looking for HIGH GROWTH POTENTIAL and again that’s what I gave him and I also said do your own DD. You have your own opinion and that’s ok! Just don’t berate mine. Thanks
03/15/2021,stocks,"Trading volume is high when the market opens, but you gotta figure out what way the stock is going! Which is really hard to do!"
03/15/2021,stocks,Yes. Buy at close and sell by 11am. Obviously you time it to take profit and on some days I regret getting out to early but Overall it tends to pop up in the morning then get ladder attacked around 1030-11am.
03/15/2021,stocks,"I guess, but you're not gonna get an echo chamber like you would in wsb. Many people here simply know what is going on and are aware when imagination and assumptions are being used to fill in the gaps."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Okay, but I have real reason to believe it's current valuation is not it's real valuation and eventually that corrects and also it's not even the most shorted stock anymore lol. What reason do you have to believe it has all this growth potential at all?

I didn't intend to berate yours. I disagreed. Didn't mean for it to come off that way."

03/15/2021,stocks,Idk. Buy/sell volume? But that can change hours later. It just works when you're trying to see what it'll do within 15 min.
03/15/2021,stocks,"How? What he does in his 9 to 5 has no bearing on whether or not he encouraged people to buy GME on Reddit or YouTube. That is an absurd leap in logic. Again, show me a comment or video where he asked or encouraged people to buy GME. You should at least provide evidence for your accusations. But you can't because it's not there. Tell me, if DFV is guilty here, how does CNBC get away with what they do everyday? Keep bagholding and pray for a class action lawsuit to go through, I guess."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Objectively speaking, this is legally like someone posted a pic of themselves eating a burger and people were like ""Wow, that looks tasty. I want one"" and they all go buy one. 

Legally, this is like decades ago, your neighbor came back from the Klondike with gold and you were like ""holy shit, I want gold too"" and join in everyone else in the gold rush. Some people get frost bite. Some people get rich too. Some find nothing. Some people die. You neighbor didn't tell people to go up there. He simply found gold and then other people found gold too.  You think they should take his gold away bc he used to be a miner? They should pin the gold rush on him, and not human greed huh? 

I mean you're absolutely right people will look for someone or something to blame. Right now they are blaming ""they"". They could be hedge funds, Wall Street, shorters, whatever. But Keith gill didn't make himself the face of the ""movement"", wsb did that. He wasn't the only one showing off his gains either. I'm sure someone will try to sue but legally they probably wouldn't succeed."
03/15/2021,stocks,What are some good EU alternatives to VOO and QQQ? I've found that EQQQ and CSPX come up a lot.
03/15/2021,stocks,I was around 30 percent down a few week ago and have clawed my way up to 7 percent.  A couple expensive learning lessons. Can't wait to actually see it go green!
03/15/2021,stocks,"I'd disagree. Apple is growing with Apple Music, Apple TV, and soon their AR technology. They're going to more than likely introduce AR Glasses / Headsets. It's a huge play. The news alone would spike the stock. There's room to grow with Apple. They're investing a lot into R&D."
03/15/2021,stocks,"EQQQ is the best alternative to QQQ in EU. if you want the currency hedged version it is NQSE. VUSA and IUSA should be the alternative to VOO, that pay out dividend. SXR8 is the same as IUSA but automatically reinvest the dividends. As per SMH, which is one of my favourite, just recently was launched the EU alternative which is VVSM. These are the ones I know and use at least."
03/15/2021,stocks,What exactly do you disagree on?
03/15/2021,stocks,"Thanks a lot for the explanation!

Are there any other differences between CSPX and VUSA? I read that the former is an accumulating fond, whereas the latter is distributing. Is there anything else that I should keep in mind when comparing similar trackers like these?"
03/15/2021,stocks,"The main difference is like you say one is distributing and one is accumulating. Otherwise they are exactly the same ETF but from 2 different companies, you'll be fine either way!"
03/15/2021,stocks,Yeah bought pits on them last week retail keeps buying them up. I think the cruise industry is done for and they are at pre COVID valuations already. Market is out to lunch right now. Prob go up tomorrow. My play for the year is short cruises stocks.
03/15/2021,stocks,Only book value of cruise ships are worth something lol. They aren’t.
03/15/2021,stocks,They lose 1 billion a quarter. It’s insane. They have to dilute more maybe enough idiots with stimulus checks are buying. What’s worse cruises or Macy’s lol
03/15/2021,stocks,Until one of these companies goes under this market won’t get reasonable. Every company has two years of cash to burn though.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Bruh its not like the guy was presenting his opinion as inarguable fact.

This is a stock DISCUSSION forum, people are going to discuss and bounce opinions. Idk why you had to respond with passive aggressive bullshit instead of just saying u disagree"
03/15/2021,stocks,The ceo knows what is up. This was the shit he was wiling to say on record. Can you imagine how bad it really is?
03/15/2021,stocks,Lol we are in the bigggest bubble of our times when u guys are arguing against the ceo of a company. Sure cruises may come back. They will lose 6 billion dollars waiting. They don’t have that money how do they get it? Fucking use ur brains for half a second.

I’m a hands on learner. I can’t just read the books or watch a video. Believe me, I’ve spent countless hours doing so. I learn better by doing it myself and seeing the outcome. It’s hard to be “hands on” with the stock market, so it maybe something I’m never going to be able to fully understand."

03/15/2021,stocks,Read the story.
03/15/2021,stocks,The story implies that it was her buying the shares that moved the price.
03/15/2021,stocks,"Yes. Didn't even take 100 shares each day. 1 would do.

 The seller's order in the book sets the price that share sells at, and changes at the whim of the seller. The  lady is looking at the Last price and buying at-market. Her buy is filled at the Ask price, which can be as high as the seller wants. In this case he sets it a dime higher than the Last price. Each day she buys at the Ask, which becomes the new Last. Each day the seller moves the Ask up.

On the day she wants to sell, there are still Ask offers but no Bid offers on the book. Hence, ""but to whom?""

*That* is how the market works.

Throw away all your observations and assumptions and whatever you think is your sense of its behavior. Start over knowing the mechanism and rebuild all of that. The book does not have any concern for tradition or probability or human nature. It all changes with every order entered, and can be in any state at all."

03/15/2021,stocks,"That means they spent $16,805 in 1988 for those 6,722 shares, which adjusted for inflation is equivalent to $37,362.22 today. 

OP's 6,722 shares are really 26,888 shares going off of the two aforementioned 2-1 stock splits since 1988, and google tells me the current stock price of MDP is $36.96 per share. 26,888 times $36.96 = $993,780.48.

So using modern-day values a $37k investment by OP's grandfather resulted in OP having $993,780.48, i.e. a total profit of $956,418.26. OP's grandad's diamond hands truly paid off for his grandchildren.

OP will definitely need to consult a lawyer and find out his Grandfather's will to see who exactly was entitled to those shares."

Like all the secret societies get such a bad reputation from the crazy conspiracy theorists saying they are pedophiles and sacrifice children and shit like that. In reality, secret societies are just cool people who help and support each other and try to get ahead in the world through networking with each other and building each other up.

If they are NOT qualified dividends, they are taxed as income. 

Unfortunately for you, you live in California, which doesn't care if you have qualified dividends or not. You will be taxed at 13.3% for any dividend amount. Combined with federal taxes, California is the most expensive state in the nation for capital gains."

It would be even harder for GameStop to get good deals initially because they don’t deal in general electronics besides consoles. Why don’t you ask yourself why any other business does not offer this service, and the answer is that it is not viable in the current market. Even if it became viable places like Best Buy would destroy GameStop. Furthermore, GameStop does not sell PC games so they would be selling products to customers who would never need to come back."

03/15/2021,stocks,"Hi Rainforest,
I do like look at the financial myself and I go after specific types of stocks.  The gut feel that I referred to is when there are conflicting call on the same stock from different analyst - IE, one may say buy and another hold - that sort of thing.  I look at a lot dividend stocks - timing of buying can be influence by the ex-dividend date and quarterly results. I buy the stocks directly for the dividends.  For more speculative stocks, I do a lot more of my own DD, IE, calling company, talking to who I can, etc.  For example, I started buying this little speculative gold exploration years.  I talked to CEO well over 100 times.  Frankly, the stock has been bad - I am down 50%, but I don't give up easily.  I have been helping the company planning and preparing for fund raising, etc.  I am cover by an NDA so I can't give any details.  But, I would strongly recommend you have at look it - GWA on ventures exchange.  I expect that it will do very well in the next couple years. I have a very large position in the company and I anticipate it will be taken over next year once its mine is in full commercial production."
03/15/2021,stocks,"Hi Cynic4200, thank you so much! I'm especially interested in gold mining stocks at the moment because I believe that logic will prevail sooner or later about gold prices (I think it's very undervalued right now if one takes everything into consideration). Gold miners' margin prices should profit from that, and they are also inherently better than GLD because they actually create value instead of simply storing it. But there are so many smaller companies that I would have no chance to find out which one has better potential, not with the resources that I have at least (limited to Internet research). Being ready to lose in the beginning, and having patience, is the key to success, I'm with you on that. Really thank you for sharing your opinion!"

03/15/2021,stocks,"Rate can always change. People keep thinking the interest rates will keep going down, but that's just wishful thinking. It may go up, and it may come back down too, but does that mean people should stop buying homes? Refinancing will go down, but people buy new homes every now and then after several years, so it doesn't mean anything to the business in the long run.

Even it it goes up now, the rate is still lower than 10years ago. If those who assume it is high now and not refinance, it may even go up later and they might eventually refinance at higher. It's hard to time these things and wise one shoildnt let a mere small increase stop them. If it goes down later, refinance, no big deal..if it goes up, you are in a good spot. Win win"

i know the 7-9% figure for simply holding shares, but don't typically see numbers for ""if you sell covered calls or sell puts, you can get an extra x% per year"".

just because 2020 (and 2021 so far) has been such a statistical anomaly, i'm assuming that i shouldn't be taking what i've seen in the last year (10-20%) as representative of normal returns. right now i just track weekly totals of what i collected in premiums, and then look at 2 averages (average per week from when i started doing options last year, and average per week only looking at 2021). it's kind of a small sample size during one of the most bizarre stretches in history, which makes it hard to project how this stacks up against normal returns over say a decade.

03/15/2021,stocks,"I have been an investor in Taseko, TGB, for several painful years.  While there are indeed dozens of junior minors, the reasons I originally got into Taseko are still valid today:

\-Producing mine(s), not just paper development rights.  Mines take years to develop, the path is frouhgt with red tape and NIMBY's at every angle.  

\-Taseko has been producing and in business for 20 years +, so they have proven they can make it through the eventual hard times that inevitabily hit the commodity markets

\-Mines and or rights are located in Canada and the U.S.  No foreign, corrupt dictatiorship regimes to deal with and no risk of sudden phony fines or confiscation of assets. 

&#x200B;

That said, the stock has been a Dog for years, I mean a real no dividend paying bitch.  It did manage to reamin cash flow positive and demonstrated they could cut costs to survive when copper plunged in 2008 and again last year, so I consider then well managed for a capital allocation standpoint. 

Their main mine, Gibralter in canada produces circa 125mln pounds of copper a year at acost of circa $ 2.00  Based on a copper price assumtion of 4$, they should show positive cash flow this year of circa 250mln, or nearly ,90 cents per share.   This does not include capital investments of circa 50mln, but they will be very cash flow positive.  This is based on current metrics.  I think copper is going to take out it's all time high this year and head towards 5$ and above. 

\-Copper Story:  Every car has circa 30-40lbs of copper in it. EV cars have circa 120lbs.  IN addtion, copper goes into every building, house and many industrial and infrastructure uses.  So, we are probably on the verge of a copper super-cycle.  while Copper is easier to mine than gold-once the mine is open-going from land rights to operating mine takes years.  This means we are probably headed for a major squeeze in Copper supply-demand, probably the biggest post war we have seen. 

So, the set up is:  

Copper is Going Higher, Mines take years to project and get running

Every increase in copper prices above break even flows to the bottom line of miners, so the earnings grow exponentially as the price of copper increases.

TGB has a large producing copper assets. 

Now, based on this alone, I am looking for eps of ,30-35c per share this year from Taseko, conservatevly based on 4$ copper.  that could double if we go to 5$ copper.  I believe this stock could receive a valuation of 8-10x earnings this year, or $2.40-3.00 minimum.  If copper goes to 5$, that could be doubled.  

They have received final approval from local authorites to begin work on a mine in Arizona, (This process has been years in the making, so the mine is almost shovel ready). 

Final federal approval should come in the 2nd half of 2021 and plans are immedialty to begin construction.  Total construciton cost is estimated to be about 230mln.  At present Taseko has about 200mln in the bank and, by the time we get to the end of the year, they cold fiinance the mine themselves or bring in a partner at attractive conditions.  This mine is projected to produce about another 100mln lbs of copper at a cost below $2$.  

So, plans are by year end 2022 to be producing over 200mln pounds of copper.  With copper at 4$, I am looking for it to hig $4.80-7$ when that happens and $10-15-00 is a possibile valuationi if copper goes and stays substantially above $4.00

&#x200B;

The stock has been a dog, but it is well managed, has real mines and real developments in the pipeline and it is in the sweet spot to take advantage of the comming copper squeeze. 

My caviot would be, don't expect it to move 100% in a month. It may, it may not.  I am convinced of the potential over 12-18 months to get to the above pricing and there may even be someone interested in taking it private before the second mine comes on line and jacks up the price-hoping that does not happen.  being a small cap, under the radar stock, it has to prove itself but, with all the ducks in line, it looks set to do that.  At present, very few analyists cover it and I suspect that will change as investment interest builds. 

&#x200B;

If you have a time horizon to at least the end of this year, worth condieration here, but don't expect it to go to 2.50 by next week.  It may get near there following 1st quarter earning results in may.

These stocks give you a great foundation to start with either way, I would slowly begin adding your own money to trade with.
