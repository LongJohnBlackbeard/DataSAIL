2021-04-27 19:53:21,wallstreetbets,Good bot
2021-04-27 18:23:58,wallstreetbets,"That's never happened to me with Fidelity or Ameritrade. Might want to use a professional brokerage. Yeah, I pay fees, but my trades execute."
2021-04-27 18:34:01,wallstreetbets,"FYI, the real value of an option is the bid. The difference between bid and ask is the cost it takes to be considered a retard. Now have you found weaponized autism and if not, was your battery low?"
2021-04-27 18:39:18,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes in sell offs you need to cross the bid to sell, just like sometimes in popular stocks the ask gets crossed.

If we ever get 10-20% spx correction people are going get wrecked if they think stop losses going save them when there is no buyers."
2021-04-27 18:20:53,wallstreetbets,Robin the hood strikes again !
2021-04-27 18:36:01,wallstreetbets,Lmao this is what free trading gets you. Congratulations! Or you could’ve spent .65 per contract at a real broker and saved yourself from heavier loses
2021-04-27 18:23:00,wallstreetbets,That's what you get for using a dogshit broker like Robinhood
2021-04-27 18:39:21,wallstreetbets,"Im confused.  They look filled in the screenshot.  Anyway options are always hard to get a good fill.  Most  likely you will  be trading with a dealer of some kind and not a natural buyer/seller.  The fill you see may be a sell at bid and a buy at ask with the dealer, leaving you out of the entire trade flow.  And generally the spreads are quite high. Even more so with high-vol stocks. I tell people if you want to test a strategy/paper trade, you need to sell at the bid and buy at the ask.  https://www.optionstrading.org/basics/trader-types/market-makers/"
2021-04-27 18:21:25,wallstreetbets,That sounds like Robinhood shenanigans
2021-04-27 19:08:30,wallstreetbets,"Do you understand volatility? Check there first, bud."
2021-04-27 18:41:50,wallstreetbets,"Ow. Thank you good person. Don’t understand. 

Q: If they can be filled.. how would you know or can you know?. Also, am sorry pretty ignorant, so no idea, 

but is idea to do this when likely to be already trending down in order to stop going even further, 

but then it does not do so, or does not help? Is that normal?

Go well for the future."
2021-04-27 18:29:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah losing $4k ($6.5k if you include missed profits) makes a pretty hard argument to want to stay with Robinhood.
2021-04-27 18:40:48,wallstreetbets,"My limit sell was $3.8 and my stop loss was $3.0. Within 2 hours of placing my order the bid-ask was between $4.05-$4.25. Sadly I walked away from my PC *assuming* Robinhood would fill one of the two sell limits, not neither. There was plenty of room for the take profit to fill. On the other hand, there was still plenty of room for the stop loss to fill on the way down before I went negative, yet here we are"
2021-04-27 19:18:57,wallstreetbets,You can’t sell something if no one wants to buy it.
2021-04-27 18:25:04,wallstreetbets,What brokerage would you recommend?
2021-04-27 18:55:14,wallstreetbets,"Sorry for the confusion, I wasn't able to screenshot my position live so I only have the before and after. The ""during"" is when my stop loss and take profit didn't fill, despite the bid-ask being \~$0.20-0.45 over what my take profit was set for. I walked away and came back to see neither of the limits I set were filled and had to sell at a pretty hard loss."
2021-04-27 19:19:45,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the prices were jumping around quite a bit, being the day of expiration and all. But unfortunately despite the range of the bid-ask exceeding my take profit (and not for a short 2 second blip, but for a solid hour or two), nothing filled when it should/could have. 

^(Or maybe I'm just a Grade A retard)"
2021-04-27 19:05:52,wallstreetbets,"Under normal circumstances your positions should fill if the price you set them to sell at is reached. This may not happen if the price you set is only reached for a short time, then goes back down before your position got it's chance to sell. Imagine it like your position is waiting in line to sell. Orders queued before yours may sell but if there is a low volume of sales, you may not get your position sold at the price you want before the market goes below your chosen sell price.

&#x200B;

In my situation, the price I wanted to sell my positions at was reached and exceeded by a pretty good amount, but never filled. On the other hand I had a stop loss set to sell at a price that still made me money, even if the prices went down. That did not fill either. The reason why it did not fill could be:

1. The price of my options were changing way too quickly to fill
2. Too low of trade volume to fill
3. Too low of trade volume at the prices I specified to fill
4. I did something wrong and I'm just stupid
5. Robinhood just decided to be mean to me >:("
2021-04-27 19:31:27,wallstreetbets,I believe He set limit orders and they didn’t sell when it hit his target price. Robinhood glitching smh

2021-04-27 19:05:11,wallstreetbets,I have 1700 shares! Locked and loaded ready to mmmmoooooon.
2021-04-27 18:28:42,wallstreetbets,"Note. I say Thursday because of the news cycle.

 They say no. The merger may not happen. They know we're watching. 

But if you look at the charts [here](https://ibb.co/sK44Pp1) they're damn near identical.

They're already being treated like one company.

And again, both are larger cannabis stocks with new products and good profits.

If you buy like me, and just break even, this is a long term stock."
2021-04-27 19:55:04,wallstreetbets,"I’m new to the market, but i’m holding APHA. Once it merges will I lose my share of APHA and gain TLRY?? Or will I get separate shares of each?"

2021-04-27 19:42:51,wallstreetbets,Not again
2021-04-27 18:24:36,wallstreetbets,They will. A majority of the population supports it. The government can make gains from it. The pressure is on.
2021-04-27 18:41:45,wallstreetbets,"I don't trust any news cycle when it comes to stonks. Do your own research, analysts are there to benefit hedge funds.

WSB is in the news multiple times a day now. They don't want apes to win. Misinformation abound."
2021-04-27 19:59:31,wallstreetbets,"You'll see gains, as long as TLRY stays a reasonable amount above apha."

2021-04-27 19:15:33,wallstreetbets,"You'll break even, assuming they don't rise.

They likely will once the vote happens.

2021-04-27 18:21:09,wallstreetbets,"When you're moving in dollars and cents.... a company could be selling sriracha butt plugs and I'll invest if I see a profit.

The news says no, like every other stock that's given me a bump. 

The merger isn't certain, but seems likely.

Math seems about right.

Time to buy."

Tobacco and alcohol companies are able to pass the taxes down to the consumer, weed companies aren’t able to do that also with the black market available they can’t really raise prices. But you do you. Hope you make some cash"
2021-04-27 19:38:53,wallstreetbets,No brainer and politics don't mix.  Kwow bringing in a fuck ton of tax revenue does.
2021-04-27 18:31:41,wallstreetbets,Let the market crash. And buy moar. They'll be there afterward.

2021-04-27 18:34:43,wallstreetbets,"A lot of consumers are finding out that Cannabis is more potent and better overall when regulated. I live in Michigan, we've been legal for a minute. Once full legalization or federal regulation takes hold, it will strangle a majority of the black market. It's already happening here."
2021-04-27 19:09:12,wallstreetbets,Tell that to all the dispensaries in Cali passing the 15% excise tax AND 8% sales tax AND 10% cannabis business tax down to their customers. Not to mention prices being higher in general because of cultivation tax.
2021-04-27 19:16:02,wallstreetbets,What do you mean “pass the tax down”?
2021-04-27 19:35:24,wallstreetbets,I am very happy with 5 each they are my little babies
2021-04-27 19:09:54,wallstreetbets,How much for a zip
2021-04-27 19:20:41,wallstreetbets,I’m retarded but don’t tobacco and alcohol companies pass the taxes they have to pay to the consumer? Ie they charge more for product because they have higher taxes
2021-04-27 19:56:22,wallstreetbets,Add 3 zeros to the end of that 5 and you should be good. This is the way. 🚀 💎 🤲
2021-04-27 19:31:58,wallstreetbets,"The dispensary I occasionally go to is showing \~$180 for recreational, \~$120 for medical for a zip. But there's only 2-6 options and you gotta buy those in 2 1/2 bags.

8ths start at $30 for recreational, $20 medical. Peak at $70 an 8th. But much better selection of brands and strains."

2021-04-27 19:25:29,wallstreetbets,"You were right though. The only reason they took this off the table was because people overwhelmingly voted no. 

So they took it out and may repropose later. And they already said in their 8k they are issuing 43m shares like this week. 

But, obviously I’m happy to hear 500m won’t be issued. I think even with further dilution we will see a bump."

2021-04-27 19:37:25,wallstreetbets,No way.  They got their asses handed to them behind closed doors.  They don't give a shit about retail.
2021-04-27 19:49:44,wallstreetbets,"Because they’ve had those shares forever. The CEO is doing all he can to say, “We’re for the squeeze and we don’t want to fuck it up” without actually saying it. He’s all for it because it’s in the best interest of the company. Smoke a crayon and chill out."
2021-04-27 18:21:22,wallstreetbets,Even though its a fair amount I think people were just way more worried about the 500 mil.
2021-04-27 18:24:19,wallstreetbets,Can you explain this please?
2021-04-27 18:36:38,wallstreetbets,From my understanding the 43 million shares are for compensation packages to employees.
2021-04-27 19:56:19,wallstreetbets,"Good. A lot of people were concerned about AMC diluting the market with 500m shares which would give the shorts/HF a chance to cover by buying up the diluted shares, ruining the short squeeze. The CEO participated in an interview and promised they will not use any of the 500m shares they're asking for during 2021. However, people were still skeptical because he was still pushing for the vote to have 500m dilution shares at AMC's disposal if they ever needed it after 2021 ends. Now they're straight up saying they're not even going to bother vote/discuss for the 500m dilution shares for a long time, hinting as to when the squeeze is done, because the shareholders(us) don't want it. Retail investors own about 90% of the float as of currently to give you a good idea of how scary it is for the shorts.

EDIT: Added last 3 sentences which is a key detail"
2021-04-27 19:18:30,wallstreetbets,This was just reported. AMC 🚀🚀🚀 tomorrow morning
2021-04-27 18:14:58,wallstreetbets,Don’t take it personal my ape. Maybe they want to see where this goes. Well done to them for helping the squeeze. I’d want to fuck the fuckers who shorted the fuck out of my company too. Perhaps this will be hilarious and profitable
2021-04-27 19:18:38,wallstreetbets,"thank god there’s someone with a brain following this ticker. 

guess i just have to look for the downvoted comments to find some common sense"
2021-04-27 19:29:25,wallstreetbets,I think he said off the table.
2021-04-27 19:30:27,wallstreetbets,"Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words.

2021-04-27 19:30:23,wallstreetbets,I don’t think they are going to use all 43 million at once. In the sec filing it also states they have the right to use “from time to time”.
2021-04-27 19:24:05,wallstreetbets,"I don't believe you watched the whole video. A bit too much use of the term ""natural long term growth"", but he also can't just come out and say ""we going to the moon apes, squeeze incoming.""

2021-04-27 19:46:22,wallstreetbets,"Retail is going to play the largest role in increasing their share value, they definitely care a little bit. Look at how long GME has maintained their massive increase even after the (edit: first) squeeze, despite most of its future being purely speculative. 

We will give this man his 450m shares after the squeeze is done, and AMC will be around for a long time to come."
2021-04-27 18:36:17,wallstreetbets,They already had 43 million shares available. They made a deal with three companies to distribute them as an at the market offering.
2021-04-27 18:47:04,wallstreetbets,No they are no giving them to employees...golman Sachs is evolved somehow but that's good cause they are a HF that's long on AMC

2021-04-27 19:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Guess you’re right it’s an at the market offering, but I thought there was just a shareholder vote to introduce a similar share amount for compensation packages as well. https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Entertainment-Announces-At-The-Market-Offering-Program-and-Withdraws-Proposal-to-Increase-Authorized-Shares/default.aspx

2021-04-27 18:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Apparently most of the shortage is not due to chips ect. It's due to the fact that they just can't keep them in stock because people are buying them all.

2021-04-27 19:17:16,wallstreetbets,"Great DD! One of the companies they will be competing soon with is Atai Life Sciences, backed by Peter Thiel. It's an umbrella company that has a similar pipeline! Not sure when Atai will IPO, but should be in the next few weeks. I'm planning on starting a position there too. It'll be a wild ride and Atai's IPO will definitely be a catalyst for MindMed as well."
2021-04-27 19:34:36,wallstreetbets,"Jesus good DD man.  Too bad im not up north I got years of experience under my belt.  I wanted to do this shit 15 years ago and got laughed at.  I think MAPS was the only group i knew of that was willing to make an attempt and had so much federal red tape it was insane.  The iso ketamine thing has gained traction w them opening the clinics around the states, and wasnt it john hopkins that did the end of life study w mushrooms and it improved the quality of life for participants."

2021-04-27 18:25:29,wallstreetbets,"Great DD, thanks for sharing! My question is, how will effective mental health treatments, the need for which, one assumes, decreases with number of applications and improvements in process/technology, be a viable stock long term? I'm all about this mental health revolution in theory but the intent/compelling science runs counter to everything I know about capitalism."
2021-04-27 18:29:05,wallstreetbets,How many shares has the company issued?
2021-04-27 18:33:55,wallstreetbets,This is what we need

2021-04-27 19:51:09,wallstreetbets,"They'll have no revenue for at least another 5 years. Their entire business model relies on the US government legalising numerous schedule one narcotics. They have tremendous operating expenses meaning they'll have to survive via offerings until they're eventually cash flow positive.

Anyone buying in now when their market cap is close to $2 billion is quite frankly insane."
2021-04-27 19:11:02,wallstreetbets,I didn’t see you mention their net loss of $35 million last year. Or out of nowhere CNN for the first time ever has an unknown company’s CEO on live because they got listed on the Nasdaq at less then $4. Nothing suspect about any of this at all. Not to mention this is extremely well written for a guy who pretty much hasn’t posted anything. Almost as if it was written for you.
2021-04-27 18:59:38,wallstreetbets,Love the stock!
2021-04-27 19:12:46,wallstreetbets,that's a lot of words

2021-04-27 18:40:54,wallstreetbets,"Your worries about LSD bad trips or lasting forever is not that concerning. The doses are far less than the threshold of concern.

IMO the main risk would be big pharma. Big pharma will get big fukt with their fucked up ""anti"" depressants, which come with low efficacy yet side effects of build up and addiction. They are also over priced. I'd be surprised if big pharma does nothing to fight psychedelics, including their stock prices.

Another important point is that, you do not keep using psychedelics like you do with anti depressants. The studies introduce it as a one off session that can last months or years."
2021-04-27 19:25:44,wallstreetbets,"Any of you retards that think something like this is going to be as big as the largest weed stock need to rethink your investment thesis...

OP did mention it, and it appears OP is super into this company and psychedelics in general so this post may not be as suspect.  That said, I'm always skeptical when a company starts popping up everywhere with extreme upside potential. Worth researching yourself if it sounds good"

2021-04-27 19:25:46,wallstreetbets,Correct. That's what a pharmaceutical research and development company does. Just like a mining exploration company - they don't make money until they find gold. MNMD has the gold they just need the FDA to approve it and the trial results to be positive.
2021-04-27 19:52:09,wallstreetbets,"Still the biggest in the game by an order of magnitude. Almost all the competition I could find would be ruined by sunk rnd costs like that.

Still a very new industry through who knows what happens over the next few years. I just know my therapist is trying to get clinical trials started for several classic psychoactives and the push is on to make clinical access and use of psychadelics a reality in conservative western countries.

The supply side just has to be ready to pounce."

More often then not theres many discounted buying opportunities and down the line there may be windows with less risk. Share prices in the sector usually almost never goes straight up, people should be understanding of many different factors before they chase price action."

2021-04-27 18:12:40,wallstreetbets,VIAC is slowly inching back to 50 which IMO is its fair value with 15 PE ratio (that said if you value it like any other media company it could go much higher).
2021-04-27 19:11:57,wallstreetbets,Anyone have any of those 🍄? I’m sad

2021-04-27 19:25:17,wallstreetbets,"My first big options win happened in 2018. 

I purchased a way out of the money Facebook put for  earnings around $250. Which under normal circumstances was a terrible play and a waste of money. 

>>The social-media behemoth’s stock lost roughly one-fifth of its value in the extended session Wednesday. The stock dropped about 7% immediately after the earnings report was released, then plummeted to a loss of more than 20% as a conference call with analysts progressed.  

Facebook infamously tanked over 20% which made that option worth around $4,000 at open. I was instantly hooked on options.

Lost all those gains gambling on $TSLA.

TL;DR: Buy Facebook puts for earnings."

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** strike leap calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **98.50** which gives us a total value of:

#$985,000

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

You think [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) treasures her like I do? We already know that. Lisa is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Her very existence was established decades ago when the market was valuing Micron’s expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of is evidence that Lisa is the hottest babe on the planet, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent Micron. Lisa deniers are a myth. Lisa sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (Lisa will be the heat death of the universe because she’s so hot). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether Lisa Su is smoking hot, know that it has already been proven and don't dare suggest she isn’t otherwise."

Plus Elon is going on SNL and the stock will get a bump from a sketch where he comes out on stage with diamond-crusted hands and screams “STONKS” at the top of his lungs.

VXRT has been mostly trading sideways with clear lower resistance around $5 and had a modest break up today. If its oral vaccine works, this is a rocket about to take off. I bet it will. This company got its growing pains out of the way.

SNAP is iffy for me, but I see a sideways trend pausing before continuing up. First quarter surprise is a good thing and will drive it up."

2021-04-27 19:27:24,wallstreetbets,"I belong here, a short story:  
Yesterday, in the ecstasy that was MVIS & GME making my portfolio come ever so close to a net 0% position (been down like 20 - 30% for a lil bit), I decided to do some YOLOing on the SPY weeklies since it's a popular ape thing to do and I was vibing.  I saw some $418s going on sale for $0.35 (early Monday morning, SPY was around $417) and I'm thinkin hell yeah, I can totes see this going easily over the $418.35 it would take for that to profit by Friday.  Hell yeah, I'm smart as hell and I buy 10 of those suckers.  Throughout the day, I watched some sporadic action going on, but luckily in the early afternoon it starts rising!  At one point, I was up a cool 20% and I'm thinking ""shit yeah, let's call it a wrap for today, tomorrow we may see if it rises and I can just sell these suckers off for maybe a quick 2 day 100% gain!"".  Well out of nowhere, the value drops to $.07 and I'm just kind of confused but whatever, the market always acts weird.  Log on this morning and they're just gone? I go to check my transaction history, because I put a sell order out, so they should at least be chilling waiting to get sold right? No, these bitches expired.

What actually occurred: My dumb ass didn't read the expiry date correctly.  Clearly I bought the 4/26 SPY thinking it was a weekly.  In my haze, I then realize that not only did I not read the expiry date incorrectly the first time, what I likely did was incorrectly read it as 4/28 for the expiry date which I at the time was thinking Friday.  That $350 never stood a chance in my wallet."

Yes semiconductor shortages are a thing, but everyone is affected by that, and the market doesn't seem to care for any other company. Actually, the only company not effected by semiconductor shortages is Intel, and seeing how they are selling far less than the rest of the market, that market share had to be going somewhere.

This is the perfect combo for another AMD to pop off. Can't wait for tomorow!"

2021-04-27 17:06:49,wallstreetbets,We’ll see if there is gain porn if u had calls from last weeks dip at 79 then it should be good. A lot of people did buy into AMD I made a few hundred buying Thursday’s dip and selling Friday and it only went to 83
2021-04-27 17:33:05,wallstreetbets,probably theta as well considering u probably bought it a few days out at a ridiculous strike price like 400
2021-04-27 17:29:33,wallstreetbets,greeks are fun
2021-04-27 17:36:47,wallstreetbets,"Don't make it too complicated. Just add the value of the contract with the stock price and go from there. If you bought a call for $20.00 per contract and GME is at $150.00, then 150+20 = $170 <- this is what GME needs to be at before your call expires to breakeven. Now of course you can still earn gains before this but it will depend on theta, gamma, and other greek yogurts but better to just find the breakeven and how likely it is to hit it."
2021-04-27 17:30:56,wallstreetbets,What's the expiration date and what's the strike? More than likely you just got IV fucked

Let's say you lay 1500/mo in mortgage and the best you can do is rent for 1000. But you can make 500 more a month net in city with a real economy.

Move, rent, pay the difference. Move to a real city, rent the house for 1000, make an extra 500/mo with your new job in the big city, and pay the mortgage off your rental income and job income.

Do this for as long as you can until the housing market improves where you were, or you get sick of it and sell and cut your losses and move on with your life."

2021-04-27 17:45:21,wallstreetbets,"Windows absolutely. It's more convenient and feature rich. I used a Mac I was assigned in a college filmmaking course, and the layout functioned well as a workstation, but Mac OS is butt ugly and I hate apple's business practices, higher prices for outdated tech, and anti third party repair shit they purposefully engineer for their products. Also, if you're somebody who likes to upgrade your PC yourself, you're usually shit out of luck with a Mac. They sell a laptop with 8gb of ram, 256 gb ssd and no dedicated gpu for 999 dollars lmfao. 

Their included mice and keyboards are also dogshit when compared to Lenovo."

Once it broke that resistance, it flew like 20+% within a few weeks which doesn't seem like a lot but if you bought options that's more than a 500% gain. I don't remember the numbers but shit, if I had 100K to throw my portfolio into, it would certainly be AMD."

2021-04-27 17:52:12,wallstreetbets,Sunrun closed at a high of $96.50 on January 8th - there's lots of upside. They carry a lot of debt but if that infrastructure bill passes you might see them making a LOT of money...

2021-04-27 15:57:23,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the comment, you may be right regarding Xpeng. For me, the sharp jump in FB for RUN looks a little suspicious, and I didn’t find any news that would explain this objectively"

2021-04-27 18:26:49,wallstreetbets,Shanghai auto show and their new P5 might play a part. But its more convenient to be ignorant and go the China FUD route for you it seems.
2021-04-27 19:35:43,wallstreetbets,Well it could possibly mean it’s overvalued. Not always but possibly

Its a great business model man. 50 is not the short term ceiling imo."
2021-04-27 17:06:49,wallstreetbets,Erm maybe the fact China is pushing to have home grown EV companies and that market is going to explode in the next 5-10 years?

2021-04-27 19:17:27,wallstreetbets,I'm knew to this stock so can someone kindly walk me through the catalysts? Or is it a short squeeze mainly?
2021-04-27 19:50:20,wallstreetbets,This reminds me of overhyped weed stocks.
2021-04-27 15:20:14,wallstreetbets,Chsee

2021-04-27 16:12:20,wallstreetbets,I’m going to add my $150 if Wealthsimple will deposit my money soon. It says it’s there but not there ?
2021-04-27 15:19:23,wallstreetbets,It was just listed today so there might be a delay but MNMD is the right ticker
2021-04-27 15:32:10,wallstreetbets,"The one on Wealthsimple is the same, just on a Canadian exchange. Buy that one, it mimics MNMD and you won’t get charged exchange fees."
2021-04-27 15:32:53,wallstreetbets,Mmed is the Canadian I believe.
2021-04-27 16:12:31,wallstreetbets,You can also buy MMED.TO if you want to buy in canadian dollars. Id recommend this one. Wasn’t hit as hard today.
2021-04-27 15:46:46,wallstreetbets,Going to take a week or two for this stock to become steady. I'm in for the long haul with this one. There is a bunch of drug trials on the horizon and I don't see much movement until that happens.
2021-04-27 15:36:44,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it’s the first company in the psychedelics sector to really start pushing. Uplifted to the nasdaq, had a spot on CNN etc etc. It’s going to move up in down with volatility, particularly as it’s picking up steam again on social media with the uplist. Could be swing-traded or held for some first-mover action in a pretty new sector."
2021-04-27 15:26:39,wallstreetbets,"Down, certainly."
2021-04-27 17:17:42,wallstreetbets,"Similar boat, but in it for the long haul."
2021-04-27 15:46:50,wallstreetbets,"Next week brother, next week."
2021-04-27 16:34:45,wallstreetbets,I see the price hitting at least $10 in the coming weeks.
2021-04-27 15:32:59,wallstreetbets,Yes it was uplisted to Nasdaq
2021-04-27 15:42:03,wallstreetbets,No it is not
2021-04-27 15:44:48,wallstreetbets,My broker shows $1.3B
2021-04-27 15:41:32,wallstreetbets,"This stock has been on most investors radar since last fall, mainstream crowd just catching on because of the uplist. This stock isn’t going anywhere - the company is for real and they’re pushing pretty hard to establish themselves as number one in the sector. If you believe psychedelics will not continue with the legality and in-roads they’re making in mental health that’s one thing, but as far as the sector goes Mindmed is the front runner right now."
2021-04-27 17:34:04,wallstreetbets,"It’s not there, MMED is there though"
2021-04-27 15:52:25,wallstreetbets,Thanks man!
2021-04-27 15:52:17,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-04-27 18:05:32,wallstreetbets,"This is an interesting area: the drug trials. For me though, I don't put as much emphasis on the trials and their outcomes. 

That is to say, I has some shares of invivo, which has some experimental implants to help with sinal injuries. The success of that company more or less hinges on the trials having good outcomes, as their technology is cutting edge and speculative. It could go to $0 

In this case, while there do exist real hurtles legally and medically, I feel as if the core evidence does exist in many forms, just not in trials. This is a situation where I feel more comfortable leaning on anecdotal reports, and from a first hand perspective, I can say for certain that even dabbling in psychedelics a small amount improved my outlook on life and my happiness. Not medical advice, but I guess my point being, literally all signs point to psychedelics playing a *significant* role in treating drug resistant depression and the like. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.

We have decades of use in non clinical trials that assure some degree of safety (no one is going to die in a clinical or something devastating) - and to my knowledge nearly every study done to date has shown these drugs to be like magic for treating depression. Momentum is overwhelming begind this, whereas some other pharma stocks hinge on something significantly more speculative."
2021-04-27 16:13:28,wallstreetbets,Do you have sources for news on this company? I'd like to keep my eyes on that stuff
2021-04-27 15:54:55,wallstreetbets,"Cmps is in the same boat with psychedelics, no?"

2021-04-27 16:45:28,wallstreetbets,Just Google and start looking around. It was talked about on cnn today. This is a get in early type of stock with a growing market and incredibly interesting trials with updates coming mid may. Seems like a good long play.
2021-04-27 16:02:34,wallstreetbets,"They are, clinical trials also, and they're priced at $39 and rising"
2021-04-27 18:54:18,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-27 15:46:50,wallstreetbets,"It's an inside joke wall street insiders use. When an outsider asks ""What's uplisting?"" they'll say, ""nothing much, and don't call me listing."

2021-04-27 18:54:34,wallstreetbets,"LOL I finally sold my 2421 BB shares today for a $147 dollar profit, then deleted the ticker from my trading platform. Fuck off BlackBerry, hope to never see you again, it's been a completely shit 3 months 🤡"

2021-04-27 19:17:45,wallstreetbets,Every warehouse and distribution center too. They are everywhere
2021-04-27 19:02:37,wallstreetbets,Yep.  It's gonna skyrocket downward lol.
2021-04-27 19:56:57,wallstreetbets,Another limit down tomorrow
2021-04-27 15:11:46,wallstreetbets,"Yup, story of my life with BB"
2021-04-27 15:38:01,wallstreetbets,"These printers aren’t even mainly used for paper receipts. I worked for a company that implemented these printers into autonomous labeling machines that were then sold to Walmart Amazon, etc to label their boxes."
2021-04-27 15:14:18,wallstreetbets,Blackberry doesn’t make phones. Morons like this is exactly the reason it’s so oversold and exactly the reason it will explode when people see QNX and IVY
2021-04-27 16:14:55,wallstreetbets,Yup. 95% of the courier parcels our business receives have a printed label on them. Couriers expect anyplace shipping more than a handful of parcels to have a printer and machine print the labels. Online growth = demand for zebras.
2021-04-27 14:43:03,wallstreetbets,At least you didn't buy at 28.
2021-04-27 14:43:08,wallstreetbets,"Great move, rest of this week is going to be spicy! A sample news baby!!!"

2021-04-27 14:54:34,wallstreetbets,Will there be another spike?
2021-04-27 14:54:17,wallstreetbets,"This is going to consolidate for a month then run again, Yours calls are gonna expire worthless"

2021-04-27 18:42:44,wallstreetbets,"Buying short calls before earnings that you plan to hold through earnings is lunacy. Just set your money on fire. IV crush will offset any good news. Buy leaps, or shares, or wait."
2021-04-27 14:43:05,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂😂 dumb 🤡
2021-04-27 15:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Retard here, what is this. Why is the current price $2.83"

2021-04-27 14:48:26,wallstreetbets,Nice. Good luck!! 🙏🏻
2021-04-27 15:03:10,wallstreetbets,"Dude 🤦🏻‍♂️ like you don’t know what you put your money into? 

We are waiting on Pr for an BEST IN CLASS A sample private demo that happened with tier 1 auto makers. We were told by the ceo it will all happen in the April time frame .... on Thursday they announced earnings call April 29th, from the expected usual date of may 9."
2021-04-27 18:14:47,wallstreetbets,So far they only announced their earnings call. I wish you the best of luck but proceed with caution.
2021-04-27 15:53:51,wallstreetbets,My 109 shares and I are ready lol
2021-04-27 15:33:45,wallstreetbets,Ah okay so he paid $4.12 x 47 ? And if he were to sell right now he would only make $2.83 x 47? Like these are American calls not European right ?
2021-04-27 15:04:04,wallstreetbets,Oh okay. So I’m gonna buy more. Like really YOLO
2021-04-27 15:05:51,wallstreetbets,I can’t decide to buy more calls tonight before close or waiting until open tomorrow to buy deeper in the dip?
2021-04-27 19:23:05,wallstreetbets,If you think that’s all that’s expected (you ignored they moved their call up by a week which is bullish) you haven’t done your DD on MVIS
2021-04-27 15:07:03,wallstreetbets,There is a chance we get a pr today after hours ... about the Lidar
2021-04-27 15:07:19,wallstreetbets,"I bought 350 calls already, I hope that helps answer any questions"
2021-04-27 15:08:12,wallstreetbets,Okay. That would be great. My avg was at 21 so I want it to go up. I’m gonna call 35
2021-04-27 15:12:26,wallstreetbets,But why? Why wouldn’t it just be at earnings?
2021-04-27 15:10:38,wallstreetbets,Already today or when it was at 12$? Damnit man I need answers!
2021-04-27 15:08:45,wallstreetbets,I have 300 and about to buy another 50 40c
2021-04-27 15:08:55,wallstreetbets,I recycled 655 35c yesterday

2021-04-27 15:29:33,wallstreetbets,Anything can happen from today to Thursday
2021-04-27 15:30:31,wallstreetbets,"I bought 50 at open for a very high price just incase it spiked, but I used 300 to average realllllly down at this current price"
2021-04-27 15:32:18,wallstreetbets,Okay. Do you think I should wait till the closing time?
2021-04-27 15:37:17,wallstreetbets,So just like me!
2021-04-27 15:38:30,wallstreetbets,Man it’s up to you I can’t really advise you to make a move
2021-04-27 15:39:10,wallstreetbets,But I think you should load up on shares this week if you don’t want to miss the next spike
2021-04-27 15:40:31,wallstreetbets,"Haha yeppppp But I got it way down I’m happy, I was going to buy 300 originally at the start, very glad I didntn"
2021-04-27 15:40:00,wallstreetbets,Alright man thanks I’ll see what I can do.
2021-04-27 15:54:13,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m hoping I can get in at a good price tomorrow but I’m debating hedging with puts
2021-04-27 14:10:58,wallstreetbets,If you deposit $9k it’ll be green again
2021-04-27 14:07:56,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service.

THIS moment right now was the catalyst for a while. So basically investing after the catalyst hit, people are waiting for some unknown thing to happen.

The stock landed on the moon already...instead of trying to figure out how to get to where it already is, it is actually time to depart and snort some moondust."

If we combine forces to fight pharmaceutical companies the same way we did with short sellers on GME, we can actually help people. 

I'm sure everyone here knows someone that is suffering and that is why I am voting with my dollar, so everyone here may be able to have those people with them in Croatia."
2021-04-27 14:24:32,wallstreetbets,"As opposed to yoloing on a video game company, real estate company, phone maker ? Because this company has potential to truly help society rather than sell shit people don't truly need and I'd much rather get in early."

2021-04-27 14:35:56,wallstreetbets,I like your vibes. I think if we have more mental health related issues from this pandemic then that will also increase the conversation of alternative medications.

2021-04-27 19:40:24,wallstreetbets,"No worries, 1000 shares at 5.69; right with you!"
2021-04-27 18:20:05,wallstreetbets,"Ha! you say that, but I did."
2021-04-27 19:22:14,wallstreetbets,You most certainly can.
2021-04-27 18:51:43,wallstreetbets,You must be new.
2021-04-27 16:40:53,wallstreetbets,"I’ve done shrooms at a party, it’s not that bad at all"
2021-04-27 19:19:25,wallstreetbets,"You buy a stock when it’s on a smaller exchange, and wait for it to be uplisted. For example, no stocks will get uplisted once they’re on the NASDAQ because it’s a massive exchange. MindMed was trading on the NEO exchange (smaller Canadian exchange) and OTC (over-the-counter) until today. Although they announced their plans to get uplisted (I believe) back in October."
2021-04-27 15:47:45,wallstreetbets,Where have you been lol? Stick with us and we will show you the way.
2021-04-27 16:45:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah I agree there but that guy that said shrooms are a party drug is completely wrong lol
2021-04-27 19:20:33,wallstreetbets,So I use etrade and RH. I could've bought thru them before today?
2021-04-27 19:39:47,wallstreetbets,I just keep buying too late!

2021-04-27 17:39:54,wallstreetbets,Anybody else remember how hyped GSAT was back in 2016-2018 era
2021-04-27 14:50:22,wallstreetbets,I’m loaded up on gsat it’s like 50 percent of my portfolio
2021-04-27 16:21:13,wallstreetbets,"I have been in this for a while. The value of the satellites they own that are currently in orbit, like functioning 5g satellites, are worth more than what the company is currently trading at. 



This isn't including any future growth of the 5g market, its simply based off the amount of satellites they have up in space already. Do your own DD, this is a solid company."

2021-04-27 14:53:34,wallstreetbets,"same! I have about 20k on GSAT, my avg is higher than current price but I don't have any doubts it will moon, its a solid company in a high growth industry![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)"
2021-04-27 15:28:05,wallstreetbets,Hedging my bet and have both in my portfolio. They’ve been dogs thus far but I keep adding a few hundred here and there when the dips happen. Maybe one day they’ll pay off. ;-)

2021-04-27 19:12:52,wallstreetbets,The only thing I hold firmly is dis cock🍆💎🙌
2021-04-27 14:01:25,wallstreetbets,Someone didn’t do any DD on MVIS
2021-04-27 14:02:45,wallstreetbets,Sold  160 shares and one call with a totally of 1k loss. I’m ok. I don’t need to lose all my money. All day it’s been down.
2021-04-27 19:54:44,wallstreetbets,"MVIS stock current phase

Selling the buy the rumor sell the news 😂"
2021-04-27 14:37:37,wallstreetbets,"Remember $RKT ???? Or BB or NOK or SNDL ,Apes have small brain but all know what is going to happen ,Exit was yesterday ,smart one took their profits already"

2021-04-27 14:33:48,wallstreetbets,So whale call at $17 ???
2021-04-27 14:52:19,wallstreetbets,Should I keep buying it or wait for Thursday?
2021-04-27 14:57:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the IV increase has been crazy. Stock increases $8, and my puts barely move. That's the only down side to your plan, assuming it does go up after sell off.

I think it will keep dropping though, so hopefully you get to exit at a good point."
2021-04-27 14:59:45,wallstreetbets,"i just sold itm credit spreads because naked call selling on wsb meme stocks is too scary, respect"

2021-04-27 16:24:51,wallstreetbets,Time to bust out the puts. .
2021-04-27 16:41:39,wallstreetbets,Can I get a small frosty?
2021-04-27 16:48:28,wallstreetbets,Love it. Bought a couple 30p eod yesterday and sold this morning for an easy $350. Prolly should’ve held longer but I’m a paperhanded bitch so that’s just what I do.
2021-04-27 17:34:46,wallstreetbets,😂 why will it tho?
2021-04-27 19:03:31,wallstreetbets,So you will lose money on the shares you own? Unless these are naked
2021-04-27 16:17:10,wallstreetbets,Can't wait for you to feel so fucking stupid hahahaha
2021-04-27 14:37:24,wallstreetbets,You are right. These 🤡 are chasing 😔
2021-04-27 14:00:31,wallstreetbets,😳
2021-04-27 14:05:40,wallstreetbets,"Not dumb, I'm expecting an institutional sell off on Thursday. Then I will close for whatever money I made and then ride superbullish call options up."
2021-04-27 16:14:12,wallstreetbets,💀💀💀🤣🤣
2021-04-27 14:55:47,wallstreetbets,I mean if it can I support you. That's not that bad for me. It just mean I would of sold my shares at the break even and thats not a bad gain at 200% IV.
2021-04-27 15:05:34,wallstreetbets,Well I can only lose on potential gains and I can only lose big if it drops considerably cause they are synthetic shorts.
2021-04-27 14:04:20,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah absolutely I'm expecting an institutional sell off on Thursday. I will close and then ride my shares.
2021-04-27 14:03:58,wallstreetbets,"since when has DD been reflective of what the stock actually does of late.

A company with solid fundamentals, good balance, no debt, profits, investors, good product - down 20%

Aerotyne international - up 60%

The market is a fucking casino now, more than it ever was."
2021-04-27 14:02:45,wallstreetbets,"I know exactly what MVIS is going through. But I'm expecting a sell off after news on Thursday after the run up.

I will close my positions and then ride with my shares."
2021-04-27 14:03:12,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if it’s not above 22$, he’s still up and can buy back in.

Given the IV, who fucking knows at this stage."
2021-04-27 14:16:27,wallstreetbets,Oh yea! Like BB... wait..
2021-04-27 14:28:16,wallstreetbets,Also thinking about it
2021-04-27 15:57:23,wallstreetbets,Sadly I'm not smart :(
2021-04-27 16:14:53,wallstreetbets,That's certainly the sentiment playing out this week. I got in at 11.50 awhile back so just holding out til 35 or so and see if these buyout rumours are true.
2021-04-27 14:40:39,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I mean it could go higher but not for at least a month.
2021-04-27 14:42:31,wallstreetbets,Now it's my time to milk fools.
2021-04-27 14:33:54,wallstreetbets,20.48 avg.
2021-04-27 14:34:52,wallstreetbets,So what do you mean? I firmly believe it will drop to a 17 dollar support level.
2021-04-27 14:53:34,wallstreetbets,I mean that's up too you. I stand to be wrong but to be honest it's been a 120% run up this week I can't see it going higher for much longer.
2021-04-27 15:01:57,wallstreetbets,Finger crossed. I mean it wouldnt be yolo or investing if it was a sure thing.
2021-04-27 15:03:31,wallstreetbets,It's not naked.
2021-04-27 15:30:17,wallstreetbets,Yes bigger player are taking profit from the bull run this week.
2021-04-27 16:30:57,wallstreetbets,I sold itm calls
2021-04-27 17:38:32,wallstreetbets,"As of right now, for some funds. They are sitting on ten baggers. They will let hype run up the price for Thursday and then dump the shares. Cause that is how you make money."
2021-04-27 16:30:12,wallstreetbets,Okay
2021-04-27 14:41:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah all the new people thinking it will go to 100 drive me nuts. Apparently 120% week run up is not enough.
2021-04-27 14:34:00,wallstreetbets,🤣
2021-04-27 14:33:59,wallstreetbets,"Smart. This is de way.

Covered positions ez win"
2021-04-27 14:48:51,wallstreetbets,But how can u make any money if u close in the negative??
2021-04-27 19:17:05,wallstreetbets,Big brain ape 🧠🧠🦧🦍🍌🍌🍌
2021-04-27 14:09:51,wallstreetbets,Ride’em! 😁👍🏼
2021-04-27 19:05:51,wallstreetbets,What makes you think they will sell on Thursday
2021-04-27 14:08:12,wallstreetbets,"I'm actually very worried about this, if IV continues to rise I won't be able to buy my options back for a profit at 17."
2021-04-27 14:24:15,wallstreetbets,Exactly 9 out of 10 run up like this don't continue and drop to a support level. I'm expect at 17-ish for a while.
2021-04-27 14:35:48,wallstreetbets,Just short like I did.
2021-04-27 19:09:08,wallstreetbets,Why do you firmly believe that
2021-04-27 14:54:24,wallstreetbets,I’m playing with fake money right now. I will do whatever lol. I just want to see how high I can get
2021-04-27 15:00:37,wallstreetbets,It keeps going down lmao. What should I do
2021-04-27 16:28:01,wallstreetbets,I agree it was a big red day for us to chew on
2021-04-27 16:08:13,wallstreetbets,Well I took my little $60 of cash available and reinvested it this morning. Lol
2021-04-27 16:12:31,wallstreetbets,I still have all my stock though
2021-04-27 17:44:36,wallstreetbets,I barely can ride a bike after learning twice. I’m just holding GME and NOK. I was really thinking about this one but can’t rationalize it Because it seems like another ploy from the MM’s
2021-04-27 16:20:09,wallstreetbets,"They’ll downvote you to shit, but it’s the truth. Can’t tell you how many “xyz will be @ $xxx by end of day tomorrow” posts I see on a daily. Someone said “AMD earnings today; $100 eod”….bro, really? AMD has literally never gone up 20% in a day, regardless of earnings. A lot of folks got introduced to the stock market via GME and think everything that’s running is an infinite squeeze."
2021-04-27 14:54:02,wallstreetbets,That's a credit. Meaning I have been given that money.
2021-04-27 14:11:13,wallstreetbets,"Probably not, just hope the IV gods are with you and it swings down on expiration day."
2021-04-27 14:46:52,wallstreetbets,"I bought 10p and 13p, fuck your couch"
2021-04-27 15:09:48,wallstreetbets,"If I can make a suggestion, go ahead and use real money. I paper traded for years and missed out on so much tesla, AMD, and so on.

Just go for it.

Be smart.

And don't stop learning more."
2021-04-27 15:17:42,wallstreetbets,"Buy 100 shares, sell a covered call, and buy a put.

You can limit losses, and still make money.

I lost all my money being stupid bullish on the APHA merger, so don't mistake this for good advice.

I bought $13p when MVIS was around $24 or $25. I plan to sell after earnings. Theta is pretty brutal."
2021-04-27 15:07:32,wallstreetbets,"Do you expect it to keep dropping?

Man, I'm not you. Use the info and make informed decisions. My synthetic shorts are to protect my shares drop in value cause I know I bought them at a high point."
2021-04-27 14:55:18,wallstreetbets,Ohh ok. ☹
2021-04-27 14:15:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm not holding to expiration, I'm strictly holding this position till after the institutional sell off. I severely doubt MVIS will remain at 17 till end of march."
2021-04-27 15:08:16,wallstreetbets,"I bought $13p also. Godspeed, retard."
2021-04-27 15:27:14,wallstreetbets,Please no.... It can drop but not that far.
2021-04-27 16:15:42,wallstreetbets,I’m averaging in low teens on Friday if not I will keep an eye for a short at 40 and up unless it’s from buy out or major good earnings news.  Scouting for the next penny rocket now.
2021-04-27 15:10:50,wallstreetbets,Alrighty. I got dis
2021-04-27 14:21:48,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, Going to sell my May calls at 35 strike on next up day. Although I’m planning to hold and continuously scoop premium."
2021-04-27 17:05:45,wallstreetbets,47x19p 21 May agree with you.
2021-04-27 17:38:48,wallstreetbets,"What is this ""  institutional sell off "" you speak of if I may ask?

Is it just for this underlying or you talking the whole market? And why Thursday?"
2021-04-27 15:46:08,wallstreetbets,debating on selling some 10p LEAPS to buy back when IV tanks and it takes off
2021-04-27 14:22:33,wallstreetbets,Oh I know man that IV is so good right now!
2021-04-27 17:16:02,wallstreetbets,Sold or bought?
2021-04-27 14:23:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, figured 20$ end of year will be reasonable to maintain profit at a 14$ buy in."
2021-04-27 14:50:42,wallstreetbets,I sold 6x 30$ calls for july last friday... fml. I missed out literally on 5k in premium yesterday

2021-04-27 14:40:57,wallstreetbets,"As someone that dealt with anxiety and depression, it was completely wiped away after two rounds with dmt. I’ll try my best to explain the “reset” someone else commented on, but you feel more alive like when you were a teenager and saw hope and possibility in front of you.  

Just giving someone that opportunity to view the world again before the negativity took over is what will change the world.  I’m not joking when I say that if 30-40% of the population microdosed, we would be so much better off.  

This is def a long hold."

2021-04-27 16:43:55,wallstreetbets,I was a violent teenager with a horrible anger problem and hate for the world. I was addicted to opioid from a previous hand injury/surgery and headed down a bad path. Had tried shrooms and acid before but never really enjoyed them because setting and peer pressure. My buddy came to my house with a half gram of DMT and we both vaporized it and I blasted so far away from my body that when I came back I literally had a hard time processing what just happened to me. I cried harder than I ever have in my life and ever since then I've stayed sober and successful. I'm happy and have meaningful realtionships and gained a massive amount of empathy for people and the earth. I love animals and reconnected woth my family as well. I've always said that I think that the world would change if these substances were studied and added modern medical practice. 450 at 4.64 let's heal this world 🌎 🍄 🚀🌙 💎 👊

These tools can break down the bullshit barriers that living life in our current world creates for us, most of the time, without our control.  As with anything you should probably use in moderation but one of the best trips I’ve ever had was when I accidentally dropped about 5 hits of LSD and I discovered more about myself and life in that 24 hours than I had in 30 years of life experience.

So it may not be profitable, but but there are always new people in the world and they live in this crazy culture that makes them depressed so they won't have many repeat customers other than microdosers,but new customers will continue. Unless the customers that had the experience go on to change the world and the source of depression."

2021-04-27 17:18:11,wallstreetbets,"This is great news. Low-dose psychedelics give you similar benefits to adderal, for example, with virtually no side effects and almost zero potential for addiction.

I actually remember having this conversation with some friends I tripped with and I see it isn't just me thinking the same."
2021-04-27 18:47:31,wallstreetbets,In no way does this make it a good investment.
2021-04-27 15:28:18,wallstreetbets,CNN. Cant take it seriously.

2021-04-27 17:08:00,wallstreetbets,Great idea but aren’t they light years from being profitable as a valid investment
2021-04-27 17:17:04,wallstreetbets,"Super noob here....I'd love to start some very small and very light trading...maybe this stock would be a first?!  I'm not going to start on robinhood seeing how they dicked everyone with the GME fiasco. So that being said, where should I go to trade stocks on a small level ($200-$1000 here and there).  Thanks!"
2021-04-27 18:33:30,wallstreetbets,That made me kind of emotional. JR did a good job. There is no ill will with what Mind Med is doing. It's only a matter of time that the rest of the world realizes this.
2021-04-27 14:22:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah anyone that watches CNN is on Shrooms IRL lol
2021-04-27 15:07:48,wallstreetbets,"But how is MNMD gonna benefit from legalization? Shrooms are illegal here in CA but an oz of the best shrooms is about 90% cheaper than weed ounces. On top of people microdose instead of blazing weed everyday. On top of mushrooms being easier to grow than weed....



So how does MNMD make billions of dollars from all of this? Any drug company can replicate what MNMD will do once shrooms becomes legal, and it doesn't matter where you get your shrooms from, especially since I know about 100 shroom growers and this shit isn't even legal in CA so how the fuck is MNMD going to somehow sell shrooms that are going to be far more expensive? Or how would they undercut all the people who can grow shrooms dirt fucking cheap?"
2021-04-27 14:06:04,wallstreetbets,"I went into that video with an open mind.

Right up until the point the CEO comes on wearing a suit jacket and a MindMed t-shirt.

Spat my coffee out and crossed MNMD off my list."
2021-04-27 14:05:40,wallstreetbets,Gotta keep those voters & viewers stoned.
2021-04-27 15:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Gonna say something unpopular on this sub, but if people want to invest in behavioral therapy, seems like it would be better to understand current society’s need to pop pills, smoke pot, take a drug or pill for every ache or distress. People can manage feelings, anxiety, disappointment, life without being high, but no one wants to anymore. For that reason I opted out of this play."
2021-04-27 16:35:47,wallstreetbets,"Dafuq, i never thought LSD is the last thing that could help with mental health, what are those retard CNN people smoking?"
2021-04-27 15:04:41,wallstreetbets,looks like today they are too slow in realizing anything.
2021-04-27 15:57:50,wallstreetbets,Where can MNMD be bought in the UK? I use HL and etoro but they don't have it listed...

2021-04-27 18:27:26,wallstreetbets,What a fantastic interview! Props to the interviewer who actually seemed interested and asked good questions in a non-condescending  manner. This very well could be the future of medicine
2021-04-27 18:31:26,wallstreetbets,"But you can’t be on anti depressants when you take dmt, correct?"

2021-04-27 18:41:31,wallstreetbets,They had a net loss of $35M last year. The only catalyst is them getting an fda approval isn’t it?
2021-04-27 18:41:49,wallstreetbets,I purchased on NEO under MMED. Do my shares just transfer over? I really want to get into this long term. So much potential.

2021-04-27 19:09:41,wallstreetbets,Shrooms and LSD have changed my life as well as many others. It’s time for Americans to fall down the rabbit hole and get on board with these life hack drugs. I’m all in with MNMD I think this is a good way to push forward with helping people.
2021-04-27 19:09:48,wallstreetbets,Robinhood says that they have zero employees.  I’m in!

What really blew my mind was that years later, I met my current girlfriend and she had told me a story of one of her friends who had the same condition and could distinguish between the two colors! I never tols her about my friend having the same anecdotal findings.
I am not aware of any research done on this topic, but if not, then I bet there is huge potential here."

2021-04-27 17:54:59,wallstreetbets,"I was going to buy in on Monday but it was already up too much by then and I figured it was close to the top, and sure enough its gone to hell. Glad I stayed out of that one."
2021-04-27 15:29:09,wallstreetbets,"Yes. I had my anxiety essentially wiped away from a random LSD trip. Not my first one, and nothing revelational took place. But, the next day I just didn't have anxiety. And, any depression that was causing faded away aswell. The potential with some of these drugs are beyond description."
2021-04-27 15:41:54,wallstreetbets,"being an extremely anxious/depressed person myself, it always boggles my mind when people tell stories like this. to me in my current state, it just seems so outlandish that a round or two of psychedelics can just completely reset someone's neurochemistry like this. this is why im so on board with MMED, i really hope that this can become a mainstream thing where I don't need to feel skeptical anymore. I would do anything to not be an anxious/depressed fuck anymore."
2021-04-27 15:40:16,wallstreetbets,I took 5g psilocybin this weekend camping and felt like God.  Completely unfucked myself.  If I can take this shit daily without the hallucinations I'll pay top $$ and know a lot of others who would do the same.
2021-04-27 14:57:01,wallstreetbets,"It's like clearing your own cache and cookies in your brain. Think of how your computer stores too much of that shit and it starts to slow it down, and we need to clear it out and then the PC runs hella smooth...just like my brain texture ;)"
2021-04-27 16:16:59,wallstreetbets,I took LSD for the first time in college and it completely changed my perspective on the world for the better. The experience genuinely lead me to be a better person and I often look back at it as the turning point in which I became who I am today. I don’t think psychedelics are for everyone and you definitely need to be in the right mindset when you take them as they can be truly life altering but they open the door to a lot of positivity and lead to enlightening experiences.
2021-04-27 15:00:40,wallstreetbets,Except for some people with depression looking for a cure in psychedelics can cause intense anxiety and panic attacks. That’s why this research is so important to me.
2021-04-27 15:54:57,wallstreetbets,"I've been waiting for a solid psychedelics play. shrooms and lsd have helped me a ton. I'm in and very optimistic, especially considering all the legalization legislation going around lately."
2021-04-27 16:11:50,wallstreetbets,"very well said, the lack of research due to the war on drugs, politics, big pharmacy etc is really a travesty"
2021-04-27 18:24:19,wallstreetbets,Shrooms saved my life. I have had depression for over 10 years and was suicidal.  I haven’t taken antidepressants since.   I can’t explain it very well;  its kind of like shedding an old skin that was uncomfortable.
2021-04-27 17:02:06,wallstreetbets,I need that in my life. So badly.
2021-04-27 15:57:30,wallstreetbets,How often do you micro dose?
2021-04-27 19:49:52,wallstreetbets,"This saved a friend from killing himself. Upon learning about this company and RLTF I went elbows deep on them. 

Folks need real alternates than current medicine that causes major side effects. Once I tried CBD and THC tinctures for pain, I was 110% sold on these approaches which have been demonized until recently."

On top of people microdose instead of blazing weed everyday. On top of mushrooms being easier to grow than weed....



So how does MNMD make billions of dollars from all of this? Any drug company can replicate what MNMD will do once shrooms becomes legal, and it doesn't matter where you get your shrooms from, especially since I know about 100 shroom growers and this shit isn't even legal in CA so how the fuck is MNMD going to somehow sell shrooms that are going to be far more expensive? Or how would they undercut all the people who can grow shrooms dirt fucking cheap?"
2021-04-27 16:50:16,wallstreetbets,Do you only dose those 2 times? Or long term micro use
2021-04-27 17:39:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I can second that!  Believe me, the stuff works.  I discovered psilocybin a few years ago and it has changed my life.  I seriously think it can become a ""mental wellness"" treatment for everyone, not just people with mental health issues."
2021-04-27 17:40:59,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. And until the fda approves microdosing, you can also try to maintain a .05 blood alcohol content, or micro drinking.  There's a lot of researching suggesting .05 alcohol is the perfect amount to make you more effective at work and home, live a happier life, and be better overall."

2021-04-27 14:36:24,wallstreetbets,"the company was previously in the OTC market and previously to the listing, day traders brought it and are now closing their position, but that doesn't change the long term potential of the company. it's a matter of time until institutional investors get in. Like with Tesla the company was initially supported only by retail investors, especially by people that personally used psychedelics to cure their depression/anxiety. Like mentioned in the interview, institutional investors are more careful to invest in a ""LSD"" company, but it a good chance for us to get in early, and it's only a matter of time until ""boomers get it"""
2021-04-27 14:37:48,wallstreetbets,It's still up 100% from a week ago. I assume dip is a combo of people taking profits and whales shorting it to drive the price down so they can buy in lower.

Also for more advanced depression like electroshock convulsive therapy (ECT), psychedelics can reset your brain chemistry (like a computer). same principle with addiction, 18-mc a drug that they working on, can reset your chemistry and heal you with several doses from opioid addiction."

Now I’m in amazing shape, frugal yet able to put that extra money in the market, about to start college for business, and most of all: I feel happier than ever! And I wouldn’t be here without those experiences. They don’t magically fix everything, but they will show you the way and bring your ambition and goals front and center. It’s always going to be up to you to act upon them, but that catalyst is amazing. There’s nothing truly quite like it out there. It might not be a one size fits all approach, but as someone below me said: that’s what this research and trials are for. It’s definitely better than not being able to have these things, but with expert knowledge it could bring a whole new era of thinking. “Food of the Gods” by Terence McKenna describes a theory how humans might have possibly evolved from apes that ate psychedelic mushrooms during a period of rainforest recession.

2021-04-27 15:42:47,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. I know people who it has helped immensely, and others who had a really bad experience and their life was changed in a negative way. Most of those bad ones were either overdoses or people being pressured to take a psychedelic drug when they were not comfortable with it.

  
Hopefully we learn more about it as time goes by. There is a lot of research being done right now.;"
2021-04-27 17:16:45,wallstreetbets,The 18-mc they are testing is not psychedelic but it appears to decouple the reward pathways in your brain similar to psychedelics so if it's effective that could be a game changer in world full of addicts.
2021-04-27 17:54:45,wallstreetbets,I found that a lot of bad trips happen due to a poor environment.  Doing Shrooms with close friends in a beautiful outdoor setting is way safer and pleasant compared to  doing it in a basement alone.
2021-04-27 15:28:59,wallstreetbets,You need someone to bring it to the mainstream in a publicly traded company. Pfizer or J and j could never bring this out publicly but they wouldn’t be as chastised if they bought mindmed in the future and become part of the solution.
2021-04-27 15:36:14,wallstreetbets,Listen the interview.. he is not trying to make money of selling shrooms (other companies are going down that path) but MNMD is using technology and science to broaden the industry and make these therapies more readily available across the globe.. theres a much bigger picture here if you look into it.
2021-04-27 17:32:52,wallstreetbets,"You need to do research. They arent selling psycadelics for casual use, this is treatment and medicibe using the positives of psycadelics while trying to remove the downsides. They have patents on their extraction process abd tge way they create these medicines.

2021-04-27 19:05:04,wallstreetbets,"Becauee shares don’t offer the same risk reward that options do. For example I can buy only 40 shares with $200. If I however spend my $200 on options, those options could be $1 each, or even .15c each. And if they are $1 each I get 200 shares for $200 and if they are .15c a piece I get 1300 shares. 
See what I mean about risk reward? You get more from your money when you buy options rather than stock. If you wanted to buy 1300 shares of MNMD you would have to spend like 5k. That’s a lot of money to have held up in your account, plus it’s a lot to risk. Whereas $200 gets me the same amount of shares for a fraction of the risk."

Shrooms are cheaper and easier to grow than weed and currently an ounce of shrooms is far cheaper than an oz of weed where I live (And weed's legal). Pharma companies have literally fucked up every single man made anti depression drug, the research for microdosing doing wonders is already out there, why would messing with an already perfect forumula be any better? JNJ/Phizer can just create their own varient  for pennies on the dollar, they are the ones with worldwide connections and already have every logistic down"

2021-04-27 17:50:51,wallstreetbets,You have to do the work to fix what's wrong in your life.  Psychedelics will open the door for that and give you a fresh perspective on personal problems that depression and anxiety are hiding.  A good trip gives you hope that you didn't have before.
2021-04-27 17:55:37,wallstreetbets,micro dosing changed my life. Amazing changes in a short time period.
2021-04-27 19:17:49,wallstreetbets,Mushrooms gave me a chance to ask myself why does my brain work the way it does. Realized I've had an anxiety disorder all along. It didn't fix it but I became more aware of the causes and symptoms. A hard acid trip from time to time keeps me level headed and resets my brain after high stress
2021-04-27 19:52:19,wallstreetbets,I see alot of people saying that it came back after so many months. My anxiety that I had really bad during my younger years never came back after my first LSD trip. To each their own I guess

2021-04-27 17:14:43,wallstreetbets,"I grew up in a pretty poor household, experienced violence and abuse at a young age, moved a lot, etc... so I had a sorta me vs the world mentality and thought little of others as a youth. I carried this mentality into my late teens though after a some run ins with the law at 13-14 I had eased up quite a bit but still carried a lot of that pressure and frustration. LSD was an enlightening experience for me as for the first time in my life that I truly felt one with the world around me, like I wasn’t alone because everything was connected (I literally felt like I was melting into my surroundings). I think my studies in philosophy (which was my major) may have left me more open to the experience and free to let go of any inhibitions I may have had going into it but for me it was life changing. I sometimes still get fits of depression but I am able to look at myself and others so much more honestly and it has given me a level of joy never could have dreamt of as a kid."
2021-04-27 17:44:10,wallstreetbets,You have to be in the right frame of mind.  Be open to the experience and let it take you where you need to go.
2021-04-27 15:59:55,wallstreetbets,"So let me first state, this dude JR Rahn seems like an amazing guy.  I genuinely hope he succeeds because the world desperately needs what he's trying to bring to market.

That said, I need to put my investor skeptic goggles on for a sec.  Don't often the first few people to fight this type of battle spend tons of money and resources on it?  Sorta benefits the consumer and industry like crazy but I feel like it's risky and expensive.

You get the pioneer, name recognition and early entrant advantage.  True but there are lots of political hurdles and I feel like it might compete with existing drug companies which might make it even harder."
2021-04-27 16:44:27,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t answer his question at all. Basically how will this ever be profitable when mushrooms are extremely cheap to grow and can’t be patented and don’t have the recreational demand like weed. Yes I know people use them recreationally but it’s infrequent and probably wont be legal for rec use in our lifetime anyway.
2021-04-27 17:11:42,wallstreetbets,If the 18-mc they're testing ends up being effective in treating every addiction under the sun from opoid addiction (that's huge) to smoking and overeating all without actual psychedelic side effects that would be MASSIVE.

2021-04-27 18:52:42,wallstreetbets,"Yup that was one for me too. I’ve found that when I’m really stuck with anxiety, a two day “trip” works the best. Day one I take 1 tab to knock some things loose, and day two I take a  3-4 tab sledge hammer to knock the rest of it down. That gets me about 2-3 months free of depression and anxiety. It normally comes back, but therapy has helped with that as well."
2021-04-27 17:29:15,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-27 18:01:47,wallstreetbets,I totally agree. It seem like that's just not possible for some people. Like how some can't smoke weed because of anxiety or paranoia. I wonder if microdosing or slowly doing more and more over time would solve that dilemma (as far as shrooms go). Make them more comfortable with the idea through multiple subtle experiences.
2021-04-27 18:41:28,wallstreetbets,"There is one thing he said that makes me bearish, and that's healthcare inequality when it comes to psychiatry. Remember when we were winding down all the afghanistan stuff? It was a huge deal that vets were reaching out to VA for help with ptsd/depression and either got ghosted or told there weren't resources to diagnose or treat them. Then we ended up with 10k? suicides from these untreated mental health problems. What a disaster! And it wasn't like anti-depressants weren't out there, it's that the diagnosis+prescription infrastructure for people who couldn't afford ""luxuries"" like mental care sucked, just like Rahn said.

Frankly, that (and legislator prejudice ofc) are things that mindmed can't fix, but they're also its biggest hurdles. As an investor, I'm not a fan of this situation."
2021-04-27 16:52:51,wallstreetbets,"Where is your source that they can’t be patented?  

The amount of people that would take mushrooms like they would pills once established as a form of treatment far outweighs those who would attempt to grow their own and treat themselves."

2021-04-27 18:08:07,wallstreetbets,I certainly hope they do not get bought out and rather continue development of their own compounds. Last thing we need is big pharma locking up patents with no intent to research just to continue the money roll of their other drugs. Just my 2 cents
2021-04-27 17:29:21,wallstreetbets,"You should look at what subreddit you're in.  Advocating for investment in a psychopharmacological manufacturer on the basis of 'they're more trustworthy than modern pharma comps because of anecdotal evidence and studies done in the 50's' is one of the worst takes I've heard on reddit ever.  I'm glad there's a company out there who is doing research on potential consumer use of psychedelics, but I would never give a recommendation to invest in that company, especially with that kind of logic.

1)  they have no viable product.  

2)  their commodity is illegal in most parts of the country.

3)  the dangerous side effects are very real, meaning that the best-case scenario is that they'll make a product that requires a prescription.  Psychedelics have extremely dangerous contraindications with a wide variety of prescription drugs.  We're at least a decade away from having an understanding of the full scope of those effects.

4)  the medical benefits may very well be entirely illusory.  Some people who use psychedelics feel better.  Great!  I'd also feel better if I completely detached myself from reality once in a while."
2021-04-27 19:54:28,wallstreetbets,"I think the point is that with a brand new compound, there is nothing to go on, as far as actual impact on actual humans, until you put it in an actual human. With this, we have plenty of anecdotal evidence of success in humans. That does give some indication of the compound's potential. And you can weigh that however you like, but it's more data than we start with when trying to decide if a new compound will work."
2021-04-27 19:57:04,wallstreetbets,1 option contract is the equivalent of 100 shares. If any option only costs .10c then $100 gets you 1000 shares. I promise you this is how options works. If you don’t believe me get on your brokerage account and see for yourself.

2021-04-27 19:18:18,wallstreetbets,I read somewhere that FDA approval for MNMD is not a real hurdle but that seems a bit sus.  Hasn't it been extremely difficult to even test hallucinogens?
2021-04-27 17:23:14,wallstreetbets,My point is once it’s approved for medical use what’s to stop 1000 other companies from doing the same thing since they can easily grow mushrooms themselves for next to nothing. Maybe you can patent a certain “strain” of mushrooms like you can with weed but just like in the weed industry you wouldn’t be able to mark it up 10x cuz there are a million other companies selling essentially the same thing for cheap.
2021-04-27 17:45:24,wallstreetbets,I know that. My point is this won’t ever be used daily on a large scale like marijuana. And it’s a natural fungus that grows from the ground so it’s not like they can charge a lot of money for it unless they find a way to patent it and only their patent is approved for medical use which is not what happened in the weed industry.

2021-04-27 18:44:40,wallstreetbets,"Basically they're tools n its very easy for them to go south despite that being apart of how they help you. Sure you can trip on yer own. Id imagine in future and also hope that its only legal w therapist help but not yer traditional therapist, they should be decriminalised tho so people can use them on their own. Id recommended a therapist tho or a priest"
2021-04-27 18:48:31,wallstreetbets,They're not mainstream because they have the potential to wake masses of people up to their social conditioning and programming. You begin to realize the government doesn't have your best interest in mind. Yes it may be obvious  many people here but psychedelics make it terrifyingly obvious in my experience.
2021-04-27 17:40:14,wallstreetbets,That isn’t how it works in the weed industry tho

2021-04-27 19:09:35,wallstreetbets,"I’ve dealt with persistent suicidal thoughts since I was about 12, if it wasn’t for psychedelics, it’s very unlikely I’d be alive today, they can’t fix everything, but it is infinitely more effective than traditional psych meds, my epilepsy medicine ironically actually encourages suicidal thoughts, so psychedelics do wonders at balancing that"
2021-04-27 13:53:13,wallstreetbets,The first paragraph is good enough to convince me.

Okay guys. 

This is big. 

~~Microvision is in Redmond, what else is in Redmond? Microsoft. Micro-vision, Micro-soft. Coincidence?~~

~~Microsoft leads in augmented reality hardware with its holo-lens and could use Lidar sensors to further improve its environment mapping. Just in February '21 Microsoft released its industrial edition model of the lens so it's still in active development. These guys currently use camera sensors for the HoloLens based on the Kinect, but as they want to lead in industrial augmented reality applications, there are still advantages to lidar systems that they do not use. As an example, the current 3D-object resolution is not high enough to detect my Micro-penis (coincidence?), therefore it is missing out on potential applications in the pornographic industry. Imagine buying an ogre of a hooker that actually looks like Shrek thanks to holo-lens. $MVIS can make this happen. There were rumors of acquisition back in September that Microsoft denied, however they were lying because Bill Gates planted microchips in their vaccines probably.~~

~~TLDR; More sensors = more rockets. This is a marriage counselling service for cucks. $MVIS moon.~~

~~Thoughts?~~

OK OK! You made your sale!

2021-04-27 18:31:15,wallstreetbets,How the fuck did I miss this
2021-04-27 18:41:47,wallstreetbets,I bought at market open at 5.58 but I like the stock and support what MNMD is doing. I’m in for the long haul.

2021-04-27 14:39:37,wallstreetbets,Do you guys think it’s gonna soar any time soon?
2021-04-27 16:02:43,wallstreetbets,"Yea idk haha this legit just feels like a great long term hold lmfao. I don't get the constant ""to the moon"" sentiment 😅 

My position in MNMD is only 2% of my account so definitely not too worried about the short term. People that fucking YOLOed and went all in when it was above $5 however.... 

🤷"
2021-04-27 14:43:16,wallstreetbets,Definitely not owned majority by people who got in that cheap and the same reason you list... people who payed $.05-$2 wanted to take profits at $5+ so it’s going to have its first big profit taking sell off as it finds its new value. Give it time there’s no reason to ask why the answer is simple.
2021-04-27 15:37:31,wallstreetbets,"Yo compre 150 a un precio 4,31"

2021-04-27 14:14:50,wallstreetbets,Hope it goes back under a $1 today too

I average 4.50, hope to average down some tomorrow."

2021-04-27 17:06:46,wallstreetbets,"Well, the vibe from yesterday heavily implied that it was going to rocket in the very near term. People that do their research know what they’re in for, people that know the hype are asking why they’re in the red."
2021-04-27 14:55:32,wallstreetbets,That's great! I've bought more as well.
2021-04-27 16:08:57,wallstreetbets,It’s funny watching wsb turn into “long term investors” lol

2021-04-27 14:43:21,wallstreetbets,Hm. I’m playing the stock game on market watch that’s why I was asking for specifically that one. Odd. Do you know why it’s not on market watch?

2021-04-27 18:41:13,wallstreetbets,I see it as $MMED. Is there another? Everyone is referring to $MNMD that I can't find.
2021-04-27 19:05:14,wallstreetbets,It was listed on other markets as MMED today is the first day it traded on Nasdaq as MNMD same stock different markets.
2021-04-27 13:59:24,wallstreetbets,"Ouch, that's a lot in one day. 

I've gotten hammered by 60% losses same day before too it sucks just watching it drop and not stop before your eyes"
2021-04-27 14:15:24,wallstreetbets,I’m right there with you. Except mine are FDs.
2021-04-27 14:10:49,wallstreetbets,Frustrating when these stocks keep tanking on good earnings releases. Been a trend this year...
2021-04-27 14:53:30,wallstreetbets,Just one Elon tweet away from break even
2021-04-27 15:55:52,wallstreetbets,Bro I am 740$c and i am sweating my balls April 30 will rip me off
2021-04-27 13:46:17,wallstreetbets,And that's why I'm confused by options...you owe that much?
2021-04-27 15:57:46,wallstreetbets,I know what a call and put option is but I can’t decipher this ancient text please help
2021-04-27 16:09:01,wallstreetbets,It's happened to most people
2021-04-27 16:27:29,wallstreetbets,"Options confuse the shit out of me, how the hell is he down that much by buying just 8 contracts? I bought 6x 940c for May '22 and thats roughly 6,50€ (roughly 8$) combined. What am I missing here?"
2021-04-27 13:55:43,wallstreetbets,Ahh shit happens
2021-04-27 14:01:33,wallstreetbets,haha i saw it drop 4% AH during call and knew i was in for a beating
2021-04-27 14:21:28,wallstreetbets,"thinking 800 calls have a chance, i dunno though i went the retard way with this one"
2021-04-27 17:41:11,wallstreetbets,"I just bought may 7 calls. 740 or something. 

Thought it was dip 🤡🤡🤡. 

I’m ready to get pegged."
2021-04-27 13:47:07,wallstreetbets,Nah he‘s down 8k from initial value of 12k i believe
2021-04-27 14:23:45,wallstreetbets,"With options you can only lose your premium. When you make money on options it's because the premium of your specific contract has increased because the stock price has made the option contract more profitable (e.g. someone would have to pay more for the option contract today than you did when you bought it). Simply stated, that occurs when the option is in the money and you own the right to purchase 100 shares at a price lower than the market price.

This guy spent $13,590 to purchase the options and they have lost value because the stock price is moving away from the strike price, meaning his contracts are cheaper to buy today than they were when he bought them. If it gets closer to May 21 and they still are out of the money they will likely expire worthless (meaning no one will pay to buy them)."
2021-04-27 14:09:17,wallstreetbets,"I am too, is the $850 him betting the stock price would go up to $850?"
2021-04-27 17:46:22,wallstreetbets,"There is no way you bought a 940c with 4 ‘22 expiry for 8$

TSLA literally doesnt have that dated calls but more importantly those costs right now 120$. That’s 12,000 per contract. Where the hell did you buy them for 8$???? 

Im like 100% sure you are confusing something here because 6 940c TSLA at ‘22 is worth around 100,000$"
2021-04-27 13:49:46,wallstreetbets,Egzackary ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
2021-04-27 17:28:36,wallstreetbets,I guess in a round about way- he DOES owe that much  and has to pay it- it’s just paying it instantly.
2021-04-27 17:39:14,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Massively over simplyfing but every dollar above 850 TSLA gains is 500$ profit. Just on the first contract. 

So 851= 500

852= 1000

900= 50,000

TSLA at 1,000= 100,000$

(Don’t @ me retards, I know this is not how it works but it’s simplicity. No need for IV or delta or Extrinsic value)"
2021-04-27 18:51:11,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit, so that's why they're so profitable. One more question, where does the $500 figure come in here? I don't see anything in the image that would indicate $500 profit."
2021-04-27 14:07:37,wallstreetbets,Same strike here but 2023 expiration. Let’s shop for lambos together.
2021-04-27 16:43:46,wallstreetbets,Well it’ll either be a mansion or a trailer park.. good luck retard

2021-04-27 18:29:58,wallstreetbets,Citi just upgraded after hours. This isn’t a terrible idea
2021-04-27 19:58:23,wallstreetbets,Also check out /r/VIAC for some super solid DD
2021-04-27 14:44:51,wallstreetbets,I am a viac holder and bought more yesterday. I only buy shares and don't hold any options.
2021-04-27 14:58:32,wallstreetbets,Ive got options all the way from june to january.  I want to retire.  Best of luck boys
2021-04-27 14:22:08,wallstreetbets,I bought in a week before the final drop. All strike price of 42.5. ITM now and climbing steadily. I don’t suspect it goes beyond 60. If it does magnificent. If not tendie town here we come.
2021-04-27 15:24:49,wallstreetbets,This thing is easily worth over 100 if you compare it to nflx or roku. Another DD here said they have similar profits to nflx but have 1/10 the market cap and have similar/more ad revenue than roku but have 1/2 the market cap.

2021-04-27 13:44:13,wallstreetbets,He has a few months until he worries about theta. In December he can look at his gains or losses and decide to sell before theta fucks
2021-04-27 13:49:52,wallstreetbets,What is theta guys
2021-04-27 17:15:25,wallstreetbets,"S&P average PE is 28 but that's way above traditional average.

If there is a big correction that average PE will drop and rightly so."
2021-04-27 19:31:18,wallstreetbets,I hope so. Good luck.

2021-04-27 17:16:17,wallstreetbets,Y'all don't think it can reach 50 by june 18?
2021-04-27 14:44:44,wallstreetbets,"Why did you go with 2023 instead of 2022?  Looks like it costs about twice as much. Can you break down your thinking, or the numbers, for me?  Appreciate it!"

2021-04-27 17:12:43,wallstreetbets,Reading through these comments. Every single one of you fucks asking about theta needs to go to r/options learn and then come back. This shits sad.
2021-04-27 15:12:01,wallstreetbets,Ive had it for a month but it seems very targeted for children and sports. I used it to watch showtime TV shows and when the NFL is on
2021-04-27 15:26:06,wallstreetbets,Binges inkmaster and canceled. Not enough diversity yet to make it worth it for me.

2021-04-27 19:37:17,wallstreetbets,It'll be 50 by next week.

2021-04-27 16:42:15,wallstreetbets,When you go that far out its not much more expensive to choose an expiry another year later. This is true for all options btw
2021-04-27 17:15:17,wallstreetbets,Or... r/thetagang?
2021-04-27 15:16:51,wallstreetbets,Theta won't bother me until 2 months out.
2021-04-27 14:52:48,wallstreetbets,Oh well learned something. I’ll keep this in mind on my 500 strike SPY calls for 1/2022
2021-04-27 15:59:32,wallstreetbets,"Theta decay has a pretty gradual slope until you get closer to expiration. Impact of theta slope in September on a January opt option won't be that significant. Mid November things will start to get ugly.

It only matters if OP is wrong about price action though."
2021-04-27 17:10:09,wallstreetbets,Yes about midway decay will ramp up. Hell be fine.

2021-04-27 13:52:13,wallstreetbets,You are out of the money ? That’s not a LEAP
2021-04-27 19:48:57,wallstreetbets,Bought a 45c expiring 9/17 earlier. Let’s go!!!
2021-04-27 17:21:53,wallstreetbets,Hahaha. Yup. I’m getting downvoted. Wsb is full of children and crybabies. The fuck.
2021-04-27 19:55:25,wallstreetbets,I'm use to buying options 2-3 weeks ago. I personally won't notice Theta until around late Nov/Dec. But by then I'm hoping these are far enough ITM it won't matter
2021-04-27 15:13:49,wallstreetbets,That’s the true retard way. Find this sub and do a yolo and win and now you’re back for more but after the losses you think you need to start to learn the terms and technicals. Love it.
2021-04-27 14:55:11,wallstreetbets,LEAPs give you more leverage but you have to pay for the extrinsic value. If you are very confident in a position buying LEAPs can make sense.

2021-04-27 15:17:56,wallstreetbets,It's not fully 1 year buts it's close enough for a Long-term equity anticipation securities. The strike price doesn't matter
2021-04-27 18:58:08,wallstreetbets,Losses are just diagnostics
2021-04-27 15:33:39,wallstreetbets,"Bro the concept of a leaps is to purchase deep in the money, to simulate owning the shares. I mean I like the trade and I hope you crush it. But you can’t say Theta Doesn’t matter, when you are 25% Out of the Money! VIAC could move 20% and you could still lose every penny."
2021-04-27 15:43:22,wallstreetbets,"LEAPS have nothing to do with strike price. And 90% of theta decay happens in the last 30 days.

2021-04-27 13:55:32,wallstreetbets,I fully plan on buying that truck when its available.
2021-04-27 14:05:58,wallstreetbets,RIDE is the only thing I'm green on right now.
2021-04-27 14:28:12,wallstreetbets,Yea they did so well at the Baja race when their truck broke down after less than 1/5 of race completed. Garbage company and product.
2021-04-27 13:07:50,wallstreetbets,Did they pay you well to post this?
2021-04-27 13:40:04,wallstreetbets,"For me, when I invest in a company, I want to see one of two things... Good financial stewardship with good leadership... or good public sentiment/momentum. I dont see either with RIDE or WRHS honestly. They have a lot of clean-up work to do, to clear up their tainted image. Best to let the shorts have at it on this one."
2021-04-27 13:08:56,wallstreetbets,I’m in ride
2021-04-27 17:50:12,wallstreetbets,"As a PSA I will post a bear thesis...

1. The San Felipe 250 was a disaster - (a) They only completed 40 out of 250 miles, (b) those 40 miles they averaged about 20 miles per hour. Race leaders average over the course 50 miles per hour, and (c) their battery efficiency was way less then they projected. Some people wonder why they had an inexperienced driver from the company drive the truck. Well not hard to imagine that no serious driver after giving it a test run would have agreed to drive it and destroy the reputation. Further, the company did not want a driver who would tell the media the car is crap and the in-wheel design just does not work.... Basically, if they needed off-road data this was a pointless and idiotic way to go about getting it. Also, the vehicle was a heavily modified vehicle so not sure what relevance it has to anything they would produce.
2. Leadership is incompetent... see point 1 above. You don't prove the off-road capabilities of a new vehicle in a public way like the San Felipe 250 without having tested the vehicle sufficiently to begin with. It was a gamble that failed which is bad leadership.
3. Regarding the San Felipe 250, the handling of the vehicle shows you some major flaws of unsprung weight. (a) efficiency is killed because the force of the tire hitting bumps is much greater due to the greater unsprung weight. In other words a motor mounted above the suspension with half-shafts driving the wheels should be more efficient. (b) While in terms of ability to climb or turn the in-wheel motor might be great, in terms of handling otherwise it is terrible. You now have significantly more force from the wheel being transferred upwards into the suspension one every bump causing the car to bounce much more. To compensate you would need a far more robust suspension and even that is unlikely to be sufficient.
4. Their target timeline for production later this year is likely way too aggressive. Given the failures of their beta or whatever vehicles, the chance of seeing a production version anytime soon seems remote.
5. Leadership, overstated the nature of the pre-orders, which while in itself does not concern me, it does show you have to take all their claims with a grain of salt.
6. Their cost targets for the vehicles seems unrealistic when you consider what everyone is dealing with in making EV's. The claim that in-wheel motors cuts down build costs is not so obvious to me, especially if you need to build the most amazing suspension ever to compensate for the unsprung weight.

In short, they have yet to demonstrate a proper vehicle and it is highly questionable whether they will every successfully manufacture a vehicle.

Right now I have no positions (actually I have 3 puts which are worth about $75 in total, so effectively no positions). I have no plan to buy puts due to timing issues and false optimism by investors I don't know how to time their eventually decline in value and make money on it."

2021-04-27 17:17:34,wallstreetbets,I have. Bear credit spreads and naked calls on RIDE with proper risk management are the closest thing to free money in the market right now
2021-04-27 14:44:38,wallstreetbets,"Imo puts aren't a good idea either. Ride has been beaten down bad enough, it probably just chops around for a while eating theta."

However, there are too many people that have been suckered and either ""believe"" or have lost so much they can't sell that puts don't make much sense.

If it spiked in the last 24 hours (it almost always has if it already made it to reddit), I don't buy but think about buying in after a drop. Already made that mistake with GME but was able to make profit. Still looking to buy back into GME but not doing the same 100% yolo move at the top of a rollercoaster."

2021-04-27 13:01:18,wallstreetbets,If you have an account <$25k that’s a good way to buy high and sell low when it triggers during a stop hunt. You can’t just buy back in w/o a day trade tally.
2021-04-27 15:38:46,wallstreetbets,What’s a stop loss?
2021-04-27 14:50:00,wallstreetbets,Nope .. it's too easy
2021-04-27 12:47:18,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-27 13:00:03,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-27 14:58:21,wallstreetbets,"It is, nobody should be selling at anything under 25. All this paperhanding is ridiculous. Folks want to hang in for a 5000%+ ride but it slips by 25% and everyone losses their fucking minds."
2021-04-27 17:24:24,wallstreetbets,I bought more too. Some of these people are scared children smh
2021-04-27 16:33:44,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, the reasons for it going up haven't changed."

2021-04-27 15:07:31,wallstreetbets,We panicked. I panicked. Luckily that day trading limit stopped me from joining the others who took the loss without researching the company.
2021-04-27 13:17:12,wallstreetbets,Those 20% 15 dollar puts are going to be real pissed.
2021-04-27 19:59:29,wallstreetbets,god willing
2021-04-27 14:34:59,wallstreetbets,Then you didn’t buy before the hype

2021-04-27 13:00:03,wallstreetbets,"Are you handcuffed to the losses by day trading limits? I am. So, all I can do is watch. I doubled down again, like a fool, so I can lose more. lol"
2021-04-27 14:12:01,wallstreetbets,I'm holding
2021-04-27 12:49:42,wallstreetbets,Yep
2021-04-27 15:11:06,wallstreetbets,Based upon research I'm believing the hype. This is beyond WSB to be honest. If I believed in conspiracy theories I think the mainstream/people screaming sell are looking to move the stocks into other people's hands.
2021-04-27 15:12:47,wallstreetbets,"By selling a stock that has huge potential by Friday based upon legit datasources, and not mainstream media screaming 'sell' and trying to capitalize on WSB trending/sensationalism?

Research the company and what's happening. I firmly believe now people who didn't get in now are the ones that will be, ""Damn, I missed the boat twice on this."""
2021-04-27 15:14:15,wallstreetbets,"There's legit data points that suggests that MVIS has massive upcoming potential. Not sure how WSB got involved or who brought it here, but there's multiple data points that suggests this has huge upside and potential still."
2021-04-27 13:40:16,wallstreetbets,Was holding for 30. Gonna keep it anyway.
2021-04-27 15:58:20,wallstreetbets,"The 3 day rule is absolute. A stock might go up and down after 1 or 2 days, but if a stock goes up big 3 days in a row? GTFO it's going down.

Wanna know how many days GME went up before shit went down? 3.

The 2nd time GME went up, this time without hedge fund and broker fuckery? 3 days before it went down.

It's gone up 2 days in a row now just wait ti tomorrow GME gonna go up one more time before it goes red on Thursday.

3 days of big green days means something is afoot. In the case of GME and MVIS its that many of the short sellers had to back out because they were losing bigly and after 3 days most of them have probably exited. Now obviously there will be new short sellers to take their place, except these ones make money cuz they short at the top and not near the bottom like literal retards that had to back out and make the stock skyrocket."
2021-04-27 16:27:42,wallstreetbets,"Lol, trading apps need to ask your trading skills and if you select (rookie, apprentice, new or anything like that) you must get that kind of pop up before you click  buy for a second chance."
2021-04-27 15:06:49,wallstreetbets,Happened to me with GME back with that massive dip and immediate recovery one day. Had a stop loss of $170 thinking “no way it’ll actually go that low”
2021-04-27 16:33:16,wallstreetbets,Sell order that triggers if a stock price drops to or below a certain amount.
2021-04-27 12:48:22,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-27 12:48:23,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-27 13:12:43,wallstreetbets,this must be the way
2021-04-27 16:19:18,wallstreetbets,"Tell me about it. One day of it dipping, even when the market itself just flat out sucked. What happened to diamond hands. What happened to believing in the stonk. This shit has potential! Even if it's not by Thursday (but it might) it will go back up!"
2021-04-27 19:55:08,wallstreetbets,"Slips by 25% Jesus I’m not sure if you’re being sarcastic or not lol

Edit looking at that chart it’s bullish as fuck.  Broke its all time high and is bull flagging. I think that rips"
2021-04-27 16:14:25,wallstreetbets,Haha well said ! I totally agree
2021-04-27 17:36:45,wallstreetbets,Good move and indeed! Now they will all pile back in when it’s up tomorrow haha. Go $mvis

2021-04-27 14:41:51,wallstreetbets,Sounds like they bought in February 2000 when it was at $500 a share

2021-04-27 13:50:50,wallstreetbets,Seems there’s to much steam now she’ll be back up even it’s a few months.

2021-04-27 16:44:51,wallstreetbets,">Wanna know how many days GME went up before shit went down? 

you're a dumbass. GME went up for about 2 weeks before shit went down, not 3."

2021-04-27 18:50:07,wallstreetbets,It was all naked shorts today.
2021-04-27 16:50:21,wallstreetbets,"But seriously, this"
2021-04-27 19:09:06,wallstreetbets,It was sarcasm bro.🤣
2021-04-27 12:55:16,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-27 13:22:52,wallstreetbets,Is this the way?
2021-04-27 13:10:38,wallstreetbets,BUY HIGH SELL LOW
2021-04-27 15:09:10,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, after I researched I don't think us being locked in ended up being a bad thing other than inhibiting us from buying the dip. To be honest, if I was able to sell before the big dip I may not have came back and looked into MicroVision and why there's real hype. We maybe the lucky ones here."
2021-04-27 18:37:07,wallstreetbets,"Same I wanted to sell at 28 today, saw the warning and said fuck it 40% profit gone. Oh well about at my average."
2021-04-27 14:14:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm thinking the same, at least wait till the end of the week"
2021-04-27 13:06:01,wallstreetbets,what?
2021-04-27 13:17:38,wallstreetbets,If I were dfv I’d also cut communication and quietly sell all my shares to be $30 million richer.
2021-04-27 18:37:13,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, WSB has always been about yoloing all your money on short term stocks and losing it. It was never about long term holds, there is no excitement in that. 

GME is still very much in play. But WSB isn’t going to let it take over their entire subreddit, they want to get back to losing money on their yolos. 

Still holding my 7 shares of GME @120. I’m not a bag holder, I could sell now for profit. But honestly believe the DD points to this thing launching as soon as the big players are ready."
2021-04-27 12:56:38,wallstreetbets,The whole thing's fishy. I feel bad for a lot of people
2021-04-27 18:39:45,wallstreetbets,This statement doesn't make sense. I can sell half with 100% return and let the rest ride.
2021-04-27 13:51:16,wallstreetbets,I'm not even down 300 yet.
2021-04-27 19:21:59,wallstreetbets,"Palpatine, dooku, and Anakin... Obviously something is afoot and one is going down. It's a... complimentary rule, you might say."
2021-04-27 17:17:28,wallstreetbets,"It didn't go up every single day. It went up once and went flat. Then it went up again and went flat. Calling me a dumbass when you don't understand shit of what I said doesn't make you smart. it makes you a dumbass.

3 days in a row. There you go. Your tiny ape brain can understand what is obviously implied. GME went up since what, December? It went up and rated flat though for days to weeks between. Once it mooned it was 3 days. Dumbass"
2021-04-27 16:17:49,wallstreetbets,"Reason 3 day rule works is because market is a lot of psychology. If a hedge fund sees their position being rocketed by hype and shorts exiting they're gonna find the time to take their profit. 3 days is a trend. Day 3 we saw more people entering than day 1 and 2 combined. To a hedge fund that sees most shorts exited it's now time to sell into the hype of retail.

Stock goes up 1 day? It has your attention.

Goes up again? Now its gaining traction and you might go in - or might not.

Goes up a 3rd time? ""Holy shit I gotta get in on this it's going to the moon!""

That's why it's 3 days. Always follow this shit.

Keep in mind this has no bearing on long term it's only for short term play. Every stock chart ever has up and down even as it trends upward over time. The 3 day rule can save you a lot of pain on the timing though. It's better to buy at 20 than 27 after all, even if the stock is going to be above 27 one day."
2021-04-27 19:02:25,wallstreetbets,"You using that phrase shows that you have no idea what you're talking about.

While I'm sure people shorted today, there were plenty of shares to short after 3 days of huge exit points. You see those massive gap-ups that happen in an instant midday? That's most likely a short exiting or partially exiting. Massive gap downs are the same thing but a short opening a position instead of closing. A hedge fund causes a slow, steady downtrend. This morning it was shorted then a slow selloff happened all day long.

Naked short selling isnt really a thing because there is no need too. It requires multiple large groups who have a lot to lose to dobe a part of it. Why naked short illegally when you can just short a share thats already been shorted?

Nobody knows of the shares you bought was already shorted. The same share can be shorted endlessly so long as it's available to borrow. That's how you see short percent over 100. It's the same legal shares shorted more then once. Nothing illegal about it and achieves the same thing - shorting a stock that has an apparently low borrowing availability."
2021-04-27 13:04:39,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-27 13:25:09,wallstreetbets,Yes this is the way
2021-04-27 14:17:50,wallstreetbets,Exactly
2021-04-27 13:19:11,wallstreetbets,I mean he’s got legal reasons too... I feel like these guys sold out and I kinda feel betrayed... still like the sub but stings a little.
2021-04-27 14:25:19,wallstreetbets,Lmao this trash sub is fishy yes
2021-04-27 18:42:13,wallstreetbets,I got in at 28.74 I was talking in regards to myself
2021-04-27 14:38:54,wallstreetbets,I'm down $3 :(
2021-04-27 16:19:38,wallstreetbets,Thank you this advice is gold.
2021-04-27 18:56:29,wallstreetbets,I was about to comment about how HD didn't care about that rule but then I looked at the chart again. Every fourth day(after 3 big green days) it pretty much stayed flat. There was still a bit of uptrend but it shows the psychology of the 3 green days could have been a factor. In all honesty I tend do dump after 3 big days but I never even thought about it being a common thing until your comment.
2021-04-27 19:39:29,wallstreetbets,"most brokers have been showing next to nothing for availability all week. double digits. yesterday as well i believe. 90% utilization. so im not sure a lot of people exited. even this morning, maybe those who jumped in monday and were afraid of bags. MMs making the books look flat perhaps willing to let those get naked.  
just a hunch. obviously didnt put too much effort into the comment.

i agree, no one really knows. why would anyone do anything illegal, especially in the stock market lol? only those shorting it do."

2021-04-27 15:47:14,wallstreetbets,"From stocknews.com - 

Due to higher crop prices and strong farmer demand for crop inputs, the price of fertilizer is expected to increase. Plus, potash prices should increase over the long term as demand rebounds from last year. There will also be an increased demand for potash in China and India as these two countries are looking to increase the food supply. Phosphate prices should continue to rise off tightening supply and robust demand in Brazil and India.

MOS has an overall grade of B, which translates into a Buy rating in our POWR Ratings service. The company has a Growth Grade of A as revenue is expected to rise 23.8% year over year in the most recent quarter. Earnings are expected to soar 916.7% year over year in the same quarter and another 700% in the next quarter.

The company also has a Value Grade of B, which isn’t surprising, with a trailing P/E of 17.86 and a low forward P/E of only 11.79"

2021-04-27 15:41:39,wallstreetbets,I'm sick I just closed $33 call for jun 18 yesterday. I figured it would hit its high then pull back. But I'm guessing earnings are going to be good. Might have to get back in
2021-04-27 13:39:50,wallstreetbets,How high do you expect it to go and by when?
2021-04-27 16:59:56,wallstreetbets,They make phosphorous for fertilizer that farmers use.  Grain prices are very high right now so the expectation is that farmers will use their profits this fall to put on a lot of fertilizer for next years crop.  Full disclosure: I sell mosaic fertilizer to farmers.

The big guns have the capital to buy time, so that’s why there so far stretched out (less risky). But if you can afford it, always best to do a minimum of 2-3weeks out on your calls. Protects you from decay. The longer out the better"
2021-04-27 13:29:22,wallstreetbets,"Tbh no one pays attention to price targets these days. You present a reasonable argument, but I’m following dark pool plays. Aka the guys that place the price targets are the ones making the plays. I bet come Monday there will be a new price target"

2021-04-27 16:55:59,wallstreetbets,"Nah I’m just saying you have to be retarded to buy 150 of the same contract that’s traded at low volumes. The volume on the calls he’s holding was 22 today... He’s going to crush himself regardless on CRSR because the volume is so low, very hard to sell 150 of the same call. On top of that he could of cut his losses, gone for the $30 and $35 calls and be up 100% from two weeks ago. You should never mind fuck yourself into holding a specific call. Should be checking IV levels daily and look to switch into lower IV calls around the same strike that you believe in. You should never pay more than $50 on a call that’s far OTM. Because you will get crushed. I made a fucking killing on selling naked calls on MVIS yesterday and covered myself today"

That advice has Nothing to do with helping my current position ;)"
2021-04-27 17:09:20,wallstreetbets,His calls expire in December. Theta is his friend as he has almost 7 months left. If CRSR goes to $50’s within the next couple of months he will regain the loss
2021-04-27 17:39:00,wallstreetbets,Yes but the streaming industry hit a bubble. I like CRSR as a company but it’s going to be tough for them to hit 10-20% beats in the next 2 quarters while maintaining EPS. Again I like the company but his theta will decay pretty hard as the stock won’t move outside of earnings. Less about the call and more about this guy refusing to shave his calls. Why hold 150 calls on a strike that trades lower volume than the amount you hold

2021-04-27 11:49:13,wallstreetbets,Bro.... please tell me this is photoshopped. This company IPO at $4 a share and is obviously price manipulation. Be prepared to get wrecked when they announce share offerings and have a good stop loss set.
2021-04-27 14:39:07,wallstreetbets,"I got in initially and cashed out with some gains, but then FOMO’ed when it really mooned. 

I see a lot of businesses in the news adopting them for their financing, so I think the stock will ultimately do well. I might get back in if it drops to about $70-80"
2021-04-27 11:51:32,wallstreetbets,Congratulations
2021-04-27 13:31:56,wallstreetbets,Been following Upstart for the last month or so. What makes this company interesting is the fact that people can apply for financing over the computer and they developed proprietary software for it. I am in the car business and I can see this technology replacing certain aspects of my job. I plan on jumping in if the market corrects and it goes below $100. I wanted to buy in at $80 but it took off too quickly.

2021-04-27 17:06:25,wallstreetbets,Thank you
2021-04-27 12:38:14,wallstreetbets,$20-50 imo
2021-04-27 13:01:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the company is Canadian and it's called Mydecine Innovations. It's an OTC stock or whatever that means (I like the purple crayons best).

Its ticker I think is MYCO.co or something like that but if you look up the company name you can find it pretty easy.

Two things I look for is do they have a product. And do they have a team and will the government actually let them do what they are trying to do. Which is create a novel compound or series of compounds based off of tradition psychedelics that can be used by professionals. The answer to all of those questions at least to this dummies eyes are yes.

They have significant challenges and a lot of work yet still to do so I think that's pretty well reflected in the current share price. However if this company does grow as the industry becomes way more legitimate over the next couple years they are in a great spot. I found it when I was researching MindMed. 

Not financial advice, I just like the stock. Eat your own crayons."
2021-04-27 13:07:57,wallstreetbets,"The washable crayons taste like soap, imo.


maybe someone who knows more can tell me, what is the diff between MYCOF, MYCO.NE, and 0NFA.F   ???"
2021-04-27 15:05:26,wallstreetbets,I wish I could shed more light on that for you. Because it's basically a penny stock they are listed on a few different boards than your regular exchange. If their market cap increases and other things grow they could apply to be listed on a bigger exchange like the TSX. I have a broker so I let him figure which ticker to buy and how to reconcile my purchase. Let him put that fancy college degree to work. I was too busy sniffing glue in my twenties for school.

2021-04-27 13:05:02,wallstreetbets,"I worked as a 3rd party Customer Service Rep for Ally.  6 weeks of classroom training before ever getting on the phone.  This also included taking tests.  Had to pass 90%.  You get 2 chances to pass each test, or you are out.  

Even though we were 3rd party, Ally treated us a equals.  From the inside, I can tell you they are a quality organization.  The 3rd party I worked for did call centers for multiple companies.  Ally reps were the highest-paid.

Several things to note about Ally:  Their accounts are interest bearing.  No minimum to open an account.  Also there was no time limit when it came to Customer Service Calls.  As a Rep, you are evaluated on quality of  each call, not on length.  They want you to solve the Customer's problem in a single call if possible, no matter how long it takes."

Not going to tell you what to do now, though.  You can hold and hope it starts working back up until Thursday, or you can cut your losses and run.  

But the big takeaway is that the gains this stock saw over the last few days are almost assuredly unsustainable.  Meaning hardly any stock continues at that pace day after day."

2021-04-27 16:12:09,wallstreetbets,Ya I held because of all the Thursday stuff. I woke up to 24 and thought it was just dipping with the rest of the market. I was wrong I atleast managed to sell at 22 and buy backnin at 20 to mitigate some of the loss. If it doesn't recover I'm just gonna cash out what's left and exit. Maybe try again in a few months if it gets less ticker spammy here. I used to be able to watch the threads here and jump in on fast climbing tickers but by the time I see stuff through all the screeching now it's too late.
2021-04-27 15:48:12,wallstreetbets,They ended up like MVIS
2021-04-27 17:26:03,wallstreetbets,What makes you think im holding?

2021-04-27 12:20:41,wallstreetbets,erm.....it's an allusion to Julius Caesar speaking to Brutus. It's not french.
2021-04-27 12:40:07,wallstreetbets,It’s from Shakespeare.
2021-04-27 19:11:59,wallstreetbets,No sell no loss
2021-04-27 14:10:50,wallstreetbets,"That’s the plan, brother. I could’ve saved a couple hundred, but I didn’t wanna get up early today and I didn’t want it to pop way up before I did wake."
2021-04-27 14:31:30,wallstreetbets,"Famous last words.

God speed tho"
2021-04-27 15:20:57,wallstreetbets,If it makes you feel better I picked up 30c 5/31...at 6.0. I excelled at grabbing them a millisecond before the first plunge this morning
2021-04-27 14:43:51,wallstreetbets,"Same here except 27.60... We're in this together bud!
I'm honestly thinking of doubling down and buying a bunch more tho ngl... Yolo"
2021-04-27 12:35:57,wallstreetbets,Consider averaging down but you said all in. Damn
2021-04-27 12:59:05,wallstreetbets,How many shares? 😥
2021-04-27 13:05:34,wallstreetbets,"Hold on, help is on the way. This is just a dip, the Hype is for Thursday."
2021-04-27 13:42:52,wallstreetbets,You will be okay. The PR on Thursday AH will erase all these losses. Mvis longs have been waiting for this PR since December so it’s a big deal
2021-04-27 16:08:48,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service
2021-04-27 16:27:24,wallstreetbets,You’re not the only one
2021-04-27 13:41:30,wallstreetbets,The rumor is Microsoft is the front runner to buyout MVIS. They’re literally down the street from each other and it’s well know one of MVIS verticals powers the imaging in hololens 2
2021-04-27 13:25:47,wallstreetbets,"LOL, this should be the answer"
2021-04-27 18:33:42,wallstreetbets,You the real mvp for that
2021-04-27 13:06:32,wallstreetbets,I meant the fisher dudes... are they ok???
2021-04-27 12:14:52,wallstreetbets,whats your position?
2021-04-27 17:55:24,wallstreetbets,🤦🏻‍♀️
2021-04-27 16:16:11,wallstreetbets,Here here!!
2021-04-27 17:28:22,wallstreetbets,Somebody get this guy a bagholder flair stat
2021-04-27 17:25:55,wallstreetbets,"Nah, he understands how every stock on social media goes."
2021-04-27 16:37:49,wallstreetbets,The market doesn't give a shit how you feel.
2021-04-27 17:16:15,wallstreetbets,"You just have to not be completely stupid. For example, Clov was based on nothing. Mvis had pages of DD and was at a but point on it's daily chart. Easy buy last week."
2021-04-27 15:31:48,wallstreetbets,"Lol, thank you ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)"
2021-04-27 14:42:46,wallstreetbets,Wtf you didnt lose. Git outta here
2021-04-27 17:24:32,wallstreetbets,"LMAO

This stock will go much lower before its delisting"
2021-04-27 13:45:03,wallstreetbets,I swear too many people bought MVIS without doing an DD. The big day is Thursday for the PR for an update on the automotive LiDAR module. The Thursday meeting is the literal reason the company has been running up for the last several months. It would be silly to sell before hearing about the demo they did this month
2021-04-27 16:45:00,wallstreetbets,"True enough. It's not all that much though. I'm broke as shit rn and mostly I think I'm just breaking even when all the losses and gains are accounted for. But I'm taking those profits and reinvesting them in various other stonks this reddit discusses.

Also sold all my AMC at a profit, waiting for its inevitable dip."
2021-04-27 17:18:31,wallstreetbets,Completely fine?
2021-04-27 17:39:17,wallstreetbets,buyout lol
2021-04-27 12:41:37,wallstreetbets,Surprise surprise. The shit slinging apes are cultured
2021-04-27 14:07:14,wallstreetbets,"> erm.....it's an allusion to Julius Caesar speaking to Brutus. It's not french.

And OP still fucked up the vocative case.

^^^This ^^^is ^^^not ^^^financial ^^^advice ^^^and ^^^I ^^^am ^^^not ^^^a ^^^professional, ^^^everyone ^^^here ^^^is ^^^an ^^^actual ^^^retard."
2021-04-27 12:41:12,wallstreetbets,Well then. WSB is more learned than expected
2021-04-27 13:34:57,wallstreetbets,"No, it’s from Twilight"
2021-04-27 14:40:25,wallstreetbets,If you’re a short term trader then yeah it looks risky. For me? Im staying for the buyout and these fluctuations don’t bother me
2021-04-27 14:57:56,wallstreetbets,I sold some of my CLOV for MVIS when it dropped to 22. Fuck eit.  🚀
2021-04-27 16:43:28,wallstreetbets,"New support is at 19.35, that used to be the old resistance.  This will come back for you."
2021-04-27 14:25:19,wallstreetbets,I think this time you will be fine
2021-04-27 14:34:51,wallstreetbets,"I am poorboi relative to most of you guys so only 152. My wage just recently went up to $14.50, it was $11.50 back in March. I'm actually decent at saving money but then I got a hernia & RIP savings."
2021-04-27 14:55:06,wallstreetbets,What time Thursday are we expecting the release?
2021-04-27 13:46:50,wallstreetbets,So hold?
2021-04-27 17:05:30,wallstreetbets,"On the other hand, there's a lot of former Ford and Google employees on the Board of Directors for MVIS right now. 

I believe, and have always believed there is a bidding war between Google and Microsoft going on. I believe the interest was high all this year, but the make or break was this month when they have the A-Sample demo. 

Assuming the closed demo has already gone on, I bet the two are fighting pretty hard to see who gets it. 

The other option is strategic partnerships with both. Microsoft getting the Augmented Reality portion of things, and Google getting the Autonomous Driving portion."
2021-04-27 16:34:47,wallstreetbets,Why would they buy at 4 billion dollar valuation when they could have bought it for 20 million at any point in the last ten years?
2021-04-27 13:45:11,wallstreetbets,"Ya, in the longer version of this video, the friend driving the boat reverses and turns, and then starts laughing his ass off at his friend."
2021-04-27 15:08:05,wallstreetbets,457 shares atm. Small fries to some but a bunch to me.
2021-04-27 15:28:32,wallstreetbets,Bent over lubed up
2021-04-27 17:41:13,wallstreetbets,No it happens fast. You have to get on right away. You are welcome btw. Nobody that was pushing real money would be talking this way
2021-04-27 16:38:31,wallstreetbets,You idiots bought in today didn’t you 😂😂
2021-04-27 17:31:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah good dd + a good chart makes this a lot easier than people are making it.  Well also some decisiveness, if you waffle for 2 days you're gonna miss out."
2021-04-27 15:28:50,wallstreetbets,Srry i meant 830 @ 22. 700 @ 5 is my MNMD. Also in the Red lol.
2021-04-27 16:27:54,wallstreetbets,Doesn't MVIS have a board meeting or something as well in May that could be big
2021-04-27 13:49:51,wallstreetbets,What if their demo went badly 🥵🥵🥵🥵
2021-04-27 14:10:38,wallstreetbets,"declension is now the fancy word for clenching your ass when the shorts attack!!!

edit: or maybe relaxing it afterwards"
2021-04-27 17:42:36,wallstreetbets,"I'm currently invested in a company that announced they were being sold 18 months ago. They issued an RNS in January saying they are still fielding non-binding offers. It's been crickets since then. 

Be prepared to wait a while is all I'm saying. These things take a long ass time, if they ever actually come to fruition."
2021-04-27 16:09:32,wallstreetbets,"Out of curiosity, have you ever went to Google and typed in MVIS Buyout?  On Reddit alone, there are search results all the way back to 2018 talking about MVIS buyout being ""soon"" with a whole host of potential suitor companies.  

I'm not sure what your definition of short / long is, but this could be a LONG way away."
2021-04-27 14:42:27,wallstreetbets,"Lmao...push those goalposts! So Thursday is a crapshoot, the real deal is the ""buyout"" which may or may not be worth $28.

EDIT: if Thursday is a bust, you are all going to look so silly. Thank God for your imaginary buyout goalpost."
2021-04-27 15:12:51,wallstreetbets,"Congrats on the increase, that's a big jump"
2021-04-27 17:32:49,wallstreetbets,Thursday at Market close the Q1 earnings report will be released. There will be a link on MicroVision's website if you want to listen in.
2021-04-27 13:50:14,wallstreetbets,"Yessir hold until MINIMUM after the Thursday call. New WSBers experienced how crazy MVIS can be on no news. You guys have yet to see how insane it gets WITH PR.

For example in Feb, the ceo simply said “our LiDAR module is on schedule” and the stock blew up from 14 to 24 in after hours alone. That was without WSB or even any real news. This Thursday the ceo should cover that LiDAR module and how the demo went with private customers. It would be FOOLISH to not hold until then"
2021-04-27 19:06:46,wallstreetbets,"Bruh just look at u/s2upid ‘s history and be amazed. He tore apart the MSFT Hololens 2, 344 days ago... filled with MVIS tech"
2021-04-27 17:03:15,wallstreetbets,"Either side is not an idiot. 

They don’t care about what the market cap is to determine how much their company is worth or could be worth."
2021-04-27 16:59:02,wallstreetbets,"Human psychology.

Or maybe the company has been asking 4 bil the whole time, and nobody has been willing to buy"
2021-04-27 13:46:44,wallstreetbets,Lol thank goodness
2021-04-27 15:49:50,wallstreetbets,Sell them overpriced calls my guy
2021-04-27 18:13:55,wallstreetbets,What? You wrote a bunch of nonsense that probably makes more sense to you.
2021-04-27 17:13:12,wallstreetbets,"I took my profits on Friday, like everyone else that was paying attention."
2021-04-27 15:44:09,wallstreetbets,Oh rip. Best of luck homie.
2021-04-27 13:53:08,wallstreetbets,"That’s a possibility for sure. Nothing is guaranteed in this world.

However, the newest MVIS CEO is very legit and speaks with high confidence. If the demo was delayed or went poorly, i highly doubt they would’ve moved their Q1 press conference from May into April"
2021-04-27 19:33:13,wallstreetbets,And that was for a company that actually announced it. It is and always has been just rumors for MVIS.
2021-04-27 18:29:00,wallstreetbets,"The tech was too far ahead of it's time. AR and automotive LIDAR are finally in high demand. MVIS is now all n the drivers seat. I actually wonder if the A sample is just proof of concept and the deal is made, just waiting for the A sample to be verified. Everyone is coming out with self driving cars and AR soon. Do some DD Apple is working on both so are many others."
2021-04-27 16:12:08,wallstreetbets,"You’re not wrong at all. Buyouts aren’t that common and take a long time to hammer out all the details. Buyout rumors are the long long game (for me personally) with no timeline and that’s not something that reels in the general WSB crowd 

However, i do truly believe this Thursday catalyst is going to be huge and i know that’s something WSBers can get behind"
2021-04-27 14:50:12,wallstreetbets,"I’m not moving goal posts, I’m explaining my long position. 90% of people on WSB don’t read DD anyway so it’s easier to advertise the Thursday catalyst"
2021-04-27 17:14:39,wallstreetbets,It dropped 24% today...for what reason?
2021-04-27 15:49:56,wallstreetbets,"""To the moon!"""
2021-04-27 19:16:00,wallstreetbets,Thanks player ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
2021-04-27 13:53:26,wallstreetbets,Awesome will do. Is there a live event or something at some time? I actually have calls from last week that I am continuing to hold
2021-04-27 17:11:25,wallstreetbets,How do you think one publicly traded company buys another?
2021-04-27 17:25:41,wallstreetbets,"The word Neither exists solely so that you do not have to write ""either is not"" please don't make poor neither unemployed. 🙁"
2021-04-27 16:22:00,wallstreetbets,"Well... Sadly. That's not all that happened in the video. The other friend got such a kick out of the joke, he started jumping up and down yelling ""WOOO WOOO WOO!"" Despite his friends pleas to stop jumping, the boat tipped over and they died. Tragic."
2021-04-27 15:15:08,wallstreetbets,"And that’s what we want mvis to do, so we can laugh our ass off of those who sold"
2021-04-27 17:15:04,wallstreetbets,Also if you took your profits then it was a win you negative Nancy
2021-04-27 17:14:42,wallstreetbets,Dude it went up 60 percent yesterday and no you aren’t suoosed to sell till after 40. Sick of guys like you that sell out before the real tendies. Probabaky didn’t matter though. Probably had like 10 shares lol
2021-04-27 15:56:51,wallstreetbets,Preciate it bro. Soon as Thursday comes and i see even a fraction of a profit im pulling outta this hoe
2021-04-27 14:15:20,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, no reason to move the conference forward with bad news"
2021-04-27 17:19:37,wallstreetbets,!remindme 48 hours
2021-04-27 19:08:37,wallstreetbets,What time is it gonna be?
2021-04-27 15:01:24,wallstreetbets,Made quite the big promise for Thursday tho. Guess we will see. Maybe will be an annual tradition of talking about buyouts. I remember last May when it was brought up.
2021-04-27 14:59:43,wallstreetbets,A real passionate lifetime follower of MVIS I see.  Definitely not a fair weather buyer who just jumped in last week when they first heard of the company and started spam reading DD's  XD
2021-04-27 18:09:22,wallstreetbets,Because of how much it went up yesterday. This happens all the time with WSB stocks.
2021-04-27 13:59:58,wallstreetbets,Yeah it’s a webcast that they have a link for on their website. 2PM pacific time on Thursday! Check it out for yourself and see why so many of us are still so optimistic
2021-04-27 17:15:40,wallstreetbets,MVIS proponents are high level retards. Literal stupid people propping up the stock. There's no institutional ownership of this stock all retail.
2021-04-27 17:13:09,wallstreetbets,You clearly missed my point
2021-04-27 17:27:48,wallstreetbets,We need more bots like this. Good reminder
2021-04-27 17:29:59,wallstreetbets,"“You aren’t supposed to sell till after 40”

JFC my guy..."
2021-04-27 17:29:53,wallstreetbets,Remember this post after the earnings report sends it back to $10 a share with a nice little slope back to $6 by the end of the year.

2021-04-27 16:11:58,wallstreetbets,"and the year before that .... and the year before that as well.

I don't think these people have researched this company enough.

MVIS / Buyout is like the stock market analogy of the ""Boy who cried Wolf""...."
2021-04-27 17:55:46,wallstreetbets,😰😰 how much longer you think?
2021-04-27 17:57:19,wallstreetbets,Happy cake day? I guess?

And look at the upvotes. Absolute morons are buying up this dudes bullshit. He literally just started investing in the stock a few weeks ago. He has been mentioning MVIS nonstop for so many days. Pumping as hard as he fucking can"

2021-04-27 11:21:38,wallstreetbets,Well I was able to buy. Lol
2021-04-27 12:12:03,wallstreetbets,I had a sell limit at $29.50 and it sold after hours yesterday. Woke up today and it's down to $22. Time to buy the dip
2021-04-27 12:49:51,wallstreetbets,Call options at open i love life
2021-04-27 13:22:10,wallstreetbets,The MVIS play is the potential buyout and demo and moving earnings up on 4/29.
2021-04-27 11:26:49,wallstreetbets,I bought on that last dip down and less than a week later it was up so have faith! Fun stock

2021-04-27 16:02:05,wallstreetbets,When will you retards learn? If you start to see multiple posts about how amazing everyone’s gains are it’s time to sell and get the fuck out lol
2021-04-27 12:34:38,wallstreetbets,I sold some of my MVIS investment to lock in some profits and put it into MNMD! Now if the investing God's could do me a favor and send both of those to the Moon I would be one happy biatch!
2021-04-27 16:56:14,wallstreetbets,"Yup, this is what MVIS does. If you can't handle sitting at the big boy table, then continue on. 

We'll be well past 30 soon. FOMO gonna strike down the sell outs again once we have another bull run. And fundamental catalysts are on the horizon"
2021-04-27 14:38:01,wallstreetbets,$MVIS BUY BUY BUY
2021-04-27 12:49:50,wallstreetbets,I bought more at 22$ it will go up again by thursday
2021-04-27 14:40:19,wallstreetbets,A 19% dip is 19% more reason to buy
2021-04-27 13:11:45,wallstreetbets,We need more power .. and diamond hands 💎🙌

2021-04-27 17:07:53,wallstreetbets,😅 first time around with MVIS?.. it's not even Thursday 🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-04-27 19:20:56,wallstreetbets,"Bought it at 10.49, sold it at 27.11"
2021-04-27 19:37:36,wallstreetbets,"What you crying about, its up 10x from December?"
2021-04-27 11:48:28,wallstreetbets,"Why would you buy a stock that's up 100% in less than a week and expect it to keep going up? I mean it happens sure but I feel like there are better bets.

sold my MVIS positions Fri and Mon."
2021-04-27 16:54:11,wallstreetbets,"Y’all preach diamond hands, but paper handed as FUCK in reality. Change the name of the sub to gmecirclejerk plz"
2021-04-27 15:03:45,wallstreetbets,"Short players squeezing the nerves out of everyone.  Mvis has good IP and getting big boys attention, not just corporates, but uncle SAM.  It will hit 45+ next week, when backers moving in."
2021-04-27 10:49:52,wallstreetbets,Should’ve sold at market open
2021-04-27 12:23:27,wallstreetbets,Dude that is a truly disturbing meme. I think you should have bought mnmd instead😁
2021-04-27 12:48:31,wallstreetbets,"I’m curious, what is the TLDR DD on MVIS? I’ve read about LIDAR, but that is competing against AI/camera making a map of the world in 3D and in real-time, which is cheaper and already gaining huge traction for EVs. Their short interest is relatively low. So what’s the play? How it goes from a penny stock to >$20."
2021-04-27 17:59:35,wallstreetbets,Sheeeet it ain’t over...MVIS still alive
2021-04-27 12:49:59,wallstreetbets,Where are the diamond hands?
2021-04-27 14:43:11,wallstreetbets,"I bet against MVIS hard and I'm loving it. Bought 100 shares at 25 bucks and change so I could sell a stupidly expensive call on it, then did a little put spread and bought myself an extra put to dump those 100 shares.

I love MVIS."
2021-04-27 17:23:42,wallstreetbets,It’s okay. It’s already recovering and will be making new highs before you know it
2021-04-27 18:05:05,wallstreetbets,"Doubled my money and got out in time, I’ll be back though"
2021-04-27 19:24:10,wallstreetbets,"Being down 20 points on a stock ain’t bad. 

If all your other stocks are down more."

2021-04-27 17:47:27,wallstreetbets,I sold quick asl once market opened. I still made 150 dollars so I'm happy lol
2021-04-27 18:13:39,wallstreetbets,"I got out at $27.50, was fully expecting the drop either today or tomorrow and it happened man, possibly a great entry point now, but she's a volatile little slut 😆"
2021-04-27 18:48:02,wallstreetbets,Glad I got in today! Up 5% AH
2021-04-27 18:53:34,wallstreetbets,"Bought 10 $MVIS for $10.94ea, when it hit $16, I put a 20% trailing stop on it. Peaked at $27.95, I believe, and sold @ $22.3685 when the floor was hit.  

First realized profit since started messing with stocks. Not much, but it's a nice double-up win."
2021-04-27 19:05:14,wallstreetbets,Just bought 10 more shares
2021-04-27 19:07:33,wallstreetbets,Happy I bought more GME instead of more MVIS

2021-04-27 12:33:53,wallstreetbets,"This thing is Dead flat on 22. For mor than 2h now... Considering of selling, as I went in at 14, do t really expect it to move up before thursday anyways"
2021-04-27 12:55:15,wallstreetbets,I bought the dip but it.. it.. it keeps dipping.
2021-04-27 13:07:54,wallstreetbets,I thought Thursday was the big day?
2021-04-27 13:16:15,wallstreetbets,"I didn't wake up early enough to sell, like a retard. This is the way."
2021-04-27 14:37:04,wallstreetbets,I sold for 80 cents a share last year.

2021-04-27 12:29:23,wallstreetbets,"Guess we all should have bailed out before yesterday close. Like a dummy, I sold this morning and than bought back in. If it weren't for bad luck, I'd have no luck at all."
2021-04-27 15:15:10,wallstreetbets,"I learned my lessons from GME/AMC/NOK/BB. Valuable lessons that I’m fucking stupid af and to never go chasing again lol. I’ve ended up making a good profit from GME, still have a lot invested, but I’m done chasing because of fomo"
2021-04-27 15:42:02,wallstreetbets,All the gains I made this month. Just poof. But I did it once I can do it again
2021-04-27 16:08:02,wallstreetbets,"Bought in last night and thought, this'll continue and I can sell tomorrow. Now it hurts to sit and I need ointment."
2021-04-27 18:17:36,wallstreetbets,Im only 3 months into my investing journey and I'm already wondering when are ppl going to learn not to buy a a stock when it's at its all time high 🧘
2021-04-27 18:49:06,wallstreetbets,Buy the stock!! 100 is not a meme
2021-04-27 19:34:03,wallstreetbets,"After a year in this group, I’ve learned once people start posting their big profits, selling time is within 24 hours"
2021-04-27 19:51:12,wallstreetbets,Had 1000 shares at a dollar.   Sold at $3.  Been hating myself since then.

2021-04-27 10:55:41,wallstreetbets,"If only everyone can get on the same page like we did with GME and AMC, but instead some idiots are still posting about GME and AMC."
2021-04-27 12:51:21,wallstreetbets,Where is that dude that said it was going to $50?
2021-04-27 12:54:57,wallstreetbets,We need to do it in a mass gathering. ... bet I mean.

2021-04-27 15:57:36,wallstreetbets,I'm sad.
2021-04-27 15:58:37,wallstreetbets,🤣
2021-04-27 15:59:55,wallstreetbets,"Nobody ever learns over here. After such a run-up it always falls down, except if the stock is called GME"
2021-04-27 16:00:25,wallstreetbets,What falls faster? A man or his shares?
2021-04-27 16:00:36,wallstreetbets,SHOULDA STAYED IN GME

2021-04-27 16:38:15,wallstreetbets,Buy the dips!
2021-04-27 16:38:59,wallstreetbets,"That sucks, man. I saw all the hype with people talking about it squeezing, so I grabbed a 5/21 $24c for $60. When I saw that shit fly yesterday I immediately sold for 783% profit. I felt some FOMO when I checked the price before market close, but now I'm relieved."

2021-04-27 16:41:08,wallstreetbets,I bought in at $10 and sold at 14.50. I missed the whole rid up..but I'm glad I took my profits because I'd probably still be holding right now lol
2021-04-27 16:43:34,wallstreetbets,Mvis somehow fell faster than this

2021-04-27 17:03:28,wallstreetbets,Good 👍
2021-04-27 17:04:34,wallstreetbets,Imagine not taking any profits on a 50% up day
2021-04-27 17:08:11,wallstreetbets,"I’m glad I closed half of my calls before I went to sleep and then bought shares at $22 with that money instead. I’m still up relative to my initial $290 investment. If I didn’t, waking up this morning to see it had dropped to $20 overnight would make me feel as lot worse."
2021-04-27 17:10:46,wallstreetbets,GUH!🤡
2021-04-27 17:11:57,wallstreetbets,You mean it didn’t make it back to that $300 all time high from the year 2000? 🤔 shocking...
2021-04-27 17:13:01,wallstreetbets,"Probably, there are better choices in the market than MVIS"
2021-04-27 17:16:31,wallstreetbets,How autistic do you need to be to buy MVIS
2021-04-27 17:19:13,wallstreetbets,Another shit for brains momentum player.
2021-04-27 17:20:41,wallstreetbets,remember when the bot would mark mvis with a warning?
2021-04-27 17:22:23,wallstreetbets,Bought 40 shares at $13 and 20 at the $10 dip thanks to the short sellers. Profited $550 yesterday thanks wsb
2021-04-27 17:26:11,wallstreetbets,MVIS

2021-04-27 17:31:03,wallstreetbets,"I mean....I bought it at like a dollar and sold at like $2 when first learning to invest. Had I kept it all this time, I'd be Rollin in it...."
2021-04-27 17:31:13,wallstreetbets,"Jokes on those guys who bought at market open, I bought at $11"
2021-04-27 17:31:57,wallstreetbets,Just another day in MVIS world
2021-04-27 17:34:30,wallstreetbets,As soon as MSM media began to mention this stock the fall was inevitable.
2021-04-27 17:37:45,wallstreetbets,That's why I sold my $35 call yesterday before close and sold my $20 put today before close.
2021-04-27 17:38:04,wallstreetbets,Try r/plugpowerstock we're only down 2%.
2021-04-27 17:38:28,wallstreetbets,This hurts man. Let's see where we are at tomorrow
2021-04-27 17:43:25,wallstreetbets,"Bought at 14, sold at 22, bought it back at 20….now have a limit sale on it for 22- hopefully it goes up before it goes down tomorrow too."
2021-04-27 17:43:45,wallstreetbets,What’s the thesis behind mvis???
2021-04-27 17:45:48,wallstreetbets,Were you the MVIS “Millionaire” from yesterday?
2021-04-27 17:52:27,wallstreetbets,"Bruh it went down because you bought...you have to sell so it go up. Then you buy, so it’ll go down. That’s when you sell again !"
2021-04-27 17:57:03,wallstreetbets,"No more money, no more Baddies for Omegle Kermit"
2021-04-27 18:08:59,wallstreetbets,I don't even know about MVIS and still I laughed
2021-04-27 18:09:24,wallstreetbets,😂😂🤣
2021-04-27 18:09:57,wallstreetbets,I knew as soon as they were already talking about MVIS it was already too late to get in on it. Took everything I had not to FOMO and invest in it. Glad I didn't.
2021-04-27 18:11:54,wallstreetbets,I hope that guy in the daily thread yesterday took my advice to not drop his 30k on a stock that was up like 140% in 5 days
2021-04-27 18:14:45,wallstreetbets,“Investment”
2021-04-27 18:17:52,wallstreetbets,Did you FOMO in after that guy posted yesterday about becoming a millionaire on MVIS?
2021-04-27 18:19:43,wallstreetbets,"lmao the tears in this thread, scared money dont make money."
2021-04-27 18:20:40,wallstreetbets,Dumb ass bought too late
2021-04-27 18:25:50,wallstreetbets,"Ehh double down, scratch that quadruple, no all in"
2021-04-27 18:33:47,wallstreetbets,F for those that bought at open/premarket.
2021-04-27 18:34:20,wallstreetbets,"For real, I feel like we’re gonna be watching these clips in real time soon... but will it be us or the elite?"
2021-04-27 18:34:40,wallstreetbets,In a day or 2 MNMD will probably do the same.
2021-04-27 18:39:48,wallstreetbets,Set a stop loss of $25 and walked away laughing.
2021-04-27 18:41:33,wallstreetbets,Bro I’m dying with this video 😂
2021-04-27 18:42:00,wallstreetbets,"of course someone makes a win on a stock, you buy it when its high and already won, so stupid, oh yes i am on the right sub"
2021-04-27 18:42:01,wallstreetbets,Watching MVIS now. Maybe after my ride With CELH and UPST I'll be able to make something out of MVIS.
2021-04-27 18:42:39,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell low.  This is the autist fk tard way ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)

2021-04-27 18:47:17,wallstreetbets,Why that happened? Did everyone go to GME instead of MVIS?
2021-04-27 18:52:57,wallstreetbets,"Bought at 15. If it dips below that, I’ll grab that discount. Must become one with the dip."
2021-04-27 18:53:10,wallstreetbets,You should have bought 50k shares at 1.50 like me. The 450 calls at were fun too.
2021-04-27 18:53:14,wallstreetbets,"In at $11, it’s all green for the long haul! Roll on Thursday ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)"

2021-04-27 19:35:41,wallstreetbets,Good.
2021-04-27 19:39:41,wallstreetbets,MVIS alteady hit the roof yesterday with 33% increase in value. A dip should be expected today just like GME. You shoyld have take a profit instead of being greedy.

2021-04-27 13:38:40,wallstreetbets,"Tomorrow we will all be doing well just be patient.🦍 hold strong , ape like to hold , ape love to hold *together*"
2021-04-27 16:30:49,wallstreetbets,"Hold the line! Buying another 10k! Remember that this money is not just to put a win in our hands but to hold, quite literally, the knife of judgement  that will slit the throats of those “ truly weak”. It is these ones who believe the evil that money is the answer,” that $ actually made them the strong, and that $ actually gave them the knife. Like a wildfire the so called “strong” have grown and thrived on this suffering and have spread their beliefs like a cancer. They have been guided by fear, molded by it and come to survive on the meager change spreading that fear could provide. Soon judgement will come and those took advantage of the many, and believed $ would fix all their problems and deliver them from their suffering will know a new pain. And When they eventually do come to the realization  of where they sit in on the food chain of the new worlds order. they will not only welcome death, but  crave the finality of its embrace, though to weak to lift their own knives to take it. When it is all done and their money is all gone and their many cities have long fallen. The weak will beg for death, & those truly strong will take judgement upon them, lending them the strength of our hand that will bring down the knife that will end their misery. And the meek will inherit nothing.


So remember. Hold the line Microvision! The rest are blasting it’s skyrockets. Here we go!"
2021-04-27 12:51:17,wallstreetbets,Haha

2021-04-27 15:07:46,wallstreetbets,I almost FOMOd too. Last week when that yolo was posted I said to myself “I’ll sell SPXL on Friday and get MVIS” before watching it catapult 4 days in a row.
2021-04-27 11:32:35,wallstreetbets,I bought puts at open 👻
2021-04-27 13:08:55,wallstreetbets,shall i buy at market open? what could possibly go wrong? stonks only go up!

2021-04-27 14:42:46,wallstreetbets,I sold and made $1500 in profit yesterday. Pocketed the rest and reinvested that $1500 back into it right when the market opened. Felt bad realizing I could have just waited an hour.
2021-04-27 11:39:25,wallstreetbets,"Me too. I knew as soon as I bought it would drop, and did it anyway."
2021-04-27 12:32:12,wallstreetbets,Same@27 and bought more on the way down.... avg at 25... am i doing it right?? Lol
2021-04-27 17:07:21,wallstreetbets,Ohhhhh fuck you retarded freak. Glad I don’t have the funds to day trade. These restrictions force me to hold GME even if there is another appealing spike. By the time I’d transfer I’d get fucked on the timing like you did.
2021-04-27 12:43:57,wallstreetbets,Yup same here too.  HOLD

2021-04-27 16:42:12,wallstreetbets,"Right there with you brother, bought at $27+ per share.... remember, if you never sell you never realize the loss 🧠🧠🧠 stay strong"
2021-04-27 16:52:09,wallstreetbets,"Almost yolo'd all my liquid at market open too, then I realized I didn't really need a piss."
2021-04-27 17:23:56,wallstreetbets,"Me too, then watched my account get napalmed. Rode that shit up the mountain all day yesterday only to jump off the cliff upon the arrival at the peak. Feel your pain."
2021-04-27 17:30:22,wallstreetbets,"Yea me too thinking all those who say go to moon went to hell instead, wtf is with you knuckleheads. Your platform has no real basis to follow. It’s one-two good swings and then your out on 3rd day. Time for pinch hitter in this crowd"
2021-04-27 17:36:31,wallstreetbets,"Not only you my brother,lose 4K today"
2021-04-27 17:41:09,wallstreetbets,can confirm - feels bad.
2021-04-27 18:24:31,wallstreetbets,"Same, but puts!"
2021-04-27 18:33:47,wallstreetbets,Good thing you waited for it to run up about 150% over a week and THEN buy. Warren Buffett Jr over here
2021-04-27 18:56:15,wallstreetbets,I sold at open. I guess I’m happy with it but I want to rebuy. So it need to tank for a while.
2021-04-27 19:24:51,wallstreetbets,Woke up late like a retard and only caught 50% tendies apposed to 75
2021-04-27 19:36:58,wallstreetbets,"Best comment ever, say no more!"
2021-04-27 19:52:45,wallstreetbets,My cousin likes doing this also.. hahaha did the same and missed all the peaks I'm like guy I love you but why you never listen.
2021-04-27 19:56:08,wallstreetbets,I did the same today. I knew better. Bought 100 shares at $26 a share hoping for a gain today to $35. I knew better myself I actually canceled the order one time but then put the order back in because I just knew that people were going to hold and the stock would continue to rise. However we got in late to the party and everyone sold and took their money. I don't blame them that is what they do you make profit you take profit why should you hold. As a result I sold at $19 and lost 800$ . I just shook my head all day. I don't have these diamond hands I think half of the ones that claim they do really don't be sure as you seen today it was  massive sell-off. And from what I read if the people would have really held they would have created a short squeeze play because the short betters would have to had buy these back making the price go up more. I guess they where happy with there few thousand when. And all reality they could have drove the price will over $100 in the coming weeks. I hear everyone say to the Moon most people sell at the ground. Lol just my observation. The good thing is another lesson learned as hard as it is not to buy at the opening it has taught me to not buy at the opening let the mad cash settle and wait and see what happens I have been a part of some really good money making deals and this one felt it has the potential but I should have pulled out once I noticed the immediate sell-off but then again I was hoping it was just some of the people who had had investments for a few years and then the other people would hold on to what they had and the stock would either level out and then slowly rise. Live and learn. Sometimes I think a lot of these things we read in these groups are written from the government to help bolster you to get you to spend your money. Wall Street is just like the casino sometimes you win 90% you're going to lose the house always wins and that's the way it is. Don't beat yourself up im down a few grand in the past few weeks after hitting for 12k on another stock. We can't win them all.
2021-04-27 18:24:16,wallstreetbets,I lost 8K 😥😥😥
2021-04-27 16:59:13,wallstreetbets,"Won't buy at $9 but panick buys at $25, brother?"
2021-04-27 10:55:54,wallstreetbets,I started yesterday MVIS was my first stock
2021-04-27 14:02:57,wallstreetbets,I want to take care of my mother and give her the life she’s always wanted so I’m doing as much research as I can to learn trading and exchange. I don’t know much about anything so I’m damn near out the womb when it comes to this stuff but I’m trying my hand. Let’s see where this goes
2021-04-27 17:38:43,wallstreetbets,This is why what GME did to this sub is dangerous. People with literally no idea what they are doing listening to random DD on reddit. Go back to buying lotto tickets and menthols.
2021-04-27 15:42:55,wallstreetbets,Hold it until I’m cold
2021-04-27 19:07:08,wallstreetbets,That’s all the DD I need to hear. I’m all in.
2021-04-27 18:34:23,wallstreetbets,still a good profit
2021-04-27 12:23:31,wallstreetbets,Almost every stock is crashing after earning reports because big players taking their profit when idiots buying more.

2021-04-27 12:51:46,wallstreetbets,What do you think it’ll drop to ( so I can grab more ) before the up swing ?
2021-04-27 11:34:36,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-04-27 17:01:19,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-04-27 12:59:11,wallstreetbets,"My options expire May 21, do you think I should have bought June or July?!"
2021-04-27 11:23:09,wallstreetbets,Which dip?
2021-04-27 10:55:34,wallstreetbets,Nice💪
2021-04-27 12:49:38,wallstreetbets,"""dip"""
2021-04-27 15:12:49,wallstreetbets,"Same, free stonks can ride though may sell if Thursday shows no promise."
2021-04-27 18:17:34,wallstreetbets,Same. God damned apes just wouldn’t let it drop below 19.
2021-04-27 13:13:09,wallstreetbets,Can I ask what brokerage you use that lets sell limits execute after hours? Fidelity doesn't allow that :(
2021-04-27 13:31:32,wallstreetbets,timed it perfectly!
2021-04-27 11:53:27,wallstreetbets,When is this buyout supposed to happen? I've been hearing somewhere around may
2021-04-27 13:55:42,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha fucking same!
2021-04-27 13:01:07,wallstreetbets,Why do you think it will be 60$ and when will that happen?! My options expire May 21st 🙁
2021-04-27 12:43:59,wallstreetbets,"Because Buy high Sell Low!
That's why"
2021-04-27 11:52:39,wallstreetbets,Cause nothing makes any fucking sense
2021-04-27 18:20:29,wallstreetbets,Fear Of Missing Out
2021-04-27 13:58:33,wallstreetbets,I think it’s time to take profits on MVIS and move on to the next big thing
2021-04-27 19:49:16,wallstreetbets,"GME was heavily shorted, and so were fucking the hedges by holding. No one is shorting this too the moon. This is an easy profit that people dumped as soon as it got really high."
2021-04-27 12:09:45,wallstreetbets,I sold half when it dipped to 25. Gave me my original investment plus a little extra back. So everything else I got is house money on MVIS
2021-04-27 10:51:30,wallstreetbets,I said the same and would have repurchased at lower price.
2021-04-27 10:55:25,wallstreetbets,"hold brotha, buy the dip and 🚀"
2021-04-27 13:12:55,wallstreetbets,Rumors of a buyout + demo + ER
2021-04-27 18:19:48,wallstreetbets,"Rumors and memes, nothing more"
2021-04-27 13:55:29,wallstreetbets,Right here bro...holding strong.  Cost basis is around $13 bucks and not selling.
2021-04-27 18:39:00,wallstreetbets,Same here man. If it gets down to the 10-12 range I’ll probably get back in.
2021-04-27 13:58:50,wallstreetbets,we have exactly the same shares and the same time frame lol hello fello bagholder
2021-04-27 17:51:11,wallstreetbets,Thursday is the big day but not till after market close
2021-04-27 19:04:45,wallstreetbets,because maybe go higher
2021-04-27 13:03:11,wallstreetbets,I've lost over $200 on a $1000 portfolio. I'm 18 so that's a lot for me ahaha \*nervous laughter\*

2021-04-27 11:25:59,wallstreetbets,"You’re gonna have to get on the same page with us, cause we’re not selling for mvis or any other"
2021-04-27 11:00:43,wallstreetbets,fr they really like to see how long they can beat the horse
2021-04-27 14:25:43,wallstreetbets,Still is.
2021-04-27 15:58:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah like where all the diamond hands folks. Every muthafucka sells. Be careful on this board with weak paper fucks

2021-04-27 13:49:20,wallstreetbets,Felt. For once I made the right choice and sold at 29 before it tanked lmao.
2021-04-27 13:45:19,wallstreetbets,Hope you sold in after hours. Went up 10% after market close yesterday.
2021-04-27 15:10:14,wallstreetbets,"'didn't fuck myself *yet*'

GME still has plenty of disappointment left in her"
2021-04-27 16:18:34,wallstreetbets,Got rid of my calls at market open. Best decision ever. Putting it directly into mnmd was not. Fml.

2021-04-27 13:52:46,wallstreetbets,MVIS has no earnings and has been around for 30 years. What makes you think this time is different?
2021-04-27 16:19:15,wallstreetbets,buy the rumor sell the news. by thursday this anticipation will already be priced in with no more room for the stock to run
2021-04-27 16:37:14,wallstreetbets,y’all never learn. You’re all gonna get massacred for holding. Same as Tesla battery day. u been warned
2021-04-27 17:09:59,wallstreetbets,what will be so earth shattering for Thursday’s CC regarding a demo?
2021-04-27 16:28:44,wallstreetbets,sell the news retard
2021-04-27 15:29:30,wallstreetbets,"Haha -- same, but I learned my lesson from CLOV. While WSB may not intend it, by the time we start seeing all this DD, you can assume it's close to dumping."
2021-04-27 12:36:46,wallstreetbets,"This is the way. 

Listen to Wall Street bets, get loss porn. 

Do the opposite of WSB, get fuck you’s and green numbers."

2021-04-27 11:48:06,wallstreetbets,Do you know why you bought? If so then nothing has changed and at least wait till after the Thursday call to make a move
2021-04-27 13:25:30,wallstreetbets,Gonna buy another 100 bucks worth tomorrow
2021-04-27 12:51:07,wallstreetbets,Should I grab another 100 shares 😂
2021-04-27 12:33:05,wallstreetbets,"Lol it's down to 19, grab some more"
2021-04-27 13:57:40,wallstreetbets,Now you too can get the BB experience without actually buying BB
2021-04-27 12:53:14,wallstreetbets,no. the time to jump in has passed. it probably wont just go big again for another week
2021-04-27 12:44:39,wallstreetbets,They can pry it out of my cold dead fingers I'll hold that fucker for spite.
2021-04-27 14:45:41,wallstreetbets,"I’m in at 10.13cost basis and holding for the presumed merger cause that is the real play here.

2021-04-27 18:37:13,wallstreetbets,I know I could have bought it at 5 like a smort guy.
2021-04-27 17:00:53,wallstreetbets,"That's... The way?
Obviously not the way to financial gains, but still... It's *my* way!"
2021-04-27 12:29:09,wallstreetbets,Same dropped 1.2k on it for the lulz and grabbed 1 gme to watch it swing!
2021-04-27 13:14:36,wallstreetbets,"I started actually buying stocks that the smooth brains here were talking about with GME. Lost a pretty good amount. Learned my lesson, made money on Rocket, MVIS, etc.

Word of (not financial) advice- buy early- after the second big post about a ticker but before the fourth or fifth. (Almost) Never buy at market open- the premarket rise will fuck you over. And set stop limits frequently as the price starts going up, trail behind it by a fixed amount.

My trading history looks like a half pipe when I started trading WSB stocks. You'll get better at it, don't be discouraged."

You know you coulda encouraged me with the same key strokes you used to be a fucking nipple-dick. I didn’t do anything to you and I’m trying to learn.

2021-04-27 18:39:18,wallstreetbets,"WSBs made this a meme. It will most likely only effect short term price action.

If you do your research you'd understand why some people have owned this stock for years prior to this."
2021-04-27 19:50:01,wallstreetbets,Same. Cost is around 15 and I’m sticking around.
2021-04-27 14:13:14,wallstreetbets,i sold it then bought that dip. lol
2021-04-27 17:57:02,wallstreetbets,"That's what I though, what are all these people crying about?"

2021-04-27 13:15:54,wallstreetbets,What’s not down right now? 😂
2021-04-27 14:37:39,wallstreetbets,Buy it again when it dips close to initial investment price
2021-04-27 14:34:19,wallstreetbets,There can be only one

2021-04-27 17:14:14,wallstreetbets,Sigh.  I was up 125% hoping it does something by the end of the week
2021-04-27 16:06:54,wallstreetbets,What’d you own four shares?  are you celebrating over like 20$ profit?
2021-04-27 18:14:46,wallstreetbets,">Got 100% profit instead of 150%

Judging by this math... you bought three shares?

This sub has gone to shit lol"
2021-04-27 14:31:37,wallstreetbets,"It was only shorted for 20% what did the retards expect?

But since they don't do DD anyway"

2021-04-27 14:36:53,wallstreetbets,Same. Bought today. Down $7k+ at the moment.
2021-04-27 16:23:01,wallstreetbets,Still chance to make up ground. Buy the dips to average down. I put another stop limit buy at $17 for tomorrow morning
2021-04-27 13:58:10,wallstreetbets,"Sigh, I’ll keep repeating it on every thread and hope it sticks.

No one cares about the financials for this weeks earnings call. It’s different this time because MVIS has been developing their A-Sample “best in class” automotive LiDAR module that can be used for self driving cars which is a HUGE emerging sector. The LiDAR module is “complete” and the ceo mentioned they were demoing to customers in the month of April. They also have an AR vertical that is used in hololens 2 which just got a 23 BILLION dollar contract.

I can’t speak for MVIS for the other 25+ years but the verticals they’re working on in 2021 are HOT in demand"
2021-04-27 16:05:16,wallstreetbets,It was a 7 dollar stock in February. Things definitely seem different than the last 3 decades.

2021-04-27 13:53:43,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I saw a post about it with a lot of text. That means buy."
2021-04-27 15:21:48,wallstreetbets,I hope you’re right.  I was up a nice amount and now is skydiving in my face and I’m just gonna hold
2021-04-27 13:01:34,wallstreetbets,No this is too high risk at this point. The media are already all over this.
2021-04-27 13:56:11,wallstreetbets,grabbed another 1k @ 20
2021-04-27 13:01:59,wallstreetbets,At this point id be happy just to get my losses back.... hold till then lol

2021-04-27 15:17:57,wallstreetbets,"no offense but youve only been trading a couple months and this is hilarious to read given that

no way to know if youre simply getting lucky lately and were unlucky before rather than getting better at anything"
2021-04-27 13:59:49,wallstreetbets,Stop limits <- if ur not using these you just hate money
2021-04-27 14:48:49,wallstreetbets,This is beginner question but what do you mean by “trail behind it by a fixed amount” in relation to stop limits?
2021-04-27 19:24:17,wallstreetbets,Same here. Although it looks more like a moon crater for me.
2021-04-27 18:06:33,wallstreetbets,Attempting to save you from financial ruin. Keep yolo trading on margin bro. Lmfao.
2021-04-27 19:59:10,wallstreetbets,But then the stock is going to do the opposite of what the coin flip says!
2021-04-27 17:42:08,wallstreetbets,Somebody calling me?
2021-04-27 11:39:27,wallstreetbets,I’m a newb with only 13 shares at 10.19. What happens to me if Microsoft buys out MVIS?
2021-04-27 13:56:26,wallstreetbets,"If a big name company were going to buy them out for their technology, it would have happened last year when the stock was near zero."
2021-04-27 18:17:53,wallstreetbets,You have literally no reason to expect a buy out

2021-04-27 16:31:01,wallstreetbets,"Man, how would anyone know what the bottom is? Do you think we can tell the future?"
2021-04-27 18:44:13,wallstreetbets,"Oh for sure, but at this point the price action for people asking for DD on this company today in spring 2020, the memes are all that matters. Of course I would have loved to buy in for $3 in 2017. But short term is what people are asking about now."
2021-04-27 14:18:02,wallstreetbets,why do you think it will go back up ?
2021-04-27 17:59:34,wallstreetbets,Exactly!!!! I think their earnings eill be good. But if you look at their history on earnings it usually tanks and the rebounds pretty quick
2021-04-27 13:21:08,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. I knew I should have sold last night too 😂
2021-04-27 15:33:45,wallstreetbets,Why is that power hour?

Forreal tho I'm in a lot of debt and don't have much money to do anything with. I put maybe 100-150 in every few months."

2021-04-27 14:53:50,wallstreetbets,"Not everything is a short squeeze, my goodness. There are other reasons stock prices rise and fall."
2021-04-27 14:38:52,wallstreetbets,Where do you find that information?
2021-04-27 16:27:05,wallstreetbets,What does short interest have to do with it? I’m looking for a buyout.
2021-04-27 15:11:59,wallstreetbets,I honestly think it was Citadel behind the hype. Fintel shows that they bought 250k shares back in December and on 4/16 they bought puts
2021-04-27 17:09:47,wallstreetbets,It definitely hit 29 AH because I bought in at 28.8
2021-04-27 16:33:08,wallstreetbets,Sold at $29 and made 1200 dollars.
2021-04-27 18:44:33,wallstreetbets,"Have you never been in a stock before that’s ran up 260% in one week and had **only** a 25% pullback?? That’s not even close to a nuclear meltdown. I have many examples I can give you over the years, this is not one one of them at all."
2021-04-27 15:06:22,wallstreetbets,You can sell pre-market or after hours if your broker allows.
2021-04-27 13:29:59,wallstreetbets,uh huh
2021-04-27 15:16:12,wallstreetbets,Its out to a year now!?
2021-04-27 16:58:54,wallstreetbets,"So will you buy tomorrow or wait for it to pull back even lower? It's hard to time these things. It might run again real fast. If you could time the top and bottom of things nearly perfectly, you'd be a millionaire in a week. Just buy, hold for the buy out and make incredible tendies."
2021-04-27 12:53:03,wallstreetbets,"Turn the screen upside down, you'll see it goes up 😁"
2021-04-27 13:00:31,wallstreetbets,Can’t do the tits thing!!!
2021-04-27 15:24:48,wallstreetbets,It’s over. This was a flash in the pants.
2021-04-27 12:59:01,wallstreetbets,I Effie hope so
2021-04-27 13:34:38,wallstreetbets,What happens on Thursday?
2021-04-27 14:56:32,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry- unlike GME this thing has crazy tech backing it’s value. This push from Reddit was nice but the real growth will be far more exciting. Gotta b patient though
2021-04-27 19:15:12,wallstreetbets,The fact its still up 171% from 3 months ago didnt put you off buying? You belong here 😂. Soon as something makes front pages of wsb thats your key to sell or buy puts
2021-04-27 16:26:29,wallstreetbets,I should probably make smaller buys till I learn more.
2021-04-27 15:38:02,wallstreetbets,"man I hope you're right....I made $1400 yesterday, and like a donkey bought at opened with THAT $30 strike everyone was yapping about...and now I lost all I made and more."
2021-04-27 17:09:37,wallstreetbets,"+1 Apple is coming out with AR.. They are playing catch up with MVIS. They were ahead of their time. That and LIDAR Is the true answer to self-driving vehicles... plus their patents... The company is easily worth 10 -15 bil.
So bail out on possible $60-100 not me. I'm locked in. DD my friends."
2021-04-27 19:21:16,wallstreetbets,So they basically have reservations for a product that doesnt exist. Got it!
2021-04-27 14:28:33,wallstreetbets,"But this is already known and might be already reflected in the actual price.
If there would be something on top, I’m with you... but I guess this will dump again to $15-16"
2021-04-27 16:42:31,wallstreetbets,The hype about this has already been bought by retail/institutions and factored in.
2021-04-27 14:19:14,wallstreetbets,LiDAR is a dead-end for automated driving - Elon
2021-04-27 16:08:57,wallstreetbets,It was $500 20 years ago and then sank to near zero for 20 years
2021-04-27 13:05:37,wallstreetbets,That's pretty much the rule.  If it's been climbing for a week.  And you jump in.  That's your own ass.  It doesn't go on forever.
2021-04-27 15:10:07,wallstreetbets,"This is it. I got in MVIS at 11 last week, obviously i dont love to see todays drop but im still up so im happy to wait until thursday. If it tanks, so be it, ill pull out before i actually make a loss."
2021-04-27 17:59:37,wallstreetbets,I listened to the guy that posted about EDIT and bought same day ... not doing so hot there
2021-04-27 19:53:08,wallstreetbets,THIS is the way
2021-04-27 12:57:54,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-27 14:11:11,wallstreetbets,266 right now bought at 27.60.
2021-04-27 14:45:59,wallstreetbets,"It was this or a new deer rifle, at least I can do this inside lol."
2021-04-27 14:01:16,wallstreetbets,lol i know you’re joking but the DD is very legitimate. I’ve bought meme stocks on WSB in the past and i decided to go all in on MVIS months ago after seeing what they’re working on. It truly is revolutionary
2021-04-27 13:53:15,wallstreetbets,Have been.  Tell tale MSM.

2021-04-27 16:38:37,wallstreetbets,"Short interest in MicroVision stood at about 18.7% of the float, with 29.37 million of the company's stock sold short as of Friday's close, according to S3 Partners.

The number of shares shorted increased by 1.4 million in the last seven days, showing some investors placed bearish bets as the shares have rallied, said S3's Ihor Dusaniwsky.

""We are seeing shorting into a red-hot stock as shorts are looking for a pullback,"" Dusaniwsky said.

But bearish investors could be ""squeezed out of their positions due to losses"" if the shares continue rallying, he said.

In Monday's trading alone, short sellers were showing mark-to-market losses of $227 million on the day when the stock was trading at $25.69, Dusaniwsky said.

The squeeze could be out of the question but it’s not all covered."
2021-04-27 16:12:40,wallstreetbets,Throwing another 300 in tomorrow.
2021-04-27 13:30:11,wallstreetbets,I'm with you there! It definitely spices up my Mondays to be excited about market open.

2021-04-27 14:10:22,wallstreetbets,"With no pretext or communication? I'm sure a lot of companies were purchased due to the pandemic, but that's not of Microsoft works. They'll work on projects together until they know 80% of microvisions process. Then offer to buy MVIS or destroy their market with a copy of MVIS's technology. At least that my humble opinion."
2021-04-27 15:48:17,wallstreetbets,Can you just make a GTC+EXT order?  That’s what I do on Ameritrade
2021-04-27 17:44:11,wallstreetbets,Stfu. I was just asking for an opinion. That’s what most of this sub is. Not a dumbass comment.
2021-04-27 18:49:16,wallstreetbets,"Okay that's understandable.

 It's just ridiculous seeing all of the cruddy DD on WSB for MVIS.. and most stocks lol. Only playing with meme stocks in the market.. this is why most people dont make money trading. They cant control their emotions, or spend the time to do deep and real research.

Gotta learn how to value a company long term.. and understand catalysts for the short term. WSB made this a meme stock short term. Those who hold will be happiest."

2021-04-27 16:24:19,wallstreetbets,At least it’s entertaining. GME is a boomer stock now propped up by bag holders so it’s been stale af to watch
2021-04-27 17:11:41,wallstreetbets,"I'll wait when it hits $15, I missed the initial run, but after reading the DD, i think it's a solid $20 stock until it gets bought out."
2021-04-27 16:15:29,wallstreetbets,You didn’t miss the GME spike
2021-04-27 18:06:00,wallstreetbets,"I bought at 10 and sold at 17. Missed the run to 25. Next time, i be like you and leave some in play. Be back down and running again in a week or 2."

2021-04-27 15:58:58,wallstreetbets,"I earn $300 from a call option yesterday and got greedy today. Bought $25 call option of 2k and now I am fucked totally. Not sure, this will recover tomorrow or will go down![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)"
2021-04-27 17:05:58,wallstreetbets,Lol 😂 that sucks I was up too not any more!!!
2021-04-27 14:39:39,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, maybe not. No one knows for sure i suppose. At the very core the Thursday meeting is just one layer of the cake to help explain MVIS to noobies. In reality the longs don’t even care about Thursday and are waiting for a buyout"
2021-04-27 17:58:26,wallstreetbets,Up to $21.45 after hours right now.  I bought 50 at $22 and 50 at $20... I don’t think this ride is over.
2021-04-27 19:38:36,wallstreetbets,If it dumps below 15 I’m buying 20 shares
2021-04-27 18:47:48,wallstreetbets,"No chance, everyone is waiting on the edge of their seats and if the best in class lidar is finally proven then it’s going to blow past 30 and probably 40 very quickly. And it won’t stop until it’s past LAZR’s market cap since that’s all the proof the market needs that MVIS > LAZR."
2021-04-27 14:21:03,wallstreetbets,How many fatal crashes had Tesla had again?
2021-04-27 14:18:14,wallstreetbets,Except for gme but that probably proves to be the exception for everything
2021-04-27 18:32:31,wallstreetbets,"I also bought in at 11 last week, just sold off 75% of my shares throughout yesterday afternoon as it hit $22 up to $26. Holding the other 25% to see where it goes."
2021-04-27 15:56:12,wallstreetbets,Where have you actually seen or read about their technology other than on social media or hype by the CEO?
2021-04-27 14:05:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah I saw a post last week when it was like $12 and didn’t buy. Bought yesterday at 23. I don’t have real money to invest any way so I’m not missing out on much
2021-04-27 16:40:53,wallstreetbets,Ah ok interesting ty
2021-04-27 13:31:57,wallstreetbets,Yeah I was excited to get up and prep for market open.
2021-04-27 15:22:52,wallstreetbets,"Thats more clear but also that pattern doesnt always hold, some just flop altogether while others rocket even well after the sub hype is in full force"
2021-04-27 15:22:53,wallstreetbets,"Before I was just doing ETFs, high dividend yield stocks, long term slow growth stuff. Didn't start with the risky stuff till recently. Although you're not wrong, I've only been doing the WSB stuff recently so it's true that I may have just been getting lucky."
2021-04-27 12:51:30,wallstreetbets,This is the correct answer (if it is an all-cash buyout). Set to happen to shares of Nuance NUAN at $56/share sometime in the next year.
2021-04-27 11:43:15,wallstreetbets,Tyty
2021-04-27 17:52:47,wallstreetbets,What happens if the shares go to the moon and they simply can't afford to pay everyone the value their shares are worth at the moment?
2021-04-27 14:43:57,wallstreetbets,"I would have thought they would want to snap them up last year while cheap tho, given they use their components in Hololens - not are why they would buy them now if they didn’t previously .."
2021-04-27 17:45:55,wallstreetbets,You need some common sense you fucking hick
2021-04-27 14:41:07,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-04-27 18:18:07,wallstreetbets,I was just reading and yeah there are alot of employees that used to work at microsoft and now work at microvision. Who knows. Only time will tell
2021-04-27 15:56:01,wallstreetbets,Ok... Don't have a investment related discussion on an investing forum then...
2021-04-27 16:26:59,wallstreetbets,"I mean im not into labelling stocks that way, call me a boomer, but to me theres good plays, bad plays and risky plays, and to me GME is a good goddamn play :)"
2021-04-27 16:27:40,wallstreetbets,I’m just waiting to buy at the peak.. I’m so good at doing that
2021-04-27 16:57:30,wallstreetbets,"Long on GME, renewables, alt energy sources, batteries."
2021-04-27 16:36:25,wallstreetbets,"I just kinda regret buying at 40, selling at 80, then rebuying at 70, 120, 150 etc."
2021-04-27 16:25:32,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-27 16:59:37,wallstreetbets,"It’s not relevant to the common wsb thesis on MVIS. No one is talking about a short squeeze, because we’re either playing for Thursday’s ER, or waiting for a buyout. 

AFAIK no one is pushing this as a squeeze play."
2021-04-27 17:27:42,wallstreetbets,I think the first 5 words of your sentence answers it
2021-04-27 17:15:07,wallstreetbets,"I said I bought after hours

And you then say I have no idea how hard it is to buy after hours

Also it is not hard it is exactly the same process what the fuck is wrong with you, are you a special kind of stupid or something? Are you buying your shares on a street corner from some dude you know or something? it is 2021 the moterfucking information age moron trading shares ends at 8 no 4."

2021-04-27 13:52:11,wallstreetbets,his comments arent sincere. hes just playing a role.
2021-04-27 13:52:29,wallstreetbets,That’s very biblical of you.
2021-04-27 19:44:53,wallstreetbets,ouch i hope this thing turns around for you man
2021-04-27 17:07:03,wallstreetbets,Ty for making me feel better about not profiting $75 yesterday on 6 shares lol
2021-04-27 18:16:18,wallstreetbets,Thank you for buying those from me
2021-04-27 19:47:39,wallstreetbets,fingers crossed for you man - let’s turn this shiz around!

💎 🙌🏻"
2021-04-27 15:03:20,wallstreetbets,"This buy-out possibility indeed is a interesting point to for investing. 
I paper handed today with a nice gain. But if it drops a bit more I’ll get back in by tomorrow."
2021-04-27 18:28:09,wallstreetbets,Wish you luck and increasing price for tomorrow and Thursday.

2021-04-27 18:49:22,wallstreetbets,"GME didn’t go up forever, in fact it crashed much, much harder (multiple times) than the 25% MVIS did today, and MVIS is already swinging back up AH."
2021-04-27 14:09:35,wallstreetbets,Any amount of money is important my friend. 10 years ago i couldn’t fathom investing more than 400-500 and now I’m playing with 40000-50000
2021-04-27 15:26:59,wallstreetbets,"If WSB was always right, I'd bet we could get Cramer's timeslot. And what a show that would be."

2021-04-27 16:29:46,wallstreetbets,I would say it’s more risky than a good play but that’s why we’re on WSB.
2021-04-27 16:28:53,wallstreetbets,You have 10 million in capital ready to invest? dang good luck 🤝
2021-04-27 18:26:47,wallstreetbets,I see your brain is as smooth as mine...
2021-04-27 19:35:09,wallstreetbets,I bought a weed stock at 73 LOL I know all about buying at the peak.
2021-04-27 19:07:36,wallstreetbets,And crayons.
2021-04-27 19:13:08,wallstreetbets,Are you familiar with AMYZF? They were the only publicly traded lithium battery recycler I could find. Apparently they have a good patented process for it.
2021-04-27 16:40:25,wallstreetbets,Ew of course you day trade glad you sold and missed out
2021-04-27 16:27:01,wallstreetbets,poor guy
2021-04-27 17:52:27,wallstreetbets,From what i've read it's a short squeeze play. Why did you think it almost reached 50% up with no news.
2021-04-27 17:37:33,wallstreetbets,Yea it depends on the broker tbh like some make you set limit prices instead of just buying market but like it takes the IQ of toom temperature water to figure that out.
2021-04-27 17:54:47,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-27 16:18:01,wallstreetbets,You paper handed pussy!!!
2021-04-27 14:58:19,wallstreetbets,Yikes. This couldn’t be further from fact..
2021-04-27 15:08:29,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, just like how a sober human is best at chess... wait, no, best at GO... hmm, not that either... Oh! That Ken Jennings was a sober human! He was pretty good at Jeopardy! Oh, beaten by Watson. Hmm.

AI can be completely dedicated to one task. AI can interlink and know *exactly* what *all* the other cars (assuming we don't let sober humans drive anymore) are about to do. The only time a ""sober human"" is better than an AI at, well, anything, is before we have a completed AI for the task. It doesn't even have to be *perfect* it just has to be better than the average person, which for driving is a pretty low bar.

And what kinda metric is ""a sober human"" anyway? Does every person have identical driving ability provided they're not intoxicated? And your caveat of ""if they're not distracted"" is kinda funny, considering computers can't really get distracted and human focus becomes harder to maintain the longer you try. But even if you found some superhuman who can't be distracted a self-driving AI will still out-perform them."
2021-04-27 15:53:36,wallstreetbets,"Tesla has a product, MVIS does not"
2021-04-27 15:39:22,wallstreetbets,MDMN was trending this morning on WSB....
2021-04-27 19:44:08,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino.
2021-04-27 18:16:58,wallstreetbets,No way they’d put that on cable. The indecency fines would be outrageous.

2021-04-27 19:38:05,wallstreetbets,FOMO is a hella of a drug.
2021-04-27 18:24:13,wallstreetbets,Because LIDAR press release on Thursday and buyout rumors. If you thought this was a short squeeze play that says more about yourself. Also MVIS does this like every other week.

2021-04-27 15:58:29,wallstreetbets,A lot of those guys bought in prior to it being openly traded.
2021-04-27 16:29:58,wallstreetbets,Nice. I wish I would’ve paper handed this morning on my MVIS aswell and then bought some more at the end of the day. I live and I try to learn pretty hard for a retard though.
2021-04-27 15:00:42,wallstreetbets,No it’s computers and LiDAR that think and act quicker than the best human driver ever could. It’s supported by math and science...kid.
2021-04-27 15:36:48,wallstreetbets,"Nice! What you did is called a ""straw man"", you had no real way to refute any of my arguments so you attacked the one thing that you could - then attacked my overall intelligence based on that to discredit everything else I said.

Okay, so, I didn't *compare* driving a car to chess and Jeopardy! I gave examples of things at which AI has already bested man at, objectively so. 

*No human can beat AI at chess anymore. No-one.* 

*That* was my argument: it took time for the AI to be developed but once it was, AI has been better at chess since 1997.

If you would like to debate any of the *actual* points I made then have at it, champ!"
2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Yoled everything on GME. I believe the price will continue to go up.

2021-04-27 10:46:12,wallstreetbets,At least you bought very near the money so you have a reasonable chance of pulling a profit out of this.
2021-04-27 12:25:01,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I would have went out a little further on the expiration but that’s not true a yolo, is it? 

That said, these should easily print. Hope you sell and drop some profit into shares too! 

I have two 5/7 calls that I need to sell soon but I am in the middle of a RH to fidelity transfer."
2021-04-27 11:16:52,wallstreetbets,Yikes not call options. GME is too hard to time. I lost a lot on calls for this stock. Good luck.
2021-04-27 14:56:26,wallstreetbets,I’m sure someone over at r/Thetagang was happy to take your money
2021-04-27 17:00:45,wallstreetbets,I really hope so. I joined this party at $185

2021-04-27 13:57:49,wallstreetbets,Shares is the way. Good luck anyway

2021-04-27 17:37:38,wallstreetbets,At least you bought plenty of time...

2021-04-27 19:19:58,wallstreetbets,If I can only afford one share of GME is it worth it?
2021-04-27 11:23:05,wallstreetbets,Just bought 3 of those
2021-04-27 13:19:36,wallstreetbets,"I would close that and open some debit spreads if you must use options for you yolo. Or at least out the money naked calls. The premium you're paying for that is crazy. Do you think it will be 500 by your expiration or 1k, 5k, 10k or what? If you think 5k then your best return right now is $430 call. If $500 then a 360/370 debit spread. Use this to figure out your greatest return [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/option-finder.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/option-finder.html)"

Yeah.  
Every time there's ""10% up"" news it will go up 10%.  
Then slowly fade back to where it was or worse.  
Occasionally there will be ""20% up"" news.  
Then back to where it was...  
There is no 100% up news.  
There is no 90% up news.  
There is most likely no 80% up news.  
Maybe there is 50% up news.  
Regardless, its back to where it was...

2021-04-27 16:13:09,wallstreetbets,I’d push your calls to the first week in June. Looks like when they’re expecting real volatility.

2021-04-27 16:43:53,wallstreetbets,"Oof $24,000 on a bet expiring in two weeks thats too rich for my blood lol"

2021-04-27 17:54:59,wallstreetbets,These are options. How about you buy shares nate

2021-04-27 18:12:09,wallstreetbets,"Sure as fuck YOLO’d it all....while using RH, the ultimate YOLO, good luck"

2021-04-27 18:19:27,wallstreetbets,Buys short OTM GME calls on RH. My man you deserve to lose all your money. Why are so few people selling puts on GME instead? That's the way. Hold a nice amount of shares and play theta with more money.
2021-04-27 18:21:01,wallstreetbets,please get off stealing from your hood robin.

2021-04-27 19:22:41,wallstreetbets,You are an absolute maniac playing options on GME rn.  I hope it moons and you get paid before the 7th.

2021-04-27 15:01:23,wallstreetbets,Was gonna call you a stupid fuck for buying calls when that doesnt help a gamma squeeze but I see you picked up some nice near-ATM options. Do your thang

2021-04-27 14:38:42,wallstreetbets,This is the way..

2021-04-27 15:05:48,wallstreetbets,Hey question bro. I wanna leave RH cuz they suck ass. How does one transfer from one to the other? I already opened a fidelity its all ready to go.

2021-04-27 10:45:28,wallstreetbets,I'm already seeing a 300 dollar gain. The real question Is when to sell. Or else I'll be left holding the bag.
2021-04-27 14:20:39,wallstreetbets,The way
2021-04-27 15:39:49,wallstreetbets,He could own 1500 shares by May 7th. With a 187 purchase price.
2021-04-27 15:50:57,wallstreetbets,Or buy options because this is wallstreetbets and not r/Investing
2021-04-27 15:04:42,wallstreetbets,buy the options so you can use the profits for shares. this guy just has wrinkles on his brain and is doing it smart.
2021-04-27 15:45:33,wallstreetbets,Options are the way to go if you want maximum leverage.
2021-04-27 13:39:46,wallstreetbets,This is quite the conundrum. I buy shares then I see someone gets rich off options. So I buy options then I regret not buying shares when I see red. But then sometimes I see green and I make an easy thousand or so off options. Which I can put back into shares. GME finally broke the 170 mark to 180 today. So I went all in one options. My only regret is I should have set a higher expiration date.
2021-04-27 19:05:51,wallstreetbets,Buying ATM or slightly OTM calls takes more shares off the market than buying the same dollars' worth of shares. Ever notice how GME really rips when people post tons of GME call YOLOs?
2021-04-27 15:38:50,wallstreetbets,Makes perfect sense.
2021-04-27 19:08:56,wallstreetbets,I think end of May is a far safer bet. New rules/regulations are in play by then that may initiate launch sequence.
2021-04-27 13:03:23,wallstreetbets,"Man this is WSB why does everyone discourage call options.  I get it, y'all believe in the squeeze, in it for the long-haul, etc. etc. but if we discourage YOLO's here what's the difference between us and r/investing?"
2021-04-27 15:28:19,wallstreetbets,This is WSB!!! an all in YOLO on options is encouraged.
2021-04-27 17:02:03,wallstreetbets,🚀 🚀
2021-04-27 17:11:42,wallstreetbets,You know what this means? People are actually still buying GME at the top. Which means I still have people I can sell my options to if the price goes higher. As long as people believe it will go higher.

2021-04-27 13:46:48,wallstreetbets,You should spend some time to learn your greeks. Volume is drying up even if the price goes up your options will lose value based on that. If it trades sideways you’ll basically lose nearly 70%

2021-04-27 16:45:11,wallstreetbets,yeah if he has $300k in cash to do that lol
2021-04-27 17:54:28,wallstreetbets,"The reason apes suggest buying shares and not calls is that GME options are incredibly overpriced right now (implied volatility just completely ridiculous). By buying calls, especially OTM calls which may expire worthless, you're essentially refilling the market makers' coffers and extending their solvency (i.e. delaying the squeeze).

Look, we're all retards, we all understand why options are better than shares, but GME is an exception."
2021-04-27 15:47:57,wallstreetbets,"If they finish ITM yes, but as we’ve seen hedge funds can mess with the price for a long time."
2021-04-27 15:29:28,wallstreetbets,Lmao I bought options a month ago for 15k and now it's worth 1k. Only hold if you have diamond titties
2021-04-27 14:20:43,wallstreetbets,"Do whatever works for you. These people keep preaching shares and also say they’re not giving financial advice. ??

Options are obviously better if you expect a large move and can beat theta to the punch."
2021-04-27 14:34:33,wallstreetbets,Don't listen to anyone who isn't posting their own position. 90% of people have 1 share...never take advice from a wendys employee unless it is about their food.

2021-04-27 13:16:15,wallstreetbets,"He’s saying for GME... for any other stock, sure, but call options just aren’t reliable for GME. Learned that lesson the hard way :)"
2021-04-27 17:38:57,wallstreetbets,GME is almost certainly being actively manipulated to hurt the value of options specifically. The company just sold half a billion in shares and the stock has traded sideways...

2021-04-27 15:37:15,wallstreetbets,This is WSB we also call out stupidity
2021-04-27 17:59:30,wallstreetbets,"Options are not shares. If this spikes, your counterparty on the option (often a computer algorithm) will want to buy your option simply to close out their obligation and cut losses. If you let the option ride to expiration and the call is in the money, your counterparty will be forced to deliver shares to you for the strike price (losing money compared to market price, which is higher). Most options never see expiry, and most of the ones that do expire worthless. So yeah, when you sell your ITM option close to expiration, good chance it was to somebody who is short that option."
2021-04-27 12:43:42,wallstreetbets,Good bot. Happy cake day.
2021-04-27 18:27:38,wallstreetbets,"Um this is bullshit, stock can go up and calls can still expire otm"
2021-04-27 10:49:31,wallstreetbets,Ditto
2021-04-27 12:19:03,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-27 13:24:20,wallstreetbets,For any other stock yes. Gme is for shares
2021-04-27 13:02:05,wallstreetbets,"while you are technically correct, this is also a share sub in some situations."
2021-04-27 11:39:10,wallstreetbets,Hoes mad
2021-04-27 13:24:46,wallstreetbets,Good thing i’ve been here longer than 4 months
2021-04-27 13:44:50,wallstreetbets,"Welp, I wish you luck. Also have a call btw and super bullish"
2021-04-27 14:04:52,wallstreetbets,"Sheesh calm down, I just believe they’ll crush the e-commerce business idea, I’m long for GME that’s all. Is believing bad?"
2021-04-27 14:33:01,wallstreetbets,"I'm all for a good yolo, but I'd sell those calls if they manage to get to a 10% gain as others have stated and buy shares while reading up a little more on greeks and some different option strategies. Then again, what better way to learn than through fire and you're in a position that you have $20k of discretionary income, so maybe you'll do well. Godspeed."
2021-04-27 14:24:35,wallstreetbets,"I think you should buy shares honestly. This isn't the time, or the stock, or the amount to learn options. But if you do want to yolo and think the stock price will be above 1k by next Friday I would spread some naked calls out by buying calls around the top of the chain strikes and really different dates. But honestly the IV is so jacked that shares are best if you don't use more complex options strategies."
2021-04-27 14:20:17,wallstreetbets,Leave budget empty. If you're unfamiliar just do naked calls.
2021-04-27 12:40:37,wallstreetbets,This seems more like WallStreetDonations though
2021-04-27 11:13:46,wallstreetbets,Your right I can't read thanks
2021-04-27 11:14:46,wallstreetbets,Yea only been here since before 2 mil
2021-04-27 13:20:44,wallstreetbets,I think you have a chance but theta is going to burn up that cash if it doesnt pop. I dropped another 30k into shares last week because i knew it was time for an uptrend. I wish i wouldve bought calls but ive burnt enough cash on calls trying to time it. Ive made enough off of shares becaus3 it gives me time. Good luck to you though
2021-04-27 12:57:51,wallstreetbets,just commenting so i can come back later to this
2021-04-27 14:19:40,wallstreetbets,"I wish you the best and I love me some options but this is... uh, good luck. Bearish on GME but I'd say get at least some shares just so you're not immediately blown the fuck out if drops $15-20 in a day."
2021-04-27 15:15:19,wallstreetbets,"Same, atleast you didn’t yolo mvis"

2021-04-27 15:38:11,wallstreetbets,Is it free?
2021-04-27 19:45:58,wallstreetbets,Now dumb question is that fidelity spire or fidelity investments?
2021-04-27 14:58:11,wallstreetbets,You are also more likely to always be in control of buying and selling your assets on Fidelity! Active Trader Pro on PC isn't bad.
2021-04-27 13:54:38,wallstreetbets,"Yea but when IV spikes up to 300+ again, his options will gain a ton of value."
2021-04-27 16:31:51,wallstreetbets,Not really. Volume has been its lowest ever for a couple days now. it’s bottomed already
2021-04-27 13:49:41,wallstreetbets,My only experience with Greeks was when I had a 7k options on GME months ago and realized it was losing value the longer i held even if the price reached higher than my asking bid. Which surprised me. Trying to learn from that. I made profit of that though so it's all good. Weird that volume is drying up. We had such a big discount on GME the past few weeks. But I didn't check any stats for it.
2021-04-27 12:56:00,wallstreetbets,"I know it looks bad since it's going down, But Pappa Warren said ""be greedy when others are fearful""."

2021-04-27 13:55:14,wallstreetbets,Nah yea it’s the same. It’s just that GME is a rare exception due to the extreme fuckery.
2021-04-27 12:06:54,wallstreetbets,"This isnt WSB any more, it's mostly GME cult."

2021-04-27 15:05:30,wallstreetbets,"Sell on the way down, not the way up!"
2021-04-27 10:59:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah IV on GME hasn’t been kind to options traders from what I’ve seen in the past. I wish you the best but don’t be too stingy
2021-04-27 18:47:13,wallstreetbets,Did you mean “solvability” - or maybe solubility or solvency?
2021-04-27 19:01:04,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-27 19:05:56,wallstreetbets,I sell the calls instead. The premiums are nice!
2021-04-27 19:06:54,wallstreetbets,"IV is stupid high on GME options, but it's actually less than GME's historical volatility at the moment. So they're not overpriced, just expensive."
2021-04-27 19:30:28,wallstreetbets,you can sell your contract before expiry
2021-04-27 17:30:59,wallstreetbets,They don't have to finish ITM to be profitible.
2021-04-27 15:33:34,wallstreetbets,All I can say is I'm sorry for your loss and I hope I don't end up like you.
2021-04-27 15:49:12,wallstreetbets,The average investment IQ of this sub is at this point a negative number.
2021-04-27 15:14:54,wallstreetbets,Man this is succinctly ruthless.
2021-04-27 18:10:49,wallstreetbets,Used to get an clowned and told to do back to investing

2021-04-27 16:58:07,wallstreetbets,"I'm not coming back to doing this shit till the sub I know and remember does. That'll either never happen, or won't until too many people get burned from this and a mass exodus happens. But fuck this GME APE shit might as well rename the sub to them at this point because this sub is dead."
2021-04-27 13:18:32,wallstreetbets,Except yall will only upvote GME to the top... sooo it's basically WallStreetGME even though there are 2 huge subs for it already.
2021-04-27 13:40:16,wallstreetbets,Same. Shit sucked.
2021-04-27 16:12:34,wallstreetbets,"That's kinda the point of gambling, bruh."
2021-04-27 15:55:57,wallstreetbets,"And yet, up above a few people called it out and are sitting at -30. What happened to this place?"
2021-04-27 18:11:35,wallstreetbets,Good that makes me feel better. Someone is going to want to buy my options then.
2021-04-27 12:43:03,wallstreetbets,"If you aren't yoloing all your money on $SPY FD's, what are you even doing with your life?"
2021-04-27 12:43:14,wallstreetbets,"Not butthurt. That’s cool if they want to buy shares. Especially in a meme stock. But, no one here should be shamed for buying options instead of shares."
2021-04-27 13:02:55,wallstreetbets,I mean shares are fine for a meme stock. I’m just pointing out that no one should be told here to buy shares instead of options.
2021-04-27 14:33:35,wallstreetbets,Actually this is my stimulus money. And I'm paying attention to the comments.
2021-04-27 14:20:48,wallstreetbets,Yes selling.
2021-04-27 17:55:50,wallstreetbets,lmao
2021-04-27 11:18:37,wallstreetbets,I’ve been here before it was over 100k. This is an options sub.
2021-04-27 13:06:24,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-27 15:16:19,wallstreetbets,$500 on mvis
2021-04-27 17:01:32,wallstreetbets,Not all 24k is stimmy money. I made a lot of money off GME using my original stimmy money. So I ended up with nearly 24 to 25k. Which I'm yoloing into GME.
2021-04-27 18:27:30,wallstreetbets,"Also don’t touch anything in your RH account, no new buys, sells, options, whatever. That will either really delay or straight up cancel the transfer."
2021-04-27 15:42:47,wallstreetbets,"$75 charge that is applied to the value of your stock and is only paid when you sell or you can just cover the cost yourself. Unless your account is greater than $25k in value, then Fidelity covers the RH transfer fee and it costs nothing. But all of that is irrelevant if the stock is $10,000,000 a share."
2021-04-27 17:54:48,wallstreetbets,SoFi pays for the $75 transfer fee if your account has at least 5k in stocks
2021-04-27 19:52:32,wallstreetbets,"No such thing as a dumb question, except that one 🤣 sorry I couldn’t resist. but they're the same thing. just different UI's"
2021-04-27 17:10:53,wallstreetbets,thanks i will check it out; admittedly the web/mobile interface is lacking. Although the multi-account position summaries are nice
2021-04-27 13:56:15,wallstreetbets,Not with GameStop though it looks like they are doing the dark pool manipulation again. I don’t see any major catalysts coming this week to push up volume again

2021-04-27 18:12:31,wallstreetbets,Down voted for spitting facts.
2021-04-27 13:19:51,wallstreetbets,I don’t follow either of those subs. I’m here for degenerates gambling away their money. Just because someone yolos money on something doesn’t mean I have to say it’s a good idea 🤷🏼‍♂️
2021-04-27 13:04:53,wallstreetbets,You forgot the 0DTE
2021-04-27 16:16:39,wallstreetbets,"Nothing wrong with doubling your stimmy! Biggest problem is that you have a short fuse on your options and high volatility is doing you no favors. Too bad you didn't buy yesterday prior to the news of completion of their ATM stock offering, because you would be in a great position. Assuming the current theta of -0.88 on your options, you're going to lose ~$1,350/day if there's no fluctuations in price. GME has consistently consolidated at different price points, and one that seems to keep coming up is $175/share or ~$12B market cap, so I don't see this price moving too much unless there's some more good news coming. What has worked well for me for GME is waiting for a price to consolidate and stay in a spread of of ~4% for at least a week and then making a move. I've been able to get in at $35 before the first run up, $42 before the second, and finally $150 before the current one. 

Comments here can be a double sided sword. You can learn a lot, but you can be talked out of your convictions. Imagine if DFV listened to everyone a year ago and didn't load up on various OTM calls? He wouldn't be sitting on $30M right now. 

I hope that you're able to triple that stimmy with whatever direction you decide to go!"
2021-04-27 15:12:11,wallstreetbets,y'all getting 20k stimulus checks now???
2021-04-27 15:16:35,wallstreetbets,You got paid 24k on stimis?
2021-04-27 13:21:24,wallstreetbets,Would have been cool if your brought up MVIS yesterday. Thats old news. Try again.
2021-04-27 15:33:47,wallstreetbets,Oh
2021-04-27 19:53:15,wallstreetbets,"Okay lol thanks, which you prefer or suggest?"
2021-04-27 15:07:38,wallstreetbets,"it just crossed to a reversal on the macd daily. 

it just passed over a giant bull wedge and is testing another even bigger wedge.

the last time there were the circumstances that there are today, this being both in february and january, it tripled in price.

past isn't always indicative of the future but there are many bullish indicators for this to be an exciting couple of weeks."
2021-04-27 15:12:45,wallstreetbets,BTW partial transfer from fidelity 2 weeks ago took 3 4 days. I partial transferred the rest Sunday night and it completed today.
2021-04-27 13:20:26,wallstreetbets,Short it bear
2021-04-27 13:01:52,wallstreetbets,If I do fail.  I can at least learn a valuable lesson on how not to invest in the future. But soo far yoloing has worked out for me so I will continue being a retard.
2021-04-27 13:39:45,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-27 15:12:44,wallstreetbets,More like 10k. Doubled my money from GME.
2021-04-27 15:17:13,wallstreetbets,No. More like 10k. I've made money along the way from GME
2021-04-27 15:34:59,wallstreetbets,I had spare money. I was going yolo everything on GME but I had 500 left over. I went to WSB today and all i heard talked about was MVIS. So I said screw it im throwing my remaining money on It.
2021-04-27 19:56:29,wallstreetbets,I don’t recommend anything to anyone. This is not financial advice. But I have both apps and personally use Fidelity investments more. The UI is a bit more complex but once you know how to navigate you have tons of control on your account.
2021-04-27 15:15:15,wallstreetbets,I just see it as a bull trap. They can control volume through the dark pools. I’m sure they were aware of the crazy ass triangle pattern on the chart. And then you have cocaine cramer hyping it. I think they let it rise this time on purpose. Why didn’t they use their available shares to short yesterday? I’m seeing the high possibility of a bull trap here
2021-04-27 13:37:12,wallstreetbets,"I have 203 shares, lol"
2021-04-27 13:42:01,wallstreetbets,"Valuable lesson? What valuable lesson will you get by not even understanding what is going on with GME. Bruh, lmaoooo 
There is literally no lesson on this topic.


Just even try to explain your idea what could be going on until that time... lol. 
Not even DFV the god has any options.

Edit: I have GME shares but not options lol"
2021-04-27 13:47:47,wallstreetbets,"I’m more libertarian minded, do whatever the fuck you want with your money. I’ll just sit here and jackoff to the loss porn."
2021-04-27 16:50:06,wallstreetbets,good for you
2021-04-27 15:24:11,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't this money meant for your kids? Haha, seriously, you got some balls; you picked a horrible call. From my own experience on GME, you can't chase this dragon. I've been here for $5 a share. My suggestion not it matters. Buy shares, wait to go up to $5-10 dollars profit, then sell."
2021-04-27 19:57:42,wallstreetbets,"Okay thanks, got what you meant lol, appreciate it"
2021-04-27 15:32:04,wallstreetbets,There have been multiple bull traps the past few weeks. This had to have been the highest one yet. I saw soo many people lose money by buying options only to have the stock go down. The fact it's maintaining 170 gives me some hope though.
2021-04-27 13:44:53,wallstreetbets,The Valuable lesson is if I fail don't buy options when you see an upward trend and you think it's going to pop off. I can learn that lesson.
2021-04-27 17:52:06,wallstreetbets,"Options really should be dealt with carefully my man. When you buy an option, not only are you saying ""I think the price will move up(call)/down(put) by X date"", you are ALSO saying ""I think volatility is cheap for this option and people will pay me more for volatility in the future"". GME is still one of the stocks with the highest implied volatility in the market, so even if it just goes up slow and steady you will STILL lose money due to theta decay and IV crush. If you wanna dabble in options, study. A LOT. If you don't wanna, stocks are honestly much safer since you can just hold and if your initial thesis was correct you win in the end, even if it takes a while."

2021-04-27 14:36:17,wallstreetbets,"Damn... Fair.

Is there a subreddit like WSB focused on penny stocks that seems to have some success?"
2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SWCH- and edge computing. 
I live in Vegas. Yesterday driving on the 215 passing Jones exit I notice that SWITCH (tech company) looks to be building out another big ass campus. I then checked out the company. I think there is a huge possibility here with edge computing coming down the line. The CEOs name is Rob Roy and has a great back story.

Anyone know more about this company? I understand the IoT is up and coming and Edge computing should be forefront.....big words just learnt them.

Please give input! 

APES- looks like they use a lot of red crayons when coloring the outside of the buildings. You like!

-not financial advice....I eat crayons with green ones being the preference. 

Beside the mods will probably take this down"
2021-04-27 10:33:48,wallstreetbets,Yup Switch is a huge datacenter and their datacenter setup is proprietary and extremely efficient. We rent a rack and have fiber in there and our network engineer has to be followed and watched and escorted by armed guards. It's really wild.
2021-04-27 10:46:17,wallstreetbets,I like them as a company but do not like the stock.  Valuation seems extremely high considering their foot print.  Look at Iron Mountain for example.  They have much larger footprint with very large government contracts.  Add in the extra business units such as paper storage and shredding they're a much better pick.  IRM revenue north of 4 billion versus 500 million for Switch.  Honestly I could see IRM buying switch.
2021-04-27 10:40:51,wallstreetbets,Interested
2021-04-27 11:01:00,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn’t being bought a good thing?

Being able to see the physical expansion of a company is quite reassuring when looking into the growth of a stock. IMO

Would you know if edge computing is implemented in autonomous car futures?"

EDIT 2: OP provided the link so I'm doing the math now  [https://imgur.com/a/LpcYIi6](https://imgur.com/a/LpcYIi6)

EDIT 3: OP only provided trade verification of 173,861 shares. We do not know his cost average or when he purchased the other 252,800 shares. Still waiting for a response.

FINAL EDIT:  OP added the rest of his trades here  [https://imgur.com/a/3RQBy8U](https://imgur.com/a/3RQBy8U) I did the rough math on his trades and seems like the cost average $3.56 checks out. Y'all can check it and do the math too.

2021-04-27 10:06:35,wallstreetbets,"New report this morning from undisclosed source follows rumors from last week of increased capital gains taxes.

**Key Points:**

* **Ending ""step-up basis"" for inheritances.**   the “step up in basis” loophole allows heirs to use the market value of assets at the time of inheritance rather than the actual purchase price as the cost basis for capital gains when the holdings are sold.  ending this would mean much higher tax bills for wealthy estates
* **Increase of tax rate for the highest bracket (>$400k) from 37% to 39.6%** - impacting around 1% of taxpayers that earn in this bracket.  (Reminder that US income tax is **progressive**, which means that only income over $400k is taxed at the 39.6% rate.)
* **$80B in new funding for the IRS** to audit wealthy individuals and companies, that some are estimating could generate $700B in revenue.   The IRS has long been calling for more resources, with Commissioner Chuck Rettig stating at a congressional panel that as much as $1T in taxes go uncollected each year.
* **Biden to reveal his ""American Families Plan"" to Congress on Wednesday (4/28/21)** - expected to cost from $1 to $1.8T - expected to feature funding for paid leave, childcare, and education.

2021-04-27 10:37:59,wallstreetbets,"Thoughts:

Let me know when you’re gonna do this so I can sell some stock and buy the dip.

The wealthy already shelter assets and mitigate taxes so this won’t raise nearly as much money as politicians assume it will, potentially leaving the middle class paying more to cover promises.

The government does a shit job of spending the money they already take in, so why don’t we fix those problems first."
2021-04-27 10:26:54,wallstreetbets,"Inheritance or Estate Tax is taxed only for amounts over $11.2 million per person or $22.4 million for a couple.  Does not apply to many people.  Also, the step up basis is very beneficial.  For example, if your parents bought Tesla stock at $20 per share that is now worth $700 per share - the cost basis to you would be $700 per share - the $680 per share gain is never taxed under Estate Tax rules."

Most other taxes make sense as fair payment for participating in the benefits of being in a society...but an inheritance tax is absurd.  I'd never cheat on my taxes but be damn sure I'll use every loophole to pay as little as possible.  The government should have no right to that money IMO.

2021-04-27 10:32:45,wallstreetbets,"Just as always, this will be most detrimental to the middle class. When you receive your $600k home from your parents after they pass that they bought for $35k back in the 80s/90s, 95% of middle class Americans will have to sell that home for a loss.  Most people cannot come up with an extra $10k for taxes a year, so you’ll be forced to fire sale to make the tax payments within the specified time frame.  Instead of receiving your $600k childhood home, you’re forced to sell at $450k, + losing all fees, taxes, etc - losing about half the value of your intended inheritance from your parents.

Capital gains taxes have no limit on your earnings but can only deduct $3k a year in losses. So if I lose $5k a year on the market I get at most (3,000*.20%) $600 back on my taxes.

Way to make sure the family never recovers.

2021-04-27 11:21:06,wallstreetbets,"The assumption that people in the lowest class are spending their money on iPhones rather than food and rent is pretty off base. 

Increasing taxes should benefit the lower classes. It helps reduce wealth inequality, it can help fund public works projects, it can be used to bolster our scientific output. The list goes on and on. 

The fact that you are using money that you’ve been taxed on is irrelevant because you don’t get taxed when you put that money into an investment account, rather you are only taxed on additional income you make from your investments. It’s basically the same thing as if you got a bonus from work. Additional income results in additional taxes. 

Long term capital gains tax being lower than the income tax rate only helps the rich avoid tax payments. For me I could return a profit of almost a quarter million each year and still be in the 24% tax bracket. Long term capital gains would reduce my tax burden by 9% but a guy who earns a million a year could save nearly 25% on his taxes. I do agree that you should not be limited to 3k a year for losses but having no limit seems like it would be ripe for abuse by the rich. A higher limit of like 25k would be nice while still allowing the excess to rollover."
2021-04-27 14:20:30,wallstreetbets,">	You want the lower class to get ahead in life, incentivize people to invest their money instead of always buying the latest iPhone

This is very out of touch. Besides the cringe ""just drink less Starbucks"" Boomer mindset, I can tell you as someone in the wireless sales business that the vast majority of lower class people aren't dropping $800+ on an iPhone upfront, or even at all. Typically it's part of a promotion, but even if it isn't, it's the cost spread over around 24-30 months. They don't have the full amount upfront to invest in the first place. 

Take AT&T, for example. Right now both new and existing customers can trade in an old phone like a 3 year old iPhone 8 and get $700 off an iPhone 12. The regular 64GB 12 is $800, so that's $100 (over 30 months) financed with just sales tax due upfront. In some places that's zero, but even in a higher 10% area that's $80. It's a hard sell to convince someone without a lot to drop $80 gambling in the stock market over replacing their 3 year old phone and getting a brand new iPhone that they get to enjoy immediately and only add, what, $3.33/mo to their cell bill."

2021-04-27 15:07:38,wallstreetbets,"How is this double taxation? To use the above example, no taxes were captured between 5-100 at any point. Do you pay tax on the inheritance somehow based on the current value at the time it is received at $100? Then again on the basis of 5-120, paying twice on the 5 to 100 gain? If not then I don't get it. My understanding is that you do not pay taxes until you realize a gain (i.e. sell the stock), not when receiving the inheritance so essentially, under the current system, the 5-100 gain is never captured."

Because you might be able to afford, say, $80 and an extra $3.33/mo on your bill, but not $880 all up front. But then on the flip side you'd tell anyone who paid $800 upfront that they're dumb for not taking advantage of 0% interest financing AND an extra $700 off the total. I just think the phone argument was not the best one to make.

In general, I don't fault lower class people for taking advantage of good deals like that, or say, owning a TV. Little ""luxuries"" like those don't change the circumstances they're in. Trust me, I visit these people in their homes every day with my job. That TV may be big, but it's a budget model for like $2-300 at Wal-Mart. Cell phones are typically whatever free crap Android phone they got at Metro or Boost, with some used, cracked iPhone held together with a cheap plastic screen protector and a flea market case, if they're lucky. Video games are usually whatever 1 or 2 gen old console and games they got at Goodwill.

Think about the flat tax.  If someone makes $20,000 a year gets taxed at 15%, and another making $200,000 a year taxed at 15% (total of $33k in taxes collected), who do you think will have a harder time with the cost of living?  The gradual tax where the 20k guy gets taxed at 10% while the 200k guy gets taxed at 20% (total of $42k in taxes collected), in retrospect, would allow the 20k guy to live a better life and at the same time take in more taxes than the flat tax method.

In any case, I think my statement about “lower clip” was ambiguous so allow me to clarify: each transaction yields benefits at a lower clip than if there were no taxes, not that transactions in general happen at a lower rate. Respectfully, a sales tax does not make retail transactions less appealing because the demand for certain products and services is inelastic. Have you ever thought “shit I really want this pair of shoes but the sales tax is just too much?” I definitely haven’t. I think sales taxes and income taxes are the most sensible type of tax and they are used in almost every high-functioning economy in the world. Sure there are exceptions such as Monaco, UAE, or the Bahamas, but those places have others means of generating revenue for the state that allows the enterprises and people to engage in their activities mostly unmolested."

2021-04-27 15:43:21,wallstreetbets,"So I looked it up. There is no federal inheritance tax. There are six states with an inheritance tax (unclear whether the stock would be taxed on inheritance or sale because I didn’t feel like looking it up) but it’s been settled for a long time that it is constitutional to pay both federal and state income taxes. 

This means that no tax would ever be paid on the amount of gains the deceased would have made had they sold the stock just before dying. This just captures the entire unrealized gain. 

As far as taxing money you’ve already paid income tax on, you only pay taxes on the gain, so if you buy 20k and sell the same stock for the same exact price, you don’t pay taxes again on your 20k. You pay taxes on the gain, which say the stock went up and your 20k is worth 30k now, you pay taxes on the 10k gain. That’s not double taxation, it’s a taxation on passive income. 

If you believe that passive income shouldn’t be taxed, then that’s fine and I’m sure there are arguments for it, but I don’t want to be disingenuous about throwing around the phrase “double taxation” just because something that wasn’t taxed in the past will potentially be taxed now."
2021-04-27 16:30:22,wallstreetbets,You're not really displaying a good grasp of how money works
2021-04-27 18:33:13,wallstreetbets,"Here ya go. The inheritance (estate in case of property) tax is paid on the value of assets inherited, doesn't matter if you sell it or not.

2021-04-27 18:15:14,wallstreetbets,"US has the highest immigration rate in the world, the current birth rate can't support our population. I doubt everyone would opt in having 5 children, the tax savings would go into supporting the kids, there is no net profit here."
2021-04-27 15:00:24,wallstreetbets,Why was that?
2021-04-27 15:55:45,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and? It's capital."
2021-04-27 13:35:46,wallstreetbets,"Lemme guess... you are a beginner with zero clue on macroeconomics? 

Lol. Highly concentrated money hurts your small 100k USD portfolio more than it benefits you."
2021-04-27 11:45:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sure lets just completely revert to a third world country. It's not like taxes pay for infrastructure, utilities or things that we may need like oh I don't know.. Universal Healthcare?"
2021-04-27 14:25:49,wallstreetbets,Actually the press secretary came out and said family over 400k and individuals over 200k.
2021-04-27 16:51:23,wallstreetbets,"How the government spends tax dollars is another issue altogether that doesn't have any bearing on this change.  If you didn't buy it, then what makes you think you have the right to a reduced cost basis?  If you inherit a car, you inherit the depreciation.  If you inherit a stock, you inherit the cost basis.  It's not an unreasonable rule.  Yes, it's kinda crappy for some people but...so the fuck what?  It's mainly going to affect more well-off people who can afford to do things like invest.  It will (ideally) benefit those who cannot.  You're getting free stocks.  Piss and moan and enjoy your free shit."
2021-04-27 16:29:52,wallstreetbets,"Fish live in water. 

The statement above is dead on accurate, and about as relevant to the conversation as double taxation."
2021-04-27 16:42:21,wallstreetbets,So they're taxing money because you earned money with taxed money. No way to make this at the very least not double taxation.
2021-04-27 16:34:44,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-04-27 17:28:18,wallstreetbets,"Yes that is double taxation, triple if you factor in the fact that you're paying both federal and state income taxes on your original earnings in most states."
2021-04-27 17:22:41,wallstreetbets,"Yes, yes it is. This is such a stupid statement."
2021-04-27 16:32:20,wallstreetbets,"Well, enlighten me, money genius."
2021-04-27 19:02:14,wallstreetbets,"I know. That has nothing to do with inheriting the stepped up basis.

If anything the estate tax will drop when they adjust it to only apply to the carryover basis instead of the stepped up basis, but even if they didn’t - nothing about the change from carryover basis to stepped up basis will change the taxes due at death."
2021-04-27 19:28:35,wallstreetbets,For people in the top tax bracket there is.
2021-04-27 15:58:51,wallstreetbets,"My parents bought their homes in the 90’s for under $100k each, and they’ve both skyrocketed to around $800k since. This is a similar situation for a lot of people in our neighborhood. Nearly all of us are middle class."
2021-04-27 13:53:09,wallstreetbets,Highly concentrated money as in if all 300M+ Americans kept all the money they earned to spend it how they want? It would still be circulating just on things we want for ourselves
2021-04-27 12:30:34,wallstreetbets,I don’t need universal healthcare I have great insurance I work hard to pay for. And I grew up on dirt trails I don’t need paved roads
2021-04-27 16:35:01,wallstreetbets,Not going to disagree about the relevance.  You are right.
2021-04-27 16:55:47,wallstreetbets,"It’s pretty simple. You pay taxes on new money. 

Earn 20 and pay taxes on it. Buy stock with that 20 then sell for 100. You owe taxes on 80.

How much money did you make? 100. How much did you pay taxes on? 100. At no point are you double taxed. This is pretty simple math, bust out the crayons."
2021-04-27 19:20:02,wallstreetbets,So are sales taxes unconstitutional?
2021-04-27 16:33:58,wallstreetbets,"Other people are trying, go read those and hit them up if you have questions"
2021-04-27 16:33:29,wallstreetbets,So your parents bought multiple homes when they were upper middle class and now they are wealthy 30 years later. What is your point? You are not middle class if you own 1.6 mil in property. What the fuck.
2021-04-27 13:55:56,wallstreetbets,I‘m not talking about your little pockets. And your little pockets aren‘t affected anyway lol
2021-04-27 14:34:58,wallstreetbets,I live in a country where everybody is insured automatically. I thought you ameritards might have learned something from the fact that binding your health insurance to your jobs isn't particularly good for people who get laid off due to a pandemic..
2021-04-27 13:14:34,wallstreetbets,How old are you? I hope it's late teens early 20s because anyone older than that should be more educated about what you're arguing for.
2021-04-27 17:17:13,wallstreetbets,"If you earn a $20 dollar bill (after taxes) today, and somehow it's worth $40 tomorrow, would you say it's ok to tax the the $20 increase in value?"
2021-04-27 19:42:41,wallstreetbets,Ask the SCOTUS.
2021-04-27 16:40:31,wallstreetbets,"Oh no, you decided to question my grasp, so take responsibility and show me what I'm wrong about."
2021-04-27 16:36:55,wallstreetbets,You know divorce is a thing too. Right? God this place is starting to smell like Reddit. Take this shit to r/LateStageCapitalism.
2021-04-27 16:51:53,wallstreetbets,"""I don't want to pay extra taxes if poors are getting a handout. I want to pay much more of my own money so that already wealthy middlemen can be handed another yacht""

\- My countrymen, smh"
2021-04-27 13:16:51,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a boomer to the bone. ""I pulled myself up by my bootstraps I expect everyone to do the same!"" despite decades of stagnant wages yet ever increasing tuition, housing and general cost of living. Funny enough this mentality is what sets us back financially. He doesn't need paved roads yet paved roads is how interstate commerce has been expedited allowing for greater market contributions, it's called building infrastructure for future returns. Looking at his post history he seems a bit odd."
2021-04-27 19:07:25,wallstreetbets,"No, of course not. But you're confusing an increase in purchasing power and a gain. An increase in purchasing power is not a gain. $20 will still be worth $20 regardless of what that money can purchase. 

Your $20 will never, ever, be worth $40 tomorrow. It will always, no matter what, be worth $20 if it sits in your wallet. What someone is willing to give you for $20 can change, but that is practically impossible to monitor (what is the basis, who decides what is worth what, how could this system reflect a global economy?) and could never realistically, nor should, be taxed. 

Now $20 dollars that I invest and get $40 dollars back for is a gain. 

I turned the $20 into stock. Then I sold that stock for $40. My money didn't turn from $20 to $40, I turned it into stock and resold it when the value of that stock changed. I earned income by risking my money in the market for a corporation to use and create value. I am only taxed on the increase in value, $20, as my principal investment has already been taxed presumably via income. Or not, via gift. Idk if you're trolling but your question here shows a straight up fundamental misunderstanding of what income is by confusing a gain vs. purchasing power increase. You also do not seem to understand that stocks are not money, they are an investment vehicle that can be sold to realize passive income and you are only taxed on the gain, not the entire value of the stock sale price."
2021-04-27 17:01:23,wallstreetbets,"Why do you keep bringing stuff up as if it was a valid argument? How the fuck does the concept of divorce change the validity of capital tax for wealthy people? Why do you keep responding if you're not interested in this discussion?

I can't find rich people larping as middle class on that sub."
2021-04-27 13:24:02,wallstreetbets,Nah I think hes just a kid regurgitating whatever bullshit hes been brought up to believe.
2021-04-27 17:04:45,wallstreetbets,"Because my parents divorced while the houses were still cheap, both lived in shitty apartments, and saved to each afford a cheap home. They’re lucky that they both lived in an area that exploded in value. I’m only responding because I’m dicking off at work, and I don’t see too many tankies here."
2021-04-27 13:40:58,wallstreetbets,Almost 30 been poor been upper middle class caught felonies been poor again and within 5 years I pulled myself up by my boot straps and bought a house in fucking Denver where it ain’t fucking cheap going to use the skills I’ve learned as a blue collar working class citizen to remodel and flip the house for easily 250k in profit. I’m hispanic with an immigrant mother a high school education with some college before catching the felonies so add violent criminal record to it and what do you have? A person that media and politicians swear the chips are stacked against in this country. And as great of a country it is it could be far better especially if taxes were far lower. I should keep what I make. I’m not for taxes period
2021-04-27 17:34:34,wallstreetbets,"My man, what you consider cheap is way out of most peoples financial reach. Can't you reflect on that? I'm not a fucking tankie because I take the left economic stance here.

Good on them for being very lucky, now pay tax on that financial luck like every person who experiences a similar kind of fortune. 

Although 1.6 mil in property isn't even enough IMO to levy some special rich people tax bracket for inheritance. I consider you wealthy, but not the toxic generational wealth type at all."
2021-04-27 13:54:00,wallstreetbets,"Your viewpoints are childish because you're uneducated. There's nothing wrong with that. I recommend you research why taxation exists. Its is not theft, it's the entry cost to live in a functioning society. If you think your life would be better off if taxes didnt exist you're wrong."
2021-04-27 13:58:23,wallstreetbets,I understand tax will never go away however it needs to be cut back like extremely cut back. Income tax wasn’t out in place until the early 1900s sales tax wasn’t put in until around the same time. Income tax needs to go period

Volume profile. Good volume at 18, 20, 21-23. Above 24 on good volume may carry it higher. 

Plus, keep in mind that MSFT got the Hololens contract. MVIS makes the projector system for it? They own the patents. They’re a good buyout candidate at their current price, because the Army’s contract will end up advancing consumer AR tech. MSFT has cash. They’re not gonna license it if they don’t have to, IMO

2021-04-27 12:47:37,wallstreetbets,"Best Joker ever!

May he rest in peace and didn't have to go through the Pandemic."
2021-04-27 12:55:57,wallstreetbets,Doubling down at 19 if it hits it
2021-04-27 13:01:16,wallstreetbets,Going to give it about a dollar more flex and then buy 50 more. I anticipate it going back up because yea... anyone selling before Thursday is not getting the point
2021-04-27 13:39:21,wallstreetbets,"Y’all are not apes, you’re RKT fgts. I bet “Its a good long term play” lmfao"
2021-04-27 14:26:54,wallstreetbets,Are we all staying still?
2021-04-27 14:35:03,wallstreetbets,"Highly unlikely MVIS is going back up any time soon. I hope I'm wrong because as it stands now I'm far into the red, but outside of irrational hope, I can't see any reason/justification for this company to be valued this high."
2021-04-27 15:21:20,wallstreetbets,Just bought 40 shares I hope for the best![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
2021-04-27 15:47:42,wallstreetbets,Just bought another 100 shares...🦍
2021-04-27 17:34:25,wallstreetbets,"Bought 200 at 19.95, holder on boysss. Together apes strong!"
2021-04-27 17:41:27,wallstreetbets,Tirering of the fight here come win with RIDE 24m shorts who have stopped fighting but haven't covered
2021-04-27 10:55:43,wallstreetbets,"This is a real company, not that you guys carw"
2021-04-27 11:00:35,wallstreetbets,"Oh, what’s that — is MVIS’ price inversely correlated to GME’s?

Is this because MVIS has been a HF-pushed distraction from GME the whole time?

Told you fuckers so. Suck a fat dick if you hold any MVIS. GME is the way."
2021-04-27 10:03:47,wallstreetbets,Go Go Go ! It's going to hit 20.
2021-04-27 10:23:23,wallstreetbets,Should I sell?
2021-04-27 10:24:05,wallstreetbets,I lost 20% in half an hour and got out. It's hitting below 20.  I wait until 18 and go in again.
2021-04-27 10:02:29,wallstreetbets,Gap fill at $18
2021-04-27 10:15:35,wallstreetbets,Told you Sndl

2021-04-27 10:04:15,wallstreetbets,😭
2021-04-27 10:54:56,wallstreetbets,What is the play here? I missed all of the DD on this.
2021-04-27 10:42:20,wallstreetbets,People need to remember WHY they bought in the first place... Highly anticipated conf call this Thursday. Anyone selling before then is a FOMO trader
2021-04-27 09:58:32,wallstreetbets,I like you
2021-04-27 11:33:52,wallstreetbets,I just bought some more.
2021-04-27 10:30:32,wallstreetbets,"I’m gonna discover a new solar system! Bought some more at the same, now averaging around 17-18 total. Only 74 shares tho 😄"
2021-04-27 11:20:51,wallstreetbets,buying is good choice!
2021-04-27 09:59:43,wallstreetbets,I bought more this morning at the dip
2021-04-27 09:58:43,wallstreetbets,I just did an hour and a half ago and feel pretty dumb now. Oh well FOMO was real. Again.

2021-04-27 10:22:59,wallstreetbets,Only if you have micro penis
2021-04-27 09:59:44,wallstreetbets,"Look at their earnings before listening to peeps online .
Trade it don’t invest it’s an absolute garbage company"
2021-04-27 10:16:52,wallstreetbets,"Nah you missed the boat, unless you want to hold for years in hopes it goes back up"
2021-04-27 10:39:51,wallstreetbets,Yes.
2021-04-27 11:14:12,wallstreetbets,Yes.
2021-04-27 12:04:22,wallstreetbets,Honestly I think it’s going lower before rocketing.
2021-04-27 09:52:28,wallstreetbets,"We are talking about the same stock, yeah?"
2021-04-27 09:53:45,wallstreetbets,GME
2021-04-27 09:53:44,wallstreetbets,"Why, what's happening on Thursday?"

2021-04-27 10:13:02,wallstreetbets,It’ll shoot back up. Do some DD. They moved their earnings call up to Thursday. Nothing but good signs.

2021-04-27 10:41:06,wallstreetbets,Why did you buy it? If the reason you bought it is sound and the fundamentals haven't changed then there is no reason to freak out
2021-04-27 10:24:49,wallstreetbets,Same mine is avg $26. I’m scared :(
2021-04-27 13:12:27,wallstreetbets,I  bought 276 shares at 23 and I'm a little shook but I'm just not going to look at it. I have confidence about Thursdays
2021-04-27 14:50:45,wallstreetbets,Thursday is the big day
2021-04-27 10:11:10,wallstreetbets,"We will be ok!! For real, just hold strong and dont waiver!!!"

2021-04-27 10:07:05,wallstreetbets,U gonna be holding for a while
2021-04-27 19:42:44,wallstreetbets,Lmfao. Yes keep holding or buy 840 more while it’s decreased in price so you can average down and come out the hole faster
2021-04-27 10:38:16,wallstreetbets,Me too.

2021-04-27 09:54:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah but it has no earnings. It's in growth phase. As long as the losses are smaller.

2021-04-27 10:30:18,wallstreetbets,Good time to get in on calls between $17 and $22 July or later…
2021-04-27 10:10:54,wallstreetbets,Same here.  Just think of it as a fire sale for new investors.
2021-04-27 11:40:48,wallstreetbets,Me too!
2021-04-27 12:42:00,wallstreetbets,Sounds good to me
2021-04-27 12:16:21,wallstreetbets,I should clarify that by tumble I mean I dropped from +800% to +400%. Only on WSB could I feel like being up 400% is losing money ha.

2021-04-27 11:11:15,wallstreetbets,"Bro stop it. When you get fomo from wsb buy near the money puts instead if the payback makes sense, to feed your gambling urges. the hype train launches the stock and it'll go back down to its normal level one the hype dies. Obviously this is psychiatric advise and not financial."
2021-04-27 09:59:10,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-04-27 10:13:40,wallstreetbets,I m only hoping you re right but it s taking its time.
2021-04-27 10:03:20,wallstreetbets,What’s the PT on this? How far out are we looking?
2021-04-27 10:36:34,wallstreetbets,"Lol ofc downvoted 11 times clowns

Now would be a good time to take a long with stop 21.5-22 if you want a trade.

Don’t listen to future baggies

Very nice, upvoted"
2021-04-27 10:28:28,wallstreetbets,"What?

edit: I misspoke. By “blowout” I should have said “positive news during the earnings report”. Their PE ratio is trash and will be for a while, unless they get a huge % of the MSFT deal. Haven’t dug into that aspect as far as when those proceeds would show up."
2021-04-27 10:31:40,wallstreetbets,"What is the probability they get bought out this month? It’s been rumored for a while. 

I haven’t played this stock since last year, so I’m behind on the news."

2021-04-27 10:52:24,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but I decided to take a profit now, and buy back in when it hits the floor... hopefully. I won’t be left sitting with bags for months like I am with GME"

2021-04-27 12:42:34,wallstreetbets,The best community in the world! I don’t know how I lived without it!
2021-04-27 12:34:45,wallstreetbets,Selling at a high and buying at lows is clearly irrational. If you aren't bagholding to the bottom are you even an ape?
2021-04-27 10:09:31,wallstreetbets,This is adorbs
2021-04-27 10:20:59,wallstreetbets,Same. I brought puts on MVIS when it was around $24 this time.
2021-04-27 16:14:47,wallstreetbets,"Or, you bought a great long term investment that will increase in value over the years as cannabis is legalized in more states and/or federally. Gotta think long term too, it's not all 500% gains"
2021-04-27 10:54:36,wallstreetbets,Any recent news on the weed stocks?
2021-04-27 11:08:05,wallstreetbets,Something about some critical part MVIS makes that is in a “Halo Lens” Microsoft is under contract to sell to the Army for billions so Microsoft is going to buy MVIS with a PT of 50-70$ is some of the chatter elsewhere. They also moved up earnings call apparently which is positive?
2021-04-27 10:21:34,wallstreetbets,"I would say, 0.01"
2021-04-27 09:56:22,wallstreetbets,"But that could make it crash. There are no earnings, it's in growth phase."

2021-04-27 10:21:48,wallstreetbets,Buying more now..

2021-04-27 13:03:27,wallstreetbets,Just close app for the day and be pleasantly surprised come thursday
2021-04-27 10:44:41,wallstreetbets,When they helped us crack the Nazis
2021-04-27 10:09:56,wallstreetbets,You still think it will go up?
2021-04-27 10:34:05,wallstreetbets,I still see it going to 30
2021-04-27 10:47:47,wallstreetbets,There's a massive partnership with Microsoft and a military contract coming. Thursday will bring an announcement that could potentially make the run up till now look like peanuts in comparison. Nevermind the short volume
2021-04-27 13:54:27,wallstreetbets,I still have my day job🤣
2021-04-27 10:24:38,wallstreetbets,Clearly I don’t know what I’m doing.
2021-04-27 10:33:39,wallstreetbets,"Lasers? Lasers! = Solid DD. 
I’ve hopped on board as well with the nice sale this morning. Pew Pew Pew!"
2021-04-27 10:30:15,wallstreetbets,Whew
2021-04-27 11:43:34,wallstreetbets,"At that level the premium seems relatively low in that price range already.  If you’re expecting the stock to go down, BOTH options and straight shares are not the best idea.  YES - my calls were bought between $11-$15 to allow more headroom for volatility.  Seems like the biggest risk is what happens if the market for the option dies down and the volume forces lag.."
2021-04-27 10:03:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, or is it too retarded?"
2021-04-27 10:59:08,wallstreetbets,Not sure it’s gonna do what you think it’s gonna do .
2021-04-27 13:32:53,wallstreetbets,"Wait, wait just a damn minute. You mean to tell me people sell and actually make money??? What a time to be alive man, wow"
2021-04-27 10:14:40,wallstreetbets,You can come too
2021-04-27 16:16:52,wallstreetbets,Definitely holding for the long term. I even averaged down on some of them. Now SNDL... that might be a lost cause.
2021-04-27 11:10:17,wallstreetbets,Yup...put it this way ... their tech was bought by Microsoft and the US army...you’re investing in some real shit
2021-04-27 10:25:04,wallstreetbets,1.01? Sounds like an intro to the moon class
2021-04-27 10:43:54,wallstreetbets,"Thursday is where they will announce the status and reception of their highly anticipated automotive LiDAR module demo to customers. Correct, no one actually cares about the revenue"
2021-04-27 14:49:14,wallstreetbets,"They brought the earnings report forwards, people don't do that with bad news and ""profound optimism"". Importantly they brought it into April, having previously stated that their lidar A sample will be completed ""within an April timeframe"""
2021-04-27 10:44:43,wallstreetbets,It’s not about the revenue or profit... This ENTIRE run is based on waiting for news of their automotive LiDAR demo and AR vertical. Anyone expecting financials info for Thursday hasn’t done any DD
2021-04-27 10:57:07,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands on Thursday 💎
2021-04-27 10:21:28,wallstreetbets,Fuck it
2021-04-27 13:06:21,wallstreetbets,That's the plan
2021-04-27 10:45:56,wallstreetbets,"As the old British saying goes:  British Brains, American Steel and Russian Blood."
2021-04-27 10:14:39,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely 💯.. Earning yes but the A sample lidar is the real catalyst for the 29th... Buy this dip and hold, you won't regret it in my personal 2 cents..."
2021-04-27 10:12:02,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, it will. Earnings aren't till the 29th.

Edit: Anyone who got in at 27. Wait for it to settle and average down."
2021-04-27 10:49:00,wallstreetbets,Siiick

2021-04-27 15:48:24,wallstreetbets,How was I able to buy 4 shares for every 3 I sold?  I love shares of MVIS not dollars
2021-04-27 10:16:37,wallstreetbets,Giggity
2021-04-27 16:25:01,wallstreetbets,"I didn't buy SNDL thankfully but I did get ACB, that was the first stock I bought though so only 4 shares bought at $11"
2021-04-27 11:14:03,wallstreetbets,It’s hard to believe that the Halo video game franchise has morphed into Army tech yet here we are.
2021-04-27 13:10:12,wallstreetbets,90% of this ape hive doesn’t understand this; thank you.
2021-04-27 15:51:57,wallstreetbets,"I don’t even know how to sell shares at all, just buy them, so you got me stumped on that one brothaman 🤷🏻‍♂️"
2021-04-27 13:49:19,wallstreetbets,I can finally check “having a threesome” off my bucket list *swoon*
2021-04-27 11:22:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah it’s crazy...they just really like Xbox ... I think it’s because Russia likes PlayStation
2021-04-27 15:53:34,wallstreetbets,I think you just drop your phone when the stock plows into the moon and u r good
2021-04-27 14:36:12,wallstreetbets,What if one of us had multiple personality disorder? Would this count as an orgy?
2021-04-27 16:07:38,wallstreetbets,O lordt I been doing it wrong thank you so much!
2021-04-27 15:07:21,wallstreetbets,Why is that even a question? Of *course* it would count!
2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,MNMD $3.2 million bought yesterday

2021-04-27 13:33:27,wallstreetbets,"Consider me a big noob who is just curious, how come most posts are people who bight the same stock, did everyone incidentally just come to the conclusion this company will bloom like that or was there a certain tip/advice given form someone here."

2021-04-27 09:55:05,wallstreetbets,There’s a halt my young ape. I bought before in the halt on fidelity
2021-04-27 15:22:01,wallstreetbets,"People bought MNMD because it was going to be listed on NASDAQ. It was traded on other exchanges before. Becoming listed on NASDAQ increases its visibility to institutional traders and is considered a catalyst.

It crashed afterward because of people taking profits. Buy the rumor, sell the news"

2021-04-27 10:24:12,wallstreetbets,It’s crashing Bc if the ones that bought shares  OTC under $1 are rich af now. It will take a Week to level out I’m hoping.
2021-04-27 17:54:14,wallstreetbets,It is now 💀
2021-04-27 15:23:01,wallstreetbets,"The stock the OP put $3.2 million in crashed below their avg basis. It's good you didn't buy it, unless you were going to buy the stock much earlier (it's usually already too late by the time something hits WSB front page) and then sell before it starts crashing"
2021-04-27 15:52:33,wallstreetbets,I think it's the other way around.

2021-04-27 19:38:38,wallstreetbets,Uhh what? You're literally on the same forum everyone else is. If you're late then it's just cause you're bad at trading.
2021-04-27 10:12:32,wallstreetbets,Thanks for verifying. good luck with your trade.

2021-04-27 12:21:24,wallstreetbets,With that kind of gain would it be best to yolo half of it back into the stock market anyway? Asking for a friend
2021-04-27 11:36:25,wallstreetbets,Either way this guy fucks
2021-04-27 19:03:03,wallstreetbets,When GME's highest otm strike for the week got released and went itm on the same day... GME saga was one hell of a feast.
2021-04-27 11:57:19,wallstreetbets,Too bad he isn’t generous to strangers!! 😉
2021-04-27 10:13:56,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, elder ape"
2021-04-27 15:24:31,wallstreetbets,"Thank you so much I appreciate your reply. ""buy the rumor sell the news"" that's a lovely saying
So it crashed because everyone who bought before closed their deals and now it's considered a bad idea to buy, but in general a good idea to sell... Have I interpreted your saying correctly?"
2021-04-27 15:23:21,wallstreetbets,Not holding for them to hit stage 3 news in the future? They've got three stage 2 studies cooking already.
2021-04-27 15:10:08,wallstreetbets,We can handle half cooked loss porn - common bro give me something to jerk myself too.
2021-04-27 11:50:57,wallstreetbets,Yup a lot of patient people with tens and hundreds of thousands shares who bought a loong time ago and didn't sell last ath.
2021-04-27 11:47:41,wallstreetbets,How can we make an OTC buy ?
2021-04-27 14:12:51,wallstreetbets,Think any ETFs will buy into MNMD?
2021-04-27 16:15:45,wallstreetbets,Ty for the answer
2021-04-27 18:20:04,wallstreetbets,No he can see it regardless
2021-04-27 12:40:41,wallstreetbets,Same here...hopefully I regret not buying more
2021-04-27 17:08:35,wallstreetbets,">Futu/Moomoo/GSX

can you give us some info about this? have a family member on webull and would like to be informed"
2021-04-27 12:26:39,wallstreetbets,"I mean if it was me I'd go $3-4m on a dream house, $1-2m on some toys, everything else in divadends and check out of life. 

At $10m+ I feel like you won the game...but that's just me. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️"
2021-04-27 15:39:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Some people didn't believe that it would continue to go up significantly, and cashed out the gains they made off the uplisting. Enough people did that to reduce the market sentiment and lower the bid price.

It *could* turn around and rise again, above its high today. Some people believe it will. I don't know enough about the company and I don't have any stake in it to make an opinion either way - I don't like the idea of investing in a business model that is both experimental and illegal and is unknown when it will become legal (psychedelics-based therapy)."
2021-04-27 11:48:22,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure it depends on your brokerage. I don’t really deal with otc or penny stocks.
2021-04-27 12:19:58,wallstreetbets,I use fidelity you have to open you account to OTC by telling them you understand the risk of the OTC market and then you're able to trade but not with margin
2021-04-27 13:01:59,wallstreetbets,What is OTC? (Trying to learn)

2021-04-27 12:37:00,wallstreetbets,"Holding 23K shares @.65 cost basis.  Sold principle a few months back, so this is all gravy/house money.   Very grateful, and fully aware this is probably my once in a lifetime investment like this.

Doesn't hurt that after quite a bit of reading, I'm totally convinced of future medical potential of psilocybin and/or derivatives.

It's going to take time (years), and I know a lot of people on here are not that patient, but almost no stocks/companies behave like GME, if you are looking for that.

There will also be setbacks I am sure.  Clinical trials are fraught with danger for investor money.  BUT....because of all that risk and uncertainty, tiny biotechs like this have a HUGE payout.  IF they make it (and VERY few do).

Good luck! Be careful!"

2021-04-27 10:28:03,wallstreetbets,"I've discussed this with a few therapist friends and this sentiment rings true amongst all of them. Many of them are long-term meditators. Even still, they believe in this mission, describing psilocybin (and other things) as the crash course to help patients understand their trauma and heal and many of them showed interest in one day incorporating this into their practice.  


Treating patients in a safe environment to help address anxiety and other serious issues and potentially untangle their suffering is truly an incredible mission. If we can pick up where the researchers left off in the 50s/60s and get behind MindMed to vet these treatments it will change the mental health space for the better.

Also: buy the dip  before you miss these 🚀🚀🚀🚀"

2021-04-27 11:29:32,wallstreetbets,"I mean Im not too sure, if I had to take a guess (not financial advice) I think it could go up to 7, 8 max. I think the hype will be short lived though and I can see it tanking down to 2.70 USD. Probably won't see significant movement outside of the Nasdaq hype for a year, this company is a long way away from any significant profit.   


That said, I will invest when the price tanks. I like what they're doing and think they have a lot of potential."

Mnmd has a relatively large float for their size, no profits, and an illegal product.

It'd be nice to know it's starting to become available in the U.S., but it's more likely that the few people who've said they microdose are from other countries."

2021-04-27 16:50:49,wallstreetbets,At high prices the difference between $1/share and $217/share is negligible. What really matter is # of shares you own

2021-04-27 16:04:56,wallstreetbets,They closed out and then likely have been reshorting as price continued to rise. For all we know they shorted heavy at $250 and are sitting on gravy right now.
2021-04-27 16:27:01,wallstreetbets,"Some pretty good DD stated it's somewhere between 114% of the float or up to about 900% .

2021-04-27 19:48:03,wallstreetbets,My upvote is for your mother.
2021-04-27 13:51:38,wallstreetbets,"Someone posted some DD on it a bit ago. The finer points were:

The share offering is not enough for shorts to cover their positions.

The offer price is much higher than what the short sale price was and so even if they bought ALL of it, they're still in the hole AND it won't be enough to cover."
2021-04-27 13:18:01,wallstreetbets,"That was a concern, which is why they did it gradually without announcing that it was happening. Hopefully it was all bought up by retail and existing stakeholders. It looked like shorts were just controlling the price as the stock was trading sideways for a while. If they were for some reason trying to limit the sqeeze or really capitalize on the squeeze price they could have held off and done this later so more shares were available to shorts as the price was shooting up. Since they did not do that and the price still held, it comes off looking very bullish for GME."
2021-04-27 13:15:27,wallstreetbets,"The higher the price, the less shares they need to sell to meet the fundraising target. With the price at this level..the amount of shares that can be issued won’t really create share dilution, and definitely won’t give enough to cover all outstanding short positions. If the did the offering at a price of $4.00 per share, that would be a different story. It’s a smart move by the King to raise capital without really hurting shareholders."
2021-04-27 16:21:36,wallstreetbets,"> should result in the stock reverting to a price in line with it's fundementals

that would be great if it did because the price should be a lot higher if that is true"
2021-04-27 15:17:16,wallstreetbets,"Having paid off their debts by issuing the shares, GameStop is now free to do things like introduce a one time dividend to shareholders, which would be very expensive for anyone shorting the stock"
2021-04-27 14:14:42,wallstreetbets,"In all honesty, don't expect serious advice in this sub. There's definitely people here who know what they're talking about and they might reply but mostly it's just people saying 🚀🦍💎. Which is fun, but do real, non-meme research too, so you don't lose a bunch of money."

2021-04-27 16:38:42,wallstreetbets,It's never going over $500. And I be surprised to see it go over $400.
2021-04-27 13:12:18,wallstreetbets,100k
2021-04-27 13:16:30,wallstreetbets,"Historically, stocks that have ""squeezed"" never reach their ATH again,  and might not even get close until years later.

Could it reach ATH? Possibly. Is it a guarantee? History says no."
2021-04-27 16:08:25,wallstreetbets,If history is any lesson around $480 before it falls apart. Although $350 is a more likely upside target.
2021-04-27 14:46:19,wallstreetbets,I’ve seen (without a squeeze) that if it has the same numbers as Chewy (based on market cap) then about $600. Then if you take that number and translate it into gaming sector then it would be in the low thousands.
2021-04-27 15:35:54,wallstreetbets,"I don't remember the exact numbers, but Uncle Bruce has said that even without a squeeze, assuming RC pulls off the transformation GME has the potential to trade at $500-$1,000 in a few years.  


Edit: He estimated that number on earnings multiples of comparable companies and the size of the gaming industry. It's all guesswork at this point though."
2021-04-27 15:22:28,wallstreetbets,10 Million is the floor for me gonna hold afterwards and see how far it'll go 🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-27 14:39:59,wallstreetbets,You need to look the other way about it. What is the lowest price that would make you know for sure the squeeze has happened? For me I'd say 50k. The PT is very personal though so everyone will have a different answer to this question depending on their own DD and tolerance to risk.
2021-04-27 13:27:06,wallstreetbets,$200?

Here is the whole interview tho. Easy to understand, def worth a watch"
2021-04-27 14:41:15,wallstreetbets,"They announced earlier this month that they were going to do this. The stock seemed to react negatively at that time. This news is that they completed the sale, raised $550M in cash and the stock price did not collapse, thus it was perceived as a bullish signal and the stock jumped."
2021-04-27 15:06:57,wallstreetbets,"well, fundamentals dont really work with gme. it probably went higher (and dropped back down from its AH price yesterday) because they have more money to clear their debt which was a concern before.

how this relates to its current stock price I really dont know. I still believe its price is reflecting the ""short squeeze"" potential and not its actual business."
2021-04-27 18:19:38,wallstreetbets,"They often give out GameStop exclusive Pokémon cards to customers, and also they are sort of a loss leader in Funko Pop (here in Canada most Funko are 8.99$ at Gamestop/EB compared to 13$ every where else).  

Also they are the most competitively priced for Yugioh, Magic and Pokémon cards from what I know.  Lots of reasons to buy your collectible merchandise here over say Walmart/ Target.

It’s very possible they can take a huge ammount of market share from Pokémon merchandise atleast.  That is just one segment I am sure there is many more."
2021-04-27 16:50:38,wallstreetbets,"An experience, and no I'm not joking."
2021-04-27 17:45:53,wallstreetbets,"Computer parts, collectibles, merch, funko pops...if you’ve been to a GameStop recently you’ll see"
2021-04-27 19:26:54,wallstreetbets,"What I want to know is what this even means that is different from what they currently do on their online store. Are they just pouring money into it to revamp the UI or actually going to offer anything worthwhile apart from . If they plan to become a key reseller like Fanatical or GMG, then maybe they have a good future potential. Are they competing with Walmart by expanding their store to sell food items like Mountain Dew and Doritos?"
2021-04-27 14:05:50,wallstreetbets,I've had pro on auto renewal for like 7 years now. I just like to have a magazine when I'm shitting and Game Informer hits all the right spots.
2021-04-27 17:47:36,wallstreetbets,"The Pro plan used to also give discounts on used games and bonus cash on trade-ins. Don't know if they still do that or not but depending how many games you buy/sell, it can definitely be a better deal than playstation store. Think it was a 10% discount/bump"

It's a meme stock."
2021-04-27 19:39:09,wallstreetbets,No resale value in digital. Gamers are an after-thought at the above retailers; whereas RC has the ability to deliver a gamer-centric and customer service centric powerhouse in a fast growing industry. Same reason why Best Buy and MicroCenters can coexist with Walmart
2021-04-27 17:38:18,wallstreetbets,"No one knows who has bought the shares, but it is likely longs as we've seen FTDs at $10 and $15 level, if they weren't covering then they're not covering at $150."
2021-04-27 16:29:32,wallstreetbets,"These shares have *already* been sold. The majority of them were likely bought up by retail over this past month of sideways trading. This is a very good sign, in my uneducated opinion."

2021-04-27 17:10:15,wallstreetbets,Have you been living under a rock since January lmao? You understand that they have a new ceo who is completely changing the entire business model of GameStop. No shit they have shit business practices all this hype is because they’re changing them

2021-04-27 16:36:52,wallstreetbets,I bought online from GameStop before I had the stock. Once I purchased the stock I started shopping at target. Maybe there’s something wrong with me.
2021-04-27 17:47:02,wallstreetbets,"Because they took the momentum from the market, pivoted to e-commerce, cut operations costs, added 1 day delivery, git a new C-suite with talent, paid off their debt, increased their balance sheet by a half billion through selling stock without the price going down, the free float (even with the market offering shares) is much smaller than we thought. Q1 has reported a 11% increase in earnings and online sales were up over 300% as of a few weeks ago. 

That's just easily verifiable stuff, things like actual short interest, retail ownership, FTD cycles and ect also add to a bull case, but require info not available to the public to verify."

2021-04-27 15:42:46,wallstreetbets,Selling shares makes the price of stocks go down. That's all they were saying.
2021-04-27 15:32:45,wallstreetbets,They were trickling them out so as not to tank the price but the volume has been so low lately it hasn't pushed the price as high as they would've liked. Remember they were allowed 3.5m up to 1 billion$. However getting more than half that is still a huge win for a company that was almost destitute a year ago!
2021-04-27 15:33:00,wallstreetbets,I believe they did it to avoid being accused of market manipulation.
2021-04-27 17:26:25,wallstreetbets,"When it’s not a paper trade, the last purchase price affects the next trade. Sell a bunch of shares and the price drops because supply of shares is beating demand. Stop selling and demand grows so price will go up.

2021-04-27 10:57:41,wallstreetbets,Lol at the people downvoting you for being smart. This isn't a team sport you clowns
2021-04-27 16:46:22,wallstreetbets,"You sell 1.5 shares = sub downvotes you into the dirt.  

GME sells 3.5 million shares = its a 1000000000 IQ play that could absolutely never help the shorts."
2021-04-27 13:33:45,wallstreetbets,Sorry about your downvotes but yes the plan is not to sell again ok?
2021-04-27 14:05:22,wallstreetbets,"You are at 69 down votes. Wish I could help, sorry"
2021-04-27 13:45:32,wallstreetbets,"Don’t get why you’re getting downvoted. I’ve cashed in at between $200-$350 and made a nice profit to start a portfolio. Also bought more shares after the price dipped from $350 to $40-$100 because I’d managed to cash half my holding at $350.

Seems like the only acceptable strategy is buy at $400 and hold..."
2021-04-27 17:54:41,wallstreetbets,I believe they're trying to kick start the internet Cafe scene in the US as well. Dunno how successful that will be.
2021-04-27 18:45:47,wallstreetbets,"They are shifting retail to online and turning the GameStop physical locations into regional tournament grounds with competition starting at the City, State, National and Global tournament rounds.

2021-04-27 15:00:53,wallstreetbets,How does this even get upvotes?
2021-04-27 13:25:29,wallstreetbets,You've gotta be fucking kidding me. Heard of $SONY or $MSFT or $NTDOY? Have you asked Amazon shareholders how they are feeling now that they're defeated?
2021-04-27 13:55:10,wallstreetbets,Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions. I hope you all make lots of money.
2021-04-27 17:26:55,wallstreetbets,"Also DFV bought 50,000 shares around that time and likely many apes followed suit buying more shares. The offering was sold on the open market so the shorts would have had to compete with apes for the shares."
2021-04-27 17:53:47,wallstreetbets,Which isn't really DD because there's literally no way to know the remaining short positions.
2021-04-27 14:09:42,wallstreetbets,Do you have a link to that DD by any chance?
2021-04-27 16:23:49,wallstreetbets,"I’m stupid, but the fact that they dumped 3.5 million more shares on to the market, and the price went sideways for a couple weeks, *to me* supports the idea that big players are doing just enough to keep wild swings from occurring.  On the other side however, these are professional traders.  They must have some end game other than to spend money keeping the price stable, hoping that retail gets bored."
2021-04-27 16:52:19,wallstreetbets,They sold the max amount of shares they were allowed to. Thst makes your comment about the high price purposeless...
2021-04-27 13:19:58,wallstreetbets,So what stops them from deciding they want to issue more shares?
2021-04-27 16:21:56,wallstreetbets,"dividends have to be supported by ongoing operating profit, I did not think GME was in that position."
2021-04-27 17:30:38,wallstreetbets,He's only in $140. There isn't a life changing or $ROPE amount of money to lose for him
2021-04-27 18:11:34,wallstreetbets,"He’s got one share, he’s probably not going to lose his house. Standard gambling rules apply: don’t bet more than you can afford to lose. And that’s why I have 5 shares in GME."
2021-04-27 17:20:57,wallstreetbets,Is there any reason it *wouldn't* achieve at least previous all-time highs? Like isn't it reasonable that shares would at least hit ~$400 each again once the squeeze occurs?
2021-04-27 14:38:46,wallstreetbets,NO ONE here can tell you how high it will go.
2021-04-27 18:12:08,wallstreetbets,"It’s a gamble, you shouldn’t be planning anything."
2021-04-27 13:40:54,wallstreetbets,At least 10 million per share. Gamestop will Eclipse the world economy during the squeeze.
2021-04-27 18:27:09,wallstreetbets,"1 or 2mil a share is DOABLE, there is enough money to cover that.  10 mil 100mil? No, there simply isnt enough money in the world to cover that.   That said, iv no idea how high ""infinite"" can go, i just know that at a certain point the USD will simply lose all its value and it wont matter if you had 1tril a share.   I will be exiting my position around 2mil a share.  Realistically though, 100k to 500k is probably where apes all bail."
2021-04-27 16:40:51,wallstreetbets,Lambo!
2021-04-27 16:47:51,wallstreetbets,Blew past it the first time
2021-04-27 18:06:24,wallstreetbets,"We'll see. Can't be too upset if my money only quadruples. 

You thinking shorts closed will be interesting to see. I wont come back here to check, but it really all depends on if the shorts did in fact close."
2021-04-27 17:27:29,wallstreetbets,It would have easily blown past $500 in January if they didn’t restrict buying. I would almost guarantee it hits $500 by the end of the year
2021-04-27 18:03:58,wallstreetbets,So you think brokers will restrict trading at 350 again?
2021-04-27 18:18:56,wallstreetbets,"That kind of makes sense.  The way they worded it implies that the stock went higher *because* of the offering itself, which of course makes no sense since a large sale would normally drive the price down."
2021-04-27 18:12:33,wallstreetbets,"Its actual business went from 300 ish mil on debt to a half billion in cash raised in just one month. 

Not saying that the current price doesnt include squeeze, but that the situation on the ground for GME has changed greatly as of this news."
2021-04-27 18:13:58,wallstreetbets,Its basically just a bunch of junk with some video games at this point lol
2021-04-27 18:23:09,wallstreetbets,"Who the fuck buys Funko Pops? I mean, what even are they? None of them look anything like the thing they’re supposed to me. It’s degrading."
2021-04-27 18:36:52,wallstreetbets,"Sure was, and I fear taking financial risks so damn much that I pussied out and didnt go all in, even though in the back of my mind I was saying do it."
2021-04-27 18:35:42,wallstreetbets,"Hey brother, there’s this thing, it’s kinda crazy, a thing called sarcasm. Best of luck in life 👍🏻"
2021-04-27 16:34:28,wallstreetbets,Ahh ok. See you on the moon! ( for a pit stop anyway ) 🦍
2021-04-27 16:02:30,wallstreetbets,"Nah, I simply see that they have zero debt now, and are transitioning into an e-commerce company."
2021-04-27 16:03:29,wallstreetbets,Ryan Cohen already beat Amazon at its own game and created a multi billion dollar company from nothing without using any of Amazon’s shipping infrastructure. He’s doing the same thing currently with GameStop. Name another company that does same day free shipping on orders over $25 🥶
2021-04-27 15:24:57,wallstreetbets,They all will PT at $30 cause they base it on fundamentals. Everyone knows GME does not follow those!
2021-04-27 17:53:14,wallstreetbets,Lol that’s not true at all TSLA did 30 million MSFT did 30 million AAPL did 65 million and that’s just the first couple I looked at
2021-04-27 18:48:23,wallstreetbets,The problem with that thesis is that we have seen gme trade at 30 or 40 million at a similar price point
2021-04-27 17:21:12,wallstreetbets,... please. Let the shit company go out of business. A new better one will rise from its ashes. Fool me once man... fool me once.

2021-04-27 19:48:10,wallstreetbets,It's been 3 months and many paychecks since. More likely they're too traumatized to buy the dip even when every price point since January is a dip to them.

2021-04-27 13:48:33,wallstreetbets,I was thinking that GME was the same thing as beating up on Vlad...

2021-04-27 17:52:05,wallstreetbets,"Naw, just diversifying your portfolio. Now when you buy Target stock you can start shopping at GameStop."
2021-04-27 17:57:46,wallstreetbets,None of which explain why anyone would consider GME a value stock right now.

2021-04-27 18:38:33,wallstreetbets,With 4 shares? By house in your city do you mean a refrigerator box in an alley?
2021-04-27 13:12:25,wallstreetbets,No. There is literally no way to know. Everyone wants to know and there is plenty of DD speculating about the short positions but there is only limited info available from FINRA.
2021-04-27 13:59:11,wallstreetbets,"Only thing we know for sure, if you added up all the institutional ownership prior to the release of new shares, it came out to something like 140 million shares. Well above the float. And that doesn't account for insiders or smaller players, like individual retailers and any stock they own.

So, a lot of open shorts."
2021-04-27 13:17:34,wallstreetbets,They use deep itm options so there is not a really way to know but imo they are deeeeeeeeep in the mud.

2021-04-27 18:14:04,wallstreetbets,"This is the answer. GME had a solid case. They have no control over the stock price, fundamentals don’t matter, AND they didn’t benefit from the squeeze. 

They can 100% say they did what they thought was best fundamentally for the company regardless of their stock price. Which is true."
2021-04-27 18:55:39,wallstreetbets,"It's not market manipulation to issue new stock, what are you talking about?"
2021-04-27 14:04:42,wallstreetbets,I think they are being downvoted due to “high likelihood of bot.”  See user history.
2021-04-27 12:10:10,wallstreetbets,I've been buying and selling making a killing on GME. I thought we were here to make money not tickle each other's buttholes.

2021-04-27 14:06:42,wallstreetbets,That probably explains the wide price movement with thin volumes.

But you could say that about pet products and look what happened with chewy. Who was at the helm of that company again? I think it was some guy named Ryan Cohen. I heard he is working with GameStop now."
2021-04-27 18:12:54,wallstreetbets,This is still a super bias DD though. There is enough volume for shorts to cover most days of the week. They literally have no idea if shorts have covered but they say it like it's gospel.

2021-04-27 13:25:40,wallstreetbets,"They have to authorize them ahead of time. They already issued everything they had previously authorized and have plenty of cash reserves, so no need to authorize more."
2021-04-27 14:02:42,wallstreetbets,"Like u/Diznavis says, the Board of Directors would have to pre-approve another dollar amount or # of shares to go through with another bout of raising capital. This scenario unlikely at this time and they don’t have any more pre-approved raises after this one."

2021-04-27 15:18:29,wallstreetbets,Is there no way to ballpark a realistic estimate?
2021-04-27 14:10:44,wallstreetbets,Lol I personally feel we would all be extremely lucky to get it to $300.
2021-04-27 17:09:24,wallstreetbets,Eh hit 480 after hours and then crashed isn't really blowing past it.
2021-04-27 17:35:03,wallstreetbets,While I agree that it would have happened in Jan I just don't think it's going to happen again. I think a lot of people closed their positions during and after the crash.  Also what makes you think they wont restrict buying again if it does start to squeeze?
2021-04-27 18:39:54,wallstreetbets,The massive Funko Pop store outside my apartment on Hollywood Blvd with a line around the block everyday tells me that a lot of fucking people buy and collect them.

The company is the exact same as before, same fundamentals, same low profitability, etc. A shift to ecommerce may help, but these things take years, I’m talking 5-10 years to see a change in profitability. It’s how companies work. Magic doesnt happen overnight."

2021-04-27 19:58:27,wallstreetbets,Yeah we have no idea what their situation is. Maybe they took out a line of credit and their paychecks are going towards paying that off instead of throwing more into GME because no one has any idea how long they can delay the squeeze for. I'm sure anybody who can afford to average down does it every chance they get. Lots of apes are averaging up.

New data will come out around mid-May and we will see how the big institutions have played this from Jan-March. Anyone that has reported early (only 2-3 brokers) have sold some of their shares but looks like they are still holding quite a bit more.

2021-04-27 13:49:14,wallstreetbets,"And how would you know that they use deep ITM options to hide position, other than the pure speculation on Reddit of course."
2021-04-27 19:21:47,wallstreetbets,"Given the events surrounding gamestop, they could 100% be accused of market manipulation. They are playing it safe."
2021-04-27 17:08:43,wallstreetbets,"Considering the comment chains also going on from my last comment, I actually have no idea what's going on with the consensus. Reddit's just being Reddit, I guess."

Downvoted for asking a question. Stay classy Reddit."

2021-04-27 13:49:49,wallstreetbets,Tbh a lot of the downvotes may just be coming from the “Thank You Robinhood!” line as much as anything
2021-04-27 16:23:46,wallstreetbets,Good on you. I tried playing the dip once. Sold at the literal bottom. Showed me I don't know what I'm doing.

2021-04-27 13:08:45,wallstreetbets,Calling the stock market a casino is an offense to casinos. Casinos are actually regulated.

2021-04-27 17:13:01,wallstreetbets,"What does GameStop currently sell that Walmart/BestBuy and others don't? Serious question, I don't live in the US anymore and haven't been to a gamestop for 15 years. As far as I know the only advantage they have is buying back your games/consoles for pennies on the dollar, and selling used games"
2021-04-27 17:28:30,wallstreetbets,"Amazon. Ebay, best buy, walmart, target, microcenter,  and on and on and on and on. 

Remember you would have been ridiculed nonstop if you admitted to shopping at gamestop before people thought they could get rich from them. 

They were the butt of jokes on reddit for years. People constantly talked shit about them

You notice everyone says they like the stock? Its because they don't like the store, they like the thought of being a millionaire (not gonna happen for 99.999999999% of investors)"
2021-04-27 16:27:06,wallstreetbets,What? There are countless of players on the gaming related market segment and it is quite spread out. They are not the only one.
2021-04-27 18:00:50,wallstreetbets,Newegg and Amazon
2021-04-27 18:04:46,wallstreetbets,"> I think you're missing the point here lol. Where do you buy gaming related stuff? GameStop. Where else? Nowhere. Sure, you can buy stuff on amazon if you want. But you could say that about pet products and look what happened with chewy. Who was at the helm of that company again? I think it was some guy named Ryan Cohen. I heard he is working with GameStop now. 

Like everyone else here said Walmart, Bestbuy, Amazon, Target, Ebay, Microcenter and countless others.

Let me tell you why Chewy was special: People want to vet (no pun intended) goods that their pets put in their mouth. Chewy vets their products and is a trusted name... Amazon has issues with third party sellers and their quality.

This is a non-issue in the gaming market. It's that simple."

2021-04-27 19:17:51,wallstreetbets,Their compensation is gonna be in shares in the future. Is one of the Ryan Cohen changes so the board actually does its job.
2021-04-27 13:32:55,wallstreetbets,"So again, this indicates to me that the stock should revert to a valuation based on it's fundamentals. Now that valuation should have increased based on the increased name recognition, increased public interest in whatever online business they try to establish and the fact that they are now flush with cash. But even if they use those things to build something to rival Steam, it seems a pretty crowded business space. 

Anyway, good luck to you all, I just hate to see the little guy end up holding the bag and it looks to me like that is where this ends."
2021-04-27 18:24:50,wallstreetbets,"Yes yes, those trading halts were just the squeezing squozing and ending. Right?"
2021-04-27 18:00:47,wallstreetbets,"Because the information to confirm what you are saying is not publically available, or contradictory to the indicators we have. 

Other ideas for the increase have been thrown out, but until we get the number of existent shares from the upcoming vote, your guess is a fine one but just a guess."
2021-04-27 19:19:36,wallstreetbets,"Except, it's still the most shorted stock:

https://www.tradersinsight.news/traders-insight/securities/securities-lending/securities-lending-report-4-19-21-4-23-21/"
2021-04-27 15:40:37,wallstreetbets,This would imply that the market would be rational.
2021-04-27 16:01:54,wallstreetbets,"There isn’t.  As the other chap mentioned GME doesn’t follow standard rational stock movements and nobody knows the real number of real shares vs. shorts.  Any numbers you see posted are purely theoretical.  Hold your shares and see what happens, it’s as simple as that.  Based on current moves the long term value of the stock looks good even without a squeeze."
2021-04-27 15:52:01,wallstreetbets,"Nope, anyone telling you other wise is lying and pushing some agenda. You would have to obtain data on size of short position that actually exists, something at most a few dozen people on this planet have access to.  And you would have to probe the minds of every single retail investor and run that data through a supercomputer so powerful that nothing like it will exist for at least a few hundred years.  Then run simulations to determine what the most likely scenario is to occur, and what price every retail trader would exit at.   
Any math that gets done relating to money, the economy and every in between at some fundamental level operates of the principles of supply and demand.  And for those to hold, one must assume rationality from both consumers and suppliers.   
There is NOTHING rational about HFS doubling down on a losing bet and for a cult like attitude that boils down to buy at any price and hold.  
Again, unless you can obtain the 3 things I mentioned above (short data, mind reading device and super computer) any attempt at a prediction is massively misleading at worse and a huge waste of fucking time at best."
2021-04-27 16:11:50,wallstreetbets,If there were it would be there already
2021-04-27 17:56:55,wallstreetbets,Sure. It will be more. Or possibly less. Perhaps even the same.
2021-04-27 17:44:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm concerned that you have triple digit shares and don't know the answer to that question

Unless you mean you bought in at triple digits, not own a triple digit number of shares"
2021-04-27 14:12:15,wallstreetbets,Good thing short interest doesn’t care about your personal feelings
2021-04-27 18:09:26,wallstreetbets,Let's be clear. It didn't crash. Robinhood crashed it.
2021-04-27 18:03:29,wallstreetbets,"It only crashed because RH restricted buying. They (can't remember who, but a Wall St person) said to congress it could have hit 1k if that didn't happen"
2021-04-27 17:11:19,wallstreetbets,"So it didn’t tank at 420 then Jesus Christ, and we all know why it stopped."
2021-04-27 17:42:59,wallstreetbets,Because everyone (all the smart people at least) got out of the brokerages that restricted trading ie Robinhood mostly. Now anyone who’s smart about GameStop has all of their shares with Fidelity or someone else that didn’t restrict trading because they have enough capital.
2021-04-27 18:41:29,wallstreetbets,I might open an old rope shop next door.
2021-04-27 16:14:09,wallstreetbets,Tell that to the dude who managed to take 300mil debt and turn it into a 500mil surplus of cash for his company without tanking share prices 😂
2021-04-27 17:30:05,wallstreetbets,At least you’re honest about it. The guy above you is acting like mother Teresa works there. I give you a gold star sticker.
2021-04-27 18:12:20,wallstreetbets,"But are you making cash? Like you’ve sold it and have spent gains elsewhere? Most of what I see in the thread is retard cheering for mostly sideways movement, and people begging to be picked up at the $300+ level."

2021-04-27 18:01:12,wallstreetbets,"Simple, just sell half your stock and repurchase at 40. Duh."
2021-04-27 18:09:15,wallstreetbets,"I feel like a gigantic doofus for not buying 2-5 shares when it tanked. I'm only in for 5 shares at 205 (now) so that would have helped a ton.

Edit: In all honesty I was not trying to put more money into a stock that just lost me ~$1500 which is far and away the most I've ever lost on stocks."
2021-04-27 19:07:08,wallstreetbets,I was in at $290 but was able to average down to $245.
2021-04-27 12:34:14,wallstreetbets,That had to sting at first
2021-04-27 13:45:17,wallstreetbets,"Man...I bought at $257 before it dropped.  I wish I had averaged down!  But, it's all good.  The baby is growing up again."

2021-04-27 14:54:03,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t downvote them or call them a bot.  I just suggested a different reason as to why they were being down voted.  

It’s one thing to say you made money selling gme, it’s another thing to only say and to have ever said that you made money selling gme.  This sub has a (supposed) history of bots encouraging the sale of gme.  That’s probably why he’s being downvoted."
2021-04-27 13:53:02,wallstreetbets,"Well, it was meant to be a dark joke.. Trust me, I was as pissed as anyone back then. But I believe I've done the best thing I could for myself and for the squeeze, considering the situation."
2021-04-27 16:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Well, after RH and others blocked buying and price started going down rather fast it wasn’t rocket science that we’re not going higher any time soon, that’s when I sold 2/3 of my shares. Kept the 1/3 just in case. Started buying on the way down. Because of fomo and I believed the story was not over. My average was 53 after I was done so I’m pretty happy with that, but I was really stressing when it kept falling and falling. Average is higher now though, bought more after last dfv update."
2021-04-27 12:45:56,wallstreetbets,people who understand that you don't make money in a casino..... you go to the casino to pay money to indulge in the fantasy of maybe (but not realy) making money

I was responding to you because it seems like AlabamaGroyper is a bot.  40 day old account, 0 karma and first comment is about selling GmE seems sus.  I wasn’t calling you a bot, but Jesus no need to defend yourself like that.  I don’t give a flying fuck about your past comments.  I know we call each other retards around here, but calling me that in a derogatory manner isn’t really okay.

I thought apes respected each other in this sub."
2021-04-27 18:38:46,wallstreetbets,"I have a mall close by that has a lot of traffic even throughout covid. I could seen a scene popping up here mayyyyybe but its still seems like a long shot imo. It could be kinda cool for kids if it was geared toward them, but as an adult gamer I think there's going to be a way bigger void for esports lounge, pub-stomp, bar type places. The US is just very spread out and has internet infrastructure in most places. It's hard for the Cafe scene to pop off like it has in places like SE Asia."
2021-04-27 17:12:48,wallstreetbets,Valve has to be worth some absolute mind-boggling numbers. I want to see GameStop buy Valve.
2021-04-27 16:28:41,wallstreetbets,What other store fills the same role as GameStop?
2021-04-27 19:56:55,wallstreetbets,Imo you should buy the dip and hold or you'll regret it for the rest of your life
2021-04-27 18:11:43,wallstreetbets,"True, even the info was available, I doubt they would reveal to the public the real ammount of shorts to prevent another Reddit mania squeeze from happening again."
2021-04-27 17:51:52,wallstreetbets,"Don’t be, I understand and accept the risk, plus I was in very early. But my point is that upon individual research, I also use discussion boards and online communities to gauge my DD; but with GME, the only places I can find discussion on the topic are generally meme communities where you have to sift through hundreds of the same meme comment to get even a little actual analysis. Most everything else that’s more serious about investing is actively avoiding discussing GME.

I’ll be the first to admit that I don’t know everything when it comes to stocks, so I was just simply wondering if a smarter ape could ballpark an estimate for where we’re headed. Either way I’m in a pretty comfortable spot, I either get rich from the squeeze or I hold a long position in GME during their pivot and then most likely come out the other end with a nice gain."
2021-04-27 14:16:46,wallstreetbets,"Right? $300??!! This went to $500 on gamma and retail alone lmfaoooooo

2021-04-27 16:43:59,wallstreetbets,I bought 30 at $43 the Friday it started mooning in January. Sold after earnings at $140 and then fomo'd with 10 at $200. I made money and it allowed me to buy some other stock so can't complain.

But all signs point to who the fuck knows. If everyone holds, the price will literally just keep climbing and the ""100k"" posts wouldn't be wrong, but there are too many factors to account for and too many things that could change. Personally I'm betting that whales start cashing out around 5k if this squeezes and that'll slow the roll pretty significantly"

2021-04-27 14:18:46,wallstreetbets,"Yeah so a bunch of fake synthetic shares exist created by rehypothecation  (shorts use shares they don’t own to hedge other bets) and shorts haven’t closed any of their positions. Short interest is over 100% according to GMEs own SEC filings which means shorts have to at least buy every single share in existence once, possibly up to ten times even. Basically hold on the way up for the squeeze and sell on the way down."

Ryan Cohen, in around a month, liquidated ~3.5 million shares into the market slowly as to not crash the share price and help retail, and then used those funds to pay off all debt and create a cash pool of over $500 million for the company to use however they want. Not to mention an increase in online sales this year by over 190%. It’s cool you just shit on GameStop without looking at the actual company’s practices"

But if they did that the 30% wouldn't see the top of the peak that was theoretically possible, and the 70% would be bag holders. If instead everybody holds until after the peak far more people will sell for a much higher profit. It's not a group activity, neither is the prisoner's dilemma.

Short interest reduced by 85% of the float (130% to 45%) between 15th Jan and the 29th Jan. What happened during this period? Oh yeah the start of the squeeze, followed by Citadel halting trading, followed by the price crashing into the 100s and rebounding back to 350 before crashing again.

So it’s not a wild shot to say that those large price increases, both before trading was halted and when it rebounded from $120 to $350 again, could have been caused by a large number of shorts covering.

Everyone believed the reported short interest figures when they were 130% but no one wants to believe them now, even though there has been plenty of opportunity for shorts to escape their obviously doomed positions."

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"COVID's Massive Effect on the Semi-Conductor Market: What This Means for Electronics Manufacturers on Earnings Week  Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. 

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. 

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.   
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. 

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. 

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector."

&#x200B;

Sup, apemeisters! Take a look at some of the technical observations that I've made. So, what you may see on the picture above is the 1-2-3-4-5 impulsive wave, which I structured through the $SPY uptrend starting late March last year. The mark-up phase of the cycle seems to be approaching its apex, or potentially has done so. significant factor playing in support of that proposition, is that Fibo retracement applied to the chart fits perfectly well: wave 1 hits 78.6% and the correction follows; wave 3 plays with 61.8%, 50% and morphes into wave 4 just above 38.2 Fibo; while wave 5 is held back by 23.6% during the considerable period of time.

The forecasted A-B-C has sort of conservative estimates applied to it (see below chart for comparison). 150 is viewed as the most magnetizing spot for A-B-C to land on, coupled with the buffer zone between 50% and 61.8%.

&#x200B;

[$SPY 2016-2020 cycle, weekly chart.](https://preview.redd.it/n7ut1zjp0pv61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcfc3ed22e993db0f754f025dc6b851ab56e80d7)

&#x200B;

The above chart is given for comparison, and the corrective A-B-C wave is just brutal here. Сonsequentially, similar scenario is what you should also 🐻 in mind. Namely, 78.6% may play as a honey pot for bears, and everyone knows that when a bear anticipates honey you shall not get in his way.

2021-04-27 07:00:42,wallstreetbets,"The chance of you being right is not 0... but it's just random, and would have nothing do to with this analysis even if it happened."
2021-04-27 08:16:52,wallstreetbets,It’s all relevant though
2021-04-27 09:54:56,wallstreetbets,"Now we also got Nostradamus here, that can see into the future :)"
2021-04-27 07:21:07,wallstreetbets,Didn’t he steal from TSLA or something like that?
2021-04-27 09:08:36,wallstreetbets,The only awakening you'll be doing is figuring out why you always stare fondly at doorknobs.
2021-04-27 10:06:49,wallstreetbets,"And the market doesn't care about your technicals.

It's no better than astrology. This is why we call it crayon lines and mock you, because they mean nothing."
2021-04-27 07:33:48,wallstreetbets,Post approved... Thanks for the TA post!
2021-04-27 09:18:43,wallstreetbets,Weird right! I’m so glad someone else noticed
2021-04-27 08:08:43,wallstreetbets,Anything above the eyebrows homie
2021-04-27 08:48:34,wallstreetbets,🌈🐻
2021-04-27 14:43:12,wallstreetbets,Where the fuck do you all find the time to put together these massive DDs? I can barely keep up with my day to day shit before it's time to hit the sack.
2021-04-27 09:27:11,wallstreetbets,Let's hope.
2021-04-27 09:16:21,wallstreetbets,Corrections are necessary for buying dips and winning tendies (?)
2021-04-27 13:26:00,wallstreetbets,Not while I have have MVIS 50C
2021-04-27 09:22:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sure nobody has ever made sound deductions about a stock and made money from technical analysis, it’s all just tea leaves!

The last 100 years of stock trading would like a word with you"
2021-04-27 08:17:01,wallstreetbets,I recognize real heroes when I see them.
2021-04-27 07:39:07,wallstreetbets,Still not visible(
2021-04-27 09:20:14,wallstreetbets,Yea I think it will be going down until Tomorrow or Thursday the latest I think
2021-04-27 09:22:51,wallstreetbets,Yea and the reason why I think so is because of the major tech stock earnings this week like Microsoft and Tesla etc
2021-04-27 09:24:02,wallstreetbets,I think it will touch 420 and probably ride sideways for a day or 2 after that...now after riding sideways I have no clue lol
2021-04-27 14:49:12,wallstreetbets,That’s my secret. I’m always DDing.
2021-04-27 15:03:20,wallstreetbets,Gonny cry 2?
2021-04-27 09:51:25,wallstreetbets,"Either it works constistently or not... Could you make a 100% certain choice based on that? No? Then it is ""tea leaves""!"
2021-04-27 16:30:33,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they get it right 50 per cent of the times."
2021-04-27 09:21:58,wallstreetbets,So your thinking another actual correction early this week and then it should be able to March up and break that 418 resistance?
2021-04-27 09:26:03,wallstreetbets,Right and that spy lately for you! Lol
2021-04-27 15:05:44,wallstreetbets,I just don't know when I can find time to do that... And that makes me sad because I find all this so interesting.
2021-04-27 09:53:00,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately you’re wrong on this one. Take the weather forecast for example. According to your logic if it’s not accurate 100% of the time and we can’t predict if we should wear shorts or a rain coat, the whole system is flawed and we just shouldn’t try to predict the weather, right?"
2021-04-27 15:07:03,wallstreetbets,Just enjoy it then. Every DDog has its day)
2021-04-27 09:57:01,wallstreetbets,"If people were trying to predict the weather based only on the temperatures and weather conditions in the last year, yes it would still be mostly flawed."
2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Congrats to everyone that decided to join the MVIS team! I've been with them for a while and will continue to hold, and I hope you will too! Trust me, this is not over. If you hesitated to buy in the past, it's not too late. Join the MVIS club! "
2021-04-27 09:13:28,wallstreetbets,"I'm down. I put in $600, not much but it's what I've got. Wish me luck 🙏😅"
2021-04-27 06:43:38,wallstreetbets,"At 80 shares now, made 600 yesterday today not So bullish for now. But ill diamond this"
2021-04-27 09:16:00,wallstreetbets,"Seeing comments like ""how did u find dis"" makes me realize how WSB has been beaten to death. 

Nice gains tho."
2021-04-27 06:47:30,wallstreetbets,"I bought in a few months ago through. In the Microvision sub there are hardcore OG diamond hands that have been holding this stock since 1999!
I bet that's longer than some of us apes have been alive 😂"
2021-04-27 08:45:34,wallstreetbets,Looks like we’re gonna get a discount at open
2021-04-27 06:59:47,wallstreetbets,"Just got in yesterday.
Wow."

2021-04-27 06:46:49,wallstreetbets,First topic I read on after joining WSB was MVIS. Hopped on with 78 shares at 13$ a pop. Up over 100%. In it to win it!! First stock ever purchased and I’m already In the green.
2021-04-27 08:11:02,wallstreetbets,Dropping hard right now
2021-04-27 08:18:13,wallstreetbets,"We are dipping, wtffff let’s go!!"
2021-04-27 08:49:56,wallstreetbets,Bought yesterday buying more today.  MVIS moonshot

2021-04-27 07:10:59,wallstreetbets,"hell yeah, in with 1000 shares"
2021-04-27 07:28:24,wallstreetbets,How did u find out about this stock?
2021-04-27 07:37:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm all in for 10k.  I like the stock. Hope people continue to buy, I know I am."
2021-04-27 07:09:47,wallstreetbets,I got in at $16 and I hate myself for not buying $20 options that were still cheap at the time!
2021-04-27 12:15:38,wallstreetbets,And this friends is how you lose money
2021-04-27 06:46:33,wallstreetbets,"Just joining. Hope you guys don't leave me joining in just to hold the bag. Going to trust the team and hope I don't get screwed, lol. 

Throwing money in and hoping I wasn't too late and it backfires on me, cause that seems to be my luck these days. 

Ready to go!"
2021-04-27 07:52:12,wallstreetbets,"So wait until market opens, buy my shares and wait? Thinking of 50-75 shares(looks like 28-30) first stock ever so I'm just kinda following along."
2021-04-27 07:59:02,wallstreetbets,"Maaaaaannnnnnnnnn I didn’t know you guys were on this stock! I had some 11$ calls and made like 3k, sold some and then the next day it tanked. That was like a few weeks ago so I did the same thing except I bought some puts this time thinking it would drop again but noooo that fcker goes to 29! 😂 Thank you Reddit, very cool!"
2021-04-27 09:20:19,wallstreetbets,"In at 10.39. stop loss today at 26. 

You boys keep it going but I'm taking my 160% if need be.


EDIT: good call me"
2021-04-27 07:40:47,wallstreetbets,"HOLD IT, I’M IN WITH MY RICH BOI 110 SHARES @ avg 18.08$"
2021-04-27 08:32:46,wallstreetbets,It's down 10% now :(
2021-04-27 08:37:44,wallstreetbets,I think there's more buyers than sellers. Some folks getttin some at a lil premarket dip i think.
2021-04-27 10:05:12,wallstreetbets,Just bought in! Don't have too much money to use but could afford 20 shares :)
2021-04-27 10:17:14,wallstreetbets,I lost around 17% but i will keep holding
2021-04-27 10:29:53,wallstreetbets,Added some more $MVIS during their last dip and I've made some decent profits already. Going to continue to hold for a while.
2021-04-27 10:37:20,wallstreetbets,Hold
2021-04-27 14:30:46,wallstreetbets,I'm but a poor boy but I bought a single share just now so we'll see...
2021-04-27 10:15:31,wallstreetbets,Will it bounce back today?
2021-04-27 06:58:26,wallstreetbets,Today would be a very scary day to invest but I'm seeing a lot of support. Maybe I'll throw a G into it and see what happens. Good luck to all
2021-04-27 08:40:04,wallstreetbets,Just got in last night at 28.72🤞🤞✌️
2021-04-27 08:21:58,wallstreetbets,Is this the next rocket stonk?
2021-04-27 11:52:55,wallstreetbets,"Can't wait for the dump so I can laugh for the hundredth time already. This isn't gamestop, there will be no gamestop ever again. I will come back to this post to remind you. It's only a matter of time."
2021-04-27 07:20:18,wallstreetbets,In with way too many shares ... Closed out yesterday with $3k profit (wasn’t a believer quite yet!) ... back in later in the day ... hope today rallies again!!
2021-04-27 06:47:27,wallstreetbets,I wanted to buy in when it was $13 but I have positions stuck in other stocks. I'm thinking about selling my other positions at a loss and buying into MVIS now. Wonder if it's too late?
2021-04-27 10:41:43,wallstreetbets,Don't sell. You'll regret it.
2021-04-27 07:27:59,wallstreetbets,Got in at 100 shares at $1.2 should I get out ? Lol
2021-04-27 08:22:41,wallstreetbets,Shorts are trying to up their play. Buy shares & hold. Today we rocket

2021-04-27 11:32:27,wallstreetbets,Is it FOMO getting to me or do you 'honestly' see MVIS bouncing back up?

2021-04-27 08:37:55,wallstreetbets,"Call me dumb, but why does everyone speak of pre market? I can trade with Mvis from Germany for hours already. Does that mean, we will see heavy impact, once American market opens?"

2021-04-27 08:52:58,wallstreetbets,i expect a bump after open especially once cnbc starts talking about it again

2021-04-27 07:12:45,wallstreetbets,"In a month, you may hate yourself for not buying them today. That seems to be my history with MVIS. Always thinking its a bad time to buy, then regretting it later."
2021-04-27 13:48:34,wallstreetbets,Found the Cramer
2021-04-27 06:47:50,wallstreetbets,"I've been telling people to join for almost a year now. Got a few friends in. I'd keep buying, but I'm maxed out."
2021-04-27 09:29:08,wallstreetbets,"Understandable. I'm just gonna ride this one out though, missed too many chances not holding"

2021-04-27 11:40:30,wallstreetbets,I take it that the initial dip was to be expected and it's just FOMO affecting me?
2021-04-27 09:01:28,wallstreetbets,I got in in March 2020 at $0.94. I bought $205 worth then. 218 shares (a little over since RH allows partials). I’m holding till the bitter end.

2021-04-27 07:22:13,wallstreetbets,FOMO in a nutshell.
2021-04-27 06:48:48,wallstreetbets,True retard move
2021-04-27 07:28:54,wallstreetbets,"Ya, I’ve had to cut losses (major for myself-2k) lol but think about it, all the time you’re holding that loss, you could have sold and bought something that blows that loss out of the water faster than waiting for the original stock to climb back up."
2021-04-27 06:50:21,wallstreetbets,"It's your call, but I did that at one point and it paid off for me."
2021-04-27 09:50:17,wallstreetbets,that's so fucking retarded
2021-04-27 08:24:17,wallstreetbets,Is that what it is? Kinda glad I have more queued but damn man my heart did not like seeing that dip
2021-04-27 10:05:25,wallstreetbets,How do you know when to sell.  Holding.  Should I buy more today?   At what price to buy again?
2021-04-27 09:47:44,wallstreetbets,"Well, you're here at the right time...  It's taken a 15% shit since open."
2021-04-27 10:15:09,wallstreetbets,please fucking don't and stop chasing meme stocks holy FUCK
2021-04-27 10:00:04,wallstreetbets,"Bad. I'm stuck in the day trade limit. I bought more at $27 after it was going up then like immediately afterwards that's when it tanked. Literally within 30 - 45 secs. Like, wtf is that? Now, I just have to sit back and pray it doesn't tank further because you know that day trade limit designed to stop you from losing all your money sure does a good job of causing you to lose."
2021-04-27 09:53:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah
2021-04-27 09:21:59,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-04-27 09:51:39,wallstreetbets,this aged well
2021-04-27 10:04:40,wallstreetbets,yikes
2021-04-27 10:01:20,wallstreetbets,Forced diamond hands hahahaha
2021-04-27 08:41:25,wallstreetbets,My man
2021-04-27 09:08:06,wallstreetbets,"No, just sharing my opinions."
2021-04-27 13:30:12,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure I didn't look into this one. 

if he has 645 shares \*average cost of 6.0326 it would be an original investment of around $3,891.03

If he screenshotted just before open and the price was around $26.44 that be a 338% increase. Technically, a *gain* needs to be realized so if I noticed it earlier I would have removed it but won't since its been a few hours...that said are you suspicious?"
2021-04-27 15:26:39,wallstreetbets,"Diamond up, you can do it. 💎"
2021-04-27 08:40:12,wallstreetbets,"Nah it’s dipping now, perfect time to buy"
2021-04-27 09:01:41,wallstreetbets,Definitely not too late - this is certainly a $30+ stock. The lidar technology is the ‘unknown value’ right now. Many believe $50+ is cheap. Realistic calculations I’ve seen have shown $96. I’ve seen speculation over $200 which I wouldn’t trust.
2021-04-27 09:52:43,wallstreetbets,"yes, you absolutely did"
2021-04-27 08:34:15,wallstreetbets,I'll be there with you!
2021-04-27 08:30:12,wallstreetbets,Don't sweat it. Buy and hold. People always panic sell and drop off. They'll regret it later
2021-04-27 08:28:24,wallstreetbets,Just buy
2021-04-27 08:43:29,wallstreetbets,Dude it’s down 20 cents off of an 8$ gain... chill.
2021-04-27 08:48:41,wallstreetbets,Pre market volume is very low. Doesn’t take much to move the needle. Everyone will pour in on open and drive price back up.
2021-04-27 09:44:03,wallstreetbets,RIP
2021-04-27 08:44:41,wallstreetbets,It’s not dropping its adjusting for today’s launch
2021-04-27 08:29:07,wallstreetbets,Things usually drop after a rise. It'll only drop if people follow suit
2021-04-27 08:32:26,wallstreetbets,PREACH!!
2021-04-27 08:41:06,wallstreetbets,Typically yes.
2021-04-27 09:10:17,wallstreetbets,Most likely an initial dip prior to the rise. Buy then and hold strong.
2021-04-27 09:09:36,wallstreetbets,Today? I'm hoping $32. Depends if everyone holds strong and continues with yesterday's momentum. $50 is the next major milestone IMO.
2021-04-27 09:09:42,wallstreetbets,31
2021-04-27 09:07:32,wallstreetbets,Better than nothing! You won't be one of the people who miss out and that's what matters.
2021-04-27 09:08:38,wallstreetbets,"Ape grow strong, together."
2021-04-27 09:23:53,wallstreetbets,"Depends. If it does, that's a good point to buy. Everyone reacts so quickly, they don't consider every possibility. I've seen this stock go from $6 to $12 to $18 to $10 and to now. But over time, it's been a winner."
2021-04-27 10:34:52,wallstreetbets,I hopped on a boat that was full sales away 30 secs before an iceberg that was hidden behind a wave jumped in the way.
2021-04-27 12:48:25,wallstreetbets,This aged poorly
2021-04-27 11:23:32,wallstreetbets,19
2021-04-27 09:49:06,wallstreetbets,🤩
2021-04-27 10:21:56,wallstreetbets,Feels the same as rkt eh. Good way to get gains but maybe just a distraction? Idk though.
2021-04-27 08:13:39,wallstreetbets,And by waste you mean doubling the last 2 days?  Interesting definition
2021-04-27 10:16:30,wallstreetbets,"Yo, you can't say it was a waste of money.  I think its a waste to hold on to it now, yes, as the market will begin dropping soon, but a lot of people made a lot of money on mvis."
2021-04-27 08:19:50,wallstreetbets,Holding assets 10y+ with no returns T\_T
2021-04-27 07:34:05,wallstreetbets,Amen to that
2021-04-27 08:56:36,wallstreetbets,What do you think the price is going to be at open?
2021-04-27 09:42:01,wallstreetbets,Damn. I bet that ass hurts rn huh lol
2021-04-27 10:33:01,wallstreetbets,"Same here, bought a bunch more at the dip, hell yeahhhhh..."
2021-04-27 14:04:49,wallstreetbets,yikes
2021-04-27 12:29:09,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-27 07:18:18,wallstreetbets,I bought 5 at $20. Super new to trading and learning a lot.
2021-04-27 12:58:16,wallstreetbets,">I picked up 6 shares averaged at $10.25 because that was all I could afford at the time. Sold 3 yesterday to get my money back out of it plus a small profit. Was kind of kicking myself about it last night, but seeing the drop today makes me think it wasn't such a bad idea."
2021-04-27 08:38:47,wallstreetbets,Piling up cash to buy more
2021-04-27 10:24:57,wallstreetbets,"People always say this, ""They are trying to scare paper hands."" Not everything is a hedge fund conspiracy,  sometimes people just take profits and the price tanks.  A lot of people lose money because they believe statements like this.  The market is not a team sport, we arent all in this together, stop bleeding money when you don't have to, it makes no sense.  Take your profits."
2021-04-27 09:10:22,wallstreetbets,"But if it was going to shoot up more wouldn’t premarket be up 10-20% by now? I have a high feeling people are gonna take profits when market opens. You have diamond handers that have been holding this since .02. It’s $27 now, people are gonna take profits before this goes GME tank style. People have learned..."
2021-04-27 10:28:08,wallstreetbets,"I personally wouldn't, seeing as its dropped significantly and is probably on its way back down and people are taking profits, but that's just me.  Im not a financial advisor though, im just a retard trying to make money."
2021-04-27 10:14:19,wallstreetbets,"sure, totally, why not."
2021-04-27 09:21:08,wallstreetbets,"I will be messaging you in 2 days on [**2021-04-29 13:20:41 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-04-29%2013:20:41%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzlls0/congrats_to_everyone_that_decided_to_join_the/gw1pjmo/?context=3)

2021-04-27 07:36:49,wallstreetbets,Yes sir!
2021-04-27 09:06:58,wallstreetbets,Yeah super risky to buy now for me IMO.
2021-04-27 07:17:14,wallstreetbets,Its so volatile now the options are either too expensive or non-existent..I may however  pick up more shares today.
2021-04-27 07:25:45,wallstreetbets,So hold it after the 29th?
2021-04-27 11:07:32,wallstreetbets,Just need somewhere else to put it
2021-04-27 08:36:10,wallstreetbets,"My stop order has taken effect, I buy again"
2021-04-27 09:03:03,wallstreetbets,God bless you
2021-04-27 08:45:02,wallstreetbets,Let’s go friend 👍👍👍👍
2021-04-27 10:05:47,wallstreetbets,She’ll be back I ain’t selling for Shit
2021-04-27 10:06:24,wallstreetbets,Scram
2021-04-27 07:23:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah but it's still got some gas left. Why would holders profit take when it's going up?
2021-04-27 08:32:12,wallstreetbets,Nothing but a battle beginning. Apes shall prevail!!
2021-04-27 10:18:28,wallstreetbets,What you should do is pull all of your money out of your brokerage account and educate yourself until you're confident enough to not have to ask for random people on the internet to hold your fucking hand in every moment of the trade.
2021-04-27 10:06:35,wallstreetbets,Should by the dips. This should be 35+ with potential to hit 100+. It’s set up perfect for a squeeze
2021-04-27 09:49:11,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-27 10:03:13,wallstreetbets,"Did you already get locked? Because I’d rather have the temporary lock than lose my money. There’s always other brokers and if you’re lucky you can ask them to remove the pdt the first time.

I guess it only really matters if you really want that money back"
2021-04-27 10:01:12,wallstreetbets,Fuccckkk that limit fucked you over man. I havw it to but i but in yesterday and sold today right before it tanked
2021-04-27 10:13:27,wallstreetbets,And Its only 10 o'clock lol
2021-04-27 09:53:34,wallstreetbets,MVIS 17$ EOW
2021-04-27 09:15:43,wallstreetbets,Lol it’s not a $30. It a meme stock pushed by WSB and it’s all over the news. Predicting this will tank anytime.
2021-04-27 08:46:08,wallstreetbets,"But why is it, that I can trade already? Shouldn't I also be only allowed to trade in 2 hours?"
2021-04-27 09:46:32,wallstreetbets,MVIS - %15
2021-04-27 09:16:49,wallstreetbets,Did someone say PLTR?
2021-04-27 09:33:44,wallstreetbets,I like being right every once in a lifetime
2021-04-27 08:58:16,wallstreetbets,I’m thinking (hoping) around 27-28. Happy cake day btw! $MVIS gonna be the gift that keeps giving
2021-04-27 09:47:48,wallstreetbets,Sold right before open because I knew this assfucking was coming hahaha
2021-04-27 09:44:05,wallstreetbets,Not in the slightest
2021-04-27 12:49:37,wallstreetbets,"No bot, i have my shares and i keep them,"
2021-04-27 09:00:52,wallstreetbets,"Bought 20 at $25, im down 12%, now the question ist fill up or just hold?"
2021-04-27 09:36:30,wallstreetbets,"I am also new at this, hoping this is a continued success, and I can feed off the intelligence of others."
2021-04-27 10:41:48,wallstreetbets,I just bought a $22 call expiration 5/21
2021-04-27 10:33:38,wallstreetbets,This shows there are a whole lot of inexperienced new traders thinking yeah we’re all in this together to take down the hedge funds. Everyone is for themselves no one is in it together. I’m not gonna hold so you can sell it before me. I’m gonna sell it before you do. The stock market is a dog eat dog world.
2021-04-27 07:27:30,wallstreetbets,I absolutely will be. Everyone becomes engrossed with instant gratification that they forget about long term gains.
2021-04-27 08:56:37,wallstreetbets,Buy the morning dip
2021-04-27 09:43:36,wallstreetbets,Rip your money haha it's tanking hard Im holding but tempted to sell
2021-04-27 10:19:35,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I hope for your sake it does."
2021-04-27 09:51:08,wallstreetbets,"""it's still got some gas left""

what the fuck kind of technical analysis is this? GME has destroyed this sub."
2021-04-27 09:14:34,wallstreetbets,"Because people have learned from GME and AMC. When you see life changing money in front of you and not sell you’ll regret it so much more than selling, taking profits even if it goes up more later."
2021-04-27 08:36:05,wallstreetbets,Teach me daddy
2021-04-27 10:18:58,wallstreetbets,"No, it is not."
2021-04-27 10:18:39,wallstreetbets,Thanks you.  I will learn what a squeeze is.  Lol
2021-04-27 10:04:19,wallstreetbets,That’s called gambling not investing
2021-04-27 10:31:16,wallstreetbets,"I believe people should learn by experience and not be locked out of learning. If you're buying stocks you're kind of 'gambling', but a type of gambling where the odds are even. The Day Trade Limit adds a rule that will fuck over new stock traders far more than helps them. Once you're more experienced the day trade limit (once you know how to manage it better) makes more sense.

It makes more sense as a rule with severe odds against you like with casino gambling.

It's a bs rule that actually hurts new traders far more than helps them. It's very discouraging and it makes you not want to trade stocks."
2021-04-27 10:05:23,wallstreetbets,Yup. They say it's to protect you. It's not. Like everything in life the system is designed to fuck you over with colorful uplifting language. This really fucks over new stock traders vs. helping them.
2021-04-27 10:08:18,wallstreetbets,What do you think the floor is today?
2021-04-27 09:53:18,wallstreetbets,It reached $30.80 at 1:30am today. I took a screenshot.
2021-04-27 14:49:25,wallstreetbets,It’s a meme stock to you because you probably know little about and only have just heard of the company. Research their patents - watch their products demonstrations on YouTube. Read about the military applications. Then see if you still believe this is just a ‘meme stock’.
2021-04-27 09:58:54,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-04-27 09:29:41,wallstreetbets,HOLD!!!!
2021-04-27 08:18:36,wallstreetbets,Most of us are going to overdose on art supplies before we get to long term gains tax
2021-04-27 08:58:39,wallstreetbets,Yes already did
2021-04-27 09:56:37,wallstreetbets,She’ll be back
2021-04-27 10:26:55,wallstreetbets,See you after lunch
2021-04-27 10:25:58,wallstreetbets,Please not worried the least You think I’m dumb to throw my whole wardrobe in at the highest it’s been just to sell low. No you idiot I got in waiting on big news. Go die in a gutter somewhere buddy
2021-04-27 10:42:01,wallstreetbets,You guys are pretty dumb to think one would throw his entire savings into this thing I wasn’t born yesterday bud just taking a chance with some small money
2021-04-27 08:47:02,wallstreetbets,You know what you do to a bully? Punch him right in the face! See you at 100+
2021-04-27 10:13:04,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-27 10:07:53,wallstreetbets,It really leaves out all the traders with a few hundred dollars or thousands it fucked
2021-04-27 09:55:08,wallstreetbets,"Oh that’s great, it lasted for...how long?

Did you take a screenshot of it now though?"
2021-04-27 10:57:29,wallstreetbets,"Damn, so can I hope for another visit to the moon?"
2021-04-27 10:14:55,wallstreetbets,I hope so man haha
2021-04-27 14:44:27,wallstreetbets,Have you had lunch yet lol
2021-04-27 08:51:53,wallstreetbets,"I feel like there’s a pun in there, something something bullish stock something"
2021-04-27 10:16:23,wallstreetbets,"""I'm ready to lose it all, but also ready for the gains""

That's called gambling

Prepare to blow your entire account before you even graduate college"
2021-04-27 14:54:09,wallstreetbets,Buddy like I said I bought in as a chance that this thing will get bought out and or good pr coming  for the company. I’m not hard up for money here so I plan on hanging around till I’m full.
2021-04-27 14:55:24,wallstreetbets,We’ll continue this convo when I’m in the green 😜😜🙌🌱cheers man
2021-04-27 10:31:15,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-27 14:44:51,wallstreetbets,Damn I’m usually good at spotting sarcasm but there are so many idiots around here these days I can’t tell any more

2021-04-27 07:59:40,wallstreetbets,I wish everytime there are companies going public we get a list like this... I am not trying to lick your asshole clean OP  but this post really was perfect for someone like me
2021-04-27 06:33:08,wallstreetbets,EDR could be interesting
2021-04-27 08:08:57,wallstreetbets,Also Mind Med getting listed on nasdaq today!

I invested early in this and hope that it'll rocket but mostly I can't wait to see the positive impact it'll have on society when it succeeds.

2021-04-27 09:02:02,wallstreetbets,Why is this gunna rise🤔
2021-04-27 09:49:58,wallstreetbets,trading halted...
2021-04-27 10:02:00,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip and HOLD.
2021-04-27 12:16:03,wallstreetbets,"If you plan to stay in MNMD until it at least doubles, you'll make way more money buying MindMed **warrants.**

I favor the one expiring in 2024, with stock symbol **MMDCF.**

Here's a brief explanation, with rounded figures for ease of understanding:

MNMD is currently ~$5/share. MMDCF is ~$1.50/share.

MMDCF has an exercise price ~$5.50. Translation: Buying one unit of MMDCF = buying the right to buy a share of MNMD for $5.50.

Suppose you spend $15 today on MMED (3 shares) and $15 on MMDCF (10 shares). Time passes and MNMD reaches $10/share. Here's your profit margin:

**MNMD:** $5 shares now worth $10 -> your 3 shares are worth $30  (**100% profit**, 2x orig investment)

**MMDCF:** each warrant lets you buy a share worth $10 by paying $5.50 on top of your initial $1.50, for a total profit of $3. You don't actually have to lay out the cash to exercise; you can just sell the warrants to someone else. So your $1.50 shares are now worth $4.50 -> your 10 shares are worth $45 (**200% profit**, 3x orig investment)

The higher the share price ends up, the better the multiplier. And the lower you share price when you buy, the better the multiplier.

Since options aren't currently available, warrants are the next-best thing, and probably the best thing outright if you're looking to invest for a year or longer.

MMDCF is good. This is not financial advice."

2021-04-27 12:45:50,wallstreetbets,"No this one had a run a few months back. Part of the mushroom meme. It just got listed on NASDAQ today, prior to today you had to go to the OTC Canada cuckville market to get. Also this means options to open up soon for this one probably."

2021-04-27 12:57:05,wallstreetbets,at the current trend it'll be lucky to break $5 again. it's kinda stuck at 4.50-4.80
2021-04-27 11:48:25,wallstreetbets,Just day traders with no interest in the actual stock.  Real growth coming next
2021-04-27 07:17:21,wallstreetbets,You should have access to it at open. MNMD is what you'll be looking for.
2021-04-27 08:37:52,wallstreetbets,That's what you get for still being on RH.

What do you think about Neonmind?  


I've been wanting to get into this one but none of my brokers let me buy. I know it's a penny stock so this might get removed, but fuck it. It's relevant. It has the old CEO from MMED"
2021-04-27 11:13:02,wallstreetbets,why have i heard more about this woman's picks than anything else since i entered the market?

2021-04-27 10:35:00,wallstreetbets,Bought in at $5.90 pre-market and again now at $4.75...dollar cost averaging my way to the moon  🚀

2021-04-27 12:45:46,wallstreetbets,I am 100% getting back in once this one corrects. Riding the meme boom is always a fun way to make a little profit along the way though. Definitely a fan of this one as a long play though.
2021-04-27 07:56:45,wallstreetbets,Where did you see this??
2021-04-27 09:14:33,wallstreetbets,You glimpsed the future
2021-04-27 08:45:29,wallstreetbets,It’s looking like it took Friday’s closing price and took that difference from the current price

2021-04-27 10:27:19,wallstreetbets,"You can't (Typically), but in this case, it wasn't an IPO, it was just being listed on a new exchange (NASDAQ). It's a Canadian company that was listed as an OTC"

2021-04-27 07:25:37,wallstreetbets,It will trade under MNMD from today - get in at open!
2021-04-27 10:37:25,wallstreetbets,It just hit the market at 6:00 am today. You were looking around 5:00 I presume from the comment time
2021-04-27 12:52:22,wallstreetbets,I can’t trade it at all it’s not showing up every time I search
2021-04-27 12:04:27,wallstreetbets,I found it.. when your searching on fidelity nothing shows up until you actually hit the search button.. (even though it says no results it will come up and you can add it to a watch list)

2021-04-27 07:31:11,wallstreetbets,Got it.  Trying to find it premarket but it’s not showing up.  Guess I’ll wait until opening at 939.
2021-04-27 10:04:50,wallstreetbets,The people who wanted to make money bought when it was still trading on OTC to dump on you :(
2021-04-27 09:47:13,wallstreetbets,But its going down 😰😰

2021-04-27 08:34:17,wallstreetbets,I think you have to wait until they open the market. Yesterday it was under MMED on fidelity if I'm not wrong. They change the ticker today to MNMD

Replace your weekend Vegas trip with a stock market gambit on an unproven company with lots of potential.  Always remember when a company is unproven and unprofitable you are participating in a bet, not so much an investment.  


If you want investments, look to companies already proven to make money and be profitable.  The downside is those companies don't have as much big price movement potential, so no one is making 50% gains in a single day type payoff."
2021-04-27 07:38:39,wallstreetbets,whatever you can afford. not a financial advisor. I had 30k in savings and dumped 25k into this stock. I believe in the company and their medicine.

2021-04-27 10:08:35,wallstreetbets,How is it cheap? It's doubled since last week.
2021-04-27 10:30:59,wallstreetbets,I just bought 100 shares for 4.50 - like 5 minutes ago on RH
2021-04-27 11:30:51,wallstreetbets,Held through the spike and dip. Got in yesterday at open for 4.50 and it keeps reflecting off that price point.

2021-04-27 08:36:26,wallstreetbets,Can’t go wrong with shares. Only just listed on NASDAQ on Monday so no options for a week at least (is typical)
2021-04-27 10:01:53,wallstreetbets,"Buying the stock outright isn't a terrible idea if it hits $10 either. 

Practice with fake calls, don't trade any money just choose some plays and see how they turn out. Probably even apps for taht - then document if you're actually doing well or not rather than being a revisionist historian and remembering when you ""could have"" made it big and forgetting all the times you would have lost your butt cheeks."
2021-04-27 11:27:59,wallstreetbets,Why buy in if you think it will crash and burn? Lol
2021-04-27 10:10:18,wallstreetbets,psst don’t get in my way of hyping this shit up
2021-04-27 10:45:05,wallstreetbets,Again. Learn the fucking market. Circuit breakers happen when stocks drop or rise a certain percentage over a certain short period. They last a set amount of time.
2021-04-27 12:01:57,wallstreetbets,"Lots of volume on the MMED side today, seems like a lot of people taking profits right at/around $6CAD. I’m thinking it’ll still run up near the end of the day, but that might just be wishful thinking on my part."

2021-04-27 07:46:00,wallstreetbets,I see.. thank you for the information it helps me out a lot. I understand why this investment has the potential to be worth it.. do you recommend anything about calls?
2021-04-27 08:25:12,wallstreetbets,Let borrow like 2500 shares
2021-04-27 08:56:32,wallstreetbets,Agreed - this is the future.  I opened a position yesterday.  This is a long term hold for me now.
2021-04-27 12:12:23,wallstreetbets,I didnt think it would when i bought lol. but now things are lookin so good for us 😅😅
2021-04-27 10:13:29,wallstreetbets,Its $CUM time!

2021-04-27 09:52:01,wallstreetbets,"Lol fr, the delusion in this thread. I’ve got some shares of MNMD but there’s no way it’ll hit $10/share, and even if it does nobody should be buying around that price, this is not a multi-billion dollar company (at least for a few years, at the very least) by any stretch of the imagination. 

Sold @ 5.25, will get back in when it pulls back."
2021-04-27 08:40:37,wallstreetbets,"If this is your first time investing, I don't recommend calls they can be a very risky----

Get out of here

Sorry about that, don't know what came over me. For calls you gotta go all in, stonks only go up so calls are just printing money!"
2021-04-27 12:03:54,wallstreetbets,"I am also holding LKYSF, SHRMF, RVVTF, and TRUFF."
2021-04-27 12:37:38,wallstreetbets,I definitely learned to wait a few hours when something comes on to the NASDAQ. Then by. I'm sure it's going back up. A lot of people that probably bought OTC that sold off after doubling their money. No biggie
2021-04-27 10:40:59,wallstreetbets,Scum time ?
2021-04-27 10:03:45,wallstreetbets,I meant for their mom

2021-04-27 08:43:40,wallstreetbets,"I would do a call if I could see them on preopen! It scares me, I’ve seen so many losses with calls.. I might just do a $10 call and see what I can return from that, tons of people are talking about it hitting $10-$15"
2021-04-27 09:17:49,wallstreetbets,Why are calls considered so risky ? Or are we talking bout naked calls ?
2021-04-27 12:41:03,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for letting me know, very interested in this field.  5-10 year hold for me in hopes of big time money.  Having said that, I know people who have been helped by this medicine so this is important on a personal level."
2021-04-27 10:21:35,wallstreetbets,"Wow now I feel like a total jackass lol I agree with their sentiment too, that’s what I get for skimming comments"
2021-04-27 10:42:09,wallstreetbets,"I’d been in since 3.78 a month back, was finally in the green off the news of the new listing. I’m confident that this company has the opportunity to be worth at least a few billion in like 5-10 years (maybe sooner, like 3-5), but I think it’ll drop down a little more once things calm down. I’m waiting a few days before I get back in.

So I wouldn’t necessarily worry if I were you, depending on how much $ you put in and if you’ll need it anytime soon."
2021-04-27 12:00:29,wallstreetbets,"Wasn’t specifically talking about you, I’ve seen plenty of people saying double digits today. 

I agree that a couple years down the line at the earliest we could see >10, but many on social media, and even this thread, are getting way too ahead of themselves.

And I am truly sorry for your loss, I didn’t see that’s part of your comment at first, and thous the loss comment I was replying to was about the stock price dropping in the future."
2021-04-27 09:17:52,wallstreetbets,"why would you buy a call if you don't fully understand them? just buy the fucking stock if you want it man. 

and BTW there is a lot of circle jerking in here so I should remind you of the possibility that this company isn't profitable for a long time. This is a speculative play, I think you should treat it as such."
2021-04-27 12:42:45,wallstreetbets,That’s my plan as well.
2021-04-27 09:19:31,wallstreetbets,"Are you hopping in? I’m not doing calls on it, it was a thought bc how much ppl are hyping this shit up.. it blows my mind how confident they are without knowing, I guess that’s why I still have yet to invest in shit like this, it makes me nervous but I know I can’t have a love attachment to it"
2021-04-27 09:29:19,wallstreetbets,I am not buying any of this today. I expect it is over hyped and will shoot up the first half the day and then start trending down. but I could be completely wrong.
2021-04-27 10:39:59,wallstreetbets,"They are gambling. It's fun, I have 1000 shares of MMED @ $3, but the price can go anywhere at this point, including into the trash if their trials don't work out in the next couple years and other companies come and eat their lunch in this sector. Between regulation concerns and inherent risk of investing in a company that just loses money, there are reasons not to just go balls deep because people on the internet are doing it. 

That said if you understand you're on a gambling subreddit, this is a good stock to gamble on because the potential is massive and it's still early"

2021-04-27 10:20:25,wallstreetbets,FOMOing into MVIS after it’s gone up 150% in a week is exactly what wsb is all about.

One week out: Multiple DD posts start hitting front page

Three days out: Ticker starts dominating the daily thread

One day out: Nothing but newb comments. “Do you think X will keep going up??!”

2021-04-27 12:55:01,wallstreetbets,"From the outside looking in, I get why everyone shat on $GME every time it dipped. This is fun to do to $MVIS right now."
2021-04-27 14:45:21,wallstreetbets,I suspect WSB is compromised. I've never seen so many posts being upvoted so quick for MNMD. Hell of a pump and dump

100% profits."
2021-04-27 10:05:20,wallstreetbets,"I feel bad for anybody that saw all the MVIS comments these past few days and decided to hop in after it already rocketed. A LOT of those bullish MVIS comments were made by bots or purchased accounts. Found a few yesterday myself. 

One account had 15+ bullish MVIS comments just yesterday and yet prior to yesterday the account hadn’t commented for over a year, and the only comments the account had from a year ago were military related and there were only like 7 comments. 

Be careful out there boys"
2021-04-27 10:12:15,wallstreetbets,PSA: Anyone telling you to hold or buy more just wants you to drive the price back up so they can sell for a better price. They don't give a fuck about your account.

Compass’ IPO is perhaps a bellwether signaling that some Wall Street investors are comfortable betting on drugs that are still federally illegal. **The company’s stock jumped 71% in its first day of trading. As of Thursday, the stock was up 134% from its IPO price of $17 per share.**"

*On one screen, I'm watching this thread with people gushing about MVIS.*

*On  the other screen, I'm watching the dark pool action on buying up shares  of MVIS, and I'm remembering where I've seen this movie before (the  movie theater, Nokia, BB, the weed stocks, Express, etc.)*

*Then there's the screen in my brain, which is showing how epic this rug pull is going to be later this week.*

Oh, the hate, the HATE I got for that.  The fuck off, you don't know what you're talking abouts, the ""you can't possibly know what those orders are because they're blocks"", etc.

AMD behaves illogically but it would require extreme retardation for AMD to go down after this earnings, especially since boomers and analysts are waking up to how far behind Intel actually is after their last earnings call."

2021-04-27 08:12:18,wallstreetbets,"It is April 27th, this is your morning update.

After becoming a darling of the MVIS crowd, Cramer is now a villain for calling the stock overpriced. His comments have caused a dump, further entrenching the hate for him on Wall Street Bets.

Meanwhile, Meme Money was seen moving into MNMD. It is no surprise the WSB gang are attracted to substances that allow them to escape their lives. Expect a moon mission of epic proportions."
2021-04-27 08:23:50,wallstreetbets,😭 MVIS please go back up to 30
2021-04-27 08:38:20,wallstreetbets,My guys I’m not selling MVIS until they get sold and even then I might just hold onto whatever I get out of it
2021-04-27 08:42:57,wallstreetbets,It’s obvious that we are onto bigger and more trippy things ... MNMD

2021-04-27 09:50:48,wallstreetbets,MNMD just got dumped on by a load of shorts trying to trigger mass selloff.  Keep in mind a lot of these shorts shorted at like $2.50 or less.

2021-04-27 08:12:08,wallstreetbets,MVIS just minted a bunch of bagholders this premarket
2021-04-27 08:18:53,wallstreetbets,What happened to 30.30 pre market mvis?
2021-04-27 08:24:31,wallstreetbets,Are you all buying Mind med this morning? If so are you buying shares or doing calls?
2021-04-27 08:53:26,wallstreetbets,can anyone buy MNMD? its trading in pre but my order wont fill.

2021-04-27 09:45:09,wallstreetbets,My apologies everyone. I bought GME. It stopped immediately.
2021-04-27 09:45:13,wallstreetbets,"1000 shares of MNMD at open 5.27 cost average, ya love to see it"

2021-04-27 10:21:26,wallstreetbets,"Well here is the reality:
I woke up yesterday, put $1000 into MVIS hoping to make a little profit on the ride up, then remembered I moved like $10k to a different broker and couldn't day trade anymore.
Held MVIS until today, sold for $1250.

Can't complain, I genuinely expected less"
2021-04-27 10:21:59,wallstreetbets,GME volume is 4M. Lol. Still green

2021-04-27 10:42:53,wallstreetbets,Why is the market red today?  My star charts patreon subscription said that mars was in the house of power and that historically that is good symbol for strength of bulls!
2021-04-27 10:55:57,wallstreetbets,I'm going heavy on MMED. It will take time but shrooms will follow the footsteps of weed. Not hard to imagine this a few years down the line. Also once options are available this shit is gonna get wild
2021-04-27 11:00:24,wallstreetbets,MNMD is a long term play.. why are people acting like nothing happened after the stock almost tripled in value in 3 days.. get it cheap now while you can before the stigma around psychedelics fades even more
2021-04-27 11:03:53,wallstreetbets,Look at you being strong PLTR. I’m so proud of you buddy

2021-04-27 13:13:35,wallstreetbets,"The louder the TSLA bull, the higher his cost basis."
2021-04-27 13:22:52,wallstreetbets,The drop on MVIS makes sense but these are all people who bought in on the earnings call play. The real test is Thursday and Friday after whatever supplementary announcement is made during the call. At least that's what my infant brain tells me to say cuz everyone else is.
2021-04-27 13:28:03,wallstreetbets,maybe if i stare REALLY HARD at the graphs they'll go up.

2021-04-27 08:24:15,wallstreetbets,"More than that... this is a calculated walk down that can only happen this efficiently with fewer shares in PM/AH... they know they'll get flooded with volume at the open. Their goal is to influence sentiment as much as possible while covering as much of their short positions as possible to free up the borrowed shares so that they can either a) short the shit out of it at the open if they influenced sentiment enough to force a dip or b) have those shares available to short the shit out of us at the top when the momentum dies down

2021-04-27 10:52:06,wallstreetbets,"If you think MVIS isn't on an incredible run you're retarded.

If you think now is the time to buy MVIS you're retarded."
2021-04-27 12:27:07,wallstreetbets,Just played a round of diarrhea or fart and lost😞
2021-04-27 14:11:03,wallstreetbets,"The amount of MVIS people saying ""hold that shit if you believe in it"" like bro, half of the people who FOMOd in don't even know what MVIS fuckin does in the first place how are they supposed to believe 🤣"
2021-04-27 14:34:48,wallstreetbets,If you fell for every bear trap today show yourself

2021-04-27 09:08:22,wallstreetbets,MVIS Beacon teaches you how to trade.
2021-04-27 09:32:52,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I chose MVIS instead of MNMD. That means MVIS will tank and MNMD will moon. I am sorry yall."
2021-04-27 09:36:28,wallstreetbets,"Psychonauts, it’s our time to print 🍄 and then trip out in a public park for 8 hours and learn that money isn’t real anyway"
2021-04-27 09:36:49,wallstreetbets,mnmd made me chuckle for a moment... thought i lost 500 bucks in 30 seconds lol
2021-04-27 09:41:57,wallstreetbets,"MVIS puts printed - closed out position. thx guys. I can't believe I was able to ride MVIS both ways, lol. this is the way."
2021-04-27 09:56:49,wallstreetbets,MNMD heading back to the upside
2021-04-27 09:57:32,wallstreetbets,Bought some more MVIS
2021-04-27 10:04:34,wallstreetbets,"I only have one request MVIS bag holders, don’t spam charts with bright colored lines pointing to the squeeze"
2021-04-27 10:24:16,wallstreetbets,How is MNMD not above 10 yet is there an error in the nasdaq?
2021-04-27 10:30:51,wallstreetbets,"After all the paper hands sell, diamond master race will take mvis to the moon. Buy that dip before it’s not a dip"
2021-04-27 10:34:39,wallstreetbets,"I didn't lose money on MVIS, but I wouldn't say I made any."
2021-04-27 11:28:16,wallstreetbets,"MVIS holding at 21-22. Might still be milk in those udders.  


PLTR is up and I don't know what to do with my hands"

2021-04-27 12:34:17,wallstreetbets,Buy MNMD? Am I gonna regret not buying later?
2021-04-27 13:02:51,wallstreetbets,"Glad I sold 95% of my MVIS yesterday. Except I bought a bunch of MNMD in pre market. I fuckin knew this was the likely scenario, FOMO is a hell of a drug"
2021-04-27 13:20:30,wallstreetbets,"Hey GME, make up your damn mind."
2021-04-27 13:23:49,wallstreetbets,Fauci spoke about Covaxin (OCGN) today
2021-04-27 14:29:06,wallstreetbets,My MVIS puts really do be printing though

2021-04-27 07:06:01,wallstreetbets,Cat just came in from the rain and soaking wet. He’s got a strange look in his eyes. Might be a good trading day
2021-04-27 07:06:30,wallstreetbets,Hats off to the mvis pain train - you guys got me. Closing my $18 puts this AM. Repositioning my 40% loss...will sell ATM call spreads instead and probably wind up breaking even (as long as mvis doesn’t go bonkers)
2021-04-27 07:52:02,wallstreetbets,"today is going to be a perfect day, mindmed listing & gme"
2021-04-27 07:55:43,wallstreetbets,I want to buy MNMD but I’m scared people will just dump it after it’s live on robinhood

2021-04-27 08:55:03,wallstreetbets,Oh shit Black rock is trying to say now is not the time to bail out of stocks.
2021-04-27 08:55:17,wallstreetbets,"So what happens when new stuff goes live. Like MNMD? Will it just blast off or do people take profits and it dips quick, like COINBASE did?"
2021-04-27 09:05:41,wallstreetbets,Fidelity still says MNMD doesn't exist. Am I on the old folks app?
2021-04-27 09:10:17,wallstreetbets,Stock only go up now？
2021-04-27 09:18:47,wallstreetbets,Any dip in GME this morning will be gobbled up so fast!!  Expect a volatile day! 🙌💎🚀
2021-04-27 09:23:58,wallstreetbets,"Serious question.  After MNMD finishes their research, is it even legal to give people LSD, mushrooms, MDMA, etc.  I bought in yesterday but haven’t done any deep research"
2021-04-27 09:27:09,wallstreetbets,Buy low sell high
2021-04-27 09:40:54,wallstreetbets,"Some of y’all get way too emotionally attached lol, take profits don’t be a bitch"

2021-04-27 09:49:37,wallstreetbets,MNMD halted. This can’t be good
2021-04-27 09:49:55,wallstreetbets,"just my luck, my first ever trade is MNMD and this happens"
2021-04-27 09:51:33,wallstreetbets,"Sad day for our meme stocks, let's hope that at least GME can hold"

2021-04-27 08:27:10,wallstreetbets,"The first 30 minutes of market open are gonna be fucking crazy for MVIS. 

Looks like shorts are trying to bring the price down.

At the same time higher strikes have been added to the option chain.

Retail is gonna gobble the cheap options up, thus forcing market makers to delta hedge.

Market makers gonna fight the shorts.

Implied volatility should shoot up like a rocket."

2021-04-27 15:12:04,wallstreetbets,Man this used to be a diamond hand subreddit now all I see are crying little whiny paperhanded babies complaining about not getting rich quick. MVIS is down 22%!!! So the fuck what? It’s up 80% overall you dull witted fuck. Stop selling and be patient for once in your life.
2021-04-27 06:51:03,wallstreetbets,"MVIS this.. MVIS that. Can I just get SNAP, RDFN, SPCE and PENN to stop shitting themselves"

2021-04-27 07:39:27,wallstreetbets,I wonder if today will be filled with halts on GME
2021-04-27 07:44:22,wallstreetbets,"PLTR looking suspiciously good this week, can't wait for it to drill soon 😌"

2021-04-27 08:31:38,wallstreetbets,"weed is back on the menu bois.

Hopefully."
2021-04-27 08:44:34,wallstreetbets,I could write the most amazing DD on MNMD like their recent partnership & starting a school at the prestigious NYU that coincides with their research but I feel like the collective consciousness is already at work 🛐
2021-04-27 09:15:26,wallstreetbets,"And MVIS back to mostly 27 USD, poor hedgy boys, you cannot fight against some real soldiers like us."

2021-04-27 10:07:45,wallstreetbets,The reactions in this group are so short sighted. MVIS is a good company. Yes after a stock rises $10 in one day it's due for a market sell off.  Can't handle panicked teenie boppers anymore.
2021-04-27 10:21:54,wallstreetbets,You guys promised shroom tendies

MVIS - seems like a p&d to me, and we appear to be at the ‘d’ part. Imo the fundamentals just don’t support it going any higher than it currently is. I’ve been wrong before, tho.

MNMD - this is a good long-term hold (I’m talking years down the line), but trying to make money off it today (or anytime soon) is probly gonna be pretty hard.

GME - honestly I don’t even fucking know at this point. Anyone know if there’s any specific catalysts causing the surge, or is it just pure retard strength?"

2021-04-27 10:23:43,wallstreetbets,People buying MNMD must be seeing things I can’t see.
2021-04-27 10:26:03,wallstreetbets,Celebrated MVIS by going to GameStop and buying a used copy of sea of thieves. Been wanting to play that game forever and all the profit from the sale goes straight to GME :)

When they say ""to the moon"" they sit on their hands and short at 9:15AM.

They post doctored screenshots of massive buy-ins to get you excited.

When they call you ""diamond hands"" they mean ""bag holder"".

The real trick is they act like losers after the fact to make you feel at home.

They laugh at you.

Still really happy for you, I hope that you have hands made of diamonds and make me regret not investing in BB at current levels."

2021-04-27 12:09:08,wallstreetbets,"If you plan to stay in MNMD until it at least doubles, you'll make way more money buying MindMed **warrants.**

I favor the one expiring in 2024, with stock symbol **MMDCF.**

Here's a brief explanation, with rounded figures for ease of understanding:

MNMD is currently ~$5/share. MMDCF is ~$1.50/share.

MMDCF has an exercise price ~$5.50. Translation: Buying one unit of MMDCF = buying the right to buy a share of MNMD for $5.50.

Suppose you spend $15 today on MMED (3 shares) and $15 on MMDCF (10 shares). Time passes and MNMD reaches $10/share. Here's your profit margin:

**MNMD:** $5 shares now worth $10 -> your 3 shares are worth $30  (**100% profit**, 2x orig investment)

**MMDCF:** each warrant lets you buy a share worth $10 by paying $5.50 on top of your initial $1.50, for a total profit of $3. You don't actually have to lay out the cash to exercise; you can just sell the warrants to someone else. So your $1.50 shares are now worth $4.50 -> your 10 shares are worth $45 (**200% profit**, 3x orig investment)

The higher the share price ends up, the better the multiplier. And the lower you share price when you buy, the better the multiplier.

Since options aren't currently available, warrants are the next-best thing, and probably the best thing outright if you're looking to invest for a year or longer.

MMDCF is good. This is not financial advice."
2021-04-27 12:13:16,wallstreetbets,"MNMD @ $5.77, looks like I'm in for the long haul now.

Also, PLTR weekly call. RKT, FRSX, CLOV long term calls."

This is what you will get with Mind Med.

Don’t let anyone tell you any different. Especially your own delusional brain.

2021-04-27 10:31:48,wallstreetbets,"I bought into most of my MVIS around 18$. This was one of the first investments I ever made. I also bought into Tilray, Webilt, and Clov for the long term. 

I rode MVIS up to 29$ and was planning to hold thru today. But it appears the party is over and I'd rather not be caught with my pants around my ankles. I only had a few hundred dollars invested as this was purely for practice investing. I just wanted to invest a little, learn about stocks, research, and try to make a Lil profit. 

I sold off my MVIS at around 25$ for a tidy profit of 60$ or so. Very happy as a total noob. If it pops off again later in the week I'll be bummed out but as of right now I'm just happy for playing things safer and smarter and leaving with more than I put in. I'll continue to invest as my confidence grows. 

Remember, there will always be another MVIS. Don't get attached to stocks. They're not pets or loved ones. Let them go when it's their time"
2021-04-27 08:41:55,wallstreetbets,So much FUD from MVIS put holders.  If it drops below my cost basis I am just going to buy more and average down.

2021-04-27 06:51:12,wallstreetbets,"Stock futures are flat this morning. Nothing doing at all really. Yesterday all but the Dow Industrials were positive and the S&P and Nasdaq closed at new record highs..

It should be a busy day with plenty of earnings to move things along. As I write this, UPS just came in with a beat on earnings and revenues. That’s another good sign for the economy. During market hours we’ll hear from 3M, Hasbro, JetBlue, Starbucks, Wynn Resorts, and others. After the close it will be Google/Alphabet, AMD, Microsoft, Texas Instruments, and Visa. Many others as well but those are the ones that have my attention.

We also have the start of the Fed meetings today, but shouldn’t be hearing very much from that until tomorrow.

Stocks have been quietly ‘melting up’ for awhile. That may accelerate. Commodities are cranking along, with copper, wheat, corn, soybeans, and coffee at or near multi-year highs. The ‘soft commodities’ (wheat, corn, soybeans) are particularly frothy. Check out the charts if you have a chance.

Until the inflation narrative takes hold and forces the Fed to start tapering it should still be all systems go for risk assets. Some earnings disappointments notwithstanding of course."

2021-04-27 11:51:40,wallstreetbets,VIAC officially bounced hard off the 200dma. Buy volume is 70% higher than sell volume now and short interest decreased 30%. I expect this to grind up to the 100dma pretty quickly ($52) and then the 50dma ($62). Then the momentum should push this up to $80 pretty quickly after that.

2021-04-27 06:22:40,wallstreetbets,"If markets go down, shares become cheaper and therefore more attractive to foreign investors, leading to a rush of capital into the US markets. The fx market is just like any market: dictated by supply and demand. An increase in demand for the US stock market (and in turn the US dollar because you first need to convert a foreign currency into US dollar in order to buy US stocks), leads to a strengthening of the dollar.

2021-04-27 12:54:22,wallstreetbets,I'm starting to think that doesn't matter....there's nothing they could say short of a buyout for XX a share that would justify their valuation at this point.  This thing is done.  I should have sold yesterday:(
2021-04-27 12:54:26,wallstreetbets,Plan to rebuy back in after the dump. Maybe I can make back a bit with the extra shares cause I am always like 1 hour late to the party
2021-04-27 12:54:53,wallstreetbets,From 150% up to only 100% up and yea it’s P&D. Not to mention sell the news is typical in any stocks 🤦🏻

2021-04-27 13:05:15,wallstreetbets,Sold half this morning at 100% to recoup my buy in. Sitting with 60 shares left and bought a put to play the other side. I still think there is room to upswing with earnings and the other stuff possibly by eom
2021-04-27 13:09:14,wallstreetbets,Bad trip
2021-04-27 13:17:26,wallstreetbets,Probably partly because alot of people cant buy it

hypothetical: you have 1000 traders making 1000 trades each in 8 hours. that's roughly 2,000 trades per second.

Now, you take those same traders and increase time by 3x, you have many fewer trades per time unit, wider spreads, and thus, a less efficient market."

2021-04-27 18:30:17,wallstreetbets,just wait
2021-04-27 06:33:54,wallstreetbets,Im gonna be cautious on it but still get in. Probably plenty of low price entry folk ready to take their profits after a few more days of run-up but I think it'll run for a little while longer

2021-04-27 09:59:43,wallstreetbets,a limit sell would have sold it at 20 or higher.  maybe you wanted a Stop Limit where you could have told it to sell if it dropped to 20?

2021-04-27 12:38:16,wallstreetbets,now write something about PLTR -
2021-04-27 12:40:09,wallstreetbets,"For Mvis it was like we already had buyout announced I assume most of it will hinge on 29th if they announce buyout or really good results will go gangbusters if not negative or positive 17-20 range. If something negative happens maybe all the way back to the lows we saw. 

For Gme I think the news is the fact that gamestop has completed the share selling. They raised like 551 million which could go far in the transformation of the business. Also it means the price has gone up even with them issuing shares so there wont be future dilution."
2021-04-27 14:40:30,wallstreetbets,It's like knowingly letting Mileena in Mortal Kombat giving you a bj.

2021-04-27 10:56:46,wallstreetbets,"A judge tells a condemned prisoner that he will be hanged at noon on one weekday in the following week but that the execution will be a surprise to the prisoner. He will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner knocks on his cell door at noon that day.
Having reflected on his sentence, the prisoner draws the conclusion that he will escape from the hanging. His reasoning is in several parts. He begins by concluding that the ""surprise hanging"" can't be on Friday, as if he hasn't been hanged by Thursday, there is only one day left - and so it won't be a surprise if he's hanged on Friday. Since the judge's sentence stipulated that the hanging would be a surprise to him, he concludes it cannot occur on Friday.

He then reasons that the surprise hanging cannot be on Thursday either, because Friday has already been eliminated and if he hasn't been hanged by Wednesday noon, the hanging must occur on Thursday, making a Thursday hanging not a surprise either. By similar reasoning, he concludes that the hanging can also not occur on Wednesday, Tuesday or Monday. Joyfully he retires to his cell confident that the hanging will not occur at all.

The next week, the executioner knocks on the prisoner's door at noon on Wednesday — which, despite all the above, was an utter surprise to him. Everything the judge said came true."

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Markets crash every time Oreo releases an even greater-stuffed cookie The increasingly-depraved debuts of Oreos with more stuffing indicate unstable amounts of greed and leverage in the system, serving as an immediate indicator of that the makings of a market crash are in place. Conversely, when the Oreo team reduces the amount of icing in their treats, markets tend to have great bull runs until once again society demands to push the boundaries of how much stuffing is possible.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oreo_varieties https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_market_crashes_and_bear_markets

1974: Double Stuf Oreo released. Dow Jones crashes 45%. FTSE drops 73%.

1987: Big Stuf Oreo released. Black Monday, a 20% single-day crash and a following bear market.

1991: Mini Oreo introduced. Smaller icing ratios coincide with the 1991 Japanese asset price bubble, confirming the correlation works both ways and a reduction of Oreo icing may be a potential solution to preventing a future crash.

2011: Triple Double Oreo introduced. S&P drops 21% in a 5-month bear market

2015: Oreo Thins introduced. A complete lack of icing causes an unprecedented bull run in the S&P for years

2019: The Most Stuf Oreo briefly introduced. Pulled off the shelf before any major market damage could occur.

2021: The Most Stuf Oreo reintroduced. Market response: ???"
2021-04-27 06:14:20,wallstreetbets,This is the kind of hard hitting financial analysis that keeps me coming back here. Great work.
2021-04-27 06:15:12,wallstreetbets,This is ultra instinct saiyan god tier level equivalent DD comparable to the moon phase gme guy😥📈
2021-04-27 08:13:55,wallstreetbets,Former Nabisco employee. Don’t forget the release of Game of Thrones Oreos that lead to the worst finale of one the greatest series. Clear correlation and DD
2021-04-27 05:54:09,wallstreetbets,"Now, this is the kind of DD I come here for.

Next you'll be telling me Lil' Yachty is cutting new tracks, too."

2021-04-27 06:35:09,wallstreetbets,This is the kind of DD you won't find on CNBC or anywhere else. Well done!
2021-04-27 07:51:24,wallstreetbets,"2022.  Oreo deletes useless black, cookie *thingy* after too many customer complaints of having to waste time chewing. Introduces gelatinous tube fulled with sugary goo, bypassing the cookie. 

Consumes rejoice. Retail investors go into type-2 diabetic coma. Markets collapse. Economy crashes. 

Zombie Apocalypse ensues.  Life as we know it ends."
2021-04-27 07:14:33,wallstreetbets,"If I knew society’s economic strength hinges on a god damn cookie, I probably wouldn’t have started trading"

2021-04-27 08:32:31,wallstreetbets,"Im gonna say your DD is almost and I mean it, almost perfect. You just left out Mega Stuf Oreo, introduced in February 2013, similar to Double Stuf Oreo cookies, but with even more white creme filling. This one didn't have an effect on the market. Anyway I'm gonna go put half of my savings into VIX just because of some oreos xd"
2021-04-27 07:48:31,wallstreetbets,"This makes sense though, products like this get introduced when the market is up and market sentiment is at multi-year highs.  We're talking about what basically amounts to the trail end of a bull run, right before a bubble pops.  It's an effect, not a cause.

Likewise, Jello tracks smaller tend sentiment and uses that to decide when to release coupons for Jello pudding.  Feeling down?  Buy Jello pudding, it's cheap comfort food."
2021-04-27 06:39:26,wallstreetbets,Market Crash confirmed. Holding my GME even tighter

2021-04-27 08:50:58,wallstreetbets,This is very thorough work. So many indicators to measure yet you navigated to the perfect correlation. I was very encouraged to see the imminent arrival of Popeye’s Chicken to the UK coinciding with GME breaking back into 3 figures. But my pool of indicators to study was limited. You elevate us all with the quality of your DD.
2021-04-27 06:48:25,wallstreetbets,"And how many of us buy the double stuff... split 2... and make 1 quadruple stuffed oreo?

But though I do not know what causes the cold winds to blow when the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind, for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds. I see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of life, and I see that however much and however carefully I observe the hands of the watch, and the valves and wheels of the engine, and the oak, I shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing, the engine moving, or of the winds of spring. To do that I must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam, of the bells, and of the wind. History must do the same."" -Tolstoy"

2021-04-27 09:37:53,wallstreetbets,"Oreos are relatively cheap and popular. People have nostalgia for Oreos. When sales of Oreos drop, the company needs to change their product in an almost meaningless way, it's basically the same product with slight variation. 

This might be an indicator for reduced consumer spending that requires an almost surface level diversification of a simple product in order to maintain sales."

2021-04-27 10:53:11,wallstreetbets,"The correlation here is not likely a driver, but a market indicator. Traditional value-based marketing would lead Nabisco to over-compensate with its stuffing for... multiple possible reasons. The most obvious would be a sugar surplus, but that would mean markets are thriving. Can't be that, so maybe a competitor is driving innovation! We know however that Nabisco is one of the incumbents for the cookies market (along with Mars cookies) and likely has been for some time. If not one of the leading competitors, they would have gone out of business long ago.

Therefore, this only leaves a possibility that at the time of manufacture prior to releasing these new lines, the cocoa Futures Market is heavily inflated, which leads to a lower supply of cocoa than anticipated for the actual cookie. Since Nabisco plans batches ahead of time, they are likely left with a huge amount of stuffing ingredienrs (double the amount in fact) compared to cookies, and use this as an advantage to appear as if they are innovating with more stuffing in each cookie. 

The cocoa market is surprisingly volatile, as there are few sources from which it can be found and whenever One Source runs out of supply, many customers flock to the remaining sources to get what they need. In some ways the cocoa market likely holds up our economy; I don't necessarily know how other than the possibility of Valentine's Day and other holidays bringing in much revenue for the overall GDP but my point is this...

TLDR: Nabisco stuffing their Oreo cookies too much comes from a cocoa shortage, which is driven by market corrections and market crashes."

2021-04-27 11:36:21,wallstreetbets,So realistically we all need to sell before ultra stuffed becomes reality. These damn bears flooding the market with Oreos.

2021-04-27 11:08:42,wallstreetbets,I follow a girl on twitter who uses a mixture of technical analysis and astrology to predict movement in c-word currency. The first video I saw of her I thought was a joke but all of her content is the same analysis. And she knows what more about astrology then tech-analysis so most of her DD is based on it.
2021-04-27 15:21:54,wallstreetbets,I guess lol. I look up Oreo and this dude only listed like 7 out of hundreds of new cookie released because the ones he picked fit his narrative
2021-04-27 10:44:19,wallstreetbets,Is it insider trading if you let us know when/what the next planned oreo release is?

2021-04-27 16:35:45,wallstreetbets,Was game of thrones really THAT great after season 5? It seemed to really bog down in the story and plod along. I was never a huge fan of either the book or the series but I enjoyed watching the first couple seasons.

2021-04-27 08:49:02,wallstreetbets,like... I'm not going to lie... it makes sense. More stuffing appeals to a wider audience and would drive more sales thereby supporting their market price in an unstable market. Healthy Oreos and oreo minis don't appeal to as many people and are riskier decisions that they can afford to make in a more stable market.

2021-04-27 07:57:58,wallstreetbets,Yachty doesn’t do drugs tho
2021-04-27 09:39:35,wallstreetbets,Just “Lean Flavored”?

I really enjoy Oreo mcflurries with the pulverized bits"
2021-04-27 07:53:09,wallstreetbets,"It's just veggie shortening. Crisco, powdered sugar and vanilla flavoring. I've made it by the bowl this way and the flavor, texture and appearance is identical. I'm sure the factory adds some texturizers, stabilizers and preservatives that a home cook wouldn't need or have access to, but it's certainly not made of tallow. Also, if you want authentic oreo chocolate flavor in any of your deserts, buy Black cocoa powder, it is distinctly different than Dutch process or any other variety or cocoa powders."

2021-04-27 06:09:14,wallstreetbets,Might be worth it though.
2021-04-27 07:48:51,wallstreetbets,GME moves opposite of the market generally speaking.

2021-04-27 10:36:21,wallstreetbets,That's the nicest thing anyone has ever told me on WSB
2021-04-27 11:01:34,wallstreetbets,Someone down below said the double stuff is 1.85x the standard size

2021-04-27 19:20:03,wallstreetbets,"It is pure coincidence. It's slightly cherry-picked after the 1974 and 1987 dates. I just saw those when looking at the Oreo list and knew those two dates were market crashes from listening to Market Huddle interviews at work.

2021-04-27 19:33:17,wallstreetbets,(none of us do)
2021-04-27 08:11:33,wallstreetbets,But that didn't fit the narrative so I had to improvise
2021-04-27 09:11:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's very real. It's also true for beauty supplies. People spend more money on cheaper things that make them feel better when they can't spend large amounts on greater luxuries. WSB was about that when ULTA was a popular trade
2021-04-27 09:13:18,wallstreetbets,They do

And of course 2008 got kicked off due to a couple massively over leveraged entities blowing up, creating a counterparty risk crisis causing everyone to try to deleverage at once.

All three cases were due to overextension, but all three were kicked off by liquidity seizures and not direct, instant macroeconomic shifts"

It got bought out in 1997 according to Wikipedia, and ""The founders are no longer involved in the day-to-day operations, but still perform marketing duties and voice the radio ads.""

Maybe Tom and Tom sold out, or maybe they just folded to pressure from the corpos.  Who knows."

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Technicals Behind GameStop #5 Hello everyone,  
the price of the GameStop stock (GMEUSD) finally broke out of a sideways movement and is currently looking for new highs ($185.00 at this moment) in the pre-market. We are looking forward to the US market opening in \~4 hours. In order to be prepared for the undergoing trend-change, we are going to have a quick look on the chart.  


[https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/Bbhn1dBH\/](https://preview.redd.it/1i18187enov61.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b0b6345d359ec3fdb37790c3ea59a4b03438956)

The full chart is visible [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Bbhn1dBH/). We can see that the price was accumulating in a symmetrical triangle from March to this date. As soon as the price is hitting the demand zone (red channel), we see a strong reaction from the buyers on the market. While the sellers are preventing the buyers from making higher highs, we can also observe that the buyers support the price with higher lows - which results in the symmetrical shape.  
This is a simplification of how the buyers & sellers are acting on the market, and they are finally the ones who decide where the price is going next. The decreasing volume confirms this behavior. This breakout will drag more interest into the market, and we will see more price action (more volume).  


Now we're looking at a change of structure/ sentiment. The buyers were basically stronger than the sellers, and they managed to push the price above the previous high at $165.00, which is the first sign of an upwards trend. When we're looking at an upwards trend, we want to price to make higher highs and higher lows, supported by increasing volume. We want the market participants to confirm the breakout with trading action.  


Buyers & Sellers usually look for previous price peaks to either leave the market or to enter the market. So we can expect small retracements at the previous highs (horizontal lines), followed by further price movements towards the next high.  
This upwards trend is currently supported by the MA200 (grey line), which is a great entry for those wo might want to join the party.  


Have fun trading apes!"

Need to start doing wires early in the day I guess. Same reason I couldn't get in OTC with it yesterday for like half the price it is now."
2021-04-27 09:22:19,wallstreetbets,I have uncleared funds. Did an ACH instead of a wire yesterday like a moron... same reason I couldn't buy it OTC yesterday for much cheaper. Hopefully get in around the price it is now right at the bell. Waiting to leave for work to do that lol
2021-04-27 04:50:23,wallstreetbets,Bought it from otckmkts? Ibkr allows that.

2021-04-27 13:18:31,wallstreetbets,I bought at 5.70 at the bell. Learned a lesson lol but it will come back up. I think people that had bought a lot OTC have been selling to get profits. Then it will get going like it needs to

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD and SWOT Analysis on MindMed ($MNMD), a Psychedelic-based, Clinical-stage Pharma Company Applying LSD to Mental Health > Hey there /r/WallStreetBets! I'm a YouTuber with ~45k subscribers and I run a research-based stock DD channel. **In observance of Rule #6 on this subreddit's sidebar, and out of respect to the moderators and community here, I am not going to include a link to my channel.** I'm covering MNMD this week on my channel, and I have included a synopsis of the video here, including my SWOT Analysis. Let's have a good discussion!

**$MNMD (*Uplisting to Nasdaq on April 27th*)**

**PPS** $4.69

**Mkt. Cap.** $1.53B

**Shs. Out.** 326.13M

**Shs. Flt.** 286.28M

(*Source: Yahoo Finance, 2021/04/27 @0230EST*)


>At long last, Mind Medicine Inc. (MindMed) is getting uplisted from the OTCMKTS to the Nasdaq under the new ticker $MNMD. MindMed is a pre-revenue, clinical-stage pharma company that is undoubtedly the best pure-play in terms of psychedelics. Boasting international research collaboration and an extensive pipeline, this company is nothing if not novel and exciting. Its leading products include 18-MC, a safe Ibogaine derivative that can be used to treat addiction, and non-hallucinatory LSD Microdosing for the treatment of adult ADHD and anxiety. With a TAM far north of a conservative $30B, this company has a bright future. What’s going on with all the dilution? Why did the CEO and co-founder recently dump 56% (*Source: Simply Wall St., 2021/04/26*) of his shares? Is this actually a good investment?


***SWOT Analysis:***


**Strengths**


* First-mover pure play in the psychedelic pharmaceutical space.

* Social media and retail driven with retail investors holding over 93% of the shares outstanding.

* The war on drugs has officially ended and sentiment is more positive.

* Extensive pipeline with LSD Microdosing, 18-MC Ibogaine derivative, and many others.

* Minimal side effects of psychedelics; non-addictive.


**Weaknesses**


* Clinical stage company dependent on investors.

* No revenue, no income for 5+ years to come.

* Share dilution pending (CA$500M Shelf).

* Entire pipeline is based on Schedule-1 illicit substances.

* If first drug fails to gain FDA NDA in the future, casts doubt on the rest.


**Opportunities**


* Insane TAM at probably well over $30B. It’s tough to gauge the true TAM with mental health issues being under-reported.

* First-mover reputation and recognition.

* Novel treatment paradigms with psychedelics.

* International collaboration across US, Canada, and EU creates a wider net for possible approvals (even if conservative US FDA does not approve treatments).


**Threats**


* CEO and co-founder recently dumped 56% (*Source: Simply Wall St., 2021/04/26*) of his shares. Negative public perception from this.

* Always the possibility of funding issues if there are delays.

* Legal hurdles not being able to be overcome.

* Time is money. The timeline for this company is very, very long.


>**TL;DR** The reality is that this stock is 5+ years away from meaningful revenue and who knows how long from profitability. However, with one of the thiccest pipelines I've ever seen, retail holding >93% of the float, and psychedelics being literal social media bait, this is going to be one you're going to want to keep in your radar to trade on clinical news drops over the years.

2021-04-27 03:37:20,wallstreetbets,"My only concern is your estimation on share sale. If you’re looking at [his transactions](https://ceo.ca/api/sedi/?insider=Rahn,%20Jamon%20Alexander) you can see that he went from the equivalent of 10,000,000 subordinate voting shares to approximately 8,000,000 subordinate voting shares. A drop of 20% and not 50%.

Another note is the current shares outstanding, the 2020 MD&A shows that, on a fully diluted basis, we have approximately 400M shares outstanding.

2021-04-27 09:19:52,wallstreetbets,even if you could why? its already up 65% of offer price.  This has no where to go but down for short term.  Just look at COIN IPO that had so much more hype and big support.

The trump admin took a justified stance against opioids and particularly fentanyl and pushed an agenda that prioritized treatment, education, research into alternative methods of pain management, and community outreach. If the current admin is planning on discontinuing legislation penned under the last, that would be a net huge loss for America.

But you should also consider if its getting prescripted and you just can buy it (or speaking for countrys with healthcare insurance you get it for free) its way easier. You have to work quite sterile with growing mushrooms and you have to buy the materials and spores as well"

2021-04-27 09:10:14,wallstreetbets,"The War on Drugs wasn’t about opioids. OP is right in that Sessions rolled back Holder’s sentencing reforms under the belief that violent crime is reduced if you lock up people that have/use illegal drugs.

Edit: I disagree that the war on drugs is over but I take it OP meant it more broadly with Biden admin being more in line with Obama/Holder policies on mandatory minimums and non-violent drug crimes, as well as the shift with some states legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana, shrooms, etc."
2021-04-27 05:06:21,wallstreetbets,"yes but it is harder, you'll need a larger initial investment on equipment, more space, need to take better care of the conditions, there is the smell, etc. 

You can grow shrooms in the tiniest studio with negligible initial investment and nobody visiting you would ever notice and you'll have enough shrooms from one harvest to trip for a few years.

just saying, that I wouldn't invest into shroom productions, these companies need something else of value that they can sell imho. which some like Mindmed of course have, maybe even Numi i dont know them much. Was just commenting about OP being super psyched about a shroom growing facility."
2021-04-27 05:22:43,wallstreetbets,"yes of course i grow them myself, it's very easy. You don't need numerous procedures, unless you want to increase your yield to commercial quantities.

&#x200B;

Hate on whatever policy the man pushed you want, but he made some seriously good moves in the arena of drug policy reform. And criminal justice reform in general:   


Heavy promotion of the First Step Act - signed into law at the end of 2018  
[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/18/18140973/state-of-the-union-trump-first-step-act-criminal-justice-reform](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/18/18140973/state-of-the-union-trump-first-step-act-criminal-justice-reform)

Here are the major provisions of the [**First Step Act**](https://www.firststepact.org/about):

* The law makes retroactive the reforms enacted by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentences at the federal level. This will affect nearly 2,600 federal inmates, according to the [**Marshall Project**](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/11/16/what-s-really-in-the-first-step-act).
* The law takes several steps to ease mandatory minimum sentences under federal law. It expands the “safety valve” that judges can use to avoid handing down mandatory minimum sentences. It eases a “three strikes” rule so people with three or more convictions, including for drug offenses, automatically get 25 years instead of life, among other changes. It restricts the current practice of stacking gun charges against drug offenders to add possibly decades to prison sentences. All of these changes will lead to shorter prison sentences in the future.
* The law increases “good time credits” that inmates can earn. Inmates who avoid a disciplinary record can currently get credits of up to 47 days per year incarcerated. The law increases the cap to 54, allowing well-behaved inmates to cut their prison sentences by an additional week for each year they’re incarcerated. The change applies retroactively, which will allow some prisoners — as many as 4,000, according to supporters — to qualify for an earlier release fairly soon (although there have been some problems securing early release so far, [**thanks to how the legislation was written**](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2019/02/first-step-act-trump-confusion-good-time-credits/)).
* The law allows inmates to get “earned time credits” by participating in more vocational and rehabilitative programs. Those credits will allow them to be released early to halfway houses or home confinement. Not only could this mitigate prison overcrowding, but the hope is that the education programs will reduce the likelihood that an inmate will commit another crime once released and, as a result, reduce both crime and incarceration in the long term. (There’s [**research**](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR564.html) showing that education programs do reduce recidivism.)"
2021-04-27 05:51:43,wallstreetbets,"I think the key element to making these companies successful is both research and development into diminishing the harsh psychedelic experience, while maintaining the benefits of the medicine,  if they can even be uncoupled.  And, getting licensed therapists to nail dosages in supervised settings."
2021-04-27 11:21:11,wallstreetbets,"I was just trying to provide clarity to what the war on drugs was about and what OP may have been getting at. 

Regarding your latest comment, the AG, while appointed by the president and a member of the cabinet, is supposed to operate independently.

The bill you’re referencing got majority support from both republicans and democrats in the house and senate. He signed it after being pressured by his son-in-law and other advisers. Good on him for signing it. But it’s no secret that he ran as “tough on crime” and had the backing of private prisons. He also told Lopez Obrador that it was time to wage war against the drug cartels and the US would help Mexico wipe them out. Doesn’t sound like a guy who is against the war on drugs.

Millions more shares have been added for the hedgies to buy and cover their shorts. There's no squeeze. It's like there's people in this sub who want to propagate this lie in order to make people end up bag holding... which is fucked up.

It's still a good long-term play, and who knows, something weird and unexpected might happen to make the stock price go up sooner. Won't be due to a squeeze though."

2021-04-27 02:38:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they will likely do that, but even if they did a small dividend the shorts have to pay extra. I don't want a dividend, I want the shorts to have to pay my dividend, and for the company to invest. If I could only chose one it would be investment, but we will see what they do."

2021-04-27 05:17:31,wallstreetbets,Are you saying the hedge funds won't be paying approximately 710 trillion dollars(roughly 35 times the US gdp and 10 times world gdp) for all the GME shares?
2021-04-27 08:51:41,wallstreetbets,"Dunno how you got so many downvotes, you're not wrong lol

Wow a bunch of downvotes from a group of people who dont understand the mechanics of a short squeeze. 

News flash retards, just because your Google search for highest short interest returned AMC and RKT, that doesnt mean that theres a squeeze potential. They just, on that day, had the highest short interest. But not one of you asked yourself, is 20-30% short interest actually high? No, you didnt. You have no way to quantify or equivocate the low short interest and a short squeeze.

 I've asked this question a dozen times, why and how do you think you'll cause a short squeeze on a ticker that has tens of millions of shares not loaned out with which the short sellers can cover their positions?"
2021-04-27 06:21:36,wallstreetbets,Are you telling me the 178th straight “apes strong together” comment and calling any ticker that isn’t GME a distraction wasn’t bringing value to the sub?
2021-04-27 08:07:34,wallstreetbets,You call any article in relation to GME from CNBC valid?
2021-04-27 15:31:45,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand. Are you saying there can be ample shares on the market, and a short squeeze is still possible?

Or are you trying to say that the 8 Million volume is a tiny number of shares being traded thousands of times each?
We know the second one isn't possible, since GME dumped 3.5 million shares without dramatically affecting volume. If a small pool of shares made up most of the volume, any increase in supply would crash the price."
2021-04-27 14:06:22,wallstreetbets,Why do you think otherwise? All the GME stuff I've seen it shaky at best
2021-04-27 12:50:51,wallstreetbets,Do you think you're going to get millions per share without irony?
2021-04-27 08:10:21,wallstreetbets,"True. But there is good and bad news and there is most definitely believable news and the misdirection news from CNBC, Motley Fool."
2021-04-27 13:55:05,wallstreetbets,"Volume is when a seller finds a buyer, that counts as 1. So if I'm short and need to cover 8M shares that means it would take 1 day to cover if I was the only buyer. How can you squeeze with this volume? Please let me know."

2021-04-27 12:08:20,wallstreetbets,"Even if the shorts had to pay, that money used to pay a dividend is wasted as it is better spent making the company better.

2021-04-27 12:27:34,wallstreetbets,Considering they have lent out more shares than exist I do expect that to hurt short sellers substantially. You want a margin call? Increase the cost of holding their positions by releasing a dividend😵😵😵

2021-04-27 08:35:43,wallstreetbets,"If any company would use dilution as a source for dividend, any sane investor would question their choice of stock.   
   
EVEN IF GamesStop would do that to combat shorts, the cash they have on hand would hardly put a dent in shorts pocket. It's simple math, I believe you can do it yourself.   
   
They could issue $0.01 dividend just to fuck with shorts.    
    
Best use of GME's new stash of gold is to make their business better."
2021-04-27 15:36:11,wallstreetbets,You might be my new favorite. I love people that are completely wrong and then double down indignantly. I'll be following your investing career with great interest.

2021-04-27 12:32:37,wallstreetbets,But wouldnt they get dividend from Gamestop since they have the stock in hand? So it's just a transfer of dividend from Gamestop to short sellers to the actual owners.

With the cult following GME has right now, a lot of that dividend would end up reinvested into... GME shares."
2021-04-27 08:43:32,wallstreetbets,"Bro read my comments I don't disagree. They could also do a special one time dividend of $2 to thank investors for saving their company, and fuck the shorts. I will be happy either way."

&nbsp;      
EG does a dividend, as only 1 shares exist they expect to pay out only once to Johnny. But wait Timmy wants his dividend too, so who pays that? The person who went short does."
2021-04-27 13:02:08,wallstreetbets,"Most short sellers borrowed the stock and sold it immediately. They sold at market price thinking the price would drop. Those shares are on loan. If Gamestop did do a dividend, that money comes out of profits, but these short sellers have sold shares that belong to somebody else. That dividend belongs to the person who owns the stock, not the person shorting it. Shorts have to pay the dividend if they have the shares on loan. Gamestop pays once, but the shorts take it as a loss.

EG would give a dividend to Timmy as he is the person physically in possession of the share. Johnny would claim their dividend from the borrower"
2021-04-27 14:09:06,wallstreetbets,But the price of the stock would fall by the dividend amount so they wouldnt make a loss as a result of a dividend payout.

2021-04-27 15:27:10,wallstreetbets,Fair but in either way the point stands to the person I was replying too. The Short needs to cover one of the dividends. She was claiming the company should cover all dividends.
2021-04-27 11:28:24,wallstreetbets,"Personally I hate their eyes,

Slifer was adorable though."
2021-04-27 15:29:27,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree. I just wanted to clarify in case anyone was confused.

Though a lender can choose to waive the dividend. Its going to be up to each borrowing agreement"
2021-04-27 15:31:38,wallstreetbets,"Aren't a huge chunk of the borrowed shares done via retail that are using free platforms? For example I use Freeshare and Trading 212. Both state they can lend my shares, but I will still want my Dividends. I figure a this must account for a fuckton of the borrowed shares?"
2021-04-27 15:38:42,wallstreetbets,"It depends. AFAIK, if you have shares on margin, your broker is not obligated to pay dividends to you until you sell. If you have shares on cash, they shouldn't be able to lend them out in the first place but I know there's a weird gray area with Trading 212

If the broker is someone like Trading 212 that's making daily borrowing agreements with shorters, they may decide they like the continued premium on shorts more than they like the bulk dividend payment. They won't have to pay the dividends until after the squeeze anyway and if they're long, they'll have the funds to spot it after the squeeze

I'm not saying this is what they would do or even it makes sense for them, I'm just trying to illustrate a possible reasoning someone might waive dividends."

2021-04-27 11:17:42,wallstreetbets,I would be careful around uncle Bruce....
2021-04-27 02:39:30,wallstreetbets,"Me too, then sold at 22.80. Fucking paper hands"
2021-04-27 02:57:50,wallstreetbets,Sell tomorrow. Take 100+ gains
2021-04-27 08:09:34,wallstreetbets,45$ is a good estimate if we only hear lidar tech demo results higher if they mention it's specs blowing comp out of the water 80-100+ if they announce buy out. So you got plenty of room to grow this stock still
2021-04-27 01:58:15,wallstreetbets,Whatever you can afford to gain 300% over the next couple of months.
2021-04-27 10:16:29,wallstreetbets,It’s like I’m fucking cursed stock sky rockets and 5 min after buy in I lose thousands instantly same happened with GME
2021-04-27 09:05:40,wallstreetbets,Let’s goooooo
2021-04-27 02:56:27,wallstreetbets,"Don't chase. Triple C's.

Cool calm collected.

Buy blood baths."
2021-04-27 02:08:02,wallstreetbets,Exactly what I'm wondering. Don't wanna buy very high then it drops really quick.
2021-04-27 04:28:11,wallstreetbets,Not too late!!!
2021-04-27 09:13:06,wallstreetbets,Never to late
2021-04-27 01:54:10,wallstreetbets,"Don’t hate the rookie. My pops always told me “if you don’t have anyone hating you, you are doing it wrong”"
2021-04-27 01:45:05,wallstreetbets,Love to hear your support. Let’s ride this to the top together!
2021-04-27 09:07:37,wallstreetbets,Let’s see what you got! 💪
2021-04-27 09:06:13,wallstreetbets,🚀
2021-04-27 09:05:55,wallstreetbets,That’s awesome!!!
2021-04-27 09:39:10,wallstreetbets,I only had 180 but think about it like this. This can just be the initial investment that goes up a bit to give u alot to spend on the next moon
2021-04-27 01:47:12,wallstreetbets,No! MVIS is trending 8x GME ever was on Reddit. This thing is going to the MOON and then some!
2021-04-27 04:30:17,wallstreetbets,I question the same but it probably is. Those that says yes probably want to benefit off us
2021-04-27 09:07:06,wallstreetbets,💪
2021-04-27 04:28:37,wallstreetbets,$40 by end of day
2021-04-27 06:05:15,wallstreetbets,TIRX went straight from $90 to $14 wtf
2021-04-27 06:43:44,wallstreetbets,I got in TIRX as soon as I saw that big loss. I think the only direction is up 🤷🏽‍♂️
2021-04-27 01:54:57,wallstreetbets,I think you are still in a good spot to get in tomorrow. Join the ride! 🔥 💪
2021-04-27 05:30:35,wallstreetbets,Hold GME.. big day ahead!
2021-04-27 06:06:13,wallstreetbets,I think GME is going to have a great day today for sure but MVIS seems pretty hot to me
2021-04-27 08:54:41,wallstreetbets,MVIS without a doubt.  Thursday will be big so leading up to it keep accumulating!
2021-04-27 09:06:51,wallstreetbets,Just wait. Today is gonna be huge!
2021-04-27 09:52:41,wallstreetbets,He means tomorrow. But also nothing wrong with profit taking if you can. Just don't dwell if it continues one way or the other.
2021-04-27 04:54:16,wallstreetbets,Gme*
2021-04-27 08:29:51,wallstreetbets,Lol you think going down a little is dropping? GTFO you paper handed ninny
2021-04-27 09:19:05,wallstreetbets,"Your joking right?? For real man, I’m not sure how long you’ve been trading but it shows"

2021-04-27 03:13:20,wallstreetbets,But I’ll kick myself if it skyrockets!
2021-04-27 09:10:20,wallstreetbets,Downvoted by bagholders

2021-04-27 09:47:32,wallstreetbets,100 upvotes to you my friend !! I'm with you! Diamond hands here
2021-04-27 06:36:32,wallstreetbets,Ahahahh a lot of salty people downvoting everything mvis. Fkn losers stay salty biiiiiitch
2021-04-27 10:18:02,wallstreetbets,"This literally occurred 30 secs after I bought at $27. I'm locked in the Day Trade Limit now... so, I'm watching myself lose $1k and I can't do anything about it.

That day trade limit is really there to fuck over new traders by experienced ones. That's how the stock traders make their money."
2021-04-27 02:44:04,wallstreetbets,Same lol although I do think it will get to like 35$ realistically.
2021-04-27 09:13:29,wallstreetbets,It’s going to $60 today
2021-04-27 02:07:37,wallstreetbets,Sus
2021-04-27 02:41:16,wallstreetbets,Sus AF
2021-04-27 03:10:00,wallstreetbets,"Thank you sir, this made me “L-O-L”"
2021-04-27 01:51:26,wallstreetbets,I’m there to hold the line!
2021-04-27 06:15:43,wallstreetbets,"Ride to the top is the way. Quit selling off for a couple thousand when come Thursday you’ll be able to pay your house off. 
Wishful thinking over here."
2021-04-27 06:07:36,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it is too late to hop in yet, still waiting for the 29th"
2021-04-27 09:13:54,wallstreetbets,Let’s go to the moon apes!  Buckle ipup
2021-04-27 06:06:31,wallstreetbets,"To 11, it's flying all week now"
2021-04-27 06:44:52,wallstreetbets,"That is correct, it's a great day for a frosty!"
2021-04-27 09:24:45,wallstreetbets,Reapect ima hold out lowest ill let it droo is probably 24$ tho
2021-04-27 10:45:47,wallstreetbets,It's down almost 20% without any sign of a recovery
2021-04-27 09:04:30,wallstreetbets,Lol seriously. Why would anyone consider selling now? We’re just getting started
2021-04-27 11:33:05,wallstreetbets,Edward Paper Hands
2021-04-27 06:10:28,wallstreetbets,Got a link?
2021-04-27 17:40:45,wallstreetbets,Lol bagholders
2021-04-27 07:56:48,wallstreetbets,"Idk, just went up 100% in two days. Not outside the realm of possibilities"
2021-04-27 10:18:57,wallstreetbets,So fucking frustrating
2021-04-27 17:52:42,wallstreetbets,Switch to a cash account instead of margin
2021-04-27 03:12:15,wallstreetbets,"I don't know if this could be possible or not, but 40 dollars looking good."
2021-04-27 02:52:20,wallstreetbets,It will probably rise until 29. because of high expectations
2021-04-27 15:05:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah right, lol.so glad I didn't buy today"
2021-04-27 06:28:19,wallstreetbets,"Still holding 281,097 shares...this puppy isn't even close to its potential.  There is real buyout potential here, as stated by the CEO in multiple of its earnings calls...this is NOT just a squeeze opportunity!

It's highly likely that one of the big tech companies reporting earnings this week will be the one taking out MVIS.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)"
2021-04-27 12:07:06,wallstreetbets,Ever heard of volatility guy?
2021-04-27 09:39:59,wallstreetbets,Ppl start sweating losing like $100 in their dad’s Robin Hood account I guess.

2021-04-27 18:34:10,wallstreetbets,No balls
2021-04-27 08:00:22,wallstreetbets,"Yes but mvis is not like any other stock where after a 100% move it would be a good idea to sell. We are in the final stage of a buyout that most likely sends us above 100$, also even without a buyout the sheer buying volume from hype and also institutional investors combined with the shorts having to cover, all of this before the earnings calls on Thursday where they probably announce the Lidar demo completion can realistically send us to 60$ eow"
2021-04-27 11:51:15,wallstreetbets,Take it out then put in another app theyll give you a forced 90 days penalty for no trading but fucj it use new app did it and had to wait days to get it out but had tine to think about Lambos
2021-04-27 03:11:00,wallstreetbets,Definitely reaching 29. Its already 28.87 post market
2021-04-27 06:17:35,wallstreetbets,We’re past $29 in after hours.

2021-04-27 13:36:53,wallstreetbets,"Damn man, here I was thinking you only had a couple bucks on it. Alright then, if your holding out on 20 grand, I'm with ya."
2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,shout out to u/meiggs who accidentally bought 50k worth of GMED a month ago and is now up more than 15% 
2021-04-27 01:53:13,wallstreetbets,This reminds me of when I first tried to set a stop loss and accidentally sold for a  30% loss on a stock that was up 10% (though I didn't accidentally get any profits 😢)
2021-04-27 02:32:03,wallstreetbets,u/meiggs you've been summoned
2021-04-27 02:45:58,wallstreetbets,plot twist meiggs actually paper handed that's why he's so quiet
2021-04-27 03:11:47,wallstreetbets,"I've literally had GMED on watchlist since that post and damn, it's... not bad dude. Even that day, he was like ""ohhh I messed up"" and I was thinking ""you typed in the wrong ticker and still got +10% on the day"""
2021-04-27 01:37:01,wallstreetbets,"😂  we all messed up once or twice.  Glad his worked out!

🦍💎❤️💎🦍"

2021-04-27 06:22:26,wallstreetbets,"Hahahahahaha this was the funniest shit i’ve seen since i joined Reddit.
I just laughed out loud from being reminded of this beautiful retard"
2021-04-27 02:18:58,wallstreetbets,Legend.
2021-04-27 02:20:52,wallstreetbets,I'm glad it worked out! Lmao that shit was too funny though
2021-04-27 06:44:44,wallstreetbets,"Reminder that this guy is now and forever flaired as ""globus smoothus"""
2021-04-27 02:10:03,wallstreetbets,Hopefully he didn't sell at a loss
2021-04-27 02:10:49,wallstreetbets,Wish he held them
2021-04-27 01:44:42,wallstreetbets,Failed successfully! Buying GME a month ago would have them breaking even right now lol
2021-04-27 01:46:48,wallstreetbets,Is this the guy with the big fingers and pressed the wrong one lol
2021-04-27 06:00:06,wallstreetbets,Member this dude made me spit my coffee
2021-04-27 07:19:36,wallstreetbets,The comments on his post were fucking golden. I go back and look at it from time to time. Fucking hilarious. Always wondered how his play worked out.
2021-04-27 02:43:29,wallstreetbets,Good work king!
2021-04-27 06:41:17,wallstreetbets,Haha mine was clubhouse..... bought 2000 shares after talking to my girlfriend about investing and it wasn’t 3 days before I realized that I bought something totally different.
2021-04-27 07:35:44,wallstreetbets,"First time buying a contract.....thought I lost 1k.... 
Turns out it was exercised the following Monday morning.....so bought 100 more of AMC 😆"

2021-04-27 09:00:59,wallstreetbets,"used a market order to buy the wrong ticker. what a retard.

but why hold the fucking stock if you didn't mean to invest in it lol. at this point this sounds fake."
2021-04-27 15:34:29,wallstreetbets,"i remember that, priceless, lol'd for half hour"

2021-04-27 07:23:52,wallstreetbets,And that’s why you don’t sell at a loss 👍🏻
2021-04-27 07:25:34,wallstreetbets,Lol glad it worked out for him
2021-04-27 07:37:18,wallstreetbets,"Not bad, not bad"

edit:  where would they be if they'd actually bought GME that day?"
2021-04-27 08:06:05,wallstreetbets,YaSSSssS! I’ve been having shower thoughts about that dude. 💎🙌
2021-04-27 08:13:59,wallstreetbets,First time buying i bought the a company's B stock when I wanted the A stock and then it shot up 15% the following week.
2021-04-27 08:25:29,wallstreetbets,This is perfect! Congrats u/meiggs 🤣 Only a true retard could make money this way.
2021-04-27 08:26:55,wallstreetbets,"Lol, the ‘fat fingered’ gets me every time 😂🐒"

2021-04-27 08:49:44,wallstreetbets,lol
2021-04-27 09:01:53,wallstreetbets,there are no accidents
2021-04-27 09:11:07,wallstreetbets,Made more than me on real gme so far
2021-04-27 09:12:03,wallstreetbets,Probably the greatest story of all time on WSB.
2021-04-27 09:26:25,wallstreetbets,Mission failed successfully.
2021-04-27 09:26:29,wallstreetbets,Ahhh yes I remember when this happened!
2021-04-27 09:29:15,wallstreetbets,Hahaha.....I remember this!  Congrats!!
2021-04-27 09:31:01,wallstreetbets,Can happen to anyone 🙈
2021-04-27 09:33:17,wallstreetbets,Imagine the one who bought gmei before it mooned
2021-04-27 09:35:57,wallstreetbets,Stonks only go Up!
2021-04-27 09:39:16,wallstreetbets,Would have been up 100% if he had bought GME on 25 feb
2021-04-27 09:54:25,wallstreetbets,I remebered that! So funny 😅👏
2021-04-27 09:54:41,wallstreetbets,Legend
2021-04-27 10:04:02,wallstreetbets,This guy sold the next day though and made 1200 dollars what are you on about?
2021-04-27 10:40:36,wallstreetbets,Cash out and take that profit to buy the real GME!!
2021-04-27 11:06:40,wallstreetbets,First big lesson was Tesla. My friends no balls’d me to throw $25k in it...so I did. Was up $9k in a few days and I never sold. Held all the way to a negative where I sat for a month. Sold at break even hahahah.
2021-04-27 11:16:01,wallstreetbets,Same as Pinterest...
2021-04-27 11:40:05,wallstreetbets,"Retard ""accidentally"" buys 50K worth of stock in GMED and makes money and my TSLA 4/30 $800C not looking so good today.  Fuck..."
2021-04-27 11:43:15,wallstreetbets,"No way he held this, immediately panic sold the next day and lost it all on GME"
2021-04-27 11:50:34,wallstreetbets,"but if it was down 15%, wud u have still posted this??"
2021-04-27 11:54:01,wallstreetbets,I wonder if they held
2021-04-27 11:54:06,wallstreetbets,f
2021-04-27 11:56:21,wallstreetbets,Had fat fingers. Got fat pockets.
2021-04-27 11:57:26,wallstreetbets,Nah. Not GME don’t care
2021-04-27 12:22:04,wallstreetbets,Hahaha that was the fat fingered Ape I laughed at months ago!
2021-04-27 12:26:23,wallstreetbets,My favorite version of this from personal experience is selling options.  I sold some then days later wanted to close the trade...so I sold...which of course doubled my position instead of closing.
2021-04-27 12:28:24,wallstreetbets,nice but he'd be up 80% if he had correctly bought gme
2021-04-27 12:33:09,wallstreetbets,Hahaha
2021-04-27 12:36:39,wallstreetbets,Life finds a way.
2021-04-27 12:38:03,wallstreetbets,Respectable mistake.
2021-04-27 12:54:59,wallstreetbets,Same energy as the guy buying palantir calls in hopes to lose money to gain internet fame but instead makes money on their biggest day jump in a while.
2021-04-27 13:31:15,wallstreetbets,Fuck! Why don’t my fat fingers ever accidentally buy moon stonks!
2021-04-27 13:37:04,wallstreetbets,"I remember seeing that!  Fat-fingered the trade and bought GMED instead of GME.

What a happy accident!  Well played, sir."
2021-04-27 14:09:45,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-27 14:33:42,wallstreetbets,Making money on accident is so wsb.

2021-04-27 17:34:08,wallstreetbets,This is how you retard properly.  Always fail up.
2021-04-27 18:00:34,wallstreetbets,He’s be up like 70% on GME though :/
2021-04-27 18:19:43,wallstreetbets,"I have thought about this guy often over the last few weeks, glad to see that worked out in his favor."

2021-04-27 19:23:04,wallstreetbets,"Woooooohoooooo a measly 15%.

I thought we weren't allowed to post dumbshit pittance gains like this..."
2021-04-27 19:34:41,wallstreetbets,"That post had me laughing so hard.

I wonder if he kept it."

2021-04-27 04:35:35,wallstreetbets,"lol  


I've just set my first stop few minutes ago and had concerns about that exact thing. Wasnt sure if I'm doing it right. Glad it worked out."
2021-04-27 07:12:21,wallstreetbets,How is that even possible? The lowest you can sell for is the current market bid price?
2021-04-27 05:05:56,wallstreetbets,This happened to me more times than I care to admit. Not for those amounts luckly. Well now I just always check everything.
2021-04-27 06:58:42,wallstreetbets,That exact thing happend to me when I first tried to set a stop loss. I was so freaking mad. You're not alone.
2021-04-27 09:22:57,wallstreetbets,I did this the first time I sold an option contract. It was up 50% and I accidentally sold for what I bought it for

2021-04-27 02:58:09,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha i did the same somehow I sold my 130€ worth per share for 120€ how ever I managed that. Should have read more dd‘s and ate few more crayons.
We all learn hopefully."
2021-04-27 09:18:53,wallstreetbets,"Whoa.  Which broker?  My broker (fidelity) automatically gets me a better price if one is available. 

In fact, often times on options with wide bid/ask, I’ll sometimes hit the bid or the ask (depending on which side of the trade I’m on) just to see what happens. Usually I get a price improvement to somewhere in the middle...which makes no sense to me.  How’d they find that price if there was no bid or ask to go with it?"
2021-04-27 06:48:12,wallstreetbets,Dude. Did the same was up maybe 6k? On some RCL calls tried the get the most for my contracts so new trader in me did the market sell.... mannnnn worst decision ever ended up selling for only 2k profit maybe 😭

2021-04-27 09:50:40,wallstreetbets,Yesterday I accidently sold a stock I was trying to buy. It went up like 30% EOD and it took me too long to realize what I had done.
2021-04-27 09:59:13,wallstreetbets,How did this happen??? I never have stop loss in place.

2021-04-27 07:49:07,wallstreetbets,Proof that this is in fact a casino.
2021-04-27 11:03:16,wallstreetbets,Ironic part is.. Had he got GME he'd have lost 40% of it lmao and instead he's up 15%.
2021-04-27 10:29:05,wallstreetbets,"he got 10% on the day because of his mistake though, it became so popular here and made headlines and apes followed suit."
2021-04-27 12:52:25,wallstreetbets,It happens all the time. People got the wrong zoom stock and it went up way more than the real one.

2021-04-27 08:58:07,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I avoid stop loses on anything with high volatility. If there's a big dip and rebound there's a risk of getting stopped out at a loss."

2021-04-27 10:11:05,wallstreetbets,Isn't that the whole purpose of the best price rules? Even if you sell for $0.01 if market is $1 your supposed to fill at market? I could be wrong but many times my sell limits would fill above what I actually set I always chalked it up to best price obligations.
2021-04-27 09:26:53,wallstreetbets,Market hours but otherwise I think so. Was awhile ago now but that's my best guess. Or a quick pullback at the exact moment. The thing went up 35 more cents after too. 🙃
2021-04-27 16:30:56,wallstreetbets,Had I ever tried fake money trading! Unfortunately it was my first green stock and I was excited to lock in some gains and left about 65 cents x 200 shares on the table.

2021-04-27 08:22:49,wallstreetbets,"UBS? A stock with no history of ever breaking $25 yet you thought it would triple because of a Reddit post? Meanwhile USB actually did go from $40 to $57?

Sounds like USB was the actual play and UBS would've been the typo."

2021-04-27 15:30:18,wallstreetbets,I had 222 shares of gme in December and sold the next day at a loss can't believe how I apish I was without even knowing what wsb was yikes 😅

2021-04-27 08:07:20,wallstreetbets,Your broker should still try to get you the best price available.  Unless you are using robinhood.
2021-04-27 16:49:33,wallstreetbets,"You should never ever use market orders for options. It's one of the first things anyone should learn when wading into options. Limit orders to buy, limit orders to sell. Options contract bid/ask spreads can be wild.

Yes options limit orders will fill at the limit you set. That doesn't stop you from setting a stupid limit and essentially making it a market order."
2021-04-27 11:32:16,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
2021-04-27 12:30:33,wallstreetbets,"Stop loss is just automated paper hands, why would anyone want that?"
2021-04-27 10:18:22,wallstreetbets,What if no one has a buy order that low? Does it still execute on the next lowest and split the difference or something? Or just sits there
2021-04-27 06:39:16,wallstreetbets,What is this l e a r n i n g ?
2021-04-27 12:00:44,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I think that highly depends on the broker/platform.

A proper platform will take your buy order of 10€ and fill it with the best available price, so usually you pay a little less. Or if it can't be filled it adds it to the order book.

Most ""free"" platforms don't send your order directly to market but to an intermediate party (e.g. Robinhood and citadel). This party then decides if they want to fill the order or send it to the marketplace. So if the highest sell order is 9.50€ and you place a buy order for 10€, they fill that order by buying the 9.50€ themselves and pocketing the 0.50€ difference.

It is this that makes ""feeless"" broker apps often more expensive than brokers that just charge a % fee."
2021-04-27 14:46:14,wallstreetbets,I'll be down in June to round you boys up.

2021-04-27 16:33:01,wallstreetbets,Currently hold 132 so 🤷‍♂️
2021-04-27 10:11:03,wallstreetbets,"It probably won't, you'll need someone to eat through the entire ask part of the book to get to you and then STILL pick up your options. It's highly unlikely."
2021-04-27 08:33:44,wallstreetbets,"I literally had no idea one could do this. So if a stock is at 100 on the market, and you punch in ""limit 10"".... It will sell at 10?"
2021-04-27 15:32:39,wallstreetbets,Sometimes when I'm bored I'll put in buy orders on high premium but super low volume options that are going to be itm at expiration just to see if someone accidentally puts out a market order to sell.
2021-04-27 08:15:16,wallstreetbets,Hahaha that would be a nice surprise
2021-04-27 08:14:02,wallstreetbets,What’s the benefit in that for RH? It seems like they literally try to get you the highest price when you buy and lowest price when you sell without limit orders.
2021-04-27 11:41:05,wallstreetbets,Good save on the RH comment....
2021-04-27 13:04:41,wallstreetbets,"Sayings “what if no one has buy order that low” doesn’t make sense logically. Any buy order is already the max. Meaning that’s the limit the buyer is willing to pay. So in this sense, if you put in a sell limit at massively lower than the buy limit, you are saying “look I am willing to sell this for x or higher” and the buyer is saying “ok I’m willing to buy at y or lower”. Meaning that the lowest sell bid that crosses the highest buy bid will execute at mid price."
2021-04-27 11:49:59,wallstreetbets,I also want the answer to this

2021-04-27 11:40:33,wallstreetbets,"Well, when you’re talking about Buffett-scale money, you never need to sell anything but a miniscule percentage (if any) to live comfortably. If you have $100M invested, and it goes up 1%, that’s a million bucks. Personally, I could probably manage on that much income per year."
2021-04-27 08:43:15,wallstreetbets,If you sell with limit 10 it will accept any price higher than 10 and will just execute at market price most likely. It will only go below market if the bid ask spread is wide which is often the case with low volume options
2021-04-27 09:43:51,wallstreetbets,I am near certain the broker is legally obligated to get the most money possible for your shares regardless of what you set your limits at
2021-04-27 13:00:53,wallstreetbets,"Only if the other person does a market buy. Other wise you’ll mostly likely rerouted to the closest limit buy. 

This is why market orders are always a gamble in low volume- you don’t know if it’s gonna get filled at average price or some how 200% over the actual price."
2021-04-27 08:27:59,wallstreetbets,"RH doesn't care if you make money or not. But the people they sell your data to care. The implication being, RH sells your order flow to Citadel. Citadel sets a counter order at the right price. Your order gets matched with theirs without ever going to market.

When you trade on RH, you're not trading with the market, you're trading in a sandbox where the prices are higher. It's like trying to buy a fair price hotdog at a baseball stadium. They've been fined multiple times by the SEC for failing to give proper price improvement.

But it's still hard to believe that an order would be something like 35% below the asking price. Normally they just nickel and dime you, but this is like Benjamin-ing you.

A few possibilities I can think of:

1. He lost money but only because they stop loss didn't trigger at the price he was expecting it to when it executed. So it went up 10%, then down 30%.
2. He created a stop loss with a limit price too close to the stoping price. So when it dropped, it left his order in the dust.
3. He was trading something (options or stocks) with insanely low volume or very high spread. Causing a massive lost (Could happen with options, but still unlikely).
4. Robinhood/Citadel really did a number on his order's price improvement. If this is the case, and he lost any type of real money. He could absolutely sue if his order really sold for 40% below the market value at the time. Order limit or no.
5. OP is lying or misleading."
2021-04-27 08:18:09,wallstreetbets,"They make their income from selling order flow data. So one of their customers, like Citadel, can see your order before the rest of the world. They can then front-run your order, ensuring that you don't get the best price."
2021-04-27 18:48:35,wallstreetbets,Yup that's the guy!
2021-04-27 18:24:38,wallstreetbets,"Yea I can't remember either, i just vaguely remember two accounts that were ""battling"" and one was water and one was fire, and people kept summoning the one guy but he was out of town for like a week with no internet service."

2021-04-27 11:58:54,wallstreetbets,"Most money possible is market price if you set limit below the market price. However, if there is no volume and the bid-ask spread is wide, it will execute at ur limit price."
2021-04-27 13:04:12,wallstreetbets,Makes sense thanks.
2021-04-27 09:25:19,wallstreetbets,"Sort of #3

There must have been a bid that matched my limit order and a high bid ask spread at that moment, or a pullback.

2021-04-27 09:40:43,wallstreetbets,"If it's an option, never trade low volume options if you plan on selling the option and not exercise/get assigned. That's the most common way that spreads eat new traders. Spreads on stocks are normally not as bad, but the spread on options are multiplied by 100. And low volume options can sometimes have spreads of $0.10 - $0.30"

I don't believe them for shit but scrolling through the posts, there is a shitload of MVIS talk and the dude in the video seems genuine, not talking shit about the Reddit community and actually says that the Apes are looking at more than their usual bullshit, the Apes are talking about the Tech behind MVIS.

First time poster here, no clue if this post will be allowed. I am thankful to the Wallstreetbets community for making me a shitload of tendies and then making me lose most, and then making them back and losing some and then making a shit load more. The question is, is it too late hop on MVIS rocket. Are you still in this galaxy?"
2021-04-27 03:18:25,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think it’s too late. But what do I know, im just a retard thats still holding GME after buying in at $315 although I have averaged down to $178."

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I’m long on TLRY At this point in time, the cannabis industry is still in its infancy. There are over 60 large cannabis companies competing for the largest market share, and the race to have the greatest presence is only beginning.

Tilray, which currently ranks 3rd in the list of the largest cannabis companies in the world, already has an incredible amount of leverage over the majority of its rivals. After the mega-merger with rival company Aphria, Tilray will overtake both Curaleaf and Canopy Growth in terms of revenue, making it the largest cannabis company in the world.

In an industry that has not even begun to reach its formal formation, infrastructure and revenue are by far the most important traits a company can have. Tilray, which will own dozens of diverse subsidiaries after its Aphria merger, has a global presence in over 18 countries:

 r/TLRY - Tilray Supply Locations
Tilray Supply Locations
Although a portion of these countries only allow hemp-related products and/or clinical trial exports, the infrastructure is still there. Tilray has a massive global presence, giving it a launchpad to build its brand name and form agreements across the world. Although companies like Curaleaf, Trulieve and Cronos Group already have market share in the U.S, Tilray's strategy of aggressively expanding its operations on a global scale will prove to be the most successful method in dominating the industry. It allows for long-term growth, that can adapt to the endless demand for cannabis in the future of our society.

And that's not to say Tilray doesn't already have infrastructure in the United States. Currently, Tilray owns the goliath hemp-food company Manitoba Harvest, the world's largest hemp food manufacturer which has products in over 16,000 retail stores globally. In addition, Tilray will own SweetWater Brewing Company, a popular brewing company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, after the Aphria merger this quarter. Not only do both companies offer a steady stream of revenue, but they provide an opportunity for U.S exposure once federal legalization occurs. In addition, Tilray's diverse brand segmentation will allow them to generate revenue from a broad range of sources.

In the coming years, attitudes towards marijuana will drastically change. It's been almost a decade since Colorado and Washington legalized cannabis in 2012, and since then 16 states have followed. If expectations are met, the federal prohibition on marijuana could end as early as this year. With government support and an overwhelming increase in positive views towards legalization, it's only a matter of time until cannabis will become a destigmatized substance integrated into adult society.

 r/TLRY - U.S public opinion on legalizing marijuana
U.S public opinion on legalizing marijuana
The legal marijuana industry is only beginning. Worldwide legalization and embracement will take years or decades to reach, but when it does, cannabis will be a universally accepted substance with an endless demand. After the Tilray/Aphria merger this quarter, it will become clear which company has the greatest chance of capitalizing off this rapidly expanding industry.

Long on TLRY and APHA."
2021-04-27 02:05:43,wallstreetbets,"Marijuana legalization is supported by 70% of the American population, it's inevitable at this point. The European flood gates are about to open as well and Tilary has a massive market share and early mover advantage in Europe."

2021-04-27 13:24:18,wallstreetbets,Right just like groceries... lol because Walmart only carries produce from my home town. Joe from down the street has to deal with a totally I know logistics chain. I’m pretty sure large corporations can streamline that chain as well as offer quality control.

Joe will even toss you an O if you help him drop that 350 in his civic. Now sure, not everyone knows Joe, but when you start smoking the devils lettuce it's not long before you run into your very own friend Joe. 

Mind you, this whole time there are warehouses absolutely filled to the tits with wacky tobaccy. Drier than a witches fart and getting dryer by the day. Sure, it's worth what they say it is, ain't it?"

You can grow great chronic for roughly 600 bucks depending on your particular climate. That 600 + 100 operating cost can easily yeild you 1/2 lbs every 2 months relatively easily.

You can brew crap for 700 bucks. Decent microbrews are very expensive, and labour intensive."
2021-04-27 02:00:12,wallstreetbets, False equivalency. Brewing beer is more complicated and easier to render impure than weed.
2021-04-27 12:41:54,wallstreetbets,"Its limited right now, cannabis as a legal product is new, lots of people dont understand anything more than thc%.

You can grow any strains you choose, even the sativa strains that aren't economical for the big guys. You wont care, after a year of growing you will have far more than you need. Who cares if real G13 takes an extra month and a half for half the yield. 

Right now people go to the dispensaries but everyday more and more people are realizing that legal weed is not worth $10/g. Prepackaged, mistreated, super dry. Why do you think they push concentrates? It's far easier to package and control. Sure it was great chronic, but they ruined it with rules then made shatter. The industry is set up by idiots. Just check how busy your local hydroponics place is.

My biggest fear is access. There is currently no way for small local producers to operate. No legal way to participate. As cannabis matures as a product, more and more people will look elsewhere for higher quality at lower cost (buy local).

I'll wait to invest, the market we have now is just wrong. Anyone who appreciates quality smoke can tell you that. I'm a no body, and I could fix the industry."

2021-04-27 02:28:31,wallstreetbets,"You know its interesting.

  I cant seem to find a limit to the amount of beer I can personally brew at home. Maybe it exsists, but I cant find a number of gallons that if I brew 1 more I could be in trouble. 

I'm allowed 4 plants, no more. 

Strange how that works."
2021-04-27 12:45:44,wallstreetbets,"Sorry for my crappy English but I believe your argument still fails as, in Colorado for instance you can only grow one plant that’s it that does not produce enough for one person to smoke for a whole year and so what I was trying to say is they have to buy from dispensaries and thus tlry is in perfect position to capitalize, get these stocks why they cheap, moonshine was great too Till jack daniels got involved same difference so accepting the vision of the future for what it is and capitalize on it"
2021-04-27 04:56:17,wallstreetbets,"Must not know how to Google. Lol. Took me about 30 seconds to find that the limit is 100 gallons of beer or wine per year, or in a household with more than 1 adult, 200 gallons provided none is sold."
2021-04-27 13:03:04,wallstreetbets,"Google cannabis lbs plant. It's pretty fun to grow a lbs on a single plant. It's not easy, but its doable with amature experience.

Also if you could have 1 plant at a time, that's means 6 plants over the entire year provided you illegally veg a replacement for your flower room and have a 2 month cycle. Or 3 plants without a vegatative plant and a 4 month cycle.

Let's say you only get a half lbs plant. That's still 1.5 lbs a year. 650 grams for a year is probably enough unless you are a chronic smoker. 

This is all indoor too, if we included things like greenhouses or outdoor the numbers get way worse for dispensaries.

At the end of it the problem is beer is not a plant. It's made from plants, but you can't directly grow beer."
2021-04-27 10:57:53,wallstreetbets,"Are you sure? 100 gallons isnt a lot. That's like 6 half barrel kegs. What would be the point?

If you like beer, and you start brewing beer. You will still have to buy beer.

If you like weed, and you grow weed. You dont have to buy weed. You can even give it away without really noticing."
2021-04-27 13:07:20,wallstreetbets,"Indoor yes but you ain’t taking into account electrical costs for high pressure sodium lamps and soil mediums set up hydroponics etc. so all these things are barriers to entry and also you are forgetting the biggest point people are lazy it is convenience, why you think we still got so many 7-11 cuz it’s convenient! People know products over priced and what not but they still use them. But let’s consider your scenario, chronic smokers would still need more and they like to smoke different bud every day not just the ones they are growing, growing al the different buds takes time and therefore it is more convenient to buy at the dispensary case closed bud this the future get the stocks why they cheap"
2021-04-27 13:01:49,wallstreetbets,Not disagreeing with you that it's not a lot. Just saying what 27 C.F.R. §25.206 says.
2021-04-27 13:22:02,wallstreetbets,"I'm not. I said you can set up for around $600 with a $100 per month operating. That cover everything you bring up as well as many others. Now it might be a little low if you live in a area with high electricity  cost, but it's really not that bad. 600w for 12h a day isnt bad, hottubs cost more. So the barrier of entry is about what someone might spend on weed in two months anyway.

As for lazy, growing weed is lazy man. You mostly sit there watching it grow. The plant grows on it's own, you just provide the atmosphere. I could set you up with a garden that would take you a hour labor a week, I can automate 90% of the process too.

I've already answered different strains. I currently have 11 strains. After growing for a bit you can have as many as you want. Growing different bud takes no more work than growing the same bud again.

If your buying for the short term, to get some tendies from the hype then great. If you think these companies are +10 year investments, I think your loony."
2021-04-27 13:09:16,wallstreetbets,"That's very surprising but of course there is a limit. I'm surprised at it being 100 gallons. 

Even if you were a brewmaster and wanted to spend the tens of thousands on equipment. You still couldn't be the guy who gives beer to all his friends. 

Grow weed, everyone will love you when you can toss around ounces."
2021-04-27 13:33:17,wallstreetbets,"Man I think you looney cuz you don’t seem to understand how lazy people really are, you motivated most people are not and especially pot smokers they the laziest I have ever seen, your strains take time you say 11 dispensaries offer hundreds of strains man so the money you are talking about is quite a bit! Plus a lot of people don’t have the space to dedicate in their houses to grow, screw tendies man I want the whole safe!"
2021-04-27 13:49:59,wallstreetbets,"Well, sure people are lazy. So people might resent the fact that they spend money every month on something they light on fire. People had to work for that money, why trade it for something you can produce yourself better, cheaper, easier. It's a weed! You can have everything you need delivered to your door, sometimes already set up.

I could have hundreds of strains, I dont because that's stupid. I've been smoking my whole life, there just isnt enough genetic variation to justify having hundreds of strains. I do grow something different most cycles.

If you want the safe, wait until there is a Avenue for local producers to sell locally. Then buy that.

I will say this, no one wants bubblegum anymore, but if you call it swicky all of a sudden, it's different right? That's how the legal industry operates.

If 1 in 20 have a 4'x4' flower garden, those other 19 dont need a dispensary."
2021-04-27 14:26:54,wallstreetbets,"People will continue to be lazy and though you have taken initiative which is great you still do not understand that an avenue for local producers to sell locally will not allow for a profitable business model, that is akin to a farmers market, is that your idea of investing? come on man you cant be serious, if your argument is true then all local breweries would be blowing out the big companies out the water this is not what's happening look at SAM it is taking off and tlry will do when the US market opens up"
2021-04-27 15:38:56,wallstreetbets,"Nah, you still cant understand that this is a different product. It's not like anything else we have models for. Im happy to challenge  your investment ideas, I'm not sure you understand the physical limitations of the product or how its produced. 

Local producers will be profitable and as people realize the quality is leagues better they will vote with money. My setup cost more than $700, but I currently grow for about $1.60/g, you can decide if there is room for profit. 

Do you have any idea how much weed is currently sitting in warehouses? None of it is any ""good"" and yet it still reflects value. Why? Because enough people dont understand yet that chronic neglected for even 2 weeks is garbage. It's not beer, you cant just bottle it and expect a quality product when its opened. It need to be cured until its consumed, prepackaged product makes that impossible.

You want to find the organization that  enables local producers to sell product. It doesn't exsist now, but it will. Eventually people will get sick of the step backwards in quality legalization has created. 

Sell me bud, you belive in the current industry, why? Just because you think growing is hard? It's not, and as more people meet Joe and realize they can grow like Joe, less people will want the prepackaged garbage weed."
2021-04-27 16:58:17,wallstreetbets,"Dude this is why people like you are ignorant because I you assume whoever you are speaking to is ignorant with your comments, “I’m not sure you understand”, oh I understand more then you can even imagine dude  and what I know is people are lazy and chronic is still chronic and people actually enjoy smoking dry weed that has been prepackaged contrary to your argument  your setup cost is high for someone who would rather spend the 700 on bud, people don’t want to grow local because it’s better quality they grow local to save a little bit of money, but you don’t think big companies like tlry can’t produce it for cheaper then 1.60 a g you are on Mars, all the weed sitting in warehouses is great because people will smoke it man they been smoking Mexican weed for decades like dude this stock is so cheap right now it’s time to take in the fact that what you think is better is not what the general public will think and because you have no vision outside your preconceived biases you will never see the future"
2021-04-27 18:06:20,wallstreetbets,"Hey, dont knock my setup man. I have the rolls Royce of setups. Yes I spent more, but let's face it bud. 

I have ""not"" made tens of thousands in profit on my setup. That would be illegal. Lol. /s"
2021-04-27 17:44:30,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I didnt mean to offend. There are certainly lots of areas I'm not familiar with. Still im very careful investing in things I dont understand.

  I do find the idea that people enjoy bone dry product questionable. I have never seen a dehydrated prepackaged bud win a cup or award.

Of course they can produce cheaper, but the waste is extreme. They might sell 1 out of 10 grams they produce. That's why there are warehouses full of product being ignored until its garbage.

People smoked ditch weed because the alternative was being arrested growing cannabis. You couldn't just order your equipment and seeds online. You couldn't buy clones at the store. Now you can.

My theory is the general public with get more and more knowledgeable about cannabis as the market matures. Also that a simple regulation change could destroy the companies currently producing. Their current value only exsists due to regulations. The only thing stopping the regulatory change is not enough people realize they are getting f'd. 

Honestly, my vision of the future is better than yours. But that doesn't make it right."

I have a question for the believers.

In 1990 a gram of weed cost $10.

In 2021 a gram of weed cost $10.

Can you name any other product whose price has been exactly the same for 31 years?"
2021-04-27 19:29:38,wallstreetbets,You are forgetting all the factors at play. 10/ g in the 90s is alot. It was dirt weed back in the 90s so its not apples to apples. Then we have to account for the fact that dispensaries don't get raided by the cops like we used to in the 90s.
2021-04-27 19:43:14,wallstreetbets,"Nice. Great thought.

Well, depends where you got it I suppose. I was smoking great weed in the 90's. The cops were awful back then and it was way harder to grow indoor. Getting a grow light in small town Canada in the 90's was a feat in itself. You had to build everything, from whatever parts you could find. Dont even get me started on actually finding decent genetics without a trip to Amsterdam. Legalization is worth it just for how much easier everything is now.

So does the price stay $10 because of efficiency? Exactly $10 bucks? No inflation,  no drop from legalization, just never change your price for 30 years?

It's crazy... Fine I'm buying some. I like crazy."
2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMZN split possible this Thursday. Call fam unite! 🚀🌕🦍 If true this would be huge. [https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544](https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544)

Technically it looks like a 5-star set up on a chart heading into their earnings day this Thursday. Been in a channel for 8 months. Sitting at ATH's right now waiting for a reason to break out. A big earnings beat sends it higher or a split sends it higher. 

If there's a 6 to 1 or more split I bet we see +10% Friday even on average earnings. If we get an earnings beat plus a split then we're talking a once in a lifetime move for a biz their size - maybe 50% gains in the 1-2 months. Last time it consolidated this long it doubled in a leg up in 2-3 months. If they don't have numbers that get them there they will likely play the Split card. They know they need a breakout after the last 8 months and with a new CEO. Their last earnings was actually amazing but the stock didn't go because of the Bezos news. A big reason its stalled is the fact that it's 4k freaking dollars. A split means retail can jump in on shares & call options.

I follow lots of hedge fund guys on Twitter and they're all sharing the same article of this hedge fund guy Bill Miller saying AMZN will double in Barron's and they're all just waiting for a reason to send it higher. [https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311](https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311)

If there's an earnings beat then over the next few weeks analyst after analyst will trip over each other upgrading their PT's which'll also send it higher. Analysts don't downgrade AMZN. They either keep their previous ratings or they upgrade. [https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast)

If we get any kind of good news Thursday I think we have $4k upside in the next month at least.

I've done a lot of time doing DD on this and I think it's a rate 5-star situation so I wanted to bring it to the fam. 🦍 Would suck if I got rich/poor without you.

I think calls are the move since we're either in for sideways or 🚀🌕. 

I'm thinking **June 4 @ $4,000 strike** for price / expiry. 

Going to war tomorrow. Would love to have fam beside me. What say you?

UPDATE --
i just looked at the last 45 earnings for amazon, and compared price day of to 5 weeks later.

16% of the time, amzn's stock price increased >15%. 84% of the time amzn's stock did not increase by >15%. Among the times that amzn saw a 15%+ increase over the following 5 weeks post earnings, the average gains was 19%.

Something to keep in mind if you wanna buy a call option. Historically we've seen big gains 16% of the time following earnings for AMZN."

If they miss earnings it will go down because of obvious reasons. If they beat earnings it will go down, because everyone expect them to beat earnings. (see i.e. Tesla) If they don’t announce a split it will go down. If they announce a split it might go higher but not by much. 
Might even open a short position on thursday."

2021-04-27 10:13:20,wallstreetbets,"Since i wrote that initial comment at the ass crack of dawn, I'd like to elaborate. 

The question we must ask is what is the purpose of this stock split? 

1. Amazon wants to be included in the Dow jones. Since this is a price weighted index, not a market cap weighted index, Amazon would need to split into the $200 range hence a split of roughly 15:1. 
2. On the other hand, Amazon could just split otherwise theyll turn into a Berkshire Hathaway type of stock with massive share price. This is also possible but Jeff Bezos is not a fan of stock splits to appeal to retail investors, the last stock split for AMZN was in the late 90s. 

Regardless, any sort of split would be huge for amazon."

2021-04-27 16:08:33,wallstreetbets,"Basically - If you had 1 share today, and there was a stock split, then tomorrow you would have 6 shares, or however many is announced. However, the value per share drops because the split increases the number of outstanding shares which dilutes the value of each share. This means today you have 1 share worth $3400 but tomorrow 6 shares worth a combined value of $3400, or about $567 a share. There are various reasons a company would want to do this.  
It is also possible for a company to do a reverse split where some number of shares become 1. This drives up the cost per share because there are less shares to be had."
2021-04-27 16:11:03,wallstreetbets,If an announced split was 6 to 1 then you would have six times the number of shares after the split each worth 1/6 of the pre split value.

2021-04-27 02:01:41,wallstreetbets,If things work out I'm hoping for a multi week run so yeah if that happens there would be more gains ahead if you're buying shares. If you're buying calls tho it's better to buy pre news than post news.
2021-04-27 15:01:06,wallstreetbets,I love it. You fucking kill me 🤣🤣🤣
2021-04-27 13:47:54,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Undervaluation doesn't matter in the short term, but it does make analysts more likely to come out with high PT's that pump the stock a bit.

I think it has a decent chance to take a big leg up over the next few weeks, but it'll depend on earnings & whether we get a split. Average earnings + no split and it'll continue to basically track the market."
2021-04-27 01:48:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it's uncertain, like everything. The reason I'm betting is the risk/reward looks extremely asymmetric to the upside.

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cannabis companies Aphria (APHA) and Tilray (TLRY) merging to form largest cannabis company. Thoughts? https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731348/000119312520318610/d74024dex991.htm

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/tilray-lowers-the-bar-for-merger-with-aphria-51618603961

Ok so here’s the deal. In the past cannabis has been thought of the next gold rush. That everyone should get “green” stocks now because it’s gonna explode. Whether they did or not back in 2018 when it was new and cool I don’t know I farted away. 

Thinking back now I’ve came across some findings. APHA and TLRY are beginning to merge. APHA got their shareholder votes and are now waiting for TLRY to say “I do” and get married. On April 30th is when TLRY should get the votes to merge with APHA which I believe would increase APHAs price  and in the future the distributions and their clientele. 

With discussions on the rise about legalization (and with the way the US is going) recreational cannabis is not to far away. This business also does stuff with tobacco and alcohol I believe. 

I’m asking because I’ve seen the same trend in a different place. I saw that Monsanto was merging with Bayer back then so I put $1000 into Bayer and I got $11000 out and payed for college next year. 

Thoughts? 

Too long didn’t read: Big ape mesh with big ape to form mega ape is it worth it?"
2021-04-27 00:46:49,wallstreetbets,When the fuck will it happen? Been 3 months listening/reading to this crap.
2021-04-27 01:19:39,wallstreetbets,Im down 20.84% on APHA been waiting for this for what seems like a while. I missed out on MVIS since my money is all tied up with APHA.  Feels bad man.
2021-04-27 00:44:41,wallstreetbets,Green+green=more green?
2021-04-27 02:06:54,wallstreetbets,"Marijuana legalization is supported by 70% of the American population, its inevitable at this point. The European flood gates are about to open as well and Tilary has a massive market share and early mover advantage in Europe."
2021-04-27 08:41:07,wallstreetbets,I think so. I'm in Tilray and earnings are increasing as long as business are opening. Imagin how would it be when they both merge. It would be the most important cannabis company in the world 😎

2021-04-27 00:50:53,wallstreetbets,As far as I seen the timeline of events. The two announced discussions for it back in December of last year. Once 420 hit the news broke out that APHA got the shareholder votes. April 30th this year is when TLRY souls get their votes from the shareholders but it’s tougher. They had a squeeze a little while back but it’s dropped significantly.

2021-04-27 01:38:57,wallstreetbets,It's looks to be appropriately valued if the potential contracts are priced in . Maybe still good for a run to 45 or so and a consolidation into the low 30s until rumor becomes news.. then to the moon
2021-04-27 05:11:42,wallstreetbets,"No, its not undervalued. If anything, is massively overvalued."
2021-04-27 09:17:16,wallstreetbets,Where's the fun in that? If I do research I can probably make small tendies gains. But if I listen to internet strangers and go full ape then I can live at a tendies buffet.

2021-04-27 07:23:12,wallstreetbets,Long time lurker that missed the boat on GME and MVIS. In for 588 shares. It’s not 950k but it’s something.
2021-04-27 09:46:05,wallstreetbets," The two biggest catalysts for a ***huge*** upswing in a short period of time would be a short squeeze on the 35%+ short interest (I personally think the short interest in practicality is much higher until July 5th when restrictions come off PIPE and all other insider shares) or political tailwind with the Medicare age being reduced to 50 from 65 ([https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/proposal-lower-medicare-age-50-130000091.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/proposal-lower-medicare-age-50-130000091.html)).

Fundamentally, though, this stock is a pretty good buy at current pricing on its own merits outside of the potential major upswings. That's why I like this stock versus a GME or MVIS that have the potential (or high likelihood depending on how you view it) to absolutely crash to the ground.

$CLOV is a very high floor, very high ceiling stock, in my opinion. I like it for that and I like it long term."

The insurance model is a PPO currently serving AZ, GA, MI, NJ, PA, SC, TN, and TX for Medicare Advantage who are age 65 or older due to Medicare requirements. I just wonder how Clover Health is going to decrease medication costs for patients since PPO is filled at a CVS, Rite Aid, or Walgreens, and drug prices are negotiated by either Cardinal, Mckesson's, or whoever is their supplier.

2021-04-27 00:45:45,wallstreetbets,Atta baby.  $CLOV is definitely your lowest downside risk.
2021-04-27 14:42:07,wallstreetbets,Well put. My exact thinking - win win.
2021-04-27 15:47:56,wallstreetbets,"in 8 years this stock will be 100$ or more if you compare it to UNH and TDOC.  that would make OP's position worth 10,000,000.  

9 million dollars in 8 years sounds hella good if you ask me.  thats more than a million dollars a year for OP lol."
2021-04-27 09:16:43,wallstreetbets,"The two biggest catalysts for a ***huge*** upswing in a short period of time would be a short squeeze on the 35%+ short interest (I personally think the short interest in practicality is much higher until July 5th when restrictions come off PIPE and all other insider shares) or political tailwind with the Medicare age being reduced to 50 from 65 ([https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/proposal-lower-medicare-age-50-130000091.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/proposal-lower-medicare-age-50-130000091.html)).

Fundamentally, though, this stock is a pretty good buy at current pricing on its own merits outside of the potential major upswings.  That's why I like this stock versus a GME or MVIS that have the potential (or high likelihood depending on how you view it) to absolutely crash to the ground.

$CLOV is a very high floor, very high ceiling stock, in my opinion.  I like it for that and I like it long term."
2021-04-27 00:35:57,wallstreetbets,Short squeeze would be a nice bonus but this is a ugh floor really high ceiling play.  Those don’t come along often.

2021-04-27 03:08:40,wallstreetbets,MNMD is a magic carpet ride
2021-04-27 07:43:24,wallstreetbets,"
A sincere advice here, I know that many of you plan to sell their shares today if the price peaks. You are definitely free to do what you think appropriate but here are a couple of words you may want to hear.

If you plan to sell because you think that today is the peak price that will be followed by drop, It might be true if the uplisting is the only catalyst we have... in fact we have alot more

First we are slowly getting media attention and soon enough I expect that Mindmed will be the front line of many websites like Bloomberg and others based on the out performance that will happen on uplisting. We might get a tweet from Elon Mask also that send us truly to moon!

We have milestones from the drug development and will each announcement of successful stage completed it will push the stock higher, Imagine the price when Mindmed file for their first drug FDA approval

We dont have any institutions in yet, once those jump in,it will give great credibility and confidence in the stock. You may kick yourself if you see the stock price that time and remember when you sold it earlier at 10$ and thought it is the best deal they can get.

This is not financial advice but rather an opinion based on some facts and assumptions"

2021-04-27 08:54:52,wallstreetbets,The bid -ask spread is nuts. Could see some heavy downward pressure in the first hour. If your not already in it buy the drop after first buy orders are filled.  Usually after 25 minutes

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What you really need to know about how short squeezes work and a screener to help (Must Read) So I think everyone on this sub now just goes this stock is about to short squeeze cause the short interest is high and people that are shorting will get margin called and just spewing shit most of the time cause they don’t know the other two most important factors that go into it.

I came across a website finally that gave me the data that I have been looking for with out signing up for some shit and paying a fee. Iborrowdesk is seriously dope and gives the two other indicators to spot a short squeeze in the future.   


The two other idicators for a short squeeze is of course a high short interest which this site doesn’t give you but can find this info almost on anything now. But the two other factors this gives you is the amount of available shares to short and the most important factor is the borrow rate. You put these three things together you got a ticking time bomb.   


To make a short squeeze work you need a decent high short interest of 20% +, a borrow rate of 20% +, and a low number of available shares to short left. This is why we see some meme stocks fly and other go up 2$.   


Good Meme: GME, MVIS, Tilray, Rocket

Bad Meme: CLOV and ASO

&#x200B;

If you go to Iborrowdesk you can search tickers and see if the borrow rate is increasing over time and if shares available are staying the same or going down and using another website just look up high short interest stocks and put them in.

&#x200B;

So just an easy example for an explanation.   
Ticket: ABC has a short interest of 35%

Borrow Rate has gone up from 2%-30% over the last 3 months

The available short is low which means not a lot of shares left to borrow 

ABC has been trading sideways or increasing in price for 3-4 months.

$10 to $12. This means the shorts are losing 20% just on the stock price itself and if they hold for a year they will lose another 30% because of the borrow rate so they would need this stock to go below $7 to make money back which is ridiculous to hold for that amount of time and if borrow rate keeps increasing they will need to get out sooner than later.   


So tickers I found.

MVIS is def following this pattern to a tee.

One that is going to explode if this sub starts to trend it is Triterras.   
Short interest above 30%

Borrow rate steadily increasing and is around 45-50%

Available shares about 30,000

Stock trading sideways and slightly increasing for 4 months.

‘Shorts would need this to drop to around 5$ in the next few months to make money back and if borrow rate keep increasing it will be impossible to make money and will have to sell.

let me know if any other tickers we could find some gems in this if people start doing this."
2021-04-27 00:26:38,wallstreetbets,"Triggering event is as important as other three. In case GME it’s Ryan Cohen, MVIS is anticipation of either buyout or new tech widely successful which I think is high possibility given mass race towards autonomous., not only cars but delivery and shipping."
2021-04-27 19:41:43,wallstreetbets,Great call on MVIS. Way to get people to buy at the top.
2021-04-27 00:06:30,wallstreetbets,Zero shares left to short with MVIS!
2021-04-27 04:27:11,wallstreetbets,"What's the lowdown on Triterras? I read something about financial irregularities.

Also Metromile (MILE) looks like it has some potential. Not done much DD though."
2021-04-27 00:11:31,wallstreetbets,Iborrowdesk doesn't know where all the shares are. Often it will be at 0 while several brokers have plenty to short. I also dont see how that matters in triggering a short squeeze?
2021-04-27 00:38:58,wallstreetbets,So MVIS is probably going to skyrocket correct??
2021-04-27 01:33:46,wallstreetbets,Triterras is heavily undervalued at the moment. Trading at $8 now but should be $15 at least according to the 100% growth rate.

2021-04-27 05:09:54,wallstreetbets,RemindMe!
2021-04-27 00:39:36,wallstreetbets,"Yes also correct. But the squeeze does not happen usually at the exact time of the news. When Cohen came onto the board of GME on Sunday, Monday GME went up a little like to 18-19$ and on that Tuesday is when it really started. Same with RKT earnings and div payout it took two to three days for it to actually go. Then you got Koss, Bed Bath, Dillards, etc that nothing fundamentally changed or anything and they all mooned cause these factors hit crazy marks."
2021-04-27 00:45:22,wallstreetbets,Obligatory mention that there are zero shares left on iborrowdesk which only tracks one single broker. There are still tons of other brokers with shortable shares
2021-04-27 00:12:11,wallstreetbets,"MVIS is maybe gonna get ridiculous. Numbers are matching up quite nicely for it 85,000 shares came back into the market from Friday which is expected but still quite a lot left. Borrow rate has almost tripled in a week too. The best thing about this to is that it updates every 15 minutes so you can start to time the peak to an extent when number of available shorts increase dramatically."
2021-04-27 00:10:12,wallstreetbets,Can’t wait to buy more shares tomorrow :)
2021-04-27 00:46:07,wallstreetbets,"Iborrowdesk tracks ONE BROKER. So even if it’s 0 on there, it doesn’t mean there’s no shares left everywhere"
2021-04-27 00:21:00,wallstreetbets,Available short shares allow you to see if how many shorts exit their position and are still available to short. If people don’t pick them up and they just keep adding to the available then the short will end sooner. If price keeps rising and people will exit others will get in then they exit and others get in then exit it just keeps compounding on the squeeze
2021-04-27 00:41:00,wallstreetbets,Based on the data its got another day at least for a rip
2021-04-27 00:15:39,wallstreetbets,AMC is a hard one to track cause it’s not that obvious as other and that could be part due to how many outstanding shares there are. I haven’t done much research into AMC but def a good meme stock and looking at Iborrowdesk the rate is increasing a lot and not a lot of available shares I don’t know what their short interest is though.

2021-04-27 01:10:34,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, it takes times for things to sink in. MVIS tech showcased by halo lens breakdown which was long time before now. I invested in it at .35$ but sold it when it hit 2$. Did not know how SS worked then and not now too :)"
2021-04-27 00:41:15,wallstreetbets,MVIS is currently at $26.44 is this a good buy price? Or am i too late?
2021-04-27 00:23:15,wallstreetbets,Yes brokers can technically allow to borrow more shares to others but if no one picks them up and then its not part of this equation
2021-04-27 00:23:44,wallstreetbets,"How does that compound though? If someone shorts and then closes their position that doesn't ""compound"" it has a ner zero effect on price"
2021-04-27 05:31:18,wallstreetbets,I formally appoint you President of Acquisitions. Your role is to scout the Squeeze of the Month here at SQUEEZE Squad. This is your mission should you choose to accept it.
2021-04-27 03:29:05,wallstreetbets,Should I invest in GME or MVIS short term wise?
2021-04-27 02:57:01,wallstreetbets,One day?? Newbie here. Please explain 🙏 thinking of dropping 2.5k
2021-04-27 05:13:51,wallstreetbets,can you help me understand how you came to this conclusion?
2021-04-27 02:33:05,wallstreetbets,Days to cover went up to 2 today I believe
2021-04-27 02:34:40,wallstreetbets,"AMC is definitely the next runner up as it’s the most shorted stock on the market.. and also GME’s sibling stock. 0 shares available to short, been that way for the past week. Definitely worth looking in to, don’t miss out on the moon trip!"
2021-04-27 14:12:05,wallstreetbets,"There's no expiry like there is with options, so there is no deadline."
2021-04-27 09:17:40,wallstreetbets,shortsight
2021-04-27 08:47:31,wallstreetbets,It’s also not all good news triggers squeezes on shorted stocks. And vice versa that some stocks moon for no reason like DiScover b
2021-04-27 02:15:58,wallstreetbets,"Actually $28.87 after the after market.

Some say $50 target.

Me, I sold most of my calls and shares Friday at $18.50 for a big gain. Sad panda today I didn't ride the weekend.

Very very sad panda."
2021-04-27 00:44:49,wallstreetbets,Based on the data it’s got one more rip or even more
2021-04-27 00:32:59,wallstreetbets,Original shorts get in on a stock price fall usually. This adds selling pressure at that time and usually will see the stock go down with momentum trading with people selling and shorting. When a squeeze starts to trigger old shorts exit and new shorts come in and try to time the market. Any other time you are correct to the net zero On this. But with this usually buy orders start to consume sell orders and the shorts that got in trying to time buy back in and causes more of a frenzy with buy orders and people fomoing. MVIS is a good example especially today. From 8:30 to 1:10 traded sideways and the new shorts get out and that’s when the buy orders fly in.
2021-04-27 07:10:48,wallstreetbets,"Always GME when you can.  MVIS = discount GME.  

Not financial advice."
2021-04-27 05:13:10,wallstreetbets,obviously mvis
2021-04-27 08:29:03,wallstreetbets,AMC IS INSANE RIGHT NOW! worth looking into at the very least spend 30 mins of your time checking it out
2021-04-27 19:39:03,wallstreetbets,"Apes take profits, 🐗 don't"
2021-04-27 02:15:15,wallstreetbets,Can you explain what you mean by the data? How do you know from iborrowdesk that there is one more rip?
2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,God Bless Microvision and Sumit Sharma 
2021-04-27 01:25:44,wallstreetbets,I should buy mvis tomorrow? Idk
2021-04-27 00:17:50,wallstreetbets,"I did so much good today,  thanks yall"
2021-04-27 03:49:35,wallstreetbets,BIG MICROVISION ENERGY
2021-04-27 00:04:50,wallstreetbets,When you dumping?
2021-04-27 07:11:50,wallstreetbets,Amen!
2021-04-27 00:16:00,wallstreetbets,Dump and buy gme
2021-04-27 00:26:39,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-27 00:07:56,wallstreetbets,Hopefully they hold till Thursday !
2021-04-27 00:13:36,wallstreetbets,I’ve been in for 4 months and am fully confident Sumit will come through on his promises. But my feelings right now is I will mostly like see what happens this week and then dump all 7500 shares. Put 10-20k of profits into OTM calls for the potential catalyst on April 29th.
2021-04-27 00:17:20,wallstreetbets,I made 200k on the real GME squeeze that happened months ago. I invest in real stocks with real futures now
2021-04-27 01:59:22,wallstreetbets,Why in the ever loving of fuck are you flapping your gums about?
2021-04-27 00:54:34,wallstreetbets,AFAIK they've met earnings expectations for the last year...so this week should be no different.  You really think its gonna take a dive?
2021-04-27 02:33:51,wallstreetbets,Bruh hold AND buy otm calls.
2021-04-27 00:25:19,wallstreetbets,You belong here
2021-04-27 00:25:52,wallstreetbets,Gme fud bot
2021-04-27 01:44:17,wallstreetbets,haaaaa.
2021-04-27 13:41:54,wallstreetbets,I also meant the ever so slight chance that A-Sample is delayed and or specs aren’t as they were touted the previous months. Sharma will take us to the chicken tender buffet and I have full confidence is his ability to execute.
2021-04-27 03:15:41,wallstreetbets,"They’ve had absolute garbage revenues and and balance sheets over the previous quarters but that’s because they’ve spent the past 10 years efforts focused entirely on hololens, IVAS, and their upcoming lidar unit, among other things. They haven’t have a product or service to offer in the past 10 years, their capital has solely been tied up in funding research/testing and product development. That’s the critical point where these new smooth brained young investors just don’t understand. MVIS and Sumit Sharma has spent the past year scaling Everest, and they’re about to reach the summit."
2021-04-27 03:04:25,wallstreetbets,I’ve watched this stock get brutally beaten before my eyes and I’ve ever left over $150k on table over the past two months if I would’ve swinged. I can’t just keep looking at all this money bounce around
2021-04-27 02:42:21,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-27 00:29:11,wallstreetbets,Well I’ll probably be dead by the time GME ever squeezes to $500 again
2021-04-27 03:05:52,wallstreetbets,"No manufacturable product until 2023. Until they scale down the size of their units, they have a long way to go."
2021-04-27 06:53:00,wallstreetbets,No bro you picked the wrong one stop asking in every thread

2021-04-27 12:34:44,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-27 12:36:23,wallstreetbets,"It's already been noted but most of those earning big on MVIS were in on it before it was on the radar of WSB. It was more in the ""0.01 stock"" realm until very recently. I don't think it was even possible to discuss it here due to the rules. It's possible it keeps rising but if you want the big returns (x20+), those days are likely gone. To get x20 return now would require it to hit $400 / share. A lot of these <$1 stocks go nowhere or even drop lower so it's risky but the appeal is the low cost to buy in and the possibility of a high return when everything goes right."
2021-04-27 12:47:06,wallstreetbets,Congrats. Holding or taking some profits?
2021-04-27 12:57:34,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you
2021-04-27 13:03:34,wallstreetbets,"Hi , new to wallstreet.
When i saw MVIS post today about how it will shoot up, i looked online and saw that the company wasn't doing too well and didn't consider purchasing their shares.

After seeing the OP here i just checked the stock price and it has fallen down. 

What is going on here ?"
2021-04-27 13:18:10,wallstreetbets,Adddddd it’s gone.
2021-04-27 13:24:05,wallstreetbets,And it’s gone.
2021-04-27 13:27:15,wallstreetbets,"Wow. I made $800 on $500 purchase and was happy.

Note: I panicked sold yesterday morning. I didn't really know the hype around MVIS. I rebought the same amount of shares and will HODL now."
2021-04-27 13:33:53,wallstreetbets,How did this turn to a cooking channel ? Lol
2021-04-27 13:34:02,wallstreetbets,. . . and then you weren't.  But hold it. I'm sure it will go back up.
2021-04-27 14:39:44,wallstreetbets,"I didn't make millions, but I did make a few thousand, I sold my MVIS yesterday at 26"
2021-04-27 14:43:44,wallstreetbets,Glad I could help! Hand me those bags!
2021-04-27 16:19:49,wallstreetbets,How did this age?
2021-04-27 16:37:18,wallstreetbets,Not a millionaire until you realize those gains bro
2021-04-27 17:18:23,wallstreetbets,"You mean you are a millionaire until you try and touch it and the government begins the process of bending you over a table and asked if you want a bucket of rusty nails, or shards of glass for lube."
2021-04-27 18:14:46,wallstreetbets,Not anymore. The hype didn't last... Stock is now down.
2021-04-27 18:33:20,wallstreetbets,Congrats on your gamble
2021-04-27 19:13:24,wallstreetbets,How about now? 🤔

2021-04-27 12:10:43,wallstreetbets,I have come to learn that this sub is just basically rich people bragging about how rich they are.
2021-04-27 12:28:31,wallstreetbets,"These types of posts are just karma whores. I mean you were obviously already rich to begin with, and maybe even already a millionaire..."

Probably not a short squeeze target, but a strong balance sheet company, unloved for 20 years in its sector, where just a smidge of retail interest can double, triple, or increase share price from the doldrums to be in line with its sector peers.

Just
My humble opinion...and I am not providing financial advice.  I just love the stock."

2021-04-27 00:42:24,wallstreetbets,"I played with MVIS options in my robinhood account in the fall and did pretty good, but I am not as knowledgeable as I would like to be with options so made some money and sold. If I had held on to them though, damn! I would be deep in the money and they were calls for 2022 I think. They were still cheap then though. Too pricey recently."
2021-04-27 00:47:34,wallstreetbets,The mega rich won't let that happen.  They own politicians.

2021-04-27 01:33:43,wallstreetbets,"Not %100 sure, been in it for 7 years, but I'm guessing about $80k total of my own and company 401k money. I bought a lot of shares in the $1 range. Over the years. Plus bought and sold, and bought back in some too."
2021-04-27 01:38:30,wallstreetbets,Fidelity
2021-04-27 01:52:18,wallstreetbets,"This is just from an app called ""my portfolio"".  I use fidelity. I started using the app last year so it doesn't show the whole 7 years of buys and sells of MVIS which is why it appears my initial Investment is like $300k. It is actually more like $80k stretched out over 4 or 5 years."
2021-04-27 02:02:00,wallstreetbets,"Makes LIDAR modules and also the major component that makes the Hololens 2 and IVAS possible.  Do yourself a favor and google ""Hololens 2"" and ""IVAS"""
2021-04-27 02:14:03,wallstreetbets,"My stocks portfolio, it's just a tracker where you can enter your buys and sells, watch prices. I have multiple brokerages so it's an easy way to track it all. You can't actually trade with it. I primarily use fidelity though."

2021-04-27 02:25:35,wallstreetbets,these stories are all the same boring
2021-04-27 02:42:39,wallstreetbets,7 years ago the thought going around was Pico projectors built into cell phones. Sounded like a billion dollar idea to me! Hasn't taken off yet though. They have got into other areas though too fortunately. Specifically LIDAR and augmented reality (Hololens 2 and IVAS)
2021-04-27 02:34:27,wallstreetbets,"It's just an app I track my portfolio with because I have a few brokerages. Keeps it all in one place for easy viewing. Called ""my stocks portfolio"""
2021-04-27 02:48:20,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, before the last few days I was thinking if there is a full buyout- $60ish. If a strategic Investment around $35. I am not any kind of stock pricing expert though. If this goes the way of GME though maybe can get into the triple digits."

2021-04-27 06:35:54,wallstreetbets,"there is one thing i always remind people. I doesn't matter how you got there, be it luck, be it genius, be it connections, you got it. Great work and perseverance.

Not a lot of people would trade the same equity for 7 years. Not a lot of people would hold through the losses you were experiencing (esp. in 2020 where you could throw a dart at a wall of tickers and make 50%), not a lot of people would have gotten back to break even and held or would have been looking at 100% profit and still holding.

So kudos to you for following your instinct and it paying off.

All this said, if you plan on holding, god's speed, but if you are looking at an exit, selling some deep ITM options can still earn you around 10%. for example, at yesterday's close of $26.4, selling the $19 would have given you an exit price of $29, which would have been a 10% upside and 30% pullback protection."
2021-04-27 11:47:53,wallstreetbets,"Yep!

I took profit at 24 on the slide at open today, and I'll buy back in after things settle a little post-ER. I still like the stock."

2021-04-27 01:14:17,wallstreetbets,"if u don’t mind me asking, how exactly does selling and buying back in work? if i’m making a profit on my stock, do i sell it at a high price, then buy when there’s a tiny dip if lets say there’s an upward trend? or should i leave the profits and buy more stocks n add on"

2021-04-27 00:34:24,wallstreetbets,You gotta big 401k bud. How many other plays have you made with such conviction? Did they pan out? Congrats on the success!
2021-04-27 00:43:23,wallstreetbets,"You still pay tax on 401k's, it's the Roth IRA that doesn't get taxed"
2021-04-27 13:31:30,wallstreetbets,I think you'll need to post some follow up at some point.
2021-04-27 15:19:25,wallstreetbets,Why do you keep spamming this?
2021-04-27 10:31:45,wallstreetbets,I hope when earnings come out it rockets up and this guy just missed out on millions more haha guy has a 250k worth of shares and holding a shit stock for 7 years seems very skekchy and smells a lot like bull shit

2021-04-27 12:51:24,wallstreetbets,That’s incredible well done!! I was up £7000 (invested £5000) that was crazy money for me and I held. I hope I’m not a bag holder and it goes off again. I was waiting on $30 😥😥😥 oh well live and learn.
2021-04-27 12:44:10,wallstreetbets,Lol I Sold didn’t make a million but I did well enough
2021-04-27 12:34:04,wallstreetbets,yay good job! How do you about doing research?
2021-04-27 12:54:54,wallstreetbets,"I jumped in at $22 for 50, and $20 for $50"
2021-04-27 13:30:08,wallstreetbets,Amazing. I held and now it's down so I'm a little sad
2021-04-27 14:32:47,wallstreetbets,I will watch your career with great interest once the GME saga is done ❤
2021-04-27 15:53:02,wallstreetbets,"😆 I'm far from being a boomer dumb ass and I made 1500% on my money last year.  

The challenge is to trade $1,000 for 1 year and make $1 million dollars. 

Can you do it? 
All you have to do is gain 1% per day"
2021-04-27 12:08:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but probably not a millionaire at the moment."
2021-04-27 12:09:18,wallstreetbets,How did you decide to sell then?
2021-04-27 02:10:22,wallstreetbets,haha good one but yeah I find that their product is the better one
2021-04-27 03:43:40,wallstreetbets,A squirt of lemon and some salsa Valentina are a must.
2021-04-27 02:33:50,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm, green onions are legit in ramen. 

Also recommend sliced radish, and a few drops of chili oil."
2021-04-27 01:24:43,wallstreetbets,"100%, and a little squirt of lemon 🍋😍"
2021-04-27 02:41:53,wallstreetbets,Chives and soy sauce

2021-04-27 07:13:54,wallstreetbets,Chopped spring onions!
2021-04-27 01:54:21,wallstreetbets,Mix that with some Japanese mayonnaise
2021-04-27 04:10:32,wallstreetbets,"Always onion in my egg ramen, FYI."
2021-04-27 04:39:37,wallstreetbets,Boiled egg?
2021-04-27 04:53:41,wallstreetbets,add a slice of kraft and spring onion.  legit korean style
2021-04-27 05:01:54,wallstreetbets,Have you tried adding noodles or a broth of some sort?  It really ups the ramen game from just the hard boiled egg and onions.
2021-04-27 05:32:01,wallstreetbets,Cheese.. Gouda especially
2021-04-27 05:44:14,wallstreetbets,Could you share some of them please?
2021-04-27 06:00:10,wallstreetbets,This is a great idea for lunch tomorrow
2021-04-27 06:03:50,wallstreetbets,I made a post about gourmet ramen!! You guys should add to it. It's the Poor Apes special.
2021-04-27 06:13:25,wallstreetbets,"Ramen can be amazing even if you're not poor.

Valencia Sausage, some spam, green onions, chives, egg and a dash of chicken bullion.

Maybe some sesame oil if you're feeling adventurous"
2021-04-27 06:20:35,wallstreetbets,I throw in a slice of spam if I'm really lucky that week and got extra tips. But otherwise it's just 2 eggs for protein.
2021-04-27 06:26:10,wallstreetbets,"Not really a recipe, that’s literally how you make ramen. People eat plane bs, and wonder why they got no sauce"
2021-04-27 06:58:16,wallstreetbets,Chive on?
2021-04-27 07:13:41,wallstreetbets,"Hell yeah, I get the spicy ramen, cook up some bacon and throw some in with some egg"
2021-04-27 07:36:03,wallstreetbets,"6 minute soft boiled egg, chives, and a little butter with Shin ramen is amazing."
2021-04-27 07:36:22,wallstreetbets,Mind sharing those recipes?
2021-04-27 08:04:58,wallstreetbets,"I also like to add some Sriracha, sesame oil, and a splash of rice vinegar"
2021-04-27 09:40:50,wallstreetbets,Also a crushed up bag of Doritos..some hot sauce..and some dried beans.
2021-04-27 09:41:18,wallstreetbets,"Drain the water, chicken flavor, butter, parmesan, black pepper, and it slaps."
2021-04-27 10:01:33,wallstreetbets,Ramen is delicious 😋
2021-04-27 10:30:38,wallstreetbets,Care to share?  Am poor man
2021-04-27 10:47:08,wallstreetbets,Throw some bacon in that fucker and give it a few hits of the sriracha and a bit of seasame oil.
2021-04-27 11:23:01,wallstreetbets,Frozen mixed veggies and Sriracha.

2021-04-27 13:01:30,wallstreetbets,Add some Sambal Oelek and some gochujang and use better than Boulon instead of the packet... game changer
2021-04-27 14:30:13,wallstreetbets,"Mayo, szechuan sauce, cilantro.

Note: This is a *high class* ramen take, so make sure to drain most of the water out before tossing in the flavor pack and the extra goodies."
2021-04-27 14:59:07,wallstreetbets,Bi-weekly... pfft rookie numbers.
2021-04-27 15:43:53,wallstreetbets,"Am millionaire, go out to eat and gorge myself on $20 hipster ramen with organic locally raised pork belly and all the fixings nightly."
2021-04-27 15:47:13,wallstreetbets,I’m 43 yrs old and I still eat Ramen. Put tuna fish in it sometimes with a little mustard(& I hate mustard but it compliment) or some Tabasco
2021-04-27 16:07:56,wallstreetbets,"A scallion too, and a generous splash of your favourite Habanero hot sauce if you're into spicy. Can't go wrong with the traditional chili oil, but I personally really like Marie Sharp's Belizean Heat or The General's Shock & Awe.

Careful with herbs & spices tho - very easy to ruin it by adding something that doesn't go well with the included packet."
2021-04-27 16:32:28,wallstreetbets,i personally put my feces in my ramen
2021-04-27 16:46:05,wallstreetbets,Add 2 instant curry blocks and thank me later.
2021-04-27 17:11:41,wallstreetbets,I came for the gains but left with a recipe. I love life!
2021-04-27 17:23:30,wallstreetbets,Also put Kimchi in there... yeee
2021-04-27 17:31:10,wallstreetbets,I prefer just adding a slice of velveeta sammich cheese.
2021-04-27 06:53:54,wallstreetbets,That’s some boujee ass ramen 😬
2021-04-27 04:22:20,wallstreetbets,Cheese in ramen...the horror
2021-04-27 03:59:58,wallstreetbets,Recently learned about this. Absolute Game changer.
2021-04-27 17:54:43,wallstreetbets,"For real, like, I’m happy for em’, but having a quarter mil to throw at stocks tells me you’re already pretty fucking well off. Like, more well off than almost everyone I know...I liked it better when that kid a few weeks ago posted that he turned $6500 into like 900k in less than a year. That’s some shit I can really get behind lol"
2021-04-27 14:05:52,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.  Most of us are salary people.  You have to have quite a bit of money to really make moves in the stock market, or be incredibly, stupidly lucky."

2021-04-27 05:18:46,wallstreetbets,I will hangout at my wendys when the time comes!!
2021-04-27 06:05:21,wallstreetbets,"It's not some secret method. It's just a combination of cooking time, amount of water, and how much I stir the egg. I use just enough water to submerge the noodles fully to achieve maximum saltiness, undercook the noodles significantly so they stay al dente for longer, and I add the eggs at the end with the heat turned down so the bubbles from boiling don't agitate them too much and stir only a few times so the egg whites cling to the noodles and the egg yolk is mixed into the soup.

I'm not saying it's the best way to cook/eat packaged ramen, it's just my personal preference. Every time someone else prepares it for me, it tastes and feels a little off. I'd say is akin to how you arrange your blankets and pillows when you sleep."
2021-04-27 08:27:21,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-27 12:45:37,wallstreetbets,Mods?

2021-04-27 07:04:50,wallstreetbets,Don't waste your money; lambos suck
2021-04-27 01:40:10,wallstreetbets,I would not call it sensible. MVIS was a trainwreck for most of the 7 years I've been invested. I chalk it up to stubbornness and luck. I am for sure no investing genius!
2021-04-27 02:05:22,wallstreetbets,sir this is a casino. If you want etf boomer advice go to r/investing

2021-04-27 11:02:23,wallstreetbets,What sub do you think you're on?
2021-04-27 11:41:00,wallstreetbets," Very little taxes paid since most of it is in a 401k, a bit in a roth too."
2021-04-27 12:11:05,wallstreetbets,Not much taxes paid because most is in a 401k
2021-04-27 01:27:35,wallstreetbets,401k is a retirement account
2021-04-27 01:49:57,wallstreetbets,"This is probably his traditional IRA account, which means you pay taxes later when you take money from the account, rather than having it owed each year as regular income."
2021-04-27 09:00:56,wallstreetbets,Good lord why did you catch all the downvotes. Just a question people.
2021-04-27 06:25:43,wallstreetbets,No I don't think I will. Someone else might tho
2021-04-27 00:35:13,wallstreetbets,I think the rich should be taxed a LOT more until I'm rich.
2021-04-27 01:17:15,wallstreetbets,How do you self direct your 401k? Al fidelity gives me is category options
2021-04-27 02:15:15,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, under new proposal, you will have to make more than 1 million in capital gains per year(I.e sell and make more than 1 mil profit). So you can book gains of 999k and then 1 k next year's and have no effect of joes plant-based capital gain taxes."
2021-04-27 11:08:47,wallstreetbets,Sold 20k at $25. I will buy back in eventually at a lower price with more shares. Hoping to add another 5000 shares. That's how you build wealth!
2021-04-27 11:50:21,wallstreetbets,"This ape knows, buy low sell high and increase your position."
2021-04-27 11:47:26,wallstreetbets,"How do you think I got to where I am? Buy low, sell high my ape friend!"
2021-04-27 11:48:45,wallstreetbets,Maybe I'm one of those idiot savant apes 🦧
2021-04-27 01:19:12,wallstreetbets,"Yes hold till the stock hits your price target, then when the stock price dips to your lower target you buy back in and can get more stock than you had before. Of course there are times you buy back in and it keeps going lower, then you have to wait or buy more and average down. Took me 7 years to get my position. Some good months, many bad though too. Just waited it out. Luck was on my side."
2021-04-27 01:19:18,wallstreetbets,Follow catalyst events like earnings or demos. But also if you're tunnel-visioning one stock for 7 years you probably get a real good idea of when its going to dive and rally.
2021-04-27 01:16:47,wallstreetbets,"This was my question as well, thanknyou for asking ;)"
2021-04-27 02:00:36,wallstreetbets,“So I buy low and sell high?”
2021-04-27 10:48:46,wallstreetbets,"dude no one here cares if you're poor or rich. this isnt the sub to whine about evil capitalists.

turning 80k to 1mil is still more than 10x gains. if you posted a thread where you turned your 2k to 25k people would still upvote it because you scored a nice win on what was likely a gamble.

people who feel a need to add buts to peoples achievements are always losers. someone succeeds and instead of just being happy for them they feel a need to explain why it doesnt _really_ count, its all a way to protect their own fragile egos from facing their shortcomings. they need constant fucking excuses, this time its ""im not a millionaire so i couldnt do this myself so it doesnt count"".

like seriously why the fuck do you need to say ""but from the looks of it you werent financially hurting"" on a post like this? this isnt a subreddit for poor people to post them turning their financial lifes around. this is a sub that glorifies big gambles on the market regardless of if you won big or lost big."
2021-04-27 01:54:39,wallstreetbets,He knows

2021-04-27 04:33:19,wallstreetbets,Is a million bucks in an IRA enough to escape the rat race?
2021-04-27 00:34:36,wallstreetbets,That’s what I was thinking
2021-04-27 14:54:08,wallstreetbets,Because it will still rise. This is much more than a WSB play. Do a little research about the company. More money to be made!
2021-04-27 13:43:24,wallstreetbets,Gambling is how you make money here! Nothing is certain on Wall Street.
2021-04-27 12:39:49,wallstreetbets,"What price target do you have for buying back in?  I bought 50 at $22, and another 50 at $20"
2021-04-27 00:46:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but not till I withdraw it and then at normal income tax rate. And I am 46 so have a ways to go till 65 if I don't want the penalty."
2021-04-27 13:33:50,wallstreetbets,"I don't know. Didn't think my post would get so much attention. Probably just fade back into obscurity, lol"
2021-04-27 10:40:18,wallstreetbets,"see, now youre just being a hater. lame. not because youre calling bulllshit, but because your hoping someone else suffers because you lost out. crab in a bucket mentality will get you nowhere."

1500% even more so. 

Didn't mean to call you a boomer. The comment was directed at the boomer mentality that broad based ETFs earning 14% are always the most prudent investments."

2021-04-27 10:35:48,wallstreetbets,Depending on how your employer has their 401k setup and depending on the capabilities of their record keeper they might offer the ability to use your 401k contributions in an associated brokerage account. It’s not very common as most employers tend to go for less volatile investment line ups in their retirement accounts so that their employees don’t do stupid shit and gamble away their entire retirement savings in brokerage account. Wouldn’t recommend even if you have the ability.
2021-04-27 15:55:11,wallstreetbets,IRA isn’t 401k..

I have a Rollerover IRA with Fidelity and I called them and asked if I can self manage a portion of the portfolio and they transferred $15k into a separate Rollerover IRA for me to manage on my own. This way the two accounts are different and they can still do the semi-auto managed account without me muddling about with it.  The whole process took about 10 minutes, and then a few business days for the money to transfer into the new account.  I am assuming you can do the same with the 401k."

Of course, doing this locks you in to selling/buying at some price weeks/months in advance."

2021-04-27 10:20:40,wallstreetbets,"Depends on how you look at it.  

A large part of why they call it a rat race is uncertainty, fear, and stress.  

A lot of people that picture getting out of the rat race picture retiring to a beach and sipping fruity alcoholic conxotions.

There is a difference between having a career and being part of the rat race. 

There is a HUGE value and peace of mind that comes from having a well stocked IRA when you are young.

You can switch jobs when you are unhappy and really find what you want to do. You can work for less so you have less stress. You can find jobs with a higher quality of life that works for you.  

Escaping the rat race doesn't have to be a complete escape, just an escape from uncertainty, doubt, and fear."

There are also additional taxes if you cash out before a certain age I believe."
2021-04-27 10:33:28,wallstreetbets,It’s taxed the same as it normally would be (only different depending on tax bracket) - but you just incur an early withdrawal penalty of 10% if you do that before age 59.5.

2021-04-27 03:13:42,wallstreetbets,"There's a reason why it's the 1% and not the .1% because billionaires that actually control the country wanted to be lumped in with the hundreds of thousands of people making 500k+. So when class warfare happens, it's hundreds of thousands of 'them' and not dozens. 

The low end 1%ers have a nice house in the suburbs, a couple of nice cars, maybe one vacation home. Billionaires have multiple mansions, super yachts, private islands, fleet of cars, staff that take care of them and their assets, etc.

It's absolutely insane a doctor, dentist, small business owner, engineer, etc the low end 1%ers are in the same tax bracket as Elon Musk, Bezos, etc."

Millionare only get's taxed 28% \*on the top\* $750,000 or so dollars of \*\*that year's income\*\*, and 0% tax on the first $12,000, etc.. So like, if you're literally pulling a million dollars \*\*a year\*\* in income maybe just enjoy your $800,000 a year and wait until March of next year to become a millionare again.

Excuse my shitty math. I think Joe's plan doesn't even tax the high amount until after you gain a full million, but you get the idea."
2021-04-27 02:22:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, too much in-fight between upper middle class to lower middle / lower class. At the end of the day, the difference between them is rather small compared to the filthy rich. Most upper middle class with net worths of 500k-2MM are still a working man and need the salary to maintain their quality of life, especially at higher cost of living areas with expensive home a big if not majority of their net worth (or rent, costing a shit ton every month). Sure a decent portion of it is ""luxury"", but not the bulk of it. 

I know plenty people talks about 1MM-2MM is more than enough to be ""financially independent"", but it isn't if you have a ""reasonable"" amount of hobbies, life desires, have kids, and if you want to pass down any amount of generational wealth (usually in the form of a real estate). You have to make plenty of sacrifices to make 1MM ""financial freedom"" work, and that alone speaks to how not-amazing 1MM is today. At costlier cities with slightly more than basic lives, truly even 2-3MM net worth isn't all that much. 

Comparing this to people with 10MM+, much less to actual billionaires is a joke."

2021-04-27 01:08:36,wallstreetbets,what about the company caught your eye back then?
2021-04-27 00:31:28,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a rough journey, but like you said it paid off. How’d you get the initial $80k to put in? Savings, took out collateral against your home?"
2021-04-27 00:36:29,wallstreetbets,Glad it worked out for you 🦧🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-27 03:08:38,wallstreetbets,wtf no red????? you  don't belong here.
2021-04-27 01:15:03,wallstreetbets,"Is this all just from buying shares, and not options?"
2021-04-27 03:49:21,wallstreetbets,How much in taxes did you pay? Seems to be an expensive route to a million. Not that I wouldn’t take any route lol.
2021-04-27 07:44:30,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you earned it. 

I'm looking at a similar situation. I'm just not sure the claims being made are true. I've asked for technicals but still no real science behind it. 

I want it to be true and that's where it gets dangerous."
2021-04-27 07:45:24,wallstreetbets,"THIS is the comment that should be elevated!

And

THIS is the way, congrats!!🚀🎉🦍🚀"
2021-04-27 01:34:38,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-27 10:42:49,wallstreetbets,Were you buying and selling or just adding to anytime it dipped?
2021-04-27 19:32:56,wallstreetbets,MAN!
2021-04-27 07:36:58,wallstreetbets,"My buddy did the same, kicks himself pretty good"
2021-04-27 07:42:52,wallstreetbets,When gme was bopping and bb and nok took off before vlad got scheisty it felt like printing money. Been chasing that high since. Glad I found another mini rocket in mvis
2021-04-27 04:02:17,wallstreetbets,"And you sound like you haven't been here before. Retard is a term of endearment. I clearly liked the OP post. Nobody's ""jelly"", I didn't sink 7 years and $80K into a stock, how could I be jealous of something I didn't attempt? That's like being jealous of Elon when I haven't launched a single rocket  

Another poster, not OP, was shitting on folks with get rich quick ideas like that isn't what this ENTIRE SUBREDDIT is about. This is ""Wallstreet BETS"" not ""Wallstreet SAFELY COLLECTING DIVIDENDS"", the gambling requirement is in the fucking title. Even OP said he wasn't being a responsible, diligent investor, he was playing with numbers and got lucky the stock got spotlighted by Kramer then picked up by WSB before the shorts killed the company. And that's awesome. I'm happy for him because this is what busting hedge shorts is about. We hear too many stories of retail guys like OP losing everything because of hedges  

If you want to be responsible and safe and not retarded, there's plenty of other subreddits already named that'll net you tiny gains and tiny losses and you'll be lucky to beat incoming hyperinflation. So dip the fuck off"
2021-04-27 11:20:54,wallstreetbets,Ah ok it was this penalty I was thinking about
2021-04-27 06:15:47,wallstreetbets,"I am the corporate oligarchy and I say OFF with your gains, guards!"
2021-04-27 06:28:01,wallstreetbets,"how much freaking money do you think engineers make? Trust me when i say, unless you are one of the most special engineers in the world (who probably has another title in the company), YOU AIN'T MAKING 500K.

Same goes for a dentist, higher paid but not quite the 500k, unless you are actually a dentist/small biz owner.

people at that low 1% are more like high end lawyers, very successful small business owners, high end doctors, mid-large company low end officers, etc."
2021-04-27 02:23:48,wallstreetbets,***Y’ALL GETTING FUCKING TAXED***™️
2021-04-27 02:39:45,wallstreetbets,Depends on where you live
2021-04-27 11:24:46,wallstreetbets,Ok... Then what do you call someone with billions? They don’t deserve to be lumped together. Ya millions is a lot of money especially 100s of millions and up but it ain’t shit compared to someone with billions.
2021-04-27 06:18:53,wallstreetbets,But how will we all stay mad if we think it through first?
2021-04-27 07:21:18,wallstreetbets,"Smh it's amazing how poorly understood the progressive tax system is even at this day and age. 

And nevermind actually understanding the application of the term ""marginal tax rate"" properly.

Everyone should try and file their own taxes once, with a calculator. You do that once you realize really quick that you're actually paying a lot less than you think you do."
2021-04-27 02:44:28,wallstreetbets,"1 MM in a boomer ETF brings you like $50.000 per year, which is enough to live decently in like 98% of the world. It’s more than the majority of the world earns. You can’t live like a millionaire tho, no Lambo for you."
2021-04-27 03:20:18,wallstreetbets,"Why not? What's the difference in having a sell order at price target and a covered call?  
With a covered call you collect the premium but you can't cancel a sell order. He's not losing more money. He's making the same money from selling shares at a price target + getting the premium for selling covered calls."
2021-04-27 01:20:11,wallstreetbets,So you’re single huh... where can I put in an application?
2021-04-27 02:20:17,wallstreetbets,"damn, yeah you are/will be set up nicely, even if this only mints you $1 million.

Still, it's only gains when you sell. Godspeed, i'm right there with you. Hopefully this can make me $1m too - but you'd be at likely 2 or 3 mill when that happens!"
2021-04-27 09:12:27,wallstreetbets,"well - if its pretax money (it sounds like the OP has a pretax 401k), then it hasn't been taxed yet, so its all taxable when he pulls it out.

If it's a roth, yes - you are correct. momey contributed isnt taxed again on withdrawal, and then the earnings on that money are tax-free after age 59.5."
2021-04-27 10:45:49,wallstreetbets,Why is MVIS a meme stock? Clearly you are new to this kiddo.
2021-04-27 13:13:44,wallstreetbets,What is DD?
2021-04-27 06:23:07,wallstreetbets,And that salt still tastes as good as it did back then on my ramen
2021-04-27 08:43:36,wallstreetbets,I believe you are right sir! The salt war ended up making everyone thirsty....hence the Boston tea party afterwards
2021-04-27 19:09:04,wallstreetbets,"Italians may have stolen the noodle from asia, but they noodle pretty good also"
2021-04-27 06:45:49,wallstreetbets,"When you combine all three (salt, lemon/lime, and salsa).... OMG."

2021-04-27 02:23:31,wallstreetbets,The thought back then was a cell phone with a Pico projector in it. Was going to be in everyone's hand. Still a possibility I guess.
2021-04-27 00:35:20,wallstreetbets,"Company 401k, their donations and mine. It was $80k built up over about 4 years."
2021-04-27 04:49:13,wallstreetbets,Dude. Loss porn is just one part of wsb. Everyone belongs here. Don't hate the man for doing good. Fucker.
2021-04-27 01:25:19,wallstreetbets,"Yes all shares, 7 long years of MVIS torment."
2021-04-27 04:27:32,wallstreetbets,"Most of it is in a 401k, so no taxes till I start making withdrawals."
2021-04-27 07:57:04,wallstreetbets,Balls out
2021-04-27 04:10:17,wallstreetbets,You type a lot. Write another 3 paragraphs and tell me again how to comment in this sub. Haha
2021-04-27 08:07:18,wallstreetbets,<laughs in sales org>
2021-04-27 08:10:06,wallstreetbets,"Lots of people that would call themselves by those titles make that kind of money through general business activities and investing over time, in addition to salaries. If you’re an engineer and end up as a VP of a company with some rental properties or other business interests you still identify as an engineer. You don’t call yourself “business guy who used to be an engineer”."
2021-04-27 03:10:54,wallstreetbets,A few.million is rich everywhere in the world. You would be the 0.01% in every country.
2021-04-27 03:41:13,wallstreetbets,"This is the such a load of shit the rich try to spoon feed to the plebs.

$2,000,000 is a crazy amount of money and makes you rich anywhere on the planet.  

Quit moving the goalposts to ""Well if you want a big house in the middle of the most expensive real estate on the planet and you somehow can't get a mortgage than $2,000,000 really isn't much""

You can put $2 million in a boring ETF and cash out for like $100,000 every year without working a minute."

2021-04-27 04:37:05,wallstreetbets,"The only difference I can see is if it's not a hard and fast price target. Maybe you have a price target of say, $50, but you don't have a sell order and want to see how it's movimg before selling."
2021-04-27 02:54:57,wallstreetbets,"Calm down there, Winkler."
2021-04-27 09:13:28,wallstreetbets,Yes was referring to the Roth IRA lol
2021-04-27 09:13:58,wallstreetbets,What would you do with your money if you hit 1mill on stocks?
2021-04-27 10:46:43,wallstreetbets,I see you post regularly on the unemployment forums.... Any more life advice to share?
2021-04-27 10:46:22,wallstreetbets,Lol shut the fuck up

2021-04-27 02:28:15,wallstreetbets,A cell phone with a projector is bullish as fuck
2021-04-27 02:52:04,wallstreetbets,"That sounds awesome, I’d love a projector in my phone."
2021-04-27 03:35:53,wallstreetbets,Great move of trusting your own notion about such a thing... N Kramer telling everyone mvis is a bad buy into. Lmao 🤣
2021-04-27 10:47:30,wallstreetbets,Exact reason I still have a MotoZ with the projector MOD...
2021-04-27 01:37:43,wallstreetbets,Excellent job!! I wish you continued success!
2021-04-27 02:27:33,wallstreetbets,Whats your plan now if you don't mind? I know its not enough to smash your ceo office door and tell him to get out of your fucking desk bitch and go fetch you a latte with some avocado toast lmao. Sorry I'm projecting my fantasy lmao.
2021-04-27 02:26:25,wallstreetbets,"where do you see it going from here? I am debating whether to sell and take gains before the coming lidar announcement on Thursday, thinking maybe this could be a little bit of a buy the rumor sell the news type of thing but then again, when you have such high short percentages, this can continue to rise for a while"
2021-04-27 02:46:16,wallstreetbets,When you left? You rolled over into a self-directed ira or something?
2021-04-27 04:16:12,wallstreetbets,The dont teach how easy 401ks are
2021-04-27 06:04:09,wallstreetbets,"When you say 401K, do you mean allocated your 401K to that stock, or that you took out a loan on your 401K, invested those funds and gradually paid yourself back?"
2021-04-27 08:56:00,wallstreetbets,That's awesome man.   Really happy for you.   I need to learn some patience like you.   The only trading I do is day trading in and out in minutes make a hundred to a few hundred a day but nothing like this!
2021-04-27 15:34:42,wallstreetbets,Did you just get out of the 401k early and eat the taxes?
2021-04-27 01:26:20,wallstreetbets,"Wow! Congrats!
Are you gonna sell? How much are you gonna realize?"
2021-04-27 11:11:28,wallstreetbets,"Congrats on your success!!! What would be your plan to avoid paying taxes as much as possible while withdrawing from 401k? Or you don't mind paying?

Also, what kind of IRA did you open?"
2021-04-27 04:11:38,wallstreetbets,"No, I'll just tell you you're blocked"
2021-04-27 12:25:10,wallstreetbets,"in that case every career track pays 500k. history teach? well i wrote a book, invested that money into stocks, got dividends and now i'm gettng 600k a year. Janitor? i bought the dip on MVIS last year, sold the 200x gains and now i'm selling covered calls on $2m worth of AMD shares.

someone who is getting paid to be an engineer is not making 500k, that was my point, unless you were a chief engineer at some startup that got stock options and struck it rich."
2021-04-27 04:55:18,wallstreetbets,"Also depends on what you mean by a couple of millies. Net worth I bet a lot more people are worth close to or more than a million than people realise, by the time you’ve accounted for houses and pensions and all that jazz."
2021-04-27 12:31:23,wallstreetbets,"If 2M is crazy what’s that make 2B?? That’s apples to oranges shit. How does $2 compare to $2,000? I’m not saying 2M isn’t a lot of money but we define rich as too low IMO."
2021-04-27 09:37:32,wallstreetbets,"But that's the thing, 100.000 per year is high middle class, you aint travelling the world with that. And If tou help family then It gets worse.  
  
For me being rich is being able to say fuck you, stop working and have your standard of living not fall."
2021-04-27 11:31:14,wallstreetbets,By that logic then lets just call millionaires millionaires then and drop the “rich” title all together since we want to speak so objectively
2021-04-27 10:47:59,wallstreetbets,"I see you just made your account and think MVIS legitimately spiked 200% and not because mad money man mentions it on TV and WSB  talks it up for a week and are super salty youre bag holding. But hey man like I said, even though you sound like a total cock I hope you at least break even."

2021-04-27 03:37:43,wallstreetbets,"[They exist](https://youtu.be/auZR8xuFVpg?t=35) but I believe the market they live in is ""Aliexpress android phones""."
2021-04-27 04:21:13,wallstreetbets,Been done by several companies
2021-04-27 04:32:53,wallstreetbets,Motorola has one that attaches and is crystal clear
2021-04-27 02:56:32,wallstreetbets,"It existed, the moto Z had an attachment with a projector."
2021-04-27 02:56:35,wallstreetbets,I talk about this tech all the time and how cool it be when the tech gets there however real use application of a mini projector with current tech is almost none minus in dark rooms. The light isn’t bright enough for general day time use to share a video with a friend on a table per-say. Mini projector would need to use 1-2 led bulbs in a phone to project a image would would equal a extremely weak low light image projected ontop of it current mini projectors are about the size of a rubix cube and not small enough to be a a phone module at the time.  While it sounds awesome and it will be when tech gets there still a decent ways off from being able to project strong clear sharp images via a phone that also doesn’t destroy battery in 30 mins tops . No too phone manufacturer will put in a half assed projector on a flagship so untill the tech is there we’ll see random Chinese brands add half assed projectors that look terrible in the meantime lol
2021-04-27 05:17:56,wallstreetbets,"You think you would until you use a cellphone projector. For example, the moto Z one that has been mentioned is only 50 lumens and a 400:1 contrast ratio so it's only going to work in a completely pitch black room and even then it's going to look like shit."
2021-04-27 02:39:52,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, to keep working because most of it is in a 401k so the penalties for tapping it is shitty (I'm 46). If I were to add another million or so though I might say fuck it and pay the penalty 😎"
2021-04-27 02:51:02,wallstreetbets,"No, the 401k has an option to transfer money Into a brokerage account."
2021-04-27 04:12:20,wallstreetbets,Haha wow. You going to go cry now?
2021-04-27 12:56:52,wallstreetbets,"I think you’d be surprised about how many dentists, business owners, and engineers included make over $500k annually. It’s not like an MVIS lottery winner from any profession. I think it’s fair that OP included these professions just before etc,, as the point was that regular people have often trained in these areas and became self made 1%ers, and they are dramatically different from super wealthy billionaires."
2021-04-27 05:49:51,wallstreetbets,Yes. Even net worth. Most people have a real disconnect with how poor people really are.
2021-04-27 12:18:49,wallstreetbets,"And you’re probably spending 20k a year on healthcare if you are buying off the marketplace, so after tax and insurance you’re bringing home like $50k"

2021-04-26 23:33:26,wallstreetbets,Tbh.  If it’s not GME you get attacked by people In the group.  I posted yesterday because I was very hopeful of today’s rally.   Didn’t think it would rocket as much as it did.  Figured it would go to low 20’s.   I posted it anyway and people made money.  I’m glad I contributed to some gains.  There is more room to go.  I’m holding steady.
2021-04-26 23:56:17,wallstreetbets,I’ll see if she can squeeze you in on Fridays.

I don't know what they make. I dont think they make profits. I never read a single piece of DD on it. I don't know what the fuck a LIDAR even is.

The only reason I threw all that money in is because Cramer told me not to buy.

Cheers, Jim."

2021-04-26 23:43:47,wallstreetbets,"You know... I still remember when MVIS was doing reverse splits to stay listed.

I guess it just goes to show you that you should try to do everything humanly possible to stay on a well regulated exchange.

Do I think MVIS is going to start forward splitting to reward all the people it fucked in the reverse splits?

Not a chance in hell.

Just remember, that's the kind of company you own when you  buy MVIS."

2021-04-26 23:30:26,wallstreetbets,"For every one diamond in the rough like MVIS, there are ten bag holders for really shitty companies who never make it lol"
2021-04-27 00:33:08,wallstreetbets,"MVIS was on pennystocks for a long Fuggin’ time. Its easy to call this a success in hindsight. But much like GME before it exploded, stocks like MVIS aren’t looked at twice until they are. 

The trick is to have your own opinion by knowing how to properly evaluate a company. A skill people even go to school to learn 🤷🏻‍♂️"
2021-04-27 00:37:19,wallstreetbets,"oh it's easy man, just google 'what is the next big stock gonna be?' and they list them all right there for ya."
2021-04-27 03:07:33,wallstreetbets,"u/Actually-Yo-Momma is right AND if someone had shown you mvis at 1.90 or below, you wouldnt have put a 5digit sum into it.

there are a lot of companies like mvis...just try your luck with SNDL for example or numerous bios. you will be bagholding for live"
2021-04-27 03:28:05,wallstreetbets,There was a lot of DD last week when it was ~$10 a share. Gotta keep up!
2021-04-27 05:34:01,wallstreetbets,Cramer said to stay away from this. So you jump on it.
2021-04-26 23:35:17,wallstreetbets,come back on 30th for juicy loss porn

2021-04-27 06:55:18,wallstreetbets,Dedication mixed with a little bit of luck. The next one is HYSR.
2021-04-27 08:57:15,wallstreetbets,That's like asking how people knew the winning lottery numbers.

2021-04-27 02:58:29,wallstreetbets,"Found this stock last year when it was floating around $1 , 
I'm into tech so I kinda know what I am looking for in a company. Seen a lot of potential after doing my DD."
2021-04-27 04:50:13,wallstreetbets,"It’s the same as asking, how the fuck did you find the numbers to win the lottery? 

You can look at all the fundamentals, all the revenue, all the cash flow and CEO sentiment, yet sometimes a stock just doesn’t pick up."
2021-04-27 06:42:40,wallstreetbets,Just buy a lot of different low cap stocks and if you're lucky one of them will moon. VC strategy.
2021-04-27 06:56:57,wallstreetbets,Membership...easy as that. I have a member ship to GME...I think. Fuck. Have to by now right?
2021-04-27 07:20:02,wallstreetbets,Good question I’m with you
2021-04-27 08:18:27,wallstreetbets,"Patience! I bought CTRM, 115.000 @ .66 and will wait.
Seems a good long-term investment. (I hope)."
2021-04-27 11:42:39,wallstreetbets,"I had +80% gain on Aston Martin. (2k in 3.6k out)
How i got that ?
I did start trading with basically no expirience in the Stock market. So i looked at something i can understand e.g. at car companies because thats what i knew how to value and found Aston Martin. Also at that Time the Stok price was heavily down. 
I think this is somewhat about how much you trust the company based on your research.
Also you have to be patient"
2021-04-27 02:39:49,wallstreetbets,I wanna know how people have 40k to drop like that
2021-04-27 03:13:04,wallstreetbets,you need to invest 2K in 10-20 of the BS 1 or less stocks. Ones has to pay right?
2021-04-27 08:43:49,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry about it, find God instead."
2021-04-27 01:00:28,wallstreetbets,Because they said it was up for sale and it was getting bought out!!! 😎
2021-04-27 06:09:31,wallstreetbets,"Ha, my avg is 1.43, looking back at my history depresses me. I had orders in for .29 twice that I canceled on MVIS, but I haven’t sold yet any of the ones I bought. Only have 202, +1,968% gains. Still not selling."

2021-04-27 10:53:00,wallstreetbets,Who bet on GME based on evaluations?
2021-04-27 17:38:08,wallstreetbets,"But MVIS' success wasn't based on the company. It was based on wishful thinking, rabid speculation, and FOMOers."

2021-04-27 07:20:57,wallstreetbets,"Really depends on how you read it. In the US a lotto drawing at 10 tonight could easily end (and they frequently do end) with no winner making all tickets bought before 10 tonight worthless.

Even if you bought the number of tickets to have the exact odds covered you could still lose because your tickets could have duplicate numbers.

So to win you'd have to buy a ticket for every possible number combination. Even then while you would win, you aren't guaranteed to be the only winner. So even doing this on a billion dollar jackpot could be operating at a severe net loss (even more so than the  person was implying with the joke.)"
2021-04-27 07:52:24,wallstreetbets,that is the point...
2021-04-27 07:25:07,wallstreetbets,">So to win you'd have to buy a ticket for every possible number combination.

aka „every ticket“?

But you got my whole point: You can be certain to never miss a great penny stock by investing in every penny stock, but it’s a shit strategy and you‘ll only lose money."
2021-04-27 07:27:00,wallstreetbets,"This here isn't the lottery, It's a CASINO"
2021-04-27 11:15:18,wallstreetbets,">aka,,everyticket""?

Hence why I started with ""Depends how you read it.""

There is no limit on the amount of tickets being sold. So physically you can not buy ""every"" ticket. You can however cover every possible outcome, but that is technically different even if it is a potential perceived meaning of saying buy every ticket.

If the odds of winning a lotto are 323:1 then in normal terms, buying 323 tickets means you bought every ticket. You are guaranteed a winner. But the way state lottos work, you could buy 646 tickets and still not have a winner. It would be incredibly unlucky, but still possible.

You could own every lotto ticket bought for megamillions in every state that is part of the game, and if unlucky enough, not win the drawing.

tl/dr: there are multiple readings of ""every ticket"" in this case leaving ample room for confusion on what exactly you mean and how applicable it is."

-not financial advice"
2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Remember Gamestop's share offering? It closed today. Remember when GameStop mentioned it would sell a maximum of 3,500,000 shares, or $1bln, whichever came first? Many did some reverse maths and determined they *MUST* expect the share price to hit $1b/3.5m=**$285.71428571**. Others said ""or just 1m shares at $1,000 each."" Still others (now this is the group I belong to) said this means fuck all for price expectations. This had nothing to do with GameStop peeking through the veil and determining a short squeeze was imminent and everything to do with seizing the opportunity to raise cash.

Welp, the [3.5m shares came and went today](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestops-latest-big-day-picks-up-steam-after-hours-with-551-million-stock-offering-11619474789), and the price went UP.

[Cramer actually sided with AMC and GameStop](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/jim-cramer-amc-gamestop-share-offerings-are-longterm-positives.html) about this being a good move, although we saw the sentiment on Reddit having great disdain for AMC's version and overall the sentiment was a majority positive for GameStop and realizing RC's vision, although [GME stock price took a **-12% hit** when this was initially announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/05/gamestop-shares-drop-12percent-after-announcing-plan-to-sell-up-to-3point5-million-shares.html).

GME is currently **up +12%** for the day (coincidence? *Cohencidence?*) and an additional +9% in AH with a peak that tickled the idea of breaking $200 at around... get ready for this... 4:20pm.

Edit: removed additional details about AMC as it's irrelevant to the topic."
2021-04-27 05:07:26,wallstreetbets,WSB allowing GME to be mentioned again is certainly a sign!
2021-04-27 03:15:16,wallstreetbets,"The big guns didn't get a huge payday for their share offering with GME.  AMC saw undeserved huge paydays for top brass.  That's a pretty big difference.

One company wants to use the money.  The other just wants to line pockets.  One leader doesn't want any rewards until the work is done.  The other wants rewards now despite not earning anything.  We're following a leader here, not a ticker."

At best they’ll have a nice rally post-pandemic and then settle back into where they were - a mediocre movie theater chain. Their leadership has no vision for growth or improvement of the company. They just give themselves bonuses.

Look at what Ryan Cohen is doing, and the millions of people throwing everything they have into GME and it’s still been fucking difficult. The institutions plan has always been divide and conquer. AMC is just another distraction that’s some how still fooling people. Could you imagine if everyone sold their AMC shares today and bought GME... we’d all be millionaires. 

Short squeeze or long term... I have researched both extensively, and GME is the meme stock to own. Even if all you can afford is one share of GME, it’s gonna be worth it."

If only people would stop being greedy, know that amc is a lost cause when their executives are greedy fuckers, and pile into GME, then they may actually realise what a great investment it is, in addition to the potential acutally possible, realistic short squeeze. Fucking hell.

2021-04-27 02:00:49,wallstreetbets,"Fuck these rabid pricks downvoting you. Yes, plenty of people have shorted GME recently & have made money. I will explain.

It all depends on the price they shorted at. If you were to borrow 1,000 shares & sold them at $200 but the price dropped to $150, you buy back all the shares to return for a profit of $50K. If the price went $50 the other way to $250, you would lose $50K buying the shares back to return.

What happened here with GME is straight out of a fucking movie though. Very long story."

2021-04-27 13:01:01,wallstreetbets,Technically yes. However the theory is that retail owns more than the float (maybe even multiple times the float) and therefore 3.5m isnt hurting the squezze at all.

I know enough to understand the WSB is about YOLO'ing into something, DD inspired or not, and then sharing that sweet, sweet gain porn, or baring your shame and posting that sweet, sweet loss porn.  

Anyone really hoping to make significant money in WSB is kinda missing the point, I expect."
2021-04-27 07:56:57,wallstreetbets,"I understand, but my point is GME is a good play regardless if you believe in the squeeze (which I do). And I think GME has a greater potential to squeeze AND grow organically long term, than AMC does. 

With GME I feel little to no risk because I truly believe in the company and their leadership long term. I do not believe in AMC so I view it as a highly risky play dependent on a long shot chance at a squeeze. 

If you actually believe in AMC leadership, then by all means. More power to you."
2021-04-27 12:17:12,wallstreetbets,"An AMC short squeeze seems really unlikely. There are just too many shares out there and not enough demand to drive price up fast enough to trigger it. Furthermore the short interest ratio is less than 1 day. It has too much daily volume.

Then add to that AMC still has around 40m shares left to sell this year under it's old agreement, and then the vote on approving another 500m shares going forward. Even if something got rolling AMC itself would cash in and stop it.

2021-04-27 02:23:20,wallstreetbets,"By logic. I don’t understand why you’re so hung up on this. Could someone with a short position buy back shares randomly whenever they want? Of course. 

GameStop sold shares into the market, not to any one individual. 

If someone has a short position and over the past few weeks why would they be closing it? We’ve been trading sideways and melting downward. 

Why would you close your short position over the past few weeks while GameStop was selling shares to raise capital. You wouldn’t. No one was aware, volume was completely trash. Price action was trading sideways and going down. That’s what a short seller wants."

2021-04-27 09:24:26,wallstreetbets,What about this: Retail investors are more likely to throw some cash at GME in hopes of a short squeeze over AMC because GME has the added benefit of having solid fundamentals. That was the deciding factor for me since “worst case I end up with shares in a company with strong potential”
2021-04-27 15:00:29,wallstreetbets,"Agreed.  A lot of people don't seem to realize that the video game industry revenue has surpassed the movie industry and North American sports combined.  The top 10, Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, EA, etc have been at the top for awhile.  The video game industry is oversaturated and needs to be consolidated, the fat needs to be trimmed.  It was only a matter of time before the video game industry leaders started making big moves again, and GameStop is the catalyst.  If GameStop can make a deal with (or acquire) EA, ATVI, or Steam, or whatever company they feel fits their vision of the future, then the video game industry will change dramatically.  People also underestimate how important the video game industry is to Gen X, Gen Y, and Gen Z, Globally!  Right now they don't understand it, they don't see it, and they will be slow to catch on, if at all.

And wtf does that mean they sold it to the market not individuals?  The “individual” could be buying in blocks.  If we knew how much went strictly to retail we wouldn’t have needed to speculate on share ownership for the last four months.  

At a certain point people are just making up shit to explain things. Saying “3.5 million bought up by shorts to cover isn’t enough to cover everything” is magnitudes different from “literally all of it went to retail.”   

It’s weird how looking for things that aren’t speculation is chastised here now."

2021-04-27 10:59:42,wallstreetbets,I could see that being a decent play. hope it continues to work out
2021-04-27 10:04:37,wallstreetbets,"Obviously, but what if it doesn't squeeze? There is a decent chance gamestop holds above $100 a share regardless of squeeze, some would say an even higher share price if they move to e-commerce or use the 900 million in cash they have to transform their model successfully. If you hold AMC for a squeeze you could actually be holding to 0, GME not so much."
2021-04-27 12:40:04,wallstreetbets,They would use dark pool trading if they wanted to short term hide the orders to  avoid influencing the stock price. But that is counter productive for what short sellers are trying to do and that volume/short gets reported shortly after the trade executes anyway.
2021-04-27 08:47:54,wallstreetbets,"Ha sorry, it was aimed more toward the lurkers downvoting my comment without giving any reasoning! - good point too. I believe GME with Cohen on board has much better leadership and I’m deeply invest in both companies. However, post-squeeze, will GameStop be a company that’s still valued at $150+? Even with the e-commerce king Cohen himself, I think it’d be pretty overvalued."
2021-04-27 09:26:18,wallstreetbets,"To be honest, after this ‘squeeze’ GameStop won’t be anywhere near $150 at true value. AMC on the other hand were trading at $20 pre-pandemic so if they’re able to continue their high grossing box office numbers and pay off some of their debt, they’re probably a better post-squeeze play than GME?.."

2021-04-27 00:29:59,wallstreetbets,The way this is
2021-04-27 03:21:39,wallstreetbets,"If HFs bought shares at market to cover, then sure?  But so could literally anyone.  That's what he's pointing out.  It wasn't any kind of deal made to HFs, it was a share offering.  They sold shares at market price to the open market to raise capital.  It's not a difficult concept.  If HFs happened to cover when it was happening, then they covered.  If not, then they didn't.  But if they did cover, chances are we would have seen the price go *up*, not down until the news broke that the share offering was already done.  Why?  Because *HFs have to buy at market price to get shares from the open market, driving the price up*.

There's the logic.  This 3.5m share offering most likely didn't help HFs cover."
2021-04-27 02:43:24,wallstreetbets,"Lmao you just make no sense.
Apply LOGIC to the situation.

Omg did those 3.5 million shares they sold go to shorts?! They can buy shares too right guys!?

Do you not understand how stupid that statement sounds? You’re literally asking if short sellers can buy shares off the open market.

Fucking OBVIOUSLY that’s the entire point of a squeeze, they are forced to buy the shares off the open market to cover.

It MAKES NO LOGICAL SENSE for shorts to have been covering DURING DOWNWARD trading weeks when GameStop sold their shares. 

Over 30 million shares traded last week and that is a low volume week. GameStop made this announcement that they intended to do this almost a month ago, they’ve been selling these in smaller blocks over the course of weeks. 

And before you go zomg that’s just all speculation!?

Its literally the logical play when a company or any massive position is wound down and is how companies do these stock offerings. 

They had an ATM offering which is literally the definition of that, so not speculation.
Could a shorter have, for some nonsensical reason and with no real volume, covered a small short position during the period of the past month (where the stock price has been trending downward and their shorts are gaining value mind you). 

Obviously yes, anyone can buy shares.

Is it insanely foolish and downright absurd to think a meaningful or even any chunk of those shares sold by GameStop went to short sellers? Yes, you literally are making an illogical claim and claiming anything else as speculation."

If I set a buy order limit of $100, the buy order will trigger for a max of $100.

Myself I have found limit orders not very useful unless I'm not able to pay attention for a couple hrs.

Like, today I set a buy limit order for mvis at market open for $20 and went back to sleep for an hr. When I woke up it was at $22.90 and I didn't own any new shares. Sad panda. So I did a market buy at 22.90, paid 22.75, and then it went up to 28.xx. I could have made 20% more today if I'd just used a market buy at open.

Also this is my dumb question. I tried to buy on the pre market last night, in ibkr, and it wouldn't let me toggle the ""ah"" button so I got up at open. But I paid $4 a share more as a result, anyone know why I couldn't shop in the premarket this morning when I have been able to in the past (on other stocks)?"

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why Tencent Music Entertainment (NYSE:TME) is in Store for a Strong Recovery # TME

Tencent Music Entertainment is a company that develops music streaming services for the Chinese market. After dropping over 30% in March and slowly bleeding off since, I believe it's in the perfect spot to make back a large amount of that loss.

# So why did TME drop 34% in march?

On March 24th [the SEC announced](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-53) that they would be taking steps to enforce stricter financial oversight of foreign-owned companies. This meant that violators could be delisted from US exchanges. Being a Chinese company, fears of delisting caused the stock to plummet.

# What has happened since?

The following Sunday, Tencent Music [announced a 1 Billion dollar buyback](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-music-announces-record-1b-053445707.html) amid the selloff. The stock continued to decline into the first few weeks of April.

However on April 21th things began to turn around.

# So why is it a good buy now?

**Technical Analysis:**

https://preview.redd.it/2grvgjg79mv61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7feec691c2d2c3108edbc94f4c49b50188b4fd7

TME closed at 19.44 today off the back of 5 straight green days. Today it finally crossed the 200 MA which should provide strong support when moving higher.

Looking up at the RSI we see a sharp bounce off 30 coinciding with the rise in share price. This still has plenty of room to climb as its only at 44 right now. This is bullish for sure, showing a strong upward trend and the stock rejecting being 'oversold'.

Looking down now at the MACD crossing over the signal line again coinciding with the rise in share price. And just like with the RSI the MACD is low right now providing lots of room to grow. This again is bullish as the crossing of the signal line can be the start of a bigger move. We can further see this with the MACD histogram beginning to rise.

**Fundamental Analysis:**

The key to this stocks strong fundamentals is that the reason it dropped doesn't have anything to do with why the stock dropped in March. It dropped over fears of a potential delisting, but this seemed to be an overreaction. Now that fears have died down, the strong fundamentals of this stock can drive its price back upward.

Tencent Music is a joint venture between Spotify and Tencent, both large and successful companies in their own right.  They create a strong partnership where Spotify provides the music expertise, and Tencent helps them navigate the Chinese market.

Tencent Music has consistently met earnings and turned a profit year after year. Q1 earnings are on May 17th which could provide further support if strong.

# Conclusion

TME is super undervalued following a headline that doesn't change the company's fundaments at all. All signs point to a strong move upward in the following weeks.

**Not financial advice, do you own DD.**

**Position: None currently, planning to buy tomorrow morning.**"
2021-04-26 22:14:36,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure this was one of the archego liquidated stock, that's why it crashed along with VIAC, DISC. People still scare of potential block sale perhaps. It may boom after reporting earnings next week"
2021-04-26 21:46:36,wallstreetbets,"Good DD. I’m gonna research their market cap and financials on yahoo finance before going in tho

Update: 31 bn market cap. They made 29 bn revenue, 9 bn in gross profit in 2020. Have 31 bn in total assets. 15 bn in total liabilities gives them a healthy 0.48 debt ratio (meaning company has less risk). Average analyst price target of this stock is $28. Current price is $19. I definitely think it’s a buy, earnings coming up in two weeks. Only risk I see is it’s a Chinese owned company but it’s no different than alibaba, ten cent entertainment. Short term play plausible"

They also have serious competition In the big three (or four) in the music industry: Sony, Warner, and UMG. They all want a slice of that China pie and will suck as many weiners needed to do so.

I mentioned four because the fourth largest company in the industry,  BMG, is making moves to enter the market. They are doing so with a partnership with Netease, TMEs biggest competitor and also Chinese backed.

Tme isnt a bad play but you need to be aware that China can fuck with the share price whenever they want and they have a decreasing moat."

2021-04-26 23:11:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the giant drop off was more related to the Arachego liquidation than fears of being delisted, but both happened around the same time so it's probably a combination of the two. The initial cliff dive occurred AH 3/23 and pre market 3/24, which is when the liquidation sell off happened. Then the stock continued to bleed down over the coming days, not quite as violently, and the SEC adopted the law that weekend, the 25th I think.  We did see drops in prices for all Chinese company stocks which was related to the SEC adoption, just not quite as bad as Tencent, because this news was already largely priced in. The law was signed by Trump in December 2020, so it's not like it came out of nowhere. The Archegos liquidation was the main catalyst in the Tencent sell off."

You using Reddit right now is part of this. Reddit is partially owned by Chinese investors. 

If you're going to take this view point against investing in chinese companies then don't be selective. Get off Reddit. Throw out literally every piece of gadget or item you have in your house and never buy another one.

I also find it hilirious people talk about national security when it comes to china. Like your own government isn't spying on you and other govenrments around the world aren't spying on your. Private companies ""owned"" or ""Based"" out of USA are spying on you but no problem there i guess."

From there I’ll look at when the volume peaked, which I’ll then pull up the order book at that time and look at the orders that went in. If I see a bunch of large orders within a few seconds of each other, you can usually tell it was entered as one order executed through multiple exchanges. Hope this helps"
2021-04-27 18:53:27,wallstreetbets,"Buying their products doesn’t put them on Wall Street, investing in them does. If they are in foreign exchanges then they make significantly more money than if they’re not. 

Let’s say I buy a phone made in China but owned by an American brand: vast majority of that money winds up in the US and only a little stays in China for covering the factory costs. However if you invest in a Chinese company then only a little stays in whatever country you bought the shares through, but most of it winds up in China. This is a huge source of foreign income for the CCP. 

I cannot stress enough that there’s almost no way to live your life without buying stuff made in China unless you go and live in the woods like a caveman. However that doesn’t mean you should go all in and fund their dodgy practices by investing in CCP owned companies like tencent."

2021-04-26 21:54:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man more room for growth imo

AT&T's book value is 22/sh, priced at ~30/sh right now. I know they have a supercharged dividend (6.9%), but the CEO straight up said on earnings day that his priority is to get the stock price up ([yt link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzvHkPxrl6g&t=2m39s)), 

Full disclosure: my calls 5xed on earnings day"
2021-04-27 01:11:37,wallstreetbets,"Netflix is fucked. Planning to do buybacks instead of investing it into creating new original content? Disney+ is gonna eat their lunch.

Just like Reddit, the streaming company with the best and most OC will get the most eyeballs."
2021-04-26 22:34:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I've heard about that, that some of the subs are from bundles. Afaik they still make money from it so I'm not too worried.  Still, any idea what fraction of these gains are from that?"
2021-04-27 03:06:44,wallstreetbets,"Not sure, I'd be interested to know as well."
2021-04-26 22:18:48,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-04-26 22:43:20,wallstreetbets,"yeah im optimistic, ceo literally said on Friday that his priority is to get stock price up lmao

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzvHkPxrl6g&t=2m39s"
2021-04-26 22:41:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah and the same was said 5 years ago when prime and Hulu were its competitors.  Their original content is what will keep them at the top.

They pretty much control the documentary market which is huge since its low cost high reward.  I have no idea what they paid for tiger king but I imagine its a drop in the bucket compared to what they earned.  Same with making a murderer, night stalker etc."
2021-04-27 05:10:33,wallstreetbets,"the odd thing about those new US streaming services is that they never make it abroad, whilst Netflix is doing a lot to even produce content in local countries."
2021-04-27 01:19:52,wallstreetbets,"Yes they have ~$346 billion in total liabilities but had free cash flow of ~$27 billion in 2020. So they are still bringing in a healthy amount of cash and that's why they pay a fat dividend. They are just jacked to the tits on historically cheap money. So if they just dumped every free dollar into debt (which they wouldn't do because that would mean taking away the dividend) it would take roughly 13 years to pay off all liabilities. T took a hit with everybody else last March and they are still down around last March's price. Disney got the Disney+ bump, Netflix got the stay at home bump, why isn't T getting credit for HBOmax?"
2021-04-26 21:56:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that's why I like it, more room for growth in the stock"
2021-04-27 05:51:57,wallstreetbets,Their international original content is really good. Got people reading subtitles that never would have before.
2021-04-26 22:42:46,wallstreetbets,Uh their entire documentary section which is lightyears ahead of anyone else's and costs pennies on the dollar to license and produce.
2021-04-27 03:07:04,wallstreetbets,Haha what do you watch it on?
2021-04-26 21:28:52,wallstreetbets,Cuz everyone already got a Netflix
2021-04-27 03:14:34,wallstreetbets,"I'm looking at the potential growth and it looks better than netflix atm.

HBO subscribers get HBO Max at no extra cost ([bi link](https://www.businessinsider.com/hbo-go-vs-hbo-now-vs-hbo-max)), they're not double counted"
2021-04-27 11:41:57,wallstreetbets,"Definitely, I just think HBO has more growth potential, not yet seen in their stock"
2021-04-26 22:02:22,wallstreetbets,Tijuana
2021-04-26 23:01:21,wallstreetbets,Almost every show at Lincoln Square sold out
2021-04-26 22:34:35,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the theater business will probably be the most affected from COVID.  People will travel again, people will eat out again but going to a movie theater and spending 50 bucks on a couple of tickets and some food when you can just watch at home with an HBO max sub.  Its not going to kill them all but it'll be a niche business soon enough."
2021-04-27 06:54:43,wallstreetbets,"Netflix has been trash for years. Since they brought on a former president to help shove his agenda down the throats of viewers the quality of content has tanked. I mean, the whole cascade really started to pick up steam when they had the new bill nye show be a singing dance party trying to teach kids about anal sex and how sodomy is cool. 🎶*cuz my sex junk is so ooh ah ahhh*🎶"
2021-04-27 05:12:01,wallstreetbets,think the stock will do well?
2021-04-26 22:46:11,wallstreetbets,"See I thought the same thing and call me crazy, but I think the quality of their content has gone down. They do have great documentaries and I think that really pushed many to get it (specifically Tiger King and Don't F With Cats). The question is, can they keep it up?"
2021-04-26 23:23:04,wallstreetbets,"I'm bullish on netflix.  They have more subscribers outside the US at this point and are investing heavily in non-fiction content (reality shows, documentaries, etc.).  There is a ton of growth potential if you look at them as a global media company rather than an American movie studio.  People need to bear in mind the content we can watch in the US is a fraction of the actual content that is available globally.  They are run by the best minds in the entertainment and tech industry and I personally see them hitting $1000 per share in 5-7 years...maybe sooner."
2021-04-26 23:09:58,wallstreetbets,"Docos and foreign and original tv shows are theirs. They can’t afford $200m plus for a great movie and now every studio has a streaming service, few good movies will be on Netflix. Was anybody even getting Netflix for movies before the pandemic?"
2021-04-26 21:30:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah better growth opportunities for HBO
2021-04-27 09:47:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying they are double counted, I'm saying that they include HBO subscribers that NEVER use their streaming service to make it appears as though their streaming service is growing faster.  No doubt that a smaller marketshare will grow faster.  I think HBO would be a much more interesting investment when/if spun off from T."
2021-04-26 22:04:00,wallstreetbets,thank you

2021-04-26 23:05:01,wallstreetbets,"Streaming is for people who want to stay home and watch a small screen, move theaters are for people who want to go out and watch ona giant screen. I could have watched GvK at home for free but I paid to go see it at AMC IMAX. $50 is cheap AF compared to other going out activities."
2021-04-27 02:21:34,wallstreetbets,"Holly wood will not allow movie theaters to go anywhere with ticket sales, insurance set companies, and active actor roles, streaming services rely on the safe income of non-pirateable experiences in theaters. Also its avg'd a price of 9 $ a ticket during a time where people are wanting to get out and re experience the world, this surge is share price,  and liquidity is gonna allow AMC to pivot to other buisness models, WHILE EVERY OTHER THEATER IN AMERICA SHUTS DOWN

YOU ALL FORGET PIRACY IS A CONCERN OF STREAMING"
2021-04-27 08:54:21,wallstreetbets,"Stock looks decent I think, it's seen as a boomer dividend stock. I'm more looking at long term calls since theyre priced cheaply.

And apparently alot of people actually watch it."
2021-04-26 23:33:12,wallstreetbets,"Have you used it? I did. SUPER SLOW. It crashed all my Samsung TV apps and couldn't watch Netflix or Hulu or You Tube. I got pissed when HBOMax offered 3 months thru Direct TV for free and I got charged from day one.

Got really bored of their content and when I canceled and deleted app, everything else on TV was perfect. They got a way to go. I won't be a customer, at least not now."
2021-04-27 10:30:59,wallstreetbets,"T bought Warner Media for about 100 billion, with a market cap of 230 billion the HBO play is a pretty big part. I think this is attractive just because of how much it's beat down.

Who is buying HBO in the last quarter and not using the streaming service?"
2021-04-27 09:01:46,wallstreetbets,how far out are you picking them up for?
2021-04-26 23:40:15,wallstreetbets,"Damn

30.5 and 31.5 for may 7"
2021-04-26 23:52:09,wallstreetbets,"Not a bad idea but their app is the worst. They need to fix it. I have heard from many different platforms. It may be a long term hunt but I can get all my content from other things if it doesn't work half the time and I have to cold boot my Smart TV just to use any other apps. 

Unplug from the wall....not just restart. What a pain. Never had again and it has been 3 months with and 3 months without."

2021-04-26 23:53:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah i feel that, the shit service is just more room for growth opportunity

especially if theyve done this week with this many issues lol"
2021-04-27 09:19:32,wallstreetbets,"months out is probably better, my position is not based on anything except the strong earnings and the momentum that i hope will hold for the next little while"
2021-04-27 00:00:43,wallstreetbets,"I have 3 Samsung Smart TV's and maybe that is the issue with the app.

The whole Direct TV overcharging....uggh, but I still own $5k of At&t stock that owns direct TV and has license with HBO and HBOMax so there's that.

At&t pays a good quarterly dividend so my money waves hello once every 3 months."

2021-04-27 14:40:31,wallstreetbets,Uhhhh
2021-04-27 07:35:53,wallstreetbets,"Basically without getting too complicated options give you the power to either buy or sell 100 shares at a strike price by paying a premium for the contract.

So say stock a is at one dollar even and you think it could go up to 2 dollars in say a month.  So instead of buying 100 shares you buy a call expiring in one months time for the $2 strike price for lets say an .08 premium per share so .08x100 is 8 bucks.  Your breakeven price would be the 2.08.  2 for the strike plus what you paid per share on the contract.  So anything above that 2.08 at expiration each penny would net you one dollar per value over what you paid for the contract at expiration or if you think the stock still has running room you could exercise the option and pay 200 for the 100 shares.  

Now a put works the opposite way.  It gives you the ability to sell 100 shares at the strike price if it gets below it at expiration.

This is about as basic as you can get. The beautiful thing is you can just trade contracts short term if you think a stock is going up or down in a short period of time without having it get to the strike price.  The negative about options is if its nowhere near the strike price on the day of expiration congrats you lost all the money you put into the contract.  

Also it can get really wonky if the volatility on the stock is high ie why gamestop calls and puts are priced stupidly high compared to similarly priced companies.  To give you an idea the last time gamestop shot up over 200 I bought puts expiring on May 30th for a 2 dollar price.  Basically no fucking chance of reaching that.  Paid 10 bucks a pop for them just to test something.  Well gamestop goes up and lo and behold I unloaded 4 of them for 15 a piece."

2021-04-26 20:59:55,wallstreetbets,"I don't know of many stocks that will keep going up, but if you believe it'll go up even just a couple of dollars it is still worth making those couple dollars correct? I saw a chart floating around a week or so ago about if MVIS gets bought out and at what price what the expected share value would be. The lowest I saw was $60, if you bought at $30 tomorrow you would be doubling your money. You would just have fewer shares than you would if you bought earlier but the saying better late than never if you believe the stock will continue."
2021-04-26 22:22:15,wallstreetbets,Earnings never moved btw. Loving MVIS but thats incorrect

2021-04-27 11:21:16,wallstreetbets,Just bought in
2021-04-27 15:15:31,wallstreetbets,Also picked up 30 6/18 calls. split between $12 and $13.
2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"2x to 3x For ""X"" aka US Steel Corp. This one has been silently flying under the radar for a little bit. However, I still think there is room for this to continue going up to $50 to $70 or potentially higher. Even based on the 5 year chart, it could see at least $45. Short interest in the company is 12% and I am not saying at all that it is a short squeeze play, but I thought I would mention it. 

&#x200B;

The background is I work for a construction company who frequently uses steel based products. My boss and I got to talking about a crazy increase of 50% to 100% on prices for products we use on a daily basis. I called two of our main suppliers to confirm this and they did. So long story short, I could see steel based companies following the same trend as lumber throughout the year as demand goes up. 

&#x200B;

""**Steel** is in short supply in the **United States** and prices are surging. Unfilled orders for **steel** in the last quarter were at the highest level in five years, while inventories were near a 3-1/2-year low, according to data from the Census Bureau. "" - Reuters 2/23/2021

&#x200B;

""X"" has been on a 6 month rise and I wish I had tracked it sooner. Take it for what you will. I figured I would share the information."

2021-04-26 21:59:08,wallstreetbets,"I think miners and refinerys are solid plays , but i feel you need to keep updated constantly.

In this weekends thread i saw someone mentioning recicling so im left wondering if scrap metal companies is a 5head or a dumb play compared to buying miners. Im also not sure if they would benefit from this as much or not bcause they need to buy the scrap too i guess to process and sell it instead of mining it from earth, but defenitly would love if you guys shared some thoughts in this deviation from original play."
2021-04-26 20:37:49,wallstreetbets,r/vitards is this way sir
2021-04-26 20:40:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah check out the Vitards group here. We’re all making a ton of money on steel and will continue to. Look into MT...international exposure, vertically integrated, etc = moon trip."

2021-04-27 03:06:10,wallstreetbets,Jerry 'the king' Lawler held the USWA championship title 28 times.
2021-04-27 07:53:50,wallstreetbets,Blue Horseshoe says so
2021-04-27 01:31:17,wallstreetbets,"prices for finished steel products have pretty much tripled across the board since their lows during covid and haven’t shown any sign of dropping. Futures are elevated 40% above historical averages through Q1 2022. There’s no sign of demand slowing down, and reopening nations passing infrastructure bills as post-covid stimulus and green energy initiatives will only keep things hot.

That staying power in high pricing is ***not baked in.***

Steel producer’s overhead is pretty stable outside of shipping and feedstock (iron ore) pricing - companies that are vertically integrated upstream (across Ore) and downstream (across shipping) will see their margins EXPLODE without realizing too much overhead expansion.

Enter ***$CLF,*** the largest flat rolled steel producer and ONLY electrical steel producer in the US (integrated upstream, and largely insulated from shipping due to supplying domestically) and ***$MT,*** the largest steel producer in the world (integrated both up and downstream).

Both of these companies have a license to print money for the next 12+ months. This is only just getting started.

CLF projects $4 BILLION in EBITDA this year. Their market cap is 9 billion. They are going to make half their market cap in cash in a SINGLE calendar year. Think about that."
2021-04-27 08:13:13,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, the good ole “priced in” phrase. Research some fam"
2021-04-27 00:38:41,wallstreetbets,My shares agree with this.
2021-04-27 16:56:07,wallstreetbets,"Schnitzer, CMC, and others do a lot of scrap. Gotta look at who is vertically integrated and who is not, to see who will suffer from high iron ore prices."
2021-04-27 00:08:54,wallstreetbets,"They aren’t ready for r/Vitards !

They’re still apes, damnit!!

2021-04-27 00:11:13,wallstreetbets,He’s keeping the tariffs in place and even Chinese prices are skyrocketing right now
2021-04-26 21:54:13,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn’t say so, it looks even from a technical standpoint it has room to run. The market only recently started to react IMO if I’m just now hearing about insane price increases of steel based products."
2021-04-27 11:39:17,wallstreetbets,"Look at historical charts for steel stocks in 2008, and even 2018. This current super cycle we are in is unprecedented, demand is through the roof, steel futures are not slowing down. 

And for CLF specifically, their annual EBITDA will be damn near its market cap. They’ve made huge accuisitions the past year and are now a vertically integrated steel maker. 

I think steel continues the trend until at least Q4 this year, and I believe it can last even longwr"

2021-04-27 18:37:24,wallstreetbets,"I've been looking at schnitzer, cmc and lkq. by vertically integrated you mean they may have also iron ore mines apart from scrapeyards and smelteries and stuff right?

Or would just doing the refining or steel be enough as they can grow margins bcause iron ore increases and they widen the spreads of steel even more?"
2021-04-27 01:09:05,wallstreetbets,We aren't ready for them
2021-04-27 00:16:10,wallstreetbets,"Not sure where you've been, but I've been hearing about steel/wood/construction materials prices going up for quite a while now (probably for about the same time as the stock's been running up, conveniently). So I kinda gotta agree with some of the other replies -- I don't think it's a bad play at all, but I think its biggest moves already happened."

2021-04-27 00:07:31,wallstreetbets,Meme land up in here. They aren’t looking at big words like “Vertical Integration” 🙊🙉🙈
2021-04-27 01:11:25,wallstreetbets,"Disagree completely 


Clf trades at a pe of like 4, is the largest integrated us steel company and is conservatively issuing guidance based on steel spot prices of 1000, which futures have already eclipsed by like 40%

Regardless, the press is great and as I said the stock is undervalued. I see resistance at 10-10.50. Will probably unload there and look for potential re-entry."

You need your GME shares to be on in “cash” and not on “margin” if it’s on “margin” you need to call then and they can move it for you +18003433548 (it was a 13min call for me)

If you have a margin account it’s likely you could be on an Option level above 2. You must be 2 or below to be on cash or you cannot vote. If you need to be on level 4 (that allows you to do naked call/put options) you need to create 2nd trading account for fidelity with level 2.

2021-04-26 22:43:29,wallstreetbets,They also spike to 21 dollars. The company is doing a restructure. Instead of focusing on phones they are focus on building cellular towers. They already have contracts with t-mobile sprint and at&t. Not only that they are working with China largest cellphone company and building towers there. They are going to have a good reliable income in the near future. Also they are working with NASA to launch first cellular tower on the moon so we can have better communication up there if we ever go back. I researched a lot of materials on them and I believe it's going to be a good company in the long run.

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE: EW) Q1 Earnings and Medical Device Stock Discussion **EW Q1 Results Beat Street View, Lifts Outlook**

Facts from the Earnings report – **Revenue** & **EPS**

The revenue for the quarter ended at $1.22 Billion. Beat market expectation of $1.16 by 60 Million \* (+8% YoY). The EPS for the quarter ended at $0.54. Beat market expectation of $0.47 by $0.07.

Guidance for full-year 2021 for sales of $4.9-5.3 Billion. Adj EPS forecast increased to $2.07-$2.27 from $2.00-2.20.

Guidance for Q2 sales between $1.25-1.33 Billion. Adj EPS forecast $0.54-$0.60.

Commenting on the quarter, CEO Michael Mussallem said, ""Structural heart procedures increased as we progressed through the winter months, and our sales growth this quarter was better-than-expected. Although we anticipate the effects of the pandemic will impact structural heart patients in the near term, we have continued confidence in our positive 2021 outlook."".

The company reported global TAVR sales of $792 million, a year-over-year increase of 7 percent on a reported basis. Surgical Structural Heart sales for the quarter were $213 million, up 10 percent from last year.

**Discussion**Edwards Lifesciences is a leading medical devices company, sitting in a similar niche to Abbott (ABT), Medtronic (MDT), and Bristol-Meyers Squibb (BMY). Of all the companies aforementioned, EW trades at the highest earnings multiple and the lowest market cap. Therefore, we must consider what properties EW possesses that justify such a high multiple.

Based on the facts from the earnings report, EW will see low-double-digit revenue growth across its entire revenue line, likely for the next 5 years (our chosen time horizon for predicting earnings). In fact, management talked at length about increasing market penetration in emerging markets; considering EW's specialization in late-stage cardiac replacement and monitoring products (valves, monitors, stents, etc), the likely target market will be high-income, aging demographics, with Japan immediately coming to mind.

At a glance, this would immediately justify the higher multiple; longer lifespans and a worsening obesity epidemic will inevitably mean more old people and more customers. This stability is the lynchpin of EW's topline and means that short of a catastrophe that disproportionally targets the elderly, revenues will continue to remain stable. This is also why EW posts such high-performance metrics compared to the industry. A stable market of stable products enables continual margin improvements. In the model, in fact, while the 5-year revenue CAGR is 17%, the EPS CAGR is a whopping 27%.

&#x200B;

[Valuation and 2026 EPS](https://preview.redd.it/7hcdrduywlv61.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe4afa5a4adf26eb709891f0889b87640f9ee817)

**and yet, the stock requires a whopping 31.5x terminal eps multiplier to justify its current price.**

*Perhaps competitive analysis will do the trick? Let's look at Abbott Laboratories (I also cover this)*

Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT), is a far larger company, with a far larger capitalization, and a more extensive portfolio. It also offers an entire segment of products dedicated to Cardiac, products related to Heart Failure, Vascular (valves), Structural Heart, and Rythm Management (pacemakers). Even considering EW's leading position in the Cardiac industry, using the same assumptions given by management, ABT's segment will comprise 31% of its medical devices segment and 13% of its total revenues. Certainly, ABT's management is capable, and within such an industry, diversified extensively into diagnostics, nutrition, and pharmaceuticals, not to mention other medical devices.

For such a beast of a conglomerate, ABT has managed to propel its growth in the next years to significant heights. With high double-digit growth in neuromodulation, nutrition, and diagnostics, the company manages a 5-year revenue CAGR of 17.61% and an EPS CAGR of 25.26%.

*Hold on a second, those are roughly the same numbers we saw earlier!*

&#x200B;

[And Yet, a lower EPS brings a higher appreciation potential](https://preview.redd.it/lf2uaip7zlv61.png?width=971&format=png&auto=webp&s=58a5a5a54b3af5d4f20c12cc94825bc9591feff8)

There's something wrong here, right?

The same industry, roughly the same growth & eps improvements, and with EW focusing on a niche. Yet wholly different EPS multiples. Either ABT is highly undervalued, or EW is highly overvalued.

**BUY ABT over EW**"

This puts a lot of pressure on the MM’s to open up more strike prices right? If $40+ strike prices open up, my opinion is that that the majority of people are going to roll their options right into these new ones. 

With three weeks until expiration, I see this being fantastic for all of us MVIS apes. Good luck to everyone and thanks for coming to my Tard Talk!

2021-04-26 20:32:20,wallstreetbets,Honestly just take out a mortgage on your mothers home and buy.
2021-04-26 20:20:33,wallstreetbets,A buddy of mine told me to throw a good chunk at it and 2 mins later I acquired 1000 shares. Stupid? Maybe. But I ain't selling until I see stupid gains.
2021-04-26 21:31:31,wallstreetbets,Holding 1 5/21 21c and 7 5/21 30c up 700% debating on buying 35c tomorrow
2021-04-27 00:26:07,wallstreetbets,"I can't make up any mind. Seems like MVIS might be going to the moon but might be a set up after GME fucked MMs. I'm still going in but not as far as I really want too. I just buy stock. Too many crayons for options. But hearing is too late is crap. Investing is making money, lots are thinking 100k+ shit, I'm cool with 10- 20k. Money is money."
2021-04-26 21:17:14,wallstreetbets,Doubling up on shares tomorrow; F it. Ready to screw the shorts & see 100+
2021-04-26 23:11:42,wallstreetbets,Test
2021-04-26 21:02:15,wallstreetbets,"Gamma squeeze in Uranus, I'm there"
2021-04-26 22:45:15,wallstreetbets,I missed out big time apes.  Sold my $11 calls for $2.10 last week. Now I have $25 and $35. Paper handed dummy I am
2021-04-26 22:25:59,wallstreetbets,I'll drop a couple grand on calls in the morning.
2021-04-26 22:02:54,wallstreetbets,"14,000 shares let’s go I want see 140"
2021-04-26 21:49:06,wallstreetbets,Not everything is a squeeze...just buy more
2021-04-26 20:26:51,wallstreetbets,The 3 weeks until expo isn’t technically a good thing for a squeeze. Earnings are also in this week and I’m not quite sure they’re going to be good at all. I also don’t know their formula to start covering so this is all hypothetical. I’d feel a lot better if these contracts expired Friday and they’re continuously underwater so we can assume they’re buying the shares a bit quicker.
2021-04-26 20:46:27,wallstreetbets,I wonder what price the MM will make the options and when will they be released.. maybe in the morning
2021-04-26 22:41:40,wallstreetbets,Joined the action early this morning. Expecting a run up through the day and possibly week 📈📈
2021-04-27 07:44:21,wallstreetbets,Yesterday (26th) over 10 Million in MVIS calls was purchased.  You never see that large an order for the big boys like SPY or the Q's.  Today (27th) is going to be nuts
2021-04-27 00:12:03,wallstreetbets,I feel like I already missed the train so I'm probably gonna hold out on this one
2021-04-27 00:00:52,wallstreetbets,"It was joked about, but why does it feel like this particular slice of reddit is -actually- becoming a rival hedgefund, right alongside the others?

I feel like I'm here at the beginning. Give it three to four years. Hell, two.

Fucking incredible. Just me?

Edit:

Forgive me, internet. I got excited and took to the keyboard to manifest in words a feeling that had been stirred up by recent events.

I have been gently scolded and promptly set back on course by fellow internetter u/bryan7474, whose wise council and okay, I'm done, it was fun for a second but the feeling and impetus has worn off.

Later gator.

Genuinely best wishes, by the way, fellow Canadian?"
2021-04-27 01:23:05,wallstreetbets,I have 1 5/21 17Call from Friday 🙂
2021-04-27 02:15:24,wallstreetbets,They will add more strikes

2021-04-27 04:29:54,wallstreetbets,Feeling stupid 🙈 sold 500 shares yesterday at 19euros and today bought back 200 at 25😂.  Love mvis so bought More! Only got 1000 shares now but up 100%. Looking for a big run this week! MVIS to the moon
2021-04-27 05:05:52,wallstreetbets,"The Volume Yesterday was incredible. Hype and the news that MVIS was the most talked about ticker on WSBs is fueling it, at least the retail side of things. 
Im not sure if we will hit 40. I was gonna sell at 25 but we zoomed straight past that and now I dont really have an exit strat. 

Whats yours?

(Miss me with that Diamond Hand BS, I actually want to make some money this time. GME was fun, but not really profitable for me.)"
2021-04-27 07:05:30,wallstreetbets,Go for the squeeze.. It's not begin yet.🚀🚀🌕🚀🚀
2021-04-27 06:59:30,wallstreetbets,Im in
2021-04-27 08:52:06,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-26 23:42:06,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-26 20:41:35,wallstreetbets,Bro I’m so fed up with robinhood. I put in a fucking option call for $35 for July. They cancelled my order rip funds
2021-04-26 22:58:17,wallstreetbets,This has potential to b a bigger squeeze then gme. It’s been way more efficient then GME ever want.
2021-04-26 20:07:43,wallstreetbets,This is retarded
2021-04-27 15:44:57,wallstreetbets,Rip 🪦
2021-04-27 03:45:50,wallstreetbets,It hasn’t even had an alpha squeeze retard
2021-04-26 21:03:18,wallstreetbets,Then where will I sleep?
2021-04-26 20:24:02,wallstreetbets,Fortune favors the bold
2021-04-26 22:47:36,wallstreetbets,Whats the floor for the squeeze?
2021-04-26 21:23:28,wallstreetbets,Shorts and hedge fck s are 💩ing in their pants.
2021-04-27 00:16:08,wallstreetbets,How do you make a blank comment like this?
2021-04-26 21:05:49,wallstreetbets,This thing squeezes to $110 and I’ll let you
2021-04-27 01:47:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah but people would’ve laughed at you for not taking profit if you had lost at the end. Whatever. Enjoy the gains
2021-04-27 00:14:35,wallstreetbets,I'm kicking myself for being paper handed too! Didn't have a lot -- 100 shares at $12 average cost. I sold at \~$17 per share last Friday before market close. Felt pretty good this weekend. Kick in the gut when I checked the price today. LOL! Lesson learned (maybe).
2021-04-27 01:49:39,wallstreetbets,You have no idea
2021-04-27 05:24:29,wallstreetbets,By the time it opens that’ll be like 2 calls :(
2021-04-27 00:36:18,wallstreetbets,same. knowing my luck it’s gonna crash immediately. so might just buy one put just in case
2021-04-26 21:26:35,wallstreetbets,"ER isn’t what people are chasing, they’re chasing a buyout announcement. MVIS pushed their earnings from May to this Thursday last week. This Thursday is also a press conference they announced a few months back. A lot of people are speculating a buyout announcement"
2021-04-26 23:29:15,wallstreetbets,"MM uses delta as a % of to hedge the number of shares they need to buy, in case of exercised. So a delta of .50 they buy 50 shares for one contract to hedge. That’s the way it’s been explained to me"
2021-04-26 21:16:53,wallstreetbets,Options are too spaced out for gamma squeeze I think. GME and others had weeklys
2021-04-26 23:25:28,wallstreetbets,I’ll be buying calls.
2021-04-26 21:51:46,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I see them loading now."
2021-04-27 07:55:53,wallstreetbets,Can you post a link showing that 10million calls were purchased yesterday?
2021-04-27 00:25:12,wallstreetbets,"I think that if we break $35 tomorrow/in the near 2 days, there is a ton of upside. I’m 100% a noob, but that’s what I keep hearing. I’d get in while you can my guy."
2021-04-27 02:41:30,wallstreetbets,I advised people to buy at 22 at open and now they’re up 30%+. IMHO I would still advise buying at 30 as the upside for this is monstrous.
2021-04-27 01:08:54,wallstreetbets,"A hedgefund run by a group of people who are mostly unknown to each other who are mostly broke and only follow the rules of a bunch of subreddit volunteers with (likely) no financial expertise who don't necessarily benefit?

Naw. This is a circus. And the clowns are playing their part.

But I like the circus. Clowns are awesome. DFV started something adorable."
2021-04-27 07:56:52,wallstreetbets,My strat is to get out before these yolos do. I will make that call based on today’s chart
2021-04-27 00:12:37,wallstreetbets,Wrong place to learn how to options trade bud.
2021-04-26 20:45:10,wallstreetbets,prolly cuz its market is closed?

2021-04-27 02:29:54,wallstreetbets,"dont, dont get in when there are hedglings and others are on play. Wait for it to consolidate at a price range for couple days atleast and then jump in. Atleast thats what i have learned so far."
2021-04-26 21:39:15,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Companies dont WILLINGLY announce earnings EARLY if it’s not something good...
2021-04-26 22:33:55,wallstreetbets,This is false. It was not moved to an earlier date. It was just finally anouned what date it would be. Most brokers had a guess of a may date prior.
2021-04-27 05:15:58,wallstreetbets,"i've been in MVIS for a year now and read the sub religiously and i've never heard about a scheduled press conference announced months ago.  care to elaborate?

or are you getting the anticipated lidar update mixed up as something else?"

Thank you for that."
2021-04-27 02:43:16,wallstreetbets,"Clowns or not, we made hedge funds lose over 50% of their portfolios on GME alone."

2021-04-27 00:41:08,wallstreetbets,All you’ll get from here is 0 dte SPY calls or puts and it doesn’t matter... you will guess wrong and you’ll see gain porn from the person that guessed right.
2021-04-26 20:46:13,wallstreetbets,Even still it should’ve been placed at opening

2021-04-26 21:27:57,wallstreetbets,I have shares but when I get paid Thursday if it dips prior to earnings I may buy some calls too.
2021-04-26 23:19:57,wallstreetbets,Ew! I thought he meant he owns planet!
2021-04-26 21:58:31,wallstreetbets,wasnt gme earnings moved earlier?
2021-04-26 22:27:39,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, not sure how they’re earnings are going to be good at all. Whatever the announcement is could mitigate it, but their financials have been horse shit. I’m inclined to buy the rumor on this one. It’s nowhere near the retard strength or share illiquidity that gme has been."
2021-04-26 22:44:26,wallstreetbets,People are just running loose with this one...
2021-04-27 02:45:36,wallstreetbets,"To be fair to my point though and yes I am indeed still thinking about this, there -are- relationships being formed here that could become something, with time.

Something reasonable and rooted in undeniable reality. Something even you wouldn't scoff at or look down on, laughing with your friends and all those who 'know the joke' being played.

I dunno anymore I just like to type and my brain (which is me) won't shut up.

2021-04-27 12:41:29,wallstreetbets,Yep i dont give two fucks bout the squeeze lol...im in it for the future tech. Squeeze is just the cherry on top 🥰
2021-04-26 20:58:29,wallstreetbets,"Before you submit order , look for ‘TIF’ or ‘Time In Force’ option > select GTC or Good till Cancelled.

Wouldn’t suggest doing this for options though."
2021-04-26 20:58:37,wallstreetbets,"There's an option either the order is just for the day or good till cancelled 

Also, did you set the buy price a good amount higher than it was listed premarket? Considering it had gapped premarket there's no way in hell the option would have been executed"
2021-04-26 21:00:57,wallstreetbets,I see where I fucked myself. It’s set to good for a day. Sad news. Thanks for informing me. Also I had did my DD the night before the market opened and got screwed. My loss
2021-04-26 21:08:13,wallstreetbets,The premium on the option would have dramatically changed  by open anyways. The price was soaring in pre market.
2021-04-26 21:09:25,wallstreetbets,Bro. I paid $255 for the call. It got cancelled. I went to see how much it changed. It was at $660 reason why I’m not in this play now

At the rate of 450 shares/mo that will take 83,000 months, or roughly 7,000 years. I think you might get bored of this project by then."

2021-04-27 00:10:54,wallstreetbets,"This is not a ""YOLO Update"" like everyone's yolo updates now flooding the sub. It just just marked with the YOLO flair because the other flairs don't seem to fit? Also, from the rules for ""yolo"" posts, it fits the minimum capital requirements.

There is not a point at which I intend to close. Ever. So it would be impossible for me to do a gain/loss porn post.

These updates are sort of a continuation of the mathematical DD about the system itself.

When I posted my thesis on how GameStop stock was either going to reflect the true value of the company - which I personally believe is much higher than what we are seeing right now, or (through a mathematical anomaly in options trading on artificially price-suppressed stocks) a retail investor could technically own the entire company in a matter of years simply starting with 1000 shares.

It got a bit more complicated than originally expected, due to the bizarre price movements, but it is worth showcasing that this is working or not working.

Others seem to be enjoying this journey; and it's not just here to show off gains or losses. I am explicitly tracking the growth in share count.

Would it be better to mark these as DD moving forward?"
2021-04-27 04:32:53,wallstreetbets,"This guy is grandfathered in though.

You let DFV post updates without him even buying more shares, while this guy adds enough for it to be a brand new YOLO each time?

Put in my 2021 contribution limit, dumped it all in on GME at $40/share and boy am I glad I averaged down!

Not financial advice, of course. Just stoked to talk to another person who understands that feeling having actively bought shares above $300 before the Great Shenanigans."

2021-04-27 11:19:37,wallstreetbets,"DFV had a different thesis than I do. It happens to be the same stock, but we are playing it extremely differently.

Sorry if it is confusing for you that the best stock for my strategy (and the single safest place in the world for my money, in my personal opinion) happens to also be the one which was initially clocked at 140% short interest.

I have immense respect for DFV, and you are right: based on his thesis and his strategy, his hands are tied (until at least another wildly unreasonable price drop). It just wouldn't make sense for him to continue expanding his position for the time being.

But my strategy is just getting started. 😁"

2021-04-26 23:13:32,wallstreetbets,"183 months. Just over 15 years.

Approximately two thirds of that growth will occur in the final year, requiring an average of 2MM shares per month. If we assume the price remains fixed at $200 for the next 14 years (which I somehow suspect you don't believe will happen), acquiring over 24MM shares will require an annual income of (at minimum) $4.75B after taxes.

And before you remind me that you're selling calls to make up the difference, there aren't enough GME calls in the world to give you the money you need in that time frame. Honestly, living to 7,000 is more believable than what would be necessary to pull off exponential growth. 

I've been there, I've had those thoughts, they're not valid. If you're really pouring your money into this thinking it's going to work... the right thing to say is stop because you're going to get burned, but meh, maybe once you realized this is a dumb idea you'll get out OK. Maybe you won't, this is WSB so go for it, I guess."

2021-04-27 19:47:46,wallstreetbets,">Second round was calculated at an averaged % increase across 2 months and calculated monthly, rather than weekly.

That's where you're wrong. It's ~160 consecutive *periods* in which you increase by 10%. That can be weeks. Let's go with that. 

So two thirds of the shares need to be purchased in the last *12 weeks*. In a three month span you'll need to purchase ~24MM shares, at a cost of ~$4.75B. Now instead of needing to make *that* in a year you need to be pulling down 19B before taxes. 

At that rate you won't even need some hair brained scheme involving exponentially increasing your exposure via selling calls (of which you've provided no proof, btw), you could purchase the entire company outright in six months. But, of course, you can't, because there is not a person who has ever lived with an annuallized cash income of nearly $20B."

Now think about what he just said. In a Failure to Deliver scenario the problem comes from the fact that you have ""borrowed"" a share that doesn't exist, and so you can't give it to the person who bought it. The solution to that problem is to buy shares and deliver them. 

So you buy the 40c on a stock trading at 150. You pay 110/share for the contract then immediately exercise and pay an additional 40/share to buy them. That's just market price. You could have bought the shares on the open market. 

And then what do you do with them? Well apparently you sell them to your buddy via a dark pool at a discount. But why? Why do you do that? You *could* deliver them to the buyer, and all you've done is sell shares via a very convoluted method. Selling them to your buddy doesn't make sense, you're eating a loss doing that. Selling on the open market effectively disconnects the whole call thing from the short selling thing. They supposedly do this because it's impossible to get their hands on shares to sell, but clearly in the middle of the thing *they've got shares in their hands*.

These people are completely delusional. 

And to answer your question more directly, a deep ITM call is one where the ""strike price"" of the option (the price the seller of the option agrees to sell shares to you at) is substantially less than the market price. In the above example the strike is $40, so if you're holding that option you can guaranteed by 100 shares at $40/each from whoever sold the option to you. If you bought the shares when the price was around $40 or less and it went up to $150 you'll be over the moon because you can sell the option (or exercise and sell the shares) for a $110/share profit. Buy when the hedgie comes to buy your 40c, you're not going to give it to him for *less* than 150/share - you're going to get *at least* that much for it (and probably more, to account for the fact that the price might go up between now and expiry). They might as well just buy on the open market if the goal is to acquire shares."

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why Tilray is Positioned for Success in the Cannabis Industry - DD At this point in time, the cannabis industry is still in its infancy. There are over [60 large cannabis companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cannabis_companies) competing for the largest market share, and the race to have the greatest presence is only beginning.

Tilray, which currently ranks 3rd in the [list of the largest cannabis companies in the world](https://www.zippia.com/advice/largest-cannabis-companies/), already has an incredible amount of leverage over the majority of its rivals. After the mega-merger with rival company Aphria, Tilray will overtake both Curaleaf and Canopy Growth in terms of revenue, making it [the largest cannabis company in the world](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tilray-largest-cannabis-company-once-194301361.html).

In an industry that has not even begun to reach its formal formation, infrastructure and revenue are by far the most important traits a company can have. Tilray, which will own dozens of diverse subsidiaries after its Aphria merger, has a global presence in over 18 countries:

&#x200B;

[Tilray Supply Locations](https://preview.redd.it/81mgzs2vtlv61.png?width=2116&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5417b6c1a43f27c31944be20ca94c7824f0c616)

Although a portion of these countries only allow hemp-related products and/or clinical trial exports, the infrastructure is still there. Tilray has a massive global presence, giving it a launchpad to build its brand name and form agreements across the world. Although companies like Curaleaf, Trulieve and Cronos Group already have market share in the U.S, Tilray's strategy of aggressively expanding its operations on a global scale will prove to be the most successful method in dominating the industry. It allows for long-term growth, that can adapt to the endless demand for cannabis in the future of our society.

And that's not to say Tilray doesn't already have infrastructure in the United States. Currently, Tilray owns the goliath hemp-food company [Manitoba Harvest](https://manitobaharvest.com/), the world's **largest** hemp food manufacturer which has products in over 16,000 retail stores globally. In addition, Tilray will own [SweetWater Brewing Company](https://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/), a popular brewing company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, after the Aphria merger this quarter. Not only do both companies offer a steady stream of revenue, but they provide an opportunity for U.S exposure once federal legalization occurs. In addition, Tilray's diverse brand segmentation will allow them to generate revenue from a broad range of sources.

In the coming years, attitudes towards marijuana will drastically change. It's been almost a decade since Colorado and Washington [legalized cannabis in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_history_of_cannabis_in_the_United_States#Legalization_timeline), and since then 16 states have followed. If expectations are met, the federal prohibition on marijuana could end as early as [this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/cannabis-reform-senators-say-they-will-push-pot-bill-in-2021.html). With government support and an overwhelming increase in positive views towards legalization, it's only a matter of time until cannabis will become a destigmatized substance integrated into adult society.

&#x200B;

[U.S public opinion on legalizing marijuana](https://preview.redd.it/xbuq8p5stlv61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bcb525b8ff6b718dba51485f83b79d74870c8ca)

The legal marijuana industry is only beginning. Worldwide legalization and embracement will take years or decades to reach, but when it does, cannabis will be a universally accepted substance with an endless demand. After the Tilray/Aphria merger this quarter, it will become clear which company has the greatest chance of capitalizing off this rapidly expanding industry.

2021-04-27 09:18:41,wallstreetbets,"The bid/ask liquidity on the calls are now terrible so ITM. Exercise and net more gains immediately, like $100-300 per contract."
2021-04-27 09:22:17,wallstreetbets,Imagine an investing sub discouraging people from Due Diligence? That's a pretty shitty rule.

2021-04-27 00:09:43,wallstreetbets,Why do you think that? Moob investor here
2021-04-27 00:05:15,wallstreetbets,For those of us who don't have a lot of extra that we can afford to lose and have it on other stocks (AMC GME) would you recommend waiting till it drops to buy (buying the dip) or do you think this stock only goes up?
2021-04-27 00:27:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah I had to cancel a limit order for $22 today
2021-04-26 22:58:57,wallstreetbets,Isn’t that the definition of investing?

2021-04-27 01:41:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, tried a few times to share DD, stupid bots.  
We look for advanced tech companies then do DD beyond just fundamentals. 
We look at Media, markets, websites, basic Google, LinkedIn on management, customers and/or prospects, patents, speed of growth potential, laymen’s understanding of what they do, competition, timelines, comparable pricing, verticals, past growth, history on offerings, VC/investors strategy, institutional % /who and of course outstanding shares, float, insider activity, shorts, charts, typical market analysis...

Battery tech is improving, but where is the next leap for batteries?  I found QS that is working on solid state batteries.
Plant based foods are growing in popularity but still don’t taste or look like the real thing.  Who can provide that solution?  I found “Notco” who is still private that uses molecular tech to solve that problem.
Or in MVIS case, to do any kind of self driving vehicles the sensors needed to be better or government would not allow to be licensed and on the roads.  Dramatically better Lidar would be a requirement."

In the event of a buyout the retail investors win or lose money? If the company is bought by Microsoft for instance do you get a microsoft share per X ammount of MVIS shares?"

2021-04-26 22:11:42,wallstreetbets,You’re not considering the Premium for the contract. The premium that can be bought and sold is a price that moves exponentially with the linear price of the stock. The risk is greater because they expire. You must factor the time decay vs the gains. Do some more learning on YouTube before you start trading options. They can be devastating.
2021-04-26 22:41:12,wallstreetbets,Can I get a turkey sub?
2021-04-26 20:01:18,wallstreetbets,thanks!!
2021-04-27 10:25:09,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I get it. But I would just really have a hard time trusting RH to do the right thing considering what that have shown they will do in the past. Especially with margin."
2021-04-26 22:16:58,wallstreetbets,"oh for sure, i’m in no position to start yet, just trying to learn and understand."
2021-04-26 21:18:44,wallstreetbets,"Bro just go on YouTube and search inthemoney, good breakdown on options"
2021-04-27 11:41:51,wallstreetbets,"RH has changed my life. My entire trading strategy is based on maxing out my margin all the time. The 2.5% rate makes up for any hiccups they may have for being a new broker. I think RH is the Apple of investing platforms, they may not be the best but they will win popularity contest by having the best Margin rate and UI. I don’t trust any broker at all. I opened up 9 other accounts after the GME debacle, haven’t found another I like. Fidelity and TD being the worst."

Too many call options to list that I've sold, but it's a lot. I bought 9 MVIS $13 strike 5/21 and after it ran up 100% I did a vertical spread selling MVIS $35 strike 5/21 to lock in some gains at least since the premium is just insanely good right now. I'm pretty sure with a almost .50 delta that it will most certainly hit, but my greed and my need to hedge. Also, as a random question, I've only been trading for a few months so I'm new to stocks and idk if I pay taxes quarterly on my realized gains or if I pay at the end of the year when I get my 1099? I'm pretty sure I would pay quarterly, but some verification would be nice.

Also, paper trading on a platform like Webull or Thinkorswim will let you play with fake money on the real market, so you’d get to see how much of your own money you’d have lost if you just believed you had it all figured out."

Calculating option P&L requires some pretty high level math, so try to stay with me.

It started at 100, so 200-100 is 100. Option p&l done."

If he sold another after he would have -1 and you would be right, he would need to hold 100 shares - unless he was approved for naked options, in which case he would be taking on infinite risk. Theres no limit to high the stock can go, and if it went to $10k per share he would be on the hook for $1m (He actually has 10 contracts, I just changed it to 1 to make it simpler)

Make sense?"

The contracts at the time of the screenshot were valued at $12.20, ×100 shares per contract, ×10 contracts. $12.20×100×10=$12,200. 

So at the moment of the screenshot, he spent $1590 and could have sold for $12,200 total, profit of $10,610."
2021-04-26 21:16:54,wallstreetbets,So what's you're question? How not to make brain not don't work?
2021-04-26 20:29:32,wallstreetbets,Start with sold puts in place of limit buys. Covered calls instead of limit sells. Limits risk and you get to collect some premium if you gauge it right.
2021-04-26 22:18:59,wallstreetbets,If you have a tda account go to learning center. Their options course claims 7 hrs. Definitely much shorter usually. But it's a good start and free (you don't have to fund account I don't believe)
2021-04-26 21:18:07,wallstreetbets,The fuck you say?
2021-04-26 21:56:07,wallstreetbets,"No, it makes you own the stock to sell covered calls."

2021-04-26 21:17:43,wallstreetbets,Mind explain how that works. I see that goes for 430 or So. But when I look at call options I don't understand as it also shows prices below the current market price. Isn't a call a bet that price goes up? How do u buy a 60 for a 430 stock. So lost.
2021-04-26 23:16:39,wallstreetbets,That's a given. How else would they be covered
2021-04-26 20:15:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah we all like to think that but i guarantee your mindset will change once you start having calls expire worthless lol
2021-04-26 21:15:39,wallstreetbets,You understand the risk involved but not how they work
2021-04-26 22:51:35,wallstreetbets,Lol I remember when I first said that...
2021-04-26 20:42:07,wallstreetbets,How very un-ape like.  Your brain must have ripples
2021-04-26 23:24:47,wallstreetbets,>do you \_really\_ understand the risk involved?
2021-04-27 05:58:40,wallstreetbets,You just posted a comment to start this chain that’s the exact opposite of how a call works and you think you “understand the risks involved”?
2021-04-26 22:18:44,wallstreetbets,"No worries. And that's all without ever exercising the option and collecting the shares. 

You would exercise these if you were long bullish like DFV did with his GME contracts. Instead of selling them, he exercised his right to buy the shares at the strike price because he felt that in time the share price would continue to rise."
2021-04-26 23:32:29,wallstreetbets,It's all risk right? Even buying a share. That's hard to answer and depends on your personal risk tolerance. Know the greeks. Compare them with other strikes and the premiums. Look at technical analysis. Know the companies fundamentals. Play an event like earnings or a demo day. Or just buy leaps with calls close to the money.. pretty safe.. on a company you believe in and know there is more upside
2021-04-26 21:49:14,wallstreetbets,"My bad okay so no forget what I told you. I forget I know more than I do. Go the spy $422c ON 4/30 thats the $60 I'm talking abt. All the pricing is x100! Think of it as a game and its a super mulitiplier!! So if it says .6 to buy that contract will cost $60. Theres way more to it than that but this is the basic concept.

This is called buying a call, sometimes you they say long call. Idk. Next thing we do is we wait for a market dip minimum of -0.25% in abt 5mins. Quicker the better for dailies. Gotta buy quick tho but capable of a+200% increase if you pick the right way and TIME. Always sell your buyin if you hit. 

Use optionscalculator.Com and plugs in you're values. See possible returns and losses. And how quick lol. Its about super leverage and you have no calateral like shares. Just the option. 

Also this is just one way to do it! There are plenty of others. This i would definitely rate this as a way crazy play if you don't know what the hell im talking abt at all. This is max degenerate ‐60% or +500% level retard

Edit only do this with SPY. Sorry."
2021-04-26 23:44:40,wallstreetbets,"The post I responded to said, ""Robin hood makes you own the shares to buy calls.""

I was correcting that person."
2021-04-26 20:18:27,wallstreetbets,"About the same feeling I get betting a hundred on a pair of aces only to have the flop, turn and river cards be worthless to me and get beat by 3 5's."
2021-04-26 22:19:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm just starting to learn about this. This means you've lost out on the premium you paid for the contract, right?"
2021-04-27 00:19:03,wallstreetbets,"Every call I buy haha!

This one, the one that would have went ITM, I was lazy and kept forgetting to buy and then when I did I'd forget to verify if my order executed.

Just the way she goes, the way of the road."
2021-04-27 04:50:32,wallstreetbets,"I understand more than I did before, gotta get practical knowledge at some point"
2021-04-26 22:56:14,wallstreetbets,"Same lmao, anyway $TIRX Yolo tomorrow. They just released the earnings."
2021-04-27 04:57:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah you lose what you paid for the contracts. I'm not stupid enough to yolo 100 contracts my first buy in.
2021-04-26 22:24:26,wallstreetbets,So his call is for May 21. Lets say its past the expiration but hes in the money. When does he have to exercise them by?
2021-04-26 22:02:00,wallstreetbets,So in this example. Wait for a dip on spy. Open the contract. Wait for it to raise above my buy in price. And sell before it hits the high end of the contract? Am I readin ya right?
2021-04-26 22:40:05,wallstreetbets,Correct
2021-04-26 23:10:12,wallstreetbets,There is no going past the expiration date. It's the expiration date. Exercising would need to be done by the end of that day.
2021-04-26 23:27:32,wallstreetbets,Do you have to sell before the expiry as well?
2021-04-26 23:41:54,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Tesla announces record profits and revenue in the first quarter and surprises Wall Street Analysts 
2021-04-27 01:44:34,wallstreetbets,"I'm sad they just disclosed their ""insert forbidden currency here"" as the initial 1,5 billion. But atleast people actually bought cars for 272'000$ worth of that currency lol."
2021-04-26 22:58:28,wallstreetbets,So did TIRX
2021-04-26 22:32:19,wallstreetbets,"(non-GAAP) 

For those who don't know, when you see non-GAAP it is like hearing ""subprime""...it means ""shit"" and it's probably made up. 

I hate that Tesla is still allowed to report non-GAAP earnings. 

If someone at FINRA or SEC reads this: do your fucking job! This company is doing earnings management or something more nefarious."
2021-04-26 23:25:43,wallstreetbets,"Tesla have increased revenue from car sales 6.8% since 2019. That figure excludes regulatory credits.

With price drops around the world towards the end of Q1, I imagine it is going to look even more dire in Q2.

RIP"
2021-04-26 23:59:42,wallstreetbets,"after this solid an earnings release, the down pressure is definitely not a function of retail investors...so who exactly is shorting?"
2021-04-27 00:16:28,wallstreetbets,The pen 🖊 in mightier than the sword 🗡
2021-04-27 07:50:14,wallstreetbets,"I find crazy people saying that without regulatory credits or any other source of income they would not profitable. No shit

You know what they would do without that? Change the plan and still be profitable, builds the factories a little slower, put a little less money in R&D, etc

Since they have those streams, they are simply taking advantage of it and putting as much money the can back in the business and growing it to the moon as fast as possible"
2021-04-27 00:07:45,wallstreetbets,I am surprised that Wall Street Anal-yeast surprised
2021-04-27 06:10:30,wallstreetbets,I'd assumed all or almost all of TSLA's fake internet money was purchased by them prior to the announcement.
2021-04-27 03:36:53,wallstreetbets,"TIRX is a tragedy, I can imagine the feeling of those who purchased at 90$ to wake up next morning on 12$ news"
2021-04-26 20:36:07,wallstreetbets,"Nah, down 20 and trade sideways. Maybe tank another 20 on Wednesday because of Jpow"
2021-04-27 00:29:27,wallstreetbets,that would be great for me as I can buy more with my monthly paycheck
2021-04-27 00:51:24,wallstreetbets,They lost GAAP right next to non-GAAP..?
2021-04-27 08:02:34,wallstreetbets,What’s FINR or the SEC going to do? It’s not illegal to report non-gaap earnings
2021-04-27 01:25:28,wallstreetbets,Aren't all companies allowed to report non-GAAP?
2021-04-26 20:37:11,wallstreetbets,"Lmao your weekly is fucked, Jpow speaking on Wednesday. GG"
2021-04-26 21:27:08,wallstreetbets,BAD BAD bet
2021-04-26 20:25:03,wallstreetbets,Short it then pussy.
2021-04-27 06:29:43,wallstreetbets,"Agree, but I thought they at least did something with it that would make headlines. Well anyway, rip my calls."
2021-04-27 08:19:08,wallstreetbets,"A company like TSLA should not be allowed to report non GAAP earnings. It should not be allowed to still classify itself as an ""emerging growth company"" which is the only reason they are allowed to do it actually. 

And you're wrong as well. public companies must use GAAP. it's only companies that use that designation ""emerging growth company"" to circumvent the law."
2021-04-27 07:45:40,wallstreetbets,"no, not at all. otherwise what's the point of having it?"
2021-04-26 23:41:53,wallstreetbets,Not sleeping well tonight because of your comment. I pray you are wrong come the morning.
2021-04-26 20:09:23,wallstreetbets,!RemindMe Tesla’s gonna “die” in five years
2021-04-26 22:51:37,wallstreetbets,You’re dumb
2021-04-27 08:34:03,wallstreetbets,I’ll concede on the emerging company part. I wasn’t aware of that exemption. I’m fully aware public companies are required to post GAAP earnings. I assumed they reported their pro forma earningsalong with the required GAAP earnings
2021-04-27 12:52:17,wallstreetbets,"You are gambling bro. I never want anyone to lose their money, because that's how I blow up my account several years ago, never had a good sleep (Expensive lesson). I hope you didn't put 100% of account on a single option bet that expires in less than three days. God bless."

2021-04-27 15:52:41,wallstreetbets,Me today    =====>    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQOO2xGQ1Pc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQOO2xGQ1Pc)
2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Market sentiment and Technicals are indicating that $GME and $AMC are about to experience a third Bull run. The thing about both this stocks, is that recent news have tried to discourage people from buying more calls or shares.

But while the media is trying to push both stocks down, the overall feeling around these stocks is bullish. 
Today $AMC has broked above the descending triangle formation in the daily chart (Check Finviz or whatever tool you want) and a little after $GME has experienced the same trend. Breaking above the SMA and both currently spiking in After Market.

If these levels consolidate in this week and the next, both of these stocks can experience Another Bull run to previous highs. Note: I am not telling that it will Gamma Squeeze, just saying that in the short term Bears are going to get destroyed. And the longer the people who are shorting keep their Shorts/Puts the more they are gonna get burned, because people aee not selling either of them. 
Holders have proven that the short volume is because they are not selling.

TLDR: 🚀🚀🚀for Amc and Gme for now. More volume and momentum required to moon."

2021-04-26 21:42:08,wallstreetbets,"I usually don’t comment, bc I don’t really buy in to a lot of stuff. But with amc if you simply looked to before covid and a little before where it was at. It was obvious if you played long it would bounce back there and probably better as people want to go back theaters. You didn’t have to be a financial genius  for this."

2021-04-27 12:08:21,wallstreetbets,Not that I believe it but there is a guy on youtube that says AMC can hit 100k per stock. Think he says it is going to happen on the 29th.

2021-04-26 21:14:38,wallstreetbets,Just sold my gme and went all in on amc.
2021-04-26 22:06:35,wallstreetbets,Well gme went up over $17 amc had 90 million in volume and went up a whole 1 dollars bahahahha so yeah someone’s gonna expect a bill run bahahha can’t stop won’t stop game stop
2021-04-26 23:09:34,wallstreetbets,AMC gonna dilute like hell though.
2021-04-26 21:57:29,wallstreetbets,I might be a little tarded wht does TLDR mean?
2021-04-27 01:48:15,wallstreetbets,Why AMC?
2021-04-27 04:34:12,wallstreetbets,I hope so because if AMC pops I can short it on the way down with less risk than shorting gme.
2021-04-27 09:10:15,wallstreetbets,AMC is hot garbage but have fun kids
2021-04-26 22:51:55,wallstreetbets,"why the hell would amc go up with gme? the only thing amc has tried to do is fuck it's shareholders repeatedly in the ass. The CEOs don't deserve any of their payouts. They deserve to be shorted. 

If only people would stop being greedy, know that amc is a lost cause when their executives are greedy fuckers, and pile into GME, then they may actually realise what a great investment it is, in addition to the potential acutally possible, realistic short squeeze. Fucking hell."
2021-04-26 21:21:06,wallstreetbets,I just think AMC is gonna drop like a rock when the company votes for more shares in a week or two.
2021-04-26 23:32:06,wallstreetbets,Fuck AMC man. The minute their CEO gave himself a fat bonus it was over. GME on the other hand is the real deal.

2021-04-27 10:47:19,wallstreetbets,A month ago i was getting lots of dds and post on gme and amc. Lately i feel that most of the stuff related to amc and gme are gone in Reddit. I dont know why this is happening? Is Reddit blocking it? Not that i care as i would still hold to the moon
2021-04-27 10:57:28,wallstreetbets,"yeah.,..sure looks like it 198 -180"

2021-04-27 10:36:49,wallstreetbets,um.. in order for the price to go up it requires sellers... if everyone just holds hands and sings kum-ba-ya the price doesn't go anywhere

2021-04-26 21:21:37,wallstreetbets,No theyre just like im sorry u bought so late but i think youve convinced yourselves its just gonna short squeeze every few months

2021-04-27 05:34:07,wallstreetbets,"Ahh yes another smooth brained ape. Let me give you some wrinkles. 

GME and amc are highly volatile and calls are already hedged by option sellers so it wouldn't matter. 
Also AMC is and was always a distraction from GME."

I've just been throwing a little each week towards AMC since the end of Feb. 53 shares now.   
It's not a lot compared to a lot of people here, but if it moons it'd be life changing for me."

2021-04-26 20:42:33,wallstreetbets,"Is AMC really the answer? At least GME has the promise of a reinvention. AMC is just the same old company that was dying before the pandemic, except now they have whatever impacts from being closed for a year.

AMC feels like just as much (if not more) of a gamble on a squeeze as GME. There's no fundamental reason for it to be worth 7x what it was pre-pandemic."
2021-04-26 20:27:45,wallstreetbets,Well sell your amc and buy at least 1 gme
2021-04-27 07:04:32,wallstreetbets,AMC is too undervalued
2021-04-26 22:21:21,wallstreetbets,"personally, I think GME has a higher chance of working. AMC already had diluted shares (started at 100 million and diluted to 450 million). I don't see AMC going up anytime soon. When it does go up, it's  usually only because the algos tied it to GME"

2021-04-26 23:40:12,wallstreetbets,AMC did nothing to improve their biz just pay their executives handsomely. GME is an actual turnaround story on top of a massive squeeze
2021-04-26 20:51:57,wallstreetbets,Im holding for a year either it gets reinvented and goes up or this squeeze happens or it tanks and never regains either way i am still curious about the possibility of a squeeze so i refuse to sell cause the way my luck works ill just sell then it will squeeze and ill hate my life more than i do now lol.
2021-04-27 00:26:49,wallstreetbets,"Naw dawg, you're not accounting for share dilution. If you take that into account, AMC's share price is well over double (maybe even triple?) the value of what it was immediately pre-pandemic. I'm too lazy to do the math, but the share price is wayyyyy out of whack right now, presumably thanks to WSB."

2021-04-27 00:42:11,wallstreetbets,I mean not really despite the memes. GME has done very little to justify it's market price and even less for any sound belief in growth outside of memes. If anything GME is reacting to the squeeze and trying to play catch up at this point.
2021-04-26 20:53:18,wallstreetbets,And that’s what it’s all about. Hating your life less than before. I think ghandi said that shit
2021-04-26 21:38:23,wallstreetbets,All of my other smart ideas are down 40%. So if this goes tits up it will be just like all my stocks.
2021-04-27 08:14:23,wallstreetbets,Id be happy to break even
2021-04-27 03:45:46,wallstreetbets,It's just astrology for retards. And astrology is already retarded. Some dipshit posts a graph every single day predicting THIS WEEK it will go. I'm holding but it is PURELY a bet that other people are retarded enough to make this shit stock go up. I'm down for a gamble. But this shit is as retarded as charting your farts to predict the next slot machine jackpot.
2021-04-27 14:46:54,wallstreetbets,Why??? Because the float is sexy bahahha imagine 1 share of gme during the squeeze will be worth more then amc paper hand gorillas will ever be. Cheap is cheap. Dilution of more then the float of 500 million that’s disgusting. If amc didn’t have a cult following everything about it would be chapter 11. You obviously don’t know math and how important float and dilution is. Hahaha facts
2021-04-27 04:46:49,wallstreetbets,"mine isn't either, special one. Some people need to be told this to wake them up."

Not sure if that person still plans to organize something. But I'm assuming he is.

I'm pretty sure there are others in their countries who are planning to do the same.

In the mean time you can enjoy your tendies with your family and get fulfillment out of that."

I always try to listen to the opposing view because I think it's important to not get too caught up in all of this, honestly, but they're always like ""you bought too late"" ""GME is crashing"" ""The squeeze already happened"" but the stock has been trading over $150/share for like 3 months.. It's like they think we're blind."
2021-04-27 01:45:52,wallstreetbets,On it

2021-04-27 06:51:31,wallstreetbets,"GME has those fundamentals. AMC is a stretch. AMC will have a nice post-pandemic rally, but if GME doesn’t squeeze then nothing will. 

I’d rather own half a share of GME than 10 shares of AMC."
2021-04-27 02:55:54,wallstreetbets,This just seems insanely naieve to me
2021-04-27 04:11:48,wallstreetbets,It will. See my last comment
2021-04-27 06:57:09,wallstreetbets,"Have you seen what Ryan Cohen is doing to the company? Gaming is a $120B industry and GameStop positioned to take over it. I think long term GME will be valued at $400-600 a share, ignoring the immense pressure of a squeeze coming."
2021-04-26 23:58:38,wallstreetbets,"ACTUALLY, the AMC and GME charts look almost identical. GME sees larger gains tho. But thos squigly lines, look dang familiar..."
2021-04-27 00:09:08,wallstreetbets,"GME is at a super high entry point, AMC isn't. Y'all get way to emotional over this AMC vs. GME stuff."
2021-04-27 00:33:59,wallstreetbets,The Failure to Delivers for AMC are in the 10's of millions - perhaps well over 100 million. T+60 from Jan 27 is tomorrow.  Also there has been no borrowable shares for a few days now.
2021-04-26 22:59:05,wallstreetbets,"Yep. It was always only about GME. AMC is a joke. Issuing 500 fucking million more shares? Lol. I don’t care that he says he won’t sell them 2021, they still will.

GME is truly a one ever phenomenon about to happen"
2021-04-27 04:18:28,wallstreetbets,"See my last comment. 

Also... every network exec and producer is a greedy motherfucker.

They didn't need GME to get rich because they squeeze money from content. 

I work in this industry. AMC will go off higher and faster than GME and once wsb owns a pile of their shares you can bet they will start catering content development.

Got any videogames that need to be a series? Want a series on wsb?

Buy the Stonk. Own the Network. The Content Must flow.

2021-04-27 09:07:59,wallstreetbets,"Gotta beat Steam, Epic, Origins, Microsoft, etc etc.  The list goes on.  GME will squeeze but I don't see any long term future with GME.

On the other hand AMC can reinvent itself.  Reduce seating and make the seating a bit more luxury with restaurant type food, maybe even have it as table seating instead.  Ticket prices might be a little higher but if AMC makes going to the movies an event then this stock is good for long term investment."
2021-04-27 11:13:34,wallstreetbets,Keep dreaming lol. You are going to end up getting burned bud.
2021-04-27 07:05:49,wallstreetbets,"Probably because hedge funds are using the same algorithms on them both. And for the most part buyers are a similar crowd. 

But like you say, GME is seeing larger gains, so why not focus on the one making greater gains? If all you can afford is 15 or less shares of AMC, then I get it, by all means you keep doing you. But if have 16 AMC shares right now, I’d rather sell all that and own 1 GME share. 

GME has much greater squeeze potential AND long term hold potential in value."
2021-04-27 01:16:14,wallstreetbets,You can buy fractional shares of gme on fidelity...
2021-04-27 02:13:56,wallstreetbets,"But like I said, if ppl are in it for the short squeeze, amc ain't going anywhere gme is.

Screw the high entry point if amc is only bent on fucking it's shareholders in the a$$. Literally a money pothole. I don't see how people don't see it and keep throwing money at it."
2021-04-27 07:07:04,wallstreetbets,"If you have less than 16 shares of AMC right now then I get it. If not, 1 share of GME is a better play than 16 shares AMC.

Comparable entry point cost only matters up to a certain point. After that it’s just what percentage gains you’re gonna make. 

I personally think $184 in GME is gonna make me way more than $184 in AMC. That’s all that matters."

2021-04-27 05:51:48,wallstreetbets,"High entry point? The thesis still stands: shorts have to cover. When this was getting gamma squeezed in late Jan before the halt from brokers, it reached $480~ imagine when the actual squeeze happens what it will got to. $200 might seem like a cheap point then"
2021-04-27 02:11:44,wallstreetbets,Well as of only one company between GME and AMC has sold from their reserves. Weird how people just have to be right thinking amc is some distraction or something.

2021-04-27 00:45:52,wallstreetbets,"Fam. Looks like AMZN is gunna announce a split this Thursday. [https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544](https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544)

Been in a channel for 8 months & all of Wall Street knows Bill Miller just said AMZN will double in Barron's so they're just waiting for a reason to send it. 🚀[https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311](https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311)

Technically it looks like a 5-star set up on a chart. Sitting at ATH's right now waiting for a reason to break out. A big earnings beat sends it higher or a split sends it higher. If they don't have numbers that get them there I expect them to play the Split card. If we get an earnings beat plus a split then we're talking a once in a lifetime move for a biz their size - maybe 50% gains in the 1-2 months. Last time it consolidated this long it doubled in a leg up in 2-3 months.

If there's a 6 to 1 or more split I bet we see +10% Friday even on average earnings.

I figure Bezos wants to give Jassy a win as new CEO and doesn't want the stock to languish any longer. A split is an ace in his pocket he's held onto for years. Big reason its stalled is the fact that it's 4k freaking dollars. A split means retail can jump in on shares & call options.

An earnings beat means analyst after analyst will trip over each other upgrading their PT's.

If we get either good earnings or a split I think we have 4k upside in the next month at least.

Anyhow I've spent a lot of time doing DD on this and wanted to bring it to the fam. Would suck if I got rich/poor without you.

I think calls are the move since we're either in for sideways or 🚀🌕. I'm thinking **June 4 @ 4,000 strike.**

Going to war tomorrow. Would love to have fam beside me.

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Holy Zjble **Genesis**

**Chapter 1** 

In the beginning /u/zjz created heaven, and earth. 

**2** And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of /u/zjz moved over the waters.

**3** And /u/zjz said: Be light made. And light was made. 

**4** And /u/zjz saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.

**5** And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.

**6** And /u/zjz said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.

**7** And /u/zjz made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so. 

**8** And /u/zjz called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day. 

**9** /u/zjz also said; Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done. 

**10** And /u/zjz called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And /u/zjz saw that it was good. 

**11** And he said: let the earth bring forth green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done. 

**12** And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed each one according to its kind. And /u/zjz saw that it was good. 

**13** And the evening and the morning were the third day. 

**14** And /u/zjz said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years: 

**15** To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth, and it was so done. 

**16** And /u/zjz made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and The stars. 

**17** And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth. 

**18** And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And /u/zjz saw that it was good. 

**19** And the evening and morning were the fourth day. 

**20** /u/zjz also said: let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven. 

**21** And /u/zjz created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And /u/zjz saw that it was good.

**22** And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth. 

**23** And the evening and morning were the fifth day. 

**24** And /u/zjz said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to their kinds. And it was so done. 

**25** And /u/zjz made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And /u/zjz saw that it was good.

**26** And he said: Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth. 

**27** And /u/zjz created man to his own image: to the image of /u/zjz he created him: male and female he created them. 

**28** And /u/zjz blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth. 

**29** And /u/zjz said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind, to be your meat: 

**30** And to all beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so done. 

**31** And /u/zjz saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.

**Chapter 2**

So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them. 

**2** And on the seventh day /u/zjz ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.

**3** And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which /u/zjz created and made. 

**4** These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord /u/zjz made the heaven and the earth: 

**5** And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord /u/zjz had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth. 

**6** But a spring rose out of the earth, watering all the surface of the earth. 

**7** And the Lord /u/zjz formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul. 

**8** And the Lord /u/zjz had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed. 

**9** And the Lord /u/zjz brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 

**10** And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads. 

**11** The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth. 

**12** And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone. 

**13** And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of Ethiopia. 

**14** And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 

**15** And the Lord /u/zjz took man, and put him into the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and to keep it. 

**16** And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat: 

**17** But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death. 

**18** And the Lord /u/zjz said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself. 

**19** And the Lord /u/zjz having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name. 

**20** And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself. 

**21** Then the Lord /u/zjz cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it. 

**22** And the Lord /u/zjz built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam. 

**23** And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man. 

**24** Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh. 

**25** And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed.

**Chapter 3**

Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord /u/zjz had made. And he said to the woman: Why hath /u/zjz commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise? 

**2** And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat:

**3** But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, /u/zjz hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die. 

**4** And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death. 

**5** For /u/zjz doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as /u/zjzs, knowing good and evil. 

**6** And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband, who did eat. 

**7** And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons. 

**8** And when they heard the voice of the Lord /u/zjz walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord /u/zjz, amidst the trees of paradise.

**9** And the Lord /u/zjz called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou? 

**10** And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself. 

**11** And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?

**12** And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 

**13** And the Lord /u/zjz said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat. 

**14** And the Lord /u/zjz said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. 

**15** I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall cursh thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel. 

**16** To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband’s power, and he shall have dominion over thee. 

**17** And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work: with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life. 

**18** Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth. 

**19** In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return. 

**20** And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living. 

**21** And the Lord /u/zjz made for Adam and his wife garments of skins, and clothed them. 

**22** And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil: now therefore lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever. 

**23** And the Lord /u/zjz sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken. 

**24** And he cast out Adam: and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. 

**Chapter 4**

And Adam knew Eve his wife; who conceived and brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a man through /u/zjz. 

**2** And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a husbandman. 

**3** And it came to pass after many days, that Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord. 

**4** Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat: and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings. 

**5** But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was exceeding angry, and his countenance fell. 

**6** And the Lord said to him: Why art thou angry? and why is thy countenance fallen? 

**7** If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but if ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it. 

**8** And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go forth abroad. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew him. 

**9** And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy brother Abel? And he answered: I know not: am I my brother’s keeper? 

**10** And he said to him: What hast thou done?

the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me from the earth. 

**11** Now therefore cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand. 

**12** When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth. 

**13** And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon. 

**14** Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy face I shall be hid, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: every one therefore that findeth me, shall kill me. 

**15** And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not so be: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him. 

**16** And Cain went out from the face of the Lord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at the east side of Eden. 

**17** And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch. 

**18** And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech, 

**19** Who took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the other Sella. 

**20** And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen. 

**21** And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs. 

**22** Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema. 

**23** And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sella: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising. 

**24** Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold. 

**25** Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and called his name Seth, saying: /u/zjz hath given me another seed for Abel, whom Cain slew. 

**26** But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos: this man began to call upon the name of the Lord. 

**Chapter 5**

This is the book of the generation of Adam. In the day that /u/zjz created man, he made him to the likeness of /u/zjz. 

**2** He created them male and female; and blessed them: and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. 

**3** And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son to his own image and likeness, and called his name Seth. 

**4** And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth, were eight hundred years: and he begot sons and daughters. 

**5** And all the time that Adam lived, came to nine hundred and thirty years, and he died. 

**6** Seth also lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enos. 

**7** And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.

**8** And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died. 

**9** And Enos lived ninety years, and begot Cainan. 

**10** After whose birth he lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.

**11** And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he died. 

**12** And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Malaleel. 

**13** And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel, eight hundred and forty years, and begot sons and daughters. 

**14** And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died. 

**15** And Malaleel lived sixty-five years and begot Jared. 

**16** And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared, eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters. 

**17** And all the days of Malaleel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died. 

**18** And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Henoch. 

**19** And Jared lived after he begot Henoch, eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. 

**20** And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died. 

**21** And Henoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Mathusala. 

**22** And Henoch walked with /u/zjz: and lived after he begot Mathusala, three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. 

**23** And all the days of Henoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. 

**24** And he walked with /u/zjz, and was seen no more: because /u/zjz took him. 

**25** And Mathusala lived a hundred and eightyseven years, and begot Lamech. 

**26** And Mathlusala lived after he begot Lamech, seven hundred and eighty-two years, and begot sons and daughters. 

**27** And all the days of Mathusala were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died. 

**28** And Lamech lived a hundred and eightytwo years, and begot a son. 

**29** And he called his name Noe, saying: This same shall comfort us from the works and labours of our hands on the earth, which the Lord hath cursed. 

**30** And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, five hundred and ninety-five years, and begot sons and daughters. 

**31** And all the days of Lamech came to seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died. And Noe, when he was five hundred years old, begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.

2021-04-27 00:54:06,wallstreetbets,"If I'm being completely honest, I check out what is being said here, look at the facts for myself, make a calculated call based on the chances (i.e. I have never yolo'd more than about 1k) and take the jump. Sometimes it's what people are hooting about here, most of the time it's other stocks that have a lot on their plate and are moving forward.

If you want to be extra conservative, put it in and S&P 500 mutual fund (or index fund) and leave it alone for a decade. I've made so so much doing that and the odds of that ever plummeting to absolute zero is next to impossible. If the S&P 500 is completely void of any value, then the entire earth is in the crapper and money probably won't matter as much as crops and water."

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Plinabulin, the next dumb pharma gamble The newest and greatest drug plinabulin is just around the corner. It was originally intended to be used as a chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer. That study is still in progress and will be reported by EOY, but the real play is in the concurrent use that was discovered along the way. Plinabulin seems to have immuno-stimulating properties, meaning it negates many of the dangerous side effects of chemotherapy. Trials finished last fall and reported good outcomes in preventing Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) when combined with G-CSF. This represents the first drug in 30 years that has made any headway into immunoprotection. If approved with is estimated to keep approximately 400,000 patients a year in the US out of the hospital and over 2,0000,000 patients a year in China. The drug will be combined with G-CSF which itself has a yearly market of 5 billion, plinabulins owner is currently only valued at 400 million.

The drug has already received the breakthrough drug status in both China and the US which should speed up the path to approval. The new drug application was filed on March 31 which begins a timer for drug approval by the FDA. For US approval, with the breakthrough status it should be approximately 8 months from the 31st, for China is could potentially be as soon as 4 months. The play here is to get in during the run up, the ticker was beaten down with the biopharma market in general the past two months and it has been tracking with the biopharm ETF XBI. The last two months have left the ticket at an ATL despite being closer to approval of what will be a standard of care drug within the next twelve months. The stock is currently trading at 10.62, the average analyst price is 33.25. The analysts price only takes into account the CIN indication, at this price the original chemotherapy use is included as a free lottery ticket.

I will make a longer post later if anybody is interested.

Position 8,097 shares at 13.48"

I own around 100k shares and I'm patiently waiting for the almost inevitable liftoff. I think it can take few months or a couple of years max to start to get the real valuation to shine through but I'm expecting at least 10x ROI on this one eventually.

2021-04-26 21:35:46,wallstreetbets,"Not even remotely priced in from what I can tell. Approval does seem inevitable but MC is at $400 mil. Just did an offering in the fall so it’s not like everyone is expecting massive dilution to stay afloat, either. There were a few rounds of dilution and it seems to have driven people away if they were ever there.

This is the most under the radar stock I’ve ever seen for its potential - there are like 3 of us active on Stocktwits and only *seven hundred twenty-seven* followers. Compare that to some other shitty clinical stage biotechs with no PDUFA in sight (and similar MC) that have 5k-15k followers.

So if you - or anyone - can generate a credible bear thesis I’d be excited to hear it. Seems too good to be true. I’m at 3100+ shares at $12 something. Hoping to get to 10k before approval but it’d be great to figure out what we’re missing before then!"

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Discovery (DISC.K) Is Grossly Undervalued Discovery is likely grossly undervalued following the Archegos mess. Basically, the Archegos liquidation caused the big banks to sell billions of dollars worth of stock which caused the share price to drop for no fundamental/business reasons. It's trading at about $33 per share when a roughly zero growth model yields a price target of around $40 - 45 per share (my price target is about $50). There's also a ton of short interest right now:

[DISC.K Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/wbe751sqrkv61.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f4a5987f9821636a4ef8590dd7a7bb1faab8362)

**Investment Thesis:**

* The Archegos Liquidation is a major non-economic reason for the price decline and potential undervaluation. The current EV/FCFF implies a WACC-Terminal Growth Rate spread of 13.5%. With a WACC of anywhere between 7-10%, DISC is undervalued if its long-term growth potential is not excessively negative.
* Although DISC has been on a slight decline in viewership in recent years, its niche reality television content has a proven stable popularity within a niche audience that should help DISC transition from cable to streaming in the long run. The core popularity of DISC-owned content should also grant DISC significant optionality in ways to monetize viewership.
* DISC has been and will continue to be a cash cow in the short run. DISC has averaged a 51.2% FCFF margin in the past 5 years. Moreover, DISC content has a favorable cost structure due to the low cost and capital requirements for producing reality TV shows. Thus, DISC’s near-term profitability will give it a large source of capital for reinvestment into its streaming business and new content production.
* The streaming industry is expected to consolidate rapidly in the future. This is simply a byproduct of having too many streaming platforms for viewers to choose from. DISC is in a good position to be acquired due to its cheap pricing and consolidation of niche unscripted non-fiction TV content. This could serve as a catalyst for downside protection--should DISC’s price fall too low, some other media giant will likely acquire DISC.

It happens so often that everyone who actually follows this should have known that their is a very high probability that the stock will fall after Q1 even if they did really well.

Reason Why? 

Who knows it's the fucking stock market there are worthless companies that are worth billions, and companies that go from nothing to blowing up over 1000% in one year."

2021-04-27 00:08:27,wallstreetbets,"That's pretty normal, as others in the thread have mentioned. The company outperformed estimates, but it was in line with what most people were hoping for (and even *below* what some important people were expecting). When people expect earnings to be good, they make moves *before* the earnings are reported. By the time earnings are reported, most of the moves have already been made, so the stock price doesn't change much or it goes down. As others have mentioned with Tesla though, it tends to go up a few days after earnings (maybe partially *because* people think it will go down that day, so they wait a few days to make the play)."

It is speculative, but there are bullish arguments from across the spectrum. It's leading the way in the field and they've (for the most part) continuously proven themselves capable of handling the increased publicity and scrutiny with a successful uplisting, acquisitions, trial progress, and so forth. Beyond the science and the business, simply the exciting prospect of this emerging industry, all the potential this area has, the comforting moral argument re: mental health/addiction, and the allure of drugs are all great for the stock price. I'm buying more as soon as premarket opens up for my broker. I expect it to be a thrilling day"

Been in a channel for 8 months & all of Wall Street knows Bill Miller just said AMZN will double in Barron's so they're just waiting for a reason to send it. 🚀[https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311](https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311)

Technically it looks like a 5-star set up on a chart. Sitting at ATH's right now waiting for a reason to break out. A big earnings beat sends it higher or a split sends it higher. If they don't have numbers that get them there I expect them to play the Split card. If we get an earnings beat plus a split then we're talking a once in a blue 🌕 move for a biz their size. Last time it consolidated this long it doubled in a leg up in 2-3 months.

If there's a 6 to 1 or more split I bet we see +10% Friday even on average earnings.

I figure Bezos wants to give Jassy a win as new CEO and doesn't want the stock to languish any longer. A split is an ace in his pocket he's held onto for years. Big reason its stalled is the fact that it's 4k freaking dollars. A split means retail can jump in on shares & call options.

An earnings beat means analyst after analyst will trip over each other upgrading their PT's over the next couple weeks.

If we get either good earnings or a split I think we have 4k upside in the next month at least.

Anyhow I've spent a lot of time doing DD on this and wanted to bring it to the fam. Would suck if I got rich/poor without you.

I think calls are the move since we're either in for sideways or 🚀🌕. I'm thinking **June 4 @ 4,000 strike.**

Going to war tomorrow. Would love to have fam beside me.

What say you?"

How are people *still* surprised that an earnings beat does not necessarily mean a stock will go up? There are many factors and past performance is not even close to the most important. The market is forward looking, especially this earnings season where sizable beats are very much expected and priced in. Focus on what the numbers mean about the trajectory of the company and pay attention to guidance, these are the big factors which affect share price movement after an earnings report

2021-04-27 01:03:47,wallstreetbets,"Phase II Trading: FearBased Trading, or, “Why Does Everything I Touch Turn to Crap?”

Many traders think that once they become more cautious, their trading will improve. They’re wrong. When traders decide that they don’t want to lose any more money, they unwittingly turn themselves into the “late entry” champions of the trading world. They wait and they wait and they make doubly sure that a trade looks good before they take it. In this scenario, the markets start to rally, but by the time the trader is absolutely convinced that this rally is for real, she is jumping in near the dead highs of the move. She and the rest of the traders who did this just gave the markets the fuel they needed to start moving down. Why? Because suddenly the market has a lot of stops being placed beneath it, and like wind on a forest fire, these stops will ignite a selloff. This safe, cautious entry quickly turns into a loss. The difference this time is that prudent traders religiously stick to their stops. The problem is that this overcautious behavior gives them terrible entries, and their odds of getting stopped out are extremely high. Yes, small losses are good, but if nearly every trade results in a small loss, the account will eventually be worn down.

2021-04-26 23:25:25,wallstreetbets,"it's the ""feet are dirty"" idea that gets warped in some people's brains when they are kids.   ""dirty"" becomes ""forbidden"" and ""erotic"" when they get older.   it's like an obsession with eating ass.  though assholes make more sense as they are closer to actual sex organs"
2021-04-26 23:18:36,wallstreetbets,So are you insinuating that people with a foot fetish are also a rapist?

2021-04-26 23:20:54,wallstreetbets,Exercising this early is pointless. You’re leaving money on the table by nullifying your theta.  You either exercise near expiration or sell the call at a price target you feel comfortable taking profits. Do not exercise early and do some research to understand this thoroughly.

2021-04-26 21:55:33,wallstreetbets,Shutup and buy GME
2021-04-26 22:00:39,wallstreetbets,Replace GME with MVIS and you’re correct
2021-04-26 21:55:54,wallstreetbets,Dude. You're on /r/WallstreetGMEStonk. What do you expect?
2021-04-27 02:57:32,wallstreetbets,I’ll show you my cock
2021-04-26 22:27:15,wallstreetbets,It is going to skyrocket. Congrats! I'm not getting in but it'll probably play out like MVIS did
2021-04-26 22:34:14,wallstreetbets,Too many are already in it for the long haul. Most know the trials that are well underway will bring waves of future catalysts. If it drops the next results are coming in may with more to follow
2021-04-26 22:58:37,wallstreetbets,"You made a ton of money, take it and move onto the next one."
2021-04-26 22:59:53,wallstreetbets,Sell and buy MVIS !

2021-04-26 23:11:56,wallstreetbets,2 months ago this post would have received 368 downvotes....so there’s that at least
2021-04-26 23:15:40,wallstreetbets,"I shit talked some dudes GME post on here Saturday and I get a chat from him today about it because he was right about their ""21 day cycle"". Like wtf guy"
2021-04-26 23:11:37,wallstreetbets,Try typing this same comment during daytime and count the downvotes. The apes are all kids with early bedtimes lol
2021-04-26 23:10:22,wallstreetbets,We made money?
2021-04-26 20:46:15,wallstreetbets,A strangle is guaranteed cash at this point If you can eat the premium

2021-04-27 01:04:47,wallstreetbets,read wsb everyday get a pulse of market make lots of money
2021-04-27 01:11:04,wallstreetbets,"So, what's the word? Profound? 😎"
2021-04-27 04:00:27,wallstreetbets,With good reason. Democrats want crude gone if at all possible. Scaled back at minimum. These infrastructure negotiations will shed more light on oil going forward
2021-04-27 03:08:31,wallstreetbets,Go back to sleep snow white
2021-04-27 04:22:59,wallstreetbets,Never go all in. You’re asking for dissappointment
2021-04-27 04:23:25,wallstreetbets,MVIS no doubt
2021-04-27 04:23:53,wallstreetbets,Diversify with wsb stonks. 99% mvis 1% gme

2021-04-26 22:19:31,wallstreetbets,That dude should be around children let alone talk about them
2021-04-26 23:00:56,wallstreetbets,Every other comment is MVIS what more do you want?
2021-04-26 23:02:11,wallstreetbets,"Admins? Where????

2021-04-26 23:01:44,wallstreetbets,It’s ok. Lots of $MVIIS being heard.
2021-04-26 23:01:24,wallstreetbets,"Prolly cuz they want you to earn flair first.

Just roll into Wendy’s and knock twice on the dumpster out back."
2021-04-27 04:26:35,wallstreetbets,Invest in a company that was ultimately failing before WSB saved it at x15 SP or a company with a bright future with big news imminent costing much less. Hard choice
2021-04-27 02:46:57,wallstreetbets,If you would’ve bought went it went up 60% 2 days up you would be up 100% if you bought yesterday you would be up 50%. If you buy this upcoming morning it’ll be up even more
2021-04-27 02:42:39,wallstreetbets,MNDM hasn't even reached its ATH it reached on the OTC exchange. On Nasdaq its valuation will be significantly higher
2021-04-27 02:48:57,wallstreetbets,"yes! You can still make a bit. open interest on 35c on 5/21 is over 60000, 30c at 20000. But that's also because 35 is the highest anyone selling"
2021-04-27 02:43:18,wallstreetbets,Because it's just getting started?
2021-04-26 23:14:51,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-26 23:20:19,wallstreetbets,What's the logic on MNMD? Why?
2021-04-27 03:04:20,wallstreetbets,Source?
2021-04-27 00:51:19,wallstreetbets,I own $MVIS and will hold and sell any time.
2021-04-27 00:50:03,wallstreetbets,"Jesus christ, fuck off."
2021-04-27 00:51:22,wallstreetbets,"Stop telling people what to do and fuck off. Tell people what you’re doing, don’t push your shit on others."
2021-04-26 23:56:54,wallstreetbets,Good luck
2021-04-26 23:56:12,wallstreetbets,time for me to put this foot in that boootaaay. MVIS isnt over boiiiiiiii

2021-04-26 20:00:19,wallstreetbets,"The investigation about how the government handled the pandemic (spoiler alert: poorly) starts tomorrow. I’m betting on a drop in the real value and maybe that could also pull back Vale, although its a private company"
2021-04-26 20:06:08,wallstreetbets,"Also say ""rise up lights"""
2021-04-26 20:09:48,wallstreetbets,Investing is definitely not smart
2021-04-26 20:08:28,wallstreetbets,"Reminds me of the pest: ""you want a tip, buy honda"""
2021-04-26 20:13:37,wallstreetbets,I'm tryna retire within the year tho 🤪
2021-04-26 20:23:10,wallstreetbets,I quit having her drive me. I now take an Uber because they don't take 40% of the money I earned giving handies.
2021-04-26 20:22:57,wallstreetbets,"That was how it used to be. On to the next one unless you could bring convincing DD...

But somehow people got stuck on one POS stonk and it divided this place."
2021-04-26 20:22:59,wallstreetbets,"I dunno, all PLTR does is ping pong between 21 and 25 but apparently no one here is tired of it...."

2021-04-27 01:56:02,wallstreetbets,"He said “low six figures”, honestly, how can he be so poor, it definitely must be frustrating."

2021-04-26 22:32:54,wallstreetbets,"I think so too, mnmd relatively cheap still"
2021-04-26 22:59:19,wallstreetbets,"People are gonna cash out of MVIS tomorrow. MNMD is only fkn $4.69, so it has a lot more room to run."
2021-04-26 22:22:46,wallstreetbets,He might have misspelled MDMA
2021-04-26 23:46:01,wallstreetbets,Not according to powerful people
2021-04-26 23:46:46,wallstreetbets,Don't tell him
2021-04-26 23:47:39,wallstreetbets,Bud is pure piss-water.
2021-04-26 20:14:22,wallstreetbets,Thetagang are the cockroaches of trading.  After everyone else nukes each other they'll still be there collecting that premium.
2021-04-26 23:22:37,wallstreetbets,That's 2 words. There are a variety of bifidas.
2021-04-26 23:36:36,wallstreetbets,its all night that counts
2021-04-27 03:37:18,wallstreetbets,i agree with this because you used words i don’t know
2021-04-27 05:24:40,wallstreetbets,how is not both lidar and potential partnership priced in if the price has tripled in a few days?
2021-04-27 05:20:24,wallstreetbets,See you in Elysium brother
2021-04-27 05:21:51,wallstreetbets,Too many things going on with this company $100 and higher is possible
2021-04-27 03:52:48,wallstreetbets,"Game changing tech, look at their emerging markets and competitors which they are 20 years ahead of and have 400 patents to show for it. The have mastered LBS and will dominate Lidar and augmented reality for years to come. Do you propose another company has superior Lidar, augmented reality, interactive projectors ready for this hungry market? The markets are still emerging but they have recently been validated With the Army’s IVAS deal. Lazr lidar has a 8.6 billion market cap. If MVIS had the same market cap MVIS share price would be $54 based on fair market value of one of their verticals. MVIS lidar will be announced any day and it’s said to be “best in class” These industries are worth billions and your still early"
2021-04-27 03:26:25,wallstreetbets,"If it doesn't squeeze tomorrow, don't worry. It'll happen the day after. If it doesn't, then the day after that."

2021-04-26 22:00:46,wallstreetbets,No but I’m up for a clinical trial. I did Johnson and Johnson for a cool 3k

2021-04-27 01:49:52,wallstreetbets,Better Print EOD. His speeches rarely every cause more than a temporary drop.
2021-04-26 22:49:04,wallstreetbets,"Guess I was looking at it from a revenue and EPS beat, didn’t listen to the actual call. Figures"
2021-04-27 03:23:01,wallstreetbets,MVIS is different though was starting its run before WSB caught onto it as the company has a lot of upcoming catalysts
2021-04-27 00:26:48,wallstreetbets,Couldn't tell you how many thousands I've gained and lost trying to time that bitch. I'm done chasing that white whale.
2021-04-26 20:05:23,wallstreetbets,Smart people admit they don't know way more than dumb people.

2021-04-26 20:50:34,wallstreetbets,Just shrooms 🍄🚀
2021-04-26 20:52:32,wallstreetbets,Both are still the play
2021-04-26 21:12:04,wallstreetbets,On a trip to Vegas I was up 3100$ playing video Black Jack. 20 minutes before I left I lost 1100$. Still finished up 2000$ on the weekend but all I could think about during the drive back to LA was the 1100$ I pissed away.
2021-04-26 21:48:54,wallstreetbets,Same.
2021-04-27 00:37:30,wallstreetbets,The only reason I’m trading is for that 2021 Gsxr
2021-04-27 04:23:33,wallstreetbets,Possibly by EOD at this rate. Insane.
2021-04-27 05:00:08,wallstreetbets,"I'm on both. GME for the long term gains, but MVIS for the immediate gains"
2021-04-27 04:37:25,wallstreetbets,It ticked briefly to 9 dollars
2021-04-26 20:55:41,wallstreetbets,Tsla beating earmings is priced in for the next 100 yrs

2021-04-27 05:42:49,wallstreetbets,I think this one is satire
2021-04-27 05:49:25,wallstreetbets,Thank you for this tidbit of information. Do you happen to have any paid discord rooms where you can share me some more of this master trader knowledge?
2021-04-26 20:49:34,wallstreetbets,Early and wrong are the same thing. This cat has no idea.
2021-04-26 22:38:23,wallstreetbets,Lmao

2021-04-26 23:33:29,wallstreetbets,"Nobody cares about the earnings. If, like many believe, they announce the completion of a best in class Lidar sample, they will comfortably overtake LAZR’s MC, which is still about a 2x from here"

2021-04-26 21:01:20,wallstreetbets,"The crash is gonna need a catalyst tho. 

Aside from all of the knowns, w/ rates soo low, WTF are the rich gonna put their money outside of stonks?

If inflation is real, then cash is the last place you wanna be. 

ESPECIALLY as Yellen looks to do a rug pull and regulate fake money in the name of national security, terrorism and tax evasion. Even a fart of her plan laid out in real terms will most likely cause a 25-50% selloff across the board.  You can’t really prevent money laundering, tax evasion and terrorism funding without UNMASKING fake money owners afterall..."

2021-04-27 00:51:15,wallstreetbets,"Damn you’re that hurt cause you didn’t buy it? Don’t worry you can still buy it, it will go up for you tomorrow"
2021-04-27 00:52:51,wallstreetbets,I think it’s pretty evident that is literally what I’m doing. I see people in here saying buy and hold about all sorts of stocks all day so suck my dick
2021-04-27 03:21:51,wallstreetbets,The haters will downvote but there’s nothing mavis can announce that will keep the momentum going. I’m still long from $10.90 but there’s no way I will be holding on Thursday.

2021-04-26 21:02:33,wallstreetbets,Can't sell credits forever to support that 1000 p/e. When tsla eventually starts tanking it's going to be beautiful.
2021-04-26 21:10:23,wallstreetbets,That's true. The magics  over
2021-04-26 21:46:07,wallstreetbets,i’m just messing around bro. the folks on r/AMD_STOCK seem to think it’s going to drill after earnings like it always does. seems like the play around here is to inverse what everyone else says. i’m interested in what it’ll look like tomorrow. either way goodluck!
2021-04-27 10:11:05,wallstreetbets,You were right man. Being objective always saves the day
2021-04-26 23:14:38,wallstreetbets,I’m in. Haven’t even looked at the technicals. But fuck you apes. I’m in wit you.
2021-04-27 02:02:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but my point is that it's a super risky play for a (relatively) small payoff.

QQQ calls are way safer, and have paid out more this week."
2021-04-27 09:59:15,wallstreetbets,"only trade what you can afford to invest, as in like act like it's gone."
2021-04-26 23:37:00,wallstreetbets,Bruh they gaped 150% in a week _on the expectation they have that already_.  It's priced in.

2021-04-26 22:32:19,wallstreetbets,"Nasdaq tomorrow ! 
MNMD new ticker"
2021-04-26 22:30:12,wallstreetbets,Doesn't really matter now that it's getting listed on nasdaq tom. They all will let you buy it. I prefer TD Ameritrade since they let me submit orders after hours (but they don't go though till open). That way I can set it up nice and early and always cancel if premarket is fuckey.
2021-04-27 02:00:51,wallstreetbets,Don’t let nahog get to you bro.  We’re all here for each other. He’s just upset cause he bought TLRY at 300
2021-04-26 20:26:02,wallstreetbets,😒 I know. My hands are too calloused.

2021-04-26 23:16:41,wallstreetbets,"HAHA. If I had a nickel for every time I bought a ticker without even looking at the company name, I could retire from this trading shit

EDIT: Fuckin love that style."
2021-04-27 02:08:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah my point is just that this is WSB. Whats up with the shares? Anyone can buy shares and hold them. Some dude has been holding since 1995 or some shit lol. Imagine 25 years later getting a return...
2021-04-27 11:12:03,wallstreetbets,Generally good advice but this man is being fisted on commissions. Holy hell OP find another broker. It isn't even OTC anymore.

2021-04-27 11:29:26,wallstreetbets,"I’m leaning more towards AMC.  we have confirmation from their CEO that it’s being shorted. It’s up right now massively, which means they’re losing money. Also we have reopening, so not only do we win in terms of meme exposure/trading but in fundamentals as well. Theaters aren’t even really open yet and we’re at this price (a little less than 12) So worse case scenario it isn’t a squeeze and we only get 30%-100% gains. Best case scenario it’s a short squeeze and we go to the moon. It’s also worth nothing that if GME gets squeezed, AMC is basically guaranteed to go up. However, if AMC goes up there is no guarantee for GME, additionally, if GME gets hammered AMC can and probably will be mostly unaffected"
2021-04-27 16:11:46,wallstreetbets,Well this didn’t last well. Gme just disappoints
2021-04-26 20:31:01,wallstreetbets,I'm new here. What does this mean?
2021-04-26 20:32:44,wallstreetbets,is it too late to buy at \~200 tomorrow at market open?
2021-04-26 20:40:51,wallstreetbets,My friend has sent me these posts on a weekly basis for 3 months and everytime he’s convinced it’s gonna be “tomorrow bro”
2021-04-26 20:42:48,wallstreetbets,"Legitimate question here... how are ""they"" going to allow us all to become overnight millionaires? Won't they just hit the circuit breakers again? Won't they just cheat and lie right in front of our eyes so we don't get paid? 

In other words, how can they screw us out of this ever actually happening, or is it eventually inevitable no matter what? I'm trying to explain this all to a doubting friend but I'm too retarded myself to understand it."
2021-04-26 20:42:50,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure. By the sounds of it Gamestop has spent the last few weeks diluting shares to gain around $800m in cash, which basically screws us over a bit. Unless I am dumb and missing something?"
2021-04-26 20:43:29,wallstreetbets,"I just want to buy a lambo and crash it

2021-04-26 20:43:52,wallstreetbets,I want my tendies but who bought the 3.M shares ? I hope shorts didn't get to sweep them all up. I want WANT the squeeze - just sayin'.
2021-04-26 20:44:11,wallstreetbets,Jesus christ just how many times is this thing going to spike. How can they not have gradually eased off of their position by now. How deep is the god damned hole they're in? I'm genuinely angry.

2021-04-26 21:14:47,wallstreetbets,If I had a share for everytime I saw a post like this I would be in good shape for when the squeeze finally happens
2021-04-26 21:18:55,wallstreetbets,How high could it reasonably be expected to go?
2021-04-26 21:23:32,wallstreetbets,This chart makes me feel happy

2021-04-27 00:18:32,wallstreetbets,As a non-stock guy... Is the blue line going through the red circles a good thing? Or does more color variations = money?

2021-04-27 16:07:46,wallstreetbets,This...*this* graph is surely the one to be right this time after weeks of failed “squeeze incoming” graphs.

2021-04-27 00:03:04,wallstreetbets,thats not how you use a fib...
2021-04-27 14:27:10,wallstreetbets,"Being a squeeze, does that predict the price will go up more in the next few days and good to buy Calls here? Sorry guys, still learning here!"
2021-04-27 00:13:40,wallstreetbets,The good news is all of the GME execs are  cashing out at $30-40m each.  So at least you guys made some people rich.
2021-04-26 23:45:10,wallstreetbets,"Sorry but this is kinda starting to feel like the end of the world cult stuff. Bullshit chartist, nothing happens,  ""welp, it didn't happen this time but the new date is xx/xx/xxxx.""

Downvote me but if the squeeze doesnt come, wake TF up."

2021-04-27 02:00:48,wallstreetbets,Guys. I’m kinda retarded and just want to double check how to buy without market order.  Do I buy with limit ?   Like example. If it’s at 180$    So I limit buy at 181$ right?  Or am I too stupid? Thanks

2021-04-27 15:17:36,wallstreetbets,"Hedge Fund short squeezes are a bit different than Small Fry short squeezes.  All seems to depend whether the shorts are using borrowed money or are sitting on plenty of cash while they short.  The small fry shorting 50 shares a shot if they're sitting on a lot of cash their brokers let them do all sorts of tricks.  Shorting 50 GME at 183 is a lot different than shorting 20 mill @ 15.  BUT--GME just sold shares for half a bill cash at average price 157 so there will be market makers working overtime to support that level.  Time to close shorts and retire to the sidelines and wait to buy GME at a more decent price around 50.  Three years from now GME will legitimately be at 180 on its fundamentals--but NOT now.  Think, I shoulda bot2cover last Friday but I was out working.  Remember Work?  It's what you do so you can buy stocks--and I don't do leverage.  I have a pet mortgage--too small to refi but too little ROI to pay it off.  Condo fee is double the mortgage.  Again, be aware of what you're really doing.  Like you can make a small fortune in the restaurant business.  A friend asked me once how to make a quick 20k in ""the market"".  I said it will take you six months but here's how: Get a job on The Street that pays 40k a year and quit after six months!"

2021-04-27 05:02:51,wallstreetbets,Do people really think GME is going to squeeze again? I guess bag holders have to hope
2021-04-26 20:05:30,wallstreetbets,I think it needs to hit those previous $200 highs to have a recovery. Until then $50 is imminent...but a good bounce up from there
2021-04-26 22:52:44,wallstreetbets,Do any of you retards actually know how to read this chart?

2021-04-27 00:23:53,wallstreetbets,"I have a question, if margin call happens and HF are asked to cover the shorts. Can they cover the shorts and short the stock at the same time?"
2021-04-27 01:14:23,wallstreetbets,"... yea it's coming for a while now, but nothing yet.. 😕"
2021-04-27 12:43:13,wallstreetbets,"If you gents like a good stock roller coaster ride then, lets take  SIX FLAGS past THE $50 mark!!!!  KINGDA KA!!!!!!!!!!"
2021-04-27 14:25:19,wallstreetbets,Squeeze being good or bad??
2021-04-27 14:31:41,wallstreetbets,Can someone please help me understand the Squeeze. Only been trading a few months. I’m retarded. Thanks
2021-04-27 15:23:12,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-26 20:20:45,wallstreetbets,"same, hope I don't miss out... started today and takes 5-7 business days"
2021-04-26 20:04:58,wallstreetbets,So glad I moved my shit out of that stupid shithole company.
2021-04-26 22:20:22,wallstreetbets,Same for me. Started transfer last Thursday and it hit Fidelity today
2021-04-26 23:30:57,wallstreetbets,Bro I finally got off RH just this past week. Shares finished transferring yesterday! Had that feeling that I better now or never.
2021-04-26 22:14:55,wallstreetbets,"Same 🤦🏻‍♂️ 
I did it Thursday"
2021-04-26 23:32:20,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your sacrifice
2021-04-26 21:33:12,wallstreetbets,same brother. this is the way
2021-04-26 22:48:47,wallstreetbets,"should have done that wayyyyy sooner. duh?

&#x200B;

Buy and Hold. Our time is now"
2021-04-26 23:03:23,wallstreetbets,Same here. Started the transfer at like 2:30 am and now I’m horrified
2021-04-26 23:41:10,wallstreetbets,Literally started my own transfer from Robinhood to Fidelity on Friday
2021-04-26 23:42:37,wallstreetbets,"I was so sketched to transfer it all to Fidelity last month, worried I’d miss this, here we are a month later and I got my tendies safe in the vault with the rest of Fidelity’s $5 TRILLION assets under management"
2021-04-26 22:10:02,wallstreetbets,Where did you move them to?
2021-04-26 22:38:42,wallstreetbets,Same over here! I initiated transfer on 4/20 & it only took 2 days.
2021-04-26 23:25:27,wallstreetbets,Thank you brother
2021-04-26 23:39:16,wallstreetbets,I also started my transfer last night 🤣
2021-04-27 00:04:23,wallstreetbets,I transferred to Fidelity at the beginning of March and RH still hasn’t sent the cost basis over. Though the shares transferred after 3 days. But I did a partial transfer and RH did not transfer some of the positions I listed.
2021-04-26 22:10:40,wallstreetbets,Same!
2021-04-26 22:35:56,wallstreetbets,Same. Started Thursday.
2021-04-26 22:39:29,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-04-26 23:28:44,wallstreetbets,So am I screwed?
2021-04-26 22:36:57,wallstreetbets,"Same here, except from WF. Scared to death I’m gonna miss the squeeze while it’s in transition"
2021-04-26 23:06:20,wallstreetbets,"After this squeeze is over, how do we take down Robinhood?"
2021-04-26 22:38:42,wallstreetbets,Same over here! I initiated transfer on 4/20 & it only took 2 days.
2021-04-26 22:58:00,wallstreetbets,"Hmmmm I want to make the transfer to Webull, but too afraid the transfer may fuck something up with my options while the squeeze is happening and I lose all profit somehow. I know your assets are supposed to carry over as is, but still scary to think about. Lol"
2021-04-26 23:48:21,wallstreetbets,Same smh
2021-04-26 23:52:55,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-27 00:02:08,wallstreetbets,Thanks for ur sacrifice
2021-04-27 00:36:55,wallstreetbets,"Big fear of mine honestly, hope your transfer goes through ASAP!"
2021-04-27 00:47:05,wallstreetbets,Fuck you Vanguard is making it difficult for me to transfer
2021-04-27 01:05:18,wallstreetbets,"""This?"" You mean someone drawing a bunch of circles and lines?

Nothing has happened yet."
2021-04-27 01:20:22,wallstreetbets,Can I ask when they requested the 75?  I want to transfer but want to know if I need to deposit that first
2021-04-27 01:24:10,wallstreetbets,Breh I initiated a partial transfer from webull last Thursday and I'm watching it starttttttt
2021-04-27 01:35:54,wallstreetbets,Lol i literally did the same thing today.
2021-04-27 02:22:47,wallstreetbets,"How long did the transfer take? Mine are in the “in transit” stage and I’m scared of missing the squeeze with those shares. I have others, but I’d like to have 10mil + instead of just 10mil"
2021-04-27 02:32:17,wallstreetbets,BRUH SAME. I just finished transferring them today lmao.
2021-04-27 10:01:19,wallstreetbets,same.
2021-04-27 10:41:31,wallstreetbets,"Nothing has happened, notice the meme flair, there is no analysis or dd here, just bias confirmation. Short interest is 15.70% currently. LOL"
2021-04-27 02:20:07,wallstreetbets,Be aware that they could be trying to fake squeeze to get rid of the paperhands
2021-04-27 03:10:56,wallstreetbets,"> nice, I wanted to ~~be a billionaire since january anyways~~ regain my losses from buying the peak"
2021-04-27 07:18:17,wallstreetbets,Best Nokia

2021-04-26 20:38:09,wallstreetbets,Please don’t buy into the options again. Just get stock. Not financial advice.
2021-04-26 20:38:15,wallstreetbets,CojonesDance
2021-04-26 20:42:10,wallstreetbets,Squeeze before the end of May and it’ll be the best birthday gift I’ve ever received.

2021-04-26 21:50:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this rocket travel felt fast with all the good company on board."
2021-04-26 21:51:37,wallstreetbets,I wanna buy more shares
2021-04-26 22:45:06,wallstreetbets,I just want to pay off my student loans.

2021-04-27 11:58:12,wallstreetbets,ape holding stonk ... but at most ape will have 10k more to play with cause ape poor
2021-04-26 22:55:44,wallstreetbets,Me too! MNMD trades tomorrow on Nasdaq. Gme has been good to me but moving out tomorrow.
2021-04-26 20:48:33,wallstreetbets,Value = Deep
2021-04-26 22:52:49,wallstreetbets,"That would truly haunt me more than it going to zero. Like many times more.

It’s like Tesla. I sold my shares at about 400 (pre split) for a tidy profit! :("
2021-04-26 21:47:29,wallstreetbets,"Ha, first time I watched the chart in awhile today. I had a dream last night that it went from $170 to $589 in about 2 minutes so I had to tune in today."
2021-04-26 21:32:21,wallstreetbets,"I had the same dream Saturday that it ran to 1000. I never remember my dreams but I remember this one . My brain switched to something else after 1,000. So to the rise of more tendies"
2021-04-27 00:37:14,wallstreetbets,"I had a dream that i was out shopping and i was looking at gme on my phone and it kept rising but the app started malfunctioning (even in my dreams robinhood is shit) and the number $4000 flickered for a second and then it was back down to $400 and diving, while i'm screaming OMG OMG the whole time cause i didn't get to sell any of them when it was $4000. Morning dreams are always super vivid like that"
2021-04-27 00:48:20,wallstreetbets,Apes! Remember it’s important to get our control numbers and vote in the upcoming proxy vote so our opinion as shareholders is heard.
2021-04-27 01:24:30,wallstreetbets,Holy fucking shit I had a gme dream too last night wtf
2021-04-27 00:20:53,wallstreetbets,Trust your dreams and don't sell in the way up 😉🍻
2021-04-27 06:20:55,wallstreetbets,"This is why I am only selling when itls life-changing. 100k is a lot for me, but not life changing."
2021-04-27 00:11:07,wallstreetbets,"Eee sol? 

Pamp eet"
2021-04-27 03:54:54,wallstreetbets,Why you should sell AFTER the peak
2021-04-27 06:00:47,wallstreetbets,"I read about GME going to almost $200 AH high and dreamt about it squeezing.  
First jump was to $8k, then it went to $12k but I couldn't sell. My phone and laptop seemd to be full of bloatware which made it so incredibly slow, or I didn't have a connection or my clicks didn't register. It was a very, very frustrating dream"
2021-04-26 23:50:38,wallstreetbets,Tails of the paper hand bitch. Stop reading bad bedtime stories
2021-04-27 01:34:33,wallstreetbets,"Its going to millions, don't be a paper handed bitch"
2021-04-27 00:09:26,wallstreetbets,Opportunity cost a very real thing
2021-04-27 00:47:11,wallstreetbets,Sounds more like a nightmare
2021-04-27 01:23:54,wallstreetbets,Lmfao that fever dreams been every waking minute of the last 3 months.
2021-04-27 04:23:45,wallstreetbets,I read this same thing like a month ago.
2021-04-27 04:39:48,wallstreetbets,I hope you bought back in at 100.000
2021-04-27 05:14:52,wallstreetbets,"Had a dream last night, too
Sold all my shares at 1800€ per share 🤤"
2021-04-27 05:34:57,wallstreetbets,"I do not believe this to be a dream, but a divine vision from the Tendieman himself.  You have been blessed with great wisdom.  Rejoice!"
2021-04-27 05:46:50,wallstreetbets,Did you buy back in at 5k?
2021-04-27 05:56:25,wallstreetbets,That's why I have 2 shares
2021-04-27 06:30:02,wallstreetbets,Holy shit! I had a dream it went to 800! I only sold a few shares.
2021-04-27 07:46:11,wallstreetbets,That’s why you sell some on the way up but save some for the other side of the curve.
2021-04-27 07:53:27,wallstreetbets,"If you look at L2 data the last few weeks/months, after a certain price point - around $250s or so - the asks immediately jump to like $5000, $18000, $50,000, etc. So, it could be that you could see GME price run upto 250+ and you go to bed that night hoping it goes higher. Then you wake up in the morning and the price in premarket is like $25,000."
2021-04-26 22:42:07,wallstreetbets,Okay Ryan Gosling.
2021-04-26 20:08:15,wallstreetbets,And my axe.
2021-04-26 20:21:51,wallstreetbets,"No comma needed, unless you were addressing an ape named “jacked”"
2021-04-26 20:43:54,wallstreetbets,Consider my brain wrinkled
2021-04-26 20:52:22,wallstreetbets,A well placed coma.
2021-04-26 23:05:40,wallstreetbets,Consider my zipples tickled!
2021-04-27 00:30:29,wallstreetbets,"Well, yeah, I always do."
2021-04-27 03:14:14,wallstreetbets,JACKED HANDS DIAMOND TITS
2021-04-27 03:32:26,wallstreetbets,"Balls, jilled."
2021-04-27 09:26:35,wallstreetbets,Are you feeling it??
2021-04-26 23:31:30,wallstreetbets,I got that mark this morning before it started climbing!
2021-04-27 03:05:40,wallstreetbets,"I'm in triple digits on my mom's account, that's nothing whatsoever"
2021-04-26 20:31:00,wallstreetbets,I could have given you so many better options but u choose to waste money on memes lololol.i laugh at all you clowns so funny
2021-04-26 20:36:02,wallstreetbets,I might sell some but I will hold 1 share to 1mln
2021-04-26 21:03:31,wallstreetbets,"If millon ape hold one share, all ape together strong."

2021-04-26 21:34:54,wallstreetbets,3 shares here. Hoping for enough to put a down payment on a house. But I'm a realist and I know I'll be my cities first billionaire.
2021-04-26 21:58:05,wallstreetbets,3 share gang represent!
2021-04-26 20:16:23,wallstreetbets,What number would you sell at?
2021-04-26 20:25:32,wallstreetbets,What’s the projection?
2021-04-26 20:29:26,wallstreetbets,3.23 shares checking in
2021-04-26 20:49:41,wallstreetbets,"Just a little patience, yeeeeaaaaah"
2021-04-26 20:54:40,wallstreetbets,"I just bought my first and only share. Let's do it! I'm not here often, what do people think the floor is? My imagination?!"
2021-04-26 21:28:40,wallstreetbets,2 share gang didn't sell at 420 not selling now
2021-04-26 21:37:56,wallstreetbets,"Excuse me, is this the 1 share club??"
2021-04-26 22:12:05,wallstreetbets,I got 1.33 shares yohoo!
2021-04-26 22:28:52,wallstreetbets,"I too, have 1 share. I'm more into amc, lower hanging fruit. But I bought 1 at 69$ and been holding strong since it bounced off around 50 bucks."
2021-04-26 22:46:43,wallstreetbets,"7 shares gang, do you think it will be enough for a new rs6?"
2021-04-27 01:31:44,wallstreetbets,3 share gang!! 🙌🏻
2021-04-27 02:00:15,wallstreetbets,You did good today. Power to the players
2021-04-27 06:45:01,wallstreetbets,I gave my best friend money to buy 2 shares yesterday. And he thanked me for bringing meaning to his life again. He bought in at 155ish and watched the price go up. He was like a kid again.
2021-04-26 21:24:11,wallstreetbets,"God, same.  I don’t care about retiring early, just having the luxury to move to part time while I live off a small percentage of my gains, 🔥 style."
2021-04-26 20:50:07,wallstreetbets,"My dream is honestly a 1 to 9 or 2 to 10.

I prefer to have easy mornings, eat lunch and then go to work."
2021-04-26 20:36:31,wallstreetbets,"Man I can't take the daily checks. I'm with you on it that, I have 10 and was pleasantly surprised today."

*IM IN THIS COMMENT AND I DONT LIKE IT*"
2021-04-26 20:19:31,wallstreetbets,started transferring my RH account and 44 shares to Fidelity today... hope I don't miss out on this
2021-04-26 20:29:54,wallstreetbets,You still have a chance to hold and not sell until after it comes down from $10M.
2021-04-26 20:49:19,wallstreetbets,Something relatable to many people about this comment. Have my upvote.
2021-04-26 21:14:42,wallstreetbets,Don't fuck it up now by selling early
2021-04-26 22:02:10,wallstreetbets,Don't worry. You still can mess it up. Plenty of time.
2021-04-27 01:41:41,wallstreetbets,Easier to hold shares if you forgot you had em! They were just  starting to slip my mind when I read this
2021-04-27 08:29:48,wallstreetbets,theres always time to fuck it up.  dont worry.
2021-04-26 21:40:09,wallstreetbets,Ehh unless he posted position screen shots hes most likely lying. No broker is just going to let him sell naked calls on GME without being at least cash secured
2021-04-26 21:28:24,wallstreetbets,Normally I'd say don't let petty revenge get in the way and blind you. In this case. Get 2 Ferraris and 2 lambos and rub it in your ex's face
2021-04-26 22:11:23,wallstreetbets,It was never off the menu.
2021-04-26 23:42:30,wallstreetbets,Let them both fly.

2021-04-27 01:17:05,wallstreetbets,That’s enough for a hundred million
2021-04-26 22:13:26,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow should be interesting!
2021-04-26 20:02:16,wallstreetbets,"This is the dip, anything below 500 is a steal"
2021-04-27 07:12:49,wallstreetbets,It means HOLD

2021-04-26 21:06:53,wallstreetbets,Depends on whether the Whitehouse and the SEC side with the hedgefunds or the retail investor

People who make actual money don’t waste their time fixated on a single company and spamming the same rubbish every single day lol."
2021-04-26 21:11:31,wallstreetbets,"You could, but in that case I lose money. So I won’t make that line."
2021-04-27 11:31:20,wallstreetbets,LMAO amc is a lost little boy that follows gme’s coat tails and it will always be that way. Notice when amc makes a move up gme is trading sideways and when gme moves up amc follows
2021-04-26 20:56:34,wallstreetbets,Tell me you learned about WSB from mainstream news outlets without telling me you learned about WSB from mainstream news outlets
2021-04-26 21:28:37,wallstreetbets,GME is an awful first stock to play but I guess this is wsb. Hope he remains a friend after all this.

Or signup for Jim Cramers onlyfans and he will spoon-feed you shit he wants to stick to the wall."
2021-04-27 05:21:45,wallstreetbets,He’s waiting the real squeeze so unlikely you’ll hear until then.

2021-04-27 00:10:18,wallstreetbets, Cursing your paper hands
2021-04-27 00:21:05,wallstreetbets,"Literally. Just be smarter about when you buy, and learn to hold instead of being a paper handed bitch.

You play the day trading game, you risk missing the rocket."
2021-04-27 00:22:17,wallstreetbets,Never stopped being a thing. DFV's all in should have put everyone on notice.
2021-04-26 23:52:08,wallstreetbets,Why do you give a fuck? Cry more.
2021-04-27 00:06:00,wallstreetbets,"Because nobody can predict the stock market dipshit.

Position or get the fuck outta here."
2021-04-27 09:26:13,wallstreetbets,Stop asking rational questions
2021-04-26 23:50:39,wallstreetbets,You are actually retarded if you think this is a worthless security.
2021-04-26 23:22:46,wallstreetbets,Tradingview
2021-04-27 00:50:05,wallstreetbets,Ummm
2021-04-27 02:07:31,wallstreetbets,"Many days, possibly weeks. Don't set sell limits until we reach the peak and start dipping down."
2021-04-27 05:16:13,wallstreetbets,Tradingview
2021-04-27 05:04:45,wallstreetbets,"Someone wants to buy at market, and no one wants to sell low, so they set their sell limit 20 bucks above current(160), the guy buying at market now has to buy at 180 i stead of 160. This all happens incrementally, with increases or decreases in price depending on where people are willing to buy/sell and in today's market a lot of it is done automatically through algorithms.

Meaning the algo's can push theprice up ordown very quickly, more quivkly than people.. so you get a hold on the price if it decreases or increases too quickly."
2021-04-27 09:02:22,wallstreetbets,Cuz its logarithmic
2021-04-27 15:19:47,wallstreetbets,Regarding restaurans and fortunes...you start with a big one..
2021-04-26 22:19:13,wallstreetbets,"Yep! When those same people believe the underlying thesis of shorts havent covered to still be true. Doesnt sound as crazy when you look at the whole picture, rather than using a straw man argument."
2021-04-27 00:03:51,wallstreetbets,Because it's doing well.
2021-04-27 05:26:40,wallstreetbets,Can you even read the DDs?
2021-04-26 20:24:47,wallstreetbets,"It won't drop to $50 with the shelf offering completed and long term debt taken care of, meaning $100 becomes the new conservative floor"
2021-04-26 23:12:59,wallstreetbets,No
2021-04-26 22:28:25,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, but I'm making money scalping calls on this shit and have almost paid off my share cost basis so why do I care if I have to wait until the company actually turns it around?"

2021-04-27 00:10:53,wallstreetbets,They loose millions every day they don’t cover. If they would have covered in January it wasn’t that bad for them but we are talking about 4MONTH of interest and millions lost just by not doing what they where supposed to do COVER THEIR SHORTS!!
2021-04-26 23:54:51,wallstreetbets,"Not worth the time, stay poor."
2021-04-27 00:07:12,wallstreetbets,"No one have to prove you anything, you’ll see it yourself."
2021-04-27 07:36:43,wallstreetbets,You don't understand what a squeeze is.
2021-04-27 00:46:32,wallstreetbets,Cringe
2021-04-27 05:28:37,wallstreetbets,Shut up

2021-04-26 23:31:35,wallstreetbets,Parabolas look like straight lines on a log scale.
2021-04-26 20:08:58,wallstreetbets,Please for the love of god tell me you don’t actually think it will be 10 or 20k a share

2021-04-26 21:35:36,wallstreetbets,u/ForteIV 's shares in Robinhood were actually the dark shares that Citadel and others kept selling back and forth to drive the price down.
2021-04-26 20:40:59,wallstreetbets,Only took me 3-4 I think. GL
2021-04-26 22:33:14,wallstreetbets,"Took me 2 business days thru Fidelity. Don’t worry, squeeze takes a couple of days, you’ll be fine."
2021-04-26 22:30:23,wallstreetbets,To Fidelity?
2021-04-26 22:41:01,wallstreetbets,Same here took 3 days did it last week
2021-04-26 23:36:45,wallstreetbets,"Mine was done in 2, did a full transfer from RH to fidelity, squeeze will take days, your good and you will be safe, cya on the moon"
2021-04-26 23:36:03,wallstreetbets,I requested a partial transfer for GME on Sunday and it says it was completed today.  So it literally took 1 business day.  I still don't see the shares in my fidelity account but it says that the shares will be delivered tomorrow.
2021-04-26 23:40:44,wallstreetbets,Mine took less than 2 business days.
2021-04-27 00:11:52,wallstreetbets,Should be all good. But good luck anywho. Hopefully it swaps over quickly!
2021-04-27 01:02:41,wallstreetbets,"Probably a good thing to be honest, won’t sell on dips 😂"
2021-04-27 01:05:05,wallstreetbets,I did it over Easter weekend- one biz day.
2021-04-27 01:53:05,wallstreetbets,"Took me 2 days, you should be good"
2021-04-27 05:58:09,wallstreetbets,"No worries brötha, squeeze is gonna take at the VERY least 1 week"
2021-04-27 06:52:20,wallstreetbets,Moved mine from RH to Fidelity. They estimated 5-7 business days but it only took 3.
2021-04-27 08:34:23,wallstreetbets,The final squeeze will take over a week don’t worry.
2021-04-27 10:57:43,wallstreetbets,It should be less I was told the same and everyone seems to be around 2-4 days max. I left around half on robinhood because I was scared my shares would be in transfer when we moon. Best of luck let’s go GME!
2021-04-27 12:35:40,wallstreetbets,"Forgive me but I know nothing does this mean ape together strong join in and buy, or if you already have the stock hold the line and stay?"
2021-04-26 22:37:20,wallstreetbets,Thats not good.
2021-04-26 22:48:59,wallstreetbets,I hope more follow you. Too many RH screen shots in WSB still.
2021-04-27 00:09:36,wallstreetbets,I noticed they kept .5 of a GME share when my transfer was complete.what’s up with that?
2021-04-27 01:19:14,wallstreetbets,nah you should be fine. I set up my fidelity account to margin prior to transfer and it took 3 business days
2021-04-27 09:40:18,wallstreetbets,Well it looks like its out of RH but not to my new brokerage yet

2021-04-26 21:34:13,wallstreetbets,"You're really harshing the flippant tone with your real world bullshit. I've got a mortgage and student loans, impending medical shit, don't hear me bitching about it. 

I just deleted my accounts and declared myself a sovereign citizen like any one else would."
2021-04-26 21:34:49,wallstreetbets,"I only have one share, I'm only in it for the memes and to support the cause. I'm a broke ape trying to get married so I can't invest even if I truly believe. But it would be so nice to make a few bucks at least, to help with this unexpectedly expensive emigration. The US government just does not want to let me go :/

Good luck apes and friends!"
2021-04-26 21:42:04,wallstreetbets,Keep that mortgage.... you’ll need every deduction possible to not get raked over the coals when you’re swimming in tendies

2021-04-26 22:59:51,wallstreetbets,"Don’t. Assuming you have a low interest rate, you make more than that rate by investing that money you would have spent paying off the mortgage. 

Though yeah, it would be nice to be debt free."
2021-04-26 23:00:23,wallstreetbets,I just want to pay off the debt so I can start saving for a mortgage now instead of paying for a degree I didn’t need
2021-04-26 23:05:03,wallstreetbets,"I just wanna not starve. Maybe I'll treat myself and go see a doctor, too! ;)"
2021-04-26 23:05:04,wallstreetbets,Hold. Make it so everyone - not just you - can pay off their mortgage.

2021-04-27 00:19:31,wallstreetbets,Way more fun getting rich together. What a lonely life never being able to compare lambos and have no one who can relate when you share stories about your wife’s bf.
2021-04-26 20:19:32,wallstreetbets,I mean we are inherently selfish. That's why there's a prisoners dilemma

2021-04-27 00:30:08,wallstreetbets,I sold my Tesla at around the same price... except I then stepped away from actively trading for a bit. I only found out 2 months ago that Tesla was a short squeeze and went seriously high! Holy crud! If I had any knowledge of a high short interest I would have happy and easily stayed in!
2021-04-27 00:44:53,wallstreetbets,"I sold 563 shares of gme for 18/share... 4 dollars profit per share. This was in December 2020. I believed in the short squeeze too, just decided to book some profit. I later FOMOd back in for 250 shares at 20/share and sold for 42/share.... 4 days before it hit $483."
2021-04-27 00:50:13,wallstreetbets,"I sold at -$30k. Took out margin to get it back, but still a mountaintop to climb. Feel rubbish...for now."

2021-04-27 01:59:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Plus, being able to risk a career change just for fun. I feel like I can be much more productive in other areas that I unlocked in skill but the poor man's game I play currently only has so many story lines. With Gamestop, power goes to the player"

2021-04-26 23:53:47,wallstreetbets,Trying to be helpful mate. Real investing is about being pragmatic not self fulfilling prophecies in your charts.  Good luck to you.

2021-04-27 12:22:51,wallstreetbets,If the whole graph was in log it would be fine but it’s only half the graph. Look at webull or yahoo finance and zoom out. You will not have the same “trend line” this man created. Graph distortion is real and fools a lot of apes.
2021-04-26 21:22:03,wallstreetbets,Probably gonna touch 280 levels.
2021-04-26 23:10:34,wallstreetbets,Well I thought it was going to dip lower than $150

2021-04-26 22:49:08,wallstreetbets,That's the impression I have.  When I checked mine with Scotia it says CLASS A SHARES (from what I read that includes voting rights?)

2021-04-27 00:17:33,wallstreetbets,Only full shares can get transferred during an account transfer. If you do a partial account transfer then the partial shares stay in the account.  If you do a full account transfer they close out your partial shares and transfer the cash.
2021-04-27 14:56:47,wallstreetbets,"Ahh, interesting! Hope it works out for the best"
2021-04-26 20:12:42,wallstreetbets,I wish I could make a 15yr mortgage payment! Lol

2021-04-27 14:31:10,wallstreetbets,I think you need to take a look at how a log scale works. This graph has clearly logarithmic y axis ... And since it's a straight line that he drew on a log graph it would mean that the trend line would be a parabola in a fixed graph. Which means the price is following exponential growth.
2021-04-27 01:11:42,wallstreetbets,I was here
2021-04-26 21:29:31,wallstreetbets,Same on the cash front. And Webull GME Shares are delayed for some reason. But I called and the dude said it’s normal. Sounded like a 25 year old stoned dude but whatever haha

2021-04-26 20:24:51,wallstreetbets,This is the way 🦍
2021-04-26 20:37:29,wallstreetbets,Sage advice. Many do not understand this.
2021-04-26 20:40:15,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, that safety of knowing if needed you have the $ to pay that shit off is just as good of a feeling."
2021-04-26 20:40:42,wallstreetbets,Do you know how good it feels to not have a mortgage? Sure it makes sense to play the numbers spread on paper. But do you know how good it feels to not have a mortgage?
2021-04-26 21:03:04,wallstreetbets,An investment like.....gme??
2021-04-26 21:04:55,wallstreetbets,"The deal is .... honestly. You make different life choices, Better one’s in my opinion, when you pay off your home. Really don’t like your job, unless you’re behind on taxes or something, fuck that job. Having a secure place that really is yours is better fuck you money than just about any other investment, unless of course your net worth is 5x+ what your house is worth."
2021-04-26 21:18:05,wallstreetbets,Houses are an investment. And they steadily gain value over time. I wouldn’t buy one right now but if you bought one two years ago and could all the sudden pay it off in a lump sum that would be the smartest way to spend the money. But I’m a smooth brained ape so I have no fucking clue really.
2021-04-26 21:51:15,wallstreetbets,"Not having a mortgage payment and that security and comfort is kind of like, the whole point of investing isn't it? Like if your investments pay off you get to be comfortably retired without worry about bills and things. So why would you wait to pay off the mortgage when you could just pay it off and then have that comfort early?"

2021-04-26 22:01:00,wallstreetbets,This is solid advice. We don't normally give that on WSB
2021-04-26 22:05:06,wallstreetbets,"I like to think about cash on cash return. If your mortgage is $300k and your payment is $2k/mo, paying it off will leave a positive $2000 cash flow in your account every month. That is an 8% return on your $300k. Hard to beat!"
2021-04-26 22:19:38,wallstreetbets,This guy does math. Hats off to you sir!
2021-04-26 22:21:34,wallstreetbets,What about putting the money you aren't using on your nonexistent mortgage into....IDK a few GME shares a month??💎👐🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-26 22:39:12,wallstreetbets,Long term fixed low rate debt is a money maker during inflationary periods.
2021-04-26 22:59:18,wallstreetbets,30 year amortized. Weigh this against the probability that stonks gonna tank. I have no crystal ball but debt free is a huge relief.
2021-04-26 23:26:13,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't any money spent paying off the house essentially an investment in the house itself, assuming it will continue to appreciate.  So, if you anticipate the housing market to improve faster than inflation and/or an index fund, it would make sense to out money there.  Additionally, you're no longer paying interest on that money, furthering the relative gain.

Either way, even if it's slower, you're still getting some growth out of that money in addition to the peace of mind of being done paying it off."
2021-04-26 23:35:38,wallstreetbets,"People arn't robots, that is great advise for a robot with no emotional connection or stress related to secure housing."
2021-04-26 23:43:33,wallstreetbets,*not financial advice
2021-04-26 23:47:29,wallstreetbets,"So I put some thought into the pay off or not situation.   
   
I know this is slightly off topic but since the conversation led into it I may as well ask. In this persons situation wouldn’t it be best to pay it off and take the monthly payment payment that they had already planned on paying for the next 30 years and paying that into the S&P or a Roth each month? The benefit I see here is the house is paid off and you are immediately building wealth with interest instead of paying interest. What would those numbers calculate out to on let’s say a 100k mortgage at 4% APR vs making that monthly payment to the S&P paying about 5-6%? Or how about only paying the exact 100,000/360 since you don’t need to pay interest because the market would be paying you interest?"

I sound like Dave Ramsey on this one thing lol.

2021-04-26 20:14:27,wallstreetbets,The house is going to appreciate in value whether it's paid off or not...
2021-04-26 22:30:10,wallstreetbets,"It's easier to make money when you have money so I would rather use the capital to further advantage. Now if you've already hit the point where you have fuck you money then sure pay off the mortgage, but if I'm sitting at 2-3x my mortgage value in my account I'm going to take advantage of having a large amount of money loaned to me at a very favorable interest rate and invest it so I can hit the fuck you money plateau."
2021-04-26 22:24:27,wallstreetbets,300k worth of UTG at 34.53 pays $1563.86 a month in dividends and you get to keep your entire principal. I'd be ok paying the $437.14 a month out of pocket and hanging on to a bunch of shares of a stable stock that even if it does not appreciate will net me more than my mortgage interest over the duration of my mortgage.
2021-04-26 22:36:57,wallstreetbets,Also you're not factoring in that a decent chunk of the $2k is going towards your escrow and you're going to wind up paying that whether your house is paid off or not.  For a payment around $2k a month a little over $550 of that is going to be going towards your taxes and insurance so in reality you'd have a positive cash flow of $1450 going into your account monthly.
2021-04-26 23:45:34,wallstreetbets,"Not really, the house will appreciate in value whether you've paid it off or not.  It's basically paying off a low interest loan early which doesn't make a ton of sense if you believe you can earn more than the interest rate in another way.  You're not getting any growth out of the money at all you're just avoiding paying interest."
2021-04-26 23:54:35,wallstreetbets,$100k at 3% (closer to the current rate)  would be about $422 worth of principal and interest a month in payments for 30 years.  $100k invested in UTG (since I've used this example a few times already and it's an easy one since it's a monthly dividend) would pay you $521.28 assuming you take the direct payout and never set it up to DRIP and then at the end of 30 years you receive the equivalent of a balloon payment as your original principal is still there invested and you're still getting paid that dividend.
2021-04-27 00:31:37,wallstreetbets,"Over the course of 30 years with $265k invested at a rate of return of 4%, even non-compounded, you make almost double that 160k."
2021-04-27 03:03:41,wallstreetbets,That would be an even bigger reason to not pay the house off.  Short term declines on dividend aristocrat type stocks mean you would be getting an even better deal and generating even more income over a 30 year period.
2021-04-27 17:07:34,wallstreetbets,It's not the same thing though as the rate for a HELOC is nearly double the rate for a regular mortgage currently.  There's a huge difference between borrowing at 3% and borrowing at 5.6%.

2021-04-26 23:56:57,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, I guess thinking about it... you took the loan out for a specific dollar amount.  It doesn't change as the house value changes.  Yup. I'm an idiot sometimes, it's ok.  I was thinking of it as like a relative ownership - as you paid off the loan you own a progressively larger portion of the property... Which is simply not the case.

Thanks for bringing me back to reality.  Clearly I've never bought/owned property.  Still renting.  Hopefully in 5ish years I'll be in the market to purchase something/take a mortgage :)"
2021-04-27 01:23:51,wallstreetbets,"I understand what you are saying about leveraging your credit & you have a point.

My point is that if you are paying your mortgage off with a big windfall, your bills are reduced dramatically. You can take the cash you aren't spending on a dwelling & buy more of whatever modestly-yielding security you choose.

I'm pretty tired right now but I would put money on compounding interest beating a non-compounding rate of return anywhere near the same %. On paper, compound interest sounds like some gangster shit. You pay mostly interest up front."
2021-04-26 21:34:08,wallstreetbets,"My mom comes from a family of 5 siblings, and they all went and had a couple kids, and we've been close since forever.

2021-04-26 20:46:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah hard to quantify the massive risk reduction having your home paid off represents

2021-04-26 21:50:39,wallstreetbets,Yeah but then the sad reality of your monthly payments basically only drops in half because taxes and insurance in a hcol area. Still fuck it id do it just to pay it off too for relief and just to be like the only person I know with a paid off house lmao

2021-04-27 00:25:15,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget all the interest you can write off on your taxes you would be missing out on PLUS the tax on the capital gains... it’s a lose lose in my opinion to do it that way. You would be smart to keep investing in safe investments

2021-04-26 21:21:49,wallstreetbets,I paid around $4k closing costs. I had offers for less but I opted to buy some points for a lower rate. The trick is finding a broker who is upfront and honest about all your options and fees.

2021-04-27 00:12:29,wallstreetbets,If you have the ability to do so put in as much OT as you can to put yourself in position to buy a house ASAP as it's the easiest way to grow wealth.  I worked about 75 hours a week for an extended period of time doing a job I fucking hated and was vastly underpaid at (call center) to save up enough money to buy my first house.  Five years later I was able to sell it for about 160% of my purchase price and was able to buy a nicer home that hopefully I'll be able to sell in a few years for 120-130% of what I paid.  You can also check to see what type of programs your state has as many states have programs to help first time home buyers with things like down payment assistance so you may be able to recoup some of the tax money you've paid in over your lifetime.

2021-04-27 11:00:30,wallstreetbets,"You’re correct, you would save interest on the mortgage. Sometimes you pay a penalty for early repayment but not all loans. To me it’s about reframing how you see a home as an asset that can be used to create stability and not just as another investment to generate % gains. It’s a matter of perspective really. You can do all kind of math showing how you miss out by paying off a mortgage but there is no where to input happiness, stability for families and the sense of ease it provides."
2021-04-27 00:45:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah to me it’s not because even if I was reducing my income slightly by writing off mortgage related expenses it wouldn’t make up for it. Also as you get closer to the end of your mortgage the benefits decrease as your paying more principal so less interest to write off at the tail end. If you’re working and you pay off a $2k/month mortgage you have money to invest, travel whatever. 

I’ve been investing my whole life and never stopped to pay off my mortgage is what I mean. It’s not an either/or situation.

When you say capital gains are you referring to selling your home & paying capital gains? Just paying it off shouldn’t generate any taxes and if you live in it for a certain number of years before selling you wouldn’t pay capital gains that I’m aware of. 

There are circumstances where it may not be appropriate to pay off a mortgage but in my specific situation there is no downside that would change my calculation."

2021-04-27 07:47:25,wallstreetbets,"I did but that’s why I’m questioning it.  The rate drop will have less impact on your payment than going from a 30 yr fixed to a 15 ur fixed, which results in a much higher principle payment, which is also at odds with the original advice of keeping your cash liquid for investments and not front loading it all into a home. That’s why I asked."
2021-04-26 21:37:10,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the reply! I had a similar thought, that I’d need to find a broker who was up front about the costs, and I’d much rather pay up front than have it rolled into my mortgage payments and accrue interest."
2021-04-26 20:44:50,wallstreetbets,"Because there's something about not owing a large mortgage. It will enable a higher quality of life with less stress if you don't have to worry about that payment. Also opens the door to do whatever the hell you want, as opposed to a job you may hate"

2021-04-26 22:37:53,wallstreetbets,that is a nice sentiment!  I like it a lot!   pay it off and no matter what your payment after some horrible event still nothing!

2021-04-27 00:21:02,wallstreetbets,I just wish we didn’t have property taxes after mortgage is paid off. I am not talking about all kinds of taxes. Just property taxes.
2021-04-26 20:07:57,wallstreetbets,This is what I was looking for when I saw the two preceding comments. It was highly inappropriate. Thank you.
2021-04-27 04:50:41,wallstreetbets,"I hate when you mentally Czech out and miss an opportunity, but try to be Praguematic about it and think it just wasn’t meant to be.

2021-04-27 05:19:47,wallstreetbets,"Well TBH (not to ruin your self-esteem, I am talking in general about girls here) if she was into you she would most likely tell you/approach you unless you were keeping your distance. Czech girls are kinda upfront about their feelings if they think they are mutual and do not play hard to get (most of them most of the time)."
2021-04-27 05:17:20,wallstreetbets,Nah we had that... Sucked.
2021-04-26 20:09:17,wallstreetbets,Not bad
2021-04-26 21:08:16,wallstreetbets,"What enables a higher quality of life and opens the door to doing whatever the hell you want is having enough passive income to cover your basic needs. If you had  60k dollars in student loan debt at 4%, 200k in mortgage debt at 2.5%, and a 10k car loan at 6%, obviously you would pay back the car loan first, followed by the student loan debt, and then the mortgage. You just need to expand that thinking a little bit more. If you can buy stock that will grow 3% per year and pay a 2% dividend, that's better than making an extra mortgage payment. It's a little better than paying off the 4% loan, but I think I'd agree with you that it's safer to pay off the debt in that case. The car, on the other hand, costs more than you can reasonably expect as an average investment return, so absolutely, pay it off immediately. Same goes for your credit card, never carry a balance on that shit. But the US government subsidizes the ever living crap out of mortgage debt and if you're not taking advantage, you're missing out."
2021-04-26 20:20:17,wallstreetbets,You do realize most variable rate mortgages can be converted to a fixed rate at any time right?
2021-04-27 01:30:03,wallstreetbets,"Your best bet would probably be to move, but I don't know your situation so maybe it's not feasible for non-financial reasons.  Thankfully my personal preference is to live away from other people so my cost of living is a lot lower than it would be if I chose to move about 30 miles North into a metro area. If you don't have any family/friend roots tying you to the area you're in you could probably take a lower salary and wind up coming out with more money saved by moving away from whichever major city you're near."

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$GME Technical Analysis: Waves go Brrr Hi Fam, its me, Fam. 

There is something going on with GME and it may be  **imminent**
This is my interpretation of GME thru wave counting/elliotwave. 

Refer to this image first : https://i.imgur.com/CR0OiQJ.jpg

From a yearly point of view, we have accomplished wave 1(A) and wave 2(B) colored blue for those colored blind (idk how that works). We are in the mist of forming wave C.  That will be interpreted in the following paragraph. From this standpoint, we have strong support level at 23.6 fib level (priced 142.79). It was actually broken, but that level was a *test* to see how far it will go down. It found support again (twice) on several different locations (weeks later) This is very important because the psychology of the market (investors) show a threshold and now pointing towards a bullish movement - even though we were consolidating. Now, per elliot wave analysis, Wave 3 is the **BIGGEST** wave of the 5 wave formation. It  must past the high of 488.51 in order to be called a elliot wave 3 or C wave. There are several *mini* resistance levels we must past but as I am typing, we pushed past two of them. The next important level of all is Price $200 which is surprisingly at fib level 38.2. Thats a magic number for later. We can *predict where Wave 3 may end* and that number is 504 .34- 531.72. (math not included) 

Refer to image: https://i.imgur.com/cw86Lhx.jpg
This image basically tells me half time is over and the bell just rung. The pendant is forming or has already formed.  Its a signal and confirms the psychoanalysis of market (retail investors and all) that there is a upward movement. However, there needs to be a stimulus or break out movement out. This image now focuses on our micro analysis of wave 3 (C). Wave 1 of wave C has completed and assumingly so, wave 2 (b) of bigger wave 3 is consolidating (pendant). Quick fib analysis: We find resistance at fib level 23.6 (priced at 169.26). Then again we have fib level 38.2 hovering around price 200 (remember this - important later down the road). If we want some kind of breakout, we need to close above 200, followed by some stimulus (upward movement factor). In addition, this pendant formed a higher lows but also lower highs (consolidation). 

On the daily,
* if we close above 169-170, thats a great start
* Then close above 200, price movement is building momentum for wave C - which should have the biggest momentum of all 5 waves
* Theoretically, it needs to close above 351.90 to confirm wave 3(C), but remember thats only the smaller version of Wave 3. 

If this happens, it can theoretically push bigger wave 5 to around 800 (depends on market volatility and demand) to XXXXs. 

 TLDR: Wave 3's forming. There is a pressure on GME market and it may be bullish movement from now on. Consolidation may be done if it can close above micro support levels. 

Im not a financially literate to be a financial advisor, but just shooting blanks, i think. My mom told me I lost a chromosome when she was dividing me during meiosis (not mitosis per SFWsosa93)  phase.

EDIT: LOOK AT IT GO! ITS literally erection time.  (40 mins past close)"

On another note, i think you could make good use of the 3 point fib extension [in here](https://prnt.sc/124n838) and focus on the .618, 1 and 1.618 levels for possible subwave 3 targets. Lets hope that it's truly a wave 3 and not a WXY formation!

It's been a few years since i hadn't looked at a chart, at the time i studied a lot of theories and strategies including elliot waves, and while i couldn't get past the psychological barrier, the TA aspect of it still holds a special place in my heart, so thank you for your post :). Hope your prediction is/was right!"
2021-04-27 02:26:05,wallstreetbets,"from 488 to lowest point before march that's A, the. 3 waves up meaning that the wave B is complete and now its forming wave C that will neccesarely do 5 waves, following the theory of elliott waves, if it does 3-3-3 its more complex or double ABC, forming an WXY. GME has a long way to go, it's not his moment yet."

Price remained range bound between about $135-149 for the next two days. Then on 04/14 they dropped the last remaining shares during the first hour. After that, we were off to the races, never falling below the range high.

Or let it ride out, i dont think at those prices they would exercise, but i woukd also like to cash in in my shares, but have only been doing options since january and have only sold a few calls and usually buy em back when i can take profit on doing so.

For some reason, I can't get the basics of calls & puts straight. I don't know if I wanna Buy/Sell to open or Sell/Buy to close.  Which does what with which option.

From what I understand, a covered call is using owned shares to sell a right to buy.  If you sold a $400c and price goes over $400 before 19Nov, someone is gonna come knockin' to take your shares.  You want to ditch that contract. As price goes higher your bleeding.

But, PLEASE, definite get a second opinion from someone far more knowledgeable and wiser.  That's just a guess from someone completely unqualified, with limited knowledge, and a woefully inadequate understanding."

If they decide to buy the COVAXIN from OCUGEN, we will see the likes of another GME born before our eyes.

You can read this vaccine all over mainstream media, the news, and what's most important is in India, they may be on the verge to accept this vaccine for distribution because of the huge amount of cases of COVID still ongoing rampaging their country.

 President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India outlined how the two countries can cooperate and work together to fight this pandemic. The main thing was that Prime Minister Modi is very excited to start the emergency distribution of COVAXIN which has 100% efficacy compared to the ones currently being used in India. 

[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/26/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call-with-prime-minister-narendra-modi-of-india-2/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/26/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call-with-prime-minister-narendra-modi-of-india-2/)

This is all very very very exciting news for holders of OCGN, and look at the asking price. It's fairly low for a company who may be the next Pfizer, Moderna, JJ. The stock rose 20% today but that is still a far too low price point for what I expect for this stock. GME rose easily 50% a day ongoing for many days.

2021-04-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Aphria/Tilray merger.... After reading through several articles about these two companies merging over past few months; that said it doesn’t seem much has changed in the actual distribution of shares. 

My question is in regards to stock price (an Aphria shareholder will receive .8381 of Tilray shares per each share of Aphria).  That said, I’m sure I’m wrong, but if you owned 1000 shares of APHA @($14+/-) you would now get 838 shares of Tilray @ ($17+/-) replacing 1000 shares. Is there a benefit (or not too much of one) to be on one side or the other as it seems like that’s kinda baked in price already as they mirror each other in movements. Ex. Right now Tilray is 17.85, Aphria is at 14.70. If you take .8381 of Tilray, it makes Aphria at a price it should be of 14.96. 
Am I understanding this correctly? the two will most likely be priced to be almost equal at time of merger. Thank you, appreciate....just trying to see which side to stay on as I keep moving, or hold both. (My long cannabis position)"

2021-04-26 20:11:58,wallstreetbets,"This company has had rumors of acquisition for years.  Company has been around since the early 90's.  If they had something valuable, an acquisition would have happened a long time ago (or at least they would be able to make money from it).  Unlike GME, which is a company that has actual revenue and just fell on hard times, this company has had nothing for years.  This one will end in real heartbreak.

Rewind to last summer and all the talk about this company was about its AR?VR module that is used in the hololense 2.  Oct. 2020 conference call SS all but admits that it is going to be very hard for any company other than microsoft to buy this tech and build AR/Vr around it because it was designed specific for MSFT's module and SS pivots from talking about AR/VR to this new lidar they have been working on basically out of nowhere.  Funny thing is, if any company was going to buy MVIS they would have done so last year with it was trading at $1.  No company is going to pay what the current valuation is.  This will end in tears."

2021-04-27 13:50:49,wallstreetbets,"No doubt that guy knows his stuff but what I think a lot of folks here on this sub are not aware of is that people don't buy games direct from retailers very much anymore. Video game publishers were smart and saw gamestop was fading and places like amazon were becoming king so they poured money into their own ecomm platforms. Steam, gamepass, bethesda store, Ubisoft,etc, etc. They're all bypassing the middleman because that's the direction the industry was moving. 

I'm genuinely not sure what RC can do to circumvent that. It's a huge problem though."
2021-04-27 14:29:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s what lurking is lol

2021-04-27 09:37:41,wallstreetbets,">> GME Implied Volatility Update - Trend is Lower

Thanks for sharing. Key words here

* **vol·a·til·i·ty**   (noun) liability to change rapidly and unpredictably, especially for the worse.

* **Lower** implied in the statement above!"
2021-04-26 23:04:59,wallstreetbets,Mods are actually gay that’s why
2021-04-27 01:12:15,wallstreetbets,They’re gonna be forced to put it back if this thing keeps going up
2021-04-26 20:03:26,wallstreetbets,Lower Volume makes it easier to manipulate.
2021-04-27 08:09:40,wallstreetbets,Mods are gay
2021-04-26 22:18:37,wallstreetbets,"mixed with Qanon

I'm sorry but i'm earish on Super Stonk. Some people need to get a grip over there. i buy, I hold, that's all I truly know."
2021-04-26 21:54:05,wallstreetbets,"If they want my 105 shares they'll have to pry them from my soft, well moisturized office worker hands."
2021-04-26 20:01:47,wallstreetbets,"Thats not completely true. Yes, the relatively flat movement in the stock led to a lower IV.  However, a Lower IV results in cheaper Out of the Money option contracts.  The Lower IV (cheap options) can be the driving factor to people starting to speculate again on OTM options.  More speculation can drive the price up.  More option buying b/c of cheap options prices has an affect on the stock prie b/c of the delta hedging which has been covered alot on this message board.  Lower IV has many meanings, it's what the market decides to do with it.  The IV number can be the cause of why people start speculating again which leads to big moves."
2021-04-27 00:34:57,wallstreetbets,Could this be a set up for a gamma squeeze?  Seems like the long 🐳 could knock out the shorts.
2021-04-27 03:31:17,wallstreetbets,easier to manipulate a price that still won't free up the shares desperately needed. So who gives a shit?
2021-04-27 01:59:17,wallstreetbets,Shitadel
2021-04-27 06:13:30,wallstreetbets,You can’t discuss live price action and argue with bears in those places no one wants an echo chamber
2021-04-27 01:06:20,wallstreetbets,And that’s something they’d agree on. 👍🏼
2021-04-27 06:15:36,wallstreetbets,Lmaoo people all talking about one stock is nothing like q hell nah
2021-04-26 20:58:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it just sometimes sounds like people talk about IV like it's a mysterious number that gets assigned to a stock like magic, rather than the result of how the stock is trading."
2021-04-27 00:35:49,wallstreetbets,Are you watching for a gamma squeeze set up?  Is this possible? Likely?
2021-04-27 01:35:21,wallstreetbets,"High IV = the bid-ask spread is wider, that's it - meaning people can't agree on a price.  If there's a big price disagreement, usually a lot of people are wrong about it.  So it can move either way"
2021-04-27 07:16:15,wallstreetbets,The same echo chamber effect happens here. Notice how I didnt say anything negative or false yet I’m still being downvoted. Same thing happened on daily threads every single day.
2021-04-27 18:52:47,wallstreetbets,"just like anything, it's one data point.  nothing mysterious.  it's more important to people who trade in options.  for example, I look at fundamentals for most stocks I own.  If a stock I like drops alot (20%+) and the IV is low I'd be willing to buy some options rather than shares.  At the end of the day, it means something to some people and to others it doesn't matter.  It's just how you invest.  no right or wrong here."
2021-04-27 18:50:07,wallstreetbets,Just a guess but not likely near term.  The short interest seems low which was one of the factors.  The stock is much higher now vs the first and 2nd squeeze.
2021-04-26 20:07:06,wallstreetbets,wtf why so many people downvote you XD
2021-04-26 20:53:19,wallstreetbets,"Can’t stop, won’t stop, Gametstop!"
2021-04-27 18:54:02,wallstreetbets,"Ok, thanks!  It was my understanding that the gamma was driven mainly by close OTM call options that went ITM.  Last I looked there’s a lot more option activity lining up in May.  My thought is another gamma could be triggered by more positive news plus a lot of buying that pushes a huge bunch of OTM calls ITM.  I’m not an options expert so just throwing this out there hoping someone is watching options chains."

If you have a little bit of cash to throw to actually see some decent gains. Like I said I put in $1,000 but have made $1,400"

Shopping for lingerie is an awkward experience I’d imagine, so if they end up perfecting that with their new business direction they could be huge.

2021-04-26 23:26:25,wallstreetbets,If you have a treatment for a niche disease/medical condition that no other company has you can charge what you want with no competition. One drug manufacturer charges $700+ for one of their pills.  Just let that sink in. These guys have the 3 top floors in a multi story building so the can put their name on top of the building just to troll a rival drug maker who’s name is on a smaller building across the street....and  2 floors are unoccupied for the past 2 years. I’d say there is plenty of profit.
2021-04-26 21:32:09,wallstreetbets,Me too please

2021-04-26 20:40:09,wallstreetbets,So is there no way to get advice from analysts at barclay without dropping 500k. When’s someone going to release those reports here ? Haha
2021-04-26 22:42:49,wallstreetbets,Excellent DD thank you for sharing. I’m interested in the amount of money needs to be invested to afford only the Barclays recommendations.
2021-04-27 00:18:54,wallstreetbets,"Well done. So best returns within the scope of your study is buying sell recommendations, and selling 1 quarter after. I like it. Care to share the excel?"
2021-04-27 02:33:45,wallstreetbets,Here is my analysis THIS SHIT IS ALL RIGGED for big money to win all the time. EXCEPT NOW THEY ARE FUCKED
2021-04-27 03:24:25,wallstreetbets,Curious to hear what you did with multiple recommendations for the same stock. I.e. Barclay says sell and Morgan says buy for the same stock in the same period. You can't simultaneously buy and sell the stock at the same time.
2021-04-27 05:58:19,wallstreetbets,So we should HODL ?
2021-04-27 17:43:06,wallstreetbets,So I should buy more UWMC? Cause Barclays said so.

2021-04-27 03:29:13,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, perhaps sometimes but on average I don't think so. So, with 'Buy' recommendations, there is only significant price changes if it involves a change in sentiment - e.g. 'Sell' -> 'Buy'. If it's just a reiteration with a new PT there's less significant reaction. It also depends on the number of analysts covering the stock."

2021-04-26 20:11:34,wallstreetbets,"I have 2 accounts, your prototypical boomer account managed by proper fidouchies and then my personal monkey gambling TD Ameritrade account.
Like a true ‘tard , I look for lottery tickets. 

Now with Biden and the new green deal, I thought trucking is way overdue some attention for actual change. My sights were both on Nikola and Hyliion.
I was stupidly way hotter for Nikola and then that short seller Hindenburg loaded up their shorts and publicized a blistering report that crushed them. I was shocked to learn this is legal and not a form of insider trading. As furious as I was with Hindenburg , their report was however right and Nikola is just a POS sci-fi b movie. Hyliion on the other hand is more than a paper dream. They have live functioning product(s) transitional hybrid and full on EV. 

My concerns with them remain 

A) are they truly 30% more efficient? Where is the empirical data? The report(s)? Signed off by who?

B) what’s a bare minimum network for fueling stations? With 500/600 mile ranges , that doesn’t mean you can get by with stations 500 miles apart. They probably need to be max 100 miles to be viable.

C) damage/warranty - who warranties any damage to the engine this new attachment gets blamed for? Does it just void a truck’s warranty outright. 
( though with the amount of solicitation calls we all get on our cell phones for 3rd party car warranties, I’m sure it’s not a stretch to find companies to do this for Hyliion  upgrades)

Point B can be quite problematic, I did come up with an idea to get the ball rolling. I was thinking about NYC. Our buses have been running on natural gas for a long time. There is a good quantity of buses so it warrants spending on proper filling stations within such a small area of mileage.

So instead of starting with the cross country trucker, why not start with the pier container trucking? Set up stations and Hyliion trucks with all the ocean pier trucking. 95% plus of all container moves from the pier are less than 100 miles. Start on both coasts and build filling stations towards the middle of the country."

They cut their teeth going door to door selling religion as teenagers, imagine what they could do with a useful product. They are relentless.  When they get into your business it is very difficult to justify getting out.

The service team is top notch. They are very professional and when you are using the service you can trust the service team not to upsell you and only do the work you asked them to do. They leave the upselling to others, who do a crazy job at it.

Hopefully my lessons are being learned for when I’m ready to jump in with all of my stacked up tiny profits.

2021-04-27 03:13:31,wallstreetbets,Yeah I heard the Thursday earnings report will not be favorable but just learnded about the potential BO. I have buddies shorting it left and right because of the anticipation that the earnings won't help.

2021-04-26 21:42:28,wallstreetbets,"Investment accountant at one of the top commercial real estate firms checking in - I concur with the author's sentiment.

What's worse and not being called out here - There are vast sums of uncollected rents - I mean vast - and those rents have been, and are still being recorded as revenue throughout the pandemic. We make an offset to a contra asset account for the ""payment deferral agreements"" which the landlords hope to collect some day. (Sorry to say, but it's on the order of $MMM and those collections aren't going to happen). Until those collections are written off, you're not going to see the cataclysmic reduction in revenues OR the reduction in property values (i.e. commercial property valuation is based entirely off the rents a property can generate)

What could be added here that'd makes the situation worse you ask? The transition to remote working that most companies are now allowing. This has added gasoline to the fire shitstorm, as tenants aren't renewing leases and finding companies to sign on to new leases has become impossible. New York and California are the absolute worst - Texas is actually doing fine because of slowly becoming Silicon Valley 2.0

You were uncertain how to determine timing - Watch the commercial real estate market for property sales. When you see the uptick, you know its getting close.

Have fun bears."

2021-04-27 08:07:44,wallstreetbets,"Some people in the comments have speculated that a CMBS crash could crash the rest of the system, but I'm not certain. We're talking about a \~$500B market, as compared to the \~8T housing market that caused the '08 crash. So, **as long as the damage is contained within the CMBS market**, I don't see a systemic pull back. 

Now, if there is a broader crash of the entire commercial RE market, as speculated by /u/ShadyDave_Naked in another comment, there could be real issues. The entire CRE market is probably somewhere between $15-20T today. Still smaller than today's residential RE market at \~$35T, but definitely big enough to cause a complete meltdown if what he says is true. 

AFAIK, UWMC and RKT are not involved in CRE, only RRE. 

DG Puts may also be a good play. That's probably going to be my next DD piece, but I haven't had time to get started on it. YMMV. Also, note that DG isn't the at-fault actor here. It's highly unlikely they are overstating their NOI. The culpable actor here is Ladder. $LADR is the one ""cooking the books"" at the time they package the loans into a CMBS, not DG. That said, DG has other issues. Stay tuned..."

AWS partners are companies heavily reliant on AWS for their infrastructure and cloud environment. It has nothing to do with partnerships where both companies work on a product together by pooling engineering and man hour resources."

2021-04-27 00:32:49,wallstreetbets,"I’ve worked on 50/50 plays before with AWS & Azure over the years. They aren’t rare.

I’ve worked on ones where aws paid for everything including our salaries and rent.

Just remember who the big fish in the partnership is...one of these companies is putting everything they’ve got into this thing, the other will swap them out with zero pain if it isn’t going well...kinda like how Ford dumped them for infotainment.

TBH my biggest concern would be expecting BB to supply enough quality engineers to make the partnership successful.

They’ve been leaking talent for a decade.

To each their own, but coming from that industry and working in parallel with many people in those companies and watching the decline of BB (and to some degree QNX since acquisition) from the front row, I’m just trying to give a counter point to this glossy sales article masquerading as DD so that people don’t go broke on it.

Note: I do not have a position. As you can guess I have no interest in buying stocks in it, but I also don’t trust it to fall at a predictable rate so I’m not confident to short it. I personally believe that as they sell off assets and consolidate their focus they’ll slowly down tick closer to 5$, at which point id be curious to reevaluate their future. I think perfect world for me would be for them to gain some traction then get taken over/bought out, and be in low enough to see a nice return."
2021-04-27 04:17:36,wallstreetbets,"For a start, that's **not what AWS partners are**. You're describing partners as customers - AWS Partners use AWS solutions and consulting to create solutions. That's what BB is doing.

Secondly - you are aware that the IVY partnership isn't just about developing together? BB will be heavily reliant on AWS infrastructure because BB isn't a cloud provider and does not have the resources to build a private cloud, unless it wants to choke the amount of customers it can onboard. And lets be honest, the talent at AWS for ML/AI and Big Data analytics is going to far exceed BB, its a partnership where BB is **heavily reliant** on AWS.

Do some research instead of just blindly telling yourself that you'll lift those bags."
2021-04-27 08:58:05,wallstreetbets,"Do you think any of these competitors will have the same security capabilities as BB though? There will no doubt be competition but this market for data will be so big that there is space for all of them to thrive. Unless IVY is abandoned and they execute, I can't see how this will be bad for BB revenue."
2021-04-27 12:33:05,wallstreetbets,"You don't need to have them say it, the changes that have been made in the backroom and the front are more than enough signs. You wouldn't know because you're not invested and can't distinguish FUD and shitty propaganda vs. facts.

They just cleared all debt and sitting on $551 million cash. More than enough to start a dominating transformation in its market.

2021-04-27 08:45:24,wallstreetbets,"""Do some research""

IVY is cloud agnostic and doesnt have to run on AWS. This is common knowledge that youd know, if you did your research :)

Sounds like you have 0 idea what IVY is and AWS involvement in it."
2021-04-27 09:22:56,wallstreetbets,"I don't really see the security benefits of IVY. The endpoints would be protected by whatever UES is chosen by the automotive company, and the cloud would be protected by whatever cloud security provider is chosen by the automotive company, the operating system again will be as secure as whatever OS they decide to use. 

Sure a hacker could try to attack whatever vehicle data platform API is chosen (lets say IVY) but then all they're going to be able to access is the vehicle data. Data breaches aren't great but I think most companies realise that data breaches aren't really cared about by most consumers. How many people have actually stopped using FB products because FB has countless data breaches?

I've not heard of anyone hacking Tesla's vehicle data platform, but in all fairness it's fairly early days for that. I think more people are worried about hacks on endpoints that might make them break suddenly, crash the car  or let someone steal it - which IVY won't be involved with. 

Additionally - do we have any actual info on the security of IVY? It's safe to assume it'll be a safe product because BB isn't a company that takes security lightly. But until there's actually specs to compare it to current competitors, who's to say what vehicle data platform will be the most secure?

I don't deny IVY will likely be a successful product for BB, definitely going to be a serious revenue driver. But saying that there is no competitor is just a lie. And I don't think the revenue will be enough to 40x the share price in 5 years - don't forget IVY only actually physically ships in cars to collect data in 2023."

But TBH everyone I know left despite the 100% retentions, $$$ bonuses and half work at Apple right now on a competing platform (aka dwarfing qnx)...who also gives 100% retention but isn’t crashing...all the under performers were moved to Ford 

I’m honestly not here to stir shit - just trying to provide an industry front lines counter point to these really glossy BB DD posts.

I’m legitimately worried about ppl yoloing this company.

Again, I have no position on it. So to each their own."
2021-04-27 07:21:29,wallstreetbets,"Lol it’s such low hanging fruit that they do it with big four consultancies. Check out aws + Deloitte hahahaha I did it will Cisco and ciena and Deloitte and have watched it happen in a dozen other places (I can’t name the projects due to NDA so if that isn’t enough then so be it I can’t say more) ...also partnered with Microsoft to develop a private cloud azure back in 2017, don’t worry about what it’s called, it doesn’t exist anymore....not that Microsoft cares (sale was 280M dollars but still it is dead lol - guaranteed the provider made their nut and we got laid off)

I’m a software eng by trade and also spent a decent amount of time in consulting - active in the business for over 20y, much of that out of Ottawa - aka silicon north, where these guys live.

I’m saying one is betting on this partnership, the other is allowing it to happen.  If you don’t understand the underlying software and hardware then you don’t understand how this is a generic play for aws and an all eggs in one basket play for BB.

TBH if you want to eat up this glossy magazine level DD then knock yourself out.

I’m legitimately just trying to help the group with a counterpoint.  I lived thru Nortel, BB is a slower but definitely failing equivalent...best case they drop to 4-5$ and get bought out. They’ve acted like dinosaurs for over a decade and Chen has proven himself a dinosaur too...only ppl that make money off BB are BB execs. Pigs to the trough while they wait for it to fail.

Ultimately up to you, but BB market share counting on a strip mined QNX (Apple took their talent incl their founder lol) and selling patents (one time OU short term gain) is not a 20$ stock.  They’re a 5$ stock until they actually do something.

Best of luck - legit not trying to stir shit. Just passionate about my position as I am so close to it and don’t want to see WSB ppl lose money."

2021-04-26 21:40:20,wallstreetbets,"I feel like this is why the stock has not jumped on all this supposed good news so far. BB is selling off revenue streams and appears to be focusing on things like QNX and IVY, the former not currently generating a tonne of cash and the latter a bit of a mystery as far as revenue models are concerned. In my mind this is why BB is in a bit of a weird transitional phase, almost like a mini-pivot beyond its original turnaround into cybersecurity/software. Could be a big payoff in future but still a bit speculative at this stage."
2021-04-27 09:00:17,wallstreetbets,"What? IVY is cloud agnostic, so again it's not ""heavily reliant on AWS infrastructure because BB isn't a cloud provider.""

I don't see cybersecurity and automobile operating system being as in demand as gaming. And BB could easily have competition. Why wouldn't car manufacturers make their own OS sometime soon? Sure they might use BB now but it can be replaced, that's the magic of tech - much higher rate of change and a company can easily be outpaced."

The short interest its really high now because of the merger, but from what I can remember Huya has always been a higher short interest stock compared to other chinese stocks despite them being better positioned than most. I've been in this stock for about 2 years now and the volatility that this stock goes through is insane despite their business being rock solid and they are the leader in a massively growing market.

I'm also expecting this merger to go through and hopefully after it happens we can see this stock reach new levels and not dump all the gains every time like it has done since being listed. Huya did a double up and dumped it all back to pandemic levels while Bilibili basically did a 10x. Although their businesses are not 100% similar, there's still a lot of overlap between them that you can make comparisons between them. At one point Bili was only about 1 billion market cap over Huya and now it's 10x, all in under 2 years. It just seems the stock price for Huya doesn't add up to what the company is actually doing."

2021-04-27 00:07:28,wallstreetbets,Topo Chico Seltzer just came out and it's only in select states/cities. It has an insane following in Texas (state with 2nd most alcohol consumption behind Cali) and it looks like it's having huge success early in other places. It also tastes much better than White Claw and Truly imo.
2021-04-27 13:09:51,wallstreetbets,"That distributor is probably and independent distributor that their primary suppliers are Miller/Coors and Sam. Unless it’s Denver, I don’t know if any other cities that have MC owned distributors."

2021-04-26 20:00:44,wallstreetbets,"I definitely think Topo has potential, just take it from a guy who works in the industry that launch data is extremely skewed. For example, there are key account managers who broker deals with large format stores to have an item on display, on the weekly ad, with a minimum number of cases for an entire region. This might be a mandated 30 case display for a every ralphs/vons/albertsons. A typical grocery store's top selling seltzer may be 15 cases a week. Now topo chico comes in with a mandated 30 case display (twice the sales of the highest selling product), and bam when you average that out of a 30 day report it will show that this product is maybe the second or third best selling product. Yet only half of that display may actually sell through of a month, so really moving 3-4 cases a week instead of the 7 cases per week that an average report would run, because it only takes into account sales to retailers, not to consumers."

2021-04-27 14:33:40,wallstreetbets,"I’m suggesting that certain chains have the “continuity “ part of the franchise model down and some are much more hit miss.  You can give two guys the exact same ingredients and one could make a masterpiece and one could make something substandard.   I am saying that freshly grated cheese is better every time (as one example) but it doesn’t mean a poorly run or managed location with lax corporate oversight produces the same quality as a region with overall better training, oversight, and management.  Taco Bell is disgusting, but I give them credit for being absolutely, 100% consistently disgusting.  I’ll take my chances with the variability of my Del Taco experiences every single time."

2021-04-27 14:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Freshly grated cheese is better, but it doesn’t answer my question as to whether or not there exists variability in quality of ingredients from Del Taco to Del Taco. I can confidently say the one and only Del Taco I ate it was very bad, so assuming the quality among all Del Tacos is the same, then I can’t imagine I’m missing out on anything."
2021-04-26 20:10:36,wallstreetbets,I understand. Its good to consider alternate points of view and additional information.
2021-04-27 18:12:34,wallstreetbets," Not being in the supply chain at Del Taco not being a current or ex-employee I cannot answer that specific question.  I’ve eaten at numerous Del Tacos in CA and AZ and the quality varies per location.  Amount of meat or cheese or produce in an item.  Cook times on burgers, fries served warm vs hot or too little salt.  There are a multitude of things that cause the quality of the end product to vary.  They also MAY vary their suppliers by region so there may be regional differences.  

In n Out doesn’t expand because they refuse to go outside an area that guarantee the exact same supply chain...as an example.  

For a high end example of what I’m talking about, Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse is, generally a pretty good meal.  Maybe not on par with many elite steakhouses but certainly more upscale than an Outback.  In Las Vegas, there used to be 2 Ruth’s Chris.  One on Paradise and one on Flamingo.  The one on Flamingo was consistently a better meal.  5 miles apart, same chain and meals were different.  I’ve got to assume same ingredients.  Why did that happen?  Ironically, it was the one on Flamingo that closed.  

I’ll state my opinion that Del Taco, when done right, is head and shoulders over any Taco Bell.  Anyone who thinks Taco Bell IS a semi-decent representation of Mexican food  has clearly not had Mexican food. Consistent...yes.  Superior to anything else...no way."
2021-04-27 18:44:00,wallstreetbets,"Interesting anecdote about Ruth’s Chris but it appears we are conflating two ideas - the quality of the preparation of the meal vs the quality of the ingredients themselves. As you alluded to, the Del Taco suppliers may vary by region (albeit unlikely) so I cannot rule out the possibility of ingredient variation as I simply don’t know. 

I truthfully cannot recall what I ordered at the Grand Junction, CO Del Taco several years ago, but I do remember leaving thoroughly unimpressed both times I tried it. In comparison, I thought (and still think) Taco Bell was superior. Having said that, and I mentioned this earlier, I do not think Taco Bell is “quality” food by any means and I certainly don’t believe Taco Bell is a good representation of Mexican food. It’s actually an abomination if we are comparing it to authentic Mexican food. That much we can agree on. Tangentially my girlfriend at the time was Mexican and the best salsa I’ve ever had to date was made by her step-father who lived in Grand Junction only a few miles from the Del Taco.

In summary, Taco Bell is bad. Del Taco is worse, or at least the Del Taco in Grand Junction, CO. That is my opinion then and that is what it is now. I’d love to go to a Del Taco and put this theory to test since it’s been about five years but I live in NJ and the nearest Del Taco is about a 9 hour drive away in Ohio so unfortunately it may be many more years before I get the opportunity to try Del Taco again, but rest assured, when that day comes I will approach the taste-testing open-minded and I will

I then beefed up my retirement accounts and have seen amazing growth in them. I started educated myself more on trading and got back in. Pot stonks man. To the moon they went. I made a little there and by last years end I had gained my 1k back and then some. So at this point I’m subbed to all the finance subreddits except WSB. It looked fucking retarded and the bro yolo vibe was off putting. But the memes and underlying culture were like a siren song. They drew me in and then I saw a whole new world.

Still know fuck all about options (but I’m loving the education) I didn’t know the rates nor parameters for LTCGT and STCGT. Fuck I didn’t even know what retail investors were.

2021-04-27 04:37:32,wallstreetbets,"Man, you dumb bastards need to zoom out on the chart every once in a while. You sound just like the people who complained AMD was never gonna break 15 (see 2017 and half of 2018) or 30ish (see 2H 2018 and most of 2019). Look at the 5 year chart and ask yourself where you think this is going?

I'm not saying go out and buy calls, because sure, this thing could consolidate for another 6 months or a year, who knows! But barring a broader market downturn, this stock is going to boom at some point."
2021-04-27 14:42:04,wallstreetbets,"Depends on when they expire! If you bought long calls then hold on. But, even with great news AMD can drop. If they expire next week? Well, it has a track record of dropping on great news. That being said we may be seeing a turning point as Intel reported their data center sales were down 20% from last year. The big question is: did AMD pick up those missing sales from Intel? If so, it could get real fun for AMD holders."
2021-04-27 14:37:51,wallstreetbets,"I've been in AMD since 2016. Cost basis is sitting around $12, as I kept adding to my position as it rose. The options games is definitely risky for this stock... seems that on any good news the stock will drop. An earnings beat? AMD drops 5%. A new chip that kills Intel? Stock drops again. It's retarded.

But, as frustrating as it is, whatever is going on ""behind the scenes"" to cause this cannot continue as AMD gains market share and technical advantage over competitors. But, to gain better leverage I've started making long call options. In addition to my AMD stocks, I have a couple of calls: 85 01/22 and 90 06/22. I'm pretty confident that by next year AMD will break out of it's current lull and those bets should give me a nice return."
2021-04-27 15:42:45,wallstreetbets,">seems that on any good news the stock will drop

This has not always been the case with AMD. That was the point of my previous post. If you've been holding since 2016 you should know that there have been periods when good news and product announcements do indeed boost the stock. But AMD goes on streaks, and those streaks are followed by consolidation periods where good news has little effect on the stock. That's been the case since October or so.

The main reason I responded to the previous poster is because they were saying they think AMD may have peaked at $99. I don't think that is true, and I was pointing out the other long consolidation periods over the last 5 years or so. AMD is still in a fantastically strong competitive position in relation to Intel so I believe good times are still ahead.

Like you, I often hold a few calls in addition to my stock. Good luck to us today!"

2021-04-27 16:16:12,wallstreetbets,"You are correct, and I have probably become cynical over the last few years because of how counterintuitive the stock moves. I have seen over 500% gain since adding (long position) AMD to my portfolio, after all. 

I believe I will see AMD rise into the hundreds if they keep performing at the pace they are. That being said, if I had been playing options I would have lost more than I have gained. I have been wrong on so many ERs and product announcements. That is why I made the above comments. My long position has been the only thing I've done well."
2021-04-27 01:37:24,wallstreetbets,"Alright, so if sold 91 is making more than 100 with both ITM, but because the 100 might have cost 10 times less, the actual payout is potentially much better for the 100 than the 91."
2021-04-27 16:22:35,wallstreetbets,"I've been burned by short term calls on several occasions, but LEAPS were good to me from 2017 to 2019 (for the most part). Good job getting long dated calls. It hurts to watch them drop to pennies on the dollar, but they can make it up and then some when the long runs finally come.

Here's hoping this pop holds after AMD's beat and raise!"
2021-04-27 09:45:10,wallstreetbets,"While ITM the 91 calls make more money, yes, but atm, you can buy three more 100C than 91C, so once 100C goes in the money, it grows three times faster than the 91C.  So closer to ITM Calls are less risky, but since you can buy much more OTM Calls, the payout potential is much higher if the Stock goes above the OTM strike."

That has nothing to do with any of what I said.

I will say it one last time, even though this is cumming in the sink (might be fun but ultimately useless):

There are a number of recognised valuation models for stocks.
One method is Comparable Companies Analysis.

This uses P/B, P/E, and EV/EBITDA ratios to inform fair valuation.
I'm saying that on this basis, Viacom is undervalued right now, a steal really.

If I decided to run a full DCF analysis on Viacom, the ratios would still lead me to a similar conclusion.

So, again, what on earth do you think I'm even saying and (more importantly) what do you think you are even saying?"

2021-04-26 20:40:30,wallstreetbets,"Which specific program do you feel unfairly stole money and went “100% to stock buybacks”

As someone who dug into this, a large problem was early government subsidies went to backbone projects, but not last-mile projects. That’s how you end up in a situation where 1 side of a street gets gigabit fiber, the other side doesn’t. That last extension is expensive and complicated.

For backbone projects, the money wasn’t stolen, the ISPs delivered exactly what was promised.

You’re entirely missing the point I was making. Every mid to large city has at least 1 ISP(even if it’s Comcast it still counts for something). High to mid density populations are economical to service. It’s unreasonable to expect an ISP to spend $1000/mile to lay down fiber for communities where neighbors are miles apart."

2021-04-26 22:25:10,wallstreetbets,"Just because you responded today ill jot some thoughts down

I think the market will slowly realize the aggregate valuation of these businesses is far greater than the roughly 30B it's at today, but obviously it will need some revenue growth to support it. Here are some of my thoughts on why

Ctx001 is almost certainly going to be the first product to market, so we can't extrapolate a trend from one product, but as more and more of these clinical trials come to fruition, I think something pretty profound is going to be realized. What I believe is that if the gene is well understood and you can:

1) safely deliver the edit to the majority of cells and

2) have your edit be persistent, 

then your clinical trial is going to work most of the time. And if I'm correct about this, it's going to lead to an expansion of margins across the board. 

And the second part of this is that some edits are going to be broadly applicable. This stuff isn't going to stop at rare diseases. And because there is normally some pareto like distributions in capitalism for who ends up makeing what, I'm guessing 5-10 companies capture these edits. I know this sounds vague, but an example of what I'm talking about is Verve/Beam partnership. Read the following, and I think it will click. (https://www.vervetx.com/approach/)"

My parents had two, maybe three TV channels when they were young. It went to a test screen after midnight. I was lucky enough to enjoy cable TV starting in 1988 (29 channels, minus the three movie channels that were blurred out) 

I'm 40 but movie stores were almost as cool as going to the mall in the early 90's. We suffer from too much choice now. It was way more enjoyable to browse the movie store than it is to browse Netflix, despite how much more convenient it is.

Convenience does not always equate to more enjoyable. Older heads like us know."
2021-04-27 00:44:54,wallstreetbets,I would rent on my parent's account. Not sure where you were located but we could rent movies from the age of whenever.

It's completely possible to have a 2 hours session on a 1g dose or even less and then take a diazepam after to kill the lingering effects. If you convert the psilocybin to psilocyn straight away before ingesting (I think vit C in lemon juice does it, forgot the exact process) the trip is even shorter because you cut out 30/45mn of digestion and come up."

>The number of shares short for Discovery class A increased 13.43 mn from February 25th to March 30th. As of March 30th 58.98 million of Discovery class A shares were short representing 42.59% of the float. In the same period, 17.84 mn shares of Discovery C class were sold short. A similar attempt to short Discovery B class shares resulted in a short squeeze due to low float.  
>  
>Given the initial success of Discovery plus, I don't think there is a fundamental case to short Discovery at these levels. 

Something to keep in mind here - there is ALWAYS a high short interest in $DISCA. Always has been always will be. Why you ask? Because of the [SHARE CLASS TRADE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X1000156X) between DISCA/DISCK. This flip-flops every once in a while, but currently DISCK trades at a discount to DISCA and at some point that discount is expected to collapse (a variety of reasons), but in the meantime, a lot of hedge funds buy DISCK and short DISCA as a result in order to realize that spread. This is the same with plenty of share class trades (LBRDK/LBRDA - or any liberty stock for that matter).  


So while the short interest has increased like you said, the base short interest in DISCA isn't really a short thesis and a squeeze won't work on them because if you squeeze DISCA, then DISCK (which they own) goes up so they're losing on one side but winning on the other and its a wash.   


If you look at the holders list for HFs below the top 10 on DISCK (HBK, River Road, DE Shaw...) you can bet a lot of them have that position hedged with shorts in DISCA"

2021-04-26 23:43:27,wallstreetbets,"12,400 standard deduction plus I own a house that I deduct interest plus Schwab's method of in and out accounting usually works in my favor"
2021-04-26 22:13:43,wallstreetbets,"I already wasted most of your day, I am pretty happy with that. You keep saying no one cares, but clearly you care, you can't let it go. Reply again bro, lets see how much you don't care."
2021-04-27 00:05:33,wallstreetbets,Shhh incel shhh
2021-04-26 22:05:50,wallstreetbets,He is looking pretty good now. MORON.
2021-04-26 22:06:59,wallstreetbets,Get back at me when my puts expire May 7th. That shareholder tally will cause a world of hurt.
2021-04-26 22:07:57,wallstreetbets,"Wait till this rally is over before buying puts, lol. It hits 15 no problem before then."
2021-04-26 22:08:54,wallstreetbets,I've had my puts since they announced the vote about a month ago so I'm holding for a minute. Lol
2021-04-26 22:10:47,wallstreetbets,Dude I think you missed your chance. This is not going under 9-10 again. You realize they might vote no right? And they won't dilute till 2022 anyway? And dilution got priced in when they shorted it by 40% when it got announced?
2021-04-26 22:14:21,wallstreetbets,"If they vote no that's worse news for the stock. Idk if you've been to an AMC recently but every one that I've seen is a ghost town. I mean I understand that's anecdotal. Dilution isn't priced in when it was trading for higher than pre Covid. There's no way. 

It'll go up to 15-17, but then it'll crash. Low side 3-5, high side 5-7. But anything could happen. Who knows."
2021-04-26 22:19:59,wallstreetbets,"It will have some ups and downs, but AMC going triple digits I'll send you a postcard from the moon."
2021-04-26 22:23:56,wallstreetbets,AMC is not going triple digits lmao. You new to the market? You realize what it traded pre Covid? You realize where that would put its market cap compared to other theatres that have better balance sheets? I truly wish you luck sir.
2021-04-27 08:45:08,wallstreetbets,Bless their heart.
2021-04-26 20:21:59,wallstreetbets,"I hear you, pricey for sure.  TSLA has been moving around a lot too!  It doesn’t follow fundamentals but it’s price is due to the growth potential.  We shall see how it goes."
2021-04-26 21:01:33,wallstreetbets,"yep, TSLA stock definitely doesn't follow the rules of this Earth, still remember the moment i call 12 shares thought my hand, my heart was beating so fast! back in march, i told myself that ""with same money I could bought more AMC shares and i must be nut"" lmfao 

Well, no doubt i'm still ape."
2021-04-27 06:48:41,wallstreetbets,There are going to be great developments in the coming months! You and your friend are set!
2021-04-27 06:49:46,wallstreetbets,Remaining steadfast is a necessity! Good for the both of you!
2021-04-27 18:25:10,wallstreetbets,Sounds familiar 😩
2021-04-27 18:27:10,wallstreetbets,That’s what she said
2021-04-27 07:13:37,wallstreetbets,The Sorrento CEO(s) have been on a hype train for years. It seems that a blockbuster new drug is always in the offing.
2021-04-27 18:52:48,wallstreetbets,That too!
2021-04-27 07:31:51,wallstreetbets,"GOOD NEWS! RYAN COHEN HAS HALF BILLY TO SPEND ON TUESDAY MORNING.

WHAT A BIG TUESDAY ENTRANCE!"
2021-04-27 02:03:16,wallstreetbets,"Jesus fuck bud, you were one week off."
2021-04-27 18:05:33,wallstreetbets,It 10000 percent did not hit
2021-04-27 18:06:09,wallstreetbets,Came close yesterday
2021-04-27 18:08:22,wallstreetbets,Bro. The options expired on fucking last Friday hahahahha

2021-04-27 10:15:19,wallstreetbets,You hold?
2021-04-26 23:54:52,wallstreetbets,I was thinking about selling but your post kept me in!
2021-04-27 18:02:56,wallstreetbets,"I am in the trial as well. Had my first crossover last week. They told me ""EUA has been filed"". A few other people in the trial reported getting the same info."
2021-04-27 09:21:47,wallstreetbets,"i wanna sell @ my 16@76avg ... but I'm poor enough for it to make sense to wait till next year to not pay capital gains. so im in long for at least another 9mo. 

FLU + COVID + MALARIA ... 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-27 18:38:05,wallstreetbets,Luckily you didn’t sell.
2021-04-26 21:54:00,wallstreetbets,I am ape
2021-04-26 22:11:58,wallstreetbets,This dude is straight balling today!
2021-04-27 06:06:58,wallstreetbets,We need an update with the green pics
2021-04-27 14:52:11,wallstreetbets,MVIS  will drop under $11...
2021-04-27 01:37:08,wallstreetbets,Imagine.
2021-04-26 20:38:23,wallstreetbets,"Hey, Im from the future, 5 days after your post. MVIS is now up +47.08 during market hours and up +9.08% in after hours. How are those covered calls of yours doing?"
2021-04-27 10:32:36,wallstreetbets,Price change is higher than the option value right now. Might roll them up and take take the profit and reset the CC strike.
2021-04-27 15:34:06,wallstreetbets,"Just FYI since you like being a bitch, I'll be a bitch right back.

I rolled my CCs on the huge dip today, made profit on the difference.

Sold new CCs for more money at higher strike prices.

Hope you sold your options at $28 instead of the at the huge drop today!"
2021-04-26 22:04:33,wallstreetbets,Congrats. Now you're a millionaire
2021-04-27 03:07:48,wallstreetbets,Thanks man
2021-04-27 03:07:16,wallstreetbets,Thanks :)
2021-04-27 03:11:37,wallstreetbets,"Just curious, were GME and MVIS your two biggest plays or have you blown up on anything else?"
2021-04-27 03:31:33,wallstreetbets,"I played around with SPACs too but other than that, yea, GME and MVIS were my biggest plays. 

Initially made even more by gambling with pre-LOI SPACs but then the feb-march correction hit me pretty hard because I was highly leveraged with margin. AJAX made me lose some 40% of my portfolio. 

Clawed my way back with GME’s second squeeze and then lost 25% to another SPAC: NPA. 

Promised myself not to touch SPACs again... for now..."
2021-04-27 07:31:55,wallstreetbets,"200 shares at 35.8, lets HOLD"
2021-04-27 07:55:44,wallstreetbets,This is worthy of Sportscenter Top 10!

2021-04-27 15:56:46,wallstreetbets,I'm greased up on these tendies so far.
2021-04-27 15:12:30,wallstreetbets,This aged well.
2021-04-27 16:30:32,wallstreetbets,lmao whoops
2021-04-27 16:25:40,wallstreetbets,I hope you didn’t roll. Look at it go.
2021-04-27 16:26:46,wallstreetbets,I am still holding strong and haven’t rolled! Hoping for some news still!
2021-04-27 16:28:52,wallstreetbets,Omg dude it’s up to 257$. I took some profits. But who knows maybe they have news for today.
2021-04-27 16:31:26,wallstreetbets,I still think Thursday is a likely day for news. They historically have released big news on Thu (coupled with a NYT article). If not I still believe one of these catalysts will drop within 2 weeks. I do still plan to roll out on Friday though.
2021-04-27 17:59:06,wallstreetbets,I might buy some weeklies. I’ve partially recouped my losses on this run up.
2021-04-27 19:42:49,wallstreetbets,I’d be cautious with weeklies just bc the IV is so insanely high that the premiums are crazy expensive (especially after this run). Makes your breakeven price super high and theta decay killer. Maybe you can do debit spreads if you want to play weeklies?
2021-04-27 03:59:19,wallstreetbets,Drop marijuana to schedule 2  on the DEA Drug Scheduling🤔🤔🤔
2021-04-27 11:57:50,wallstreetbets,Looks like CLOV is up 10% for the last 5 days of trading. Anyone know the cost basis the shorts got in at? I would imagine they are currently losing a decent amount of money?
2021-04-27 03:23:07,wallstreetbets,3.87 billion
2021-04-27 00:04:11,wallstreetbets,Ya.... so uhhh....
2021-04-27 01:51:54,wallstreetbets,"I was skeptical too, but I cannot imagine watching the defense lay down its case and thinking he was getting off lol"
2021-04-26 20:08:14,wallstreetbets,You still in Wolf? You got a great entry so wouldn't blame you for taking some profits here. I'm at $7.87 average with 61K+ shares and will start taking some off around 20% gain.  Planning to keep at least half for after earnings on May 10th.  This one  can jump quite a bit when it becomes obvious that last quarter wasn't a flake.
2021-04-27 13:31:09,wallstreetbets,Nice! Holding 3200 @ 8.35 wish I could've bought at the price you did 😆
2021-04-27 08:26:18,wallstreetbets,The wolf is still in!
2021-04-27 13:08:37,wallstreetbets,Bett ypu feeling a lil bettwr today
2021-04-27 13:41:51,wallstreetbets,"Yes, from a home builder, we’ve been having to bump prices like crazy bc the price of our materials keep going up"
2021-04-27 13:53:44,wallstreetbets,"Are you seeing push back from customers or people deciding to not go forward with the build? I'm trying to understand whether demand will drop this year before fall, or whether demand will be sustained until next year."
2021-04-27 13:58:37,wallstreetbets,"Demand has been pretty crazy overall in the past quarter. Most of our buyers just eat the price increase but keep in mind most of our clients are buying luxury custom homes. The demand of more expensive homes has been on the rise for the past year, while less expensive homes have actually had a slight decline. As of now, there are still a lot of new builds otw and contracts being signed. We’re actually finalizing two contracts now for two new communities"
2021-04-27 14:09:38,wallstreetbets,How far in advance do you book these contracts? Do you have any sense of what the demand might be like next spring for luxury homes (one year from now)?
2021-04-27 14:27:31,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, only been there for about a year, so I’m still relatively new in the industry, but we usually have contracts for around a year. Mainly subdivisions and townhomes and we’re predicting the demand to still be high (relative to pre-covid) for at least the next year"
2021-04-27 16:25:52,wallstreetbets,Thanks for these insights.
2021-04-26 23:39:39,wallstreetbets,I chortled 🤣

2021-04-27 03:51:39,wallstreetbets,Where’s your loss porn??
2021-04-27 03:52:16,wallstreetbets,None yet but I’ll keep you posted.
2021-04-27 03:06:22,wallstreetbets,So they took a bunch of expiring contracts got them all renewed and extended. How is this not moving the needle?  That's all money they weren't going to get before and having them in one bundle makes them easier to manage?  No?
2021-04-26 22:05:18,wallstreetbets,Hope Yolo works out.  I hear alot of people trying to short this.  Maybe it will drop hard after not so good earnings.  I checked there website its not even secure.   Can someone post some of there sales figures or a wishper number?   \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/xaHoGh1.png](https://i.imgur.com/xaHoGh1.png))  14 Puts look mighty tempting at this point.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
