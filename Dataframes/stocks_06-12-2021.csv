2021-06-12 16:51:02,stocks,"Well, the fact that they can actually run out of cash this year is a huge red flag. You can lose 100% of your investment if things go wrong.  I‚Äôd not be comfortable holding it."
2021-06-12 17:33:57,stocks,"You ask for an honest discussion and then argue against every bearish point that commenters write. The fact is that there is almost no bull case for RIDE, and it‚Äôs very easy for any unbiased observer to see why the company is heavily shorted. 

The CEO has a shady history, he gave the worlds worst interview on live tv (while also affirming Hindenburg‚Äôs article that they have no firm orders), the company was late to deliver its financials this past quarter, and the icing on the cake, they may go bankrupt before they even start production DESPITE just recently going public. 

The company literally only has red flags. You may get lucky on a trade but as an investment this one is about as bad as it gets."
2021-06-12 18:57:18,stocks,"I honestly haven't been closely following this company or others like it as most of their prices have soared to crazy levels despite the high risk. RIDE is coming down from the high and back to reality,  and the reality isn't very bright at the moment. They're not cooked **yet**, but the writing is crystal clear for those who didn't see it before: ""This is a very high risk investment that might fail, for real.""

I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if a lot of other EV startups end up in a similar position over the next year or 2. The automobile industry is fucking brutal. Tesla is the most wellknown EV-centric company out there and they *still* can't turn a profit on their car sales."
2021-06-12 17:37:01,stocks,"Good luck with $RIDE. I would like to be wrong about them, they do really portray a great story but I don't buy and I established this thesis back in January when I was looking at them at $27. I thought it was a steal, I really liked the concept. 

I just have a habit of checking in on executives and the board of directors. Mainly I look for diversity because I believe people with different backgrounds will bring different ideas and perspectives to a company.  Stephen S. Burns caught my eye in a bad way though and this was before Hindenburg came out with their report. 

I don't know where you are getting the idea the Hindenburg report has been proven false. I haven't seen anything besides WSB conspiracy posts about the ""evil hedgie short sellers"". If you have a solid source I'd look into it for sure though."
2021-06-12 17:25:54,stocks,"What is the bear case? Well, running out of money before producing anything?"
2021-06-12 17:11:39,stocks,"They need more cash to even START production. 

Their recent truck entry into the Baja 250 withdrew after 40 miles.

My understanding is that they have ZERO actual firm commitments for orders? I may be wrong. 

The only reason to be in this stock is as a potential meme, which is not out of the realm of possibility as currently on Fidelity it cannot be shorted without calling Fidelity directly. 

But if you have a few bucks you want to throw into a lotto ticket, buy a few cheap options."
2021-06-12 19:11:45,stocks,lmao. scam
2021-06-12 16:59:46,stocks,I have a bridge to sell you ü§£
2021-06-12 18:58:14,stocks,I Can‚Äôt handle the volatility of RIDE. Having enough of a ‚Äúride‚Äù over at HYLN lol. I hope both succeed.
2021-06-12 17:32:55,stocks,"They‚Äôre already far behind schedule and if one truck rolls off the line in September, they can claim they ‚Äústarted mass production,‚Äù but the reality is they will in no way meet production estimates and at this point, they‚Äôll be too far behind to catch up."
2021-06-12 18:55:30,stocks,"The bear case is that they don't have sufficient capital to start production latter this year, you just assume that they can raise capital out of thin air but tye company has been accused of lying and already had investors spooked, if they cannot raise capital to start the company is dead, this is also not helped by the fact that every single day they don't get up and running they lose money, the amount of uncertainty with this stock is a bear case on its own."
2021-06-12 19:02:32,stocks,"Stay away from this garbage. 

If you want something that has cow over moon potential AND is a quality company look at CLNE. A RNG play.

JMHO."
2021-06-12 19:19:13,stocks,"I‚Äôm with you on RIDE. 2.5K shares and 10 options so far. Most of the bear comments here are just things people were spoon fed by biased analysts and the shoddy Hindenburg report. It‚Äôs a risk, but an informed one for me. A year from now, I‚Äôll have 10 times my initial investment. Mark the post and get back to me. Holding for sweet returns."
2021-06-12 17:43:24,stocks,"It's funny to see the negative comments that are based on completely incorrect information in this thread. 

They have no real orders. Oh? 30,000 plus paid deposits as of the earnings release. 

Buy the bonds instead.  Well, they have zero bond debt.

Just an observation of how the media portrayal clouds the facts."
2021-06-12 19:42:32,stocks,RIDE is going to be fine. The company has deep connections wirh powerful politicians.  They are not going to simply go bust for lack of trying.  The stock will see some volatility but I‚Äôm confident they will get the investment partner they need.
2021-06-12 18:57:32,stocks,I would go WKHS.  IMHO   NFA
2021-06-12 19:10:28,stocks,"If any people are involved that used to be with G.M there,I would be scared as hell of it. Too many gangsters in Lordstown. I wouldn't trust anyone there."
2021-06-12 16:52:29,stocks,"Again, they have several ways to raise more capital. Worse case scenario they get a high interest loan or share dilution.. Best case scenario they get the government loan (ATVM) which they are in advanced talks with..."
2021-06-12 19:03:29,stocks,You're 100% correct pal.
2021-06-12 17:49:15,stocks,"Why do you say I'm ""arguin"" I'm providing verifiable facts and bullish arguments that refute those statements. 

Pre-orders are non-binding, they always were and that was always clear. The way the media spun this is ridiculous (Tesla, Ford Lightning etc. All do this to gauge interest) this isn't mildly controversial.  They knew the 10k filing would be late because the SEC changed the requirements (for spacs) at the last minute. There was no penalty for this (they had until July to update their records and submit).
Again, they are not going bankrupt. If u think they won't be able to secure funding why do you think that?"
2021-06-12 19:16:28,stocks,"This is a good level headed take. Thanks for your perspective. It is a speculative play for sure.

What's interesting is that the price drop was mostly due to the Hindenburg short report, which is (for the majority) all fabricated lies.

I think the EVs and growth / tech stocks pulling back as they were over valued is a very fair point, I just think RIDE pulled back much more than it's fair share."
2021-06-12 17:55:40,stocks,"Thank you for the reply, the company will be releasing something official soon. They have been silent on the issue due to legal requirements. That being said the ""fake orders"" allegations as well as the ""2 to 3 years away from production"" are false, by default, since they are on track for September production (per latest sec filings) and have 30k real reservations with deposits (per the earnings call). Those were the most ""crushing"" elements from the short report."
2021-06-12 17:28:01,stocks,Why do you think they would be unable to raise capital to ramp up production?
2021-06-12 17:20:12,stocks,"Needing cash to start production would be typical for all automakers, can they secure capital is the big question, if you think this isn't likely, why?

The truck ended the Baja because 40 miles in the sand required too much energy and they misjudged that (battery drain). The truck and hub motors worked flawlessly. 

They have 30k serious reservations with deposits

Agreed, huge potential meme stock. But it's also grossly undervalued because of the fud that the media is spreading (you are a good case in point).

Imo this isn't luck, it's a sure thing."
2021-06-12 19:18:14,stocks,"Please explain why you think that, can you provide some proof to your accusations?"
2021-06-12 17:03:49,stocks,Do you have anything constructive to add to the discussion?
2021-06-12 19:06:18,stocks,"People love to hate RIDE and HYLN lol, good luck brother"
2021-06-12 17:52:18,stocks,Catch up to what? They are first to market.. Ford is at least a year away... no other direct competitors (fleets) in sight... even if they were to push back production 1 or 2 quarters... it doesn't mean they are going to fail...
2021-06-12 19:12:30,stocks,"That's fair. They will be releasing statements on the accusations (Hindenburg) and concluding the sec inquiry very soon which will settle those trust issues. They also have an open house in two weeks to show investors what's under the hood (no pun intended). There is a lot of fud, but if you dissect it (really look at the facts) it's been spun and worded by the media to be much worse than it really is. They should also get an answer for the ATVM loan very soon."
2021-06-12 19:05:15,stocks,"Please provide an argument to why you think this is ""garbage"""
2021-06-12 17:50:06,stocks,"thank you, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. LoL"
2021-06-12 19:08:18,stocks,"Huge fan of WKHS, shame they lost the USPS.. they definitely got robbed"
2021-06-12 17:01:32,stocks,"You're delusional if you don't recognize that the actual worst case scenario is they go under. They barely have a functioning prototype and other big players are entering the market fast (like Ford). They don't stand a chance IMO, but its possible they'll be bought."
2021-06-12 17:00:36,stocks,"Why be in stock, then?  If it rolls over, you'd be better in bonds that would likely convert to shares in a bankruptcy."
2021-06-12 17:56:41,stocks,"It was definitely not always clear that the pre orders were non binding. That wasn‚Äôt clear until the botched interview following Hindenburg‚Äôs piece. 

And so if pre-orders are non binding, then how do you know anyone will even buy one of these? 

And how do you know they aren‚Äôt going bankrupt? You think companies release statements everyday saying that they have no money to operate? 

Fortunately for them, liquidity is easy these days so it‚Äôs possible that they won‚Äôt go bankrupt. But if you have shares in RIDE, you can expect to be HEAVILY diluted over the coming months and years. Again none of this is bullish as a stockholder."
2021-06-12 18:22:51,stocks,How long will investors keep burning their money for a company that has almost no sales/competition is superior/are warning they may run out money/have a shitty product?
2021-06-12 17:23:14,stocks,"I won't ever tell someone they are wrong when making stock predictions, but when companies go from ""we will start production in November"" to ""we are running out of money and may go under without ever producing a single truck"" that tends to make people nervous. FUD exists around shaky companies for a reason.

It's all risk/benefit tolerances. This is a high risk company. What percent chance of losing all your money does it make it no longer tolerable to hold a stock?"
2021-06-12 19:37:31,stocks,"Have you looked at WSB, Investing, Stocks subreddits? Ever wondered why everytime anything related to RIDE is posted on these subs, people love to this on this stock and call it a scam? And that literately the only place where it isn't shat on is the Lordstown sub because that place is full of delusional people? You people are like flat earthers and have created a little religion around your little stock. Nothing will ever change your mind and I don't care to try because at the end of the day, when RIDE goes bankrupt, its your money that goes down the drain, not mine."
2021-06-12 17:12:29,stocks,"Yes, Stephen S. Burns is a con artist. He has a history of taking companies public with shady accounting, stops inches short of flat out lying to shareholders and often tries to leave gullible shareholders with the bill for his start ups.

He's a hell of a salesman and knows how to wow investors with a flashy product. Unfortunately, take the endurance for example, his products tend to lack functionality. The endurance looks like a cool pickup for personal use but he's trying to sell it off as a fleet vehicle even though it doesn't come close to the range anyone with a fleet of trucks would actually need. He can tell you a great story, but can't deliver a great product.

Also, a high short interest is not actually a bullish sign and not everything is a short squeeze. Obviously, big money isn't being fooled and they know Stephen S. Burns is going to drop the bill off on his long term shareholders once again and those that are short will never have to cover.

So, you ready to buy my bridge yet?"
2021-06-12 19:10:19,stocks,"Yes they feel like because the SP is low, the company is shit. They‚Äôre falling right into what the manipulators want, so they can accumulate slowly."
2021-06-12 19:20:05,stocks,"I disagree, ignoring what the media said or what they didn't say, this company needs to raise cash In a time when they are under sec investigation and are hemorrhaging cash, this isn't a tech startup, starting a car company requires a million times more capital so the company doesn't have much time. It's just that the risk reward here is quite awful, say they are found guilty by the sec or they fail to raise cash, both of which are real possibilities they are dead in the water. Everyday there lingers uncertainty with this company they will fail to raise cash and won't have a product to market. And this is also ignoring the enormous competition from tesla and Ford and the fact they're ceo has been accused of fraud and not just by hindenburg. I understand theyvare doing an open house but tbh I don't really trust this company and I doubt many other investors do and as long as that sentiment exists they aren't going anywhere."
2021-06-12 19:25:33,stocks,"Well a lot of it has been stated already and dare I suggest you've fallen in love with the stock but here goes.

1. They recently missed their filing... never a good sign.
2. Management has made false promises and does not have the best track record. A good management team is essential in these start up companies. Confirmed orders vs. interest. That interview made me cringe.
3. Ford and GM are going to eat Lordstown lunch and drink their milkshake. Ford's Lightning is cheaper AND is from a proven company. Which would you buy? I'll wait for Ford thanks.
4. They're broke and have recently admitted that they need to raise money. If this is via stock they'll need to issue piles. If they borrow... it will not be in very favourable terms... imho. My guess is they'll issue dirt cheap warrants and/or debs.

You need to critically take a look at this company and ask yourself... how easy do you think it is to bring an EV to market? If it is difficult for the established auto companies what makes you think Lordstown can do it... especially with all the red flags.

Do yourself a favour.. take your loss and dump this garbage."
2021-06-12 19:12:54,stocks,Trust me mate you are.
2021-06-12 19:18:34,stocks,"I wouldn't touch either. Play NIO if you want an EV stock. 

Both WKHS and RIDE are absolute crap shoots. If you like gambling though... sure stick with it."
2021-06-12 17:08:44,stocks,"Tell me why you think going under is a real imminent risk? Why raising capital is not the most likely scenario? 

The ""barely functioning prototype"" argument is categorically false. They have beta's now (over 50, most of which are road worthy, currently being driven and collecting data)

Ford won't have the lightning ready for at least another year... and their fleet model won't be ready until 2023. (Btw the $40k model they are advertising is very basic..  crank windows...  many more moving parts and much higher maintenance costs)"
2021-06-12 17:38:25,stocks,"There are no bonds, they are debt free."
2021-06-12 17:03:07,stocks,"Again, bankruptcy nowhere near an immediate risk. If you think so, why?"
2021-06-12 18:31:03,stocks,"No the preorders were definitely clear, everyone just didnt do there DD or follow the stock enough"
2021-06-12 18:13:51,stocks,"The segment on Mad Money (CNBC) literally had ""Non Binding pre orders"" scroll across the bottom of the screen during the interview. They also have several verifiable instances where he calls them non-binding. The issue is that everyone calls them something different and he doesn't always correct them (orders, pre-orders, reservations). It's all semantics. At the end of the day, they won't be able to make the trucks fast enough for he demand that they have.

They have 30k real reservations now, with deposits (and growing).

During the earnings call, they were very clear that they were seeking asset backed loan or the ATVM (non dilutive). I agree that once they've secured funding (and stock jumps up) they would likely do a share offering to really set themselves up for the future (but long term this would be bullish)"
2021-06-12 18:27:20,stocks,"No sales: it's a startup, why is this an argument?

Competition: they are first to market in this segment, less moving parts, less maintenance costs than the competition 

Low on cash statement: this is a legal requirement, they have tons of options to raise capital

Shitty product: to be determined, beta's look and perform great so far."
2021-06-12 17:32:45,stocks,"The hypothetical situation where they run out of cash and go under is a ""going concern"". Legally speaking that is one (of many) scenarios that they must disclose in the 10k filing. It's a legal obligation for them to disclose that to their shareholders (however minuscule is the risk). The FUD over this nothing-burger is completely out of line with reality... what would you say the percentage of change they won't be able to secure funding (therefore going under) under this current US administration? I would put those odds at under 1%. Low risk, huge reward. Right?"
2021-06-12 17:25:23,stocks,"Burns being a con artist is Hindenburg propaganda. That entire short report has been proven full of lies and half truths. The Endurance doesn't lack functionality. What fleet manager needs more than a 250 mile range between charges?

My point wasnt that high short interest  was bullish, simply that it's quite abnormal"
2021-06-12 19:51:16,stocks,Always been a gambler!
2021-06-12 17:06:56,stocks,"Your discussion is focused on draining cash... How long before they have a product on the streets?

If it's more than 2years, high interest would kill them."
2021-06-12 17:39:42,stocks,"I wouldn't call that a nothing burger. I don't know how likely they are to secure more funding. If I did I wouldn't be here talking to you, I'd be on a yacht. 

The risk of losing your six figure investment is not trivial. Personally that would make me a little nervous. But hey you might make millions/year and it's just pocket change to you. 

We will see what happens."
2021-06-12 17:10:19,stocks,"They are on track for mass producing trucks staring at the end of September with deliveries in December of this year. 

Edit: why downvotes? We're downvoting facts now?"
2021-06-12 18:58:46,stocks,Thanks for sharing your perspective
2021-06-12 19:09:50,stocks,They're gonna make like 1000 trucks maybe. That will NOT save them.
2021-06-12 17:38:02,stocks,Good question about downvotes.. not from me!
2021-06-12 19:21:13,stocks,But why would they stop there. The robots are all programmed and factory is all tooled... any investor will see that this is a sure investment at that point
2021-06-12 19:26:55,stocks,"Because they don't have the money... like they literally said that at the moment with current funding that's what they can make. They will go bankrupt if they don't get that money. Personally, if I had 200m (or whatever they're asking) I wouldn't even think of investing into this company to save them. You on stocktwits? Your points literally just mimic what those dudes spew on there."
2021-06-12 19:44:03,stocks,Holy fuck. Stop going in circles man about not having money. Jesus christ.
2021-06-12 19:45:19,stocks,How am I going in circles...? That's the bear case here. Their financials are kinda fucked. What....?
2021-06-12 19:46:15,stocks,You're hopeless. All you keep saying is about financial. That's the easy part you twit.
2021-06-12 19:48:30,stocks,What the fuck are you talking about
2021-06-12 17:41:31,stocks,"You‚Äôre missing a bear case, a couple thoughts. 

1) Market has been red hot and ALL brokers have been seeing a huge influx of new members. This is not sustainable. 
2) If interest rates rise, this one will be hit very hard as much cash flows in the future 
3) A p/s of 19 is not what anyone would call ‚Äúlight‚Äù. FUTU also has significantly higher margins and earnings than TIGR and so just comparing p/s doesn‚Äôt mean much."
2021-06-12 19:43:21,stocks,Long TIGR. This is one great company and my PT is in the 40$ range. I am confident in their prospects in growing in east asia.
2021-06-12 19:47:04,stocks,"Absolutely love it...probably 1 of my favorite stocks all year
A group of us abuse this ticker daily"
2021-06-12 18:00:16,stocks,The stock is 621% up for the last year and is already very overvalued
2021-06-12 19:00:46,stocks,"Agreed about the influx of new customers and not being sustainable, but remember that we are talking about China, Singapore, etc. Areas of the world that have massive populations and populations that are seeing access to things like casual investing that they never had. It won't continue forever, and the unpredictable nature of China's leadership could cut them off completely without warning, but if things remain unchanged there won't be a slow down in new memberships for TIGR anytime soon.

In terms of p/s, well...welcome to the new economy I guess. Technicals like p/s, p/e, etc don't seem to matter anymore. One day the hens will come home to roost and maybe we get a collapse of some of these ridiculously overvalued stocks, but good luck predicting when that could happen. Do you want to be the person that predicts it'll come crashing down at 30 only to see it blow up to 150, or do you want to be the person that rides the wave until it does come crashing down (if it does)?"
2021-06-12 19:41:41,stocks,"I'm not sure you know what you're talking about. A P/S of 19 for a company growing at 353% YOY is INSANELY cheap. This is like picking up a brand new Tesla Model S Plaid for 5000USD. 


Second of all it's app is mostly used by the chinese market. The chinese retail movement is only beginning to start- they have incredibly tight capital account convertability controls that are only beginning to be loosened. As the CCP pursues great capital account convertibility TIGR will inevitably rise with the tide."
2021-06-12 19:36:32,stocks,"I agree it's had a great run, but I feel there is enough room left to run to make a good return, and there's still some ways to go before we're back at the ATH."

Quantum computing will give huge advantages militarily and commercially thus the competition. U/unclestanky please research quantum computing a bit, its extremely important. Success is not guaranteed but the race for quantum computing is real"

Difficult problems arent going to be solved by people that sit down and say that the technology is unobtainable. Why do people sit on their soapbox and relish in that?"
2021-06-12 17:48:42,stocks,"Opinion on the technical side instead of stock price action:

Good tech in their area of hardware architecture (in traps), but their area won't be the on that wins in the end imho. Same goes for companies that work on photonic quantum computing (e.g. Zapata), also imho. My bet is on the companies working on superconducting qubits on silicon chips, e.g. ones IBM and Google.

EDIT: Just additional comments. I'm not saying the IonQ's and Zapata's have no place in the field, I'm saying that imo, but virtue of the type of hardware they develop, they will have a ceiling and won't be the absolute winners. However they can have a place. For instance, ion traps would be the perfect candidate for quantum memories (especially qRAM), and photonic plataforms are most suited to be the conduit for communication between nodes in quantum networks. But even in this scenario, the main source of computational power (i.e. the ""processors"") would be superconducting silicon chips.

Anyways, just my thoughts"
2021-06-12 16:54:40,stocks,"Like most people I believe this is a long play. But I am in it for the short term. 

SPACs got killed in Feb-May so DMYI is really undervalued right now. It's sitting at $11 and just yesterday got a price target of $16. I think this is a unique enough company that it will get some good traction by the time the merger happens and the ticker changes to IonQ. I'll most likely sell then, unless it goes ballistic like some of the other recent SPAC mergers (STPK/STEM, IPOE/SOFI, NGA/LEV, etc). The actual company is legit though from the DD I've done. They are definitely one of the main leaders in the field."

2021-06-12 15:00:43,stocks,"No it's not bullshit. Both AI and QC gets insane amounts of R&D funding from investors, but nothing particularly revolutionary ever comes out of it. I'm not going to dox myself, but the company I work for is *forced* against it's will to use a massive chunk of venture capital funds on pointless R&D that could otherwise be used on other things to make the company profitable.

It should be a safe investment in that if the price goes down, it will almost definitely recover and not just go to $0.  It also pays a monthly divvy w/ a high yield.

2021-06-12 14:13:21,stocks,"I‚Äôm confused about the dividend payout ratio. (And thanks for the extra note on sustainability there). Does this mean that they‚Äôre paying more in dividends than they‚Äôre earning through their operations (writing ccs and whatever else)?

2021-06-12 14:17:15,stocks,It‚Äôs return of capital. So any premium they make in excess of the stated yield is considered a return on capital and is not taxable. This reduces your basis and will create a larger taxable event upon the sale of the underlying.
2021-06-12 17:24:36,stocks,"The portfolio loses value because the stocks it owns that go up get sold below market prices due to the call options written on them, but the stocks that go down lose the fund money.

The fund likely pays out all of its covered call premiums as dividends, as the portfolio shrinks over time.

I don't recommend QYLD, because not only does it underperform during unexpected volatility, but it is very tax inefficient as well. QYLD has returned 10.91% the past 5 years, whereas VOO(Vanguard Sp500) has returned 16.26%"

2021-06-12 14:25:52,stocks,"That‚Äôs fair, I only chose this because it was being suggested by several people in the mentioned subreddit, I do agree that there are way better alternatives"
2021-06-12 14:25:48,stocks,"Agree, except that I think you mean they‚Äôre making LESS premium than stated yield, right? If they‚Äôre making premium in excess of stated yield then no part of the div would be a return of capital.

So I understand the accounting/tax characterization, but if they keep this up, aren‚Äôt they just going to run out of money? And shouldn‚Äôt the price per share theoretically be dropping in conjunction with the return of capital (unless the underlying stocks are going up which could offset that). 

I guess I‚Äôm just confused about why they‚Äôd do that...pay divs in excess of earnings...ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What‚Äôs their endgame here if they continue taking that approach?"
2021-06-12 19:27:03,stocks,Past returns =/= future performance
2021-06-12 18:45:24,stocks,"It stays fairly flat overtime, the yield on their options are like 3% so if the underlying goes down they keep it all and if it goes up they use the extra yield to buy back the shares. They only ever distribute just under 1% so that extra 2% is to protect the nav. Ultimately it‚Äôs more flat than anything. Because of its ATM options strategy the nav is just slow to rebound after a big market dip. One strategy is in a big dip is to just off load the qyld and then buy QQQ for the run up and then switch it back if you need the income."
2021-06-12 14:49:18,stocks,To my knowledge the premium isn't considered a capital gain. I could be wrong though.
2021-06-12 18:48:14,stocks,Ah I see. Are there concerns in a strong bull market that their contracts will be exercised and will then have to buy back at a higher price? I know they probably don‚Äôt write contracts for all the shares they have.
2021-06-12 14:50:43,stocks,"You‚Äôre correct. The premiums they‚Äôre making by selling CCs are considered normal operating income (not cap gains).

Edit: just noticed your username! Good luck on your CPA exams (if you‚Äôre not already finished)!"
2021-06-12 18:53:10,stocks,Yeah kinda I mean a strong bull market isn‚Äôt a linear line from the bottom left to the upper right. It‚Äôs been around since 2013 and before the 2020 stock market crash it had only lost $1 off its price. We have been in a pretty consistent bull market since then.

But the interesting thing is that if I invest in KO, VZ,BMY myself (all these are BH‚Äôs darlings), I get their dividends.  BH itself doesn‚Äôt pay dividends because Buffet believes that he can invest that money better than I can, which is definitely true. 

However I am hoping to be able to start using dividend income within 10 years or so. I don‚Äôt want to sell my investments to do that. Majority of my portfolio is in index funds but I do have some dividend plays as well (above mentioned three stocks and some oil/energy).  If BH was passing their dividends through to me I would hold that instead.  I could get one A share even. But they don‚Äôt so I would have to sell it to use it which I don‚Äôt want to do - Capital gains will kill me.

Basically sub 3% yield and that is more growth the dividend 3 to 4 is a hybrid, 4+ is more a pure dividend play."

At the current $18ish price (about $300 million market cap -  they have no debt, only operating leases), that‚Äôs only about 10x EBITDA, which in my own opinion is pretty cheap for a profitable, nationally-recognized company that seems to be just starting to realize its e-commerce potential.

Entity A sells a stock short at $10 a share.  The stock goes down
Entity B then sells a stock short at $9 a share. The stock goes down
Entity C then sells the stock short at $8 a share.  The stock goes down.

A bunch of idiots buy and hold the stock.  The stock goes to $8.50.

After a few months, Entity C figures that they‚Äôre not going to turn a profit and buys stock to close out their positions.  The stock goes to 9.50 after some volatility.

Entity B sees that the stock will hover around 9.50.  They close out their positions and the stock goes to 10.50

Entity C does the same thing.  The stock rises.

If a company gives dividends, then they are basically saying: ""we can't see any way to use our extra cash to grow the company further"". So if a company gives dividends it's actually a sign that the company has peaked and will just coast. 

But then if a company swears off of dividends, refusing to ever give them in order to ""keep growing"", then the stock really no longer has any intrinsic value. The stock is now just a collectible traded on the open market. 

I noticed that some of the biggest companies don't pay out dividends (google and amazon don't). Do you think this is hubris on their part? You can't grow infinitely - there are only a finite number of resources in the universe. Don't you think that at some point a company should admit that it got adequately massive and should now just pay dividends? Or do you think companies should attempt to be in the growth phase forever?"

This is by growth of course, but also profitable operations that generate cash flow. A dividend means the company has balanced its cash flow such that it can grow and pay shareholders. Take CLX for example. They aren‚Äôt a growth company but their share price is still rising with a regular dividend paid (even before the pandemic slicked sales).

Personally I only invest where is growth potential. Waiting for dividends is similar to selling call options in my mind. You‚Äôre giving up time for a set payment in the future. In that time the underlying stock could fall and more than negate the value of the small payment you are waiting for. Balancing time and risk is key to making consistent profits."

It has no bearing on the business being good or bad. 

I will say that American companies tend to stick with a dividend and ALWAYS pay it out, regardless of availability of opportunity. US shareholders get used to the dividends and go up in arms when they get cut or reduced; however, IMO I would way rather have management cut my dividend if they see a golden opportunity and capitalize on it. Capital allocation is hugely important for the running of a business and I would think a long term holder would be okay with those cuts in the dividend for the sake of the security/growth of the business"

2021-06-12 03:13:54,stocks,Commodities tend to do well in increased inflational periods. I think that tech still has room to grow in the next couple months but the cycle seems to be topping off. Value investing always works in the long run.
2021-06-12 10:09:02,stocks,Globally diversified portfolio would be your best bet. Forget trying to time sectors‚Ä¶ fool‚Äôs game.
2021-06-12 04:15:13,stocks,"If you want growth, you can have plenty in the growth/small cap tech sector. EV/SOLAR/CLOUD/ETC. Get ready for some wild volatility tho. I am personally buying into solar right now, SOL looks great and I see some rotation into the solar sector now"
2021-06-12 10:47:57,stocks,"I am bullish on tech companies that bring in a lot of money and have been mostly consolidating this year, such as Apple, Microsoft, and especially Amazon."
2021-06-12 13:15:21,stocks,"I‚Äôve been building my positions on numerous video game companies the past few years as I believe that they will become a dominant form of entertainment over the next 10-15 years.  

They‚Äôre currently great investments regardless because of EPS but there‚Äôs a bigger future for them with E-sports, streaming and TV/movies I think (as well as merchandising).  

I hold substantial positions in TTWO, EA, NTDOY, ATVI, MSFT, and TCEHY and I‚Äôm interested in RBLX but it hasn‚Äôt hit my entry level (thinking $60 per share is reasonable).

I imagine a day not too far away where there will be Super Bowl level events for gaming."
2021-06-12 05:15:54,stocks,Unpopular choice - gas & oil pipelines.  My pipeline stocks are beginning to move up.  With Covid finishing up people are starting to drive around again.   EV is the future.  Oil is here now.
2021-06-12 08:49:59,stocks,Cannabis stocks
2021-06-12 07:36:29,stocks,Uranium. come checkout  r/UraniumSqueeze  Get in position before July.
2021-06-12 07:39:55,stocks,AAPL has been pretty flat since dropping from it's high so I'd get in on that before the next bull run. I also like AMZN and TSLA long term. ABNB I think I has a lot of upside potential in the next few months as a swing trade
2021-06-12 04:13:32,stocks,"Personally I have diversified my portfolio by having about 60% blue chip div stocks and 40% growth stocks. I'm really bullish on AI and IoT, esp is here to stay as we have all kind of smart products that are connected with literally everything."
2021-06-12 08:33:59,stocks,Mosfet based devices are finally starting to take off in a mass market sort of way rather then being a niche device.  Buy Mosfet manufacturers.
2021-06-12 10:29:03,stocks,Memes
2021-06-12 14:37:07,stocks,"Reit and fintech! 
Not financial advise."
2021-06-12 15:27:40,stocks,"This is what I've noticed in the last month. But please do your research before blindly following my suggestions.   


5G (LAM, Ichor, Appied Materials) will do well - hype is present

Semiconductors (NVDIA, AMD, TSM and Qualcomm for dividends) look solid

Cloud is on a rebound, but still risky. 

Fintech looks solid if you stick with JPM, Shift4, Square. 

Cannabis, get out. It's far too risky.   


Big Tech, can't go wrong with those. 

Autonomous vehicles are too expensive (Tesla), don't believe in self-driving hype. But Lumiar specializes in lidar tech that is used for self-driving cars. So given it's a hype stock, I invested some shares just to capitalize on the gains. Plus, Luminar poached execs from Intel and Tesla. 

Fitness stocks like YETI, Garmin, Nautilus are great. Planet Fitness looks solid, but currently in a sell state. Under Armor expected to grow, Nike good for dividends. Lululemon is too expensive to hold. 

China is a long term play, but it's not doing hot atm. 

3 growth stocks I believe will rebound further are AirBNB, Fiverr, Etsy. But that's my opinion."
2021-06-12 17:56:02,stocks,"I have alot in weed, they have reputation for being high growth."
2021-06-12 05:10:37,stocks,Renewable energy
2021-06-12 09:39:26,stocks,"Check out SRNE huge pipeline and should be an easy 4x-8x gainer the next couple years! I‚Äôve got 24,500 shares at about a $7 average"
2021-06-12 09:14:08,stocks,"If you‚Äôre willing to be a bit speculative, cannabis. Also renewable energy stocks such as Canadian solar, future fuel, renewable energy group. Even gambling, such as SciPlay"
2021-06-12 03:01:41,stocks,"maybe, hotels, resorts, and airlines may see a massive comeback in the coming year(s), obviously, due to the plausible effects of COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and herd immunity.

this isn‚Äôt based on any fundamentals or other kinds of analysis; this is solely speculative, and not financial advice."
2021-06-12 06:50:26,stocks,Junior miners. Check out LODE.
2021-06-12 08:03:56,stocks,"¬£AMGO 
Huge potential, worth at least a small chip in. 
Short and long term."
2021-06-12 08:52:52,stocks,"See a lot about tech, and while I love me some tech it's been running for 2+ years and the S&P is heavily weighted in it. Many institutional portfolios are tilting towards cyclicals, sm and mid cap, international emerging rn due to the rubber band effect of economy bounce back. Specifically equities, I'm looking at LAC and DM as two growth companies over the next 2 - 7 years.

Edit: 1-3 year TH, watching MESA for a significant rebound once travel gets running again"
2021-06-12 09:21:21,stocks,"Cannabis, AI"
2021-06-12 09:40:49,stocks,"IMO, the digital gambling space. So stocks like DKNG, PENN, FLTR. As legalization occurs in more states, revenue is going to increase massively. 

Definitely keep an eye out for FanDuel if it goes public as well.

I'm also very bullish on the 3d printing industry in the next few years."
2021-06-12 12:26:37,stocks,eVTOL. I believe by 2024 that's when most of them are gonna start doing business.
2021-06-12 12:45:54,stocks,Put it all on chip makers
2021-06-12 14:30:02,stocks,Energy both old and new is pretty solid. I had a lot of oil stocks before COVID and now starting to cycle back into now that travel is expanding
2021-06-12 16:01:29,stocks,Psychedelic
2021-06-12 16:40:57,stocks,Healthcare
2021-06-12 16:45:25,stocks,FIGS
2021-06-12 17:03:50,stocks,I like a name like GSK in this environment. Value + healthy divi + catalysts (thanks Elliot). Seems to check the boxes to navigate the current index wide indigestion.
2021-06-12 17:52:42,stocks,$PDX. 25% growth opportunity and plenty of cash on hand.
2021-06-12 17:59:29,stocks,"Livent, evgo, clov, burgerfi, ferroglobe"
2021-06-12 09:31:26,stocks,I heard Movie and Gaming industries might be good sectors.
2021-06-12 15:32:51,stocks,Marijuana
2021-06-12 19:22:28,stocks,"Cannabis is not a sector. Lol But I know what your asking. I'd look into fintech, digital wallet."
2021-06-12 19:45:18,stocks,Thank you.  I‚Äôve been looking at some places to diversify.  Threw around 5% in silver.  Where do we plant money when inflation is exploding?  I‚Äôve never had any luck with oil.
2021-06-12 10:51:37,stocks,That's a thought I had as well. Probably gonna do some more DD on a few mining companies
2021-06-12 12:36:57,stocks,I agree here. GSM is my play!
2021-06-12 15:44:16,stocks,This!
2021-06-12 03:29:19,stocks,"Yea I'm bullish on tech too.
I've been making some good gains on NIO and I want to invest more into tech but I need to diversify my portfolio first."
2021-06-12 03:17:33,stocks,"I've been looking at commodities too but I'm not sure about inflation anymore.
I'm pretty confident that month over month inflation is going to decrease by the end of the year and that deflation might actually become a bigger issue.
Bottom line though is that I don't think inflation will stick around to keep driving up things like commodities for a very long time."
2021-06-12 10:44:02,stocks,"I'm not really trying to time the market, I'm trying to look ahead and see what has good growth potential over the coming years according to projections now.
I'm planning to hold the investments I make now for years."
2021-06-12 10:50:47,stocks,I have been keeping an eye on Microsoft and apple
2021-06-12 06:12:34,stocks,Came here to say this. One of the few sectors still far below pre-covid levels.
2021-06-12 10:08:05,stocks,Suncor $SU has much potential
2021-06-12 08:45:01,stocks,"Also, wouldn‚Äôt oil do well with high inflation?
Oil prices can keep climbing yet I still have to fill up my car just the same to commute to work"
2021-06-12 12:36:03,stocks,"TELL, is my play for this choice, I don‚Äôt care about popular I am here to make money, and TELL is a 10 bagger ticket."
2021-06-12 09:27:20,stocks,Oil is my biggest sector.
2021-06-12 09:54:14,stocks,I am big on oil as well
2021-06-12 04:33:45,stocks,Al looks interesting? Can you Tell me more about Company? Whats is lot? Couldnt find with that ticker
2021-06-12 10:23:50,stocks,Tell that to my ICLN LEAPs that are down like 60% since I bought in Feb üò¢
2021-06-12 10:11:29,stocks,Feel like renewable energy is pure speculation until it is much more massed produced and implemented
2021-06-12 13:16:20,stocks,"Gas and oil should return to pre Covid prices

Inflation could boost them even more"
2021-06-12 03:05:35,stocks,"Be careful though, the recovery is already priced in and for some stocks it‚Äôs already too late‚Ä¶."
2021-06-12 03:08:38,stocks,"I agree that the travel and tourism industry is going to benefit from covid going away slowly but surely, but my issue is that I still see covid as a big risk with variants of the virus threatening to put us back in quarantine. 

I also don't think that even with covid dying out completely, this sector would be what I'd want to put my money in.
The reason for that is, it's likely that a lot of news about reopening is already priced in and most companies are going to have negative cash flows for the next 2-5 years."
2021-06-12 11:02:15,stocks,"Most will have a gold aspect ...and that's fine but the big coming demand is for the stuff for EV batteries... Lithium, cobalt, nickel (especially nickel)... And if course copper. 

Other than general ETFs... An individual company like MP materials is interesting. They're a rare minerals company."
2021-06-12 16:29:03,stocks,"20 $4 calls I basically got for free on GSM two months ago.  That one will move.  Brexit combined with a couple years ago materials bust drove it into the ground.

I also bought lots of $1.50 in MUX thinking their copper holding had been valued at about 1/3 today‚Äôs price.  I saw a rotation into minerals/metals and etc it‚Äôs just taken more months than I anticipated.  

Those moves you beleive in sometimes are farther down the pipe than you think.  Keep believing in your conviction plays.  The market sometimes moves slower into trends than you‚Äôd anticipate."
2021-06-12 08:10:57,stocks,"So do you want to diversify or load up on what's most likely to outperform? Because those are two different goals. Diversity means having unrelated investments who's performance is not correlated

If you think tech is going to outperform, you should be adding staples, energy, and utilities as they are not correlated to tech"

2021-06-12 10:47:27,stocks,"Any surface level analysis you are doing to identify these sectors will already be priced in. High growth potential? High valuation. 

My point is trying to time when to be long certain specific sectors is a fool‚Äôs game. Investing in a globally diversified portfolio has the highest probability of long-term compound growth over decades."
2021-06-12 15:31:18,stocks,"CVE, CNQ, BTE, CPG.  I think all of these will do great in addition to SU.  BTE 100% so far and I'm not even considering selling. 

 Just research the free cash flow these stocks make compared to market capital.  They do have some debt but with oil prices like this it will not be an issue and these companies may offer buy backs with stocks being undervalued."
2021-06-12 15:33:28,stocks,"> don‚Äôt care about popular I am here to make money, 

Exactly."
2021-06-12 11:03:00,stocks,What are you holding there?
2021-06-12 04:58:06,stocks,I mean artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT). A couple of companies I like are for instance Cisco and Qualcomm :).
2021-06-12 03:23:34,stocks,Many are already above pre-covid dips
2021-06-12 03:09:07,stocks,"yeah, that‚Äôs what i was thinking while i was writing it, but, since stock performance is somewhat driven by the psychology of the masses + more people actively investing with apps (like Robinhood and Public), there may be a time of overvalue"
2021-06-12 08:46:34,stocks,"Yeah, Southwest Airlines is now priced higher than before Covid despite them taking on debt for example, and subjectively it still seems like there‚Äôs not as many flights being offered as pre Covid times"
2021-06-12 16:36:32,stocks,"So much catalysts for GSM, plus I love how their product is being used for EV batteries and solar panels which I see being relevant for many years to come.

2021-06-12 10:50:15,stocks,"Ah gotcha, yea you make a good point.
I'm just gonna add to what has been doing well for me and is looking like it will continue to do well for me and I'll add some companies with good fundamentals from each of the biggest sectors."
2021-06-12 17:24:30,stocks,"Fantastic, thanks for this."
2021-06-12 11:04:17,stocks,"Xom, cvx, rds.b."
2021-06-12 03:20:36,stocks,"Yes and no ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs also driven by lots of long term and short term investors who buy at historical lows and then push up prices. 
Take LYV for example, events are only slowly starting up, but Live Nation is at all time high. 
The cruise sector, on the other hand, still has a long way to go - but it‚Äôs also uncertain how travelers will think of cruises post Covid."
2021-06-12 19:30:58,stocks,"And the same guy said ""buy a broad index fund unless you know exactly what you're doing"". So tell me, what kind of economics degree do you hold?



90% broad index funds keeps your money safe and growing over time. Use 10% for *undervalued companies with good fundamentals* rather then random yolos. If you'd do your DD right you'll still be set for life within a decade. Or chase meme stocks, get broke and work at McDonalds until retirement"
2021-06-12 10:56:29,stocks,"Careful not to put too much weight on past performance. It is often not a great predictor of future performance. Set a target asset allocation and rebalance regularly (I do quarterly). 

I do like investing in specific stocks but that is only 25% of my portfolio. The rest is index funds/etfs with low expense ratios."
2021-06-12 11:45:17,stocks,Thank you.
2021-06-12 19:43:07,stocks,"What economics degree do you hold? I was just saying something that adds onto what you said, it looks like you're taking it as a sleight when I was literally just adding onto this:

>So do you want to diversify or load up on what's most likely to outperform? Because those are two different goals.

Ad hominem isn't necessary"
2021-06-12 16:37:11,stocks,Quarterly rebalance sounds like overkill.
2021-06-12 11:54:39,stocks,No problem. I see oil being a good investment and am holding long. May the stocks treat you well if you invest.

if you want a safer way to be a degenerate, then buy FNGU or TQQQ or something - 3x leverage on the biggest stocks in the market (Apple, Amazon, etc). that way at least you're just buying shares that dont expire"
2021-06-12 01:13:39,stocks,"Oh noes, a fallen WSB brother... :(

On topic tho: if you have 300 to invest, I dont think you should work with options as its imo too risky. You prob have enough for only 1 or 2 contracts and generally options expire worthless (esp the cheaper OTM ones).

I get the thrill of possibly making x00% return on a small investment but I would drop the money first in some stocks that at least hold value past a given date. Depending on your risk tolerance you could go for a dividend or a growth stock, I guess because you talk about options you are looking for some excitement. I guess you're best shot would be a growth stock"

2021-06-12 01:54:21,stocks,"Mimedx is developing a micronized injectable amniotic therapeutic biologic treatment for musculoskeletal conditions such as knee osteoarthritis.  The Amniofix Injectable product has shown great promise in earlier studies and a Phase III study for the treatment of plantar fasciitis along with a Phase IIb study for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis just recently concluded. The company has announced that data from these studies will be released in late summer, prior to the expiration of the September calls. Also, Mimedx is being added to the Russell 2000, Russell 3000 and Russell Micro-cap Indexes by the end of the month which will creat demand for shares of the company. 

Exact Sciences is working on a blood based multi-cancer screening test and believes it has the ability to bring the best test to the market, which in the US is estimated to be at least $25 billion annually. They have an amazing team and unmatched resources in place to accomplish this goal. There will be many preliminary data readouts on this and other tests under development to serve as catalysts over the next six or seven months. 

Due your own diligence. It is fun and interesting to actually learn about the companies you are invested in. I am heavily invested in Exact Sciences because I believe in their science and products. I have already taken their Cologuard colorectal cancer screening test twice and am a big fan!  I have spoken with individuals who have used Minedx's Amniofix Injectable product on their knees and it has changed their lives for the better, enabling them to avoid having to have their knees replaced!

2021-06-12 02:19:31,stocks,"Yes. Activist investor Prescience Point Capital Mgt owns about 8% of the company and has a downloadable research report on their website which is a great read. They believe the stock is currently worth about $30/share which would be almost a triple from where we are right now. I have been invested for several years in this company and have amassed a very large position well into 7 figures. Although I have sizable long-term capital gains, I continue to hold for what I feel will be much higher prices in the future. There really is no good treatment for knee osteoarthritis at this time (or hip oa, torn rotator cuffs, tennis elbow, etc) and Amniofix Injectable holds great promise to address a huge market both in the US and globally.

I am a long term investor and believe Mimedx could easily trade for many multiples of its current price ($11) in three years. Similarly, I have been invested in Exact Sciences since single digits and that stock is currently trading north of $120.  I continue to hold Exact Sciences as I feel that stock could easily double over the next two-three years."

2021-06-12 00:17:02,stocks,I believe you can do fractional shares on fidelity. I‚Äôve heard stories about people having to wait an extended period when selling individual stocks on Vanguard. I personally use TD and enjoy it but wish I could do fractional shares on it

2021-06-12 00:00:00,stocks,"""Nobody Ever Went Broke Taking Profits"" - A personal experience I wanted to share with you an experience that I had today. This happens to me all too often. I guess I am not a good trader, but you can **learn from my mistakes**.

Today I bought ORPH in premarket at a ""good"" entry price. I held through open, through the halts, and watched my unrealized gains accumulate. At the highest point I was **up 65%**. I could have taken profits. I could have taken some off... **I got greedy, or hopeful, or whatever**...

I thought it could go higher... **I held**.

I held on the way down all day long, waiting for a reversal that never came. I am now **down 5%**. I know some other people have lost a lot more than me, but it really hit me hard because I really could have used some gains for a change. It's made a bit worse because I was up almost all day. And I just kept hoping for a reversal, despite the **obvious downtrend and loss of volume**.

If someone can learn something from my mistake, I don't mind some of you making fun of me. A winning trade can easily turn into a losing trade.

Remember: **""Nobody ever went broke taking profit.""**

Thank you! Good luck to you all."
2021-06-11 21:20:30,stocks,The professional way to handle quick jumps is to sell into the rally. 10-20-30% done thanks for the easy money good bye suckers. 20% return in a day is a gift.

2021-06-12 00:13:59,stocks,Always have a plan. Otherwise you will be stuck with indecision paralysis.
2021-06-12 04:03:17,stocks,"Okay since this is about trading let me give you a tip that will help you a lot in the future.

""Do not ever let a winning trade turn into a losing trade"".

So you were up 65%. You didn't take profits. It started going down. No big deal. Happens all the time. In such a situation, where your profitable trade completely reverses, you should always cut the trade at or slightly above your original purchase price. This way although you didn't gain any profits, you atleast protected your original capital. Which is the most important thing.

From this day on, consider it a grave sin to let a profitable trade turn into a loss making trade.

You will not under any circumstances ever let this happen again.

Yes you could or should have taken 50% off the profit and let the rest remain but shit happens. Its okay."
2021-06-11 23:37:18,stocks,"That's one anecdote, but here's another.  I've learned over the years to be disciplined and have a plan involving desired exit price, time, catalysts and events.  From years of institutional investing where 10% was considered a good year, the moves we're seeing these days are something I know is once in a generation and I'm aware could end.  

I had a rather sizeable gaming retailer stake averaged around 12, and sold it when it rapidly surged to $20.  67% short term gains more than exceeds my trading threshold.  

But had I held just a month or so longer, it would have vaulted me into the 8 figure club.  Anecdotally, ""nobody ever went broke taking a profit"" isn't always the best.  Still, I'm a believer in get rich slow strategies over get rich quick schemes."
2021-06-11 21:31:11,stocks,I took profits once and the next day a bird shat on my head. Never take profits
2021-06-11 20:42:27,stocks,"Actually traders go broke all the time taking profits.  You have to consider you will be making a long string of trades.  Some will be winners.  Some will be losers.  If you don't make enough on your winners to offset your losers, you go broke.  It is easy to take smaller profits on your winners than what was possible and end up with not enough to offset your losers."
2021-06-11 20:00:13,stocks,"Reminder that there are no ""profits"" or ""losses."" It's not that abstract. There are objective, empirical benchmarks for profit taking or loss cutting. It's not abstract. If you're daytrading, there are specific signals and percents at which you take profit or cut loss. If you're investing, there are specific Fair Market Value price targets which you think a stock should trade at. Stick with your analysis, end of. It's all good OP, everyone has to learn this lesson, including the most disciplined investors.

2021-06-11 20:41:46,stocks,"My new strategy that has been working with my day trading stocks is if a stock goes up 50% I cash out 50% of my initial investment so $100 investment for example goes to $150 I cash out $50 and still have my $100 worth. Alternatively, if it goes up 100% quickly I take the initial investment out and watch what the profit does. If it is steadily rising like 5%-10% per day I will take profits as it rises until I have recouped my initial investment and the rest I leave in and it's straight profit. I do have some long term stocks that I hold but for short term picks this simple strategy has worked pretty well"
2021-06-11 20:57:56,stocks,True. You won't go broke taking profits... But you also won't become wealthy panic selling your winners
2021-06-11 21:39:43,stocks,"Day trading without a profit taking plan usually results in this sort of stuff 

Take 1/3 at 5%, move stop to break even

Guarantee you get a profit of at least 5% and you will typically ride it to the top. Did this with AMC and all the meme stocks on their big up days and what I use when day trading. Worst case you get the 5% profit and you can always buy back in and set it at 3% again.
2021-06-11 20:42:06,stocks,"Honestly think ""nobody ever went broke taking profit"" is terrible advice.

The entire concept of ""taking profit"" implies you don't understand how to valuate a company.  If you understand the company, then you would have a thesis and a price target for a future date.  As new information comes out, you'd adjust your expectations accordingly, and you'd sell when the SP hit your target.

""Taking profit"" suggests you have no idea whether the stock should continue to grow based on its fundamentals (i.e. you never really understood the fundamentals in the first place)."

2021-06-12 11:33:16,stocks,"Set some trigger sells.

Let‚Äôs say you bought 600 shares and it jumped up 65%? Set some trigger sells for a portion of the shares, maybe 200? Maybe 400?, to go when it drops back down to +45%, you don‚Äôt lose ALL of your gains and if it still has traction to get back up? You have some shares in corner and maybe you already pulled out your initial investment.

If you feel it at that point? Set a trigger buy when/if it drops even lower, if you still believe in the fundamentals and it ‚Äúshould‚Äù go back up again. Understanding the fundamentals is key though, that takes you from gambling to being a day trader.

There‚Äôs nothing with doing that."

2021-06-12 18:10:14,stocks,"True, but it's not just about day trading.

Personally, I adjust the size of my position based on my confidence level that it is still undervalued. So I set a price target, which I update as new information comes in, and adjust the size of the position based on the price.

So for example, maybe my initial buy in is 1% of my portfolio. If the price then drops by 5% without any information that changes my valuation, I expand the to 2%. It drops another 5%, maybe I expand to 3%. But if the price then recovers, I drop to 2% again.

I've had a lot of luck with this strategy. One stock it paid off really well on was Lumen Technologies. I started buying in between $10-11, then it dropped below $9 so I significantly expanded my position as I was confident it was undervalued given their earnings, industry, and dividend. Then in January the price randomly spiked to $15 in like 2 days on no news, so I sold. I then bought back in around $12 or so and rode another wave up to $14 before selling again.


 I think the reason most daytraders lose money is because they day trade on stocks they won't be comfortable holding the bag on long term, and focus more on technicals than fundamentals.

I don't consider myself a ""daytrader"", but I do take an active role to investing."

If you're consistently getting stopped out, you can reevaluate if you have your strategy right, but just because you were up initially, then took a loss, doesn't mean your strategy is wrong. Stick to your rulebook no matter what.

Same goes for stocks that go parabolic. If your strategy is to take profit at 10% and it goes 3000%, so what. You took your profit and made money. With every increased %, there's increased risk. Play probabilities, and never lose sleep over missed money."

2021-06-12 00:04:25,stocks,"> Honestly do most average people understand how to value companies? 

Most average people generate less alpha than a passive S&P500 investment.  Hedge Funds and professional investors have price targets (or at least target price ranges if it's is a long-term hold).

A basic method for developing a price target is to first develop a EBITDA target and then give it a p/e multiple that matches the industry average.

> The biggest money makers over the last few years are companies that most rationale people say are extremely over valued, tesla being the biggest example.

On a P/E basis it's way overvalued *today*, but if you believe they'll take 30+ % of the EV market (as some people do) and that they'll be a global leader in battery production (a foundational technology for the next-gen energy sector) then it's not hard to reach an EBITDA estimate the justifies a $700B+ market cap for Tesla in the future.

Personally, I'm steering clear of the auto OEMs, because I regard their future as too uncertain."

False. 

Take a look at [PLL](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=PLL&theme=dark) on September 28th - the day they announced a lithium off-take deal with Tesla (the fundamental event driving the surge).  Stock climbed over 400% in day.  If you sold at 60% you would have lost a *lot* of money.  Even if you sold at the top, you'd have lost out in the long-run (unless you bought back in after the retrace).

I reiterate, if you truly understand the company, you won't take profit based on a growth percentage.  You'll sell when it hits your target."

2021-06-12 02:03:48,stocks,How do you not?  I'm not going to explain what gambling is.
2021-06-12 13:20:50,stocks,"Yeah, I honestly think they‚Äôre really tryna get the Nasdaq to hit another high before letting it correct. I‚Äôd say start getting some put options since we‚Äôre close to the top."
2021-06-11 21:40:53,stocks,Indeed. It‚Äôs collective insanity. I think these people really believe in ‚ÄúAMC to 100k‚Äù.
2021-06-12 02:56:18,stocks,"I follow ya. Learned Korean, then filled an Analyst slot for Afghanistan. Definitely learned a lot. I enjoyed the analysis far more than translation/transcription."
2021-06-12 09:57:38,stocks,The big crash in 1987.  New investor at the time and wanted to get out of the market.  Hung tough instead and realized even the worst crashes recover and in less than six months bounced back higher.
2021-06-12 14:32:03,stocks,"No, you're right, there's definitely something to be learned from this one day trader's one position in one stock on one particular day.  There's gotta be. Otherwise, a stock chart would just be a wild, unpredictable squiggle, beyond the comprehension of any individual. And we can't go around thinking \*that\*. Surely this thing is predictable and can be made to print money, if only I studied this chart a bit mooooooore.

Here, let me rephrase the OP for you:

My stuff went up, and I liked that. Then my stuff went down and I didn't like that. I wish only the first part happened and not the second. That would be better."
2021-06-11 21:28:00,stocks,Both posts are really great advice üëç
2021-06-11 22:33:45,stocks,"No, this was today. In premarket. It hit 16 after the open, I got greedy, or hopeful, or both."
2021-06-12 02:07:17,stocks,"Look, all I‚Äôm saying is a lot of trading involves risks and I think it‚Äôs silly that a lot of people on Reddit, whenever a trade goes bad, like to label it as pure gambling. OP said that he got greedy. Fine. That‚Äôs a normal pitfall. But if he got out at the top I don‚Äôt think many of us would call it gambling. It‚Äôs only conveniently gambling once we can see in hindsight that it didn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôm not trying to be rude or start a fight. I‚Äôm just saying that I think people can be unnecessarily harsh when things go south"
2021-06-11 21:47:56,stocks,"Well, until both of those stocks absolutely tank to the bottom, I don‚Äôt see it ending.  GME hasn‚Äôt been under 100 bucks in months and I‚Äôm old enough to remember when buying AMC at 15 would create bagholders for life."
2021-06-12 10:12:23,stocks,"Reflected a bit, and counting Covid, I've held through four ""catastrophic"" crashes.  Obviously you have to hold good stocks.  During the dot com crash I got caught holding Nortel, I believe to this day one of the most notorious meltdown stocks of all time.  Held it till it was literally a penny (stupid!), then kept it in my portfolio as a reminder to never be stupid again....still trying."
2021-06-12 14:46:13,stocks,Refer to my earlier post.  Employ a -10 percent stop when you‚Äôre way up to preserve some gains‚Ä¶
2021-06-12 02:14:56,stocks,"I called it gambling because getting greedy is a gambler fallacy called ""hot hand fallacy"", and therefore he was gambling.  He should've exited earlier, because he had no fundamental reason why the stock should be rising.  His second fallacy was, well I don't know the name for it, but it's where you keep holding, just hoping it will come back without a fundamental reason on why it should.

As far as day trading it's an arbitrary rule in my viewpoint.  Nothing makes that rule better or worse then the others.  It just shifts the chance somewhere else but isn't based on any fundamental reason that I understand.

I didn't think you were trying to start a fight.  I cannot always tell people's exact intent though.  I thought you might have just been trying to be pedantic, but it's alright.  It's just internet beeps and boops.  ü§ó"
2021-06-11 21:51:52,stocks,"I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see GME dropping that far any time soon, to be honest. The company has consolidated both financially and in terms of leadership, has a huge and loyal following, and it‚Äôll likely shrug off this SEC probe and complete the share offering with no impact to the share price. AMC, on the other hand, is more likely to just go tits up."
2021-06-12 10:52:59,stocks,"Oh, I see. I'll look into it more. I am one of those people who started learning about investments last summer (though I was keeping track of few companies I knew, specifically actiblizzard crash 80->40 USD for a few years now). And for the 1987 crash, I was born 9 years AFTER the crash.

Though lesson learnt from you, invest small amounts of ""gamble money"" into unreliable stocks that will go either to moon or bankrupt, crashes don't take long at all to bounce back, within same year to few years on average, don't panic and buy more if possible during those situations"
2021-06-12 02:30:19,stocks,">but it's where you keep holding, just hoping it will come back without a fundamental reason on why it should.

Sunk cost? ""I've risked so much, it's all wasted if I fail now.""

Been there."
2021-06-12 02:22:10,stocks,Understandable. Always appreciate rational discourse. I see your point of view. All good!
2021-06-11 22:07:52,stocks,Yeah it‚Äôs weird. Have had a position in UWM for a while and now it‚Äôs jumping up and the WSB/Stocktwits crowd is starting to pump it up.  I was planning on holding this one for a while but now I have to take in account if this thing pulls a Clover or something where I would be stupid not to lock in profits.  But then you also have to figure out the floor of a stock after a pump like that.  Had the same problem with AHT. Bought into it in the 2‚Äôs looking for a cheap REIT that hadn‚Äôt risen yet and then it shot to the 7s outta nowhere.  Now I am just waiting to buy back in
2021-06-12 11:35:09,stocks,Yep. ‚ÄúSunk Cost Fallacy‚Äù.
2021-06-12 14:26:29,stocks,Same here. I‚Äôm thinking about getting into covered calls for the first time with my shares. I‚Äôm thinking with the current ape mentality that you could sell a call at a ridiculous strike point and one of these nuts will buy it simply for the karma on the subsequent ‚ÄúAM I DOING THIS RIGHT??‚Äù post.
2021-06-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 14th, 2021 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 14th, 2021.

# **Markets await the Fed‚Äôs meeting before making the next big move in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/11/markets-await-the-feds-meeting-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Stocks could trade sideways as investors await the outcome of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs June meeting next Wednesday afternoon.
*****
> The Fed‚Äôs two-day meeting is the big event for markets in the week ahead. Although the central bank is not expected to take any action, it could make tweaks to its forecasts for interest rates and inflation that market pros say could be market moving.
*****
> Stocks meandered Friday and the S&P 500 finished at a new high, garnering a 0.4% gain for the week.
*****
> ‚ÄúMarkets have to get past Wednesday before anyone makes huge bets,‚Äù said Scott Redler, chief strategic officer at T3Live.com. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really that the Street‚Äôs looking at the next big obstacle ‚Äî which is the Fed.‚Äù
*****
> The market is attuned to any discussion about the central bank‚Äôs bond-buying program. The program was initiated during the pandemic to provide liquidity to the markets and keep interest rates low. The Fed is widely expected to acknowledge it will start tapering back on that so-called quantitative easing program later this year.
*****
> Once the central bank signals it will cut back on its $120 billion monthly bond purchases, it is basically signaling a major shift in its policy from easing to tightening. The Fed is expected to signal a taper well before it takes any action, and its own forecast for interest rates does not show any increases through 2023.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell briefs journalists after the central bank issues its statement at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday. He is expected to sound dovish and assure markets the Fed‚Äôs policy will remain easy .
*****
> ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say for some reason Powell intimates tapering could happen late this year, not just talk about it but do it,‚Äù said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. ‚ÄúThat would spook the market, or if we get a big increase in inflation projections that would get the markets a little spooked.‚Äù
*****
> # Economic calendar
> There are a few economic reports worth watching, particularly Tuesday‚Äôs retail sales for May and the producer price index ‚Äî a look at producer level inflation.
*****
> The Federal Reserve will also release its industrial production index data, which measures production and capacity in manufacturing, mining and other industries, on Tuesday.
*****
> ‚ÄúEssentially, I think nominal retail sales might be strong,‚Äù said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies. ‚ÄúI just think the only thing that thing the market cares about right now is employment because that‚Äôs the only thing that can move the needle on the Fed.‚Äù
*****
> The markets this past week shrugged off a super hot consumer inflation reading for May, reported Thursday. Economists said the 5% jump in the consumer price index appears to be a temporary reaction to the reopening economy, supply chain disruptions and pent-up demand. But they also said it will take a few more reports to make sure it is not more persistent than the Fed currently expects.
*****
> The central bank has said it expects inflation to be high for a short period before falling back down, closer to 2%. The Fed will likely raise its forecast of 2.2% for this year, given the jump in recent inflation readings.
*****
> It also predicts that core inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, will be at 2% in 2022 and 2.1% in 2023.
*****
> Wells Fargo‚Äôs Schumacher said he is closely watching that inflation forecast, particularly for 2023. According to the Fed‚Äôs interest rate forecast, that is also the first time a group of central bank officials see the potential for an increase in the fed funds target rate.
*****
> So if inflation is higher in their view, the outlook for interest rates could be as well. That could move forward the forecast for the first rate hike, now forecast by a majority of the Fed in 2024.
*****
> ‚ÄúIf that number goes up a tenth, that‚Äôs a non-event. If it goes up 0.3, it‚Äôs a lot in terms of the way the Fed looks at the world,‚Äù Schumacher said. The Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target for a period of time before it acts.
*****
> Markowska of Jefferies doubts the Fed rate forecast will shift. The forecast is presented in a so-called ‚Äúdot plot‚Äù with anonymous entries from central bank officials.
*****
> She noted in March, Federal Open Market Committee participants were split 11 to 7 against a 2023 hike, which means three officials would have to change their mind in order to move the median forecast.
*****
> ‚ÄúMy base case is it won‚Äôt move,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI just feel like there hasn‚Äôt been enough definitive change in the data to really change the Fed‚Äôs forecast. Having said that, you just need three people to change their mind. Even if that median forecast goes up, Powell is just going to downplay it during the press conference.‚Äù
*****
> She pointed to the disappointing May employment report, which showed 559,000 jobs were added, 100,000 less than expected.
*****
> # Watch bonds
> Stocks finished the past week mixed, with the Dow down 0.8% at 34,479, and the S&P 500 eking out a gain of 0.4% to finish the week at a record 4,247. The Nasdaq, boosted by tech, gained nearly 1.9% to reach 14,069. Meanwhile the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed the other indices, increasing by 2.2% for the week and landing at 2,335.
*****
> REITs were the best performing major sector for the week, up 2%, followed by the health care sector‚Äôs 1.9% gain. Consumer discretionary stocks rose 1.6%. Tech climbed 1.4%, helped by a decline in interest rates.
*****
> But the financial sector lost 2.4% as interest rates fell, and it was the worst performing sector this week. Financials fell with other cyclicals, like materials, off 2% for the week and industrials off 1.7%.
*****
> Meme stocks remained in the headlines and continued to trade with a high level of volatility. GameStop hit a high of $344.66 Tuesday and dropped as low as $206.13 Friday before closing at $233.34 per share.
*****
> Besides the wild ride by meme stocks in the past week, the market to watch was Treasurys, as yields took a surprising slide. There was a fairly dramatic move in the rate of the benchmark 10-year, watched most closely by investors, as it influences mortgages and other important lending rates.
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield dipped under 1.43% on Friday. Yields move opposite price, so the move downward represented a buying surge.
*****
> ‚ÄúI feel like this entire move in Treasurys is technical and has nothing to do with fundamentals,‚Äù said Jefferies‚Äô Markowska. She said institutions are finding super low yields in Treasury bills and the overnight rates markets. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just an excess of cash that is spilling out to the longer maturities,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPeople are still very short.‚Äù
*****
> Markowska said the weaker than expected May jobs report spurred buying that forced some short investors, who bet on higher yields, to cover those positions as rates fell.
*****
> The fall in the 10-year yield, which hit a high of 1.75% in late March, has been a positive for stocks. It also has drawn some stock investors to tech and growth sectors, which had fallen out of favor.
*****
> ‚ÄúMost people in the market will tell you yields will rise significantly at some point. The question is when,‚Äù said Schumacher. Many forecasters expect the 10-year yield to reach 2% by the end of the year.
*****
> Finally, investors will also be watching headlines from President Joe Biden‚Äôs trip to the U.K. and Europe, where he is attending the G-7 and a meeting with NATO allies. He will hold a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday in Geneva.

> # Advance/Decline Lines Support New Highs

> One of our favorite charts to get a quick read on the overall health of the market is a simple comparison of DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 performance to cumulative advance/decline lines. From late October‚Äôs low through mid-February all four indexes moved nicely higher essentially in unison. Advance/decline lines were also all trending higher. It was in mid-February that NASDAQ turned briskly lower. Its advance/decline line also turned lower.

> When NASDAQ turned and its advance/decline began trending lower, DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 essentially went nowhere and traded in a range. Bullishly, it appears NASDAQ‚Äôs advance/decline line appears to have bottomed in mid-May and is on the verge of eclipsing its peak from February. Broad participation across all the major indexes is a bullish sign and is generally indicative of a healthy move higher is underway. S&P 500 closed at a new all-time high today. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are closing in on their respective all-time highs.

> In the near-term, new all-times are likely. However, June is the last month of NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Eight Months‚Äù and historically soon after the start of the second half of the year, around mid-July, markets have stalled out and tended to slip into a sideways to lower trend. Inflation trends and the Fed are two possible catalysts that could clip the market‚Äôs wings this year. Inflation could prove to be more than just transitory and at some point, perhaps sooner than expected, the Fed will likely begin tapering asset purchases.

> # Supply Chain Bottlenecks Push CPI Higher

> Make that two consecutive months that CPI inflation has surprised meaningfully to the upside.

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its May inflation report this morning, June 10, revealing that the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.6% month over month and 5% year over year. The core CPI, which strips out food and energy, rose 0.7% month over month, and 3.8% year over year. Given strong base effects from rolling off weak data from a year ago, we find the month over month data more informative. With that context, more volatile components that are heavily tied to the economic reopening had the largest effects on the monthly increases, most notably prices for used vehicles, airfare, and rental cars.

> We continue to see strong evidence that supply chain bottlenecks paired with a rapid demand rebound are causing major price increases. The most visible example is in used car and truck prices, which surged 7.3% in May following a historic 10% rise in April. The supply of new vehicles is constrained in the near term because of semiconductor chip shortages, and as a result, used cars and trucks are being bid up in the secondary markets. The good news is that we expect these market imbalances to largely resolve themselves with time as supply, which has a longer ramp-up time than demand, recovers.

> ‚ÄúThe inflation outlook has rightfully been top of mind since last month‚Äôs blowout report,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúUnder the hood, though, we think the picture is a bit more sanguine than the headlines would suggest, and still believe inflation will be relatively well-contained over the intermediate-to-long term.‚Äù

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, owners‚Äô equivalent rent of primary residences, a measure of rents for non-rent-controlled residences in urban areas, has bounced off depressed levels. The move thus far, though, is likely best described as returning to the pre-pandemic trend rather than threatening to break away to new heights‚Ä¶for now. This measure is critical for future inflation prospects, as it is one of the largest components of CPI and is considered to be less volatile than other components. Movements observed in the series are, therefore, viewed as more structural in nature and thus have the potential to be ‚Äústickier.‚Äù At the moment, we do not believe that the rent component poses an imminent threat to the broader inflation picture, and is merely displaying an increasing willingness for consumers to rent following a massive shift in preference to own brought on by COVID-19.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.10.21-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

> Market-based measures of inflation expectations have also retreated from their fever pitch last month. 10-year breakeven inflation expectations, derived from the differences in nominal and real Treasury yields, have actually fallen since last month‚Äôs CPI report, not risen. And while we are hesitant to call that the peak in inflation expectations given ongoing bottlenecks in supply chains, there was a distinct air of a ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù dynamic to us.

> Taken altogether, we believe the Federal Reserve (Fed) will view today‚Äôs inflation data generally as confirmation of its preexisting stance that the majority of excess inflationary pressures will be transitory. In a vacuum, despite the headline inflation beat, this likely does little to change the Fed‚Äôs timetable for tapering asset purchases, and the market reaction for now looks to be confirming that view. The coming months will be telling, though, as we are now entering the ‚Äúshow me‚Äù phase of the inflation debate where market participants will be increasingly anxious for the Fed to prove its assertion that higher inflation will be transitory.

> # A Closer Look At New Highs

> The S&P 500 Index is flirting with new highs unlike nearly any time in history. In fact, it has now gone nine days in a row closing within 1% of an all-time high without breaking through. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an old saying about not shorting a dull market. Well, lately it has been about as dull as it gets,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúThe catch is other times that saw long streaks without a new high, yet very close to one, actually didn‚Äôt perform as well as one might expect.‚Äù

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.9.10-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**

> Taking things a step further, the S&P 500 has closed within 0.15% of an all-time high without closing at a new high for three straight days. In the history of the S&P 500, that has only happened one other time, in September 1964. Stocks were flat three months later then and up only 2.6% six month later, so although this is only a sample size of one, a sharp move higher in the near term appears less likely.

> We‚Äôve shared this next chart before, but given we are talking about new highs it is important to point it out again. New highs usually happen in clusters that can last for a decade or more. Given this market has been making new highs since 2013, despite the 2020 bear market, history would suggest there could be several more years before this strong run is done.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.9.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1)**

> Take another look above. This year has a good amount of new highs already and it isn‚Äôt even half way over. In fact, 26 new highs over the first five months of the year is the most for any year during the first five months since 32 new highs in 1998.

> Another angle on this: Should the S&P 500 make a new high in June, it would make a new high every month for the first six months of the year. This rare feat last happened in 2014 and 1986 before that. The rest of the year those years added 5.0% and lost 3.5%, respectively.

> The S&P 500 is only 0.13% away from the last all-time high set back on May 7. Odds do favor another new high will eventually take place, which means this bull market continues. In the LPL Chart of the Day we show that this new bull market is already up 89% in just over a year, giving it one of the best annualized returns ever for a bull market, although bull markets do tend to have strong annualized returns early.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.9.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1)**

> What happens after stocks make new highs? Here‚Äôs a chart we shared last August. The bottom line is investors shouldn‚Äôt be scared of new highs, even though many are scared of heights.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.9.21-Blog-chart-4.png?ssl=1)**

> So there you have it, various looks at new all-time highs. Now we just have to make one!

> # Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months

> S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October.

> We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend.

> # Small Business Pulse Check

> While U.S. economic conditions have certainly improved, and earnings momentum for S&P 500 companies has been strong, U.S. small business conditions remain somewhat less stable. Notably, the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index has improved since last year (99.6 in May, up from the 90.9 low in April 2020), and according to the Federal Reserve, perhaps less than 200,000 U.S. small businesses failed due to the pandemic last year. Both figures are likely better than many had expected during the height of 2020‚Äôs economic stress. However, the aggregate economic foundation of small business in this country probably has a ways to go before it fully recovers. This may create more instability at this point in the recovery than is typically seen. The message here is that while most high-frequency economic data indeed looks good, we should remain mindful of still unstable areas of the economy that may not show up in many data sets.

> Fortunately, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) provides economic and market participants with various survey results that deal with specific elements of small business operation. The NFIB not only surveys optimism, but they also compile data on hiring plans, compensation plans, capex plans, quality of labor, and sales expectations‚Ä¶among other items. Review of these data series indicates to us that there is still work left to do to get U.S. small businesses back on solid footing. As we can see from the LPL Chart of the Day below, business owners remain somewhat hesitant about their capital expenditure plans while hiring plans have trended more firmly with optimism. Still, other data tells us that NFIB survey respondents are cautious as to whether now is a good time to expand their business. Meanwhile, the surveys show that small business owners are indeed having a hard time finding quality labor and the cost of labor is rising, thus making job openings hard to fill.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> ‚ÄúRecent NFIB data tells us that small businesses have gotten off the floor following the pandemic punch, but the black eye on a formidable part of the U.S. economy still lingers. With post-COVID economic re-openings in full swing, we remain hopeful that small businesses will soon recover enough to add that final boost to domestic conditions,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

> While small business conditions will be something to watch carefully through 2021 and into next year, we believe pent-up consumer demand could bode well for many establishments. We are expecting a robust summer traveling season that could have consumers readily opening their wallets. This may translate into further improvements in the NFIB optimism trend, provided that business owners find a solution to their current labor struggles.

2021-06-12 00:00:00,stocks,"How do taxes work in an actively managed ETF? I‚Äôve been holding ARKK and I get their daily emails about the trades they make. I see them trading in and out of stocks like Workhorse over the course of a few months.

If I did that in my taxable brokerage account I‚Äôd have to pay short term capital gains tax. But I also have to pay capital gains tax on ARKK when I sell it.

So are they able to trade in and out of positions without paying capital gains since their shareholders will pay later? If that‚Äôs true then if I sell after holding for over a year do I still pay long term capital gains even though some of the profits were from short term trades?

Or are they also paying taxes on their trades and that‚Äôs somehow factored into the price of the ETF without double taxing their holders?"
2021-06-11 20:55:24,stocks,"i think ARK pays out a dividend at the end of the year for their capital gains. you'd have to pay tax on that

otherwise i think it is treated as any normal ETF and taxed when you sell, based on how long you held

not 100% sure though"
2021-06-11 22:18:56,stocks,"I am not sure that people are answering your question.  The bottom line I think for your question is that ARK is a company (Ark ETF trust or Ark Invest), a financial company that owns and operates funds that you are able to invest in.  They have SEC filings and pay taxes on their income as a company.  They will get favorable tax treatment in many ways and these taxes are not really directly passed on to you as an investor in one of their funds.  The fees they charge for operating, in some sense could because they are charging you for operations and that is part of their income.  Anyway, this is my understanding, but hopefully someone can correct me if I am wrong.

2021-06-11 21:29:27,stocks,"ETF is a type of fund that is traded on an exchange, passive or not, index tracking or not. ARKK is definitely an ETF.

Compare the mutual fund VFIAX versus the ETF VOO. They both track the S&P 500, comprising the same stocks, and are managed in the same way. The difference is about the structure of the fund, not how the stocks within the fund are managed."

For positions I am long in it allows me to offer my shares on loan to shorts. Why this is really compelling is because I am long in UPST and the interest rate is at 50-75% annually.
2021-06-12 11:44:42,stocks,"Read the fine print, but there is no reason as I can see not to do it. The risk is if your broker goes under.

Also if it is a company with dividends, you forgo them, but the interest should be much higher anyway. Also you get taxed higher for interest. You also can‚Äôt vote in company elections."

2021-06-12 11:37:32,stocks,"I don't think anybody has touched on one of the biggest factors. 

The 5% headline is blown out of proportion. It's a 5% yoy (year over year) inflation. Meaning it has risen 5% from may 2020 to may 2021. However, may 2020 was a big hole where everything was shutdown and nobody was spending due to fears of the pandemic. 

If that hole didn't exists, the yoy for may 2021 would be much lower. 

A more accurate representation would be the month over month number. So from April 2021, to may 2021, it has risen only 0.6%. which if consistent for the year is still really high at ~7%, but that number is largely overblown due to used car sales skyrocketing. While the rest of the CPI data is relatively low, with a few areas even experiencing deflation month over month (gasoline was a big one). 

Essentially, the 5% number is a false headline due to the typical calculations being ""manipulated"" by the pandemic. 

In reality, inflation (right now) is not an issue, and once car manufacturing starts up again, the data will fall even more. 

That's isn't to say that real inflation issues won't come later in the year however. Money printing takes time to trickle down to consumers, (which is what the CPI data tracks)."
2021-06-11 21:53:46,stocks,"If the dollar weakens from money printing (inflation), a stock will strengthen relative to the dollar, so you would see the price of a stock increase. Why would the market crash?"

2021-06-12 04:00:18,stocks,Why would more money and/or higher interest rates cause someone to sell stocks?
2021-06-12 04:13:55,stocks,Lower interest rates lead to lower bond yields. Investors have to invest in stocks to get better returns. Printing money and pausing multiple types of loans when everyone is stuck at home and can‚Äôt travel leads to people playing the market. Playing the market too much leads to overvaluation and extreme speculation like we‚Äôre seeing now. Eventually the music stops and everyone has to find a chair.
2021-06-12 15:09:57,stocks,">Why would more money and/or higher interest rates cause someone to sell stocks?

2021-06-12 00:00:00,stocks,"Roblox (RBLX) and music industry lawsuit I've been watching Roblox since it's IPO back in March and considering buying some shares. My daughter plays it quite a bit and I'm very familiar with the app. I'm also a musician (amateur/hobbyist), and quite familiar with the music industry in general and how aggressively they go after copyright violations. In fact, I was really surprised how much copyrighted content I was hearing coming from the games my daughter was playing on Roblox. There's tons of music and sound effects from other video games (even Nintendo) in addition to songs by popular artists. So it came as no surprise to me when I saw this lawsuit pop up in the news. I don't think there's any way they are going to get out of this one. If they try to deny this they are going to lose. They might settle, but no matter what they are going to be forced to implement better content ID on their platform which I assume will require an R&D investment of some sort in addition to any settlement.

Yet I continually hear Cramer say ""and it's a dividend stock"" like it's a plus.  MSFT moves .56 in 5 min most days.  So many ""investor"" gurus talk about dividend reinvestment.  Even if I held say 500 shares, it's still only $280 on an investment of $125,000?

2021-06-12 02:29:10,stocks,"So why when Cramer is talking about the stock, he adds ""and it's a dividend stock"" like it's a good thing when saying Microsoft is a ""Buy""?  Yes if I bought 20 years ago the dividend made sense.  But not now.  A dollar is a dollar.  

Although I see your point, it's the same as saying your bank account paying .8% interest is higher because you started saving back in the 80s so now the 10k I saved then has appreciated so the yield is higher than .8%.  the interest has become negligible is the point.  ""Something is better than nothing"" is not an argument when the sum is so low.  

Thank you for sharing this side of the coin, but I still don't see how a stock below 1% is worth even MENTIONING the dividend.  KO is a totally different story because it is much higher.  But I see at one point it was relevant.  Thank you for that. But right now to buy the stock....

Ok, great I'm an investor.  I have $5,000 to invest in Microsoft.  I decide to do dividend reinvestment.  It would take me 6 years to get even one more share from dividend reinvestment.  And that's if the stock stays where it is ,(which we know it won't).  Most investments have a 10-20 year outlook so it's still negligible.  

I still feel like your point is on par with advocating for a ""high yield savings account"". Which I think we can all agree is a waste of money.  No one is excited about their interest gained on a savings account.  

If I have a cake my point is getting 1 letter of icing is more of a slap in the face because of the concept than a ""wow I sure am excited about this icing"".  Keep your icing Piggly wiggly."

And if they didn't pay dividends and you wanted to cash out some part of it, you could just sell stock. And this is what ultimately makes having dividends for a growth stock meaningless.

The debate is about people claiming that ""so and so stock is great because they offer dividends"", like Cramer adding it as a pro, when in reality it makes no difference for a growth stock investor.

And if a company is offering dividends, it says that you shareholder will be smarter or more profitable with that money than the company itself, so it makes that company at least to me look worse,  they are essentially saying they are out of growth opportunities. But then you go back in anyway with this money even though company telling you that they have too much right now, and can't use it wisely."

2021-06-12 08:11:28,stocks,"I think you're still kind of missing the point. With a normal blue-chip company the stock price grows and the dividend payouts grow, forget about the dividend/yield. The dividend/yield fluctuates. 

In your original post the threshold you thought was pointless was 3%. JPM is at 2.2% right now. It's 3.60 in the last year and it's a $160 stock. But if you bought it in 1989 the stock price was $3.90, round up and say you could get 25 shares for $100. Say you bought 100k worth of JPM in 1989 that would be 25,000 shares- that would now be paying out 90k a year in a dividend, even assuming you were not reinvesting the dividend. 

There are good growth stocks that don't pay dividends, there are good dividend stocks that don't grow. But if you buy a good stock that pays a reasonable (small) dividend, then you hold the stock for a long time, the stock price and dividend payouts grow (in absolute terms) and then in the future you get passive income from the dividend and the principal continue to grow. 

Set the time frame to longer and check out these charts, the dividend yield is noisy, the stock price is noisy but goes up for good companies, and the dividend goes up steadily. Imagine you invested a substantial amount of money in these companies a few decades ago and see why the dividend would then matter.

2021-06-12 01:34:05,stocks,"You don‚Äôt understand the cruise industry. They aren‚Äôt being greedy, they‚Äôre being desperate. They don‚Äôt have dock space to displace their Florida operations that are significantly larger than anywhere else.

They can‚Äôt just dock there ships in other places without significant infrastructure. They‚Äôve got billions of dock infrastructure, customs facilities, and ground transportation invested in Florida.

Galveston and Nola get overwhelmed with 2 ships only docked. Even NYC only has infrastructure in place to handle about 7 large cruise ships per day, but 5 docks those can‚Äôt handle the passenger load of 5 large ships at once. Boston can handle 1 ship on a seasonal basis. Baltimore can handle 1 ship. Charleston can handle 1 ship seasonally.

FLL alone handles 8 ships/day with more support terminals if needed. MIA can handle up to 10 ships and have some of the cruise lines most expensive terminals. Port Canaveral can handle 7 ships. Jacksonville can handle 1. Tampa can dock 2.  So basically the state of Florida on a max day with the correct mix of ships can dock 28 ships/day.

The rest of the gulf coast 5 ships/day.  The rest of the eastern seaboard 10 ships/day and that is being generous. These other ports also have higher operational costs due to distance of travel and dependence on NYC.

They‚Äôre pretty dependent on Florida for over half of their north american operations.

There are other legal and cost barriers at play. There is a law called the Jones Act. They have to hit a foreign port before returning to the US with guests, otherwise they must be a domestic vessel. Florida is valuable, because they can reach the Bahamas with minimal travel. In short, they burn much less fuel per passenger per day.

A ship departing Nola or Galveston has to go all the way Yucat√°n peninsula to fulfill the requirement. If it‚Äôs leaving NYC it has to hit Bermuda or the Bahamas much further away from home port. They‚Äôll still do them, but they can only market them to a number of people effectively and at a higher rate.

So the problem is if the ships are loaded 30% or 50%, they need to stick to either short routes or stick to routes with premium fare payers that will pay more to travel further.

Now the good news, is there is room to cut operational cost when they cut passenger loads, but paying off the fixed cost capital costs of building the ship is more problematic.

Even then the 2 cases they just caught were not on a ship sailing out of Florida, it was home porting in st. Martin."

Though these two cruises cost that much being over a week long and in the middle of August. Though surprisingly off-season cruises can range anywhere from expensive to reasonable to even surprisingly cheap if you know what your doing, and the aforementioned ""cruise enthusiasts"" would definitely know where to look, what to do and where/when to go.  Even then, while a lifestyle like that definitely isn't cheap, if done right it's attainable by regular people who don't have to necessarily be rich, but are willing to adjust their plans for a deal while having both the means and discipline with their spending to save for pre set goals.

Supply constraints from the pandemic are hitting tech companies, especially chip manufacturers which affect the broader tech market.

Also, conveniently ignoring tech stocks with healthy P/E and forward P/E ratios of less than the average S&P 500 index stock in spite of the tech shortage shows that tech is far from dead and is already ingrained in our lives so much that it inevitably becomes a significant factor for the foreseeable future. 

My point throughout this was just to say that would you invest in the leading EUV lithography machine producer (ASML) or would you invest in an industry that has an uncertain future with dead weight in the form of cruises that are currently being maintenance without enough passengers and revenue? Saying that travel will be cheap is a false equivalence; yes airline travel will be cheaper, but cruise lines are supposed to be known for being luxurious.

Since the markets are currently inflated (S&P hovering around 45 PE), I feel that value stocks are the way to go while maintaining a wad of cash on the side. If there is a correction, they will be the least hurt and the cash will allow you to buy into a crash.

Im basically waiting to see what happens. If things correct and earnings return and bring the PE down to earth then cool, ill buy some more.

Some stuff I am looking at:

CPB - Fell on bad Q due to inflation  
KDP - Fell recently for similar reasons

Example:  An investor has used his margin buying power to accumulate shares of Acme Co.  The current maintenance requirement is 50%.  Now a large firm, fund, investor, etc wants to buy cheap shares of Acme- the stock is ready to take off on pending news.  They tell the clearing house to raise the maintenance requirement to 100%.  Now everyone using that clearing house who has a large enough chunk of Acme while at or near max margins, may get a margin call, forcing the sale of hopefully, Acme at whatever the current rate is, which may drop as others liquidate Acme to make their margin call.  Now they can buy up cheaper shares.

[Crash predictions] So, as would seem to always be the case given the commentary online (""bears have predicted the last X of Y crashes,"" where X >> Y), there is no absence of market participants that suspect a correction, bear market, or crash is on the horizon. Nevertheless, such commentary is at times directed toward bearish sentiment in general, even when no explicit predictions are made---vague bearish statements like, ""Feels like a correction is due,"" ""Market is too overvalued,"" etc., but stopping short of making any actual prognosis.

Personally, I am bearish on the market in general, but I anticipate the current bull market could run largely unabated, save for a correction or two, for another year or two or three. My reasons for being bearish have been voiced many times by many people, and consist likely of nothing market watchers haven't already heard a million times over. These include things like references to borrowing on margin, suspicion of bubbles in speculative markets, very high IPO activity, retail madness, and excessive readings in standard means of valuation.

But for a moment, let us just take out the fiscal responsibility part of the equation that demands we be skeptical of our own conclusions, lest we fall victim to silly errors that cost us dearly. For a second, let's stop beating around the bush. Let's eschew all doubt. Let's go all-in. 

Whether a bull, a bear, or something else, I want to see your exact prediction of when the next crash in a market index will occur. **To the day.** In this case, I'll say a market crash is one of either:

1. A market close of any of either the Dow Jones IA, Nasdaq composite, S&P 500, or Russell 2000 **at least 30%** from its all-time high, or

2. A level-3 circuit breaker event.

If such an event occurs and Reddit still exists, perhaps one can revisit this and laugh at how wrong we all were.

My guess: November 4, 2021. National Chicken Lady Day, the day no one expects a crash to happen. Some do say that a crash tends to happen unexpectedly, so it's perfect.

The contract, if finalized, is expected to be in the range of $10-15 Million. Most importantly they have confirmed that the GEN3 PUREVAPTM Quartz Reduction Reactors pilot plant project is now transitioning from the assembly phase to the commissioning and testing phases for Q4 2021. This could be their largest project yet creating ONE STEP transformation of quartz to high purity silicon metal at vastly cheaper costs, energy input and most importantly carbon footprint. Insiders own close to 47% of the float leaving just about 70 million shares afloat. PYR is new and innovative in their sector developing energy and cost saving techniques while also formulating sustainable industrial practices, which is why I think they could take a huge lead in their sector. It blew past $9 back in February when the market was moving in a good direction and plummeted to $4. With such great news coming out this month for PYR I can see a quick return to where they were heading back in February."
2021-06-12 00:00:00,stocks,"When to take a profit and move on? I am new to investing in individual stocks. I put most of my retirement money in mutual funds and leave it alone, but I have given myself a few bucks to invest in individual stocks.

I am having a hard time reconciling two things. I buy in to stocks with usually very small positions. 100 dollars worth etc. I don't like to average up so when a stock goes up. I very rarely buy more, but then I get in the mentality that I shouldn't sell because I'm only making a 20 dollar profit for instance.

Part of this post is to start a discussion on this topic, but also just to get some general advice on when to go ahead and close a position. Take the little bit of money and run to find something else."
2021-06-11 20:33:28,stocks,"So I closed a position today and from $1585 I made $365. Took a month or so but that's over 20% from a small investment. Could've made $685 but again, nobody can time the market perfectly so it is what it is."
2021-06-11 20:47:46,stocks,Let your winners run. You can't make a 10 bagger if you sell at 20% gain.
2021-06-12 08:58:58,stocks,"It isn't meaningful to see the profit you make as, ""20 dollars or so"" but in percentages. 

Generally, you do not move on until something fundamentally changes about the stonk since you've bought it. If your strategy is dependent on percentages of your portfolio in certain stonks and industries then you need to predetermine before you buy when you will rebalance. Will it be during periods in the year or after you've seen x% gains. And then you sell a portion to align with your targets.


Always do your DD first and decide these things before buying.



Are you going to be active and present in the market while it is open on every trading day? Are you going to be passive and buy with your paychecks every month? Somewhere in between?


What is your time horizon? Are you in the market for the next 40-60 years or do you plan to pull out a large chunk for something like a first residential home purchase in a few years?



Don't run to find other things. Know a business really well before you invest. Unless you're taking that money away from investing; keep the money in the stonks that have good fundamentals. Only sell part of your positions on predetermined targets whether that is %gains or %reallignment of your portfolio."
2021-06-12 03:18:27,stocks,"I think it's probably better to think in percentage instead of looking at numbers. Assuming you are trading in a platform without fees. 
A 20% increase is actually alot... Without looking at the initial investment which is $100."
2021-06-11 22:29:17,stocks,"When the pr√≠nciples change, when is going to take more time to desired value, when you get a better oportunity"
2021-06-12 11:09:24,stocks,"When you buy, are you planning on owning stock in this company for a long time (over a year) or less than that?  This comes with determining if you‚Äôre making a short term or long term play.  If you expect the stock to do very well over the long term, don‚Äôt sell for short term profit. 

I also invest smaller amounts, like $100ish.  This means that a 20% return gives me less money than if I invested more, but it also limits my risk.  

My personal strategy is to take my profits (or take half) around 25% to 30% when it‚Äôs a short term play and to try to sell the rest before it goes below my cost basis.  

I‚Äôm just fucking around to make a little extra money, which is what I suspect quite good percent of redditors are doing as well.  When I invest $100, I know I‚Äôm not going to make thousands or even hundreds.  I just try to set a range for the rate of return I‚Äôll start to sell at and make myself stick to that."
2021-06-12 16:01:01,stocks,"Here is what I do. I play for profit. I kind of consider risk in the equation also. If I can make 500$$ in a day for a sale I'm generally out that fast. Sometimes I ride it a bit but do not care to hold if I can prevent it.  I'm not a risk taker so I play small mostly, say $$10k at a buy. I have owned say $$100k of LOW or the like but its always short term, hour sometimes days but I do not prefer it. I play out of an IRA so that eliminates all the paperwork of sales, wash sales, losses etc. NO tax until you take the money out. Sometimes I may play the same stock 5, 8 times a month, such as BJRI, PLAY, CAKE, sometimes a couple of times the same day.  I'm up about 40k last 14 months just messing around with it.  This is just some ideas to look and and use any you can discard the rest."
2021-06-12 16:04:25,stocks,"If you make $20 on $100 invest in a day for example, figure the APR and you will see you are doing GREAT!"
2021-06-12 16:04:55,stocks,That is a solid plan.
2021-06-12 16:11:37,stocks,"That is really a great return. Id be proud of it. $12.16 a day return on $1585, the bank would have given you .05 if they liked you. I know some risk was evolved but its a good return. Figure the APR and you will be amazed."
2021-06-12 02:41:29,stocks,And let the taken out money loose it's value. Also benefits of compounding interest.
2021-06-12 16:06:47,stocks,For sure you must learn to let go. Its like a bad marriage you keep thinking might change.
2021-06-12 10:56:26,stocks,"Thanks for your reply. My retirement accounts are going to sit and ride forever. This brokerage account is more for hopefully accumulating some wealth for something like a big purchase as you noted. 

Your final comment got me thinking. So far, I have thought ... There's always another stock with a momentum play.. always another company to invest in, but maybe that's not always the case."
2021-06-12 04:48:50,stocks,"I was in your shoes not long ago and spent a lot of time thinking about it. You just need an exciting but somewhat realistic goal. For me it became +20%.

Whenever I'm starting to feel frisky about a position, if it's above +20% profit I just sell without thinking twice about it and move on to something else I judge a better opportunity. 

Profit is profit and no one ever became poor taking profits."
2021-06-12 16:36:18,stocks,"Thanks buddy, small incremental wins are better than a loss of any amount."
2021-06-11 20:11:26,stocks,What resources do you use. It's hard for me to discern whats actually good advice
2021-06-11 20:13:20,stocks,"Not Reddit. 

It takes a while but there are some contributors on Seeking Alpha that are very intelligent. It sort of depends on your investing style"
2021-06-11 20:14:43,stocks,"I think I'm favoring an aggressive long term approach bot afraid of a few risky plays, but I want a solid portfolio on top of that"
2021-06-12 00:04:54,stocks,"Wife and I have only been at it for about a year but have focused on longer holds overall, though we have bought and sold several times during the pandemic, which was largely inflated. Glad to have ditched the EV companies before they all tanked. A lot of vaporware in that segment as well. Now it's all about finding those long holds. I'm not confident betting on options/margins. I guess the 60% return isn't bad in that time. I feel our intuition is good, but lack a technical understanding when it comes to some ofnthe other market nuances, feel for good timing, etc."
2021-06-12 18:30:59,stocks,"I love the finance, business and the stock market. I literally do it for a living so it doesn't seem like work to me. If however, I didn't enjoy it, I would only buy the index like VTI and SPY

In fact, I would bet that VTI will outperform 80% of the people who post here.

My retirement funds are all indexed in mutual funds. 

-------------

Im a weird investor in that I don't like new unproven companies. Because of that I miss out on most of the homerun 10,000% returns. However, I also haven't lost money on a single position I've created in the last 5 years. I don't look for the disruptor or next big thing. I look for the big thing that is going to transition from growth to profit in the next 10 years. That's typically where I've found the best ‚Äúdeals‚Äù in the market"
2021-06-12 00:00:00,stocks,"What is relatively safe to go long on for long-term right now as we are at ATHs? I've been trading options for a while and I'm burned out of losing.  I just want to put my remaining cash in an ETF or some type of fund that will show decent growth/gains in the next few years, but not hurt me too bad in another crash. I'm just wary about throwing all of my cash into the market (even diversified) with everything at ATHs.

I'm in a 2055 target fund in my IRA and thats been working out, but I'm looking for something I can put my regular brokerage acct. into so I can buy/sell without penalty if I desire.  I'm struggling with trying to decide between ETFs like VOO/VOOG or VTI. I want growth, but I don't want everything to just go to the trash can all at once on a down day.  

Would you recommend just plopping say 70% of my cash in VOOG and the remaining 30% in some bond ETF like TLT? Should I just sit in cash and wait for another bug downturn?  These are just ideas, but wondering what others think."
2021-06-12 02:42:41,stocks,"Sitting on extra cash you won't need in the next 5 years or so is costing you. Lump it into a index like VOO/VTI/VXUS and forget about it. Nothing about it is exciting but it's the easiest way to make passive income on your cash that is relatively safe.

Waiting for a correction/crash could take many years at which point your buying power is less later on due to inflation."

So your local supermarket that is supposed to hedge against the very thing you're afraid of is going to jump off a cliff at some point.

 I work in online grocery at Walmart and there are SO MANY KINKS that they really... REALLY need to work out. Worker accountability and productivity is a huge issue, inconsistent DoorDash drivers, inconsistent pickup process at different Walmarts, not enough equipment for employees.

These are the individuals who cannot afford the higher cost of goods sold by Amazon. Also, these lower wage earners typically purchase in person rather than online. Many don't have credit cards or even bank accounts and strictly deal in cash. \~20% of the population only deal in, or specifically prefer, cash.

As we've seen over the last few decades, the middle income earning bracket is shrinking from over 60% to under 50% while the low and high income brackets are expanding. What this means is that companies who typically benefited from middle and higher income earners will not experience the growth of customer base that a lower income targeting company would. Obviously the margins are greater the higher up you go on the wage ladder but Walmart isn't in exactly the same retail space that Amazon is. 

I think Walmart will continue to see growth for quite some time, especially during a recession. And they will also have arguments that supporting Walmart over Amazon benefits the working class because they won't swap their employees for robotic machinery (at least yet). We all saw the impact of the 'Made in America' campaigns."

Why would the USA and the FED stop him fr consolidating his power and wealth/business? It always benefits them they make piles of free money from them?. The market and the government have too many fingers in all the pies of BIG business and Big Pharma. There‚Äôs no much bad money and nefarious things that take place that I guarantee Banzos has a whole division of people that just lobby the government and the industry big wigs to keep them all happy

2021-06-12 09:38:00,stocks,"I had almost assumed that they had already surpassed Walmart.  One good thing that has come out of their competition is that both have brought their minimum wage way up.  As the largest retailers, that makes for a lot of employees benefiting from the back and forth (even with the push for automation).  Ultimately Amazon has much more behind it as an entire company.  If Walmart wants to compete at that scale they have a lot of work to do and a lot of various segments in which they will need to involve themselves through expansion and acquisition."

2021-06-11 23:00:34,stocks,"If you go tour an Amazon warehouse you would be surprised how many people are working there. Robotics have definitely reduced headcount needs but usually it‚Äôs speeding up how fast associates can do jobs, like robots bringing you the work instead of walking. If Amazon wasn‚Äôt able to do this they couldn‚Äôt keep up with the rapid growth. Fully automated fulfillment centers are very far away. Imagine a company with 1m people growing over 30% a year trying to open up buildings and hire people fast enough, it‚Äôs insane and would be impossible without robotics."

2021-06-12 08:30:25,stocks,Because automation is supposed to free humanity. But currently it just allows a few to hoard wealth.

Look what happened when everything was sold which they held, stock prices went down, quickly. All i am saying is that any of the other shorted stocks could cause the reaction Archegos experienced. i just used the AMC top ten shorters as i have seen it somewhere on Reddit as an example because they all appear to hold safe stock like Amazon, FB, Apple to name a few....

But regardless, the nice thing about Amazon is they are very liberal with returns so its not like there is any risk of bad purchase.

Tbh, I'm struggling to come up with many examples on shitty products even for no brands. I've bought good quality nail clippers for decent price, a high quality air fryer, large colander, cutting board, etc etc. Maybe it has to do with budget as well.

You can certainly hate tech messiah's all you'd like. The world could use a bit more of a critical eye on the otherwise infallible elite. It's not going to hurt you to not like Bezos, unless of course your goal is to lay under him. Even then, I'm sure he'd dip his stick in anyone for the fun of it.

My goal in life is not to be a a hoarding lunatic like Bezos. I'd certainly rather spend my time and social clout trying to convince my peers to stop supporting that ass hole.

This is a long standing thing with them. I‚Äôm not sure where you have been for the last decade but it is undisputed fact that they exploit workers and consumers. What‚Äôs even more nuts is You defending them. I mean just because you can. You thinks a normal and a CEO has 190 billion net worth and has thousands of workers on food stamps. You think it‚Äôs normal to pay $15 an hour with 22 billion in profit. In what world are you living in that you rationalize this stuff?

You don‚Äôt have a leg to stand on. Coming back and me fudging numbers and lying doesn‚Äôt change the facts. Most educated people out there are tuned into these issues and understand the implications of them. 

Stop defending a system that is literally raping you and exploiting people. Stop doing it just because you can and think more about who you are defending? What you have to gain from doing so? Try to put yourself in the shoes of the workers and customers affected by this. And how just it is that a company that churns this kind of profit is exploiting people.

It makes such little sense when I see guys like you shooting your own generation in the foot... more interested in getting a rise out of people than they are standing up for fairness, equality, opportunity. 

Last piece of advice... you need to learn how to connect the dots.... how systems, especially multimillion/billion churning ones have affects that spread throughout society and effect other things/people. Things are interconnected in that way... only when you educate yourself and learn about economics, finance, technology will you see how important it is that companies act responsibly and laws/regulations are in place to protect us. You have to learn to look at things on a boarder scale. If you are really so bright you‚Äôd be able to do that and if you still had a good argument it would be a lot different than it is here. Maybe this just requires growing up and some more educating yourself. Maybe you need to do some traveling too to experience other parts of the world to see how badly exploitation, consolidation of power, monopoly, lack of regulation/law, lack of fairness, and all these things can play out.

It amazes me that you can keep talking and not once realize that every choice you make, whether it's investing, shopping, or walking your dog down the street, you are making moral choices.

Here's your weird ass logic:

""Well, I have to eat, so it doesn't really matter what I'm eating. Food is food. We are in a restaurant, not a church"". Well... go eat a dick.

Now does not investing in Amazon really do much for the bigger picture? Does voting matter? Does anything matter? That's a personal question, and apparently you don't get it. Nihilism has flooded your brain and filled your head with soup apparently. This isn't a novel idea. Investors of all different sizes bring their personal morals to the table when investing.

You won‚Äôt be stupid rich but you also won‚Äôt lose your shirt when the market becomes highly unstable.  So the most import thing is to hedge your risk which is easy to do with options.  What I‚Äôm doing is buying companies with a high stable dividend like telocos, drug companies, etc and out of the money call options on short etf.  These companies will also go down when it pops but I‚Äôll make up any of the loses and then some with the options.  Don‚Äôt get greedy buying the options, frauds and bubbles can go on a long time.

More about how money follows in the current system Jeff Snider and Emil K. have a YouTube serious called EuroDollar University.

Michael Hudson has lots of videos on YouTube explaining the history of debt and economics.  He famous for firing Greenspan on orders of David Rockefeller.  Ignore the MMT stuff it is correct that the government can create money but ignores the fact banks create the vast majority of the money.  Michael Hudson knows this but for some reason Stephanie Kelton book ignores this simple fact.  It also ignores behavior economics and cascading effects.  Steve Keen also has some good information but he tends to ignore second order effects and tail risk.

The thing to remember is making money in the market is more about luck than skill.  Taleb goes over this in his books.  He takes advantage of the fact the current system miss prices tail risks.  Bill Ackman also took advantage of this when he made what people consider the greatest trade in 2020."

2021-06-11 21:44:12,stocks,"Selling options. He has 100 shares of NVDA (or more). He collects a fee known as a premium from the person he sells the option to. When you sell a call you are selling someone the right to buy your 100 shares at the current price IF it hits the strike price. If it does not reach the strike price their option expires worthless, but the person that sold the option gets to keep the premium and their shares. 

You have 100 shares of ABC at a current price of $0.75. You then sell someone a call with a strike price of $1.00. You collect $13.00 premium for selling that option. That person has a break even price of $1.13. So the price of the stock would have to hit $1.13 just to account for the premium they had to pay to buy the option contract. One scenario is that the stock reaches $1.20 and your shares are called away you receive $1.00 for all your shares and you get to keep the premium. They get to keep the profit of $0.10 a share they made. You on the other hand made $0.38 a share. OR let‚Äôs say the price of the stock only reached $1.02. Their option expires worthless. You get to keep the premium and can then sell your shares if you want or sell another call.

why? their earnings growth has outpaced the share price which has been stagnant from almost a year now... and before that, it was also stagnant for almost 2 years as well

2021-06-12 05:40:52,stocks,">In the developed world, low to zero rates have been the reality for a while for a variety of reasons, and if you factor that in, the stocks are far from overvalued.

Yes I agree, which is why the Schiller ratio is adjusted for the past 10 year's earnings, not the last year. Like I said, if you expect several more years of interest rates at zero, they look fairly valued. Even the historically low rates of the past decade were higher than they are now, with fewer genuine inflation concerns. Though there are people that still believe QE in the form of money sent directly to people (to spend) will produce no more inflation than previous QE in the form of increased bank reserves. We'll see.

>Also, tech companies that make entirely new markets and industries for themselves, function as cross-border monopolies in many cases, and have network effects to entrench themselves command a higher valuation. They have sky high margins and create new problems that they then resolve via demand for their own products -- such as needing a wireless charger if you take a charge port out. Or wireless headphones if no more headphone jack.

Yes, I understand all of that. I said it's already priced in. Why else do you think Apple has traded sideways for 10 months now? Amazon still hasn't passed the high it set in early September, while value stocks have soared.

2021-06-12 10:58:07,stocks,In the specific case of AMZN I want to bringt to your attention that last year AMZN spent $12bn on Covid related safety measures which would otherwise be pure profit and bringing down the P/E further. Also they had like triple the amount of research and development expenses than e.g. Apple or Facebook just because they are experimenting with new lines of business. So if Amzn really focuses on actually maximizing their earnings their P/E would easily come down to around 20-25. in addition to the huge rev growth the actual price is a bargain imo

2021-06-11 20:51:24,stocks,"So I've been thinking a lot about inflation and when/how it manifests, and when/how it really matters. 

Seems to me food prices are the be all end all of inflation as far as forcing the fed's hand on interest rates. People will put up with a lot of stuff being more expensive, but I think food is a different beast. We all need to eat - we can't put it off like a new car or a new deck. If food gets too expensive either the fed takes action or there are riots. 

So, when/will food prices inflate in a meaningful way for the American consumer?

The way that we keep our supermarkets stocked year round - especially for many fruits, berries, and vegetables - is by using a precisely calibrated global network of food growers, shippers, and distributors. Just when one season ends in one part of the world, another season begins elsewhere and fills the gap. 

Right now we're seeing some food shortages and price increases. This is in part domestic yield loss, but predominantly because we're in the global growers phase of production and distribution for many products - and as with most things, global goods are delayed in shipment along several bottlenecks.

Starting in July, the food cycle switches from international to predominantly domestic sources for many fruits berries and veggies, a large percentage of which are grown in California. 

https://www.pickyourown.org/CAharvestcalendar.htm

On the one hand, domestic crops solve the issue of international shipping. However, they still run into the enormous bottlenecks of not having farm workers and not having truck drivers. 

But most worryingly, they also run squarely into the worst drought in a thousand years - a drought that is already wreaking havoc and, barring a miraculous storm, has no end in sight. 

And the drought isn't limited to CA - much of the south and Midwest and in drought conditions, to the detriment of crops of all kinds. 

Seems to me the stage is set for a food dilemma come, say, August/September 2021? Alternatively, if the drought doesn't utterly decimate crops this year, but continues unabated into next year, then, I guess, raincheck to August/September 2022? 

In either event, who wins and who loses, stock wise, if there is a major spike in food prices? Presumably interest rate increases will cause everything to correct - but some companies will be hit harder due to food costs and some presumably will profit.

Of course, now that I've said it, it will likely spite me and form a third rounded top. But seriously, it looks good.

2021-06-12 14:38:50,stocks,"Depends on your time horizon. I'm a fundamental investor. I buy things that are underpriced. I generally don't sell things unless the price imbalance was a temporary arbitrage opportunity.

Right now I'm buying BABA, TCEHY and TME.

BABA got murdered over ANT IPO and anti-trust. Anti-trust turned out to be a massive nothing-burger. ANT IPO shouldn't matter, even if it's worth nothing their stake was maybe only worth $77B at it's peak. It shouldn't have lost $250B in market cap because of that.

 TCEHY is just a cash compounding machine that is currently cheap vs historical valuation.

TME got caught up in the Archegos blow up, it was overvalued during that big spike but now it's about 10-15% undervalued IMO. They own 20% of UMG which is now valued much more than when they bought that stake (using PSTH as benchmark). They have also fixed their anti-trust problems by having Universal and Sony license music to their competitors - which sounds but isn't, they have a very dominant market position all the same.

I'm also loading QQQ but that is pretty boring and only thesis is interest rates are going to trend down.

Recently I bought financials because rates were going up and they were mispriced vs a higher interest rate environment. I sold most of my financials last week except for WFC as I think that stock is still undervalued because of sentiment related to their fuckups over the last ~18 months.

My reason for selling is that I think in the short term the 10Y which is the main benchmark rate for banks financial products is going to trend down, atleast until about 1.25%. This has a significant impact on their valuations.

I bought energy when the oil prices started to come back in November and sold out my of my positions when oil hit my PT of $70.

Having said that, I'm seeing signs that it's possible that valuation might not matter again until September or so. The best proxy for high growth at least for me (ARKK) just closed decisively over the 200 day (and an ETF that TDOC is in) and the Nasdaq looks like it wants its all time high and possibly beyond, with the way it has been behaving after that capitulation bottom in May starting to remind me more of last summer and November-mid-February, straight up melt-up mode.

2021-06-12 07:35:41,stocks,"The only thing I would suggest is never lose sight of the fact that it's the stock price that will move the option price. If your DD about the stock is good, you get multiple times the return if you had only invested in stocks. You might also lose everything as you can't hold the option forever, unlike a stock.
About this particular investment, buy calls for, say a third or a fourth of the amount that you would have invested in the stock itself.  Then use the remaining money (two thirds or 3 fourths) to buy calls for other companies.  That way your risk is spread and if even one of them takes off, you will still get a decent return on your overall investment. 
Good Luck."

Is it the same for ESPP stocks? If I buy them at a 15% discount and sell them the day I receive them, is my tax obligation only $0? Or do I have to pay taxes on that 15% amount?

2021-06-11 22:18:24,stocks,"A lot of things, but to keep it brief: they‚Äôre selling shovels (batteries and charging stations) in a gold (EV) rush. Unlike the majority of SPACs, it‚Äôs already a functional business with a steady stream of revenue. Commercial EV represents a vast untapped market ‚Äî estimated $260b right now ‚Äî and Proterra currently serves HALF of the market (front runner status). 

The Biden admin has already made it very clear that investing in this sector is one of their central priorities ‚Äî Biden had a virtual tour of Proterra HQ to promote the infrastructure bill not too long ago. Commercial EV has been largely overlooked in favor of flashier companies like Lucid or Tesla, but it has the potential to be really big. American-made definitely helps with Proterra too.

I think a large reason why this stock has been overlooked in recent months is simply due to SPAC hate, which is understandable with so many bad ones abound. However, I believe the stock has real potential of taking off once it officially is de-SPACed on Tuesday and becomes Proterra (PTRA).

2021-06-12 12:18:59,stocks,"I am a little bullish on VIAC but I do share some of those concerns. CBS is still the most watched network in the US and has been for like a decade or more, but the gap is closing. Plus as you said P+ seems like it's not terribly long for this world. 

It's actually kind of frustrating how badly VIAC bungled the transition into the streaming era. I recall Comedy Central, MTV, and Nickelodeon being among the first networks to offer full episodes for streaming, and even remember them offering a few series (namely South Park and Chappelle's Show) completely for free with no cable login. They also beat every other media conglomerate to the whole streaming hub concept by *years* with CBS All Access, but the lack of content and confusing marketing/branding allowed everyone else to overtake them. I remember thinking, why would I pay extra for a streaming service attached to a free-to-watch network? 

Paramount+ is a step in the right direction, but I still feel like the branding is going to hold it back, as the Paramount name doesn't have a lot of clout anymore, and people don't necessarily associate it with the ViacomCBS networks. Personally, I think something like ""VIA"" would be a better name, but unfortunately their marketing department doesn't take suggestions from random people on the internet. 

IMO, the biggest threat to VIAC right now is the upcoming WB/Discovery joint venture. Just combining the current subscribers to HBO Max and Disc+ is 60 million subscriptions, which is almost double what P+ currently has. Add in the natural growth over the next year, plus a boost when the new platform launches... it's not looking good."

Second, it says that private prisons had higher rates of finding contraband (which seems like a plus) and assault, but it also says that private prisons have a lower rate of sexual assault and positive drug tests. On top of this, the study said that they were unsure if these differences in rates were because of demographics and location, or because the prison was a private prison. Lastly, they only found flaws in 3/12 prisons they studied. And who knows if these were even GEO prisons? This was 6 years ago, too, when private prisons were just starting to increase their partnership with the fed, so a lot of improvements have been made since then!"

Latency wont be a problem for any single player game but if the internet goes out, then you cant play. Seems to me that most folk are ok with this.

I think with multiplayer, what they will do is run them a lot like MMO's or any other online game with a limited number of players. If Diablo 2 could do it back in the day and people thought that was good enough despite lag and network issues, and that was very twitchy, then they will find ways to make it happen. And with cloud the way it is, its just a matter of deploying containers regionally which keeps getting easier.

The hard part is getting all the devs to figure out how to optimize for network gaming. There is obviously no consistency to devs and adding these features is not cookie cutter. You cant just slap a library into your game and be optimized. Its an entire design philosophy that should start from early development. Though it can probably be hacked in later, I have a feeling it would be much harder to do than if you put controls in early on to maintain control.

Now all that said, if anyone can do this its MSFT. They are a software 1st company and this is one of the cases where everything can be easier if MSFT provides excellent libraries or even a game engine that does most, if not all, the network work automatically. This wont be easy but if anyone can do it, its MSFT. I have zero faith in Google with their chaotic approach to libraries and there is no chance in hell that Nintendo or Sony will figure that out without buying someone out."
2021-06-12 01:29:34,stocks,"Except that MSFT is an actual software company... Have you ever worked with Google products? They are a mess. Just last week I had a major feature broken by a Google REST API update that they didnt bother to mention to anyone... Granted they are prompt to respond but they are just so chaotic. Still they are 100x better than Apple, Sony or Nintendo on that front but MSFT is a totally different level of expertise.

Plus MSFT has a ton of 1st party games while Google has almost nothing and depend on 3rd parties for most everything. They were hoping it would be like Android I guess. Didnt work. Think about Nintendo for a sec. The only reason they exist is because of their 1st party games. Without those, no one would buy their consoles. 

MSFT games have huge fanbase. They can easily drive folks to their console. Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Halo, Gears of War, Dishonered, Forza, Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, etc. If they make them well, these will drive folks to their console. What does Google have? Nothing. They recently shut down their 1st party studios."

2021-06-12 13:41:31,stocks,"What games do you play on Stadia?

Are you telling me you can't feel an input delay at all?  Adding 60-100ms of input delay to any game will make it practically unplayable.  Not laggy, unplayable.  You sound ignorant and childish.

Latency between server and client, your ping, will never reduce to 0 or anything close to it, in fact they are a measure of distance, not technological progress.  The speed of light will never bring the other end of your city, if you are lucky enough to live in one with a server, close enough to your mind such that your controller's input is instantaneous.  There will always be a perceptible delay between button press and monitor action.  It is unavoidable.

Even without stadia, multiplayer gaming relies on multiple lag masking techniques that require rendering the client's graphics locally to guess at the future using the same code that is running on the server, and being corrected when the packets sent back from the server are authoritatively used to override incorrect guesses.  It is a grand illusion.  You are never seeing what is actually happening on the server.  Your comment strongly indicates to me that you are wholly ignorant of how this process functions.

If you're playing single-player story driven games on a console, well congratulations, your opinion doesn't matter.

Multiplayer games using authoritative server-client architecture solved the dumb terminal input delay problem using lag masking techniques that locally predict the future gamestate the server is currently sending but that we have not received yet.  Stadia can never solve this problem technologically.  Their structure is fundamentally flawed.

If you play on a TV as opposed to a 1ms gaming monitor, the problem gets even worse.  If you play on a console as opposed to a PC, the problem gets even worse, again.

However putting one together, creating a UI for it, hooking in the app store, getting apps for it, etc. - that takes quite a bit of effort.  That takes a large team.  Huge teams worked on bringing up new versions of the Windows phone, even when the only change was the internal proc and some relatively minor features.

Also, if you rip out most of the Windows features from the OS to make it lean and mean, then that takes away a lot of the reasons for basing the system on Windows in the first place.  The whole point of a Windows-based system is that you get a lot apps and compatibility for free, directly from the desktop OS.  However, if you take out components then the apps stop working because they require this and that.  And the more you add back to get things working, the more resources the system requires."

I think buying and selling calls to trade the volatility spikes could be a way to make some extra capital to buy the stock with at less risk to underlying shares. 

 If anything, use the capital underneath selling some puts at a strike that won't wreck your cost average.  If you are happy owning the stock for several years, you will not be upset seeing some exercise at a favorable price on a short term selloff.

2021-06-12 10:47:51,stocks,How is TME different than TCEHY?
2021-06-12 18:39:58,stocks,Not really. Banking on people continuing to be fat-asses who sit on their computers all day long with a bucket of KFC is pretty reasonable.

2021-06-12 18:05:40,stocks,"It looks like you are heavily invested in high dividend paying stocks. For a 19 year old with that amount I would be skewing a bit more into growth.

That's why I very much like the SQ pick. I think you should balance your high dividend stocks with some growth stocks (GOOG, MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, FB for example). 

It's good to see you have some oil and gas exposure as that is usually the one thing young investors overlook."

2021-06-12 19:49:29,stocks,So I was thinking a stop at loss at 40 or 42 but does that mean the second it hits that price it sells? Or only if it closes below that number. I know AMC fluctuates a lot during the day and can open around 42 and work back up towards 50
2021-06-12 19:32:57,stocks,Thanks for the response

Op said they are irrelevant. Which is true. Why does there need to be an 'also' here."
2021-06-12 09:11:07,stocks,"PLTR doesn't have room to go to 0 haha.  It has massive, long term contracts with the government that add a ton of stability to their balance sheet.

Diversification is obviously important, and it is good to have large stable companies, but if you're looking for high returns, they aren't really the place to be long term.  

Initial investment capital outlay really is something that is dependent on the person in question.  Are they young with plenty of savings?  Aggressive growth is the way.  Older, or may need to access said funds without a lot of notice?  Growth is not the way.  Same thing with temperament and how they are investing.  If they panic easily and/or check their account daily, risk is probably a bad idea.  If they set it and forget it, or they aren't bothered by paper losses, then they are much better suited to risk assets"

The potential return without others being involved is crazy enough but get enough people involved and we can accelerate and boost it ourselves! Join the community and help this grow."
2021-06-12 02:42:56,stocks,Does sell-off mean it will rise another 15% since the day after ER?
