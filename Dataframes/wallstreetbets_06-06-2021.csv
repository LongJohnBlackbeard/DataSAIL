2021-06-06 19:09:44,wallstreetbets,"I have 211 shares in Rite Aid because of the Amazon buyout speculation. Amazon is a behemoth and the only way their stock price goes up further at the same pace it used to will be with acquisitions and the case for RAD makes sense.

That being said, if the buy out doesn’t happen within 2 months I’m out. These rumors have been going on since 2019. There are other better places to park side money."
2021-06-06 18:55:49,wallstreetbets,I keep seeing people talking about Amazon purchasing a pharmacy but I though that would end after they purchased Pill Pack last year.  They have actually started rebranding as Amazon Pharmacy. I realized they have a past relationship with RAD but with only 2400 stores left the footprint is quite small for a pharmacy brand.
2021-06-06 18:54:54,wallstreetbets,"There are other bag holders? Fuck- I lost more money on rad than on 
Any other play EVER."

2021-06-06 18:45:56,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. This company is currently target for a number of investigations. Both public and not. Their growth is abysmal. Their competition (seasoned ISSUERS like Anthem) will stifle any growth. 

This is an easy short. This is a wanna be healthcare tech company that doesn’t do anything unique. 

Don’t listen to to the shill pumpers on /wsb. You don’t want to invest in this POS


Your comments on Medicare fraud is misguided and misunderstood. The codes are submitted by providers and it’s an auditing issue it will never go away. With CLOV it’s bound to get worse."

2021-06-06 18:31:58,wallstreetbets,Huh? VIX is literally the market's prediction of volatility in the future 30 days.
2021-06-06 18:33:19,wallstreetbets,"Yes the VIX is a future, but generally is considered to current price, similar to other futures if you will. Nobody predicts volatility until there is volatility. Also I don't understand much on how you would trade it."
2021-06-06 18:44:28,wallstreetbets,"Not true, VIX predicts future volatility and incorporates expected volatility from future events (eg elections). There are plenty of ways to trade volatility, and every time you buy or sell an option you implicitly take a long or short position on the volatility of the underlying."
2021-06-06 19:02:40,wallstreetbets,"The CBOE provides the following formula as a general example of how the VIX is calculated:

\sigma^2 = \frac{2}{T}\sum_i \frac{\Delta K_i}{K_i^2}e^{RT} Q(K_i) - \frac{1}{T}\left [\frac{F}{K_0} - 1\right]^2σ

The calculations behind each part of the equation are rather complex for most people who don’t do math for a living. They are also far too complex to fully explain in a short reddit comment, so let’s put some numbers into the formula to make the math easier to follow:

\begin{aligned} \sigma^2 =& \ \tfrac{21,600}{525,600} \times 0.066472 \times \left ( \tfrac{61,920 - 43,200}{61,920 - 21,600} \right ) +\\ \phantom{\sigma^2 =}& \ \tfrac{61,920}{525,600} \times 0.063667 \times \left ( \tfrac{43,200 - 21,600}{61,920 - 21,600} \right ) \times \tfrac{525,600}{43,200} \\ \sigma^2 =& \ 0.0643180321 \\ \sigma =& \ 0.253610 \\ \end{aligned}

VIX = 100 \times \sigma = 25.36VIX=100×σ=25.36

The VIX is calculated using a formula to derive expected volatility by averaging the weighted prices of out-of-the-money puts and calls. Using options that expire in 16 and 44 days, respectively, in the example below, and starting on the far left of the formula, the symbol on the left of “=” represents the number that results from the calculation of the square root of the sum of all the numbers that sit to the right multiplied by 100.

To get to that number:

The first set of numbers to the right of the “=” represents time. This figure is determined by using the time to expiration in minutes of the nearest term option divided by 525,600, which represents the number of minutes in a 365-day year. Assuming the VIX calculation time is 8:30 a.m., the time to expiration in minutes for the 16-day option will be the number of minutes within 8:30 a.m. today and 8:30 a.m. on the settlement day. In other words, the time to expiration excludes midnight to 8:30 a.m. today and excludes 8:30 a.m. to midnight on the settlement day (full 24 hours excluded). The number of days we’ll be working with will technically be 15 (16 days minus 24 hours), so it's 15 days x 24 hours x 60 minutes = 21,600. Use the same method to get the time to expiration in minutes for the 44-day option to get 43 days x 24 hours x 60 minutes = 61,920 (Step 4).
The result is multiplied by the volatility of the option, represented in the example by 0.066472.
The result is then multiplied by the result of the difference between the number of minutes to expiration of the next term option (61,920) minus the number of minutes in 30 days (43,200). This result is divided by the difference of the number of minutes to expiration of the next term option (61,920) minus the number of minutes to expiration of the near term option (21,600). Just in case you’re wondering where 30 days came from, the VIX uses a weighted average of options with a constant maturity of 30 days to expiration.
The result is added to the sum of the time calculation for the second option, which is 61,920 divided by the number of minutes in a 365-day year (525,600). Just as in the first calculation, the result is multiplied by the volatility of the option, represented in the example by 0.063667.
Next we repeat the process covered in step 3, multiplying the result of step 4 by the difference of the number of minutes in 30 days (43,200), minus the number of minutes to expiration of the near-term options (21,600). We divide this result by the difference of the number of minutes to expiration of the next-term option (61,920) minus the number of minutes to expiration of the near-term options (21,600).
The sum of all previous calculations is then multiplied by the result of the number of minutes in a 365-day year (525,600) divided by the number of minutes in 30 days (43,200).
The square root of that number multiplied by 100 equals the VIX."
2021-06-06 18:45:55,wallstreetbets,"That is true, but I don't see how the VIX could really predict short-term market conditions, mainly because it is short-term market conditions. If you see the vix rise, it could just as easily fall the next day."
2021-06-06 19:47:20,wallstreetbets,"keyword ""expected"" fact is it is just the cost of options the VIX almost always reacts inversely to the price of SPX"

I also tried to put up a post that described that BB does not have enough short interest for a squeeze, and also that BB has 40%+ institutional owners, which will dump when price rises. all deleted as well, even though it is the truth.

2021-06-06 19:50:47,wallstreetbets,"$CLOV ! Hear me out

Recently some brokers are restricting short selling!!
*** NUMBER 4 on WSB hottest stocks mentions! 100% increase over 24hours!!

Fellow APES, DO NOT MISS THE ROCKETSHIP!
I missed out on GME at 10$ and regretted so bad when I pulled the trigger and bought at 169.
Not missing out on this!

Other CRAZY CATALYSTS for CLOV!!

1. Extremely high SI (40%+)
2. CEO and owners can’t sell until stock hits 30$ for 90 days. Stock is currently at 9$.
3. Recently joined MCSI index and had a nice run up from 7.7 to 9
4. ZERO DEBT, 700 million cash, unlike AMC, no risk of dilution!
5. Will be added to Russel 3000 soon, should be another nice reason to begin lift-off. ** MVIS was added last Friday and we saw what happened there!
6. Available shares to short almost done and BORROWING rate going up, doubled last week.
7. They beat earnings two weeks ago! 
8. Backed by Chamath and Chelsea Clinton is on board
9. Partnership with Walmart 
Do not miss the next rocketship"
2021-06-06 19:28:44,wallstreetbets,Too many shorts jumped on this one too fast and has allowed For a Few Good squeezes but I think the final squeeze will push a lot more out

2021-06-06 17:45:12,wallstreetbets,Definitely the worst thing to come out of this short squeeze is all the people who think si is a bullish indicator on its own.
2021-06-06 18:21:34,wallstreetbets,bro what? why
2021-06-06 18:22:55,wallstreetbets,This is the way.

2021-06-06 18:00:52,wallstreetbets,The Russel Index is bullish for sure.
2021-06-06 18:05:48,wallstreetbets,It IS bullish when you consider 10M apes buying the stock to force them to cover

2021-06-06 19:13:10,wallstreetbets,What does that have to do with si?
2021-06-06 19:11:58,wallstreetbets,Yes but trying to squeeze every stock with a high si isn't doable in my opinion
2021-06-06 18:50:59,wallstreetbets,Diversification not needed. YOLO on CLNE 🚀🚀
2021-06-06 17:36:23,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for posting, I think this will not last as this Is minor company. You should post it on the clne subreddit"
2021-06-06 19:28:06,wallstreetbets,SOFI is a no brainer. One of those stocks you buy shares and in 3 years the stock has gone 3-5x.
2021-06-06 18:20:46,wallstreetbets,"I cant speak for 23@me but I would deff go long on sofi. All of the data aside, Sofi is going to keep improving.

2021-06-06 17:32:58,wallstreetbets,"I like the SOFI trade, not sure about 23andme. I implore you to look at citizens insurance. Just hit a 52 week low with over 10% short interest and a short ratio anywhere from 50 to 80. I think this is ground zero for a solid squeeze. Ticker CIA"

2021-06-06 17:36:44,wallstreetbets,I think they would be considered 8 or 9 in the USA.  Just google search GOL flight attendants
2021-06-06 17:23:57,wallstreetbets,Good ape
2021-06-06 17:21:41,wallstreetbets,How are their flight attendants?  I've only flown GOL.
2021-06-06 18:09:53,wallstreetbets,AZUL looks good.  Any other Brazilian stocks you like?  Ones that are outside of government control.
2021-06-06 18:59:37,wallstreetbets,"Latin American women are pretty attractive in general.  They do their job too.  My experience with Latam was good.  I looked at the price per share a while ago, and thought it would come out of chapter 11, and seemed like contrarian play.  18,000 shares @ 2.05

I see upside of 300-500% over 5–10 years with LTMAQ"

2021-06-06 17:19:54,wallstreetbets,Is this a good thing overall?
2021-06-06 18:11:56,wallstreetbets,They can reject it despite the market cap meeting the requirements. They did that to UWMC
2021-06-06 17:50:17,wallstreetbets,"I dont think AMC can hold its current level, GME has been holding 150$ for months and looking at friday's volume we re in for another consolidation phase with our new floor, unless things get a bit crazy because of shareholders meeting"
2021-06-06 18:42:29,wallstreetbets,"This is huge btw. Large and mid cap ETFs handle significantly bigger money than small caps.

GME being moved up, given their tiny float, will mean that funds will have to scramble to get shares to add to their index.

For AMC this is pretty much meaningless since they diluted their shareholders in the last year 5:1 with 400 million of the 500 million shares In circulation offered in the last twelve months."

2021-06-06 17:29:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it’s good, because it affects nearly $11 trillion in investor assets that are organized based on the Russell indexes including the Russell 1000, which will be an additional boost to those stocks."
2021-06-06 18:40:21,wallstreetbets,"With the naked short video blowing up and the annual meeting on Wednesday as well as earning reports, I just don't see how GME doesn't move on Monday."
2021-06-06 19:08:58,wallstreetbets,I think AMC will settle in the 20-50 range once it hits 100. It will be some kind of elliot wave thing and then the next big one will collapse the market.

2021-06-06 18:44:32,wallstreetbets,"More so for gme. With only 70 million shares outstanding and a float of less than 40, this will be a significant buying pressure.


For AMC,with 550 million shares, of which 400 million were printed in the last twelve months when amc diluted their investors 5:1, this is basically meaningless."

2021-06-06 19:41:27,wallstreetbets,"So you paid £7k to get the option to buy shares (1400@$15). With a 24 month window as well?

This in effect means you buy the shares at $20 (the option fee and the strike price?)

I take it you don’t just buy the shares because that would tie up £21k of capital right now?"
2021-06-06 19:38:27,wallstreetbets,"They are saying that your option buying does nothing to the price. If you want movement, you also need to buy shares."

2021-06-06 19:17:31,wallstreetbets,Still great opportunity here. I plan to keep adding underneath the $8 range as far as shares go. If this stays on track it should be a $25 stock this time next year. That’s a fantastic gain/opportunity. I also have my eyes on getting some Jan 2022 calls and Some Jan 2023.
2021-06-06 18:10:00,wallstreetbets,Theoretically yes it could. I think $50 would be retail hype driven. The PT timeline on the post is conservative and fair.  Having said that $15 - $20 would not shock me by end of summer.

2021-06-06 18:59:55,wallstreetbets,DFV only talks about GME mind you
2021-06-06 17:31:29,wallstreetbets,now I guess?
2021-06-06 17:36:40,wallstreetbets,"Well there are two ways to do this.  First watch the SP all day, when you see 5 to 20 dollar drops get in and hold.  Take profits when you are up.  The second way is to wait when both retail and hedge funds are reloading and the SP drifts down.  So say its like 222 and falls to 120.  Yeah that would be a time to hop in for GME.  You know they want GME down into teens, you know they want to profit all the way down.  You have an opponent willing to sustain repetitive injuries to achieve a goal using a very specific method.

Look at any zero sum game where an instant win can be achieved.  Throwing hay makers in boxing, going all in on a poker hand and so on.  It requires a great deal of energy and effort.  If you get countered the effects can be devastating.  If you don't lose because of being countered  you are in a desperate situation.  So the instant win strategy becomes your only way out, but now it requires more effort and energy.  Again getting devastated if it doesn't work.

So we have these stupid fucking hedge funds that are throwing hay maker after hay maker.  Just dying to give away free money because they really need to win this.  They also don't want these losses to be on their yearly statement.  It's one thing to get hit in one or two quarters but make your money back in the last two.  It becomes a funny story at the Holiday Party.  But get beaten in all 4 quarters?  People lose jobs, and the ""Smart Money"" no longer looks so smart.

**There is a huge industry behind managed money.  So to get beaten by WSB is a huge blow to that as well.**  

The best part about that is they can't just turn around and join in, because that is a loss for them.  Having to bow to WSB and make money by backing the investments we like.  Retail dictating what Hedge Funds buy is a nightmare scenario for them.  Because if we can do it, it suddenly becomes repeatable.  It means WSB like entities can now pop up and change long held narratives.

My name isn't Chad Dickens and no I won't slow down."

2021-06-06 17:02:00,wallstreetbets,"May get diluted, look for preferred stock like FNMAG as well. They’d have to pay 12 years of back interest before paying interest to common. Upside is higher on common but preferred is protected.

It was a big play on here 6 or so years ago. I got in when Trump was elected because a Republican President, Republican Congress and Republican court had to cut them loose. Right? Right?!

Been in for both common and preferred for several years and it’s done fuck all, I don’t expect it to do anything ever but I’m too stubborn to sell because the government shouldn’t be in the business of owning corporations."
2021-06-06 16:55:10,wallstreetbets,"This really is an unreal opportunity, I’m with you. The expected value here is just nuts. Fannie (FNMA) made $5 billion in profit in the first quarter this year, that is fucking insane, and you have to think a company making $20 billion in profit a year is worth AT LEAST 5x earnings, for a cool $100bn. That’s 50x from today’s share price. Could easily justify $200bn+, for 100x."
2021-06-06 17:15:45,wallstreetbets,6 days into June my guy.
2021-06-06 17:45:18,wallstreetbets,I’m getting a ton of questions about the history of all this bullshit. Here is a link. The link is an interview between the author of a book called “another big lie” which is the story of the financial meltdown and the backstory on Freddie and Fannie and why the author believes they will be released from the conservatorship. If you’re willing to put your money in anything you owe yourself an hour to listen to this at the very least.  [Interview ](https://youtu.be/_mOR5dus9wk)
2021-06-06 16:59:38,wallstreetbets,It was worth so much because China and Russia were so heavily invested in it. Thats also the reason they were allowed to go under. It'll never be the same with this company ever again.
2021-06-06 17:32:21,wallstreetbets,"Trump would have freed Fannie & Freddie, if he was smart.  I hope Biden does it but am not holding my breath, even though I own their shares."
2021-06-06 17:51:37,wallstreetbets,How likely are they to reverse this though? Realistically? This is a lottery type play?

2021-06-06 17:59:22,wallstreetbets,We are under a government that wants to line its pockets with as much tax revenue as possible. Freeing up profit to the free market or shareholders would be avoided as much as possible. Not going to happen.

2021-06-06 17:27:56,wallstreetbets,I can't find any new news since January. Can you post a link?
2021-06-06 17:07:00,wallstreetbets,Have you read some of the comments by the justices? One of them said “what do we do write them a check?” I’m assuming they’re referring to the excess of $100 billion they have taken past the loan with interest. Another justice said “how do you unscramble scrambled eggs”. I also believe the reason it’s taken seven months to come up with a decision is because it’s not just - a open and closed case. It’s very hard to decide how to make both companies whole again. How do they get capital back when released from the net worth sweep. I guess you could say I’m fucking optimistic :-)
2021-06-06 18:56:38,wallstreetbets,Coop?
2021-06-06 18:05:07,wallstreetbets,"Yes, preferred seems the play here."
2021-06-06 18:54:35,wallstreetbets,"The Trump failure to re-float FNMA is telling.

Given that Treasury revenue is down massively (thanks to covid) and the Biden administration's insistence on running massive deficits in the face of mid double digit trillion dollar national debt.  That net worth sweep is one of a handful of things keeping the US dollar propped up.  Think about that for a second.  I'm pretty certain that SCOTUS is going to receive a little ""out of band communication"" that basically says ""no re-float"".  Even if they do decide in favor of former share holders, the on-going litigation required to dislodge these GSEs back onto the capital markets will take years if not a decade or longer."
2021-06-06 16:59:31,wallstreetbets,"Question is will they ever be allowed to keep any profit for shareholders, been talk on Wall Street the past decade. Gov values it to much to just let it go."
2021-06-06 17:43:25,wallstreetbets,Let me introduce you to RKT..
2021-06-06 17:17:59,wallstreetbets,Supreme court has been doing opinions on Mondays and Thursdays throughout the entire month. They need to get this all done before their summer break. I’ve been waiting for a year already. A good friend of mine has been waiting for eight years. This is the ninth inning of the ball game. This shits almost over for everyone who has been waiting and waiting and waiting. I highly recommend following @scotusblog on Twitter. They do a play-by-play of opinions as they are released every 10 AM eastern standard time on Monday and Thursday.
2021-06-06 17:38:37,wallstreetbets,I completely agree. Since then they have changed a lot of their company policies. Fannie and Freddie we’re getting pretty crazy and partly responsible for the meltdown. However you can’t use a conservatorship as a regulation. You need to put in regulations for companies to follow and to thrive.
2021-06-06 17:36:06,wallstreetbets,There’s actually an interview about that. It was all political. Letting Fannie and Freddie free would add to the deficit. Since they knew this would soon be in the hands of the supreme court they decided to let the process run. That way you can’t point the finger at trump or any political party. It’s up to nine individuals now.
2021-06-06 18:37:40,wallstreetbets,The Supreme Court is predominantly red. Six justices were selected by Republican presidents. I like those odds. I also don’t think it’s realistic to use a conservatorship as a regulation in perpetuity to own a company. I believe they are claiming the third amendment on that one. I say they get out. Upside is enormous. Taking a two dollar stock all the way up to 80 is insane. If things don’t go the way I hope they do I say the stock loses 30 to 40% immediately. After a few months there will be another court filing and the stock goes up again to around two bucks. It’s been roughly at two dollars for the past 12 years. As long as you hold I don’t see how you lose money.
2021-06-06 18:22:22,wallstreetbets,So what's the verdict after that many years? Are we in or not?
2021-06-06 19:18:51,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the fun. I hold my breath every Monday and Thursday morning at 10 AM EST.

2021-06-06 18:03:54,wallstreetbets,"The justices don’t give two shits about the logistics, that’s not for them to figure out. The only thing they’re ruling on is whether taking them private, thus screwing shareholders, was constitutional.

They’ll figure out recapitalization and deferred interest later, but agreed those parts will be super messy."
2021-06-06 17:34:54,wallstreetbets,"It’s printing tendies for the government, the odds they relinquish control are incredibly minuscule. With a Republican majority in the Supreme Court  though there MAY be a chance."
2021-06-06 17:53:24,wallstreetbets,"I really don’t think the relatively measly profits going into the government are that big a deal. What’s $50bn a year with a multi-trillion dollar budget? My read is that this will figure approximately zero into the case, as it should, assuming the courts are fair. (They usually are pretty fair at the Supreme Court level, ans detached from politics. They are ideologically swayed of course, which is why justice selection is such a huge deal, but rarely political)"
2021-06-06 17:37:23,wallstreetbets,That’s what this is all about. If they get rid of the net sweep they can profit. The profits will no longer be swept into the government to spend without appropriation.
2021-06-06 18:00:29,wallstreetbets,"RKT isn’t an underwriter, they’re an originator. Big difference. They don’t make shit off interest rates, they’re a fee based business, and are this highly subject to the number or mortgages sold."

For example, issues can get remanded to lower courts which can cause a case to continue languishing for years.  Personally, I like the concept of this play, but as somebody who read lots of SCOTUS cases in law school, I wouldn't hold my breath that the matter will be fully resolved in the next couple of weeks.  Just food for thought on the timing.  That being said, I hope you get a home run, and get it quickly =)"

2021-06-06 18:51:31,wallstreetbets,You don’t understand how the Supreme Court works. They’ve heard the argument. Now they have to issue a decision. The Chief Justice can’t just yeet it into oblivion and not have it come back up
2021-06-06 18:42:29,wallstreetbets,Everything about this comment is wrong.
2021-06-06 18:14:58,wallstreetbets,"Stacking the court is about ideology, not the small politics of the moment. I’m not a liberal, I just pay attention to things.

I’ve never seen a case settled based on budget concerns, or obvious and major current political issues.

They stack the courts to try and get different rulings on large issues, like Roe v Wade."

2021-06-06 17:43:53,wallstreetbets,"just read OPs post. basically, DTC is a normalized measurement, ie. it is better comparable to other companies than other measures.

Example random company:

* shares sold short: 100M
* average volume: 50M
* days to cover: 100/50 = 2 (it would take shortsellers 2 days to cover if they were buying every share thats being sold)

so, to answer your questions:

* yes, if a stock has a high turnover (volume) compared to its float, the DTC will probably be small
* no, that does not mean it is a good measure of volatility. DTC measures short interest in relation to volumen. - it does not say anything about volatility."
2021-06-06 19:37:51,wallstreetbets,Thank you for that Ape. I appreciate it.
2021-06-06 16:51:59,wallstreetbets,Thanks mods for helping out and getting this posted! Not sure why it wouldn't go.
2021-06-06 17:00:08,wallstreetbets,CLNE to da moon. Legit growth company that is great for the environment. Add that oil prices keep rising and the RNG revolution is just getting started!!!!
2021-06-06 16:58:53,wallstreetbets,I like this stock. Please dont fuck this the WSB way.
2021-06-06 16:55:29,wallstreetbets,The best growth stock on the market!
2021-06-06 17:12:49,wallstreetbets,"Some FUDs out there trying to call CLNE a scam penny stock.  actual retards.  Aside from **Amazon**, CLNE also partnered up with tiny, small companies call **BP**, **UPS**, **Total** and **Chevron**!  Combine market cap for those 3 companies is OVER **2 TRILLION DOLLARS!**

edit: added more companies to the list of partnership"
2021-06-06 17:07:29,wallstreetbets,My 9200 shares are happy
2021-06-06 16:55:43,wallstreetbets,"I charge $20 for blowies, wife charges $50, wife’s bf charges $100. Different strokes."
2021-06-06 17:12:56,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. I'm in 
🚀 🌝"
2021-06-06 17:31:57,wallstreetbets,"own 500 shares last week, buying more monday!"
2021-06-06 17:08:29,wallstreetbets,"What is this??? A good post on wallstreetbets??? 
A meme that isn't absolute bullshit, I'm in!"
2021-06-06 17:43:36,wallstreetbets,"I‘ve been following CLNE since their IPO in 2007 and I always thought they were a buyout target from an oil major.  It certainly seems more likely now with shareholder activism ramping up (CLNE is positive PR for any oil major).  It’s also easier to justify with a higher crude price.  If we see a sustained $80-100 crude price in the next 12-18 months, CLNE becomes a much more valuable alternative.

The M&A cycle for oil and gas is very active right now.  I think the announced JV’s with BP and Total are obviously steps closer to an outright acquisition.  **I don’t think it’s overly-speculative to believe an oil and gas major will get aggressive with a bid.**  Not in this “carbon neutral “ environment."
2021-06-06 17:51:12,wallstreetbets,"Lets go guys, im a new investor in CLNE 8k shares in.  Lets spread the word this stock looking awesome"
2021-06-06 17:25:17,wallstreetbets,im in too and i got my whole family to buy clne stock
2021-06-06 17:36:58,wallstreetbets,Short and long gains. What's not to love?
2021-06-06 18:40:48,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn’t worry too much about the dilution. It’s at 13.49 and it only exercisable after Amazon significantly invests - to the tune of 500 million - current market cap is sub 2 billion. Meaning the stock price is gonna be a hell of a lot higher once this dilution happens, especially since the option to do so expires in 2031. Still a very safe play and shows the potential longevity. Loving how WSB is warming up to this"
2021-06-06 17:32:07,wallstreetbets,"The same people downvoting and berating $CLNE today will be asking us if it's too late to buy $CLNE tomorrow, mark my words."
2021-06-06 17:32:11,wallstreetbets,"This is great. Top-quality, well done 👍"
2021-06-06 17:05:54,wallstreetbets,"You guys bought high and sold low??? THIS past week??

How..."
2021-06-06 17:35:29,wallstreetbets,"They told me I was a clown for believing in this stock, we will see where is this CLowNE in 2 weeks"
2021-06-06 17:14:40,wallstreetbets,Lets go
2021-06-06 17:20:09,wallstreetbets,Very undervalued. Good play with a nice price floor and potential to shoot to the ROOF within the next couple of days
2021-06-06 17:28:16,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the DD. Love seeing an actual legit company with strong fundamentals on WSB. Buying shares in something that’s more than a meme is refreshing!
2021-06-06 17:43:51,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget the BP partnership as well. 🧼 🚀
2021-06-06 17:59:26,wallstreetbets,Bought in last week. Adding more at the opening bell.

2021-06-06 18:37:02,wallstreetbets,"Excellent DD. CLNE a solid medium-long term play, for sure."

2021-06-06 17:59:18,wallstreetbets,Haha just ride it up hop off and reinvest when the mania dies down?
2021-06-06 17:22:17,wallstreetbets,You forgot Total 🙂
2021-06-06 18:55:55,wallstreetbets,So they all have different strokes? Different experience at each pride level?

2021-06-06 18:04:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes, when those prices increase it makes the alternative fuel switching to CLNE products easier. Much like Coal power switching to Nat gas ,DUHHHHHH 🚀🚀🚀🍌🍌CLNE to the moon"

2021-06-06 18:32:45,wallstreetbets,This is going to do the game thing as AMC... which did the same thing as GME... and the next stock will do the same thing. It's going to be a fight to weed out the HFs and shorts. Be prepared for a few million+ share drops before we see the same action as AMC.

On Friday, your September calls were worth $5.65 each at mark. 6/11 calls @ $20 (for example) were selling for $0.95. You'd either collect a buck each at that strike, or be called away at $20. Not a bad outcome either way.

Even $29 calls on Friday were selling for \~ .50 each.

Not professional advice. I'm just someone who prefers to hit lots of singles and doubles rather than swing for home runs."

2021-06-06 16:34:20,wallstreetbets,"Fun fact: AMC’s original projectors were powered by hamsters in little running wheels connected to the gears. When projectionists needed to switch out a reel, they would take the (now tired) hamster out of the wheel, snap its neck and throw it in a trash bin, then replace it with a fresh hamster. At the end of the day, they would bring the bin of used hamsters out back behind the theater and throw them out to the homeless people that gathered there each day at closing hoping to get a free snack. One of those homeless people was a newly arrived German immigrant named Claus Von Schittstaïn, who so loved the taste of fresh hamster on a slice of bread that he would go on (after years of saving) to found the first HämsterShäcken in 1942. The restaurant was a fast hit, and soon there were Hamster Shacks (after a name change in 1947) all over the continental U.S. Today, you can find Hamster Shacks in Tokyo and Moscow—just part of a global empire of restaurants serving millions of customers every day."

2021-06-06 17:01:57,wallstreetbets,"The funniest part about AMC is that Retail claims to hold 80% of shares, Index funds hold most of the rest and for a week straight it trades 1.5-2.0 times it's total shares outstanding every single day. The only reasonable conclusion is HFT algos are churning the same shares over and over and over again then eventually dump the shares at a huge mark up to retail.

Who is one of the largest HFT's? Citadel. Kenny G. has made an absolute fortune marking up the same AMC share 100x before dumping on retail while retail thinks they are killing him.

7:00 : you are little nervous and little excited about tomorrow. Your amc/gme/bb positions are still in track with some loss in it.

9:00pm: you still keep reading "" I'm buying more at open reeeee"" posts and this gives you some hope.

11:00pm: you are about to go to bed. You check here last time before you put your phone on charge and close your eyes.

5:03am: your cat woke you up for food. You quickly check AH and see that price jumped at least 10%. This increases your heart rate and makes you calculate how much you can make today. 

5:05am: you are at bed but can't sleep. You open reddit and keep seeing moon emojies everywhere. You are a happy man and very excited. You slowly fall asleep

6:45am: your alarms goes on. You check AH and see that price is now 7% high. This is still okay you say. But your brain starts to feel something that is not right.

9:27am: you are at work. You are doing your work and on your second screen you are following stock and your robinhood/td ameritrade is on. Now price is at %5 high at AH and you are so nervous and so excited at the same time.

9:31am: your stock just dumped all and now you are - 1.5% down already. You are thinking to quit your option and just waiting for little jump so you can get the best price.

9:33am now your stock is up 3% and you are thinking it  is ""ShOrT SqUeZeEEee"" time and don't quit your option.

9:59am. You are down 12% and you close all apps/tabs and get back to work but you are very upset. You know that you fucked up again 17th time.

3:45pm: it is now fucking flat for hours. You are watching your options dying slowly.

- Ban any and all accounts under 90 days of age, or whose WSB posting history does not pre-date January 2021.

- Obvious exceptions made for flaired gentlemen.

- Limit the snappening to 4 million so you can claim it's random and dispassionate. ""But look at all the Apes who survived!""


#PROS 

- Massive and immediate increase in subreddit quality.

- Diversity of content and ideas.

- Don't have to pretend to be civil with Superstinkers and other meme subs anymore.

- I'll cum.

#CONS 

- Reddit admins probably won't do it because they fear progress.

- Fine, I'll do it myself.

The Global minimum tax might be tough on semis though as they pay one of the fewest taxes. I heard AMD pays 8-9%. The G7 made a deal for 15%. However, I do believe there are sections within the bill that give out tax free incentives to Semis for research and development, and other goodies! June 8th we get new GPU that will cost a lot but still way less than scalpers. So margins will go up for AMD and scalpers get wrecked. That won’t move the stock but good for margin gains. Then June 10th we get to see the first Plaids with AMD tech. I wouldn't buy weeklies because the MM always finds a way to lower price because they bought a shit ton of shares when this was $73. However, AMD has been chipping away 70 million dollars worth of buyback per day during the 4:00-4:10PM candle. I saw this action on the Lowe's chart. And, when it finally hit above resistance it went from 180 to 210."

Its pretty much a given that EVs are the future. it makes sense from environmental, economical, and political angles (tax credits etc). But theres certain applications that EV's aren't going to be able to fill. Mainly the long-haul trucking & delivery industry. delivery trucks run on a very tight schedule and currently electric semi trucks havent caught on because of the time it would take to charge them out on the road.

This is where CLNE comes into play. Long haul trucking companies are switching to Renewable Natural Gas. it has all the same environmental, economical, and political benefit of EV's. And natural gas refuels just as quickly as regular gas. This gives trucking companies a perfect alternative.

CLNE already has contracts with amazon, BP, Total and Metro (edit: also UPS)

So that was just the fundamentals. the long play. The quick play is the gamma squeeze at $13 thats ready to explode"

We are writing concerning your request for a stock certificate for Gamestop.  
For Gamestop we would transfer the shares out to the transfer agent. There is no fee from TD Ameritrade to transfer the shares out. Once the shares get to the transfer agent in about 7-10 business days you can call the transfer agent to request they print and send you a stock certificate.

2021-06-06 19:03:57,wallstreetbets,"The Senate will vote on the US Competition and Innovation act or Endless Frontiers on June 8th tentatively. This will be good for semis. The Global minimum tax might be tough on semis though as they pay one of the fewest taxes. I heard AMD pays 8-9%. The G7 made a deal for 15%. However, I do believe there are sections within the bill that give out tax free incentives to Semis for research and development, and other goodies! June 8th we get new GPU that will cost a lot but still way less than scalpers. So margins will go up for AMD and scalpers get wrecked. That won’t move the stock but good for margin gains. Then June 10th we get to see the first Plaids with AMD tech."

Volume translates roughly to Implied volatility for options trades if you’ve been losing on those, so finding low IV that will become high is the play. Hype is a great indicator of what will gain higher volume thus higher IV thus increasing options gains/ stock value. You have to guess what’s up next. My money is on CLNE"

HAGENS BERMAN Encourages Danimer Scientific (DNMR) Investors with Losses to Contact the Firm Now, Securities Fraud Class Action Filed

BY GlobeNewswire
— 9:35 AM ET 05/27/2021

SAN FRANCISCO, May 27, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hagens Berman urges Danimer Scientific, Inc. (DNMR) investors with significant losses to submit your losses now.
Class Period: Oct. 5, 2020 - May 3, 2021
Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 13, 2021

Danimer Scientific, Inc. (DNMR) Securities Fraud Action:
The complaint alleges that Danimer made misrepresentations and omissions concerning its production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (“PHA”) – a biodegradeable alternative to petrochemical-based plastics, which the company sells under its proprietary Nodax brand.
The truth began to emerge on Mar. 20, 2021, when the Wall Street Journal reported that “many claims about Nodax are exaggerated and misleading.” One quoted plastics expert labeled Danimer’s claims about Nodax’s biodegradability as “not accurate” and as “greenwashing.” 
Next, on Apr. 22, 2021, analyst Spruce Point published a scathing report noting: red flags; inconsistencies in Danimer’s claims about the size of its operations and Nodax’s makeup and degradability; and the company’s expected profitability.  
Then, on May 4, 2021, Spruce Point published another report after acquiring documents from Kentucky’s Department of Environmental Protection and accused Danimer of “wildly overstating” production figures, pricing, and financial projections.
Most recently, on May 21, 2021, news outlets reported that the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions had opened a formal inquiry into Danimer and Spruce Point’s claims.
“We’re focused on investors’ losses and proving Danimer misled investors by greenwashing and misstating its true performance metrics,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation."

This is all based on the current options chain and price, but if you buy 500 shares for ~$20k and sell 5 covered calls even at the $100 strike a month out you can reduce your cost basis by like $6k. If AMC stays flat you bag $6k in premium and keep your shares for moon mission. If it rockets you bag a 100% profit on the shares+ the premium. Roughly a $26k win. Even if the price drops $12 you’ll be break even with the premium collected"

2021-06-06 17:06:48,wallstreetbets,"The original thesis for the $CLNE gamma squeeze was basically if it can get to $13 (which is achievable because of how low its volume is), then it can shoot up to $30~ as insiders would have to buy over 2.8 million shares.

WSB was worried the $CLNE play was starting to resemble price manipulation and collusion.

Unfortunately for them, the $CLNE squeeze is inevitable

They're trying to hide the fact that there are so many contracts at $13. And there is no other way for MMs/institutions to hedge those positions without buying up more shares. 

It's simple. $CLNE hits $13, $CLNE moons

2021-06-06 17:38:17,wallstreetbets,So would I be dumb to purchase 6/18 $13 calls for CLNE?
2021-06-06 15:40:16,wallstreetbets,One step at a time. I remember trading the sector when oil was up what seemed like everyday all the way to $140/barrell. This time will be worse. We need $100/barrel first. Then the rush will come when investments will pile into the trade. Score for CLNE when that happens.
2021-06-06 17:52:29,wallstreetbets,"Go for it bro, but remember shares are key"
2021-06-06 16:44:35,wallstreetbets,Yes 100 barrel could definitely happen if investors start piling in and fomo will kick in
2021-06-06 19:45:31,wallstreetbets,"Oh 100%, I just don’t have the capital to be going big on shares to make a difference"
2021-06-06 16:46:28,wallstreetbets,It will hit $100/ barrel before FOMO kicks in in my opinion. Same happened last spike. It trended up slowly each day and once the $100 oil headlines were all over the place it went from $100 to $140 in a hot minute. FOMO kicked in.

2021-06-06 16:34:32,wallstreetbets,"Fun fact: AMC’s original projectors were powered by hamsters in little running wheels connected to the gears. When projectionists needed to switch out a reel, they would take the (now tired) hamster out of the wheel, snap its neck and throw it in a trash bin, then replace it with a fresh hamster. At the end of the day, they would bring the bin of used hamsters out back behind the theater and throw them out to the homeless people that gathered there each day at closing hoping to get a free snack. One of those homeless people was a newly arrived German immigrant named Claus Von Schittstaïn, who so loved the taste of fresh hamster on a slice of bread that he would go on (after years of saving) to found the first HämsterShäcken in 1942. The restaurant was a fast hit, and soon there were Hamster Shacks (after a name change in 1947) all over the continental U.S. Today, you can find Hamster Shacks in Tokyo and Moscow—just part of a global empire of restaurants serving millions of customers every day."

2021-06-06 17:08:06,wallstreetbets,"Its not even funny. Out of the three GME is the only one with solid DD. BB has some growth potential sure, but AMC especially is dead in the water

Are you aware of the DD proving that AMC is being used as a tool to hedge liquidity positions against GME?

DD isnt in favor of AMC squeezing comparibly to GME. There is a reason GME apes are negative about AMC and its not because we are ""jealous"" of OR angry at AMC.

At a price of $101.7 AMC will lose its usefulness, since then two shares of AMC are needed to hedge one share of GME, then quickly two or three. Quickly decaying its usefulness and there for buying pressure. This may either cause a small squeeze or instant sell-off and crash.

However, GME is the endgame squeeze. There is nothing else that has its unique properties like a small float, more than 100% short and even Michael Burry acknowledged so.

Read for yourself...
I Got What You Quant - 6/2/21 Trading Analysis and a Deeper Dive Into Today's Tape

Im not telling you what to do, but I honestly cannot understand why you would take a position when we have DD and observed proof that shows AMC is used as a liquidity tool to suppress the stock that you also hold and are hoping to squeeze. More is not better... Holding one good position is better than holding two when one is good and one is bad"

2021-06-06 17:15:29,wallstreetbets,"Vital facts about AMC that people keep glossing over:

The company issued a warning to retail investors who are looking to *buy the stock*.

They believe that you will be at the most risk, if you buy the stock. They don't have liability. They don't have a legal obligation to tell you that. You can't sue them. They told you because that's what their analysis leads them to believe.

Second, you're all focusing on the CEO being pantless. Good job, dumb dumbs. Maybe you should have paid a LOT more attention to two key takeaways: 

1) the CEO refused to discuss the MASSIVE $8-10bn of debt that AMC still has.  
2) the CEO outright said there are ***no synthetic shares of AMC in circulation***. That means *no naked short selling*.

Sorry for the long comment, but it needs discussing."
2021-06-06 16:58:11,wallstreetbets,"AMC. 

That fall from 50ish to 43 after market was dark pools selling positions. That 20% non-retail investor was exiting. 

The squeeze hasn’t happened. If we hold, we will see the squeeze happen (I hope to $100). 
That’s when the hedge money transfers to the retailer money. 

Just my opinion. Not a financial advisor and not financial advise"

2021-06-06 19:27:29,wallstreetbets,"/u/zjz I think there is a potential problem with this implementation

Looks like you get the top tickers from mentions in the daily thread. This will create a meme thread for gme amc for example, which will directly cause a major drop in these tickers' mentions in the daily (since discussion for these will be moved here)

So the next day the new top mentioned tickers will be, say, tsla / bb, and discussion of gme will be once more permitted. Until the next day again meme thread is gme amc, etc...

Basically you have alternating tickers for the meme stock thread every day"

It won't (come down) until positions are actually closed AND not reopened at the same time. You can't convince me, 6 months into this, seeing what we have seen that retail isn't going to just buy, hold, and squeeze anything meme-able with 10+% SI and respectable volume.

Just buy, hold, wait. Price could go down this week for all we know. You have the puts thing wrong. Puts are not shorts. And on SSR you can only short on an uptick.

You absolute morons upvoted this, but do you have any idea that those words **literally make no sense**.

The price dropped *because sells* ***hit the market***. Thats how the open market works, dumb dumbs. If more sells hit the market than buys, the price *goes down*.

If they were routed through dArK pOoLs then they'd NOT HIT THE MARKET. Well, there's a bit more nuance there... but the point is

Read a fucking book you idiots. And realise your company managed to peak at a market cap some **fifty five times greater than prepandemic levels**...

People are selling.

You did the equivalent of buying GME at 500, 450 and 350.

The difference is, Gamestop has a potentially very bright future as a company..."

If it does moon, and you missed it, you will hate yourself for not investing. If it crashes and you hold, it could moon one day. If you watch it sink (hint: it will sink before going up) and sell then you will never recover and people will always make fun of you for life, calling you a paper handed b*tch. I am holding.

2021-06-06 15:35:56,wallstreetbets,Bet. I’m buying some.  I have AMC and GME. I’ll get BB full tard
2021-06-06 18:47:12,wallstreetbets,Yes BB is the only thing that matters. If all goes to shit I’m holding until 2023. Literally cannot lose.

2021-06-06 17:10:51,wallstreetbets,AMC thread LMFAOOO. Amc is absolute pussy shit compared to GME. GME is real deal big league big boy shit.

2021-06-06 19:01:54,wallstreetbets,It will. Just eat your AMC popcorn and watch. I'm 89% confident thats exactly what will happen.
2021-06-06 19:17:31,wallstreetbets,Don't you meant through earnings? That's later in the month.

2021-06-06 18:40:06,wallstreetbets,Funny because wasn’t GME going bankrupt before their squeeze?
2021-06-06 19:12:12,wallstreetbets,"I hope AMC moons, holding.  However, I completely agree.  Unfortunately any business model that now has the added risk of completely being shut down with government mandated quarantines as a new standard is not in a good position and I don't really see a viable pivot for them."

2021-06-06 18:24:38,wallstreetbets,It’s either a massive rotation or massive distraction. Either way it’s a gamble so I’ll throw money at it. Why not

2021-06-06 18:34:17,wallstreetbets,"BB was nowhere near the short interest of GME or AMC. Both are still seriously primed. When BB also saw a jump in price they went ""We don't know why"" and had the worst offical response to the squeezes out of the companies.

The fact people say ""BB"" while ignoring AMC and GME is really fucking strange."

2021-06-06 16:22:26,wallstreetbets,"But how the tickers will go to the top if they are not talked about there? I'm guessing you can't count them on the popular thread, otherwise they'll never leave."

2021-06-06 15:54:08,wallstreetbets,*they're always watching*
2021-06-06 19:47:24,wallstreetbets,"Spark notes:

A short is when someone borrows shares on the condition they will pay those shares back. They then sell them at current prices, hoping the price eventually goes down, then buys them back and returns the shares. To do this, and borrow the shares, they pay a fee on these shares. So you're profitable when the stock drops a certain amount - whatever fees you added up. Therefore, time doesn't really matter. You can end up just paying these fees over time just hoping the stock goes down. As long as you can pay the fee you don't have to cover.

A put is only the same in that you anticipate the price of a stock to go down. But, a put contract is a done deal out of the gate and has a definitive date and fee set. The fee is the premium and the date is expiry. When you buy a put you are saying I will pay $x fee for the right to sell x shares of a stock at x strike price, by a certain date.

Example. ABC is trading at $15 and I think it's going to $10. I buy 1 put that expires at the end of the week at the $15 strike price. This means whoever sold me the put agrees to *buy* 100 shares of stock ABC from me for $15 / share (I don't have to own them, that's just the logic). When I bought the put the only money in I had to pay was the premium to have the right to make this agreement a reality if I'm right. If I'm wrong, I lose the premium and that's that, end of story, but it happens in that week. But, I was right, ABC went to $10 by the end of the week. I make money because now I get to *sell* ABC to that person who originally sold me the put for $15/share. So $1000 worth of shares, which cost me $10/share to get now, I get to now sell back at $15/share to that person I had an options contract with for $1500 and profit $500. ($1500 I sold for - $1000 it cost be to buy)

That's about as basic as I can lay it out. Hope that helps."
2021-06-06 16:48:08,wallstreetbets,one of the fundamental aspects of market makers is to hedge shares you idiot lmao
2021-06-06 16:47:38,wallstreetbets,🤣
2021-06-06 17:12:29,wallstreetbets,You bought in at $3?
2021-06-06 17:12:05,wallstreetbets,Nah bro gme doesn't even give their cost huge bonuses with every share offering instead of paying down their debt. How is gme going to survive if they keep paying off their debt?
2021-06-06 16:59:51,wallstreetbets,You wanna BBet?
2021-06-06 15:45:26,wallstreetbets,Try to get some now and lower the cost

2021-06-06 19:11:43,wallstreetbets,you can't afford GME?
2021-06-06 18:46:36,wallstreetbets,"actually no it wasn't....some people may have thought it was, but these were people that compared it to blockbuster and were grossly misinformed. Might as well say ALL B&M retailers are going bankrupt.

If you want to cheer for an AMC squeeze....go for it.....but don't say it has good business fundamentals and that some good box office openings will have an impact"
2021-06-06 18:43:29,wallstreetbets,">No, not at all"
2021-06-06 18:41:35,wallstreetbets,people get banned by a bot for submitting two sentence/rulebreaking content and think it's about GME just because the bad post happened to be about GME.

2021-06-06 19:54:54,wallstreetbets,"Why would it though ? Possibly if AMC explodes , but let’s be honest - BB is just riding the coattail. It has less short interest than AMC and literally nothing going for it besides 1000 bots posting on these forums"
2021-06-06 16:53:25,wallstreetbets,"Please lord,Make BB and AMC explode,then followed by GME,it would be the most beautiful thing we ever seen in our lifetime!"
2021-06-06 19:07:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm buying them all. Seriously.

Had GME and AMC. Now that some learning has occurred (aka, paper handed realized losses because I was trading this like they were fuckin' legit like AAPL or whatever and I'm big dumb) I'm hard in the BB paint. But, adding the following in batches of 100 shares (I sell CC's on this shit just in case) and just depending on how I feel or how a stock looks on price.

Seriously, no bullshit, if one is $10.50 and the other is $10.37 I'm buying the $10.50 because the number is more round and prettier. Fuck it. I seriously don't care who the company is, what they do, whatever.

Does it have decent volume based on the float? How big is the float? And what is the SI%? That is all I look at.

WKHS, CLOV, CLNE, MVIS, BB, BBBY, BLNK, ROOT, SKLZ, CLVS, RIDE, GOEV to name a few.

All it takes is one asshole to piece a bunch of letters together in a way that gets the people here swinging from treetop to fucking treetop and we are off. This will not change for some time until this new era in trading is ironed out and managed / controlled better by the ""pro's."" Until then, fuck your fundamentals and show me your SI baby.

Obligatory not financial advice, I'm an idiot, and I'm only using my gambling money, not on margin or mortgage cash, yet.

Edit - I'm going to smoke every last flake of fucking weed I have rn for not putting SNDL or TLRY on that list. Shame on me. Fucking downvote this bullshit for forgetting those gems."
2021-06-06 18:30:31,wallstreetbets,"AMC is dead after a run up to $70. Lmao. AMC is probably just as much, if not more shorted than GME. There has been a hell of a lot more volume and fomo with a lower price entry point on AMC. Every shorted stock is going up when the shit hits the fan. No apes left behind, except for you, because you’re a jerk."

2021-06-06 17:58:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but how far do you think they let those delta hedges run during a squeeze. They can get double fucked if they automatically buy shares on the way up a huge run, just to have it crater by the end of the day.

I mean we’ve seen some of that for sure over the past 6 months, but you know they’re tweaking those algos to work differently when these squeezes occur."

2021-06-06 17:59:57,wallstreetbets,they can do all the tweaking they want but at the end of the day if there is overwhelming amounts of calls being bought along with shares shit happens...it usually requires institutional backing for gamma squeezes to happen though which is why most are just pipedream gambling

2021-06-06 16:01:43,wallstreetbets,Yeah bro sell... 50-60k is enough for some new plays.. you even have a gain. For short term just take 10-15% gains before they go to -60%

2021-06-06 15:20:46,wallstreetbets,Buy more Amc

2021-06-06 15:20:03,wallstreetbets,Is that possible with Robinhood?
2021-06-06 15:27:59,wallstreetbets,Shares are different from options bud. Especially options 5 DTE. The last week is when Theta hits the hardest.
2021-06-06 17:14:40,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man, i hope this ends up working out.

Started off with 4k trading hype trains and from that i made 10k and threw them at AMC calls."

2021-06-06 15:21:38,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man, hopefully with all that happened this weekend it's just enough"

r/thetagang thanks you for your business."
2021-06-06 15:31:18,wallstreetbets,I use tda so not sure. Just sell what you have now and put it all to other calls. Yes the buy is more but is essentially same as rolling.
2021-06-06 15:29:25,wallstreetbets,O I understand the difference. Which is why I’m shares and not options now. Just trying to help fuel the rocket! Theta has bent me over a few times.
2021-06-06 15:22:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah huh. with that post market drop Friday, if AMC doesn’t recover in pre market tomorrow, these calls are going to drop hard AF"
2021-06-06 15:20:39,wallstreetbets,Ya nuh uh
2021-06-06 17:26:35,wallstreetbets,"So you're looking at about a $1,600 potential loss if they all expire worthless?"
2021-06-06 17:00:35,wallstreetbets,"They're options expiring this week, not shares!"
2021-06-06 16:02:32,wallstreetbets,So just the contract itself is holding the value not actual stock itself?
2021-06-06 18:58:42,wallstreetbets,Thank you sir
2021-06-06 18:15:59,wallstreetbets,I lold at this

2021-06-06 15:31:11,wallstreetbets,That’s why people are saying to sell. Because he currently has 60k in options that expire this Friday and quite a ways OTM
2021-06-06 15:25:17,wallstreetbets,got me there
2021-06-06 17:28:14,wallstreetbets,"Uhhhh no lmao.

30k of they expire worthless, the other 30k i have in long calls"
2021-06-06 17:01:29,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah well no option there to sell or they execute automatically, I rather just buy and hold the shares"
2021-06-06 16:02:42,wallstreetbets,I dont think theres usually a button for rolling.... sell and buy a later date or shares since u have a pretty high capital
2021-06-06 15:40:54,wallstreetbets,"“RH retard”

Yeah, that just about sums up all their users"
2021-06-06 15:37:24,wallstreetbets,"It's the same on all platforms, degenerate."
2021-06-06 15:34:27,wallstreetbets,"30k actually, it's only half.

Also all this money i made off of 4k so im chilling"
2021-06-06 15:33:27,wallstreetbets,Lol this is wallstreetBETS! Sell isn’t part of the vocabulary here. That’s for r/stocks
2021-06-06 18:08:24,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck. 🤣
2021-06-06 17:56:58,wallstreetbets,"You can sellback bought options, if they still have value and time..."
2021-06-06 18:10:16,wallstreetbets,I use RH.  Can confirm
2021-06-06 18:05:06,wallstreetbets,We all gotta start somewhere
2021-06-06 15:33:59,wallstreetbets,DFV would disagree.
2021-06-06 18:59:59,wallstreetbets,"Yea lmao, im chilling tho i started off w 4k"
2021-06-06 15:36:33,wallstreetbets,"Alright, checking back on Friday then. If AMC doesn’t hit $100 by Friday I’ll be back to give your DFV comment some gold!"
2021-06-06 19:35:19,wallstreetbets,"I’m spending too much time on Reddit and using all my coins today. Touché for using DFV against me! Still think it’s going to $100 by Friday, but don’t want to not be able to pay my bets if it doesn’t happen........people please pay your bills before you YOLO on this stuff. It’s fun but make sure you’re only betting what you can lose!! Family and Self care first!!!"

2021-06-06 15:59:48,wallstreetbets,It's a shame HITI can't be discussed on WSB. It's currently the best cannabis play (competition between growers will drive prices down leading for better margins of retailers -> hiti = market leader in cana retail) and gets dumped only due to lack of publicity.
2021-06-06 17:00:33,wallstreetbets,"Guys. Weedmaps (SSPK), ticker changing to MAPS next week. That’s the only MJ stock you need to follow ‘nuff said"
2021-06-06 15:10:11,wallstreetbets,Tilray is still set to benefit the most from US legalization as it is the largest canabis conglomerate in the world currently. Their infrastructure is already in place. Let's say hypothetically cars were illegal in Mexico and then overnight they weren't. Do you think Ford or a Mexican startup automaker would be immediately more successful in Mexico?
2021-06-06 15:29:24,wallstreetbets,Weedmaps will be on the market in a week.  Unfortunately it's still considered a 4 letter word.
2021-06-06 19:30:36,wallstreetbets,First of all tlry is a great investment at this price this stock will be $100 a share in 12 months they will dominate the industry and you have to remember hemp is what is important not cannabis everything in this world will be made from him house cars shoes Furniture clothes highways and they grow more hemp then anybody. Also remembered marijuana is legal in  about 18% of the world  marijuana will be a bigger industry then the pharmaceutical companies the oil companies the entertainment industry combine. Look up thermic paintSPAC company about to go public will revolutionize the paint industry.Look under omnicanna. Not sure on symbol yet.

2021-06-06 17:31:46,wallstreetbets,"Make the maths 
..tilray got the nr.1 company by proforma revenue after the merge 
... They got 2 us company ..food and beer ..
Not if , but when legalization will be on , not only us weed company will grow but also others company will take advantage of the sector ... tobacco , alcohol , clothes etc...so big us companys will deal with big weed company ..such like tilray ...diageo is interested to deal with tilray ...most probably will happens . Why ..well..do your own research, I already said to much ."

2021-06-06 15:39:10,wallstreetbets,"Sundial Growers Inc. (NASDAQ: SNDL). Under the new management, they have emerged from a penny stock into a company that boasts outstanding financials:  
\- They are sitting on \~$700M of unrestricted cash on their balance sheet.  
\- They're in the process of raising a further \~$800M.  
\- They have zero debt!  
They recently tied up with SAF Group - a Private Equity Firm to invest this raised capital to generate asymmetrically enhanced risk-return opportunities in the cannabis industry, in Canada, the US and Internationally. This puts them in such a sweet spot, allowing them to take over companies, capture worldwide market share and vertically integrate their business operations.  
SNDL as well as being a premium cannabis operator is focusing and strengthening its business model towards being a cannabis financier as well, where its able to deploy its capital into multiple market segments within the cannabis sector, across the globe. This is really smart as it allows them to increase their exposure whilst minimizing risk. I was really happy to see the deployment of funds into: acquiring Inner Spirit Holdings - Canada's largest single brand retailer & increasing stake into The Valens Co. I really look forward to seeing how the management invests the remaining funds - we strongly believe in the path they're following and firmly envision this company at the top of the chain in the cannabis sector.  
This restructured company has attracted huge institutional investment - including Morgan Stalney & Susquehanna Intl. both acquiring > 11M shares each. Plus millions more from: Citadel, POTX ETF, Credit Suisse etc.  
PS: this is not financial advice."

2021-06-06 14:46:43,wallstreetbets,"Curaleaf (CURLF) current price $14.91 

""Curaleaf's first quarter looked fairly straightforward to us, as both top line and profits continued to grow. Total revenue grew 13% sequentially and 170% year over year to $260 million. Higher volume helped gross margin expand about 100 basis points sequentially and more than 600 basis points compared with the prior year quarter to 49%. Further, operating leverage on overhead costs helped drive adjusted EBITDA to $63 million, up 16% sequentially and 213% year over year. Management provided full-year guidance of revenue of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of about 30%. We've maintained our prior forecast, which assumes the loWwer end of revenue quidance of just under $1.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of 31%.
With no changes to our forecast, our U.S. dollar-denominated fair value estimate remains unchanged at $25 per share. Our Canadian dollar-denominated fair value estimate falls slightly to CAD 30 per share from CAD 32, fully attributable to a stronger Canadian dollar since our last update. Our no-moat rating is unchanged given the early growth stage of the industry. Shares continue to look undervalued to us, offering investors attractive upside to the budding U.S. and European cannabis markets. We think the market may be overly focused on progress on federal laws, overlooking Curaleaf's continued strength in the fast growing U.s. market.
Curaleaf remains well-positioned for even more growth in the U.S. Since our last update, New York legalized recreational cannabis. Curaleaf already operates in the medical market there, so the company should immediately see higher growth in the state. This is similar to the growth the company has begun to generate in Arizona, where recreational sales began this year, and New Jersey, where recreational sales were legalized earlier this year. We continue to expect recreational consumption will eventually be allowed in Pennsylvania and Connecticut, other states where Curaleaf already operates.""

2021-06-06 15:47:45,wallstreetbets,"As a management company with WSB provided capital (diluted to all hell when WSB jumped on them) they may do ok with the right acquisitions. But as a cannabis company, they're shit.

2021-06-06 14:54:53,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man! I’ve been debating Curaleaf as well. They seem promising. I’m not just banking on laws but I know that if and when it’s approved, all the rich will spike the stocks and we’ll be priced out. I want to support their needs and stimulate growth now. There are also laws preventing banks and other institutions from holding money when cannabis is not federally legal. They can’t use that money nationally and you can’t mix that money with other profits outside of a “legal” state. Kind of went off the side here but just had a perspective on the situation, even with WSB maybe not wanting to support cannabis stocks cause of the gray area."

2021-06-06 14:49:00,wallstreetbets,"They’re big but here’s a quick summary I found.

Tilray is a Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company, incorporated in the United States with primary operations headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. Tilray also has operations in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Portugal, and Latin America."
2021-06-06 17:30:47,wallstreetbets,They have absolutely no way of getting in without buying MSOs and they burn money every quarter so idk why a well managed profitable MSO would sell to a smaller dumpster fire company when we finally do get legalization and it’s way way way easier to operate
2021-06-06 15:41:38,wallstreetbets,"I’m watching GRWG didn’t know enough about them. IIRP is a manufacturer/producer of materials for the industry correct? They’re stock is up there. Square is one I heard is good for supporting cannabis because of their payment system use, obviously. Haha"
2021-06-06 14:32:53,wallstreetbets,So I’m looking into companies mainly dealing with THC based products and some also produce and distribute CBD. CBD is also not regulated the same and is considered legal enough to be sold at a grocery store. The boom I’m focusing on is the government approval of cannabis throughout the U.S.

2021-06-06 15:48:41,wallstreetbets,Yep!!! Following them.
2021-06-06 18:19:15,wallstreetbets,"What licenses? You're talking out of your ass. The only license related to cannabis that currently exists is a DEA issued license for research. Nothing to do with legalization, regulation, business etc. Tilray is the first company to ever receive approval from the DEA to ship cannabis products into the United States from Canopy Growth to a federal research partner. In other words, they already have a working relationship with the Federal Government.
When regulation is instituted they will absolutely be the first foreign company to be issued any sort of license or grant to import products and will probably have minimal red tape due to USMCA and their existing working relationship. With operations in Australia, Germany and South America they are the largest international cannabis group. Period.

Even if that weren't the case, they could very well bypass any bureaucratic bullshit anyway simply by forming partnerships and subsidiaries in the United States operating as American businesses."
2021-06-06 14:34:14,wallstreetbets,"Nice, I’m going to look that up right now. Thanks!

2021-06-06 15:09:35,wallstreetbets,"Planet 13 is interesting. Their previous quarterly report was a bit weak, but that was mostly due to the lockdowns.

2021-06-06 16:25:17,wallstreetbets,"They are among the leaders in the race to expand around the world. They just had a record Q1 that they announced mid-may. They have a tonnnn of outstanding shares ready to be bought. There's much more about them but full Disclosure I entered a position of 1,000 shares at around .071 cents/share. I'm planning on holding at least 4 years, which is the timetable they expect to have Bophelo (a subsidiary) up and running as one of the largest worldwide suppliers (located in Lesotho, South Africa). They have also just been rapidly growing since starting up, which I see as a good sign as they make progress toward erasing their current debt

Edit: their debt has undoubtedly come from them gathering resources and expanding, and mostly operating costs. I expect their projects to bring enough revenue to make it a non-issue possibly in a year's time. Also like 99% sure much of the debt was purchased from a company that they bought out within the past year (Winberry Farms)

2021-06-06 15:52:20,wallstreetbets,"Even without laws, Curaleaf is crazy dominant. They're killing it right now and it's only going to get better. The lack of federal laws is probably a net benefit to them. Helps them maintain their moat a while longer and continue to grow stronger (same with GTII/CL/TRUL).

The fact that the big fish can't get in right now due to the Fed laws is a gift to retail getting in early."

The ones you need to operate in every state that has legalized. Nearly all the states had awarding processes that are LONG gone, with a few states having open licensure but highly saturated like Florida. Why would any profitable US based company sell their licenses to a failing Canadian company. Do you even know how to read a financial statement? Clearly not considering they lost -361 million dollars **this year** so far with flat revenue growth, while US companies grow 25% q/q.

No senator is going to vote to give up their state economy to Canadians.

The MSOs are assisting Chuck in writing the laws which, according to Chuck, are specifically designed to keep alcohol out (I.e. Busch/Tilray, Coors/HEXO, CGC/Constellation).

They will still likely have extremely high taxation until we remove it from the controlled substances act. 

Not sure if Chuck has the 60 votes to pass full legalization because the Biden admin plans to veto, and republicans will filibuster so he needs 60 instead of 50 votes. But as some may have seen, Amazon just began lobbying for legalization.. so things could get interesting. They, of course, have a lot of politicians in their pocket."

“Healthcare lacks appeal”... you don’t understand the different types of coverage within the field. Nor did you shed light on how CLOV is different. 

“Fierce competition” = sales people and quarterly targets. Clov fucks this up by innovating. If a goliath wants to play, they are welcome to acquire CLOV for $420.69 pr share. 

“Hindenturd report”. Check the track record of that firm. What a complete joke. Disputed and getting everything wrong. 

If you dislike CLOV this much, open a short position."

2021-06-06 14:19:16,wallstreetbets,"WSB never really needed a financially solid company. Yeah it helps but look at the stocks that have been hit here before, Hertz, WKHS, and even AMC during a pandemic. Many other stocks have been big contenders with worse news. CLOV has a chance especially with 40%+ short interest. 

Where it goes can not be for sure but DD like this is good but sometimes lots of good DD doesn’t always mean you are right. It really depends on if it can get picked up and things like BB are dropped."

2021-06-06 17:59:46,wallstreetbets,"I will put here my DD as I did in other reddit subchat. You are welcome to debate any data. I will be glad to share where I got the information.

Clov revenues are growing more than 20% per year. They have Chelsea Clinton and the former director of Medicare Demetrius Kouzoukas on the board. They have 700 millions on cash from the SPAC merger to accomplish their growth plan. The Clover Assistant is much more solid that the Hindenturd report said. That's about fundamentals. About the possible Squeeze...According to S3 Partners the SI is 46,67M shares (41,38% of free float, updated 4th of june) and this time it's right (not like when they discount the CEO class b shares out of the class a float). Even could be higher because they are not taking out of the free float the shares that the ETF based on MSCI small cap added last week and they should because this ETF can not sell this stocks without selling all the other stocks on the ETF as far as clov keep being part of it. If we consider this, the % of SI could be higher than 45% of the float. Also the institutional investor owns 55% of the free float. If you see nasdaq website it say it's 106% but it is an error because they count the 96M shares of Greenoak as class a shares but they have class b shares (class b shares are non tradeable and are not part of the float). Last but not least, clover will be added to Russell 2000. The ETF will have to buy more than 10M shares (9% of the free float). If we take out this shares of the free float when they buy it and the shorted stocks remain the same as now the SI will be 54% of the free float after 25th of June. I am not a financial advisor, just a Spanish engineer that love stocks market. If you want my opinion, I recommend to everyone to save money and on 23rd and 24th of June buy like my wife on sales, so the ETF based on Russell 2000 will have to buy it much more expensive because they have to buy more than 10M shares yes or yes.

Just like there are bullish cases for AAPL there are also bearish cases... This can be said for literally any stock. This report doesn't even say it's a ""bearish case"".

2021-06-06 19:21:43,wallstreetbets,"Which is so weird.. after the AMC boom it noticeably became divided here, seems like its people who missed out on AMC versus people who dont want the next boom to be BB and want to keep attention on AMC.

Either way im just watching from the sidelines, im for both we all want to make money, doesnt hurt to support both and the godfather GME at the same time. 

People have to realize we wont get anywhere with the divison in thought, but id be lying if i didnt say the chaos is entertaining lmao."
2021-06-06 17:18:58,wallstreetbets,"OP likely bought before the stock had reached that strike price. Some people buy options at the money (ATM) aka at or very close to the strike price because it has a high probability of it going in the money (ITM) and becoming intrinsically valuable, meaning the contract can be used to do something useful. A contract that is in the money can be exercised at any time to buy 100 shares at the strike price, whereas an option out of the money (OTM) is technically worthless - its only value is the time value it has before it expires. Also, if you’re really bullish on a stock, you could buy an option that is already $3 in the money, but it seems like a poor use of capital because you could just as easily buy one at the money at a big discount. Hope this helps clarify some things for ya."
2021-06-06 13:22:50,wallstreetbets,"Exactly , now I’ll hold forever !"

2021-06-06 17:12:59,wallstreetbets,They literally just spam the same BB comments over and over. I asked them for a screenshot of their positions a while back and nothing.
2021-06-06 13:58:15,wallstreetbets,Compromised by? The BB gang?
2021-06-06 14:34:49,wallstreetbets,Lol I honestly thought all the apes were in GME.
2021-06-06 13:22:28,wallstreetbets,"I looked into BB when people were hyping it back in the January GME run up. It should be a solid long term play. Shares are worth owning, but these short term options are a hell of a dice roll. Heck, I sold 30c covered contracts earlier last week for more premium than OP’s 12.5c contracts are worth right now."
2021-06-06 14:10:37,wallstreetbets,"Last reported short percentage (I think either Wednesday or Thursday at the latest. With what happened on Thursday and Friday, I’m thinking that it has probably gone higher. The short squeeze might not be as enormous as other stocks, but it could still be squeezed perhaps."

2021-06-06 14:31:47,wallstreetbets,"I think at best it might get a gamma squeeze, but that also could have been the spike to 20 the other day. Possible it could happen again this week, but it depends on how much price action we see in the next day or two."
2021-06-06 13:31:13,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t help the massive influx of bots pushing AMC/BB/CLOV.
2021-06-06 14:10:44,wallstreetbets,Oh please. Stop with you gamma shit. If everyone buys calls and to stocks there will be no fkng gamma.

2021-06-06 19:06:29,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't ""no one buying"" at 159 either? Hell ""no one was buying"" at 59

I'm buying that's who, because OPs stock mention is an easy 30b marketcap if anyone looked honestly, which it will be after a few more earnings release(looked at honestly that is).  Without getting into anything else, it's basically free money that keeps printing until an honest market cap is reached(which is inevitable turning brick and morter sales into same day shipping e-commerce sales, it won't be ignored).  I think after next earnings with debt erased, 30b market cap is not out of the question.  I'd tell you about the short interest but you've probably heard."
2021-06-06 14:09:54,wallstreetbets,That is true ape commitment

2021-06-06 14:38:10,wallstreetbets,True. I do like the sound of BBrothers though.
2021-06-06 14:37:40,wallstreetbets,"Covered calls on meme stocks has been my play since watching GME. Wish I had gotten into that early enough to have enough shares in my account approved for options trading. BB and AMC have sat at a nice price point to pick up blocks of 100. Price spikes 10-20%, immediately sell OTM weekly contracts or ITM if I’m feeling lucky.  Worse case scenario if calls execute, I lose the shares at a substantial gain to my entry price but I may lose out on upside. More often than not the contracts expire worthless so it’s been free premium."

2021-06-06 15:40:35,wallstreetbets,I threw in $5k.  Yolo really means just that you only live once.  Some guys who threw a lot of money into gme into that epic squeeze and lost a lot were coming to the penny subs all pissed and looking for way to make it back but didn't they understand they yolo'd that money?   They're supposed to invest money they won't need for forseeable future and not recklessly throw into because of a meme post.  BB is gonna see $100 and eventually $200.  It's severely undervalued.

And BB itself was a thing here since wayyyy before that."

You know how much easier it is for a HF to buy hundreds of millions of shares of bb instead of AMC or GME?"
2021-06-06 19:12:45,wallstreetbets,I like the stock. I traced my mouse over the chart many times and decided it felt nice.

2021-06-06 13:51:16,wallstreetbets,I was too hot out the gate and people have too much brand loyalty and confirmation bias. Fundamentals is not the play right now.
2021-06-06 13:06:46,wallstreetbets,"It's OK, I understand you're frustrated, but this is a casino. Some people want to play blackjack, you want to play craps...it's not a conspiracy. 

Like I said, go look back at Jan....BB was a thing, so was GME, so was AMC, so was NOK...so was PLTR...have made money or broke even on them all. 

People who are simply frustrated usually aren't so aggressively toxic though, so I do think there's some anger issues going on. Hope you can work through it to a happier place and that you don't treat people in your real life like that."
2021-06-06 15:18:52,wallstreetbets,Keep crying lmao. You're new to WSB.
2021-06-06 13:56:45,wallstreetbets,"Trust me man I'd love for us to be wrong about this.  I have my liquidity waiting to jump back on but I'm going to have to see the evidence required first.

I'll probably buy the stock again either way.  In the last few months I've learned much more than I ever care to know about this company.  If it falls to 8 again I'm just as much of a customer as I would be if it jumps to 16 on Monday and continues to rise with the others or better yet set itself apart in a good way instead of just following along and lagging behind the other meme plays.  


No problem being late to the party.  Just don't commit to be first to a party that sucks."
2021-06-06 13:12:44,wallstreetbets,"And trolling you aside, the amount of BB posts the mods allow is alarming. They don’t even moderate posts that are BB posts. Anything goes. And market watch literally says to buy it. NOT the way to go."

Well over a $600k loss, it was heartbreaking. Honestly, I hope she's ok. Didn't sound well in the comments... Infinity losses are real.

2021-06-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is appealing the Russell Inclusion to correct the amount of voting shares. This is just an update for UWMC holders. UWMC wasn't on the first Russell preliminary list due to issues with the voting shares. (Russell miscalulated). This stock is plagued with Russell inclusion issues. First quarter, everyone thought it wasn't included due to the miscalculation of voting shares but it was because they came out as a SPAC and something regarding the SPAC and being listed that way, they weren't able to be listed in the first quarter. They're supposed to be added to this inclusion and now the voting shares were miscalculated like everyone thought was the reason in the first quarters listings. Now, it is in fact the voting shares which were miscalculated. I've sent an email to investor relations and received the response below that they're appealing it. I don't really care if they're added or not, but I'm happy that they jumped on it, we'll see.

2021-06-06 18:20:56,wallstreetbets,"You might think Russell inclusion is a big deal but exclusion is a bigger deal.  The index weighting of companies is relative to float not market cap, so the indexers and closet indexers would be adding a few million shares to their funds to reflect the hundred million share float, a small fraction of the 1.6B shares outstanding.  Whats better for $UWMC shareholders would be completing the 300M$ buyback and retiring those shares. In order to maintain Russell compliance UWMC could only buyback about 20M shares and at VWAP of the stock since the buyback started and would probably mean around half of the buyback could be completed.  If they are excluded from the Russell, they don't need to worry about the min float threshold, buyback the full 300M$ and reduce the float by a third in a couple months time, right when short interest is getting dangerously high.  Much like GME, UWMC is a company for the people, instead of working for the little guy in gaming UWMC's mission is to help everyday imdependant brokers compete and beat the big banks on mortgage originations and save money for the little guys buying a home.  The CEO hates the shorts, has basically said he likes his stock, fuck the Russell, if he completes the buyback and tweets out an ice cream cone or whatever, he could take UWMC from an under the radar WSB play to a full blown meme.  When you're fighting for the little guy its better to be a meme than a Russell, fuck the index.

2021-06-06 18:39:23,wallstreetbets,"I like what you wrote, but one thing to add or clarify. With the buy backs the shares are retired meaning they’ll be completely removed, therefore, percentage wise, the float won’t change. It’ll stay 5.6% public float as the shares are retired once purchased by UWM regardless if they do the whole 300M buy back or not it’ll just reduce the total outstanding shares. This is my understanding of it as they’ve confirmed with the buy backs that the shares are retired.

Edit: I’m a smooth brain and made a mistake. Buy backs definitely does reduce the public float %."

But that's not the only reason I am writing this. I also want to inspire those of you who are just getting started in this game. For those who say that retail investors can't consistently make money in markets, I present you with some recent gain porn for your viewing pleasure. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyvyzp0yln371.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf56089ae7e9cff017cacdc546e9aa3c9e55f329

Look, I won't lie, making money investing is not easy -- lots of smart people are trying to do the same thing. But the real challenge is having the emotional resilience to stick with your thesis, and while not easy, if you stick to basic math and only invest in what you know, it is simple. 

As retail investors, we have a huge advantage over the big guys on Wall Street who need to hug the benchmarks, satisfy investor demands for quarterly results and invest only where they can expect to generate acceptable ""risk-adjusted"" returns where risk is bizarrely defined as ""volatility"", instead of permanent impairment of capital, which is how I see it. 

We can arbitrage these structural weaknesses in institutional portfolio management by making contrarian bets on stocks that are currently out of favor with the big guys, provided we've done our homework on the business and believe that it is undervalued. Eventually, if we are right about the trajectory of the business, they will eventually be forced to buy us out at a huge premium when the results prove out and herd mentality kicks back in the other way. 

I've made a nice chunk of coin on several positions over the last few years, which has enabled me to make bigger investments, and I am currently up materially on my latest portfolio positions. These are positions I have held for long time periods, with Bed Bath and Beyond being the largest position, the longest held and highest percentage gains. In my view, it also has the most upside, so I want to share a bit more with you about my thesis.

**Nothing I've said or am about to say should be construed in any way as investment advice.** **This is just me sharing my YOLO, with an explanation for my thesis.** 

Bed Bath and Beyond was a successful business when it first arrived on the scene, practically creating and defining the concept of Big Box Retail. As so often happens in life, their huge initial success bred complacency, and the co-founders (Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein) who continued presiding over the Board basically ran the company like it was their private piggy bank, without regard for small (or even large) shareholders. 

Under the leadership of Steven Temares, the CEO they handpicked, the business failed to innovate and keep up with basic changes taking place in retail -- such as the rise of e-commerce. BBBY began to see online giants like Amazon and even brick & mortar mass merchants like Target and Lowes begin to eat their lunch. Steven Temares, along with the rest of the c-suite, continued to receive huge salaries and bonuses, while the two co-founders received generous perks like personal black-car chauffer services, all paid for by the company -- and therefore, shareholders. 

They also refused to answer basic questions posited by Wall Street research analysts on earnings calls, seeing the investment community essentially as a nuisance to be tolerated but not proxies for the true owners of the business -- public investors. 

Well, the situation got so bad that finally, circa mid-2019 in the year of our chimp lord, a trifecta of activist investors led by Legion Partners (founder was trained by legendary activist Nelson Peltz) and John Duskin at Macellum Capital decided to wage war, buying up \~6% of the stock and filing a 170 white paper detailing all of the problems with how the company was being run and proposing to replace the entire Board of Directors and management team with its own slate of nominees. The presentation, which is phenomenal, is posted here:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189519001180/ex1dfan14a09050028_04262019.pdf

They went so far as to create a website for their campaign, [restorebedbath.com](https://restorebedbath.com/), which they eventually dismantled after reaching a cooperation and settlement agreement with the Board of Directors. This agreement effectively ceded control to the activists, who proceeded to replace everyone. It was a real Red Wedding style bloodbath... I mean total scorched earth policy... no respect for life. While it's never pleasant seeing people get canned, these people deserved it. After years and years of unaccountable shareholder abuse, someone finally came along and pulled out the game cartridge, blew on it and hit ""reset"" on the console. And they saw that it was good. 

In November 2019 they announced Mark Tritton, legendary Chief Merchandising Officer from Target who was the main person responsible for their massive success in developing private label / owned brand programs, would be taking the helm as CEO. Since taking charge, Mark has consistently been executing on the playbook laid out by the activists in their white paper, which basically calls for making low risk / high return changes to bring Bed Bath and Beyond up to modern retailing standards using well established best practices. 

While some would argue that a turnaround of this magnitude carries high execution risk, I would disagree at this time for several reasons: (1) The changes they have been making are actually quite well established strategies for modern retailing, with loads of case studies to pull from (Best Buy, Target, Lowes, etc); (2) they have the best team you could ask for implementing these changes (i.e., Mark Tritton and John Hartmann, who became COO of BBBY after a highly successful run as CEO of True Value hardware chains); (3) their compensation is heavily geared towards stock compensation, so **they only win if we all win;** and (4) most of the highest risk action plans, like divesting of non-core assets, culling unproductive / unprofitable stores, reducing bloated headcount and liquidating stale inventories at reasonable valuations, are all in the rear-view mirror. 

As of June 2021, Bed Bath and Beyond is at an inflection point with a strong focus on driving profitable growth from its core business lines. This comes down to a few very important strategies: (1) focusing on digital first, omni-always capabilities (leading with the website and mobile app but making sure they are able to serve customers however, whenever and wherever they want to shop -- think curbside pick-up, same-day delivery and buy-online pick-up in store aka BOPIS); (2) focusing on key destination categories where the company is seen as an authority in the home, driving preference for BBBY over other chains and even national brands by defining its key categories using data and developing owned brands to fill out their assortment in those areas (they have launched 6 so far this year, with another 4 expected by end of year -- ultimately they expect 30% of their sales to come from the brands they have created). This will help help them in multiple ways. First, the products are only going to be available at BBBY, so they are re-establishing their authority in the home and preference for BBBY as a brand and not just a venue to shop other manufacturers' products (this also means these items can't be bought online except for thru BBBY, so it is Amazon defense playbook 101). Second, these products have been strategically developed in areas where they had gaps in their assortment relative to the competitors they were losing share to. As mentioned above, development of these brands was informed by **data**, including detailed line reviews and purchasing data. Third, and final, these products are designed to cost and have very healthy margins that should improve the overall margin profile of the business as they are rolled out. This fireside chat with Mark Tritton from January 2021 explains it all far better than I can, and is well worth watching for curious apes: 

[https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/)

**So where does this all leave us today?**

The company has successfully implemented its digital first, omni-always capabilities, rolling out BOPIS, curbside pickup and same-day delivery (just signed up deals with Instacart & Doordash). Digital sales were up 86% in the most recent quarter and 99% in the Bed Bath banner (they also own Buy Buy Baby, which is the largest national baby retail chain in the US with the bankruptcy of Babies R US -- this alone makes BBBY an interesting investment with tons of hidden value).

For the first time in **years**, the company began posting positive same-store sales for the last 3 quarters under Mark Tritton (consistently comping up in the mid-single digits). This is a very positive sign of the changes taking place already. Same-store sales metrics are probably the most important data point for retailers, as it basically tells you if consumers think they have a good reason to exist. Quite frankly, it is an extraordinary achievement by Mark and his team that after years of declining same-store sales they are now positive for 3 consecutive quarters, and I don't think this has gotten enough attention.

They have also begun launching their new owned brands, with 6 already launched and another 4 or so on the way this year. These brands have a strong focus on their top 5 destination categories (bedding, bath, kitchen & food prep, indoor decor, and organization) -- I've personally purchased and used these products, and they are excellent quality at reasonable price points. I think they will do great.

They are repurchasing $1bn of their own stock (at least $375mm completed so far at an average price of \~$23 per share, reducing their share count from \~126mm to \~109mm.

Normalizing their revenues for divested brands and culling of unprofitable / lowest productivity stores in their footprint, management has guided to \~$8.2bn of sales and $525mm of EBITDA **this year,** with sales comping up in the low- to mid-single digits range for the next several years and EBITDA margins improving to high single digits / low double digits resulting in EBITDA of $850mm-$1bn by YE 2023.

Applying simple mathematics and established standards of value, I believe the evidence shows that businesses in this industry (big box and specialty retail) would typically be valued at \~8-12x EBITDA which would imply an enterprise value (value of the whole business, not just the equity) of \~$9bn at the midpoint, which seems eminently reasonable for an iconic retailer under solid leadership with about 1000 stores and authority in key growing segments of the US economy.

Since they have virtually the same amount of cash as debt, the enterprise value should be about the same as the equity value, so \~$9bn at the midpoint above. With \~109mm shares outstanding today, that puts implied equity value per share at \~$82, but where it gets even more interesting is if you factor in the share buybacks. They've still got $625mm of remaining authorized share repurchases under their existing program, and depending on how cheap they are able to buy those shares they could materially reduce the share count further.

**So why are the big institutional investors continuing to ignore this stock? Why does everyone continue to ignore the insanely cheap valuation and upside potential under the extraordinary new leadership of Mark Tritton, John Hartmann and the rest of the new team?** 

I can think of several possibilities, but probably the main one is a backward looking bias, because the memory of the old management team and their awful performance dies hard. Their prolonged period of value destruction also gave rise to a narrative, parroted widely by thematic investors and talking heads on CNBC, basically a nonsense theory that all brick & mortar would die and the consumer would only ever want to shop at Amazon (somehow ignoring blatantly contradictory evidence provided by Target, Lowes, Walmart, etc). 

In this excellent interview with burgeoning hedge fund manager Dan McMurtrie (aka Supermugatu), he discusses the reality of how Amazon is killing bad retail, not all retail, and how certain investors / the media have taken the the idea way too far as they so often love to do. **I cannot recommend this highly enough -- well worth watching beginning at 39:45.**

[https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge](https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge)

It might take some time for BBBY to shake off the worries created during the former management team's tenure. Most of the time, the stock market is forward looking, but in this case investors have adopted a thesis that has them psychologically stuck in the past due to PTSD, and the distractions in rear-view mirror are blinding them to what is likely to happen in the next 6, 12, 18 months. 

Eventually, I personally expect BBBY to shock the market with positive results one of these quarters, forcing a rapid, seemingly unexpected valuation revision in the stock. They have already begun to put up excellent numbers, if you look at the underlying same-store sales, digital growth, growth in top 5 destination categories, for example. However, there has still been a lot of noise in the numbers from divestitures, culling of store footprint, COVID impact in 2020, etc., and it appears that perception has not caught up yet with the new reality.

While I haven't focused on it much here, the company also has an excellent balance sheet with over $1bn of cash, no meaningful near-term debt maturities, solidly positive free cash flow generation & very high short interest.

Even with all of the prevailing negative sentiment, this has been a profitable investment for me so far (I purchased heavily in periods where others abandoned hope over the last few years). In my opinion, the company is probably worth about $80 / share as of today, however with continued solid execution and more enthusiasm coming back into the name, I could see this valued well into the triple digits. 

So, even with my sizeable gains I haven't sold one share and don't plan to anytime soon. I am holding this baby to the end."

2021-06-06 13:28:59,wallstreetbets,"I have been looking at BBBY but I think it's recent rise has been too fast. It doesn't belong here yet. Therefore, I opened put spreads expiring in the next 2-3 weeks. Eventually, I will buy some LEAPS. I don't know if it's worth what you think it is, but I like the idea of a turnaround, because previous management was terribad and new management should be better (it's not hard to be). However, 1) It'll take time for them to implement their plan 2) everyone and their wife and wife's boyfriend seems to have stacks and stacks of coupons, lowering their profit margins 3) like you said, the market doesn't like the stock yet. The shine of meme stocks is fading on this one

I personally believe that just like when GME first spiked, a lot of shorts in other companies covered, which in this case, probably meant BBBY again. I think that it's only going to be a short time before the shorts jump back in. WSB will get excited with the prospect of a ""short squeeze"" (debatable, b/c the price rise could be shorts exiting rather than retail frenzy), but boomers and regular investors will stay away from BBBY in the very short term b/c they will believe that it has run away from fundamentals.

TLDR: I believe in them but they haven't proven themselves enough yet. I bought puts and will buy LEAPS later when it comes back down to earth. If I owned the stock, I would sell now and buy back in later at a lower cost basis and wait for either another rocket or the slow climb up"

""... it has signed a product and service agreement with ServiceNow, the leading digital workflow company making work, work better for people. The agreement includes Fisker's purchase of ServiceNow's IT Service Management (ITSM) Pro and Software Asset Management (SAM) solutions to deliver seamless experiences for Fisker's employees.""

""*With President Biden’s proposal to invest $174 billion in electric vehicle (EV) development, the domestic EV industry could witness solid growth soon despite short-term hurdles such as a global semiconductor chip shortage. Supportive government policies and regulations worldwide should also contribute to the industry’s growth. As a result, Wall Street expects the shares of EV makers Fisker (FSR) and Electrameccanica (SOLO) to gain more than 80% over the next 12 months. Read on for details.""*

""In March 2021, FSR announced that it had agreed with Crédit Agricole Consumer Finance--which is part of the Crédit Agricole Group, the leading financial partner to the French economy and one of the largest banking groups in Europe--on the potential supply of Fisker Ocean SUVs. The agreement would give employees and the private banking market access to Fisker Ocean, with its latest generation technology and performance, while reinforcing Crédit Agricole’s commitment to a low-carbon fleet.

For the first quarter, ended March 31, 2021, FSR reported $22,000 in revenue. Also, the company’s net cash provided by financing activities came in at $88.74 million, compared to  $145,000 in the prior-year quarter.

Analysts expect FSR’s revenue for 2022 to be $416.58 million, representing 3.16% year-over-year growth. The company’s EPS is expected to increase 253.13% year-over-year for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2021.

Of the eight analysts that rated the stock, four have rated it Buy. A $24.71 consensus price target represents a potential 81.6% gain from its last closing price of $13.61.""

""""From November 17, 2022 we will start production and deliveries of the Fisker Ocean SUV, with Denmark, Norway and Sweden among the first European markets to launch,"" commented Fisker Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Henrik Fisker. ""Supporting a great product must be an equally great ownership experience. Partnering with the recognized leader in service and logistics across Scandinavia will be an important part of delivering excellence to our customers.""

2021-06-06 11:04:33,wallstreetbets,What reputation? They tried once and failed because the battery went bankrupt. Most successful entrepreneurs and successful people failed at the beginning. If you learn from them failures are beneficial. Fisker has very solid partners and a good business plan now.

2021-06-06 11:30:00,wallstreetbets,"Cool, who are those partners? The Fisker Karma ended up having a fairly negative reputation. Since that is the only production car Fisker has ever actually brought to market, that is something that cannot be ignored. Additionally, the company went bankrupt previously. Last I saw they had a concept car in 2016 but in no way have demonstrated the capability to produce a mass market vehicle. That is why I ask who owns them. If they have the backing of a major organization with the industrial capacity to see this through, I would be more interested. If it's just Henrik Fisker and a fat stack of cash, I personally am not going to get involved."
2021-06-06 12:29:46,wallstreetbets,"Lincoln is a brand, not a company. Fisker is its own company."
2021-06-06 11:57:55,wallstreetbets,They are owned by Henrik Fisker. Mayor partners are Magna (builds cars for BMW and Toyota) and Foxconn  (apple supplier). Magna hold also 6% ownership I think. Magna will manufacture the Fiker ocean. Cars will be released next year. They have already more than 15k reservations. Foxconn will produce their second car in the USA. Location will be announced in the next 6 weeks.
2021-06-06 12:50:57,wallstreetbets,"Apologies, I remembered a Chinese company buying Fisker and thought they were going to be selling cars under the Fisker name. I just looked it up and they only purchased the cars, technology, and factory while Henrik Fisker kept the trademark and name.

2021-06-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. 

Overall, it has been an amazing week for investors in general and all the top growing stocks that [I shared here last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) have ended in green with an average return of 11.7%. So, without further ado, let's dive into this week’s list! 

 **Most Discussed Stocks of the Week** 

https://preview.redd.it/per8x892fn371.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d457b0954852cb8d3abacf10341d7dadd99e3d3

Both AMC and BB individually generated more discussion than the other 8 put together! This can be attributed to the possibility of the next squeeze and also the rallying stock price. Weed stocks also made a double entry into the top 10 list with SNDL coming in 4th and TLRY 5th (we will discuss why in the next section). Investors were most bullish about Tilray and Nokia’s prospects as reflected by the sentiment! Another interesting observation is that it has been a rough week for Tesla with it being the only stock in the list that ended in the red.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/ov3zes4cfn371.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca5d580ccfea58c5659a40b50afec8b78da53666

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Almost all the stocks increased in chatter due to the rally of meme stocks and not due to any fundamental news

**BlackBerry($BB):** No points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. BlackBerry was also present in the [last week’s list](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) and the stock has been running up almost 80% in the last six weeks. The discussions were predominantly driven around whether BB would be the next short squeeze play. Even though the company has made some significant strides over the last year (Collaboration with AWS being an example), there are no specific news that’s driving the current rally.

**Clean Energy Fuels($CLNE):** There isn’t any new fundamental news out of the company for the current rally but the discussion exploded in Reddit and the stock gained as much as 20% on Thursday. The stock experienced a quadrupling of the average daily volume as Reddit investors piled on to the stock. The company is still trading at a healthy 17.6% increase over last week’s closing price.

**Workhorse Group($WKHS):** Even though the company did not have a good month in May with them disappointing the investors with their first-quarter results (the company only delivered six electric cargo trucks). But the shares of the company have rocketed more than 40% in June. The discussion volume as well as the trading volume has been on a consistent rise over the past week.  

**Nokia($NOK):** Nokia’s current rally is primarily driven by optimism over its back-to-back 5G network deployment wins with multiple telecom operators such as Net4Mobility, DITO Telecommunity Corporation, T-Mobile, and Optus. The company has also resolved a long-drawn patent licensing dispute with Daimler and has been strengthening its financials by generating strong cash flows. Investor sentiment has also been extremely bullish as we can see from the trends.

**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** Weed stocks are mainly moving due to a mix of fundamental news and retail trading interest. SNDL rose almost 30% this week before dropping down. The marijuana industry is consolidating and a spate of deals were announced this week. Adding to this, there has been progress in legalization efforts in the US. Tilray(TLRY) has also been on the run with the stock price increasing 12% and the chatter growing by 300% this week.

**Honorable Mentions:** AMC Entertainment($AMC) chatter grew by 189% (which is massive considering that the stock was already the [most discussed stock last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/)) and Clover Health ($CLOV) discussions increased by 255% but were not high enough to make the top 5 list.

2021-06-06 13:04:31,wallstreetbets,$CLNE doesn't have new news but it does have an off the chain option interest for 6/18. It's also under what it's fair value should be and can be easily moved with volume.

2021-06-06 14:52:56,wallstreetbets,This sub alone has essentially banned/discouraged all mention of GME for months after the January fallout. So much so that GME holders have migrated to two different subs in the meantime.  While in the r gme or r $uper$tonk nobody is going to post the ticker.  Same with the Amcstonk sub.  I wonder if your tracker tracks activity in specific stock subs.  If I recall correctly $uper$stonk is the #3 most actively commented stock on Reddit as of last week.

2021-06-06 15:05:38,wallstreetbets,"Because i want to get profit ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face), so i join my Apes to invest small money in Meme's stonk and get money from the ride!

2021-06-06 13:38:49,wallstreetbets,Yea because I only believe in 1 thing
2021-06-06 17:33:21,wallstreetbets,Omg can't believe you  replied to me. You are a legend and inspiration! This is a SIGN!!
2021-06-06 18:52:44,wallstreetbets,I like your risk management Sir 👍
2021-06-06 13:52:26,wallstreetbets,My news post had a link in it to a news article.  And it's not just me.   Many people reported this issue on Friday
2021-06-06 10:45:01,wallstreetbets,Important question: Did you include rocket 🚀‘???
2021-06-06 16:03:26,wallstreetbets,I don't know. Probably still trying to get more push for BB and WKHS.
2021-06-06 17:59:51,wallstreetbets,Mods don't have positions in CLNE
2021-06-06 11:56:03,wallstreetbets,Why do they block CLOV posts?
2021-06-06 10:34:40,wallstreetbets,Mods will allow posts and buy in once we are squeezing!
2021-06-06 18:05:55,wallstreetbets,Thats simply not true. It’s market cap is 20% more than GME‘s market cap depending on the day.
2021-06-06 15:11:19,wallstreetbets,It becomes the majority.
2021-06-06 12:31:04,wallstreetbets,What does this have to do with the Stock price
2021-06-06 10:42:38,wallstreetbets,All 47000000 shorts!
2021-06-06 10:28:16,wallstreetbets,Ain't we all :p
2021-06-06 11:27:15,wallstreetbets,SEC issued a “short sale restriction” on WKHS for Monday. It’s gaining trading volume and mentions. It has the highest SI in the market. I’m bullish on AMC and that indirectly means I think heavy short stocks will gain traction as a result. My 2 cents.
2021-06-06 11:07:42,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-06-06 10:41:08,wallstreetbets,Honestly rolling AMC or GME winnings into something like CLOV or CLNE that have high SI and are UNDER their price targets (plus MUCH lower market caps) would not be a terrible move.

2021-06-06 18:50:09,wallstreetbets,eToro didn't have AMC before and I really like the GameStop stock and it looks like it has a great future. I did try BB and NOK for a hot minute but YOLOed in GME in the end lol.
2021-06-06 12:59:19,wallstreetbets,I can only read one post a year

2021-06-06 12:51:45,wallstreetbets,They don't actually sell anything. It's fundamentally a scam.
2021-06-06 11:34:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but CLOV is up to 41%, similar market cap, and isn't a scam. Oh, and it's under it's PT and being added to the Russell."
2021-06-06 13:28:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah and MSOS hasn’t been doing great as of late
2021-06-06 12:53:45,wallstreetbets,Why though?

2021-06-06 10:44:48,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. The ONLY case against CLOV vs basically everything else is volume which... 


If people really want to screw hedge funds CLOV is the play. Maybe CLNE. 


I am tired of hearing about Workhorse which is a literal scam."

2021-06-06 12:29:31,wallstreetbets,Nobody seems to want to make money on CLOV until somebody makes money on CLOV. In early with 600 shares and happy to see the slow but steady growth. Check out r/CLOV. Some honest discussion going on as we speak and some great DD. Should be a great week/month regardless of its mention here.
2021-06-06 11:40:27,wallstreetbets,Ditto and happy hunting. Be so easy if I had money for all of them.
2021-06-06 18:47:24,wallstreetbets,But mods probalby take only thousands...
2021-06-06 12:50:34,wallstreetbets,"Seems like it has more going for it????? I don’t know the GME research so I’m not gonna pretend like I do, but we all know AMC currently has a LOT going for it. I wish I had some specifics on why GME is better. Seems like they are both amazing plays so far this year."
2021-06-06 13:31:58,wallstreetbets,Honestly what does DFV have to do with anything
2021-06-06 13:23:14,wallstreetbets,Does it bring you joy?
2021-06-06 13:10:42,wallstreetbets,"I agree AMC does have a lot going for it and I hope it goes to 1m for all of its shareholders.

2021-06-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,TD Ameritrade has added AMC to the restricted securities list 
2021-06-06 08:35:02,wallstreetbets,"Before anyone gets their panties in a twist:

> The following securities have additional requirements in place, and some trading strategies have been limited to only allow clients to trade with their own capital on hand, not borrowed funds. You can continue to place buy and sell stock orders, as well as some option strategies.

They’re just restricted with regard to margin"
2021-06-06 10:56:31,wallstreetbets,"The guy who posted a $639k loss on a $40 naked short call? That’ll do it.

Edit: Thanks for pointing out that it was a girl. 11/10 it’s guys that are that dumb.

And thanks for the awards. The wholesome award definitely touched my heart."
2021-06-06 09:17:22,wallstreetbets,Honestly I see this as a self preservation move so TD doesn’t get left on the hook by overly ambitious margin bets
2021-06-06 10:03:32,wallstreetbets,Looks like most of us are going to have to pick up an extra dinner shift at Wendy's to fund our gambling addiction.
2021-06-06 13:42:35,wallstreetbets,You can still trade AMC but they when it come to trading AMC on margin that is a different story.
2021-06-06 09:00:37,wallstreetbets,"Merrill Edge added long time ago: AMC, MVIS, OCGN, GME. These stocks need 100% margin to trade."
2021-06-06 08:46:47,wallstreetbets,"We knew this was comin, that’s why ya don’t trade w margin👌"
2021-06-06 10:58:59,wallstreetbets,"Because they know most of you don’t understand what margin is for. Hint: it isn’t to invest double your cash into a stock. It’s really a day trading tool to close a position and re-enter a new position fast.Without having to wait 2 days for the original position to settle. I think they’re attempting to protect you and themselves, from reckless bets."
2021-06-06 13:47:08,wallstreetbets,"Read the article, it doesn’t restrict trading on AMC, it asks for extra ‘extra requirements on options trades on 6/11’."
2021-06-06 15:54:31,wallstreetbets,"i called my broker from TD ameritrade and he told how happy he was to see how many well informed apes have been going out of there way to understand everything regarding this restriction. complimented my smooth brain for understanding why i had margin maintainence after slapping the ask on margin the first time when it was in the $20s.  


Asked me if wanted to sell some shares to cover it - about 7k worth - i said im not fucking selling amc/gme to the moon gorilla gang!!!"
2021-06-06 13:14:49,wallstreetbets,"ITT: entitled margin whores who want a brokerage to give them unlimited credit whenever they want for whatever they want. 

Y’alls gambling addiction isn’t more important than all their other client’s money or their solvency.

Go to the fucking casino already."

2021-06-06 17:01:07,wallstreetbets,Yo if the AMC can squeeze to $2500 this week so I can quit my job that would just be lovely
2021-06-06 12:58:44,wallstreetbets,"I read this as:

So glad I have Fidelity tbh."
2021-06-06 17:10:50,wallstreetbets,"You can’t blame them for limiting buys using margin accounts.  Still available if you use your cash. While I might buy AMC with my money, I wouldn’t loan my best friend money to buy it. All about managing risk."
2021-06-06 08:36:27,wallstreetbets,"That's why I like questrade, their stance is basically ""do what you want retard"" 😎"
2021-06-06 11:17:34,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀 AMC     🚀🚀
2021-06-06 15:12:47,wallstreetbets,Nothing makes a stock hotter than when it's a bad boy
2021-06-06 12:00:35,wallstreetbets,Well this title is kind of misleading.
2021-06-06 18:06:21,wallstreetbets,What does this mean exactly? Can someone dumb it down for a retard?
2021-06-06 10:28:01,wallstreetbets,"Additionally, TD would not allow buying zero day options on AMC so there’s that"
2021-06-06 11:25:03,wallstreetbets,"To clarify, you mean Schwab, who owns them. If Schwab makes a move, TD will emulate until the integration is complete."
2021-06-06 10:37:45,wallstreetbets,Protecting themselves from additional short selling because they see the writing on the walls.  Just a matter of time before AMC 🚀🌕
2021-06-06 11:30:00,wallstreetbets,Is this only for GME or is AMC in that too?
2021-06-06 12:02:32,wallstreetbets,"Their restrictions are actually fine though.

It's not like Robinhood when they banned all buying of it.  TD just won't offer you margin to make your retarded plays."
2021-06-06 12:09:46,wallstreetbets,"Love seeing AMC welcome back in WSB!  Love this sub, love the stock!"
2021-06-06 13:07:14,wallstreetbets,Because they’re a responsible brokerage.
2021-06-06 13:15:12,wallstreetbets,And gme
2021-06-06 15:14:46,wallstreetbets,People are mis reading this article. Basically you can still trade AMC as long as you have settle cash on your account.
2021-06-06 16:03:31,wallstreetbets,"Weird they mention no shorts on GME, but they've blocked shorting AMC for months"
2021-06-06 16:10:51,wallstreetbets,"But there are people using that platform who will swear up and down that Robinhood is bad for what they did. Maybe, this isn't a problem on Robinhood or even TD Ameritrade for that matter. But rather a problem with a broken financial system that quite literally allows institutions to manipulate markets. 

Naked shorting forces exchanges to cover their shit as well. As they are forced to ensure they remain liquid through these crazy price actions. This isn't Robinhood or TD's fault, it's the idiot institutions that think they can do shit like this without it affecting the market. 

Also, because of the nature of these exchanges/institutions and their scale, there's no getting away from them. If you left Robinhood for TD, you're still being affected by Robinhood's decisions in the Macro side of the market, regardless of who you do business with. Yes, cool you can exit your position. But in an economy where holding is being rewarded, why are you selling in the first place?"
2021-06-06 16:46:15,wallstreetbets,"Long term what effect will this have on the stock?

As a side note, I think banks are trying to cover their asses when they potentially get dragged back into court. They won’t accountable for the last few years of allowing their brokers to engage in naked selling, because they “put measures in place” to protect investors. 

They only now are doing this because they’re getting caught"
2021-06-06 16:53:45,wallstreetbets,I wish I had never signed up for TD Ameritrade. The only reason I did it was because they were the first exchange I found that carried the penny stocks I was interested in. I plan to bail as soon as possible. Because their fees and restrictions are just too much for me to deal with.
2021-06-06 16:56:48,wallstreetbets,The same thing that happened last time will happen again. Give it until Wednesday and DTCC will start asking the clearing houses for more collateral again
2021-06-06 17:12:02,wallstreetbets,How does your risk department let someone with jack shit risk infinite losses?
2021-06-06 18:40:53,wallstreetbets,"""You can continue to place buy and sell stock orders, as well as some option strategies""  , they are restricting shorts only, nobody panic"
2021-06-06 19:47:44,wallstreetbets,Title is misleading
2021-06-06 14:28:12,wallstreetbets,"All Reddit, please hold AMC 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-06 11:54:26,wallstreetbets,"There’s no big conspiracy going on here, the same shit happened with GME. You wanna know why it’s restricted? You retards keep trading with fucking unsettled funds. Stop selling so damn fast."
2021-06-06 13:49:12,wallstreetbets,"Oh look more FUD, you can trade AMC all you want, just don’t use margin."
2021-06-06 10:56:29,wallstreetbets,I'm scared. Should I buy more? Yes? Ok!
2021-06-06 10:16:29,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is i should buy more?
2021-06-06 11:13:09,wallstreetbets,IT’S FOR MARGIN ACCOUNTS ONLY!
2021-06-06 11:14:45,wallstreetbets,"Not the first time, and won't be the last time.!"
2021-06-06 13:17:26,wallstreetbets,This is good... so we are gonna fly this week!!
2021-06-06 10:57:12,wallstreetbets,"What if I’ve already bought shares with margin, does this affect me too? Any thoughts?"
2021-06-06 11:34:04,wallstreetbets,It is really telling that restricted lists with increased margin requirements are new to people interested in these securities.  Anyone using margin and trading in volatile securities would know about this within their first 6 months of trad… oh I see now. Too bad it’s not a conspiracy those are so much more fun amiright?
2021-06-06 11:42:14,wallstreetbets,If it's the same restrictions as GME you'll have to call TD each time you want to write a call. Kind of annoying but they're pretty quick and nice.
2021-06-06 11:47:46,wallstreetbets,Love how you say amc but look at the restriction list against it vs gme..  ones not the play they both are they move together
2021-06-06 11:49:17,wallstreetbets,Wish I had bought enough shares those weekly covered calls though 🤑

2021-06-06 12:37:11,wallstreetbets,"Anybody want to comment on how this is bullish for an anticipation of high volatility? 

- higher margin requirements to buy = your broker will definitely be able to settle your trade through the clearing house
- elimination of shorting = no attacks on low volume time blocks"

2021-06-06 13:27:30,wallstreetbets,This shit again?.... fucking Christ
2021-06-06 13:45:01,wallstreetbets,It's almost as if there are too many fools trading in it or something.
2021-06-06 14:35:49,wallstreetbets,What does this mean for AMC stock
2021-06-06 14:38:05,wallstreetbets,"Okay so only folks on wall street and the big players can do this. Got it, I’ll stick to my ramen."
2021-06-06 14:38:15,wallstreetbets,Lol I never had a problem with fidelity

2021-06-06 15:45:45,wallstreetbets,"From January on everyone is talking about that shorts have to cover etc., from time to time some deadlines were posted. 
Obviously they are still on their short positions.

From my understanding a short squeeze can only work if they are at some point all forced to cover, otherwise, why shouldn‘t they just wait for the price to drop again?

Please ELI5 cuz ape brain"

2021-06-06 17:01:28,wallstreetbets,What does this mean??? We can’t buy any AMC on RDX ameritrade?
2021-06-06 17:03:17,wallstreetbets,Restricted to cash trades only my understanding…. No margin….
2021-06-06 17:10:04,wallstreetbets,I think I understand just restricted for margin accounts?
2021-06-06 17:10:17,wallstreetbets,Well restricted to just our money not margin. I got 160 there and when bought more got margin called now I know why. Sold other positions so margin was at 0 and then I could buy on margin again just not amc or gme
2021-06-06 17:37:47,wallstreetbets,I am still able to buy on margin
2021-06-06 17:56:04,wallstreetbets,Indubitably

2021-06-06 11:49:45,wallstreetbets,"Lot of crazy misinformation in this thread, one way or another. Some are saying confidently that this means we're about to gap up big.

2021-06-06 13:15:10,wallstreetbets,To me this just screams oh shit we are fucked AMC is going to moon and we cant stop it so we need to plug as many holes as we can.

2021-06-06 13:50:03,wallstreetbets,Time to go all in on BB until it gets restricted
2021-06-06 15:07:26,wallstreetbets,AMC 500k floor
2021-06-06 10:49:12,wallstreetbets,Falling share price plus downside margin squeeze will increase the speed of the fall. AMC will fall back to $10.
2021-06-06 11:08:15,wallstreetbets,15000 shares.. and after mooon fuk TD
2021-06-06 10:43:55,wallstreetbets,Not true. I also have TD. No issues as of now
2021-06-06 12:44:36,wallstreetbets,If you cant win the game...change the rules.

2021-06-06 12:41:14,wallstreetbets,20 EOD Monday
2021-06-06 08:51:57,wallstreetbets,"they are getting scared of us apes, that's all. what did you expect?"
2021-06-06 11:03:53,wallstreetbets,I take this a a huge bullish sign especially if other exchanges are doing it too. For me this reads that they have all been talking and have come to the realization that they are either close or in the same territory as GME with possibly selling more shares than the available float. To me this says that they are worried about having shares available if the HF’s get margin called
2021-06-06 11:36:33,wallstreetbets,Something is about to go DOWN. And it ain’t GME.
2021-06-06 08:41:51,wallstreetbets,"I'm leaving td ameritrade, garbage platform. Margin rate is ridiculous and they always go down when I'm in desperate need to make a play."
2021-06-06 08:41:33,wallstreetbets,So we have had our fun with GME and AMC. BB next?
2021-06-06 14:08:46,wallstreetbets,"expected..

I have sold all my AMC last week.."
2021-06-06 10:33:42,wallstreetbets,So Shitadel need to start spunking their own money up the wall
2021-06-06 16:35:29,wallstreetbets,Good AMC is way over valued! You fools are propping up a false god. HBO Max has the right idea in streaming already new movies for just the subscription fee. Others WILL follow and AMC will burn along with your profits.
2021-06-06 11:07:24,wallstreetbets,"So It can’t be shorted with borrowed shares. We buy, it flys!"
2021-06-06 10:41:47,wallstreetbets,Schwab has not allowed margin buys of gme or amc in months. Cash on hand only. 400 percent of day trading power whatever that means.
2021-06-06 10:54:27,wallstreetbets,This is old news
2021-06-06 11:36:14,wallstreetbets,"Guess everyone gangsta,
Until margin calls you.
So no more borrowing!"
2021-06-06 11:36:32,wallstreetbets,Completely unexpected.
2021-06-06 11:37:08,wallstreetbets,"I'm Canadian and have used TD webbroker for years and they change allowable margins for individual stocks a lot
They are probably just lowering the margin amount for AMC as part of TD 's due diligence to protect themselves
It has happened to me in the past a few times sometimes the other way gave me more margin on a few holdings of mine
Not sure about TD Ameritrade though but I bet it's very similar"
2021-06-06 11:40:16,wallstreetbets,It's been on that list for a while now I think it was placed tehri end of FEB beginning of march when it got listed as HTB(Hard to Borrow)
2021-06-06 11:40:24,wallstreetbets,It's been that way since January but 👌
2021-06-06 11:42:27,wallstreetbets,I stopped using TD Canada Trust for trading. They were far too expensive and I'm kind of glad I did if they're doing something like this. Now I use Questrade and even though I have a Margin account I don't really borrow on Margin.
2021-06-06 11:43:26,wallstreetbets,You might have to ask your wife's boyfriends girlfriend on how to do that.
2021-06-06 11:44:55,wallstreetbets,Because of course they did.

2021-06-06 11:58:42,wallstreetbets,Yea i tried to buy some 0dte calls on Friday. In this case they saved me money but when this flys going to be pissed
2021-06-06 12:01:08,wallstreetbets,"Looks as though I cannot sell a covered call on AMC or GME unless I call them. Once again, time to move to Tasty Works who will let me do whatever the hell I want. They will still make the margin requirement 100%, which is totally understandable, but at least they will let me do it without having to ask ""mother may I""."
2021-06-06 12:01:43,wallstreetbets,Haha they didn't like my naked calls
2021-06-06 12:03:01,wallstreetbets,Good. They are only putting restrictions on margins.
2021-06-06 12:08:02,wallstreetbets,I think the title is misleading!! It’s both AMC and GME
2021-06-06 12:09:43,wallstreetbets,So what you’re saying is move to Webull?
2021-06-06 12:12:02,wallstreetbets,Smell like a gamma squeeze on its way

2021-06-06 13:07:35,wallstreetbets,"The way I read that page, you still have to actually call them to place a buy write order. So presumably, I will not be able to roll my covered call which I already have, without calling them."

2021-06-06 13:13:01,wallstreetbets,ootoo

2021-06-06 13:35:28,wallstreetbets,Great reason to just keep buying anywhere else.
2021-06-06 13:37:06,wallstreetbets,I never buy calls expiring in less than a year for this reason
2021-06-06 13:42:31,wallstreetbets,im not buying my 1 share of amc till its 100$ i only need one if it goes to 100k. and if zero wtf 100$

2021-06-06 13:52:42,wallstreetbets,It also says short selling not allowed for GME. Isn’t that bad for hedge funds who were trying to short it?
2021-06-06 13:55:46,wallstreetbets,Notice BB is not on this list. Yall know what to do
2021-06-06 13:59:03,wallstreetbets,I see it says AMC but it doesnt use the  word short sales only on GME  ?? What does that mean for a smooth brain Ape??
2021-06-06 14:03:30,wallstreetbets,Someone call Negan.… Oops wrong AMC
2021-06-06 14:10:24,wallstreetbets,"> If you currently own stock in one of these securities and wish to sell a covered call, you must do so with a broker. Please be aware that wait times to speak with a broker may be longer than normal due to current market conditions.

I'm not clear on the wording of this, under GME.  Is this saying that *anyone* currently owning this stock can only sell it now over the phone?  Or is there something about the phrase ""and wish to sell a covered call"" that I don't understand?

Because if it's the former, I can see how they could use this to protect the hedge funds and royally fuck their retail customers.  All they'd have to do is slow down how quickly they answer the phones until the stock is on its way back down."

2021-06-06 08:41:57,wallstreetbets,Reading is hard :(
2021-06-06 11:29:27,wallstreetbets,Not only margin. You can’t even sell covered calls. What the fuck.
2021-06-06 10:52:31,wallstreetbets,"There are tons of stocks with increased or restricted margin requirements. So ya, this is SOP for brokers."
2021-06-06 10:37:03,wallstreetbets,Not true. I trade options with my own capita. Was only allowed to sell to close
2021-06-06 11:18:47,wallstreetbets,That's not all. They restrict the price of sell orders. They wouldn't let me just set a sell order for 170. 169 was the highest that wouldn't get rejected.
2021-06-06 11:53:27,wallstreetbets,This is what Merrill Edge did too it’s not a big deal for certain stocks to not be available by margin. Try buying Berkshire Hathaway class A on margin.
2021-06-06 10:58:20,wallstreetbets,What if I like my panties getting in a bunch
2021-06-06 08:50:48,wallstreetbets,“As well as some option strategies”. I have a TD cash account and couldn’t buy any expiring options Friday for a YOLO bet. It’s my option and I want it now!
2021-06-06 11:12:13,wallstreetbets,"(Slowly puts pitchfork down.)

Motherfuckers best not mess with my AMC."
2021-06-06 10:21:31,wallstreetbets,They said something about calling broker to sell covered calls. Ape confused 😞
2021-06-06 10:45:52,wallstreetbets,This means it’s starting 🚀
2021-06-06 12:08:42,wallstreetbets,They also restricted short selling. You missed that part.
2021-06-06 09:09:04,wallstreetbets,"I doubt very much that these restrictions apply to the hedge funds and short sellers.  Without a doubt discriminatory rules, no way they’ll stay in business if the restrict their largest clients."
2021-06-06 10:57:00,wallstreetbets,"Couldn’t open new FDs on Friday, only closing transactions"
2021-06-06 10:57:54,wallstreetbets,Do You mean no margin trading?
2021-06-06 11:10:20,wallstreetbets,How can anyone be upset by this. They're trying to protect dumbasses from their own stupidity.
2021-06-06 11:31:38,wallstreetbets,The Anti-Yolo policy.
2021-06-06 11:59:11,wallstreetbets,Smart move.
2021-06-06 12:10:22,wallstreetbets,"I read around that they Security has placed #sundial in the list among AMC!
Now no more borrow if you buy Sundial stock too."
2021-06-06 12:40:54,wallstreetbets,"Heck, I think my broker never removed margin restrictions since January..."
2021-06-06 12:48:22,wallstreetbets,"GME - NO SHORTING lol fuck yeah! ( READ THE LINK )
GME is gonna 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-06 12:49:21,wallstreetbets,But are we really free if we can't gamble on meme stocks with money we don't have?
2021-06-06 12:51:04,wallstreetbets,"Additionally, the broker-dealers have requirements that vary based on the individual.  So if you’re ultra concentrated, you’re likely to have an increased margin requirement."
2021-06-06 12:51:25,wallstreetbets,Did the exact same thing with other volatile stocks in the past. It's normal procedure.
2021-06-06 14:20:31,wallstreetbets,They are also restricting shorting.
2021-06-06 15:41:27,wallstreetbets,"Imagine that, margin and leverage increase counterparty risk. I'm actually surprised that they did it - risk-on has been the name of the game since the post financial crisis bull market began."
2021-06-06 17:19:37,wallstreetbets,"Why did I read this as ""restricted with retard to margin"""
2021-06-06 17:26:58,wallstreetbets,If only that applied to everyone.
2021-06-06 17:28:42,wallstreetbets,"How can you short a stock without margin if technically the balance you need to hold is theoretically infinite? 

Does this mean they are restricting shorts?"
2021-06-06 17:39:43,wallstreetbets,Ape eager to lynch. Me pitchfork & poop ready at side.
2021-06-06 18:07:11,wallstreetbets,They're also potentially restricting weeklies again to minimize a gamma squeeze
2021-06-06 18:45:03,wallstreetbets,Also you have to call a broker to sell covered options for gme.  Good luck if you can’t excercuse Friday.
2021-06-06 19:11:15,wallstreetbets,"if i'm understanding this correctly, this is the same as what robinhood did? but robinhood didn't let people know all the accounts were margin accounts?"

2021-06-06 12:28:25,wallstreetbets,They restricted my ability to buy call options on days of expiration. It’s my fucking money let me do what I want with it fuck them

2021-06-06 12:13:00,wallstreetbets,"Just think. That chick thinks she didn't get greedy. She's still blaming other people for her loss and pretending it's not her fault, and that nobody knows how options work. Mind blowing"

He sold 250k worths of naked calls at something like a 50 strike a few months out when GME was 20. I wonder what his balance was around january peak"

2021-06-06 17:06:31,wallstreetbets,WTF

2021-06-06 19:23:53,wallstreetbets,"> $639k loss on a $40

Surely you mean 40k.  No way AMC's stock went up in prices by a factor of thousands."
2021-06-06 19:32:24,wallstreetbets,How much did he put in?
2021-06-06 19:46:18,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain what this means and how that happened?
2021-06-06 11:22:50,wallstreetbets,Exactly. People forget what happens when someone fails margin call. i.e broker is out of pocket.
2021-06-06 12:15:26,wallstreetbets,Obviously.
2021-06-06 17:51:37,wallstreetbets,I mean isn't that what also happened with Robinhood and GME that everybody has decided to permanently hate robinhood for?
2021-06-06 10:38:05,wallstreetbets,I bought more shares instead of making a credit card payment. Lol
2021-06-06 12:58:24,wallstreetbets,"Damn, the tendie cheat code."
2021-06-06 10:52:56,wallstreetbets,"It can go higher than that, I think some brokers do up to 300% on short stock positions"

2021-06-06 11:51:03,wallstreetbets,OCGN? Really? I was planning on writing covered calls on them but seeing it lumped in with these retard stocks has me second guessing.
2021-06-06 13:24:59,wallstreetbets,OCGN covered call has very good premium
2021-06-06 11:23:06,wallstreetbets,Who do I get the feeling these rules are only for apes.
2021-06-06 11:19:52,wallstreetbets,"Interactive brokers already had it at 100% margin requirement last week. Actually pretty much any meme stock discussed on WSB seems to be on their list, 100% initial margin req. long, 300% for short. They must have started to scan social media, wasn't like that at the beginning of the year."

Not a surprise, folks. Just a mile marker to Moontown."

2021-06-06 10:20:54,wallstreetbets,I had someone tell me they used their whole margin to buy stocks with to do covered calls thinking this MF genius figured out a way to get basically free 15% a year off the dividend covered call combo. I asked him how much he had to pay to be using that margin it wasn’t too long until he ditched the shares he bought on margin.
2021-06-06 11:38:35,wallstreetbets,Exactly. If you’re gonna fuck around with margin anyways just use options instead
2021-06-06 16:01:08,wallstreetbets,Fuck ya bro. Thanks to this forum I got all my shit off margin IN FEB 21. thank you to all the contributors (fuckin retards) on this forum who look out for each others well being
2021-06-06 11:52:32,wallstreetbets,"If you have a long view on sp500, 2x voo thru margin will yield a better result than buying one of the 2x etfs.  There are plenty of reasons to maintain positions on margins."
2021-06-06 13:08:38,wallstreetbets,"Yep. You use options, not margin if you want to increase the beta of your position. Look at the 2x and 3x sp500 etfs. They use options, not margin, to function. 

Of course, the math is hard, so I understand why retail investors just use margin."
2021-06-06 12:18:30,wallstreetbets,Nobody here is doing reckless bets 🥺

2021-06-06 10:51:37,wallstreetbets,"Gme restricted first on other plattforms.

Both will squeeze when DTCC 005 comes in place.

Gme will squeeze much more its my opinion because of mr.burry ryan cohan and dfv.

But i just wanna say DTCC 005 will be the killshot 100%.

But lets look forward to the Share Holder meeting.

Lets goo"

2021-06-06 10:18:51,wallstreetbets,I lost money because of this cause I couldn’t call during business hours. Now they do it again.

2021-06-06 10:02:39,wallstreetbets,Thanks for being honest.
2021-06-06 11:46:48,wallstreetbets,you can still do PMCC
2021-06-06 13:38:21,wallstreetbets,Not in my experience
2021-06-06 13:09:02,wallstreetbets,Found the addict.
2021-06-06 11:20:49,wallstreetbets,they’re fucking retarded then
2021-06-06 10:53:48,wallstreetbets,If your broker doesn’t change the margin requirements for highly volatile stocks then they are the retards.
2021-06-06 11:46:27,wallstreetbets,"thats not how margin works, someone has to foot the bill.  they should be allowed to regulate their margin, it is literally their money"
2021-06-06 10:21:44,wallstreetbets,Ya buy you need to sign that sheet that says you want to trade options. After that it’s like yolo
2021-06-06 09:44:33,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha I’m dead
2021-06-06 08:54:14,wallstreetbets,LMAO 🤣
2021-06-06 09:31:04,wallstreetbets,Hahaha so true

2021-06-06 10:59:45,wallstreetbets,"It is but if you have shares on margin they can technically lend them out to other buyers so you have to be careful especially with these ones. If your shares get lent out mid squeeze you might get in trouble. I would just be very cautious with buying these ones on margin especially with Questrade. 

I know this cause I spoke directly to them last week about this exact thing"
2021-06-06 12:36:38,wallstreetbets,I think they’re the retards since your doing it with their money on loan.
2021-06-06 11:35:36,wallstreetbets,"Yes they did, I did it on Friday

They did not allow me to sell to open covered calls without calling in or love chatting to push it through. But they still allowed it 

I’m a cash account."
2021-06-06 11:33:19,wallstreetbets,Yes it is
2021-06-06 16:16:56,wallstreetbets,this is literally just saying if you wanna trade anything with amc you need a lot more margin than before. Isn’t restricting buying or selling with your own cash.
2021-06-06 11:30:50,wallstreetbets,"Not it’s for all accounts tried to sell to open covered calls Friday and they wouldn’t let me…I had to call in and push the order in. 

However I was able to STO CC for the next week and that went through the system no need to call/chat it through


I have a cash account"
2021-06-06 11:02:14,wallstreetbets,"Ya. You can lose your shares at any time cause it isn't yours.

Look what happened Jan with Robinhood for those who bought at margin. Many lost their shares."
2021-06-06 16:17:56,wallstreetbets,they are only making margin restrictions higher. They are the ones lending the money so they can do what they want.
2021-06-06 12:08:56,wallstreetbets,They do.  You just have to call in and have 100% cash to cover your position.
2021-06-06 12:48:33,wallstreetbets,"Eh, I do not want retailers to risk making my broker lose money. I would much rather them make it harder to make extremely risky plays than introduce expensive fees to compensate for loss on stupid plays."
2021-06-06 11:26:22,wallstreetbets,Basically they are just saying “Use your own bananas not our bananas”
2021-06-06 11:07:39,wallstreetbets,"You can't borrow their money to buy said stocks anymore.  Bearish signal, they anticipate a lot of losses and don't want to incur the risk on their client's (you) behalf, you have to play with your own money.  Same thing happened right before the crash in January."
2021-06-06 11:09:35,wallstreetbets,Bump
2021-06-06 11:37:00,wallstreetbets,They do allow it you just need to live chat or phone the order in.
2021-06-06 11:43:51,wallstreetbets,It's alright.

2021-06-06 11:41:51,wallstreetbets,"Yep,  when gme was popping the first time I used 1k with robinhood gold that I didn't have to buy otm calls. If I didn't make 10k overnight then that 1k would have gone to collections. Lolol"

2021-06-06 16:30:13,wallstreetbets,Is this why brokerage companies have restricted securities lists in the first place? I haven’t heard of companies like TD locking out trades until the AMC GME fiasco.

2021-06-06 09:56:28,wallstreetbets,Aping is harder.
2021-06-06 15:32:36,wallstreetbets,You have to talk to the trade desk to place options trades even if you have the cash in place to cover selling puts. For some reason their system doesn’t detect cash balance so it can’t tell whether it’s naked or covered. I’ve been having to sell puts on GME like this for weeks. You can also get them to waive the trade desk fee since they’re forcing you to place trades this way.
2021-06-06 11:27:52,wallstreetbets,Oh no
2021-06-06 09:41:37,wallstreetbets,Do you have enough to cover it if it gets assigned?
2021-06-06 12:28:38,wallstreetbets,"TD does not allow you to open positions on expiry. They--or more specifically at this time their custodial interest--also has this irritating habit of deciding when you should be allowed to enter or exit a position, which shocker doesn't align at all with my best practices for taking profit."

2021-06-06 10:34:08,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean ""still"" positive? It was negative news to begin with, this just makes it marginally less negative. This really only affects buying, not selling. You can't really sell on margin, at least not on the level of most new retail traders. If you want AMC's price to go up and the buying side is having restrictions placed on it and the selling side isn't, then no, that's not positive news."

2021-06-06 14:47:58,wallstreetbets,"They sold contracts to someone and made a little money hoping the stock wouldn't go up. The stock went up and the contract got exercised, so the seller had to buy shares at the current price and sell them to the buyer at the price in the contract, generating loss.

If the contract seller had bought the shares before, they could just hand those over and the loss would be limited. It's naked because they didn't own the shares before."
2021-06-06 19:14:05,wallstreetbets,"A covered call is when you own shares and promise (via a contract) to sell them at a future date for some price above what it is now. So you hope the price stays below that key price (the strike price), so that you keep your shares and keep the commission you made selling that contract. (Because the person you made the deal with doesn't have to make you sell, they merely are allowed to if they want. And they won't force you to sell at $40 for example if the stock is below that since they can just by it lower at the market price.) In that instance, your shares are actually locked up by the broker as collateral, so you can't reneg on your promise.

E.g. I promise to sell you 100 shares of AMC next week at $40 per share if you want, and I charge you $2 for giving you that option to force me to sell. If the price is below $40 next week, I keep the $2 and am happy, and you don't force me to sell since you can just buy shares for less than $40 on the open market. If OTOH the price is $45 next week, I have to sell them to you for $40, and you are happy because you can immediately turn around and sell them for $45. And during this next week while we wait to see what the price is, my shares are locked up.)

A naked call is the same thing but I don't actually have the shares and I just pinky swear to the broker that I'll buy them at the market price if and when the time comes. This is what OP did and it is dangerous because the price could go infinitely high and since he doesn't have the shares, he has to pay whatever the market price is to buy them, so that he can then fulfil his obligation to sell them at that lower price. This is what happened, and OP suffered a catastrophic loss."
2021-06-06 12:08:49,wallstreetbets,Correct. A short call is sold. A long call is purchased.
2021-06-06 12:21:44,wallstreetbets,Naked calls on meme stocks = getting skinned alive.
2021-06-06 19:40:44,wallstreetbets,"If you sell 500 contracts, and each controls 100 shares, that’s controlling 50,000 shares. If each contract is underwater by $15 per share and options are hella expensive, that gets you to $750k or likely much, much more. $750k minus premium received could be $650 easily.

Basically, don’t sell calls unless you own an equivalent number of shares. Just don’t."
2021-06-06 19:51:24,wallstreetbets,"500 options contracts = 50,000 shares. If AMC is at $55, you’re in the hole $750k on a $40 strike just on the shares. Add theta, Vega, and subtract premium. That’s easily $640k."
2021-06-06 12:44:16,wallstreetbets,This. Risk management is very important.

2021-06-06 18:14:12,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood has restricted the buying of stock *period* even if you have the cash for the purchase already in your account.

2021-06-06 14:57:10,wallstreetbets,IBKR is known for their risk controls and margin pricing vs other brokers (although all big ones aside from Robinhood have a good track record for risk mgmt). Definitely have algos monitoring this type of stuff because margin rates are extremely competitive and as a result they’ve gained share of the overall margin balance pool in the US in recent years. Margin is exploding for all the public brokers though this year

2021-06-06 12:20:39,wallstreetbets,"I've often wondered how wise it would be to margin up at 2x on spy and just leave it like that as long as rates are low. If I'm charged 2.5% for margin, over time spy should murder that"
2021-06-06 13:44:36,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't that depend entirely on the size of your account and how the s&p performs that year? The interest rates on small accounts are pretty chunky. Like if the S&P stayed flat for a year you'd lose ~5% of your cash using the margin strategy compared to a leveraged ETF. You'd also have to be constantly selling to stay at the same level of margin.

2021-06-06 15:25:13,wallstreetbets,"Ya, this is a bit of a click bait title.

5. Huge share dilution through capital raising
6. Cash flow negative

""Apes"" are exposing a problem of naked shorting (share counterfeiting) that's has a history of litigation and documented SEC fines. This is a research backed, evidence based, quantifiable theory about illegal practices in our markets that should be stopped. Banning short selling or limiting trading on the companies that have been theorized to be the victims of these predatory practices doesn't prove any of this, but it does lend credence that there is more to this story.

No such thing as non-naked shorting, that’s a distinction dreamt up to justify what should be criminal, all shorting, whether it’s selling fake stock or borrowed stock. Even the most experienced dealers and brokers, even the SEC, knows that all shorting borrowed leads to shorting for which their is no real stocks, only fake stocks. If not for this, there would be no hyperbolic squeezes, no need for bail outs, no need for printing more shares like AMC did.  There are no effective controls, their greed takes them to the extremes every time, the shorting needs to be outlawed. People who dream up words like “synthetic” stock need to be shot.

2021-06-06 13:04:01,wallstreetbets,consider something like $STWD.  it prints a 7.5% dividend.  its been historically ultra stable.  and the dividend makes the math ultra simple.
2021-06-06 14:12:38,wallstreetbets,"If you could afford the interest on the loan, $100k in SPY at 2.5% on 7/1/2016 would have profited you $89432 cashed out 6/1/2021 and would have been profitable cashing out at the end of any month in the last five years.  Even cashing out on April first of 2020 would have left you a profit of $9000.

Issue is that that loan for the shares would run you $208.33 a month, adding up to 12.5k in costs before cashing out.

Now if you did the same thing at the beginning of 2020 before the pandemic crash, you’d have been paying to lose money until July, gone into the black for two months, gone back to the red again for November and then made gains since.

While 2020 was a very bad year, there ultimately is little predictability to when bad years happen.  And as I mentioned with regard to April of 2020 above, a few very bad months can nearly wipe out all your gains from years in this kind of scheme.

Also, 2.5% is an excellent rate for margin. The best Fidelity will give is 4% if you have a million in balance, and Charles Schwab won’t go below 6.575% (at 250k in balance), though you might be able to negotiate a better rate if you have more balance.

With smaller balances, their rate can go as high as 8.325%, which would make this play much riskier. On the 5 year example, the end of month would have been in the red on three occasions (Nov 2016, Jan 2019, and Apr 2020). On the “New Years 2020” start, you’d have been negative all but one month of 2020. In both examples you’d make more money today than you’d have spent in interest (generally doubling your interest payment), but we’re in one hell of a bull market.

So ultimately this I wise if your rate is low and you aren’t buying before a crash. As for me, I wouldn’t do it now. The “recovery” bull market right now feels really bubbly to me right now for a variety of factors."

2021-06-06 13:57:33,wallstreetbets,"there's no free lunch.  if the market drops, you lose 2x plus interest.  if it goes up, you win 2x plus interest.  same with longing a 2x etf.  and of course, margin rate is highly dependent on account size.   I think, with negotiation, you can knock it down to  2% if you're doing 100k+ on many vendors, so it is not an impossible tranche."

2021-06-06 11:18:21,wallstreetbets,"Something seems wrong. If you have 1k in your bank and you deposit a 3k check, you can still only withdraw 1k until the check clears. No bank is going to let you withdraw funds from a check immediately.

Well, there is one exception I know of. If you take the check to the bank that owns the account, they can verify the funds and give you money immediately. But that requires going to the check writers bank, not your bank or an atm.

EDIT: I may be wrong. Several people replied and said that banks have changed their ways now and will actually allow some limited withdrawals on checks before they clear."

The only time to think about doing it is when the stock is about to cross a major resistance point like when GME pushed past $200 recently, or when it went past $50 a few months ago, or when AMC broke past $15 and set this whole move up. If it's not a perfect set up with the intraday chart lining up with the longer term daily and even monthly chart, it's just not worth the risk.

2021-06-06 14:36:51,wallstreetbets,"Can you break down the math on that a little more? Leveraged ETF expense ratios are usually way less than that, and 2% margin rates seem super low (TD's lowest is currently 7.5% on $250,000 accounts, which is below the base rate). I'm struggling to think of where the benefit is in either direction. Even if you got down to 2%, your expense ratio across your whole account would still be higher than an average 2x ETF. I'm just confused about where the Benefit fits in unless you could get an interest rate < 2 times the ETFs expense ratio."
2021-06-06 11:46:19,wallstreetbets,And how will that work in practise? Will there be markets for borrowed shares and unborrowed ones? Because unborrowed ones would then be worth more.

2021-06-06 17:29:28,wallstreetbets,Believe or not the brokers are restricting these high risk trading to protect their clients and themselves. The brokers long term business health is dependent on their clients ability to make a return on their investment.
2021-06-06 11:00:21,wallstreetbets,"The sad reality is, the systems involved are so convoluted, barely monitored, and ripe with errors that if you timed everything correctly, could convince them that the check wasn’t fraudulent only “bad” which you could do by registering a shell company which would issue the check, that if you did it and profited enough to off the bad check amount and a fee, you’d likely get away with it.

It's actually a law in Canada that [financial institutions must make the first $100 of all funds you deposit by a cheque available to you right away.](https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/banking/cashing-cheques.html#:~:text=Financial%20institutions%20must%20make%20the%20first%20%24100%20of%20all%20funds%20you%20deposit%20by%20a%20cheque%20available%20to%20you%20right%20away.)"
2021-06-06 12:57:02,wallstreetbets,"depends on your relationship with the bank. Also may depend on your country/state/provincial regulations. 

I can go to my bank, put in a cheque right now, with nothing in my account, and they will let me take out up to 1000 against that cheque immediately. I can't take anything else out until that cheque clears. I have also been with this bank for 37 years. 

But this is also why now many banks ATM's have gotten rid of envelopes when depositing cash and cheques. You can't put in an empty envelope anymore. This has been about 6 or 7 years here. Some of the smaller banks and credit unions don't have all of their machines set up for this yet. Usually the major cities/bigger towns have them, smaller ones don't."

The entire system is broken and creates a huge opportunity to do some fucked up things. 

For example if you're a large minority shareholder you might be tempted to place massive short sale on your own stock to drive the price down and try to take majority position. 

Another epic example of attempted market manipulation gone wrong is Melvin Capital and others placing a massive short sale and then telling their friends at Citron Research to crank up the bearish sentiment to drive the price down. That backfires spectacularly but it begs the question, how many times did they do this successfully before?"

They sell covered calls on meme stocks, but sometimes the underlying stock rises past the strike price on their calls. When this happens, they buy the call back at a loss, then sell another at a higher strike and later date. They keep doing this as necessary until they close the trade when they think they've maximized their potential profit.""

2021-06-06 15:34:58,wallstreetbets,"For those following meme stocks since January, the risk of erracting trading has been pretty much understood. Your either early and waiting or day trade and win or lose big."
2021-06-06 13:02:11,wallstreetbets,"The premiums aren't that great when you go into strike territory the stock has seen countless times before (eg current trade is ~$8.50 and the stock has consistently hit above $10, premium for a $10 weekly is not all that great.) Knowing my luck the stock will slowly bleed out anyway."
2021-06-06 17:05:52,wallstreetbets,"At those rates, the numbers say just to long SPY.  Max your available margin and buy as much SPY as you can, you’re right it outperforms the market.

The issues are maintaining your interest payments (you want to have at least a year’s of payments in reserve already so you don’t have to exit when you don’t want to) and timing when you exit.

Options are going to get a lot more complex, since they are riskier and involve a specific time requirement."
2021-06-06 16:59:15,wallstreetbets,"if you call td ameritrade and bargain (tell them you're thinking of moving to ib and can bring over 100k), I think they'll lower your rate to 2% range.  something like this worked for me on etrade."
2021-06-06 17:02:32,wallstreetbets,">down the math on that a little more? Leveraged ETF expense ratios are usually way less than that, and 2% margin rates seem super low (TD's lowest is currently 7.5% on $250,000 accounts, which is below the base rate). I'm struggling to think of where the benefit is in either direction. Even if you got down to 2%, your expense ratio across your whole account would still be higher than an average 2x ETF. I'm just confused about where the Benefit fits in 

I did the math on this a while ago, it comes down to non-expense ratio costs.  no matter what happens the etf rebalances itself to try to obtain 2x leverage, whereas, over time your 2x leverage on margin will drop to 1x leverage as the asset prices increase and your margin debt drops to 0.  The actual rebalancing for the etf will incur substantial fees.  the spread on ES is \~7bps, and the fund pays this spread regularly in order to obtain this exposure."
2021-06-06 12:03:07,wallstreetbets,I don’t think I understand. If a share is borrowed then they have to return it to the lender according to the rule.. it cannot be borrowed again. They will keep track of the lent securities.

2021-06-06 13:28:50,wallstreetbets,"They told me the other day that as long as you are buying the stocks with actual cash you are fine even if it’s in a margin account. They said that they will lend out the shares that are bought on margin. It came from them though so take it with a grain of salt. 

One way to avoid this all together is to set a sell order. If you set a sell order they have to guarantee you those stocks. The problem is you can only go 50x the actual price so you just have to watch it and adjust as needed"
2021-06-06 16:24:56,wallstreetbets,Well Robbin hood restricted the rights of their investors to risk their *own* capital while TD is restricting the rights of investors to risk TD’s capital. You can still do whatever you want with your own money on TD while you couldn’t at one point in Robbin Hood.

If you are the original owner selling the puts don’t you have to buy them outright first to be able to create a put to sell? Or if you are buying 100 stocks with the goal of creating puts do you need to buy them a different way then normal?

Edit: I have been trying to understand option writing these past couple months and I came to the conclusion that if you are writing a non-naked put or call option you need to own 100 of the stock per contract. Now I understand that you only need to own them if you are writing calls, and writing puts just obligates you to buy them. I have around 1,000$ in limits set to buy stocks if they fall to a certain value. I now understand I should just write a put in the mean time of waiting so that I would benefit either way lol.

Is a naked call actually selling the stocks and having until x to replace the stocks. 

The difference is on a normal call, until I action or sell the option to buy there is no stock changing hands, yes? And a naked call means I went ahead and sold the stock before I bought them, so now I have to go replace them?

Facebook, HTC, and Sony are the actual leaders in VR. Apple is next once they drop their V1 glasses in 2022. If anything AMC should partner with Snap (Spectacles) and make going to the movies a unique and rare experience through AR."
2021-06-06 12:04:49,wallstreetbets,"How would that work though? Would you bring your own VR headset or use one of theirs? I can't imagine people wanting to put things on their faces that have been worn by 100 people before them even if they claimed to be cleaned. They'd have to figure out a cheap way to do it like 3D glasses but even still that creates tons of waste.  Well,  maybe you could buy a new foam piece that goes over the headset that's new and in a package so your face isn't resting on something that's been used?"

2021-06-06 12:57:42,wallstreetbets,"From how I understand it, and I am legitimately retarded. The issue is more that a lender may have 100k shares available to borrow, and those shares are lent multiple times each. It's no big deal if someone wants to lend a share they've purchased. The problem is one entity lending the same share to multiple other entities.

The big problem is its mutually beneficial, the lender collects fees on the same share multiple times, so they have no incentive to report. The borrowers are happy because the same share shorted multiple times puts extra downward pressure on the stock.

Putting in place a system to track each share being lent individually would help highlight this."

Sort of like how banks won’t give a person with a low credit score a loan for a house (especially if the bank plans to carry that loan)."

However, GME, BBBY and a couple others have used this moment to reinvigorate their branding thus a second life.

2021-06-06 13:13:01,wallstreetbets,I think you are correct. The issue was lenders lending 1-3x the amount of shares that were actually available to lend
2021-06-06 19:26:10,wallstreetbets,"Nope. It’s the chain of lending.

Blackrock owns crazy number of shares in its index ETFs that it legally can’t sell. But it can lend them for shorting. It does so to increase the return to offset management fees.

Those shares are borrowed and sold by short seller.

The buyer now has them in his account and can lend them a second time. 

Short seller borrows them and sells them.

Rinse. Repeat.

If you say a borrowed share has to be traced so it is not lent out a second time by the person who bought from the short seller, that borrowed share is worth less money because the buyer can’t make anything by lending it to someone else."

2021-06-06 11:39:33,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, so regardless of whether they borrowed real shares, fictitious shares or no shares, they still have to cover by buying share because they all are in reality, despite the bogus distinction, uncovered. By everyone’s admission we end up with fictitious shares being sold, even in the system of lending and borrowing shares because of multiple churns.  Calling the synthetic shares just BS’s the reality.  The moment more than one party has a right to dispose of a single share, you’ve f’d up the system of supply and demand."
2021-06-06 13:18:08,wallstreetbets,"Your last sentence is absolutely true, obviously.  I don’t understand why short selling is necessary to attain price reality? I subscribe to the market principle of supply and demand, ie if something is scarce and there’s a big demand, price will go up, and vice versa. The very essence of the supply side is that it is limited to the quantity that exists in reality and that whoever is presenting that stock as supply is a willing seller.  The mere existence of an item does not make it part of a supply. If you don’t own and control a specific stock, even if you are willing, you can’t supply it. Short selling distorts the supply side by saying even if you don’t own a stock, you can add to the supply by “borrowing” the stock. That’s the first problem. The second problem is that it opens the door to naked short selling, I hear your hypothesis that it is minimal, fact is, it is impossible to determine the extent, because what little controls are in place to put an accurate number on short sales vs naked short sales, are admittedly ineffective. The third problem, and the biggest of all, is the system of multiple layers of short sales that result in what the market calls synthetic shares, I call fictitious shares (synthetic implies made with a different man made material). Whatever we call it, it is a huge problem and results in 1 real share being short sold multiple times. Several companies even have more than 100% of their shares shorted. The real SI of real shares loaned is impossible to determine, because it is muddied with the “synthetic” shares shorted.  So we end up with a f’d up market, the price is no longer determined by legitimate supply and demand. And it’s by design my friend, because they can and because their greed is not limited by principle."

The cost of living in my city has absolutely skyrocketed the last five years as they try to price out the lower middle class. Some companies in the town pay $25 + a $7 shift premium. My company maxes out the pay at $20 plus a $1 shift premium. The company I work for is a billion dollar company. We were recently sold and it's been announced we'll see some kind of wage increase (as we continue to ship jobs to different countries for cheaper labor)

2021-06-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CPI / inflation Data + Important FED meeting coming up = 🐻💵🤑💴 So first of all I want to stress the point that I am not a financial advisor of any kind! Shorting and puts are very dangerous if done incorrectly since you can lose a lot of money really quick. Anyways here's my DD:

Next week will be a huge opportunity for puts and shorts since it is basically almost guaranteed that the markets will sell off. 

As you all know next week we will have May CPI data released. The CPI data will show how much inflation has increased since April. When CPI data is higher than expected expect a huge sell off due to inflation FUD. This will hopefully force the FED to taper bonds and hopefully monthly inflation fud will be permanently gone after July.

In the rare case that magic exist and inflation somehow got lower compared to April we will still see a sell off. Why? Because now Jerome Powell will delay the tapering because ""the economy has yet to recover"". Unless the CPI data gets out of hand I personally don't believe we will see any tapering soon and guess what the most frequently asked question to Powell is? When does the FED start tapering? And everytime he gives the same answer and everytime the market sells off because of that. 

It would be interesting to see what all the meme stocks will do during this period of fud since especially the majority AMC is owned by us retail investors. But keep in mind that even GME and AMC can and will sell off when there is peak fud across the entire market so be careful when buying OTM calls for June 16!"

Many people are not looking for labour work, many people who worked from home during the pandemic aren’t willing to leave their homes. 

I started becoming sceptical about inflation when everyone is 100% sure that it’s going to happen. Also the market dropping because of inflation isn’t FUD lmfao 

The market is dropping because investors understand modern portfolio theory and adjust their portfolios to assume less risk 

I do believe the economy has yet to recover and this has gone mostly unnoticed because tech is roughly 30-35% of the S&P"

Physically shrinking housing markets (relative to the population) are getting called growth because of price inflation that reflects increasing scarcity and increasing wealth of the rich relative to everyone else.

And now the fed is selling packaged corporate debt to the world, wonder what happens to those bonds if some of the corporations go bankrupt? Does that mean our central planners are committed to propping up those corporations at any and all cost to the public now, or is federal debt headed the way of the 2007 mortgage bond crisis, and the fed will be like those big banks pretending all is well while they secretly unload their positions?

Unless, for whatever reason, used car sales see another 10% increase, I'm fairly certain the MoM data will be poor. Anything that wasn't driven up in price by the semis/lumber shortage had little to no change in price, some fell. With lumber prices having decreased since May, I would put furnishing underperforming as well. Only semiconductor related products will keep the CPI positive.

We have been seeing very low volume selling on SPY when there is a red day, I really do think that the people who were going to rotate out of tech/growth already have done so over the past 8-10 weeks - Everyone else is still long, and will remain so.

MMs have a plan for the market, and it definitely looks like SPY has been accumulating/consolidating hard since it hit the 422.81 ATH.

You see how many people are fine not working with just and extra $300 a week? So, I believe the fed changing policy will happen, but not because of the actual currency, but because the current system is predicated on people thinking that we can’t just print money."
2021-06-06 09:42:55,wallstreetbets,Hows the gestapo gon bring down CPI?
2021-06-06 13:57:01,wallstreetbets,"Corn, copper, lumber, soybeans, and wheat are all lower a year from now. That’s all I need to know about inflation."
2021-06-06 09:16:16,wallstreetbets,"Very interesting take on the situation. I hope you a right because of my personal bias lol. If you were to be correct, how do you see the housing market reacting in the future?"
2021-06-06 10:14:27,wallstreetbets,"If this is true then inflated value only happens to one sector but this across the board.  You see inflation across all sectors. 

The economy won’t recover because it’s now crony capitalism."

2021-06-06 11:59:10,wallstreetbets,"But is it inflation or material/labor shortages?

Prices are definitely up though"
2021-06-06 14:10:26,wallstreetbets,Still they have to come clean on camera whether they will taper or not. If they say no the market will still collapse.
2021-06-06 09:13:08,wallstreetbets,Bad MoM data was the leading cause for last sell off
2021-06-06 12:39:53,wallstreetbets,"For every sell off, there will be multiple run ups. The history has proven and the markets are irrational almost all the time."
2021-06-06 14:18:05,wallstreetbets,"This a serious question? The same way they’ve done for 30 years. They just periodically change the equation and only include things that aren’t dealing with inflation. Usually goods that are seeing a production efficiency boom that is able to outpace inflation, like TV’s"

2021-06-06 19:47:20,wallstreetbets,">Corn, copper, lumber, soybeans, and wheat

A true apes diet"
2021-06-06 12:30:38,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been doing some research on this for a few months now. When the 3rd stim hit I was wondering why anyone would pass that if it wasn’t fully needed. 

The house market was my main concern. I’m still in school and I’d like to buy a house when I finish. In Toronto the average price is over 1m, and I wanted to see how sustainable/ valueable the house market really was.

The approach I took was almost the same as Michael Burry, looking at eviction rates and average down payment %. I do believe if interest rates rise that condos could drop, as most people who buy condos in Canada are doing so on a refinanced budget. If the mortgage price would surpass the average rental price, it’d create more sellers. So I’d strongly suggest following his metrics as he is one of the best skeptics out there.

As far as actual land goes, I don’t think I know enough to determine the value of that. It seems like no matter what land will always be the best thing to own and therefore valued at whatever you’re willing to pay."
2021-06-06 11:39:23,wallstreetbets,Thank god for you. I was worried I was the only one tracking watermelon prices as an inflation indicator. They'll all learn when this is over. Should have been watching the watermelons.
2021-06-06 08:46:31,wallstreetbets,What about other products??
2021-06-06 12:03:20,wallstreetbets,For one goddam watermelon?
2021-06-06 12:07:42,wallstreetbets,"I Don’t really know, but it affects CPI"
2021-06-06 10:49:42,wallstreetbets,"By bad MoM data, I meant underperforming estimates or at least a lot below last months numbers"
2021-06-06 13:45:39,wallstreetbets,well sell offs are often buying opportunities. looking to buy on the dip
2021-06-06 12:06:31,wallstreetbets,I love watching melons 🤤
2021-06-06 09:23:47,wallstreetbets,"Yes everything is more expensive. My company produces food stuffs and literally every single raw material continually goes higher. Don’t even get me started on packaging materials (plastics l, paper goods etc)"
2021-06-06 12:13:32,wallstreetbets,Are the prices soaring cause of inflation or shortages?
2021-06-06 14:04:06,wallstreetbets,Asking the real question
2021-06-06 16:44:10,wallstreetbets,To be honest I can’t be 100% sure. We make mainly pork products so the feed is super expensive which pushes up the pork prices pretty drastically. We are also dealing with disease but it seems to be subsiding. So both maybe? 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-06 16:48:34,wallstreetbets,Thanks for clarifying

If you’re not approved in underwriting for a loan, your offer won’t get chosen, and most offers are cash anyways. People are offering 50-60k over asking and houses are usually on the market for a weekend. One open house pulls in about 15-20 super good offers and the homeowner starts the process of selling a few days after going on the market. 20k down gets you laughed out of the room."

2021-06-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WOOF - Big Brain Play I think WOOF boasts very attractive upside potential with limited downside risk. If you disagree lmk why. I'm genuinely interested to know why I shouldn't have thrown half my money into this stock (I just started investing so its literally nothing - just a few grand in the Roth).

**Brief Overview:**

*The Financials*

WOOF is Petco. It is currently trading at $22.09, market cap of 5 Billion, and an 3month avg trading volume of 2.58 million and a 10 day avg trading volume of 6.17 million. In spite of Covid-19 they did $4.43B in revenue which is a slight increase from $4.39B in 2019.  First quarter of 2021 they did $1.41B. If the keep around the same performance for the rest of the year that will lead to revenues in 2021 to be around $5.6B. The Enterprise Value/EBITDA of WOOF is 27.66. But Earnings are increasing for 2021.

*The Company*

The company is making a switch from focusing on pet goods and food towards pet health and wellness. This means they are expanding to a more subscription based revenue model. They are offering deals by bundling grooming and vet-care services. They put a lot of work into their website and becoming more digital. Also they are using their brick and mortar locations as micro-distribution points. Yahoo analyst ratings are from $22-$31.

**My Reasoning for Bullish Sentiment:**

1. 3 Month Bullish Trend
2. High Institutional Ownership at 55.03%
3. Impressive Financial Success/analyst upgrades/Bullish price targets
4. Possibility of a Short Squeeze
5. Low Risk because the company is already being low-balled

I know Short Squeeze gets thrown around a lot but Im saying it based off of the numbers. The NASDAQ releases information on the short interest on stocks 2 times a month. The last reported date was May 15th. At that point in time the Short Float was around 17 million shares (an increase from the previous report) and the days to cover was 16.1. Currently the volume is way up but the price dropped indicating a sell off. Im not too sure how to interpret this in terms of which direction the short interest is likely moving in. But in a couple of days the NASDAQ will release the latest Short Interest Data. Im mainly bullish on the company, the possibility of the squeeze is just extra.

I tried to keep the post as close to facts as possible and limit my bias as best as I could. I invested in WOOF because I liked the growth potential from a Momentum/Technical Viewpoint and the Fundamentals gave me assurance in limited downside risk.

My Weakness is definitely understanding and analyzing capital structures. So any extra insight into the debt analysis and such would be helpful.

\*I got data from Yahoo finance, Google finance and Nasdaq.com"

2021-06-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD RNG potential if compared with Hydrogen & BEVs, USA (California) regulatory and legislative focus Hello everyone, 

here a DD focused on RNG and Natural Gas developments in the USA, as previous one was more broad and had the intention to outline the state of the industry worldwide.

As you may know, California has always been at the center of attention as the most advanced state in terms of decarbonization efforts. Yet, it seems that not all decisions paid back in terms of quality of life and certainty of business activity.

**Californian** **Natural Gas power plants shut down, electricity imported from other states:**

Indeed, California, different from what someone would expect, has not a good and reliable supply of electricity, probably because it pushed too aggressively for the state's 100% electrification goal (see attached picture). During the most recent blackout in August 2020, some Electric buses were forced to shut down, in order to reduce electricity demand. In the next decade, virtual power plants' alike experiments will be more popular, therefore it is reasonable to expect a better match between the demand & supply of green electricity. But it will take time and for safety reasons, it would be better to rely on different sources of energy.

* [2020-08-21 Washington Examiner: California forced to defend green goals amid blackouts](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/california-forced-to-defend-green-goals-amid-blackouts)
* [2020-08-23 Oil & Gas 360 : Green California has the nation's worst power grid](https://www.oilandgas360.com/green-california-has-the-nations-worst-power-grid/)

The first question that arises, reading these topics, is about the never-ending announcements of companies like Nikola $NKLA (very dubious business potential) and Tesla $TSLA (amazing company with incredible potential) about the incoming, quick and easy electrification of Heavy Duty Transports.

**Hydrogen Alternative Focus**

Nikola revealed its lack of technological breakthrough when it was revealed that General Motors had the intention to market a Hydrogen trucks with the Nikola brand and...... GM Fuel Cells!! The drama related to the CEO trials made the rest. I am a huge fan of hydrogen , but as Cummins $CMI CEO confirmed, hydrogen trucks have a long long way to go before being adopted on a large scale (please note that [Cummins acquired Hydrogenics in Sept. 2019](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2019/09/09/cummins-closes-its-acquisition-hydrogenics) (second global leader after $BLDP in hydrogen fuel cells). According to Cummins and others, in the next years electrolyzer segment will grow first. Note that the hydrogen fuel needed for hypothetical trucks on California's road would need green hydrogen, thus it will put more stress on the grid.. Even if it is not focused on the US, I recommend readers this report of David Fickling about global green hydrogen potential by 2050. 

[According to David Fickling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/the-hydrogen-economys-time-is-approaching/2020/05/08/383b1a04-9191-11ea-9322-a29e75effc93_story.html), hydrogen could meet 24% of the world’s energy needs by 2050, but it would likely take 31’320 TWh of electricity to hit this level. Last year, the entire world generated just roughly 26’000 TWh, of which 10’000 were coming from zero-carbon sources. By 2050 it may be achievable, but there are shorter deadlines for the transport sector. Actions today are required to match 2025 and 2030 emission targets.

If we want a high percentage of **green hydrogen**, a huge amount of grid investments is required today; high-tension grid infrastructure needs 5-10 years to be completed, therefore it is reasonable to say that hydrogen will be a sound reality for mobility from the late 2020’s on, not earlier. In addition, the potential of exhausted salt mines that could store hydrogen for months is just theoretical for now.

It is worth to remember that the sources for electricity generation in Europe are diversified and are not ready for a 100% renewable energy scenario:

* **Germany renounced to nuclear power** in 2011 and will renounce to coal by 2030, and the country is massively investing in gas pipelines, so it is very likely that it will not renounce to Russian gas.
* **France relies heavily on nuclear power**, with some of these power plants being soon too old to remain active. Therefore, traditional gas generation will be a  likely alternative to overcome this problem.
* **The UK closed all its coal power plants** but decided to keep open nuclear and gas facilities.
* **Italy** relies heavily on gas and does not have any nuclear power plant.

None of Europe’s largest countries can afford a 100% green electricity sector that can satisfy both current demand plus the incremental demand coming from the green hydrogen sector. Therefore, some fossil fuel (natural gas) and nuclear plants are here to stay for the longer term.

**BLUE HYDROGEN CANNOT BE IGNORED -** The argument is different if we include in the discussion blue hydrogen along with carbon capture. In this scenario, we would need massive incentives and research investments in carbon capture technology, which now are still at an early stage. According to the European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, [who spoke at the World Economic Forum in January 2020](https://www.ft.com/content/c93694c8-3d15-11ea-a01a-bae547046735), the EU will define the structure of a continental carbon tax by the end of this year (pre-COVID-19 intention, very likely now that the details will be published in 2021). For this reason, large trade partners like the US and China were advised to start their own studies on the tax, if they do not want their goods to be taxed at the highest possible carbon emission rate.

**HYDROGEN TRAIN FOCUS** \- An interesting case in this regard is the Hydrogen train developed by Alstom and Hydrogenics (now Cummins Inc.) whose adoption has been delayed considerably. Alstom was able to sell its innovative product to some German and French regions. Nevertheless, in most of the cases hydrogen will come from fossil sources (Rhyne region etc.), with cleaner alternatives being provided at a later stage. In the region of Schleswig Holstein, where the green potential was massive, Alstom could have got the greatest commercial order for a hydrogen product worldwide; however, the green fueling station was at the heart of a controversy between the company and the tender offer authorities of Schleswig-Holstein. For this reason, 52 trains were allocated to the battery train manufacturer and the Alstom (Hydrogenics) & NEL consortium lost the tender offer. The proposed fueling station was massive for the time, being around 20 MW capacity, [but the cost of it was at the expense of the consortium](https://www.ln-online.de/Lokales/Lauenburg/Aus-fuer-die-Wasserstoffzelle-auf-der-Schiene).

**BEV Infrastructure focus**

Tesla instead kept postponing the launch of its Tesla SEMI. You can read again the last conference call transcripts which clearly states that the biggest issue from a product perspective is the fast charger technology, whose time of realization and commercialization is yet unknown. From a macro perspective instead is unclear how California may afford to charge thousands of Tesla SEMI with its current electricity grid.

**How does $CLNE fits into all this?**

 If you look at 2020 Q2 CC of $CLNE , management made a quite useful comparison for H2 fueling stations and BEV charging stations for heavy-duty. They told the story of a recharging facility in Los Angeles that was going to be built for $5.5 million to recharge 24 heavy-duty trucks in a day’s time, in like 20-hour time, using the equivalent of the electricity needed for 44’000 homes (!!!). Thus, it is reasonable to expect not many fleet operators to switch soon to BEV trucks. 

About hydrogen refueling, management commented on the experience they got operating a hydrogen station in California with on-site hydrogen generation through electrolysis:

“*Get a load of this, it requires about 20 gallons of water (each gallon is 3.785 liters) for every gallon of hydrogen you produce. So march that out on a nationwide scale. And the idea that we're going to do it with renewable sources at a station is going to be very daunting, okay?*

*I think that as you look at commercial truck stops with hydrogen, you're probably looking at something on the order of $15 million to $20 million, or more, per station. So this is a very expensive proposition because you're basically creating a whole new network. And really, the most successful stations around the world, and there's only a handful of hydrogen, is you're reforming natural gas.”*

It is clear why some fleet operators are switching to Natural Gas Trucks. Amazon in February and the Port of LA recently, with the decision to equate BEV and other Zero Emission trucks to the Natural Gas ones. 

**US Congress ""Californification"" , not so fast**

In the past legislative period, there were some bipartisan attempts to support RNG and Natural Gas mobility. US Congress has indeed shown some interest in the subject. Last June, a bipartisan effort was introduced in both the chambers of the US congress. The bill is called “[Growing Climate Solutions Act](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/10/growing-climate-solutions-act-gives-farmers-a-seat-at-the-carbon-market-table/)” and would allow farmers to generate revenue streams from different forms of carbon capture. Most notably, methane from livestock is mentioned in the legislation. If enacted at  the federal level, decarbonized gas would receive a renovated interest from many different stakeholders. [Being a bipartisan deal](https://www.audubon.org/news/indiana-senator-mike-braun-discusses-bipartisan-climate-solutions-young-leaders), as farmers represent a prized electoral category, it should be enacted regardless of the next election results.

President Biden needs to show to his party and the American people that he is doing something about the environment. That is why he advertised the Ford BEV pickup and keeps saying that government's fleets will be electrified. As always, the political reality is much more complex than the headline announcements, and RNG has a lot of room to grow in this space. 

[Already in 2020, RNG represented 53% of all Natural Gas used in transport in the USA](https://bioenergyinternational.com/markets-finance/rng-surpassed-ng-accounting-for-53-percent-of-us-on-road-ngv-fuel-use-in-2020) . As noted in a previous DD, in California RNG is 90% of NG used in transport.

Let me know if you have further questions!

2021-06-06 06:29:37,wallstreetbets,"Yes, as I noted in my previous DD, farmers are a formidable electoral class. Politicians cannot ignore farmers and every bill that favors them is bipartisan

Long Haul truck drivers are powerful too, and current industry trends are eating their already thin profit margins. They cannot afford BEV and hydrogen trucks as are too expensive (and even if taxpayers payed for them, there will not be the grid or the hydrogen to fuel them). But regulation for truck emission is already here! Particulate and NOX are already heavily regulated thus natural gas is a good alternative 

Even Cummins, with one of the best hydrogen tech at its disposal, is saying that they do not how extended will be the time span of success for natural gas trucks. Cummins sells natural gas engines with a Canadian partner, in a jv, that expires at the end of 2021

2021-06-06 08:53:18,wallstreetbets,"My BIL is an electrical engineer and is the CEO of a large electric utility company. I have had many discussions with him about nearly everything that you mentioned here. His assessment is that we easily have enough inexpensive, relatively clean, and abundantly available natural gas to power this country for at least the next 100 years, and it has to be in our power generation equation because we are many decades away from adequate zero carbon technology. The infrastructure investment alone will take mind boggling amounts of money, and there is no viable energy storage (battery) solution yet to provide power during hours of no power generation by solar facilities and wind turbines. And, as you said, the current grid system cannot support a massive switch to BEV’s. While they are supporting zero carbon power and are making huge investments in it, there can be no getting away from the need to continue using natural gas for the foreseeable future."
2021-06-06 06:07:08,wallstreetbets,"Ahhhh interesting, what are your favorite companies within that sphere as of now?"
2021-06-06 18:21:57,wallstreetbets,Help a confused ape. I thought Europe's trains and railroad tracks were already electric. Do freight trains use different tracks/engine or something? Who would use this hydrogen train?
2021-06-06 10:21:22,wallstreetbets,Yup mods are all deleting $CLNE for some reason
2021-06-06 08:59:13,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your feedback, I very appreciate it. For light duty vehicles probably there are chances that in some regions batteries will take at least 50% of market share (but in some cases users are giving away the cars as they do not perform as they expect, yet)

For trucks I am sure that natural gas will have a much larger share of the market. In China, as noted in my previous DD, the share is 10%, Europe 4% and USA less than 2%. Western world will catch up with China 

Current revenues and income of $CLNE depend on the network of station being at 50% of capacity. This means they can handle double these volumes without further investments.

Additionally to this, RNG incentives are as much as $6 per gallon, thus jv of clne can give the company $3 per gallon. This is the reason why Amazon asked for the warrants."
2021-06-06 16:54:47,wallstreetbets,"I worked in the natural gas turbine manufacturing industry as an engineer (various roles) for several years (been automotive for about 3 now) and everything your BIL said I completely agree with. I’d speak with power gen guys who’d call the US the ‘Saudi Arabia’ of natural gas and it still seems like as a nation we simply don’t want to adapt to natural gas... at least not as quickly. 

We were always selling turbines but never at capacity. I always felt it was a shame too. GE is pulling 63% efficiency on a 7HA engine in Japan right now (current record holder for combined cycle power efficiency) and when I was still in the industry there was a 9HA engine in France that was in the high 62% efficiency range. Phenomenal efficiency when you really think about it."

2021-06-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Four undervalued growth stocks in an overvalued market. First off is huya. Huya is a twitch competitor in the Chinese region. They are mostly owned by Tencent and therefore have exclusive rights to stream Tencent games. Their current p/e works out to 25 and peg of 0.6. Excepted growth in earnings is around 44 percent this year and a potential merger is underway with a competitor that would give them a monopoly on the industry in China and thus market in-elasticity. They have a market cap of 3 billion dollars and have a whopping 1.5 billion in cash meaning losing over 50 percent is a near impossibly as the book value would exceed the share price. It’s down 60 percent from it’s peak in a growing market and i thought I’d share it with you.


Second one is General Motors. This may seem like an interesting one as General Motors is thought of a slow growing automotive company but gm currently trades at a p/e of around 10. With almost 20 billion dollars on its balance sheet. More importantly the company is on the forefront of the automotive industry. They have a controlling stake in an autonomous driving company called cruise which is now valued at 30 billion dollars or half their market cap. They have the second best battery technology on the market and they have a profitable electric car business and expect to invest 20 billion dollars into electric cars in the next couple of years. They produce battery powertrains that are extremely efficient and are the second cheapest to make and are selling it to third party companies. Overall they are on the forefront of multiple industries and are turning into more of a technology company whose future profits could very well be driven by strong software profits instead of hardware


Third one is Corsair. Corsair gaming currently trades at a p/e of around 20. Last year it had revenue growth of 75 percent and its forward pe now works out to a 15, which is extremely low for the growth of the company. As streaming picks up so has the demand for the companies products do as well they own Elgato (the biggest streaming equipment brand on earth), they also own origin pc, and are extremely good value because they can secure deals directly from Corsair giving them advantage in the sector. Overall Corsair has high growth,low pe, and an exceptional outlook.

Fourth and final one is baozun. Baozun does e-commerce distribution and management for overseas companies coming into the Chinese e-commerce market. E-commerce in China is a rapidly growing industry not expected to slow down at all in coming years and as China continues to open up it’s economy by reducing regulations on foreign brands, we should see baozun capitalise on such. It’s p/e is a bit higher then the rest at 35 but it’s expected growth of 33 percent puts that down to 27. It has a good balance sheet with 400 million in cash and also has a shopify like business for small businesses in China. Overall a great stock at a fair price."
2021-06-06 06:53:00,wallstreetbets,"i worked at GM trust me there’s a reason it looks like they haven’t been innovating, it’s because they haven’t! company is mismanaged and wasteful. Stock price is fine right now but i wouldn’t expect much positive news ever lol the company has fallen far far behind ford and VW. Not to mention their only way forward being to directly compete with tsla. 

CRSR is a good buy i agree on all points i’m buying the dip."
2021-06-06 10:00:46,wallstreetbets,"Corsair stood out the most on the list, I missed the IPO and stayed on the sidelines while it ran up 4x within a few months. Seems to have dropped and gone sideways since but im honestly not sure if this is a bottoming pattern or if its just endless sideways chop (reminds me alot of what RKT did for almost 6 months or more). I like the revenue, net income and I use the products, they will very likely be around for next 10 years if they are not eventually bought out.

That being said I would probably like to get in on a bigger pull back to load up heavy ($18-20 range would be ideal but may never show up again). ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)"

2021-06-06 07:47:08,wallstreetbets,"I'd like more DD on GM. I get where your going with it but I just don't have a ton of faith in the company overall. Cadillac, as a brand struggles heavily against basically every other luxury mark. Their Chevy line up has been unremarkable for awhile now with the only real stand out IMO being the truly impressive C8 Corvette. 

Looking at their electric vehicles a month or so ago, I would agree that they were doing well with that respect. But I think the forward thinking attitude of Ford with the F150 Lightning has really highlighted the shortcomings of most other automakers electric options. 

One of the major things that made Tesla successful was their vision for an electric car that was not as good or indistinguishable from an ICE car but was fundamentally different and to some or many, better. Ford took a similar approach to the Lightning with options such as the battery backup for your house and the power outlets in the Frunk for tools. 

To me, I think automakers, such as GM, who are producing electric cars that they market as equal to ICE cars will struggle compared to vehicles presented as equal, but better. 

I'm not trying to state that GM won't go up, or that their cars are uniquely subpar. I'm also not trying to say Tesla and Ford are great. I'm simply highlighting a few areas in which I see challenges for the company that could negatively impact growth potential."

Also Corsair is a great company! I also loaded up on the dip, although it seems quite manipulated to be under the 35 dollar mark, of which if the stock surpasses could provide a decent breakout."

2021-06-06 07:57:20,wallstreetbets,"I like this take. I would agree my biggest worry about General Motors is the brand image presented with both Cadillac and Chevy, but I also think with the presence of new brands from General Motors, like we have seen in recent years with their Chinese division that could change? Although personally I’m less focused on the cars themselves but the technologies behind them. Such as the big battery push from General Motors and being the supplier of electric powertrains, batteries and other things they are beating out other automakers in. I also do think Chevy has a good chance of reviving its excitement factor in the future, and the Chevy bolt seems to be performing nicely in ev markets undercutting most on pricing. I also think the cruise approach to self driving cars is very promising and I Believe the long term value of that division is something that makes General Motors a long term hold. General Motors has also been investing in various other brands and supplying them with capital for operations, I could see gm increasing its stake in those automakers or creating a new brand to help with the weaker image."

2021-06-06 11:30:33,wallstreetbets,"personally no idk enough about the auto industry. i’m a software engineer, and buy mostly software and computer hardware stocks.

i just would avoid gm specifically due to my personal experience. Not sure if ford is a buy"
2021-06-06 19:28:09,wallstreetbets,"ford is just now above its price from 5 years ago. it is cheap so if you are fine watching it tank 40% go a head and throw 1-2 grand at it. 

i am not even green in it currently...

I went with GM.

ford was rumored to be one of the fallen angles that had to be helped out by the  FEDs last year because they have about as much debt as they do revenue."
2021-06-06 08:22:16,wallstreetbets,"I want to agree with you on the technology front. My issue is that GM is at its core, a car company. While it's investments in promising technology companies is encouraging for the future competitiveness of their vehicles, looking at the valuation of those technology companies I suspect that they will not be exclusively selling to GM. This would reduce the impact those technologies have on GMs competitiveness. 

Regardless, I think you have a point on this that's worth investigating further."
2021-06-06 14:18:12,wallstreetbets,"Why do we need mergers when there is cash to the tits and revenue growth? unless these numbers are fake, I am seeing major health in the balance sheet and it does not seem to be similar to futuristic highly speculative stocks like workhorse or plug or wtvr. We seen to have revenues and earnings NOW. Looks conservative to me. I am using simply wall st to analyze the numbers. They are so healthy that I want to check other platforms to verify them"
2021-06-06 17:48:24,wallstreetbets,"I worked for GM, go talk to mechanic before go there"
2021-06-06 05:15:22,wallstreetbets,"It hasn’t been innovating at the same rate it currently is. It’s subsidiaries have very promising futures and it’s Chinese growth is phenomenal. Gm has potential unlike it’s had in the past. Just my opinion. But it’s autonomous driving business is outright brilliant, as with it’s collaborative ev effort in China."
2021-06-06 05:21:21,wallstreetbets,"""Past performance is not an indicator of future performance""."
2021-06-06 08:49:08,wallstreetbets,"Wasn’t a sleight , just saying take a look if you are into e-commerce. Used e commerce out performing Vroom and Lots . Just added to Russell . About to open 4 more states. Gonna get crazy ."
2021-06-06 13:37:03,wallstreetbets,That does not make it a growth stock though lol
2021-06-06 09:45:15,wallstreetbets,"Can't just look at P/E.  Ford has a Price to Earnings Growth of .24 (anything under 1 is considered undervalued).  GM is at 1.16 (slightly overvalued, but a decent investment, IMO).  Future earnings matter.  And Ford has the edge.  Just for reference, TSLA is at 3.46."
2021-06-06 10:44:37,wallstreetbets,"You’re correct. I have close friends that are engineers at GM and whatever the hell Chrysler’s new name is. 

GM is way ahead of them all from the sounds of the conversations I’ve had with them.

Ford is a bad play lol"
2021-06-06 08:50:06,wallstreetbets,Of short positions that is.
2021-06-06 08:49:13,wallstreetbets,Yea it’s a good company. Seems very manipulated under the 35 price point. Let’s hope we break through and we could possibly see liquidations.
2021-06-06 08:36:08,wallstreetbets,Yea that totally undermines the whole company lmao
2021-06-06 11:47:49,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Like the Corsair idea?
2021-06-06 14:20:00,wallstreetbets,I have checked other platforms. The numbers are true. They are criminally unvalued and the market has over estimated the need for a merger. The merger going through tho would make this at least a ten billion dollar stock.
2021-06-06 05:26:05,wallstreetbets,"I know what you're saying as I've done some research about the company but at this stage is like investing in a biotech company at its beginnings, it is promising but will it be able to deliver enough in order to compete with giants such as Toyota and VW? Not to mention Tesla, which like it or not, has a strong and ever growing position in the EV market."
2021-06-06 08:49:48,wallstreetbets,I’ll have a look thank you!
2021-06-06 13:42:58,wallstreetbets,Yes it does. A growth stock by definition is a stock with high potential for development.
2021-06-06 09:54:10,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. My other points still stand. I firmly believe long term growth in gm will outdo Ford if their technology keeps advancing at the same rate.
2021-06-06 19:21:40,wallstreetbets,ford also has as much debt as they do in revenue...
2021-06-06 09:10:53,wallstreetbets,I bought that Friday dip. We should wait for Logitech report first :)
2021-06-06 08:38:51,wallstreetbets,Anyway apes are too retarded to invest anything other than amc bb gme 😂
2021-06-06 11:54:39,wallstreetbets,"yep AMD, TSM, CRSR, PLTR are the ones I have my eye on currently. I just think they’re gonna be the industry leaders in next 10-15 years and that’s my time horizon. Do your dd on these companies, strong balance sheets and good management decision, big innovation."
2021-06-06 14:34:10,wallstreetbets,"I am on morningstar checking that now. I am seeing a price to book of 2.2 which is epic, and the lowest PE they have had. Since I only found out about this one today, I have no emotions about merger, and dont really see the need for one. I am very excited to keep learning about this one, thank you so much!"
2021-06-06 05:55:21,wallstreetbets,"Well it’s not like it’s a small company. Not only that but it is competing and outdoing both vw and toyota in both autonomous driving and battery efficiency and costs and it’s cruise subsidiary is competing fiercely with Tesla’s autopilot. It has the second most efficient powertrain, second cheapest by a significant margin on a per kw basis and is on of the only brands producing profitable electric cars. It’s growth in China has made it the top selling ev in the country with growth expected to stay steady. It’s also planned 20 billion dollars into Evs while Toyota is reluctant to do anything except hydrogen and Volkswagen is behind in every aspect of the ev market comparative to gm. At this point we should be asking can Volkswagen and Toyota catch up to gm instead of the other way around. I think Tesla will remain strong but the argument isn’t that gm beats out Tesla, but that is competes with it. If you get what I mean. And on a risk adjusted basis gm seems like a better investment then the latter."
2021-06-06 05:57:12,wallstreetbets,I totally understand this viewpoint. It’s just quite subjective and personally I see more value and future growth in gm then other automotive companies (besides Tesla if we are purely going on a growth perspective)
2021-06-06 13:44:50,wallstreetbets,"No, it's a value stock 

9 pe vs. 16 industry avg"
2021-06-06 10:03:17,wallstreetbets,"I think if you're investing in EV, F and GM have been long overlooked.  All the minor players, at least RIDE and NIO are going to be put out of business.  Maybe bought out later, but it will be at a much lower price than current.  


TSLA will be a player, but they are way overvalued, IMO."
2021-06-06 09:13:40,wallstreetbets,Bought at 30 a week or two ago. But yea we will definitely have to see Logitech’s report and pray we go to the moon 😂
2021-06-06 19:25:17,wallstreetbets,"made a good amount on logitech on the run up but didn't get back in during sell off earlier this year. Went with amd which doesn't want to do fuck all currently. 

it is already above what I think it will trade at with companies going back to the office."
2021-06-06 11:55:33,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Have a great day!
2021-06-06 14:35:00,wallstreetbets,"Awesome man, glad I helped."
2021-06-06 06:26:27,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate your comment, I reckon it's a valid point of view on the matter and I also agree on some of the things.
However, as long as the EV market share will not become a substantial part of the market, GM will be lagging behind VW and Toyota on car sales (we are talking about other 8/10 years if not even more).
I don't know much about Toyota specifically but with regards to VW group, I think you should go read about how their business developed in the last year and what are their EV-related ongoing projects. I wouldn't say it is ""behind in every aspect...comparative to GM"" at all.
Lastly, if we'd evaluate them exclusively according to their financials, GM is not in a very good shape, they all have a high debt/equity ratio but GM one is even higher compared to others and in the event of bad times ahead for markets, GM is not well positioned in my opinion."
2021-06-06 13:48:05,wallstreetbets,You do realise a stock can be both…. They aren’t mutually exclusive.
2021-06-06 10:06:34,wallstreetbets,"100 percent agree. Looking for entry into Tesla at some point if the price comes down to around the 100-200 billion dollar range, otherwise I think both gm and Ford are strong with my preference being for gm. I agree most of the minor ones will likely run into capital issues because of the capital intensive business required to operate an automotive company."
2021-06-06 11:14:00,wallstreetbets,Too late to get on the Ford train? Been on a bit of a run.
2021-06-06 17:28:29,wallstreetbets,"so I need to figure out two things to nail this down. Would love to hear your take on it.
1) Is the merger officially canceled for sure, or its just pre-emtpive fears with no evidence?
2) why do we need the merger? what's wrong with continuing on its own?"
2021-06-06 06:28:22,wallstreetbets,"Let’s agree to disagree. You have good points, I think I have some good points. We’ll just have to see how it plays out. Appreciate the discourse dude 👍"
2021-06-06 06:30:17,wallstreetbets,"I did read vw business reports, and I believe they still are behind on a cost basis per kw and their battery technology isn’t up to par with ultium as of yet? But that could change, like I said we will just have to see."
2021-06-06 13:49:20,wallstreetbets,"Value stocks are a good bet for investors who want the potential for big gains without the risk that comes along with sky-high valuations. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI) are two value stocks that could easily double if the market buys into their respective strategies. Here's what you need to know.

The internal combustion engine finally appears to be on its way out. While electric vehicles still account for a small portion of overall vehicle sales today, that's almost guaranteed to change over the next decade. Tesla is an early leader, selling around half a million electric cars annually, but the traditional automakers shouldn't be counted out.

General Motors plans to launch 30 electric vehicle models by 2025, and it hopes to only be selling zero-emissions vehicles by 2035. The company is banking on its Ultium battery technology to vastly lower battery pack costs and make the whole electric vehicle operation profitable.

GM is also aiming beyond passenger vehicles. The company recently announced BrightDrop, a new brand that will focus on electric delivery vehicles and related products and services. BrightDrop could eventually become a significant business for GM; it hit the ground running with FedEx as a major customer.

On top of GM's electric vehicle ambitions, the company owns a majority stake in autonomous vehicle start-up Cruise, which was valued at $30 billion after its latest funding round. The long-term potential of autonomous vehicle technology is enormous, even if it takes a very long time for fully self-driving personal vehicles to become a reality. Autonomous tech should find applications in logistics and other commercial markets, and it may enable GM to offer subscription services that improve the company's profitability.

The market is valuing GM stock at a steep discount to the broad market indices. GM expects to produce adjusted earnings per share between $4.50 and $5.25 in 2021, which puts the price-to-earnings ratio at roughly 10. That guidance includes the negative impact of the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, and the PE ratio doesn't factor in GM's stake in Cruise.

GM still needs to prove itself in the electric car market. But if the company can convince investors that it can smoothly make the transition away from gas-powered vehicles, a more optimistic valuation and a much higher stock price could be in GMs' future.

Basic apparel and activewear manufacturer Hanesbrands got through the pandemic by spinning up a personal protective equipment business, selling masks and other garments and generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue in the process.

While the PPE business was once viewed as a long-term opportunity, Hanesbrands has now shifted gears. The company wrote off its PPE inventory and is now focused on going after younger consumers and growing its e-commerce business. The company's Champion brand has been growing in popularity, but its core Hanes brand doesn't have the same appeal.

Hanesbrands' plan involves cutting its lineup of SKUs by 20% to focus on high-volume products, exploring strategic alternatives for its European innerwear business, further growing the Champion brand, launching innerwear brands and products that appeal to younger consumers, and building out a bigger e-commerce business. Hanesbrands currently depends heavily on big-box retailers and department stores.

If Hanesbrands' strategy pays off in the form of sustainable growth and improved profitability, the stock could soar. Analysts are expecting Hanesbrands to produce adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 this year, which works out to a price-to-earnings ratio of just over 11. Similar to GM, a higher multiple and stock price could be in order if Hanesbrands can sell investors on its growth story."
2021-06-06 13:49:47,wallstreetbets,"yes, they are"
2021-06-06 12:20:13,wallstreetbets,I don’t think it’s too late. I’ve had shares in Ford for 5 years now and it’s where I put money that I don’t have a plan for. I don’t plan on selling until maybe another 5 years.
2021-06-06 12:13:57,wallstreetbets,"Depends on whether you believe in technical analysis or not.  Resistance, according to [Barchart.com](https://Barchart.com) trader cheat sheat, at 16.35, 16.73 and 17.01  Support at 15.69  I bought in at around $15, so still holding.  I think the intermediate price target is around  17.75, and support around 13.60."
2021-06-06 17:30:50,wallstreetbets,Speculation based on some actions of anti trust against Tencent (who is majority owner in huya) and the company doesn’t need the merger to perform. But the merger gives the company a monopoly on game streaming and thus it can increase its margins significantly and yield a lot more returns for investors. Personally idc too much about the merger. Good stock all round irrespective
2021-06-06 06:36:26,wallstreetbets,Deal. I will be either right or jumping on the bandwagon so nothing to lose here for me haha
2021-06-06 13:55:02,wallstreetbets,What does copying and pasting prove?
2021-06-06 13:56:35,wallstreetbets,Nope. A value stock is any stock that appears to be underpriced in the market relative to it’s fundamentals. A growth stock is a stock with high potential for development. Many companies with high growth can be considered both value and growth stocks in tandem
2021-06-06 14:51:12,wallstreetbets,Thanks! I guess I will be selling 13 dollar puts then lol
2021-06-06 18:38:19,wallstreetbets,"I see, so the idea is that the govt wont allow any monopoly, so its speculated that the merger will be canceled to avoid monopoly status. However it has not officially been canceled. I like it because either way its good"
2021-06-06 13:56:22,wallstreetbets,"it's not a growth stock shut the fuck up lol 

being undervalued is the fucking opposite of being a growth stock. it's a value stock with room to grow and it is undervalued. value. stock."
2021-06-06 13:57:14,wallstreetbets,nope you are wrong
2021-06-06 13:57:20,wallstreetbets,Not how growth stocks work. Growth stocks are not based on stock price growth but the underlying growth of the company. Silly argument.
2021-06-06 13:58:27,wallstreetbets,Whatever you say China. That’s just not true tho

2021-06-06 10:53:07,wallstreetbets,"Thinking an increase in cyberattacks is going to lead to more people using blackberry phones I'd a bizarre stretch. Their platform was ""more secure"" because their app marketplace was so restricted and they built corporate policy controls into their OS. All OSses have that now, and have for a long time.

Now the QNX driverless cars angle, that's good fundamentals. But bb as an emerging phone company is nonsense."
2021-06-06 11:01:41,wallstreetbets,Well..... Not profitable
2021-06-06 14:09:49,wallstreetbets,I was thinking the same 😂😂

2021-06-06 11:59:46,wallstreetbets,It licenses the Production of phones now I think. I think the poster is commenting that BB does cyber security. Like for the pc. No idea where you saw phones.

2021-06-06 13:11:38,wallstreetbets,In terms of cash flow yes profitable
2021-06-06 08:56:57,wallstreetbets,I dropped Robinhood after that shit with GME. I’ve been using Fidelity now. I’m not big time investor but every little bit less Robinhood has the better.
2021-06-06 16:43:32,wallstreetbets,"Ive been using webull, highly recommend"
2021-06-06 10:40:26,wallstreetbets,"Undervalued. The wallstreet is thinking they still make keyboard phones!! The company is leader in cyber security protecting over half billion endpoints. They protect entire US and NATO military. Their qnx is even bigger, basically protecting all cars produced that connect to internet. All adas and ev car run on bb qnx. This is not priced in because everyone thinks they make only phones. They don’t make phone hardware but are a software company. Their peers with inferior cyber security are valued at 50bil! Bb at only 8bil today! 

WSB caught onto this undervalued company and spreading the message. Go ask anyone what bb does and you will know not many know about their full transformation to cyber security leader and car operating system and data leader. 

Good luck!!! 🍀"
2021-06-06 10:42:10,wallstreetbets,Btw the only company’s whose client didn’t get impacted from recent ransomeware hack is bb! This is why Airforce switched to bb late last year.
2021-06-06 11:19:20,wallstreetbets,"It's a meme stock none the less, despite solid fundamentals.  Something BB fan's probably shouldn't be happy about, but it is something to take advantage of.

2021-06-06 15:39:10,wallstreetbets,I bought 1 option for $7 when it was literally the bottom of the dip. It's a july $1.50 C and its now worth like $30 something.

2021-06-06 09:07:41,wallstreetbets,"Same. I bought in way to high but I knew it was high so didn’t yolo. As it kept dipping I just kept doubling down. Now my average is below a buck now and I’m comfortably in the green with way more shares than I would have bought originally. Why do people yolo at all time highs? Do y’all really hate money that much? 

The image in my head is just walking around a casino only putting dollars in slots that just hit the jackpot... We can only blame so much on our silky smooth brains, the rest is all just being addicted to red.

2021-06-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BB ideas for Monday Disclaimer: I got out from $BB on Friday.

$BB dropped below $14.30 (50% Fib Retracement mark). This mark was tested and rejected multiple time from Thursday through Friday. However at around 2pm $BB dropped bellow. Bulls immediately tried regaining this level but got rejected and we closed below. The next level is 61.8%, $13. Bulls must hold this one in my opinion. There's a big hole that is still unfilled when $BB gapped up from June 1st to 2nd. If $BB goes below $13, then we might retest June 1st closing of $11.56 and 78.6% retracement mark of $11.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Pv2AQcyz/

Volume on Friday also wasn't great. Comparing it to Thursday is a bit unfair since that was a record breaking day. That being said, Friday volume was a half of what it was on Wednesday. This was also $BBs first negative day of this run. Looking back to January, first negative day of that run also coincided with lower volume and that was basically the end of that run. Volume was keep decreasing since that day going forward. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/onHdg7BE/

On Monday:

* If $BB opens above $14.30, it will most likely try and retest 50% retracement again. If we hold above, might be a good place to jump back in. 

* If $BB opens between $14.30 and $13, just wait and see, that's noman's land. If $BB starts to slide then I'm looking for a strong rejection at $13 before even thinking about jumping back in. If we go below $13, then there are good chances we'll retest $11.5 and $11 marks. If $BB starts the morning strong and goes up, watch what happens at $14.30. Going above and stabilizing that is a good sign. 
* And of course I'm looking for better volume than last Friday if there's to be continuation of this run."

2021-06-06 08:41:33,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate the post and viewpoint. I agree, and Monday June 7 is set up exactly like BB was set up for Monday Feb 2nd, which was a big drop after a thursday peak and a bloody low-volume friday. 

I think there's something to be said that we were hit with a 4-day trading week in the middle of a bull run, and weekends really put a damper on meme stock hype. You can rely on low energy, profit taking, and wait-and-see attitudes on fridays for GME, AMC, BB. If we had had memorial day to build, the peak might have climbed closer to our price targets. That also said, mondays at open tend to be high energy tests with these stocks, and anything can happen.

I'm still deep into BB but I'm ok with saying that its not looking good."
2021-06-06 11:19:24,wallstreetbets,I was making decent profit when it hit 19 earlier this week. Then last couple days it just dropped. Is this the end of BB being a meme stock? Will it reach those heightz again? I wish i took my gains when it hit 19

2021-06-06 02:29:47,wallstreetbets,Disregard all the asshats saying you can’t do technical analysis on a meme stock. What does that even mean? These fools don’t even have the slightest idea what your talking about so how could they possibly have a legit opinion about it. They are just regurgitating bs they have seen other idiots say on here. I’ve been trading GME on the technicals for months and it’s been great. Your ta is sound and I’m listening.

2021-06-06 04:36:12,wallstreetbets,I would argue that technical factors and support/resistance based on volume by price are the ONLY factors driving price movements on the meme names. We know they certainly are not moving based on fundamentals.

2021-06-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ZIP DD First off this is not financial advice; just my personal opinion on a recent IPO that has a lot of room to run. ZIPRecruiter (ZIP) is undervalued and in the sweet spot of a massive secular trend; my DD has me convinced that this stock could break out.
 
First off, it’s important to realize that pretty much every employed person in America is considering a job change now that the pandemic is easing up. For the past year and a half, people have stuck it out in terrible jobs mostly because they were happy to have stable employment at the time, and also nobody was hiring. Now that the economy is taking off and companies are trying to hire again, most workers are going to test the waters. Recent estimates from Microsoft are that 40% of US employees will switch companies this year, and other surveys found that at least 26% of workers leave their companies will find new work. Experts are calling it the “Great Resignation of 2021”. The numbers are impossible to predict, but just think about all the people in your own friend groups that have been complaining about their jobs for months and are trying to make a change.
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-great-resignation-of-2021-are-30-of-workers-really-going-to-quit/ 
 
So if you agree that the labor markets are unfrozen and people will be taking advantage of it, how can you make money off it? Look at the software companies that will power/enable this big trend. Staffing / recruiting companies that offer this as a service will benefit, but they don’t scale well. If Manpower Group or Kelley Services has an extra 10 job applicants, they may need to hire an extra recruiter (costs go up as revenues go up). With software platforms, the new job applicants add volume with no incremental costs. 

The biggest recruiting tool of all is LinkedIn, but that’s owned by MSFT and is just a sideshow to their main business. Other large software players in the HR Tech space have recruiting tools, such as GOOG, SAP, WDAY, ADP, CDAY, etc – but again the recruiting platform is on the periphery of what they do... so not a core competency of any big players. Besides these guys, the market is fragmented. There are thousands of job boards, recruiting firms, talent agencies and staffing companies that will help match applicants to companies, but there is only one standalone software company that focuses on recruiting that is publicly traded: ZIP.
https://ideal.com/top-recruiting-software/
 
How does ZIP make money and why do they stand out? The platform is free for individual people to look for jobs, but companies will sign up for recurring accounts where they create jobs and post them into the platform. ZIP is a job aggregator, meaning it takes the job posting and replicates this on thousands of job boards across the world, and then brings back quality candidates to the companies. For employees, it will match you with dozens of roles based on what you are looking for. And because most jobs are virtual/remote now, this software opens up new roles and opportunities that previously a person wouldn’t have considered.
 
Now here’s where it really gets interesting. ZIP went public a few weeks through a direct listing, with no fanfare or hype. Unless you really follow the HR software IPO market, you wouldn’t even know that this happened. Shares currently trade around $24 and the company has a market cap of $2.5B.

ZIP has an EV/Rev ratio of ~9x, which is under the big players above: MSFT = 10x, CDAY = 14x, WDAY = 11x, etc… meaning it’s cheaper to buy a share of ZIP than a fully diversified software company that has products in multiple categories. If recruiting is going to grow gangbusters this year as the economy rebounds, how come ZIP is trading at a discount to larger companies that have smaller expected growth rates?
 
I’m not a professional stock picker, so this is just my speculation, but I think there are 4 reasons why ZIP isn’t getting any love (yet)

1. They are too small. $2.5B market cap is a rounding error to a company like MSFT, GOOG, or WDAY.
2. In 2020, ZIP had a negative growth year (2019 revenues of $430M went down (3%) in 2020 to $418M). Professional investors don’t like that, especially when every other software company went gangbusters in 2020. Well let’s dig into that… why did ZIP’s revenue decrease in 2020? BECAUSE NOBODY WAS LOOKING FOR JOBS AND COMPANIES WEREN’T HIRING NEW PEOPLE. It was a pandemic and nobody was doing anything except watching netflix. 
3. The company had a Q1 earnings call in between filing the IPO paperwork but before the stock was trading. Management had a lot of great things to say (they basically argued that this is an unprecedented time in the recruiting market and they are well poised to capture it), but I honestly don’t think anyone was paying attention
4. On the earnings call, the management said that Q2 is going to be huge (80% growth when compared to Q2 2020) but then the second half of the year could ramp down if people stop switching jobs. Perhaps analysts didn’t like that, but isn’t that obvious? As long as the economy keeps picking up steam, ZIP is going to do well.
 
TL/DR – ZIP is a stock worth taking a look at; I feel they will fly under the radar until Q2 earnings when they will explode. I’m not a financial advisor, so do you your own research too. I LIKE THE STOCK!! I picked up 1200 shares last week."

Cybersecurity 
IOT 

The key catalysts will be:

1) upcoming patent sale of mobile phone patents - this helps to give the company cash in order to enhance their new business strategies. We are looking at 38,000 patents which will at least bring in 1-2 billion usd

2) cybersecurity - the time is now. Management has successfully integrated cylance into the BB products and are ready to go to market. They have been hiring aggressively and will be growing their market share on this from this year on.

3) IOT - IN short, IVY and QNX related. This will come slightly later in 2022 onwards and we will see steady traction of the growth when more cars shift to autononous driving. PLEASE NOTE that this does not even require cars to be FULLY autononous.

2021-06-06 08:29:56,wallstreetbets,Should've bought in before the hype when it was at 8$ literally like 2 weeks ago..
2021-06-06 00:11:28,wallstreetbets,"Can someone explain the shituation with BB?

Is it shorted? Is it about to release new tech/deals with other industry players? Or is it just a meme stock?

Obviously it's a meme stock but is it JUST a meme stock."
2021-06-05 22:59:05,wallstreetbets,This happend after the media said that BB was a short squeeze play????

2021-06-06 03:02:31,wallstreetbets,If you see ppl post gains just know it's probably to late and you shouldn't go to the hype.    Has happened alot.  Those ppl are the ones that been holding for a while with God like patience.  You can't expect to go in and get a profit like them
2021-06-06 04:23:38,wallstreetbets,20k in at19.24 pr share
2021-06-06 05:35:08,wallstreetbets,It’s not a loss if you don’t sell.
2021-06-06 07:45:30,wallstreetbets,"OP hold, unless they go BK, you can't loose:

Eventually the stock will bottom out, and then the price will slowly creep back up with the inflation. In a few decades you are almost garanteed the stock will go back to 17$!

You litterally can't loose if you're patient enough and only focus on the price!"
2021-06-06 08:20:07,wallstreetbets,185 @ $14.72. I averaged up lol
2021-06-06 01:20:59,wallstreetbets,"I bought 190 shares at 21.05 on Thursday morning right at the exact wrong time cause I basically didn't know any better and just wanted to get in thinking it was about to take off. But if it takes off I won't care cause this is my first ever stock investment and I'll be happy even if I could've got more shares for my $ if I had waited an hour to buy.
Edit: I think a lot of what I read here is USD but mine is CAD. So that would be 17$ average for me. Makes me feel better at least."
2021-06-05 23:49:00,wallstreetbets,I got 198 @ 10.76 I wish I bought more. Still holding too btw
2021-06-06 02:18:30,wallstreetbets,Shoulda bought in AMC with that cash.  Maybe then I wouldn't be -$6783 in that
2021-06-06 00:16:34,wallstreetbets,and in RH. A true autist
2021-06-06 01:23:37,wallstreetbets,Right there with you! Jet fuel igniting this week—hang in there!

2021-06-06 05:34:08,wallstreetbets,We on the way 💸💸
2021-06-06 08:24:34,wallstreetbets,"520 @ 14.21 now. was 200 deep at 12.1 but decided Thursday morning to buy (what I thought would be the dip) another 120 around 17.5-18. . Would have felt better selling a 100 or so to at least stay a little in the green but it is what it is. Hopefully, the price can hold above $15 by the end of this week and BB sees an influx of AMC profit-takers looking for the next move."
2021-06-06 09:39:57,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry we are coming for you brother
2021-06-06 10:12:08,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain this to me since I'm new? It looks like bb isn't shorted so how do we know it will go up? I got average of 16$ but it seems like when it hit 20$ last week all the people that were holding before cashed out and now it's bleeding out. How do we know it will go up again?
2021-06-06 11:32:52,wallstreetbets,Why do you think BB happening?.
2021-06-05 22:48:53,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-06-05 23:31:03,wallstreetbets,Sell a covered call for end of the week and start recouping that money

2021-06-06 17:00:22,wallstreetbets,"Should sell, only retards with 1-3k buy meme stocks... you had 100k.. I’ve been buying blue chips since 35k, now 72k inna year"
2021-06-05 23:34:53,wallstreetbets,100k and u didn’t put it on gme or amc?
2021-06-06 02:20:00,wallstreetbets,"You know people hate on Robinhood, but I love the look of their app."
2021-06-06 11:29:30,wallstreetbets,"What is happening with WSB?! Another post of BB from a profile with only one post and the only comments it had is for this post. And we see so many of this... More and more we realizing that this are just distractions and most probably some HF strategy to screw apes. I know some members bought BB because they beleive it, but the large majority of posts and comments we see in this sub is clearly bots and low karma/new profiles. Everyone be careful and be aware, don't fall for fakes"
2021-06-05 23:26:25,wallstreetbets,Down 20k but have the bankroll to toss in 100k lol I think you good
2021-06-06 01:00:14,wallstreetbets,It will go up with AMC. If you're confident in the AMC squeeze then I wouldn't worry about it.
2021-06-06 02:58:03,wallstreetbets,"right there with you with 3225 shares, adding more on Monday"
2021-06-05 22:59:02,wallstreetbets,Why do bagholders always trade on Robinhood?
2021-06-06 01:00:00,wallstreetbets,"This is the way!

Buy then buy more higher, THEN SELL LOW! 🚀"
2021-06-06 03:29:12,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for taking those bags off of my hands, was holding since $10"
2021-06-06 09:46:36,wallstreetbets,Then we have people buying AMC at 50??? Really? Just idiotic.
2021-06-06 04:22:36,wallstreetbets,Where does a punk ass kid get $90k from other than mommy and daddy.
2021-06-05 23:13:41,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-06 00:00:32,wallstreetbets,How do you have fractional shares of a non-dividend stock?
2021-06-06 03:30:58,wallstreetbets,"Grats, you are now a long term holder."

2021-06-06 10:09:57,wallstreetbets,"Shoulda bought Gamestop, it's not too late you know"
2021-06-06 12:39:20,wallstreetbets,"There was a lot of media hype for BB to try to get people to drop AMC and switch to BB. 
I have screen shots claiming BB is soaring because people were abandoning AMC to get BB. When in fact, it was down which I also have screen shots of. Those dirty bastards are so crooked!

Edit: Good luck OP!"
2021-06-05 23:13:55,wallstreetbets,Didn't BB already squeeze? Every time I ask this I'm wrong so I think I already know the answer
2021-06-05 23:33:56,wallstreetbets,Ouch. You're not coming back from that one.
2021-06-05 22:54:47,wallstreetbets,Buy a put option or 2 next time in order to limit/mitigate downside risk entirely.  Just a hedge
2021-06-06 00:17:38,wallstreetbets,The squeezed happened already
2021-06-06 01:37:59,wallstreetbets,Bots bots bots! Buy bots!! /s

2021-06-06 09:15:18,wallstreetbets,U guys got trapped with bb ...
2021-06-06 10:17:05,wallstreetbets,"doubt it will be back above 15 any time soon , not sure what made you think it was a good idea to buy at 17 but hey you have alot more more money than most of us so this bet is just another bet for you."
2021-06-06 11:37:57,wallstreetbets,AMC first
2021-06-06 02:23:32,wallstreetbets,But AMC and GME is the focus right now. BB is FUD for the moment.
2021-06-06 02:32:36,wallstreetbets,I shorted when you bought.  Monday looking sweet for me and WSB shorts.
2021-06-05 23:31:36,wallstreetbets,BB is the wrong stock. It’s like buying AMCX
2021-06-05 23:50:18,wallstreetbets,You’re not alone. 80% of this sub is also 50% under on GME and now 25% on AMC. Everyone here just telling people to buy cus they can’t get out.
2021-06-06 00:34:57,wallstreetbets,Which app ia this?

2021-06-06 10:11:59,wallstreetbets,"Okay guys why are you going all in when the price rockets?

Why dont you take 5% of your money and put it in, observe the price and than put in another 5% ooooooooooooooor, wait one day and check if you could buy more cheaper?

When you guys make coffee, do you put the whole pack of powder into one cup? Do you put the whole pack of butter on one slice of bread? I am seriously baffled here."

2021-06-06 11:26:43,wallstreetbets,"Well, for the first time, I also got a letter from the broker, saying that one of my leveraged products had more than a 10% loss. It is actually close to 30 percent, but I am in good spirit it will bounce back before it reaches the knockout value :)

Would like once a letter starting with ""Warning : One of your investment is gaining more than 10 percent! Danger!"" :D"
2021-06-06 11:26:58,wallstreetbets,Don't look at it as a bad thing. Look at it as a discount. Now you get to buy more to average down.

Ask me how I know haha. It'll bounce, but it now needs to run through the process. It had it's full float in trading day last week that brought it more short interest. T - 2 months or so for pop."

2021-06-06 16:02:00,wallstreetbets,"BB will reach 25 again only if AMC/GME moons. If not, it will require 6 months of consistent buying pressure to reach 25 again. And even then, it isn’t a strong play by any means since it has low SI and low utilization. On top of that, BB isn’t a great company to start with. Better to stay with AMC/GME and buy the dips. You can make more in 1 well-timed dip buy there than in a few months of BB bag holding."
2021-06-06 16:02:56,wallstreetbets,Just add blue and yellow and make green.
2021-06-06 16:09:19,wallstreetbets,I saw a post during the week that BB is just a distraction from AMC and GME by the mutual funds. What say you OP??

2021-06-06 12:28:17,wallstreetbets,"So what’s going on with the meme stock BCRX on the list. This is the most perfect set up for all the APES to make a good and solid profit many times their original investments. The reason is simple. You have a biotech company, which has already an FDA approved superior drug ( already approved in Europe, Japan India) taken orally with 3 times greater efficacy than the competition, which all rely on injections by patients or doctors. In addition their drug must be kept refrigerated  with additional problems. The drug Orladeyo, conservatively is projected to   bring in $500 millions the first year , and will  take over min 75% of the market estimated to be over $2 billion in the USA alone. Their pipeline drug 9930 had a presentation with the FDA which resulted in the most remarkable outcome, where the drug (taken orally )blew the competition away(taken by injection and infusions), and the FDA gave BCRX the classification to go from phase 1 to phase3 immediately. That in itself is such a rare validation, very seldom given by The FDA. The drug  addresses 7 different very rare deceases, with a total of 
$ 60 Billions market. The present ps Is around $16.20. 
But if you do your D/D you will see articles that are so much more detailed in analyzing this remarkable company, so you would want to own shares . Together we can kill the SHORTS who has 22 million shares which they soon regret that they borrowed. Come aboard and be long on a stock which by analysis should be a $ 184 stock."

2021-06-06 08:46:56,wallstreetbets,Catching the peak on this is honestly more impressive than some of the gains I’ve seen on here... impressive
2021-06-05 23:47:47,wallstreetbets,Bruh...

2021-06-06 09:45:50,wallstreetbets,I got in at $18 thanks to my stupid opening limit buy. Should have waited until about 10 after the bell when it dropped by $4. Oh well. Still holding. Bags are checked. Waiting for takeoff. 🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-06-06 04:53:36,wallstreetbets,"At 24?  Dayum isn't that the absolute peak?

Dang brah.  I'm at $17 ish but I can promise you I wont sell at 24."
2021-06-06 07:31:36,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-06-06 09:36:54,wallstreetbets,"Was in around 16 or 17, bought that dip some months back to average down to about 10 now, don’t worry though, I really trust this stock. It will recover and I believe it will be close to 50 within the next year and a half. By 5 years it will be a 100 dollar stock. Hold."
2021-06-06 01:43:07,wallstreetbets,Did you wash sale or something to get that high?!
2021-06-06 03:56:53,wallstreetbets,jesus talk about buying at the top

2021-06-06 10:04:29,wallstreetbets,"Not as big as you guys but 101 at $18 lol
We will be in the green soon boys"
2021-06-06 10:30:56,wallstreetbets,Damn man did you average down at all when it was around 8-9 range?
2021-06-06 10:50:33,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I want to see that loss porn… it’ll make me feel better about my bb losses last week, Ape strong brother! We will recover next week!"
2021-06-06 10:54:32,wallstreetbets,Been holding at $13 since January
2021-06-06 10:58:27,wallstreetbets,Why didn’t you average cost your position during the dips?
2021-06-06 11:14:56,wallstreetbets,"Hang on, we’re coming"
2021-06-06 11:58:20,wallstreetbets,"Hahahhahahaha, Da fck."

2021-06-06 14:49:14,wallstreetbets,And I thought my 15 was bad. When did it even hit 24?
2021-06-06 16:17:20,wallstreetbets,I guess I'm going to buy just so I can catch up to $24. I like this stock 🚀🚀🚀🦍
2021-06-06 16:35:06,wallstreetbets,You don’t see foresee a crash from like $36 all the way to $10 which happened a few months ago?
2021-06-06 16:41:37,wallstreetbets,Dude 770 @ 24? You’re making me feel much better about my 400 at 19. BB to the moon.
2021-06-06 18:28:29,wallstreetbets,Damn... I didn't even know it hit $24 ever lol
2021-06-06 18:48:25,wallstreetbets,24!?!?! This dude wrote the book on diamond hands
2021-06-06 10:36:35,wallstreetbets,Why would you buy them at $24? Am I missing something? Wouldn’t it have been better to buy them now and wait till they got back to $24+? I bought at $18 because of this. Clarify if I’m wrong.
2021-06-06 01:06:58,wallstreetbets,Nice...
2021-06-06 06:45:40,wallstreetbets,19.50 baby!
2021-06-06 04:33:58,wallstreetbets,"I sold my amc at 18 per so I could get some cash together, after I got paid I bought back in at 69 per. Buy high sell low is the way this works right??"
2021-06-06 13:58:59,wallstreetbets,"Bold of you to think we will dip on Monday... BB open at $35, then thrusts to $350."
2021-06-06 17:50:45,wallstreetbets,I bought the dip at $15 Friday....but it kept dipping.
2021-06-06 12:10:39,wallstreetbets,Just bb shares i hope. No calls.
2021-06-06 01:34:22,wallstreetbets,Lol you guys are beyond retarded. BB is not going to the moon. Sorry if you guys disagree or lost money but BB is not the set up for a short squeeze
2021-06-06 10:15:56,wallstreetbets,I am up like 2 dollars lol. $13.65 is my number
2021-06-06 10:50:56,wallstreetbets,"I bought 450 shares last year at an avg price of 4.50. Then I bought another 75 earlier this year at 16. Current avg is around 6.50ish. Bought these for the long term, so I haven't sold a share. Not even to recoup my initial investment. My friends say i'm retarded. I just respond with ""thank you"""
2021-06-06 08:56:53,wallstreetbets,yes because we're all retarded apes. I bought at $16
2021-06-06 00:28:43,wallstreetbets,Holy shit
2021-06-06 02:30:19,wallstreetbets,Lol cmon... I'm reading the replies and not a single one has linked it to BB.
2021-06-06 02:07:09,wallstreetbets,"Yo, that shit tripped me out. I had to look it up. I don’t have Twitter."
2021-06-06 01:50:15,wallstreetbets,You're so right.  Everyone thought it was c um rocket but it's totally about Blackberry.   Good call man
2021-06-06 12:17:51,wallstreetbets,"It’s actually funny, owning a sizable chunk of Blackberry would be a massive hedge for him, so it’s sensible that he’d have some interest."
2021-06-06 11:01:52,wallstreetbets,Why would that have anything to do with blackberry?
2021-06-05 22:45:40,wallstreetbets,I'll take dibs on his husband.
2021-06-06 13:47:23,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I thought I was getting it square in the nuts at 16.57,  Reading this thread helps me feel a little better."

2021-06-06 02:40:50,wallstreetbets,"At $24 a share, all this shit is already priced in along with an added bonus for the revenue from the CEO's wife's boyfriend's sextape that's  going to be up for auction."
2021-06-06 08:57:41,wallstreetbets,Needed this today.

2021-06-06 02:36:02,wallstreetbets,"When beginning, invest only what you can afford to lose. Even if it’s as low as $50."
2021-06-06 02:35:34,wallstreetbets,"BB will grow, there's no doubt about it... BUT, it wont be a short term thing, if you are in need of money right now dont do it. If you just want money in the long term then FOR SURE buy this week, most likely this week will be the lowest BB will be for a while"
2021-06-06 01:33:00,wallstreetbets,Holy shit that is advanced autism
2021-06-06 11:17:07,wallstreetbets,"Mostly meme. It’s not shorted, it’s a $10b market cap stock competing in a market against competitors with $200b+ market cap, main strengths are its tech and cash flow."
2021-06-06 01:27:07,wallstreetbets,Infinite money glitch. BB will soon overtake Amazon
2021-06-06 11:46:20,wallstreetbets,BB is an enterprise security stock.  Will play a big role in protecting against ransomeware. https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/ransomware
2021-06-06 00:47:50,wallstreetbets,The media. Haha! 😂
2021-06-05 22:46:34,wallstreetbets,"Get in line, she is currently busy with her boyfriends."
2021-06-06 16:14:48,wallstreetbets,"Exactly! Please do your DD. AMC and GME are where you can expect mooning at this point. BB is just sympathetic movement at present I.e. if AMC/GME move up, BB moves up. In any case, the chances of BB mooning are very low. It is going to be a prolonged play, if it’s a play on its own at all. Even then, we’d need to wait for the Short sellers to get a greater interest in this stock. I don’t know if that’s going to happen anytime soon."
2021-06-06 12:43:37,wallstreetbets,it won't - literally bots + FOMO meant that people left AMC for BB but theres not enough people to push BB. AMC and Gamestop are the main plays still
2021-06-06 01:36:36,wallstreetbets,Walk the dog weirdo 😂
2021-06-06 00:11:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they are meme stocks & trash companies. 

BB actually has a decent product. The last meme stock to have a viable value proposition was Tesla.

AMC & GME are trash."
2021-06-06 08:58:19,wallstreetbets,GME and AMC are failing companies
2021-06-06 16:08:15,wallstreetbets,"I used to love Robinhood but as I’ve gone deeper into the trading rabbit hole, I find that it’s UI doesn’t allow for fast execution unlike some other desktop apps. This, combined with their shady practices, led me to the opinion that hat it’s way better to use a different app. I would’ve switched brokers earlier but didn’t want to stay on the sidelines during the squeeze on AMC and GME. After making some tendies on the AMC/GME boat, I plan to completely switch over."
2021-06-06 13:15:50,wallstreetbets,"You are one paranoid ape. I am not a bot and this is 100% real, I have been following for a while but I didn't post since there is nothing worthy."
2021-06-06 12:44:57,wallstreetbets,"this this this, too many people falling for the BB trap. You left AMC to push BB because of FOMO when we were not even done with AMAC!?!? So you BB people don't have enough people to push it"
2021-06-05 23:06:16,wallstreetbets,What's wrong with Robinhood? Seems like an easy place to start.
2021-06-05 23:20:29,wallstreetbets,Because fuck you that's why.
2021-06-05 23:24:38,wallstreetbets,what do you use?

I first bought a put thinking it would go down and then bought shares when I saw the insane volume last week.     

Hedged by accident."
2021-06-06 01:29:05,wallstreetbets,But stocks only go up?
2021-06-06 11:30:30,wallstreetbets,"AMC, GME, TLRY, BB was all down hard Friday so alot bailing out or HF selling shorts at super low asks to scare holders to sell out and drop meme stocks prices so they can cover."

AMC is nearly about to bust, if he is already taking a risk why should he jump ship for another meme stock. he should either hold or sell and not go into another shifty meme stock that has already gone 500% up in like a week"

2021-06-06 06:55:03,wallstreetbets,9/17  with a $43 strike on my covered calls. I win either way. Bought more shares with the premium.
2021-06-06 11:24:53,wallstreetbets,BB is primaraly a software security company nowdays for big industry/government.  Their free cash flow is unreal as they're making money without big expenditures.

2021-06-06 13:53:32,wallstreetbets,I basically spent all expendable income I had to buy some extra shares of AMC as it was pushing the 60s. Brought my average up to like 34 right before the price dropped for like two straight days
2021-06-06 00:54:53,wallstreetbets,I got in at 19.75 cad
2021-06-06 15:21:15,wallstreetbets,One thing I have learned let the cash burn off at the opening bell. Least a good 15-20 min. I use to set limit for the pre market and got burned everytime.
2021-06-06 12:24:03,wallstreetbets,Its went higher than 24 in jan.
2021-06-06 14:37:14,wallstreetbets,True dat. It will never get that high again.

2021-06-06 06:03:51,wallstreetbets,"Oh man, so let me tell you my story. 

I bought AMC @ $13 in 2019 for no reason. I saw the stock tanking in 2020 and bailed out. Then the GME/AMC thing happened. So I bought back in to AMC at $25 per. 

BUT THEN I had the genius idea to sell everything I had in Ameritrade and buy it again on WeBull. I had that idea on Tuesday. This past Tuesday. When everything skyrocketed. I sold my AMC shares, which were avg $25. I then realized like a noob that it took days to transfer into my bank account.

I freak. I moved my savings around and deposited hundreds of dollars into WeBull, but being new to WeBull, I didn't learn that I could buy stocks before the money fully transfers until THURSDAY.

I ended up buying back in at $45 a share. I still want to find a dark corner to cry in."
2021-06-06 19:03:33,wallstreetbets,🦍 no worries we going to 500k 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-06 14:01:07,wallstreetbets,If it's meant to be it's meant to be!! Hoping I can add more before the rocket lifts off

2021-06-06 01:52:18,wallstreetbets,Duh. A short squeeze won't make a trillion dollar meme-ket cap. BB is going to mars.
2021-06-06 01:37:32,wallstreetbets,Honestly BlackBerry was dead since 07-10’ We might as well start having people buy up JCPenney

WSB mods never allow posting from this type of accounts. Several of us have constantly our posts remove/deleted. Then, we go through the comments of those posts and its full of bots commenting. Besides you've been following for a while, and then you decided to jump in with 6000 shares @17?!? Damn, that was really a bad timing huh?? So much time following and decided to jump at the top... I know I'm being paranoid but we seen this before, and we seeing this again. A lot of us are carrying bags for falling for this before, hope everyone is aware this time. Good trades for all 🐒💎🙌🚀🌕"

People posting due diligence on those stocks on wall street bets get downvoted. Check out the specific stock subreddits and make an informed choice that way. 

All I know is I personally think all meme stocks are a distraction for the GameStop main event. I also think bb is heading back to $10. I also think alot of the short positions on amc have been covered and anyone still in there is likely going to be stuck holding the bag. There is only one MOASS.

And if you truly believe they all move together, why didn't you put 1/3 of that cash into each one?"

Revenues are in a heavy up-trend YOY, Extremely high revenue growth potential, profitable in the next 2-3 years, product diversification, and many more.

To me personally, the addition of Aphria was a great decision. Tilray is now a mega cannabis company. Aphria was the #1 cannabis company on the planet in terms of raw financial performance. These two powerhouse companies are going to lead the charge in medicinal cannabis.

Legislation appears to be in the favor of cannabis which will ultimately reverse this long term negative down-trend. With TLRY being the now industry leader, I believe they will benefit the most from favorable legislation.

&#x200B;

However, with all of those positive characteristics in mind, Tilray is being shorted to Shanghai. Why? Is it for the monetary gain of people who can afford to short companies?

&#x200B;

Short term: With investors tripling down on short bets as shown on Bloomberg, things could get interesting. I believe that retail is in control of this play. Can we get it back to 150$ where it belongs?"
2021-06-06 02:33:16,wallstreetbets,"Tilray is the stock that is Deep Fuckin Value. Best managed, survived short attack, climbed to the top of the Canadian market beating CGC, ACB, HEXO, and turned itself American (HQ in NY), now selling worldwide while waiting for America to legalize. TLRY is also heavily shorted and gets manipulated down. It's still deep down in the gutter. And it's been squeezed to a breaker at 300 before.

USA federal medical legalization will open the flood gates for this company and in the meantime they are expanding in Europe where countries are legalizing as we speak. Cannabis legalization and consumption around the world is increasing. It's the new beer AND cigarettes AND aspirin and TLRY is the world leader.

GME, AMC, TLRY: Goes together like video games, movie theaters and weed."

I know why I’m invested in both. I did my dd. Since even Amazon is interested in the MJ sector and US legalization is making progress, this makes me bullish. Why should a big fat company like Amazon care about a sector, of there is no chance to make money with it - right, they wouldn’t even think about it. Till end of the year we should see a lot of acquisitions/ fusions. I believe that Tilray could actually hit at least 150$ if not higher. Till end of the year, of course. I bet on a similar chart pattern as AMC.  Sundial and Tilray look similar in regard of the chart pattern.

TLRY: 12.5€ average, SNDL: 0.855€ average,

In general, large companies such as TLRY have a far easier time getting business, especially in a new region, because they have a track record of being able to deliver product. They have a proven supply chain and have handled international business previously. Smaller companies will also surge but the reality is the impact they will have in the near term is negligible IMO. It will take them time to get spun up once legalization happens. 


I'm holding a number of shares of a small pot company ticker LVVV. They have been slow to gain business, partially due to the complex legal status of the product. I imagine most small US companies are under similar circumstances."

They already have distribution and wholesale ironed out at a national and international supply level. They can sell it medically online and ship it same day.

But TLRY - not only did it have a short squeezing action before but also a meme stock and MUCH MORE WIDELY KNOWN. So it was a fantastic decision to keep the name TLRY. 

BUt this merger was soooo perfect. Aphria’s low production costs and LOTS of facilities to operate with  AND tlry’s diversity in the states and it’s good reputation in the states was a perfect fit"
2021-06-06 02:12:18,wallstreetbets,This is where I’m conflicted my gut is telling to get tilray but I look at sundial and I see it has so much potential too and it’s cheaper. Should I invest in both or just tilray because it has more potential? Such a battle for me lol

Anyone else think there's going to be bullish sentiment growing in regards to the CCP? How retarded is it to buy puts on a tripple leveraged inverse ETF? Seems like this is due for more movement and options are still pretty cheap. Also seeing a lot of hostilities toward Taiwan. Anyone else feeling this vibe?

The largest country in the world, that the US economy is basically 100 percent reliant on at this point, may have been the cause of a pandemic. Why do you think this will influence Chinese stocks even if proven to be true? Do you honestly think anything’s going to happen to China even if it is true? You think we’re gonna sink our own economy to punish them? I’m not trying to be an asshole. I’m just actually curious what the thought process is here."

The number of defaults on loans in small and mid size companies has been ramping up the last couple of months, and there's around $1.2T in short term debt coming due between now and this time next year. Winnie the Pooh has been making a point of letting a lot of these companies default as well to reduce moral hazard, in contrast to historically policies where the central bank of China would prop them up."

2021-06-05 21:57:21,wallstreetbets,Basically if the Wuhan lab leak theory is true then the US and allies will have no choice but to retaliate in some way. Now the magnitude of that retaliation? Who knows could be benign but if it coincides with CCP hostility towards taiwan you could see  a huge pressure for boycotts/sanctions/more. Couple that with Chinese hostility towards Americans ( I am hearing a lot of mainlanders say the virus orginated in the US) and you don't have a recipe for success. There's also grumbling that China will need to devalue its currency to continue the ability to maintain cheap manufacturing. I was very surprised at how no one seemed to care about Hong Kong but I feel sentiment will shift when Taiwan is attacked. People didnt really understand the nuance between Hong Kong and the CCP but I feel like most understand Taiwan is its own country
2021-06-06 19:20:07,wallstreetbets,You don't have to sink the US economy to punish China. Trump's tariffs cost them billions which they ate by devaluing their currency. Wall Street said the sky would fall which was bullshit.

2021-06-06 19:02:25,wallstreetbets,"Why would the fed need to bail out China? They have their own yuan printer to go brrrrrr to bail themselves out.The more they print, the more Americans can buy from them with strong USD for devalued yuan.

If the yuan doesn't devalue against USD then the fed is screwed because that means CPI inflation, which means having to raise rates, which means US stock market and housing crash, which means a US pension and municipal bankruptcy crisis. Not an option. 

Better to let the Chinese devalue their currency and continue letting them import the USA's CPI inflation."

2021-06-05 22:42:22,wallstreetbets,"If you're talking about Taiwan as it's own country your understanding of the situation is way too rudimentary.

The majority of Taiwanese don't want to be subject to CCP, but they don't consider themselves to be another country and aren't looking for that.  Mainland posturing is directed more at the US than Taiwanese - both sides see this as a dispute that's best settled in the family, not in the view of outsiders.

The Chinese government is also unlikely to allow any significant currency devaluation as would drive some massive inflation, and that's going to undermine political stability - look at drivers of the Tiananmen square protests - this type of inflation was a significant factor. If you think the CCP isn't painfully aware of this, you're way off base.

The Chinese government is no longer interested in selling tube socks to the world. They want to take over high quality, high tech manufacturing - remember Swiss watchmaking once was the cheap, second tier ""made in China"" label to watches made in England and France. China wants to follow that Swiss model of dominating manufacturing and so far is doing an amazing job of it.

If Covid escaped from a lab in Wuhan, the discussion will be centered on safeguarding all such labs world wide, or any discussion will be shut down pretty quick."
2021-06-06 01:40:24,wallstreetbets,"China and the US are tied to each other economically. The US may onshore manufacturing, but that will take years to roll out. The CCP has direct control over their economy, so they give more funding to state industries in strategic sectors, allowing Chinese manufacturers to sell products near the cost of production. That could precipitate the US responding, but that’s another long-term idea with indefinite time duration and catalysts. The response from the US could just be to do the same thing as China (prop up strategic industries) rather than escalate tensions with China. I think you need to formulate a more narrow hypothesis if you’re going to do an options trade."
2021-06-05 21:49:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it is. If you do puts you're going to need to guess on an open ended time frame on issues of geo-politics. That shit can be slow boil, and half of it can be intentional misdirects and posturing just to prevent the very thing you're trying to bet on. So yeah, you could go long on YANG, since it appears to already be built as an inverse bet on China large caps."

2021-06-05 22:01:45,wallstreetbets,Feel like we've been at a slow boil for the last two years.

Ten years ago the US still maintained a policy of being 40 years ahead of any other nation in relation to space technology. China blew that up pretty quick.

Your article I agree is meaningful in relation to business investment and how much money will be wasted, but it views investment in technology as a wyle e coyote scheme to catch the Roadrunner- abandoned completely when it fails, not something that can be built upon. China has grad students in any worthwhile graduate program in any worthwhile university in the world. I've known a few. They're no joke and the go home and earn the big bucks doing world class work."
