2021-05-01 19:58:14,stocks,So ur saying we git 4600 before the larger correction which will bring us to lower levels than current?
2021-05-01 19:27:23,stocks,"An S&P 500 fund is essentially a managed fund. Stocks are added and removed multiple times a year, like you said, by a committee. It's not an algorithm that chooses the stocks, it's a group of humans.

The S&P 500, by its nature, will ""buy high"" and ""sell low"" because a company already needs to be successful to be added to the index and they remove unsuccessful companies.

There was a study a while ago that found that if you invested in the original list of companies in the S&P 500 and didn't follow the index,  you'd outperform the index by a wide margin. That's because the index has a history of removing companies while they're down and later adding them back when they recover. If you simply held on to the companies, you'd have done better. And that even accounts for the fact that many of the original companies no longer exist.

The index was meant to track the state of the market, not provide the best returns. The fact that it's now a major investment is something the original designers of the index never intended."
2021-05-01 19:11:09,stocks,It is all based on extrapolation of past performance and the assumption those trends will continue at Infinitum. Google “historical returns S&P500” and you will see the overall trend.
2021-05-01 19:22:42,stocks,"There's worries about inflation, plus stagnation in some sectors such as tech, especially after seeing the massive run up the past year. Add increasing taxes, higher interest rates, and a slow down in growth from the large dominating companies and you could conservatively say 5% growth.   


Historically the S&P500 grows about 10% a year, but after the latest massive bull run we could see it slow down for the next few years. Having meme companies like Tesla with Forward P/E's of 100 won't last forever. I personally always plan on about 7% growth rate."
2021-05-01 19:05:56,stocks,Great question and I’ve been wondering the same. Following. I have VFIAX and love it and always figured it would be with me until retirement. But I thought the same way about my bonds too lol
2021-05-01 19:55:43,stocks,"So would it be better to invest in “equal weight” index funds? These are somewhat new concepts, to invest in equal weight rather than market weight. Theoretically, you wouldn’t be buying more into expensive stocks that’s already run up."
2021-05-01 19:52:19,stocks,Damn bro your fucked
2021-05-01 19:19:25,stocks,"The answer is yes. [Here's the link from the NYSE website itself.](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/trading-info) Scroll down to the Limit Up/Limit Down section.

""On May 31, 2012, the SEC approved, on a pilot basis, a National Market System Plan, known as the Limit Up/Limit Down (""LULD"") Plan, to address extraordinary market volatility.

The Plan is designed to prevent trades in NMS Stocks from occurring outside specified price bands, which are set at a percentage level above and below the average reference price of a security over the preceding five-minute period. The percentage level is determined by a security’s designation as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 security. Tier 1 comprises all securities in the S&P 500, the Russell 1000 and select Exchange Traded Products (ETPs). Tier 2 comprises all other NMS securities, except for rights and warrants, which are specifically excluded from coverage. The Plan applies during regular trading hours of 9:30 am ET - 4:00 pm ET.""

[Here's the actual plan and how it works. ](https://www.luldplan.com/) It was permantently approved on April 11, 2019.

Trading halts by the exchanges directly are quite common. [Here you can find the halt history.](https://www.nyse.com/trade-halt-historical)"
2021-05-01 19:00:50,stocks,It's called halted on circuit breaker. There's a website that lists the halts hourly
2021-05-01 18:46:37,stocks,Yes they can do that and more lots of games can be played look at GME for all examples of how they can bend you over and teach you who is boss
2021-05-01 19:06:27,stocks,"Suspending is like shaking the hive, gets everyone angry and pumped, then when they let it go again it rips again. I for one like violent rips and dips, it's exciting! Seeing AMC & GME Suspended is what I've been waiting for, a confirmation that the squeeze is on!"
2021-05-01 19:46:49,stocks,"Very much appreciated. I’m going to dig through that. 
We all know what happened with GME. I’m super interested in how a suspension would affect momentum in contrast to halts. Obviously with the phenomenon happening now, I’d be surprised if any previous examples in trading history could predict what would happen if say GME or AMC ran again. would people froth at the mouth, or would it collapse again. A 10 day suspension (or any number of days) is a very different animal."
2021-05-01 18:45:43,stocks,"Wouldn't it be more like 22% on the 30k and 10% on the 50k? 

Your total income is 80k, but your long term capital gains were 50k."
2021-05-01 18:51:37,stocks,"You might be right, that's what I'm tryna understand how it all works"
2021-05-01 18:59:37,stocks,Yeah income tax and capital gains tax are usually different as are your tax free income allowance vs capital gains allowance.
2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Why hasn't Robinhood still not received any form of punishment/fine when they restricted the buying on 50 different stocks back in January? This article contains the list: https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html

I know other brokerages restricted GME/AMC. But Robinhood's restricted list was way bigger and included stocks such as AMD, AAL, BYND, GM, IPOE, MRNA, and SBUX. I had got into stocks in January 2021 as a new years resolution. Which was a couple weeks before the GME stuff and reddit trading was even all over the news. At the time I honestly thought the buying restriction was something a part of the stock market. As a few stocks had been getting suspended in trading in both buying/selling quite frequently prior to RH restrictions. 

Now that a couple months have passed looking back. Im honestly shocked RH didn't receive any type of fine/punishment for that. They limited the upside on 50 stocks while still leaving holders open to the full downside. I really hope that doesn't happen again."
2021-05-01 11:34:14,stocks,You really hope it doesn’t happen again?? Lol why are you still using Robinhood? They failed again just a week ago during the dog e bull run. People tried to sell and they weren’t allowed. It takes 20 minutes to transfer to Fidelity or Vanguard.
2021-05-01 09:41:17,stocks,Because the SEC has no balls.
2021-05-01 12:10:06,stocks,Why is it only robinhood ever mentioned when it was 13 brokerages?
2021-05-01 10:25:05,stocks,Because having a RH account isn't the same as unfettered market access.
2021-05-01 11:00:54,stocks,"I thought this whole restriction thing was suspicious too but after hearing from some people in personal conversations who work in clearance houses, the fact of the matter was that they couldn’t process the amount of transactions happening. After the first wave of GME, they said they set up servers (I think that’s the word) specifically for GME. Not to mention, Robinhood literally didn’t have the capital to process the buy orders. They had to raise like a couple billion over night because they literally couldn’t process what was going on. The market just wasn’t ready for the influx of retail investors at the time. If it was, I think the stock could have gone up to much higher amounts."
2021-05-01 10:00:54,stocks,Because it ultimately isn't illegal for a broker to choose which securities it wants to offer
2021-05-01 10:56:25,stocks,"I'm not actually sure they violated any regulations.  I don't think there is any regulated requirement to offer everything to everyone at all times, unless clearly done for corrupt or unreasonable reasons.

The ""punishment"" they should get is users fleeing their platform en masse."
2021-05-01 10:13:25,stocks,Because it wasn't illegal.
2021-05-01 16:07:50,stocks,"How about because when you signed up for robinhood or any other broker it explicitly says we have the right to stop trading and liquidate your positions at anytime, how about that? Lol, did you not read your trading agreement?"
2021-05-01 10:31:07,stocks,"Because you agreed to let them do it with the user agreement.
 
  ""I understand Robinhood may at any time, in its sole discretion
and without prior notice to Me, prohibit or restrict My ability to trade securities."""
2021-05-01 10:46:21,stocks,TOS. Wasn't it a liquidity issue anyways? You don't want to be restricted find more solvent brokerages
2021-05-01 09:37:46,stocks,bc they are owned by some very big money
2021-05-01 10:42:40,stocks,"> Now that a couple months have passed looking back. Im honestly shocked RH didn't receive any type of fine/punishment for that.

Because they didn't do anything wrong or illegal? All brokerages put in trade restrictions, they do it frequently, and it's been happening long before the GME thing.

Just because a brokerage allows trading stocks, that doesn't mean they are required to allow completely unrestricted trading of all stocks.

> I really hope that doesn't happen again.

So don't use RobinHood?"
2021-05-01 10:37:40,stocks,Easy answer... Because they didn't do anything against regulations.
2021-05-01 10:42:44,stocks,Because what they did was legal.
2021-05-01 14:08:28,stocks,"Because the reason they gave, namely having to honour margin requirements with the DTCC, is a pretty good one. This is not some optional thing - if they hadn't been able to post appropriate margins they would have breached multiple regulations.

I know that's not going to convince the GME diehards, and of course I can't be sure there wasn't something else at play. In any case, it would take time to get to the bottom of it even if there was foul play, even for the SEC. They're not wizards and have to deal with a shitload of data in cases like these."
2021-05-01 12:37:32,stocks,"When you're wondering why the world didn't end even though you and the gang were really sure about it, you might be in a cult."
2021-05-01 10:15:39,stocks,Because you are using their product in which you agreed to their TOS.
2021-05-01 09:54:24,stocks,"Why would they be punished? Everyone using robinhood agreed to let them do this when they accepted their terms. 

You had people saying that without them doing what they did the entire market would have collapsed, that's obviously bullshit but that is what the story is and they are sticking to it. Nothing will happen besides maybe robinhood updates their terms so they don't get classactioned by shit like this again in the future."
2021-05-01 11:42:08,stocks,They did nothing wrong is why. If they didn't have the capital then they didn't have it. Refusing to allow people to close positions on the other hand would have been way worse. Stopping people from opening new positions is no issue.
2021-05-01 11:13:43,stocks,"Punish them for what? RH didn’t have a choice. They had to comply with federal regulations after r/wsb intentionally tried to force a liquidity crisis.

The conspiracy theorists in r/wsb and r/stocks ruin actual content."
2021-05-01 11:37:54,stocks,"Because Robinhood didn’t have the money to cover all of the transactions it was processing, so it had to restrict trading until it attracted new investment."
2021-05-01 11:59:52,stocks,Why would they?  Robinhood has been restricting high volatility stocks since they first opened this isn’t something new nor is it against any law.
2021-05-01 11:07:35,stocks,Because it wasn’t illegal? How is this confusing people.
2021-05-01 10:23:02,stocks,Because it's not illegal
2021-05-01 10:51:21,stocks,"Because they did nothing wrong.

They restricted trades either because the market halted trading in those tickets or because those tickers had collateral requirements for those trades at the clearinghouse that Robinhood could not meet.

And even without justification, the account agreement that every client agreed to when the opened their account have Robinhood unilateral authority to refuse to complete those trades."
2021-05-01 10:06:31,stocks,We're still pretending Robinhood was the brokerage that did this?
2021-05-01 10:27:42,stocks,Because even if what they did hurt investors if they didn’t do it they would have been margin called and every investor would have had their positions liquidated and received zero dollars. So you tell me which is better.
2021-05-01 09:41:46,stocks,Because the people in charge of holding them accountable are profiting from all of the shady shit MM's do and most voters are too ignorant and stupid to figure it out.
2021-05-01 10:10:24,stocks,"Because users agreed to the bs terms of service and no laws were broken.

[Morpheus voice] welcome, to the Real World."
2021-05-01 11:05:30,stocks,I think there was a run on their finances and they faced and existential crisis. They didn’t have the money to cover the orders so they had to limit the most traded stocks (or the ones with the most collateral needed). I’m not sure this is against the law nor am I sure they should be fined for it.
2021-05-01 12:08:21,stocks,"Read the fine print, they are allowed to do that. Same thing with all the other companies that did the same thing"
2021-05-01 12:19:35,stocks,"TECHNICALLY it says in the fine print of the EULA that they can restrict trading if it's in the best interest of their customers

or some bs like that"
2021-05-01 12:20:55,stocks,Because there won’t be any punishment. What they did was legal.
2021-05-01 13:37:38,stocks,"Because they got margin called, it's not exactly illegal."
2021-05-01 13:38:57,stocks,Because it wasn't illegal. They are not obligated to give access to buy all stocks at any time. And the restrictions were because they weren't sure they had the money to settle all the buys.
2021-05-01 16:20:54,stocks,I have them the only punishment I could. I cancelled my account. And if we all do that they’ll go out of business
2021-05-01 16:27:41,stocks,Rules for thee not for me
2021-05-01 16:54:37,stocks,Because rich people that make other rich people even more rich don’t go to prison.
2021-05-01 17:22:13,stocks,"Honestly, if you are still using Robbinghood at this point with how they have handled things, it’s on you to some extent!"
2021-05-01 17:44:13,stocks,Please don't use Robinhood.
2021-05-01 18:49:22,stocks,"It will not change. This is one of those systems so entrenched in the world that it’s easier to move on than hope for a change that will never come. 

Begin transition into crypto, they have candy."
2021-05-01 18:58:46,stocks,"They did, I deleted my account and pulled all of my money off their platform. As should everyone else!"
2021-05-01 19:13:55,stocks,Why? Because people don't stop using it. It's a business made to rake in billions annually. Which is partnered with Citadel. Anything in that region of invesment world is blind side of SEC.
2021-05-01 19:15:40,stocks,The real question is WTF is anyone still using RH?
2021-05-01 19:16:42,stocks,"It's so they can do it again the next time, and again, and again."
2021-05-01 10:18:48,stocks,Because didn’t every other brokerage did the same thing ? Robinhood just got most of the flack because of how popular it is to retail traders
2021-05-01 15:46:25,stocks,TLDR multiple exchanges did this as they were restricted by clearing house requirements. It's not illegal. You guys can bitch about this everyday on reddit and blame RH but the real problem is the SEC rules and clearing house requirements. I have a two other brokerage accounts and they were restricted as well during that time.
2021-05-01 15:54:37,stocks,Cause the world is unfair. You move on.
2021-05-01 10:15:53,stocks,literally all brokerage will restrict you is some way shape or form by using buy limits ect. I literally tried every single one and they all get away with bs.
2021-05-01 15:17:01,stocks,Because you agreed to let them do that in the terms of service to use Robinhood in the first place
2021-05-01 10:26:42,stocks,[deleted]
2021-05-01 11:07:38,stocks,"Because it was the regulators, the DTCC, that forced Robin Hood to take that action. Overnight, the DTCC increased the capital requirements from something like 10% to over 100%. Robinhood did not have the 5 billion in cash to meet that sudden and unexpected requirement.

I don't mean to defend Robin Hood here, I think they are terrible, but if you want to know who really manipulated the markets here, look to the regulators - the DTCC."
2021-05-01 11:08:51,stocks,Because restricting buying is not illegal or against any regulations
2021-05-01 11:36:11,stocks,"They should have seen it coming and not come so close to a margin call, yeah. But this childish understanding of what happened is so annoying. They didn’t want to halt trading and create the biggest PR disaster since the BP oil spill. They failed to prepare or message about it appropriately. It was either halt increasing the position size in the volatile stocks (which would require even more cash on hand) or have ‘technical difficulties’ and bring the entire platform down, like I kind of suspected they did during the pandemic crash volatility days. (Also like other firms did on gme volatility day? Idk but it is curious that platforms always go down on high volatility days. They say it is volume.)

The big failure was they pulled in extra cash to shore up maintenance for the volatility spike way too late. This wasn’t a conspiracy to fuck customers, like the hordes of brand new ~~investors~~ cultists think. It was a failure to see what was happening and a mismanaged PR disaster. The bigger question is why hasn’t vlad’s head rolled yet? I suppose there’s nobody to replace him at this stage. But this shit has cost the venture investors insane money and seriously damaged the business and altered the ipo plan. Vlad needs to realize he’s toxic now and bring in some pro PR people. He could learn from it and try to recover or just be less visible from now on, but instead he’s doing podcasts. Good luck with that Vlad, people will just poach it for more fuck up sound bytes, while they willfully refuse to understand what happened and smear shit on their faces while crying about holding amc and gme until they reach some magical number where they become the richest people in the world. Lol I wish I could bottle the delusion and save it for terminally ill people in pain."
2021-05-01 11:46:17,stocks,Because they did nothing wrong lol
2021-05-01 15:18:26,stocks,"Because they had a legitimate reason,or legitimate enough for the regulators. In my opinion, it made sense and it certainly was not for the reasons people thought it was originally."
2021-05-01 15:46:21,stocks,"Because they did nothing illegal, and everyone hates you GME apes"
2021-05-01 16:06:04,stocks,"Because they still, despite what the econ PHD wannabes on reddit may want you to believe, didn't do anything illegal, or even morally wrong.

[This](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/) is one of about a thousand write-ups that you can read to find out more. I know that redditors *reeeeaaaaally* need a bad guy to blame after GME didn't go to 10k+ like promised, but unfortunately the reality is that noone really did anything abhorent, or wrong and the SEC can't punish people that didn't break any rules."
2021-05-01 17:02:56,stocks,Because our government is bought and paid by these people

2021-05-01 16:30:41,stocks,Retail investors using RH is straight up shooting yourself in the foot.
2021-05-01 09:50:02,stocks,What the 3 previous people said.
2021-05-01 10:00:05,stocks,"Because it may not have been RH's decision and we have a bigger fish to fry named the DTCC a private entity that basically owns the entire market, and is an organization comprised of all the big banks and whales that play ball with them...

2021-05-01 10:27:39,stocks,"Hopefully people will learn from this and close their robinhood accounts, that all us 99% can do. A handful of people in the country control what happens to the other 350 million unlucky souls"
2021-05-01 10:38:51,stocks,"They offer a service and a ""product"", I'm sure somewhere in the user agreement that it mentions they may change availability of their product shelf.

2021-05-01 10:42:00,stocks,check their terms and conditions. we all signed up for their bullshit
2021-05-01 10:57:44,stocks,they are getting hit with hella lawsuits left and right rn. the justice system can be slow so there might be some repercussion down the road but we’ll have to wait and see.

All I know is that I had about 6 grand sitting in savings and RH made it so easy to invest that it's now $7,600 and I started in March. 

Also, they borrowed a billion. Doesn't that incontrovertibly prove their point about having a liquidity issue? [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/robinhood-fundraising.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/robinhood-fundraising.html)"

Their duty is to their customers and they did it as their only choice, though it outraged everyone. More outraging would be all client assets on margin frozen. They should have had more reserve capital in the first place with how their clients trade but didn’t and it was their only choice."

2021-05-01 13:27:06,stocks,"Their excuse was that they didnt lock down selling because locking people into potentially failing positions was worse.

Then, they went and locked selling when Doge ran up.

Remember, it took years for them to get fined for the payment for order flow non-disclosure and their order routing that cost traders money.

It will likely take years for these recent actions to make their way through the process.  Just like it will take years to settle the lawsuits they're going to have to fight.

Robinhood is a broker entity and they don't have the depth of financial backing to handle large volatility swings when their user base all decides to run in a particular direction.

Best thing is to move to a broker that has thr financial capacity to handle both volatility, but can dependably execute your orders.  Fidelity is getting popular and I'm on TD Ameritrade (though... May be switching to Fidelity soon).

Brokers like webull are in the same boat and Robinhood is not alone in the restricting of trading at the time.  TD Ameritrade never restricted the purchasing or sales of shares, but they did require 100% margin if you were on a margin account (not abnormal) and they restricting options trading.

The positive about Webull is they were quick to be honest and state the clearing house was the restriction and that they needed to come up with the deposit requirements before they could re-enable teading.  Robinhood tried to deny they had liquidity issues and they weren't honest about WHY they did what they did.

The deeper issue is how they handled their margin calls.  Because that's what it is when the clearing house says ""Hey, deposit more money to cover your risk!"".   I think that instant liquidation by the clearing houses would have led to much much larger squeezes and a domino effect in the market.  Essentially, Robinhood was the scapegoat because it had the highest number of retail traders and they tries to make the narrative about retail traders being the bad guys.

The issue is a lot deeper than Robinhood and goes down to the issue with short sales, share lending and fails to deliver.  Robinhood is just the first layer of the onion."

2021-05-01 13:39:37,stocks,"Robinhood, along with Schwab/TDA and other small brokerages were forced into a liquidity crisis.

They literally had no other choice."
2021-05-01 13:41:06,stocks,"Because what they did, despite it being a very dirty move, is allowed. Each broker has their own rules and terms they follow, but also rules and terms they need to follow outside of that. If a broker fears his position, he has to act. And even worse, if the clearing house fears his position because of a broker, then you can't even choose. The broker pays a collateral fee when an order goes through, it's a small % amount of the share price. Now the clearing house sits on the expense of buying the share off of someone who sold until the other side comes in and takes over, usually market makers. This lasts usually 2 days until a trade is settled, where both sell and buy went through a circle and the collateral fee is payed back. So just as a fun fact, the moment you sell and buy on a broker you don't actually own/lost the share yet. Though then again for most brokers they are the owners either way.

So when the clearing house(s) decided that they might not be able to deal with the GME rotating itself into an endless upwards trend, they wanted the broker to pay 100% or even more for these transactions to make sure that the clearing house can still keep going. If a broker fucks up, the worst that can happen is that the broker can't keep going. If a clearing house fucks up, several brokers can't do anything anymore, since a clearing house usually does the clearing for several broker.

Important: I am not claiming what happened was right. I think a lot of dirty things happened on the way, along with threats that lead to this. But since the upper part is a valid defense nothing will come out of this.

I think the main selling point for Fidelity was that they own Trillions on thei balance sheet BUT they are their own clearing house, that's why this story was different."

2021-05-01 13:54:25,stocks,Their punishment was losing every customer
2021-05-01 13:57:10,stocks,"My understanding is that it was an issue of liquidity with RH.  Robin Hood defaults most transactions to margin, unless you opt out (that's how you have immediate access to buy now even though a transfer takes 1-3 days; RH loaned you money to buy now).

With the massive influx of users who were not aware they were buying on margin, combined with massive volatility, RH ran afoul of liquidity requirements and had to stop trading to address that issue. 

But because the RH CEO is a liar and because they were hyping an upcoming  IPO, they didn't want to admit that they - Robin Hood - didn't have enough money to cover what they were doing. That would kill the stock. So they blamed everything and everyone else.

You didn't see that from Fidelity and Vanguard because they are exponentially larger and do not have the same liquidity issues. Even the smaller major players like Etrade, TD Ameritrade, etc. saw pauses in trading, albeit for much shorter periods.

The SEC DID do something - they told RH that they didn't have enough capital to continue and they needed to halt trading. It's counterintuitive,  but the SEC was protecting both investors and the broker in this case. But, they also harmed investors at the same time; by halting RH from trading, clients could not  open advantageous positions or close disadvantageous ones.

Now, the SEC should absolutely be doing something about hidden naked shorts and phantom shares being sold, but that is a different issue, though it involves some of the same securities. 

When I read about the liquidity issues and then Vlad 's responses, I moved everything from RH. I consolidated my holdings over to Etrade, and will probably move some or all to the Big Two. Fuck Robin Hood."

As to the legality of that clause, well, I’ll once again try to explain to the best of my knowledge.

Brokerages are ultimately private businesses and as such they retain the right to sell or not sell whatever stock they choose at any given time. This is not considered market manipulation.

So, let’s look at the contract itself: What would make this illegal (edit: invalid, not necessarily illegal)?

There’s capacity, mutual assent (it’s your job to read the tos), agreement, and so forth. It isn’t unconscionable as you can simply choose not to trade with them.


Anyway, so as shitty as what they did was there’s basically very little legal recourse from what I can see, though I’m not a lawyer."
2021-05-01 16:13:34,stocks,"Vlad is from Bulgaria ok 😂 any questions will be answered with, I am from Bulgaria"
2021-05-01 16:19:48,stocks,I believe there’s a clause in the terms agreement allowing Robin hood to restrict buying/selling this covers their ass from any sort of legal action
2021-05-01 16:21:31,stocks,"Even if they messed up, you can’t just stand up the next day and crush a company, it’s owners, it’s staff, it’s inventors. Let the system do it’s thing, if someone/government is pissed off enough they will go after Robinhood."
2021-05-01 16:24:52,stocks,It already happened again. They restricted trading of Dogecoin at peak.
2021-05-01 16:31:18,stocks,Market makers make the market - that’s why.
2021-05-01 16:43:58,stocks,"Because the only answer they get is ""when I was a young kid in Bulgaria"""
2021-05-01 17:03:53,stocks,"Because they are robinhood, they steal from the poor and give to the rich"
2021-05-01 17:14:14,stocks,Fuck robinhood
2021-05-01 17:15:03,stocks,There was some class action lawsuits circulating.  Not sure what came of them.
2021-05-01 17:16:07,stocks,They should all be in jail..
2021-05-01 17:17:30,stocks,"Same. 2007, now over 50%."
2021-05-01 17:18:03,stocks,"Because it was legal. In their terms of service or whatever it states they have the right to halt or limit trading on certain volatile securities. Fucking dirty, unfair bullshit. But, legal bullshit nonetheless. Robinhood is a bad company with worse ethics. They almost went bankrupt. So they turned their losses onto their customers instead. Raised billions of dollars from investors to keep themselves afloat whilst sinking their consumers funds by not letting them buy or sell certain stocks. Technically they did nothing wrong though. It’s a shame how the stock market works. Everything is in favor of the big man."
2021-05-01 17:22:22,stocks,b/c liquidity provisions and restrictions set by the SEC forced them to restrict buying.
2021-05-01 17:25:47,stocks,">What’s next, January River?"
2021-05-01 17:27:15,stocks,The punishment needs to come from the users...take control!
2021-05-01 17:29:42,stocks,We fine them by going somewhere else.
2021-05-01 17:35:12,stocks,"Who the fuck is still using Robinhood? Seriously, that's the only punishment they're going to get is mass exodus."
2021-05-01 17:36:50,stocks,Doesn’t it state in their user agreement they can do this? That’s why you don’t use robinhood.
2021-05-01 17:39:31,stocks,Why wasn't anyone in Wall Street held responsible for the dumpster fire fuckbfest of 2008 when the housing market collapsed? Because the government doesn't go after crimes involved wall street Because they are probably taking donations from them
2021-05-01 17:40:44,stocks,Because they didn’t technically break any laws
2021-05-01 17:41:36,stocks,"because it’s free to use lmao. When huge runs that like happen, firms need to balance there books and adjust to order flow. It’s so easy to use other platforms that have consistently worked, why are you even still using robin hood lol."
2021-05-01 17:41:49,stocks,"Because the DTC increased collateral requirements. How RH handled that internally was at their discretion.

The DTC gave RH a legal way out to restrict trade without legal repurcussion. RH acted accordingly.

The problem is that most brokers withheld trading and institutions were able to continue trading and reposition.

Retail was robbed thousands per share per the chair of IBKR.  Retail got fucked and got left bag holding. 

If there was a systemic issue of collapsing the market, the SEC should have halted trading for everyone while brokers addressed their liquidity issues."
2021-05-01 17:44:34,stocks,Everytime I try to transfer cash they cancel my transaction. My account has been restricted for the longest and I don't know why . I'm afraid of trying to transfer  my stocks to td because I think they will sell my shares and try to transfer the cash or just not do it at all..
2021-05-01 17:47:26,stocks,"Because the SEC is a fucking joke... Imagine this, the SEC will fine you 250,000 for a crime you commit that you can make millions from. Why would you not commit that crime if your only punishment is to be fined for a fraction of the loot you made which you would have never been able to acquire without committing said crime? The moral of the story is that the SEC is only in place to punish POOR people who fuck up and actually get hurt by these fines. Whereas brokerages, hedge funds, etc barely even blink from the same fines. The SEC is just the gatekeeper for rich people. Letting the rich get richer by screwing the little guy and at the same time keeping the poor out of the promised land."
2021-05-01 17:51:12,stocks,"Seems unlikely they broke any laws, only ethical issues.  A business can determine the products it sells usually"
2021-05-01 17:59:52,stocks,Où as-tu trouvé ton 50%?
2021-05-01 18:00:53,stocks,They are facing several law suits that will take years to be resolved. Last I heard someone said a rep from Fidelity said 1.5 million people have switched from RH. I’m one
2021-05-01 18:01:34,stocks,Because they phrased it in the form of a double negative. Two wrongs make a right.
2021-05-01 18:06:08,stocks,"I know nothing about stocks but I know how people operate and it's probably because they are a company that has other companies and/or very wealthy people providing them protection perhaps because someone very big that we would all know of made a phone call to Mitch McConnell or another high ranking douchbag and they got off the hook by the end of the 2 min call. 

Old money and big money gets ultimate protection...but there's a storm on the horizon for them and some things that have been going on right here in our Reddit are involved in this so I'm enjoying the show! This is gonna sound strange but I thank Donald Trump! He ruined the GOP to the point where people are literally fleeing a burning building right now that was once the GOP and the protection that Satan Mitch provided for so long is all of a sudden in question and flat out leaking!!!"
2021-05-01 18:08:58,stocks,Cancel Roberyhood!
2021-05-01 18:09:19,stocks,Probably cause everyone signed the user agreement. 🤷‍♂️
2021-05-01 18:09:42,stocks,They never will. It's called bribing the right people.
2021-05-01 18:11:05,stocks,Because our legal and economic and political institutions are designed to protect and expand the power of the owning class. The law literally is not applied to those who serve the interests of power.
2021-05-01 18:32:16,stocks,I don't understand.  I thought you guys traded stocks knowing that it's a rigged system but tried your little hearts out anyway?
2021-05-01 18:41:30,stocks,It’s like asking the police to investigate police misconduct
2021-05-01 18:44:02,stocks,"Because of the Golden Rule... he who has the gold, makes the rules."
2021-05-01 18:46:55,stocks,TOS agreement
2021-05-01 18:48:19,stocks,Because the law can wait if you pay enough in the States.
2021-05-01 18:49:14,stocks,Does nobody use webull? Free crypto trading and they just added doge
2021-05-01 18:49:36,stocks,Nothing is going to do just fine.
2021-05-01 18:50:14,stocks,I saw an attourney saying they can do this cause it's in their tos
2021-05-01 18:53:35,stocks,"It already happened again recently, they didn't allow people to sell their doge coins at the peak"
2021-05-01 19:06:22,stocks,"if the united states of america was an actual country with laws and shit instead of 50 scams tied with rope there would have been punished, but at the same time, if that was the case there would not be a stock market in the first place."
2021-05-01 19:06:24,stocks,Because they're ultimately part of the same hydra as the hedgies
2021-05-01 19:08:08,stocks,shhhhhh... dont remind anyone....
2021-05-01 19:10:58,stocks,"Cause they are rich, silly"
2021-05-01 19:15:08,stocks,"Are you surprised? We don’t even actually own are shares no matter what brokerage you use. Welcome to America. Also, that was more of the DTCC’s fault"
2021-05-01 19:21:56,stocks,Because the DTCC upped the margin requirements on GME during the squeeze and multiple brokers were not able to buy with these new requirements because they didn’t possess the liquidity. This was the DTCC’s way to stop the squeeze while they put in new rules to limit the damage the official squeeze will cause. Kind of like a planned demo of a building instead of a small nuclear bomb.
2021-05-01 19:23:38,stocks,"There’s an old saying “the house always wins” the RH will never be punished and even if they do it will be a measly $2 million fine and then back to business as usual. That’s how Wallstreet has operated since its inception, they get away with lying and stealing because the fines for doing so are so miniscule compared to the profits that it’s worth the risk of getting caught."
2021-05-01 19:27:19,stocks,So what are other platforms we can trust that won't be doing stuff like this?
2021-05-01 19:30:02,stocks,"RH has this new campaign for crypto going on, something big coming to RH soon. Perhaps crypto wallets?"
2021-05-01 19:37:45,stocks,"I tried linking my RH account to coinbase via there debit card, and it's the only thing I can't link"
2021-05-01 19:37:54,stocks,Because it makes perfect sense to any sane person why they did it so no reasonable people care.
2021-05-01 19:42:31,stocks,"The golden rule is, those who have the gold make the rules."
2021-05-01 19:42:42,stocks,Double negative threw thee for a loop
2021-05-01 19:43:48,stocks,Because they were protecting more than just Robinhood?
2021-05-01 19:46:47,stocks,"They did nothing illegal. Immoral and overall shitty, but not illegal."
2021-05-01 19:48:05,stocks,"Legaly people signed an agreement in some article was stated ""u consent to being fucked by us at any point""

So is unlikely anything gonna happen"
2021-05-01 19:52:35,stocks,They should be made accountable
2021-05-01 19:53:18,stocks,Because the SEC really is *that* bad
2021-05-01 19:54:13,stocks,"It's probably their ISDA, and the products their client are restricted from. Selling derivatives to retail clients is unthinkable anywhere else in the world, they would have been sued to hell just for that."
2021-05-01 19:56:44,stocks,"Buying was restricted across the world, it wasn't just Robinhood, here in New Zealand my brokerage app blocked my purchases of GME and AMC. 

I think everyone is being naive to think that other US based brokerages won't do something similar sometime in the future. 

Best to have a couple of brokerage options already set up, so you can buy when you need/want to."
2021-05-01 19:57:14,stocks,Samething is happening with webull. Also it's not exactly illegal.
2021-05-01 10:36:00,stocks,[deleted]
2021-05-01 10:11:33,stocks,Because it’s a rigged game.
2021-05-01 09:54:14,stocks,SEC is a cop without a gun. They can't really do anything to people when they do some fucked up stuff. Just look what happened with  Archegos. Guy was able leverage himself with all that margin by lying to banks and YOLO into several stocks. Got margin called and tanked them all and isn't in jail right now.
2021-05-01 10:32:23,stocks,They have to investigate until everyone forgets about it.
2021-05-01 10:09:55,stocks,Because its Wall St. you silly goose.
2021-05-01 10:11:01,stocks,Don’t ever forget this is all about high frequency trading which should be regulated by some kind of tax for the in and out that happens. Elizabeth Warren should pass a bill to text high frequency trading by one cent per share
2021-05-01 13:27:57,stocks,They lost me 5 grand.
2021-05-01 10:09:50,stocks,"RH. Geez. Still shaking head. So glad I closed that account.

Wow. Downvoted because I did the best for me and my family. How nice this sub is."
2021-05-01 10:07:45,stocks,My portfolio bombed by 70% that week.
2021-05-01 10:25:47,stocks,"It's the federal government. Whether it's trump, Biden, Obama, or bush, it's all the same. They serve wall street and corporations not the citizens."
2021-05-01 10:05:44,stocks,"There was a rumour that WhiteHouse called and told em to shut it down, to prevent a complete collapse in the markets/potential bailout if that’s the case they wouldn’t fine them after"
2021-05-01 10:09:14,stocks,Because the House Democrats and senators are going to get a piece of the IPO and make millions of dollars. So there is no regulation or enforcement to protect the average trader/consumer.
2021-05-01 10:13:03,stocks,Until the little guys have the resources to pay off their politicians then nothing changes.
2021-05-01 10:19:46,stocks,"I am actually shocked they did not receive some sort of awards from SEC because ""they saved Market from meme stocks"""
2021-05-01 10:18:38,stocks,"Bc they are the sec, they aren’t going to charge themselves with a heinous crime."
2021-05-01 10:13:49,stocks,I've been seeing a lot of robinhood ads especially on tiktok
2021-05-01 10:16:28,stocks,"#FYI

If you are on margin for anything on RH ( especially GME AMC or other 'meme' stocks) they have recently changed their terms and conditions to state that you basically give them the right to sell your shares whenever they need to without warning you or your consent."
2021-05-01 14:39:25,stocks,Because you elected Joe Biden.  You didn't re-elect Donald Trump.
2021-05-01 15:00:01,stocks,That's why I go full crypto.
2021-05-01 10:15:23,stocks,"Because people keep joining and supporting Robhinhood so there's no real disincentive for them to stop.

Why should they stop when it's more profitable for them to keep doing what they're doing?"
2021-05-01 10:21:12,stocks,I only use it for crypto. I used to use Coinbase but had issues with them so for crypto I use Robinhood but that’s it
2021-05-01 10:23:27,stocks,"Why didn't any of the banks get put on trial? Why didn't any of the politicians that broke the law get arrested? Same answer bud, money is everything"
2021-05-01 10:28:01,stocks,If and when my stop loss or sell limit hits I’ll be heading out the door. F U C K the stock market!
2021-05-01 10:29:23,stocks,"THAT'S EASY: $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸 TALKS.
There is a lawsuit but it will be decades before it is settled. The lawyers will get rich, EVERYONE else gets a used teashirt."
2021-05-01 10:30:13,stocks,"Because it was legal, morally wrong but legal."
2021-05-01 10:48:06,stocks,Why not sue SEC & Robinhood?
2021-05-01 13:47:05,stocks,"The SEC is full of cucks that don’t get paid enough. They eventually want to transfer to big companies, you know the ones they supposedly enforce sanctions on... so it’s a catch 22 of keeping the big fish big."
2021-05-01 14:17:51,stocks,"Because they're a discount brokerage making a few fractional cents a trade. They didn't break any laws, you should expect to get what you pay for."
2021-05-01 14:22:24,stocks,Because they haven't done anything wrong.
2021-05-01 18:58:52,stocks,Because it was a fair move????
2021-05-01 10:24:37,stocks, ToS or Chase is an alternative i found good for moi
2021-05-01 10:26:38,stocks,Also Nkd I think
2021-05-01 10:34:19,stocks,Dense? The hearings are still active this Thursday is another hearing step in boiz
2021-05-01 10:36:07,stocks,"Because the true rule is, 'he who has the gold rules'."
2021-05-01 10:37:24,stocks,That sucks I think robbinhood should let u trade any stock you want
2021-05-01 10:42:21,stocks,Because they are in bed with the enforcers
2021-05-01 10:42:31,stocks,ppl assume we r in point in society where things have some kind of expected level of law and order. it's mostly a facade. its wild wild west out here
2021-05-01 10:44:14,stocks,Sec makes more money by not fining them. It’s all money.
2021-05-01 10:45:12,stocks,Government works for big business. Surprised people still don’t get that.
2021-05-01 10:46:14,stocks,"Because nothing from this would happen if Robinhood wasn’t here, never forget who made you. :)"
2021-05-01 10:48:23,stocks,They don't really care. The government does not serve the people it hasn't on probably the last 40 years in the US. That's actually the best reason to keep investing as we know that the government will always prop up Wall Street and capitalism.
2021-05-01 10:48:38,stocks,I would not feel better even if they did receive a fine lol.....thats the cost of doing business in their world. They would rather have some bad PR then bite the hand that feeds ;)
2021-05-01 10:55:48,stocks,Money
2021-05-01 10:57:53,stocks,Because basically shut the fuck up and get back in line you don't matter.
2021-05-01 10:57:59,stocks,it’s only illegal if poor people manipulate the market
2021-05-01 11:00:28,stocks,Because capitalism is fake!
2021-05-01 11:03:24,stocks,"Answer: Corruption. 
The real question: Why are so many idiots still using it?"
2021-05-01 11:04:27,stocks,Welcome to the rich boys club
2021-05-01 11:06:55,stocks,Because the SEC is too busy grilling DFV and going after Ripple to give a fuck that there are real criminals out there
2021-05-01 11:09:33,stocks,They won't get in trouble because you agreed to their terms of service and their platform is separately formed and only holds so many assets.  Like they can't but/sell something they don't have in house. That's why all the first walls of hedgies are falling and robinhood is fine. They are like a stonk dealer not a market maker.
2021-05-01 11:16:52,stocks,"Because the stock market is rigged, hence our shenanigans."
2021-05-01 11:16:59,stocks,"It was in the T&C

Look for LegalEagle on YT, he published a video at the time"
2021-05-01 11:17:53,stocks,Part three of the Game Stopped  hearing continues on March 8th at noon eastern.
2021-05-01 11:18:27,stocks,"Fucking Robinhood... When tesco reversed split, they took the stocks and didnt even pay me my special dividends. Cost basis is also 0. Last time i sent them an email on cost basis for tax purposes they wouldnt adjust it."
2021-05-01 11:21:18,stocks,"Pretty simple, they are a subsidiary company for citadel, and citadel is a majority market maker, and... the SEC is absolutely rigged with the highest amount of corruption, and they have no incentive to do their job with proper ethics."
2021-05-01 11:24:01,stocks,No transparency left in US markets. It’s like Hong Kong here now.
2021-05-01 11:29:40,stocks,Because the game is rigged. Really simple.
2021-05-01 11:45:49,stocks,"They didn't hurt any billionaires, just poor retail fucks."
2021-05-01 11:45:57,stocks,They were protecting the consumer. /S
2021-05-01 11:48:11,stocks,"Class action lawsuit. The dream of justice happening on its own is just that. A dream. Especially in the US, country of settlements."
2021-05-01 11:51:28,stocks,SEC might be tempted to punish those who didn't restrict trading rather than robinhood lol.
2021-05-01 11:54:23,stocks,Two kinds of people work at govt agencies like SEC. The life time bureaucrats who just want to keep their heads down and not make waves until they retire on their government pension. The second is those who are looking to kiss enough butt for a few years until they can get a Wall Street job at $1 million a year.  Which group is going to discipline RH and Melvin?
2021-05-01 11:58:02,stocks,You expect regulators to actually regulate the rich? Very ambitious. I like it!
2021-05-01 11:59:14,stocks,Are people still using robinhood? It’s a joke of a service with no customer service and no reliability. Get a big boy broker.
2021-05-01 12:05:11,stocks,Because the rules never apply to the Elite.
2021-05-01 12:13:59,stocks,Courts are slow
2021-05-01 12:18:26,stocks,Who’s gonna punish them?
2021-05-01 12:19:09,stocks,Robinhood is trash
2021-05-01 12:19:33,stocks,This is another good chance to remind people: You can leave Robinhood. Talk to another brokerage about reimbursing transfer fees. It worked for me and I had a tiny RH balance
2021-05-01 12:19:52,stocks,The real answer: the legal process is incredibly slow. There are several law firms in NYC pursuing a class action case.
2021-05-01 12:22:11,stocks,One answer: money
2021-05-01 12:24:22,stocks,"get out of robinhood, they are a nest of thieves and liars."
2021-05-01 12:29:54,stocks,Their punishment will at the IPO
2021-05-01 12:48:25,stocks,"Do the research and stop listening to the media.  Robinhood already did a public announcement and interviews explaining why it had to take the action it took.
You just choose to listen to the wrong people and why, even at this point after several months, you are still echoing comments made by people months ago.  Just people, not experts."
2021-05-01 12:48:26,stocks,"Why do police not get charged for all the crimes that they do? You are receiving a lesson in power. As in, you don't have any, and they have all of it. And there is very little you can do about it"
2021-05-01 12:57:12,stocks,I've emailed a bunch of times haha and bout to start spamming there reddit cause it is bullshit dude....I'm getting fucked outta my money when this shit happens and I feel like throwing a chair
2021-05-01 13:34:46,stocks,That’s cuz the game is rigged and we know it is know this and then leverage to benefit you
2021-05-01 13:40:55,stocks,Everyday I tweet Vlad to remind him that I hate him.
2021-05-01 13:52:07,stocks,Its probably not illegal
2021-05-01 13:56:26,stocks,Because it wasn’t illegal
2021-05-01 14:00:33,stocks,Double negatives in the title lol
2021-05-01 14:01:15,stocks,Lol they haven't faced consequences because white collar crime never does in the US. Remember when the economy was crashed in 2008 and the people that caused all went to prison? Yeah I don't remember that happening either.
2021-05-01 14:07:40,stocks,Oh you sweet child.
2021-05-01 14:07:50,stocks,Because it wasn't illegal. Watch legal eagles video on it.
2021-05-01 14:10:49,stocks,What law or rules did they break?
2021-05-01 14:14:50,stocks,Because there is no law they have to obey.
2021-05-01 14:45:31,stocks,Pretty sure Robinhood is just an elaborate Ponzi Scheme. But that are smarter than the SEC (not a huge accomplishment) so they will keep getting away with it.
2021-05-01 14:49:42,stocks,you guys are so incredibly naive
2021-05-01 15:14:44,stocks,because they did what they were told to do
2021-05-01 15:20:37,stocks,Because the government were the ones who told them to shut it down.
2021-05-01 15:54:04,stocks,"They were protecting consumers you fucking morons, those companies were garbage"
2021-05-01 16:08:16,stocks,"I joined a class action lawsuit and they have a good punishment coming from Alabama, lawyers will get all the money but RH won’t have it anymore, so I’m happy. Don’t need their money anyway I’ve got Gabe’s"

2021-05-01 13:28:12,stocks,"Would you know how much the transfer costs to Fidelity? IIRC it was something like $50 but not sure.

Also, does anybody know what they thing was about holding on to 1 stock on RH as a way to mess with their IPO numbers?"
2021-05-01 16:57:56,stocks,"At this point you can’t transfer crypto out of Robinhood because it isn’t a wallet yet. You would have to sell then buy on a new platform, which sucks"
2021-05-01 18:13:56,stocks,Took me *maybe* 5 minutes to fill out the transfer information on fidelity's website and LESS THAN A BUSINESS DAY FOR MY SHARES TO TRANSFER. The only shocking thing is that it took me so long to bite the bullet and transfer. I was worried I might miss MOASS but then remembered that it will take days or weeks of green dildos for me to hit my floor.
2021-05-01 14:39:54,stocks,I’m so confused why people still use them. I had like 100 dollars in there from years ago. Found my password and took everything off for the principle. Fuck that company and the asshole running it.
2021-05-01 13:45:12,stocks,Unfortunately you can’t transfer crypto between brokers. Robinhood is apparently working on crypto wallets but no time table on when that’ll be released. Doesn’t make them any better though.

2021-05-01 15:06:47,stocks,"They just WON’T fulfill some of my orders. Bought an IPO stock and wound up losing on it (I’m something of a beginner), so I sent in a stop loss order to get rid of it.

2021-05-01 17:04:11,stocks,"Was reading about this and it sounds like you can’t transfer partial shares and they simply liquidate them, this would result in a huge sell off for me if I tried to transfer which is why I haven’t"
2021-05-01 17:05:52,stocks,It takes 3-5 business days to transfer assets. 20 minutes to fill out the form.

2021-05-01 18:51:27,stocks,"20 minutes? The only reason I haven't transferred was I was worried it'd take forever or something... already have a Fidelity account, but read it takes like 3 days to 3 weeks or something."
2021-05-01 18:58:21,stocks,I created my fidelity account this weekend and will be doing a partial transfer out of RH Monday. I've heard a partial transfer goes much faster and RH doesn't charge you the $75 fee. I'm not giving those crooked dicks any extra money.

2021-05-01 13:18:26,stocks,How does one do the transfer?
2021-05-01 14:48:53,stocks,Because Webull is worse than Robinhood. I would rather get fucked by an American company. Also for arguments sake if they didn’t stop the buying most people would be crying that they are broke and it’s Robinhoods faults. Also when they lose billions trying to get rich who will pay their margin loses. Either way Robinhood was screwed and so where the investors. You can THANK the gambling addicts at WSB pretending to be for the people
2021-05-01 15:15:56,stocks,See this narrative bothers me...even those who don’t have Robin Hood are affected by there decisions dude
2021-05-01 15:15:59,stocks,With a minimun transfer amount and numerous fees right? Are you going to pay those for OP or just pretend that you know better?

2021-05-01 10:14:44,stocks,"And also because people keep joining and supporting Robinhood so there's no real disincentive for them to stop.

Why should they stop when it's more profitable for them to keep doing what they're doing?"
2021-05-01 13:19:53,stocks,"I fear major pushback for this comment because reddit HATES robinhood after what happened but maybe /u/WickedSensitiveCrew (OP) would like a real answer about who is really to blame. 

The online brokerages are at the mercy of the clearing houses that they work with. Once you buy or sell a trade it takes a few days to settle. The clearing houses are responsible for that process and they require **collateral** in the meantime. 

In the week that GME went to the moon, the clearing houses raised their **normal collateral** required from the normal 2-3% allllll the way up to 100%, but only for Gamestop and a few other names. Kind of a big increase....wouldn't you say? And kind of fishy timing....wouldn't you also say? Was that Robinhoods fault? No, no it was not. 


Most brokerages, even the big ones, couldn't put up 100% so they turned off buying for those equities...they simply had no other choice. 

What Robinhood is guilty of is not communicating this fact to their customers....they basically put out a bunch of bullshit about how it's in the best interest of their customers. They also didn't want to give the appearance that they were having liquidity problems once the requirements were raised from 3% to 100% but of COURSE they were. 

Further complicating these factors was the incredibly large percentage of wall st bets people who used Robinhood at the time. Other brokerages were able to turn back on GME buying quicker despite the new requirements because they had fewer shares of GME to worry about. 

If reddit understood the role of [the DTCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_Corporation) in all of this they would be the real villain, not Robinhood. They are just a humble company with 2.3 TRILLION dollars of equity that most people have never heard of....and which is backed by the biggest financial names in the world. No big deal....I'm sure they are nice people who welcome the internet taking out hedge funds. Nothing to see here. Let's get back to hating a goofy app for stock trading....

Most of our government operates that way. They may, on occasion, do their job to pacify the plebs and provide ""examples of honest work"", but in reality they usually work more to protect the system and provide a facade of accountability."

2021-05-01 12:26:12,stocks,"As an actual answer, there was a whole congressional hearing about it. 

They were blindsided by a huge increase in collateral requirements at their clearing house, due to the sharp spike in volatility. As a result, they were forced to halt buying as an emergency move on those super volatile stocks. 

It took a few days to negotiate a solution for those collateral requirement and raise emergency funding, but they didn't do it for any sinister purpose or coordinate anything. The regulations were implemented after the 2008 financial crisis, and they cannot use their customer's money for that collateral, it has to be money from their cash reserves. 

The solution is to have faster (1 day rather than 2 days, or even near instantaneous) settlement of transactions, and to carefully rethink these clearing house collateral requirements and regulations. 

It wasn't even just Robinhood that had to restrict trading temporarily, also Webull and some other companies were affected and had to limit buying of some highly volatile stocks for a short period of time. 

Only large financial institutions who had low enough volume of such trades, and had more money to float, weren't affected. Non-US trading platforms who don't fall under the US clearing house collateral regulations were also not forced to limit or halt buying of these stocks.

There are no fines or punishments because they did nothing wrong or illegal. It actually was something they really wished they didn't have to do, because obviously their customers would be furious (and of course, they were furious). 

Despite the conspiracy theories that were floating around in the aftermath and the anger it caused, there is no sense in which they were manipulating the market or broke the law."
2021-05-01 10:17:35,stocks,That's pretty much the answer here. I'm actually surprised the Congressional hearings didn't cause them to act more.

2021-05-01 13:31:44,stocks,Also it wasn't Robinhood who made the restriction (according to Robinhood).  The market makers / clearing houses that wouldn't take the orders.
2021-05-01 11:08:30,stocks,this is the right answer
2021-05-01 14:25:53,stocks,"It’s actually very common for brokers to restrict certain stocks for various amounts of time, to control risk and prevent unhappy customers and thus complaints.

Similar to how
- a mechanic might only want to work on certain types of cars
- a grocery store might decide to only sell certain products at any given time
- an insurance company might decide which policies to sell and who to insure, and change those things at any given time
- a restaurant might enforce a dress code some days and not others
- an architect might only accept projects to design certain kinds of homes"
2021-05-01 10:18:06,stocks,"Also not illegal to do a lot of fucked up financial shit.

2021-05-01 14:25:33,stocks,"Surely restricting trading to only selling for a specific arbitrary amount of time isn’t legal though? I get just saying “we don’t offer this”, fine. But the arbitrary restrictions are the problem."
2021-05-01 15:49:52,stocks,I would argue that the dtcc unilaterally making a decision in regards to liquidity requirements amounts to antitrust violations because of their dominant market share and is illegal.
2021-05-01 11:43:42,stocks,So all brokers control the market because they can just limit buying on say MSFT and only let people sell? And they can do this indefinitely? And they can do this while also sharing the information to their partners who are able to profit?
2021-05-01 12:19:03,stocks,It is illegal for them to change what stocks they offer to sell but not buy over short periods of time in order to cause a price change which favours their positions.
2021-05-01 12:40:58,stocks,"No, but it is illegal for a broker to manipulate the market, for example by only restricting certain securities for a certain amount of time during a particularly market event. If they had decided to disable the buying of ALL securities or had indefinitely suspended buying of certain securities instead of only during this particular event, it would have been fine. Now it was clear market manipulation."
2021-05-01 10:11:20,stocks,"It is illegal to purposefully manipulate the market, which is easily provable."
2021-05-01 12:56:23,stocks,"Yes but the timing of it obviously shows collusion. Insider trading is illegal, protecting the short positions of a hedge fund by only allowing users to sell is just brazen. It's laughable that you're even coming close to defending it."
2021-05-01 10:36:37,stocks,"It can’t be that simple. It’s different when you start adding and removing abilities to trade a specific security because of that security’s volatility, volume, and/or price. That’s just obviously market manipulation. But w/e, I’ve never even used RH"

2021-05-01 11:43:20,stocks,"That's not what they did though. They allowed users of the platform to sell shares in certain securities without allowing those same users to buy said securities. Impacts on capital requirements aside, this is antithetical to a functional market. You can't artificially remove one side of a market and then claim it is acting as normal. Restricting just one side of the market artificially impacts the price of the security in a predictable way."

2021-05-01 14:20:12,stocks,I have the same take. Looking at how often Robinhood fails its users I do not understand why any reasonable investor would use that platform. At the same time it is very appealing to a growing number of new investors and all these scandals are good marketing for it in the long term imo.

2021-05-01 10:47:32,stocks,I’m surprised you haven’t been downvoted to oblivion. They didn’t do anything wrong at all. Maybe Vlad’s shit communication skills but that’s pretty much it. If anything as a relatively small broker they were very responsible to restrict those shares to avoid archegos type blow up.
2021-05-01 13:38:53,stocks,They are not obligated to give access to buy all stocks at any time. And the restrictions were because they weren't sure they had the money to settle all the buys.

2021-05-01 14:51:36,stocks,It is if there’s a conspiracy with Citadel
2021-05-01 14:56:27,stocks,It just definitely should be.
2021-05-01 16:05:43,stocks,"That's true, but it's still a super anti-consumer practice and no one is shocked that it permanently shit all over Robinhood's reputation.

If you fuck over your customers, you can't be surprised when everyone suddenly fucking hates you. The customers had a reasonable expectation that they would be allowed to buy the stocks they wanted, at the time they wanted, on the Robinhood platform. Robinhood denied them that, and now the entire company is a pariah.

2021-05-01 12:00:31,stocks,People coming right off of wallstreetbets thinking its a giant conspiracy want to think otherwise.
2021-05-01 14:23:11,stocks,Because the people pushing this narrative are deep into the hole of GME/AMC short squeeze conspiracies. They don't think rationally.

2021-05-01 13:32:06,stocks,Robinhood got the most flack because it has the dumbest userbase.  They sent a message to every single customer explaining why the securities were restricted and named the clearing house that placed the restrictions and yet everyone's a fucking idiot.
2021-05-01 11:39:24,stocks,Fidelity and Vanguard did not block us.  I traded the meme stocks the entire duration and came out barely ahead.  Shouldn't let greed cloud timing though.
2021-05-01 12:42:02,stocks,"Dozens of them did basically the same thing Robinhood did, but not every brokerage. Fidelity and Vanguard were well capitalized and could afford greatly increased dtcc requirements."
2021-05-01 11:00:11,stocks,Fidelity definitely did not do the same thing.
2021-05-01 12:11:51,stocks,Real brokers restrict trading on stocks *all the time*.  The reason this created such an uproar is because a huge amount of RH users have no idea what the fuck they’re doing or why markets are regulated the way they are.
2021-05-01 10:10:46,stocks,Do you know what a clearing house actually does ?
2021-05-01 10:50:36,stocks,People should have left robinhood for frontrunning their trades. Which they were caught doing long before the GME mess

2021-05-01 15:57:59,stocks,They gained millions actually. The only people who care are pissed of GME traders who lost money because of their own idiocy
2021-05-01 12:56:33,stocks,"Notice how it didn't say they may restrict buying or selling, but rather *executing transactions*.  If they had disallowed buying AND selling then they would have had nothing to worry about, however they chose to only restrict buying, which would have clear forseeable effects on the stock, and not only for their own clients.

Anyone who held GME with another brokerage has every right to be upset about Robinhood manipulating the market.  It's difficult to argue that they were unaware that their decision to allow selling but not buying would not affect the stock price."
2021-05-01 12:51:03,stocks,"Why are you surprised that a company cutting corners is not facing consequences?  Robinhood wasn't free, you paid by allowing them to share your order flow, and it is reasonable to expect them not to tank the accounts of their very clients without any warning or consistent explanation for their actions.  Remember, Vlad denied a liquidity issue initially before eventually admitting it."
2021-05-01 12:48:32,stocks,"By allowing selling but not buying, that created forseeable downwards pressure on the stock.  Since it was a forseeable effect and it was not communicated in advance, you can definitely argue that they manipulated the stock, and market manipulation is illegal."
2021-05-01 16:20:44,stocks,"There's only a tiny minority dumb enough to believe either of those things and they just so happen to be very vocal about what they think somebody owes them while typing online.

2021-05-01 14:06:51,stocks,They don't close it though. When you 'delete' your account there is a pop up that tells you just to log back in and your account will be available again
2021-05-01 10:38:22,stocks,"That is how margin always worked. I've historically had my shares liquidated after the margin requirements changed on a volatile move. In the GME debacle, it was insane volatility so insane margin requirements. Nothing new. Every broker does this to varying degrees."
2021-05-01 11:26:05,stocks,"Wrong every margin broker has it set up if you buy an option you can't cover and it needs to be exercised (above strike price at expiry date), instead of margin calling you, they liquidate part/all of your account to cover. Or you get margin called. Which still means your account is liquidated. Make sure you have money to cover your options to prevent this. Its that simple. And those terms were always there."
2021-05-01 14:47:27,stocks,Hahahaha
2021-05-01 15:00:55,stocks,Not very smart.
2021-05-01 10:22:07,stocks,How are people still using RH ?! Like seriously I wonder how many users they still have . Anyone know how to find that out ?
2021-05-01 12:19:13,stocks,"Yep. People have very short memories. Even before the GME fiasco, Robinhood was notorious for having issues on days of massive volatility, where people would lose hundreds of thousands by not being able to log in to make trades. If anything, the free publicity from the GME fiasco was probably a huge benefit for robinhood and they likely have more users today than before."
2021-05-01 13:55:15,stocks,Also the whole not being illegal part.

2021-05-01 15:27:48,stocks,To be fair I tried to sell at .25 on Binance.US during the height of it and couldn’t. The app froze for 20 mins and i was in a full panic. Luckily tho when it came back online it hadn’t dropped and was in the .30’s by then.
2021-05-01 13:52:09,stocks,"I wasn’t able to 🤷‍♂️

2021-05-01 17:45:58,stocks,"No they do not. I would recommend getting a Binance.US (if you're in the US, it's just binance.com outside of it) or Coinbase.com account instead.

None of these companies offering you too buy crypto through their apps, like Robinhood, Webull, or PayPal actually let you own it or keep it in a wallet, which is why you can't transfer it. I started with some crypto in PayPal, which I still have, but moved over to Coinbase. Binance has more coins and I wanted to buy Doge so I opened an account there as well.

Better to actually own the crypto and them letting you move it to wallets or do what you want with it once you buy it."
2021-05-01 17:46:55,stocks,"You don't even actually own it, you can't transfer it to wallets or move out or do anything but buy, sell, and hold. I wouldn't trust them with something like that."
2021-05-01 17:49:19,stocks,"If it's a small amount, just cash out and pull the money out as you can. If it's a large amount do a transfer but make sure wherever you transfer to will waive the $75 transfer fee from Robinhood. You can create an account ahead of time in most places and talk to their customer service to flag your account for the waiver, at least that's how it worked with Schwab."
2021-05-01 16:42:17,stocks,"You also have no control of your wallet, so owning it on Robinhood makes no sense. Get Coinbase or some other platform that lets you control the wallet."
2021-05-01 16:43:26,stocks,You also don’t control you wallet on RH. If you want crypto there are tons of other options.

2021-05-01 10:47:50,stocks,I closed my account too. But a friend of mine just told me they heard about DOGE and decided to buy as much as they could... on robinhood. At 40 cents.
2021-05-01 10:26:26,stocks,"I think more people are transferring out than opening new accounts. I remember somebody on r/GME saying they talked to a fidelity rep that told him over 8M Robinhood users transferred over to them, myself included."

2021-05-01 10:25:07,stocks,"As I told people. Fuck RH, it's trash. I tell people to go with with ETrade and TD ameritrade. But laziness is chronic while anger is fleeting so..."
2021-05-01 19:54:30,stocks,"Robinhood Instant offers margin up to $1,000 for accounts with no minimum in order to subvert settlement rules. FINRA rules clearly state there is no margin for accounts under $2,000. It sure is funny how nobody has questioned that. As in, literally nobody. Do a web search. Literally nobody thinks that's suspect.

I suspect Robinhood pools accounts to
meet FINRA requirements but doesn't fully disclose that to account holders. If that's true, that could explain why suddenly needing 100% collateral was a problem. You have multiple people pulling different amounts
of margin on what is effectively a single
account. A sudden and unprecedented collateral increase could lead to scrambling to compile data you never thought you'd ever need. 

The lack of transparency on how Robinhood Instant works is shady as fuck but all you ""smart guys"" seem to look right past it. Of course, the DTCC dropped the increased collateral requirements before market open that day and y'all don't ever seem to be aware of that either. No broker in the world had increased collateral requirements at market open that day. That's literally why some
brokers were able to allow transactions at all.

Think about it. How can I sell without somebody buying? I can't. Which means selling requires collateral for *somebody*. Which means if there's no buying, there's no selling. But selling was allowed. To who? 

Brokerages and market makers aka the people who got caught with their pants down by the short squeeze. The DTCC is a serious problem, but in this case they're being scapegoated because they're essentially untouchable."
2021-05-01 14:33:37,stocks,"These are great points and I hope everyone reads your comment. Technically speaking, RH didn’t do much wrong, but they certainly could have halted sales along with halting buys on an extremely volatile stock. The reason I think they didn’t is to help out their partners over at Citadel. That’s actually what I think the SEC should be doing something about."
2021-05-01 15:31:01,stocks,"> Was that Robinhoods fault? No, no it was not. 

Nobody says it was. Robinhoods fault is being complicit in market manipulation. They cut a deal with their clearing house to reduce the amount of additional collateral required from 3 billion to 700 Million in exchange for cutting off buying pressure. That is a criminal act."
2021-05-01 10:31:57,stocks,"They didn’t halt trading, they only halted buying."
2021-05-01 10:20:29,stocks,"But isn't it illegal to manipulate the market? And under the circumstances, it seems pretty clear someone was trying to manipulate the market by allowing people to sell but not buy?"

2021-05-01 14:27:38,stocks,"I believe that's only with a margin account. But, in the fine print, you are by default using a margin account in order to have ""instant settlement"" (where they credit your account immediately when you sell and let you use that money to make further transactions, instead of it taking two days every time, and deposited money is useable right away, instead having to wait for it to clear before you can spend it)."

2021-05-01 15:33:35,stocks,"Well, they have trillions in assets and capital to work from stable clients that aren't blowing money on memes with while Robinhood has a fraction of that and has people trading way more than they should.

Always keep 10x capital on hand in case absolutely crazy shit happens? Calling what they and lots of other brokers were forced to do  as ""wrong"" is ridiculous. It's not morally wrong to do something if you are forced to do it. Maybe you can argue the dtcc was morally wrong, but robinhood and the dozens of other brokers didn't really have an option."
2021-05-01 16:29:39,stocks,Its because they don't have to collateralize sells only buys. That is why you were still able to sell

2021-05-01 10:15:33,stocks,"That's crazy how nobody has proved it then. It's much more likely that they did it because of the DTCC requirements which have been well covered, which would be a perfectly reasonable and legitimate business decision for them to make, regardless of your feelings about it."
2021-05-01 10:34:45,stocks,"So like getting together on the internet and convincing others to purchase a security, not on fundamentals, but on the mechanics of the market and in the hope to move the price enough to get short sellers to cover this short positions?"

2021-05-01 10:16:59,stocks,"Lmao, yah, ok"
2021-05-01 13:30:33,stocks,">Yes but the timing of it obviously shows collusion.

No, it does not."
2021-05-01 10:53:32,stocks,All brokers have the right to set their own appropriate risk levels for their business needs. This is especially true when continuing to offer a security would literally bankrupt you because you're unable to meet the collateral requirements.
2021-05-01 10:48:30,stocks,It's literally that simple.
2021-05-01 11:42:36,stocks,"so would you rather they let GME run rampant, can't cover their capital requirements and shut down altogether making sure you can't buy/sell anything in your portfolio for weeks while the whole thing gets sorted out?

Is that the better option?

Or would you rather they shut down buying and selling on those equities, and the people who want to get out now are forced to be ape strong?

What is your better alternative. RH had a problem and they did the best possible thing for all parties involved, yourself included."
2021-05-01 14:31:14,stocks,Just to add: If something is illegal and you put it in your TOS it doesn’t mean jack shit. This has been a tactic used in TOS and contracts for a long time. Just because you signed it doesn’t mean you’re beholden to an illegal section.
2021-05-01 11:50:24,stocks,"It is what they did. They said ""we're not going to obtain these securities on anyone's behalf anymore because it would be detrimental to our business"". That doesn't preclude allowing their customers to unwind existing positions."
2021-05-01 14:30:57,stocks,I agree that I don't think they did anything technically illegal but it seemed really shady. Before then I actually enjoyed using RH especially for the smooth interface and ability to pretend to buy crypto. I didn't know most of the other things they were doing behind the scenes.
2021-05-01 15:57:45,stocks,"""any reasonable investor""

well, there's your problem lol. i think a lot of the RH userbase are people who are brand new to trading, have little money and lots of FOMO. For people outside of the stock world, Robinhood is basically still just a well-known trading platform ""for the everyman.""

I think they must have done at least a somewhat decent job of containing that bad press, because even some people my age I know--who have been trading longer than me--are still on RH and don't seem to see the problem (one buddy told me ""it was Apex's fault not RH so RH is still cool"").

so here's 3 big ass groups of people who aren't necessarily turned off by RH:

1. brand new traders (weren't trading yet when RH fucked up and don't know about it)

2. investors who've never used RH and don't follow these communities/news (maybe have some money in safe stocks earning for them but they don't really follow the market too much)

3. people who are naive and easily manipulated, who subsequently bought into RH's laughable (but apparently effective) we're-still-your-buddy PR campaign. suckers, basically.

that said, a 2-minute Google into a company you plan to invest money with would quickly reveal that they aren't to be trusted with your cash. anyone who doesn't do that probably doesn't deserve the title of ""reasonable investor"""

Still fucked up a large amount of ppls investments. Illegal or legal I would still deem that as wrong"
2021-05-01 19:08:17,stocks,No the responsible move would have been to restrict buying and selling equally. They intentionally or not manipulated the stock price with their action.
2021-05-01 14:56:38,stocks,"It's not that they weren't sure, they *knew* they didn't have the money the DTCC was demanding, which BTW isn't an arbitrary amount but subject to government regulation. So the DTCC told them to restrict opening new positions in **all** stocks. RH managed to negotiate that down to only the most volatile stocks while they tried to raise the money they needed.

This is mostly a tale of incompetence on the part of RH, because the DTCC margin requirements are perfectly predictable if you know what you are doing. But RH apparently failed to pay attention."
2021-05-01 13:30:07,stocks,the current law states that it’s not illegal. On what basis are you gonna punish them? We let you say stupid shit because it’s not illegal to say stupid shit.

A few people have corrected me, IBKR has the lowest margin - I did not know of Interactive brokers

2021-05-01 13:33:01,stocks,Wasn’t the obvious market manipulation the people saying “buy this stock so the price goes up so those who have short positions on it will buy to cover further pushing the price up”?

2021-05-01 18:24:38,stocks,"They had to because of the DTCC due to regulations and other laws, for collateral demands in particular due to the volatility of the squeezed stocks. They need 3 billion in collateral, that they didn't have, leading to Robinhood having to shut down trading.

As well, the billions of volume that were going through Robinhood, due to GME and all the other meme stocks, was completely breaking Robinhood. to the extent that they had to have dedicated servers for individual stocks like GME. Had they not halted trading, it would have destroyed Robinhood servers.

Either way, restricting trading is perfectly legal for brokerages. A lot of people are taking on a ridiculous amount of margin to buy these squeeze stocks, that Robinhood provides. Should the price collapse due to the massive volatility the stock has, those guys get a margin call, go on to default, and Robinhood loses thousands of dollars. If stocks are too volatile for brokerages to enable users to buy on margin, then they have the right to block it. After all, they're taking out Robinhood's money to buy the stock."

Obviously what they did is unethical and unfair to the average investor using their app but there's no case against them for breaking the law. They were literally following the directions and regulations that the market has made. Tell me what law or regulation they broke and I'll give you $100.

If each person put like $100 on the table, that sounds like a billion+ dollars to me.

If you buy call contracts (100 shares), then you are pretty much exaggerating the purchases by many multiples. Add on quite a few degenerates who add on margin on top of this and boom, yes... there are billions to move smaller cap companies.

And considering there are a few that post YOLO of 6\~7 figures, wouldn't be surprised. I mean one of my friends (who follow WSB discreetly) I know YOLO-ed 8 figures early last year in Tesla calls.

Don't underestimate gambling degenerates. That entire subreddit is pretty much the biggest pump and dump forum you can get access to today. Mods there can create mini stock manipulations to their needs."
2021-05-01 13:27:53,stocks,Wasn't it the buy vs. sell order overhang that caused the higher collateral requirements for brokers? That was directly caused by hyped buying. Short-selling does not come into the picture here.

2021-05-01 13:19:12,stocks,If they did go belly up and were forced to liquidate customers positions wouldn’t they use that money to cover a margin call/ pay off debts? Even though that does sound entirely illegal and wrong to me I feel like they would do that. But I could be entirely incorrect on that.
2021-05-01 11:54:37,stocks,"Since they only had 13 million users as of last year, you're asserting that they've lost 60-75% of their users? Unless you have some sort of source for this, I think you're just being wishful."

2021-05-01 12:47:23,stocks,"Correct!

Robinhood drew a lot of people into investing with low barriers, but the same low barriers means people don't know what due diligence is or anything about the stock process.

Stock trading has become a spectacle. I'm surprised we haven't seen more integrated Twitter posts the way venmo turns private transactions into public ones."

2021-05-01 16:35:42,stocks,"Not really. It was against many people’s interest for that bull raid to froth up and by raising capital requirements for clearing from 3 percent to 100 percent a private company who controls stock clearing for the world made it impossible to do business for the smaller brokers (robinhood) and at the same time spread fear over the media. Sure people who are most mad lost a lot of money and now some of them are in a cult but let’s not pretend that because it is within the dtcc’s power to do that it does not amount to antitrust violations. 

You can think that the government doesnt like the outcome or that they are neutral but they have two competing interests here—fundamentally strong financial system and even more important harnessing populism especially in regards to inequality. So senators are able to yell at vlad and pretend they are on the little guys side while in reality they are happy they were able to manipulate back in order to address the financial mania/hysteria and return to normal market conditions.

But please explain why it is nonsense."

2021-05-01 14:25:09,stocks,Depends on how it was done. If Citadel played any role in getting any of the brokers to stop allowing buys with their financial interests could be illegal under market manipulation.

2021-05-01 10:39:32,stocks,"Halting only one side doesn’t make it manipulation either. It actually makes it more clearly not manipulation.

2021-05-01 10:26:29,stocks,They claim not to have the capital to allow buys because of the how unstable that market was that day.  They couldn’t cover their customers orders.

Before halting trading in those securities, robinhood restricted using margin on them. Cash only purchases allowed. That choice also could reduce the buy side of the market like a halt does, but similarly is also not manipulation.

Robinhood made NATIONAL headlines one full year before the whole game stop debacle. If you were too lazy to not research the broker you signed up with, were too lazy to read their EULA that includes this, I don’t feel sorry for you.

A broker that has fucked over people fucked them over again and all those people are somehow *surprisepika.jpg*"

2021-05-01 18:30:15,stocks,"Uhhh, but they are allowed to do that. They can literally offer whatever they want or don’t want at any time. They could have terminated every account that owns GME if they really wanted to and be legally fine even though it would be very frowned upon by their customers. Just because you personally feel it shouldn’t be that way doesn’t make your feelings in any way legally binding. To note, I completely agree with you what they did was in bad taste, but they didn’t do anything illegal."
2021-05-01 10:41:03,stocks,"The whole issue around Robinhood is more than whether or not it was illegal what they did.

Trump did lots of legal things. That doesn't mean he shouldn't have to face consequences."
2021-05-01 13:44:36,stocks,"As far as I know it was even way beyond that, initially it's 1-3% but for GME it went to even over 100% at times. Over 100% to compensate for fluctuation in such an insanely volatile stock, similar to when you purchase 10 100$ shares with 500$ but suddenly your capital is negative and they force sell one or the entire order. Usually it's one. But since the market works in milliseconds the difference between pressing the buy button and starting the order vs actually having the order go through the clearing is enough to cause this"
2021-05-01 18:11:49,stocks,"So essentially some brokers didn't have enough money to cover the transactions of the trading in their own firms. Some brokers like Fidelity didn't halt trading of GME or other stocks and they somehow were able to cover their transactions. Other brokers like Robinhood have problems covering their transactions. Not just GME, but lots of other stocks and now even Dogecoin.

At what point will you stop blaming the DTCC and start looking at the actual broker? Fidelity has no problem, lots of other brokers don't have nearly as many of these problems, but somehow Robinhood has much more of these money problems and need to halt trading.

Have you considered the fact that maybe Robinhood is actually stretching themselves too thin because they're being too greedy in then they end up halting trading more than any other broker?"
2021-05-01 16:34:37,stocks,I don’t see how that would effect trades that weren’t with leverage or incomplete deposits.
2021-05-01 12:34:03,stocks,My problem with the situation is that I don't feel it was ever fully explained in the Hearings. They had the first hearing where Vlad said that everything was due to the early morning phone call asking for $3 billion. Then he agreed to a reduced amount as long as he blocked certain stocks. During that hearing it was clear that people wanted more information on that sequence of events and wanted to hear from the DTCC and NSCC. But the second hearing covered none of that and was only focused on the gamification of Robinhood.

2021-05-01 12:25:01,stocks,Just cause the TOS says they can do something doesn’t mean it’s legal for them to do it; common practice is to fill them with everything regardless of the contents would have legal standing
2021-05-01 19:04:26,stocks,"I got you. TOS are nice for covering ass initially but can ultimately fail. For example, the TOS require that users enter into arbitration to resolve claims against the company; however, there are such a high number of lawsuits from individuals that they now form a class and are taking Robinhood to court over this matter. So yes, it is in their TOS, but that’s not a panacea. 

Actually, upon reading that sentence about restricting my trades, it says “Robinhood… at their sole discretion… restrict…” but if they take the advice of outside companies, like Citadel, or are compelled by them, it may violate that because they are no longer the sole group involved in the decision. 

I’m eager to see what discovery from the lawsuits finds out. If they’re smart, they took all comms offline, if they did collude / conspire, so there may be nothing to find."
2021-05-01 10:09:23,stocks,"Exactly. Fidelity is nowhere near as easy to use. Much less clear, much slower in response time.

Robinhood limited the buy on all of these stocks which directly drove down the price. They choked the bids of over 50 companies, driving each price down by atleast 15%. 

So let's look at this objectively. 
Market manipulation is the act of artificially inflating or deflating the price of a security or otherwise influencing the behavior of it. 
They choked the bids on purpose. This is clear, not an opinion. 
That is artificially driving down the price of all 50 securities, some of which have no ties to the huge fiasco the action was centered around. 

Are you telling me that there was another reason for AMD, an incredibly promising tech company, dropped 20+% in one day and that was an organic event which could happen on any other normal day? They directly moved the prices of these securities WHCH IS MANIPULATION. They have done this before, have been sued, and settled. So if they were guilty then, why not now? What different?"
2021-05-01 14:22:47,stocks,How not? Use a stock like AMD for example that they halted to explain how it wasn’t.

2021-05-01 15:46:45,stocks,"They probably don’t have the capital for the amount liquidation that was expected with the new high of 40¢. The DTCC is required to make spot calls whenever they feel a position is becoming too large for the company to cover that holds those shares at the time. (DTCC is the middle man between seller and buyer btw). So because of this they are obligated to keep the seller in check by making sure the brokerage holding the stock shares, or crypto for this example, have the necessary capital forcing the restriction. 
I’d wager it wasn’t Robbinhoods desire to restrict but was forced to by the DTCC for their call.

Switch platforms if you’re using Robbinhood. A brokerage that doesn’t have the availability to give their sellers the necessary capital and then restrict trades is disgusting. 

(Brother use to work at DTCC and he’s told me about multiple times where he’s had to make
Calls to companies about their risk of not being able to cover positions.)"
2021-05-01 13:57:08,stocks,"they inflate the price of Doge on their platform as well, so they can scalp and manipulate the price you see on screen.

2021-05-01 17:30:53,stocks,"I bet they never purchased all the doge coin in the first place to be able to sell.

When doge spiked, they didn't have the cash to actually cover the transactions."

2021-05-01 15:43:50,stocks,The thing is it doesn’t matter. Either they’re telling the truth and are a shit platform that keeps having technical and liquidity problems or they’re lying to you and robbing you. Both options mean you should be leaving them.
2021-05-01 13:32:22,stocks,By the way you don't really get the coin on RH. It's more of an IOU. So any crypto you purchase can't be transferred to a wallet.

2021-05-01 14:08:03,stocks,From what I understood RH owned like 30% of doge. Seems like they wanted to be able to sell before they let anyone else on the platform. Just my opinion and not 100% on the exact amount they owned but it was a large %.
2021-05-01 14:25:42,stocks,"The clearing house responsible for their crypto, Apex Clearing, wasn’t allowing them certain transactions due to “high volume.” Apex is used by a lot of companies so it’s not just Robinhood doing this sort of thing. 

However, Robinhood is also incentivized occasionally to operate against your best interest because they sell order flow and things to hedge funds and other financial institutions like Citadel.

They restricted GME to protect their assets, then began to ban anything mentioned in /r/WSB including AMC, NOK, and BB as a way to say they are combating market manipulation (read: we're comitting market manipulation and blaming it on everyone else). They are likely banning as much as they possibly can to build up rapport, so they can say that this was a move that they felt was 'morally correct', even though it will effectively kill RH buuut I bet they determined this is cheaper than any lawsuit settlement."

2021-05-01 18:50:30,stocks,What makes it a conspiracy theory?
2021-05-01 18:45:59,stocks,There is no regulatory requirement for brokers to manipulate the market during high volatility events. In fact it's illegal for them to do so. In order to comply with regulatory requirements Robinhood had to post 3 billion in collateral. Eliminating the option to buy stock was never a requirement. It was a negotiation tool to lower the collateral amount that they were required to provide. Robinhood factually manipulated the market and threw retail under the bus. The fact that they did it to cover their own asses does not justify the crime.
2021-05-01 11:40:17,stocks,">which is obviously not manipulation since it was done for a clear business purpose required of them by law.

That...doesn't automatically mean it isn't manipulation. Allowing sales of shares but not purchases will create downward pressure on stock price by artificially restricting the natural function of the market."

2021-05-01 13:38:31,stocks,"I was amazed Fidelity didn't put any restrictions on GME.  Brokers tend to have an automated system where if volatility goes too high they limit behavior, reducing margin at first, then going to more extreme lengths if volatility goes even higher.

What made Robinhood so terrible is the CEO is a chronic liar.  Who wants to trust that?  It goes further than just limiting the buying of AMC stock.

But if you limiting buying stock is a big deal to you, then IBKR, Robinhood, Webull, and M1 should be avoided.  Most brokers did not limit the buying of AMC stock."

2021-05-01 10:56:28,stocks,"The question as far as penalties are concerned is always about legality.

The rest is your personal choice as a consumer to switch services. Or you can support political candidates who are going to do something about it.

But honestly, from what I can tell robin hood would have cratered itself if it allowed trading due to the way obligations are handled. The broker ends up responsible for paying when the other side of the deal can’t settle it’s debts(as the bankrupted shortest would have been). I don’t see what other option they had there than stopping trading. Should they be legally forced to provide a service that digs them deeper into a hole?"
2021-05-01 19:09:19,stocks,"Have you considered the fact that robinhood is new with 20B aum, and fidelity is old with 4.9T aum. Where on earth is robinhood supposed to get 3B to post from when they have never even earned 3B in *revenue,* let alone profit, over the course of their lifetime? They needed a massive loan with no notice to cover it. 

Another huge reason they had trouble and fidelity and Vanguard didn't is the makeup of their customers. Something like half of robinhood customers went allin on gme. Vanguard probably had like 3% or less buying a small amount. I'm pretty confident if fidelity/Vanguard had half their aum liquidated in order to buy GME, they'd also have trouble and would have had to limit buys. The capital requirement changes weren't a fixed amount, it was relative to what their customers were doing. No brokerage is prepared  to have large percentages of their clients liquidate to go allin on meme stocks at the same time. Fidelity and Vanguard clients are just largely buy/hold indexers, so they can accommodate the small percent of customers wanting to do it."

But again, disregard that hypothetical and consider the fact that no brokerage is required to broker all securities.

2021-05-01 18:34:06,stocks,"I'm not seeing any honest attempts at answering your question.  We won't know for sure but there are theories.  For cashapp to actually sell coin they need to go buy a bunch of coins.  RH isn't doing this so they are just issuing IOUs for the coins.  They basically get exposure to the market, can collect your money selling it to you and because you can't move it they don't actually have to buy any.  

For them to handle the doge craze they would have had to go out and buy all that doge ahead of time.  They would also need to set up nodes for all the different coins they could carry (which is why many exchanges only carry one coin) and have rails that allow people to move on and off.  The technical setup would have added cost, possibly new regulations they would have to deal with all so their customer, who tend to not be buy and hold types, can sell off later on, usually.  

This will normally work out for them as they don't carry many things that have high potential for moonshots.  Doge is damn near 10 years old and is a known meme, no one expected what has happened recently.  RH probably didn't expect to have to cover what was probably billions of dollars being pull off their network to pay those IOUs.  

So again, for the second time in a matter of months they are left deciding whether to go insolvent or stop user function to prevent themselves from going insolvent.  Remember when Vlad talked about how you can't stop people from selling, that's a line they just couldn't cross?  That was his response when asked why he didn't turn off buying and selling of GME instead of just buying.  Well with doge they showed it's not about meeting any requirements as there are none with doge besides having enough money to cover, which they don't.  

tl:dr - RH wants to be able to make money from people taking degenerate gambles on crypto but don't have enough money to cover when something goes viral and moonshots.  But their platform is easy at allowing those to happen due to ease of use.  

Edit: just realized there's a much easier tl;dr - RH is basically naked short selling any cryptos they carry with the hopes it doesn't actually take off before you ask them to close the position.  They might have someone who does actually buy the cryptos for them but they aren't set up in a way for them to be able to sell their holdings and pay off customers fast enough.  So it could be legal but functionally impossible for them to keep up during such a crazy time.  

In other words, if you want to lose money or make small gains RH is good enough.  If you want to make real money off trades you should avoid them.  If you're doing long term investing there are much better options as RH doesn't even offer IRAs, the best long term investing vehicle ffs."

Doge is a likely a different problem unrelated to the previous issue as the dtcc isn't involved with crypto clearing. Maybe they shouldn't have offered crypto in case all their customers jumped on at the same time, I guess, but I don't see it as some big deal is. Oh no, you couldn't buy crypto on one specific day.

Let's be real. Robinhood literally couldn't cover it. Where were they supposed to get $3B from when that's more liquid cash than they've ever seen in history?"

Posts like these are obvious examples of people not understanding how brokerages work, and subs like this and r/options being filled to the brim of people not having any clue what they're doing, but consider themselves to be financial geniuses off of reading ridiculously misinformed GME ""MOASS"" DDs that sound complex, but really are just laughably bad.

My intention was to point out that ""terms of service are rarely enforceable"" is wrong, and I *really* hope people don't go around believing that when they click agree that's going to be consequence-free.

The irony is that since all these WSB retail traders chose Robinhood, they had a lot bigger issue than other brokerages due to the massive amount of GME buying. I think it was around 50% of customers had GME on Robinhood. They even said it was a five sigma event which isn’t really reasonable to expect them to manage perfectly, especially since they are a smaller company. Obviously it wouldn’t happen in an ideal world, but other more established brokerages also had an issue which says something to the stress Robinhood must have been under."

Anyway, how does all you write relate to Robin Hood (and the other brokerages)? They clearly had reasons within their own business interest to restrict trading. They could not come up with collateral and had to act to save their business.

Is your theory that they did what they had to do, but more of it than strictly necessary because, while trying to save their own businesses, in parallel they secretly conspired with other unaffiliated market actors - and goverment! - in order to bail those other actors out? I assume RH is not the brokerage of choice for the unhedged (?) market makers you describe."

I am not saying the government organized the change in capital but that they are happy to see it happen because it aligns with their interests and the interest of the financial system. Which is why we are not seeing the house brought down over what one side perceives as unfair.

You seem to be so overcharged with defeating paranoid conspiracy that you at least in these comments seem to not appreciate the nuance of the situation.

Then you should move to shwabb, Ameritrade, binance, coinbase, webull, etoro, etc.  I use them all for different purposes and I only make like 40k a year but the lack of fees, the transparency and if your using a metamask, the lack of taxes is huge."

2021-05-01 16:51:31,stocks,Both?
2021-05-01 17:01:35,stocks,Yes.  The dividends are from their profits which are taxed as income. The remaining earnings after taxes go to their cash pile which is where the dividends or buybacks are paid out of.
2021-05-01 17:04:36,stocks,"By “both” were you asking about “dividends paid” and “buybacks”? 
If so, yes. I'm not sure if you have an Accounting background? There is something called “Retained Earnings” or excess capital/ cash the business is currently holding after all expenses are paid. Taxes are a part of that expense.
Some businesses grow to a point where they can no longer grow, and so they declare larger dividends for their shareholders. 
It's a deeper level management decision, where the they have to decide what is best use for the cash. Some return that excess cash/ profit back to their shareholders.
Share buyback is a more challenging process because it can only be used effectively when the price of the company's shares fall that the market is undervaluing the company’s underlying business or “intrinsic value”. Unfortunately, majority of management teams abuse the “share buyback” process to artificially increase the price of the company's stocks because they think that is the best way to create value for their shareholders with the excess cash/ profits. 

To answer your question, yes both dividends are paid with after-tax profits (net income) and share buybacks are done with after-tax profits (net income)."

IIRC Buffett said he won't invest in Microsoft because of his friendship with Gates, but that still leaves Amazon and Alphabet. They have only a very tiny position in Amazon. Something like Costco is available as well. For some reason after 20 years of ownership Buffett actually sold that one recently."

2021-05-01 18:40:43,stocks,Not many CEOs have the company's name as their own last name without founding it. All hail Tim Apple
2021-05-01 19:28:43,stocks,"I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Tim Apple is an operations guy.  Tim's skill set is optimizing the shit out of his spreadsheet.  He's not a visionary like Steve Jobs and will not do anything truly revolutionary, which is why Apple will just keep pumping out iterations of their phones which is just better enough than the last iteration to get people to upgrade, and enter new markets by doing things just better enough than existing players to grab some market share.

Right now people feel Apple can do no wrong.  Well, that's how people thought about HP and IBM before.  Tim Apple's competent enough to not screw up.  What about the next CEO?"
2021-05-01 18:53:52,stocks,"I'd like to see a disciplined proof of Tim Cook as ""best CEO in the world"".  

First of all, drawing Secretariat as your horse doesn't mean you're the world's best jockey.  

Second, his function has largely been that of milking the most possible money out of cell phones.  Apple hasn't invented anything since before Steve Jobs died... since Jobs was healthy, actually.

Apple's consumer halo has tarnished a fair bit under his leadership.  The products are now more grudgingly accepted than beloved.  Product announcements aren't aspirational events anymore, they're exercises in financial analyst skulduggery.  And launches don't generate buoyant camp-outs, they just trigger griping about what feature was scrapped and which new defect will drive which new recall and/or rationalization campaign.  I'd argue that any other bean counter could do that.  

Under Cook, Apple has gone from a prestige employer to just another corporation.  What and who has he inspired?  Where is the culture-defining advertising?  Where's his Chiat-Day? Where's his Jony Ives?  Where's his Pixar?  What market has he disrupted?  How is Beats doing?  How is Apple TV?

His main inventions:  

* not including needed sockets
* not including earphones
* not including a charger

Apple is still practicing corrupt accelerated obsolescence, stealing digital content after you bought it, environmental damage, monopolistic behavior, and exploiting sweatshop labor.  They're still the Tony Soprano of crooked opposition to right-to-repair.  He's made no progress towards being a made in America company.  

How is that ""best CEO in the world""?  He took an *interesting* and massively profitable cell phone company and transformed it into a *boring* and massively profitable cell phone company.  Anyone could have done that.  

If I'm looking for positives, I guess I could say that once it was 110% personally safe for him to do so, he came out.  And he has been holding the line on topics related to privacy, I guess.  

But I just don't see what amazing accomplishment or inspiration he's demonstrated.  

Edit: for the fanboys that have started polluting my inbox, this isn't an anti-AAPL post.  It's a counterpoint about Tim Cook as CEO.  I literally wrote a piece yesterday that was optimistic of Apple's future and stating I was considering buying more shares.  You'd like that one better."

That's the biggest myth in the industry, created and indoctrinated by those who want you to think active participation and awareness are impossible and bad... and so you just close your eyes and trust them instead.  For a fee.  And if they fail, don't blame them, because... ""You can't time the market!""

Notice that every bank, mogul, institution, fund, billionaire, millionaire, pension, sovereign, university, muni, hedge, family office, farmer, corporation, money manager, insurer on earth devotes most of their resources and personnel to spending 24x7x365 timing the market.  Yet they tell you ""it doesn't work"".

It's nonsense.  Even the lemmings who believe and spread it don't accept the myth in any other aspect of their existence.  They time the market looking for Black Friday sales.  They sell their house when the market is hot, and they try to buy a snow shovel in the spring when it goes on clearance.  The farmer keeps his crop in a silo waiting on the peak price, and the car buyer tries to grind for a better deal near month end when the dealer is supposedly more motivated.  When soup goes on sale, we buy a bunch of extra cans.  

Literally everything in our life is governed by ""timing the market"" yet we're supposed to believe it doesn't work when it comes to the actual, literal market?  

Hogwash.  

It was more than possible to time the market when Disney stock dropped under $80 and MSFT dipped to $130.  And it was pretty obvious when Palantir popped to $45 during the GME frenzy, it was appropriate to ""time the market"" and cash that in.

Timing the market absolutely does work."

2021-05-01 16:49:15,stocks,"Mod here. Don't engage the trolls, report and move on."
2021-05-01 14:47:55,stocks,It’s not literally 1:1 because the stock price is determined by emotions not logic. But it’s essentially accurate.
2021-05-01 17:57:17,stocks,"A share price is really meant to reflect the worth of a company at a moment in time. If we massively simplify that to mean a company is simply the assets less the liabilities, then we have a company worth, and the share price \* number of shares equals that. 

&#x200B;

Now, once such asset is cash. So if a company then choose to give cash out to shareholders, that must logically reduce the worth of the company because we've reduced the assets. 

&#x200B;

In a purely logical and fundamental extension of that, then the company is worth less and so the share price reduces. 

&#x200B;

Of course there are technical and imperfections in the market (including people, and all sorts of external factors), and this is why a share price can sometimes reduce more or less than the dividend, but basically, the way I think about it is above, and that helps me get my head around it!"
2021-05-01 16:39:24,stocks,"I think you’re getting mixed answers on “automatic.” If I’ve interpreted you correctly I think you intended it to be synonymous with enforced but some people have responded interpreting it as instantaneous.

The following is my understanding.

TLDR: Both supply and demand curves move by 4¢ because both buyers and sellers evaluate the return they will get from the stock as 4¢ less. This causes the price to change by 4¢.

Not TLDR: There is no enforcement of a change in price whether by clearing house, computer, or other entity (so far as I know anyway. Hypothetically I guess any of these could try to manipulate the price, but why manipulate to the same spot I expect market forces to take it.) Because information on the dividend is known well in advance the price can change nearly instantaneously in response to the dividend from the moment just before close to the moment just after open, when the stock is no longer entitled to the dividend.

The price decreases approximately 4¢ because approximately everybody knows they will get 4¢ less value from owning it. This applies to both sellers and buyers. 

A trade occurs at what a buyer and seller each consider to be fair by their own evaluation (ignoring exceptions)

Suppose two people were about to trade $20.04 for one share because the seller wanted the cash and the buyer the stock, but they just missed market close and have to wait til the next day. So they come back next morning, both know the stock will provide 4¢ less to the owner, so the buyer now sees their fair price as 4¢ less and likewise the seller, when they evaluate the stock, see it as worth 4¢ less. The buyer offers 4¢ less at $20 (assuming the only thing that changed in their evaluation was that the stock will now provide them 4¢ less return,) the seller accepts what they believe to be a fair offer from the buyer and the price of the most recent trade is now $20 not $20.04 like it would have been the day before.

I saw someone suggest that the dividend comes from the market cap or maybe worded it like it comes out of the stock price in some non market enforced way, I disagree. Market Cap= Shares*Price like you said, the above explains a change in share price in response to a dividend, the market cap follows not the other way around.

Saw another comment about the share price changing because of a post dividend sell off, again I disagree. If there was a sell off or buy up it would be because investors for whatever reason want to get rid of or accumulate shares based on the timing of the next dividend, but it would seem strange to me that this wouldn’t be priced in since dividends in the market happen frequently and if there was always a sell off after a dividend people would learn to expect it, and trade accordingly in anticipation of a loss of value. If there was for whatever reason a sell off or buy up it would be in addition to the expected 4¢ change, that’s my take.

Edit: Changed a clause in final paragraph"

2021-05-01 18:03:04,stocks,"You're correct that it's not 1:1, not automatic, and not controlled by the security itself.  The market decides.  

If owning a stock on Tuesday is going to pay me a known 40 cents, but that same stock has some negative news that I decide hurts its potential by 10 cents, I might decide it's worth paying 30 cents extra for it.  But I might also factor in that the 40 cents won't be delivered for a couple weeks, which is an opportunity cost, so maybe I'll only which to pay 28 cents extra, not 30.  But maybe there's a sense of strengthening demand in their market sector, which I guess is worth a further 15 cents.  But maybe I want to gamble that less diligent investors might only be thinking of the 40 cent dividend, and that they might sell off the stock after Tuesday regardless of the improving market, so maybe I'll wait and get a better price.  Or maybe there's an entire market wide sell off that day, or a market-wide surge.  The point is: outside of the pure dividend-dedicated securities, there's too many factors to say that shares move 1:1 with their dividend."
2021-05-01 14:46:06,stocks,I have no clue to your question but here’s an up vote to heaven
2021-05-01 15:51:31,stocks,I was chatting with my brother who understands all of this. I know how to buy and hold and that's about it. I told him that I just found out that nvda has been paying me dividends all this time. Oh boy he got angry about dividends!  Telling me about how dividends reduce the value of the stock and such. I told him that I bought nvda at $180 and have all of my dividends as cash in my account.  I had never noticed if the dividends affected the price on those dates.
2021-05-01 15:13:19,stocks,">Is it actually 1:1 like that?

most of the time. the dividend is paid out of the share price, and the share price drops the exact amount of the distribution. this also applies to stocks or ETFs/funds that pay dividends. 

occasionally there's a special distribution that doesn't come out of share price, but it's usually 1:1. they pay a dividend of $X, so the next day the stock price is minus-X. 

>Does the stock price adjust down automatically by that exact amount? 

most of the time, yes. 

>I was under the impression that prices were **only** affected by supply and demand. 

you're confusing a few different things. ""only thing"" affecting prices? no. primary thing affecting prices? yes. 

supply & demand will *in general* explain a lot of why prices go up or down: stock prices, housing prices, lumber prices, food prices. 

but with a dividend, you're in the same position after as before: you buy stock for $10. it pays a 5% dividend of 50 cents. you had $10 cash, bought $10 in stock. they pay the dividend, now you have $9.50 in stock and 50 cents in cash (or you have $10 in stock if you re-invested). ta-da! same position after the dividend as before the dividend: $10 is $10 is $10."
2021-05-01 14:51:26,stocks,"It is adjusted 1:1. But due to the market it might just increase that right away. One of the websites used to track how long it took a stock to recover its dividend drop. Sometimes it was 0 days, others it was 4. Just depends on the stock and if more are going to buy it and it increases. 

Also, you didn’t do the math right for a 1:1. If the stock is 20.04 and paid a .4 dividend it would go to 19.64."
2021-05-01 16:55:32,stocks,"Thanks for reposting the question. I had read that previous exchange and thought your comment made sense, but left confused because of all the other comments."
2021-05-01 14:49:13,stocks,"For stocks with dividends, when earnings are about to be announced, some investors buy the stock to cash in the dividends and sell later. The prices usually go back down to per-dividend levels that are driven by long term investors. 

It's not 1:1 though. If the earnings beat the market and the company is showing growth, the stock may continue to go up."
2021-05-01 16:30:08,stocks,so would dividends be naturally averaging down if it goes back up? And the only time dividends are significant is when they start to compound right?
2021-05-01 17:36:18,stocks,"The best way I wrap my head around it, if you could take a stock and duplicate it, say one will pay a dividend and one won't, and let the market do its thing, then you'd see the one not paying dividend move up a bit higher, probably close to the dividend price. Now moth could go up around 10% that day since it's the market. But one not paying dividend would go up 10% + dividend. 

The other way I like to think is that there is a lot of algorithms trading. And if buying a stock for a few days to get the dividend and reselling always made money, those algorithms would be all over it. But in general I think it's a wash."
2021-05-01 17:53:25,stocks,"All other things held constant and in a perfect world, that’s exactly how it works. The dividend is priced in, and once it’s paid out the value drops by the corresponding amount. So a rational buyer will bid 20.04 at closing but 20.00 at open.

Then of course there are other aspects which can affect the stock price. 

So it is 1:1 like that, but there can be other things happening simultaneously which obscures it. So it all depends on your point of view. 

Will the fact that the dividend is paid out affect the market price by that amount? Definitely. Think about the difference between dirty and clean price of a bond before and on the coupon date. 

Will you be able to identify a market price drop of exactly the dividend for all stocks? Definitely not."
2021-05-01 15:04:58,stocks,"I think our friend Yogi Berra has a quote that explains what your seeing ""In theory there is no difference between theory and practice.  In practice there is.""

2021-05-01 18:17:23,stocks,"Simple and clear explanation, thanks!"
2021-05-01 18:50:17,stocks,"Thank you for your detailed explanation!  This part was very insightful:

As well as the later note about buys ups and sell offs.  See, that was what I understood... buy stock for dividend (price goes up), sell later (price goes down).  But what you said about how that's extra price action on top of the expected 4¢ makes a lot of sense.

Stock prices are affected by many factors, and dividend is only one such factor.  And which the tax situation with dividend is technically real and known, the presence of a dividend can be an attractant to certain buying communities and a bulwark against some selling pressures.  Some securities are even set up a pure dividend paying vehicles."

2021-05-01 18:26:39,stocks,"OP here, not sure how to answer your question.  Maybe someone else can or you could try asking in the daily thread."
2021-05-01 18:29:13,stocks,">The best way I wrap my head around it, if you could take a stock and duplicate it, say one will pay a dividend and one won't, and let the market do its thing, then you'd see the one not paying dividend move up a bit higher, probably close to the dividend price. Now moth could go up around 10% that day since it's the market. But one not paying dividend would go up 10% + dividend.

I have a question about this, though.  In theory, yeah, the dividend-paying company is worth less because they pay out some of their assets (cash) to their shareholders.  That said, in reality, I know that there are many investors who are actually interested in getting a dividend, and preferably a big one.  So you could say that they're willing to pay a small premium in order to have that cash delivered to them directly.  Thus the dividend-paying stock could equal or even surpass the non-paying stock in value.

Am I correct about this?"
2021-05-01 19:56:22,stocks,"No problem, glad I could provide some insight, and thanks!

I also just remembered that stop orders exist, I don’t have any idea how big a factor this might be as far as sell offs, but conceivably the price drop after a dividend could trigger stop loss orders. So maybe a post dividend sell off is more realistic than I supposed in my first comment."
2021-05-01 14:58:11,stocks,"And outside of the standard normal factors that go into a stock price, the demand just so happens to drop by the dividend amount on the ex div date"
2021-05-01 18:37:52,stocks,"As you've pointed out, for some stocks, the dividend is inconsequential.  People don't even think of their NVDA dividend since the daily swings are much larger anyway.  For some, especially the monthly payers, the dividend is everything, and you can basically see the share price move by around 1/30th every day."
2021-05-01 15:53:02,stocks,"Yeah, you are right. Share price of a company is basically just a secondary market based on what people are willing to buy/sell for. Not necessarily even tied to anything fundamental about the company as seen in many bubbles."
2021-05-01 16:10:17,stocks,"So when everyone on here is answering with this 1:1, they are answering in theory. 

In theory say a share is trading at 10 dollars on it ex-dividend date, and the dividend is 1 dollar. Theory says the stock should be trading at 9 dollars the next day. I.e. investors willing to buy the stock the day after the ex-dividend date should only be willing to buy at 9 dollars, as the company has paid to its investors 1 dollar of its value that new buyers are not entitled to. (assuming nothing else has changed). 

In practice this generally does not happen, you will most often see a drop, but rarely is it 1:1 as at the end of the day the price is set by what people are willing to buy and sell for and the market does not actually have perfect knowledge nor is completely rational (which this theory requires to be 1:1)"
2021-05-01 15:00:01,stocks,So it's not an automatic adjustment. That's the question.
2021-05-01 16:06:05,stocks,"Indeed, thank you."
2021-05-01 16:22:54,stocks,"This is exactly what I thought, and was also confused about why I got down voted for saying it's not exactly 1:1 (for the reasons you mentioned).

Thanks!"
2021-05-01 15:09:37,stocks,"No. The adjustment is based on a selloff that often happens after the ex-dividend date. What normally happens is that a dividend is announced so people are willing to buy at a higher price and the price typically goes up (usually around the value of the announced dividend). Those that bought specifically for the dividend will eventually sell with a majority selling after record (or the day after ex-dividend). At that point the price goes down since the dividend no longer attracts buyers to the higher price. The fluctuation is based on stock value and expected returns. A special dividend will often be closer to a 1:1 effect than a dividend aristocrat, value stock. I hope this helps."

One of their key points is that ""...after a stock goes ex-dividend, the share price typically drops by the amount of the dividend paid to reflect the fact that new shareholders are not entitled to that payment""

Interesting to me is the word ""typically"", which signals to me that the dip is not an intrinsic, foregone event.  It does make a lot of logical sense that the free cash flow (FCF) is used to pay the dividend thereby lowering the available FCF.  As we know, Discounted FCF is one method of providing a current valuation of the company.  Paying the dividend by default lowers the intrinsic value of the company by reducing FCF, so the stock price goes down.

However, paying dividends back to shareholders, giving them a tangible return on investment, is also one possible signal of health and vitality of company, which would arguably show the company holds value well.

2021-05-01 14:47:49,stocks,I'm a bit confused.  Why would people buy into these Bonds at 0%?
2021-05-01 15:49:05,stocks,"So, I work in capital markets for a living, and I had the same reaction as you did when I saw 0% notes issued as part of a PIPE offering - asking myself ""who the fuck would commit capital/buy notes from SNAP without being compensated for it - especially since they're unsecured notes, meaning your fucked in the event of default? That makes zero sense.""

Until I went and looked in the indenture, and this paper is structured in a way that I'd never really thought about or encountered, since it seems like it functions like a call option with no premium (note holders can convert to equity at their discretion any time over the next six years) but in the legal vehicle similar to a SPAC (if you don't exercise the call option available to buy shares at the current strike price - or in the case of a SPAC, the committed capital isn't deployed via deSPAC merger + IPO - the original notional amount is returned to the public share holders / PIPE entities).

>**In connection with the pricing of the notes, Snap plans to enter into capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes** or their respective affiliates or other financial institutions, collectively, the capped call counterparties. **The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of Snap Class A common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to holders of Snap’s Class A common stock on any conversion of notes** or at Snap’s election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments Snap is required to make in excess of the principal amount of any such converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap.

>In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the capped call counterparties or their respective affiliates may purchase shares of Snap Class A common stock or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Snap Class A common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes. **This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Snap Class A common stock or the notes at that time.**

This lends the impression that this transaction is part of a broader M&A process. I suspect the private buyers of the convertible notes are an M&A target SNAP is looking to scoop up, but instead of further diluting their current shareholders now by issuing new stock to the target, it appears they're delaying that for some time by issuing the converts and effectively deferring the increase to their cost of capital down the road until if/when the notes are exercised and equity is issued.

NGL, pretty clever way of arranging your cap stack, especially when leverage profile isn't a huge concern. Curious to see what further merger details come out of this, since it's almost guaranteed to be related to part of a bigger acquisition / transaction financing.

Should also note that these notes aren't available for the public to purchase. They're a 144A/PIPE private placement with individuals/entities that pass the income/net asset threshold - probably part of the reason why it makes no sense to those of us relying on publicly available data."
2021-05-01 14:15:07,stocks,Are they convertible bonds?
2021-05-01 17:32:06,stocks,"The instrument isn't quite as cut and dried as you portray. It has an element of potential equity participation as the carrot.  

As for SNAP's viability going forward, despite debt and lack of profit, many people may not realize there's been a major shift with respect to SNAP that kicked in about six months ago. 

Before that they were regarded as just another money-losing fad that would go away.  But to the analysts' surprise, SNAP managed to cook up viable plans to attract advertisers, and there's lots of evidence it's working.  They've had a couple of billion dollar quarters, and the inflection point of break even to profitable is coming much sooner than most imagined.  I think (?) SNAP has quietly snuck into third place among social plays.

And even the assumption that ""they're not profitable"" is superficial.  If you dig into the details of recent numbers, they could be profitable however they're putting that money into programs that attract influential content, which supercharges user growth.  And it's apparently working.  So the ""losing money"" stat is misleading, and when looked at from a different perspective, could be considered good news, not bad.  As someone who loaded up on AMZN during the final years of people saying ""but they're not profitable"" (while those people weren't noticing that profit or loss were levers controlled by Amazon) it's a familiar pattern that I find tempting.

As they've aged, it's been noted that SNAP has outlasted multiple projections of their death, by innovating.  They were considered a fad of being the disappearing messages app.  They re-invented to do filters, which continue to be inexplicably popular.  They've re-invented to do stories.  They're re-inventing now as group messaging, which is hot, and experiential, which is perfect for the now rebounding travel advertising segment.  It's becoming harder to bet on SNAP just fading away as had always been assumed.  

SNAP is also considered one of the less harmful type of social media and tech plays.  Where FB is considered pure evil, SNAP is considered benign.  Turns out that's good if you want to sell advertising.  

During this earnings season, SNAP weathered it about the best, compared to peers like FB and PINS.   Maybe next week will be SNAP's turn to get beat down, but so far, so good."

2021-05-01 15:05:03,stocks,"*people* aren't. the entities that bought them through the private placement are going to chop them up and put them in different products they label as investment vehicles. now the liability for default rests with their customers and the entities that sold the products get to pat themselves on the back because it looks like they're serving the investment needs of their customers but they really just gave them dog shit and made a commission off them. 

The bonds themselves act like a call option. I didn't look into what price they get converted into common stock, but basically the company and the entities that subscribed are betting the stock will hit that price and then the bonds get converted into the useless common stock. The common stock, mind you, has no voting rights, the company does not pay a dividend, and you get $0.00001/share if the company goes under, if you get anything. So the company already stripped its common stock of everything other than its ability to function as a speculative instrument. 

And I'll die on this hill, Snapchat is dated technology and really only is trading as high as it is because of its ability to aggregate political campaign spending. Once the world's attention span shifts to whatever will become Snapchat's successor, the investors that gave this company billions upon billions of dollars will just be out of it all, with nothing from the company but a middle finger. All it will take is for one of the sides of the political aisle to just say ""you know what Snapchat isn't doing it for me."" Then their competitors will immediately follow because one side is only on there because the other one is.

How much time, if Snapchat actually grows by that much, will it take for the company's *retained earnings*, not revenue, not net income, but the money they end up stashing away, to cover an $8 billion accumulated deficit?

All of these instruments would be ok with me if Snapchat paid as much interest as a person who is inundated with student loans pays on a car, something like 16%, because it's the human equivalent of what Snap is doing. But 0%? Who the fuck gets 0% anywhere on anything?"

2021-05-01 19:46:50,stocks,"You and I can't buy the convertible notes SNAP issued - it's a 144A offering (Private Investment in Public Equity), so it was privately negotiated with (an) accredited investor(s). Basically, these sort of transactions prevent you from having to registering the notes with the SEC, so it saves you a ton of time, money, and headaches if you're the issuer (SNAP).

Tech isn't the sector that I cover, so I'm not sure if this is normal or typical in the context of a public tech acquireror buying out a private target.....but it *looks* like it's part of a larger transaction, likely part of a larger acquisition involving a private target (e.g. SNAP likely was negotiating with some sponsor-backed private company, which means effectively negotiating with a PE/VC firm). 

Gives the PE shop/PrivateCo a real option to exercise between now and May 1, 2027 and it delays SNAP from having to further dilute their public shareholders (and increasing their cost of capital by doing so).

[Also, looks like SNAP is presenting investor decks on Monday and Tuesday](https://imgur.com/a/KlNWKhl) of this week......if this is all related to an acquisition, I imagine we'll find out before the market opens on Monday."

The gradual phasing out of gas-powered vehicles and infusion of electric or clean-energy vehicles doesn't imply *growth* of the automotive industry, just an evolution of it. I anticipate that there won't be some wave of exuberance that compels all consumers to dump their gas-powered cars for EVs all at once, thereby leaving any car manufacturer not already steeped in clean-energy in the dust forever. People also seem to forget that most of the largest car makers already have clean-energy vehicles for sale---it's not as if people can't buy them yet. I guess for investors looking forward with growth in mind, they might try to anticipate how market share will change as the gradual evolution happens. I personally think that the window for opportunity for the largest players is a lot smaller than people realize, however. 20 years from now, I would estimate that there will likely be just about as many Toyotas, VWs, Hondas, Hyundais, Fords, and GMs on the road as there are currently. I don't think there will be all that much change in the share as there is from year to year already.

LOL no way. not gonna happen. no way that all cars will be EV. more cars? yes. all cars? no. 20% of American EV buyers go back to gas cars because charging EVs is a pain in the butt. https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/1-in-5-electric-vehicle-owners-in-california-switched-back-to-gas-because-charging-their-cars-is-a-hassle-new-research-shows/ar-BB1gekKk

EVs have serious problems in cold weather: the batteries drain faster, and need to be charged 2x as much as in warmer climates. we are decades away from widespread EV use in places like Chicago that are bitterly cold half the year. forget about Alaska. 

recently on Jack Hough's Streetwise podcast, the head of BorgWarner, a major auto component manufacturer, estimates by 2030 or 2040 about 1/3d of cars in American will be EV, 1/3d hybrid and 1/3d traditional. that strikes me as a much more realistic forecast. nationwide, EVs are about 2% of vehicle sales. even if they sold 10x as much over the next decade, that's still a minority of all cars."

There is one upside though and that’s higher margins. EVs have the opportunity to have much, much better margins than traditional autos, at least in the short-mid term before the race to the bottom when all legacy auto has their own EVs. 

Though most legacy automakers are still struggling to even turn a profit on EVs today, in the future they should easily see 20%+ margins even for the least efficient automakers."
2021-05-01 16:31:41,stocks,"I definitely agree with your sentiment.  Many people don't even realize the electric version just means changing the complex ICE engine and supporting parts for... complex electric motor(s) and supporting parts.  

The bet on some is that they'll individually benefit from the transition.  Let's consider Ford.  They are now in the position of year-plus waiting lists, when they've traditionally been unable to give their cars away.  On top of that, they're on a new trajectory of being more selective about where and what they sell, with profit being the driving factor.  They've ruthlessly abandoned the unprofitable markets.  

Their one successful product line has been pickup trucks, because they can price them at double the MSRP of cars even though they don't cost that much more to make.  Making the trucks electric has allowed them to jack up the price premium even higher.  CEO just claimed it gives the truck more power ( which I'd like to see data on) and versatility, citing examples of Ford truck owners who used the onboard generators during the blackouts.  

Ford is also getting some business producing electric cargo vans and things they otherwise wouldn't.  

There's also the assumption that EV sales will incorporate greasy and greedy software and subscription revenues.  Like the way Tesla makes owners pay thousands to remove the software block on seat heaters.  Or the way Ford already makes owners pay for the maps and linkage to your phone.  It's an assumption that this lucrative scheme will expand.

All that said, everyone is making a case why their favorite car company will be the one that gets all these boosts, but they can't all win.  At some point there will have to be a shakeout or rationalization."
2021-05-01 17:02:05,stocks,"VW has a room to grow because they are recovering from deiselgate, they went heavy into electric, cutting almost all forms of motorsport they were involved in (a lot of r&d is done there). They have the biggest factories in the world so possibly can reach economies of scale faster. EVs are still expensive, but if they can offer a good range at the same cost as current cars, they will be set for the future. 

At least that's my thinking behind VW anyway.

I also think the EV push is coming at the same time as the 'smart tech' push in the car world, thanks to Tesla I suppose. It's the next market tech companies are looking at, and thinking of getting involved, could be a lot of potential. Doesn't just have to be auto driving. With EV cars charging might take 30mins+ so there's a whole avenue of things a car didn't need to do before that could be added for comfort, and 'smartness'.

EVs are and will continue to be subsidized by various world governments - some because they depend on oil from other countries and EVs reduce their imports and strengthen their place in the world (China) while others need to keep up to make sure that those countries do not take their market share (US) while others actually give a fuck about the environment (some Europe).

Consider a battery pack and 2 motors versus an engine, transmission, exhaust system, radiator, alternator/distributor, etc. 

It’s WAY cheaper to manufacture and maintain. 

Some comments here are just blanket saying “young people drive less”. Agree, but the size of the global car market is titanic compared to EV market share. Even if you cut the entire worlds car market in half overnight, EVs have millions of units a year of growth.

2021-05-01 16:58:15,stocks,"Glad someone else here is saying it.  

There's this huge misperception that science and manufacturers have quietly invented new and magic battery capabilities.  They haven't.  There's actually been no noteworthy progress at all.  People just told themselves ten years ago ""oh science and industry will make rapid progress"" and then they closed their eyes, woke up today and assumed it must have all happened.  Except it hasn't.  

Batteries become useless at cold temperatures, and will self destruct if not kept warm. Tesla uses the battery's own juice to run electric heaters to keep itself warm overnight.  If that runs out, it uses the last of the power to send a flag to Tesla that you've been careless with your battery and voids your warranty.  That's not innovation.  

We're in the honeymoon phase where everyone is enjoying their EV's first battery.  But unlike ICE engines, batteries age and die whether you use them or not.  Replacing a battery will be a costly headache.  Those people you know enjoying their 20 year old Toyota, Honda, or Ford truck that's on its first power train?  EV batteries can't do that.  And those 20 year old workhorses with the original engine?  They've had to replace the battery five times along the way.  No amount of pampering and preventive maintenance can avoid the fact that batteries eat themselves to death.

And the other huge point you didn't mention is that our electric grid has no ability to support EV's.  Expecting every home and parking lot to suddenly support 5000-10,000 watts of simultaneously overnight charging is a pipe dream.  Our grid already falls apart on warm days or cold nights.  

The unspoken Achilles heel of EV's is that electric system upgrades will be required BEFORE EV's can see mass adoption.  

And since I know our infrastructure can't/won't be rebuilt for that, I'm better that individual power generation (solar/wind) and (especially) storage will be required first.  Essentially I'm saying that those who want a garage with two EV's will need to add some cogeneration and energy storage.  

That's why I'm investing in STEM for the long term.  

And for the short term, my opinion on battery technology (above) is why I'm investing in Micro-Vast.  They're sort of the Walmart of EV batteries, but the auto industry is going to be demanding tons of regular, non-futuristic batteries immediately, and they're well poised for that.

2021-05-01 15:24:49,stocks,"Yea I get the whole self driving craze as well but again, if people are renting cars not buying them then the number of cars per capita would decrease compared to the current number right? Companies like uber will also want their share of the market (will bulk purchase vehicles at a lower unit cost) and people are not going to pay more money than the current taxi model just because the car drives itself... 

Car manufacturers can change their business model all they want but I just don't see one being more profitable than the current model with mass production of personal use vehicles. They are changing because they have to not because they want to."

The local VW dealership can offer me the same old vehicles they always have. Their ""green"" products are diesels, which would be hard to trust given VW's corrupt history.

I don't doubt that in the US GM and Ford probably offer more options than VW, just as in Europe I don't believe GM and Ford even have any EVs while VW offers a variety. The main point is not necessarily what these companies are doing today, but what they're doing for the future. VW is clearly taking EVs very seriously, investing $118B in EVs vs GM's $27B and Ford's $29B.

This already shows in the trends, where VW saw a 315% increase in EV sales in 2020 (although this was also partially due to a big new product release with the ID3). With GM's and Ford it's almost impossible to find their EV sales numbers as they seem to be trying desperately to keep them hidden, but what is known is that GM BEV and PHEV sales went down by 4% in 2020 despite selling the cheapest EV in the world, while Ford's numbers went up 154%, but 90%+ of their sales were PHEVs. These two brands like to pretend they're completely on board the EV hype train, but in reality they know they're too late to make the switch and go through multiple years of unprofitability with their terrible balance sheet without going bankrupt.

> If you're talking about their association with QS, keep in mind QS has a theory that's at the lab stage, and even if it's real, it's minimum five years away and likely much, much longer than that. And during that five to fifteen year incubation period, everyone else that makes and uses batteries will be making their own progress.

Quantumscape is vaporwear, at least in the short to mid-term. Solid state batteries will be in technological lock-in for at least 5-10 years before it can catch up with lithium, and that's only if someone's willing to invest insane amounts of money to scale it up to mass production. I think investing in them was just a marketing stunt by VW.

> I'm sure there's lots about VW that I'd don't know so please share. I'm just relating what it's like real world for someone going to buy a vehicle here today, and that is that Ford/GM are further along the way than VW in North America.

I don't doubt that this is the case at the moment in the US, but we need to look a few years out.

And either way, ultimately VW, GM and Ford are all headed for some very tough times for the simple reason that they started the transition too late, their investors won't allow their companies to go through a period of unprofitability which is required to transition from 99% ICE vehicles to 100% EVs with high enough margins to make money (currently they're still losing money, while Tesla already has comparable margins to their ICE vehicles), and because they're still using dealerships that will refuse to promote EVs because there's almost no money to make from EV maintenance and they don't have the expertise to provide service on the software/technology part of the EVs."

2021-05-01 19:45:25,stocks,They tried to scrap petrol and diesel in the late 90s also and early 2000s.
2021-05-01 16:44:13,stocks,"Well actually, electric F150 is allowing them to jack up their already outrageous MSRP and margins on their most overpriced and massively sold product.  I believe a figure I'd heard estimated was 30%.  In a segment that lives and dies on a percentage point at a time, 30% is huge."
2021-05-01 15:16:48,stocks,"Trust me, when the Electric F150 comes out sales will double, there will be people buying F150's that never owned one.. do you know how many construction companies are gonna grab those up to save cost and tax write offs for EV vehicles???

2021-05-01 18:49:08,stocks,Something I pointed out to my more skeptical family members is that many of them have spent *thousands* of dollars over the years engine repairs. And it was never looked at as anything other than normal cost of business when it comes to owning an automobile... So if in a couple years I have to drop the battery and get a new one installed for a couple thousand dollars I will still be coming in way under what many of them have spent in the same time frame on their gasoline engines and drive trains.
2021-05-01 18:59:11,stocks,"That's true. I guess the key is to swap out the old batteries with better/more advanced ones that means they drive further. That would most likely mean that they would be worth more. Also, I don't think people are aware of how much cheaper an electric car is to run and maintain, so that isn't included in their price."

2021-05-01 17:45:40,stocks,"Disclaimer: I'm not a drugs person nor pharma person in any way.

I think you (or I) might be misunderstanding these.  Supposedly the medical application of these psychedelics is so tiny as to be non-intoxicating and virtually unnoticeable.  

There are claims that they have astounding benefits on diseases for which current medicine and pharmaceuticals have been useless.  Those claims need to be rigorously tested.  

But in the meantime, and in the stages which happen *before* those efficacy tests, there's safety testing.  And my understanding is that micro-doses of these things have been about as safe as safe can be, with virtually no harm found.  

While they may or may not be effective on the diseases, I think they're well on the way to establishing they aren't going to hurt you.  I guess there's the chance you hurt your wallet if you buy them and they don't cure your PSTD or whatever, but again, that's about efficacy, not safety.

To me, the worst case scenario is they end up being like acupuncture, where there's debate over whether it works, but full acceptance that it's not going to hurt you."

2021-05-01 13:30:59,stocks,"the market will **always** crash eventually. there's a ~20% drop an average of every 2 years (plus or minus). and in the last century there have been about half a dozen occasions where there was a 50% drop. but it always recovers, usually within a few years. 

sitting around waiting for the crash is a fool's errand. investing steadily, through the ups & downs, is the key to building wealth.   

but if you're super-nervous about it, you could invest a healthy chunk of the portfolio in something like a low-volatility fund/ETF that's less likely to have dramatic swings up & down, or invest in options that have more reasonable valuations (lots of foreign markets, or value funds/ETFs, are trading at 10-15x earnings rather than 50-100x like the hot sectors of the US market). or you could sit on a larger cash position, maybe ~20% or something (I made that up that %, not a rigorous analysis)."

2021-05-01 14:06:14,stocks,"So...the thing about market crashes, whether major or minor, is that it always recovers eventually. Unless you're worried about a complete economic collapse, in which case, why is your money in stocks in the first place? If you're that level of paranoid, use your money to create an off the grid self sustaining homestead.

Now, I could see making a case for moving the majority of one's assets out of stocks, when worried about a market crash if you're planning on retiring next year or so, something like that. Maybe into short term bonds, or into real estate, which can also crash, but you can live on rental income in the meantime, until the market recovers.

But if you're a young buck, what are you worried about? So what if the market crashes? In fact, I hope I see a major market crash in my young years. Buy a ton when the market is down and out and wait for recovery. More millionares are made during market crashes than prosperity."
2021-05-01 14:52:38,stocks,"If your not willing to lose 20% tomorrow and 40% in a month over something novel or stupid, this isn't for you.   We haven't seen sustained inflation and might not so i'm highly skeptical of bad inflation and think hyper inflation is a comically low risk.  There are alot of reasons why the economy with soak up the cash without inflation,  but it's alot of cash so many outcomes are on the table.  People have predicted inflation since the Clinton administration and Economists prediting 15 of the last 3 recession.  Never think of investing as an all or nothing, If your worried pull some cash, diversify your portfolio into lower risk companies/etfs or  take 2% of your money and buy some put options for the time frame you're worried about."
2021-05-01 13:18:31,stocks,"No one can really predict a market crash before it happens. There are a lot of indications that we're in an asset bubble right now, but it's anyone's guess when or if it will burst, and how bad it could be. 

My current strategy is to play stocks conservatively. People talk of pulling everything out and waiting, but it's worth noting that bubbles can grow and grow for years before the inevitable happens. Even if you think the market will crash, it's probably not a bad idea to hedge against the prospect that you could be wrong. 

I watched an interview on Bloomberg recently that explains the market bear sentiment pretty informatively [here.](https://youtu.be/RYfmRTyl56w)"

We literally just had a market crash last March as well. It bounced right back up to normal

Whenever there’s a crash, there will always be people who buy in in large numbers because the prices are low. Then it just goes up again."
2021-05-01 13:14:43,stocks,"If you are concerned about inflation you could invest in assets that tend to do good in inflationary environments? Fixed cost investments like real estate, or assets with pricing power, such as commodity producers. Similarly you may want to avoid retailers or (none life) insurance, that usually doesn’t do so hot.

A healthy mix is probably the best approach. 

Btw a weak currency is usually good for export companies since they become more competitive as it’s cheaper for others to buy their goods. Importers are screwed though.

You should also invest outside of the US. If the US experience hyper inflation (which I highly doubt will happen) everyone is boned, but the US will be the most boned."

2021-05-01 13:04:02,stocks,"I'm in your situation and I decided to proceed like that:

I'll wait till a bear market will come (interest rates/inflation and so on).

That won't be a 7 to 10% correction. We are talking between 40 and 75%. Looking at historic trends, fair value for the s&p 500 is far below 3,000, much closer to 2,000 if not less, if it were not for all of the Fed intervention they have done over the last 12 years. Growth stocks like Tesla will get absolutely annihilated. Every stock will get hurt, but the only ones that won't get completely destroyed are the ones that are going to be continuing to turn out huge profits, like McDonald's and Walmart. The stock market will abandon speculation in growth and run to value.

well yes, did you come to this conclusion when you heard the fed say we're under their goals for inflation and theyll take steps to hit those goals?

or for interest rates, when they said they expect to raise them as things return to normal?

neither means a crash will or will not occur

Youve basically said nothing of value here. Markets always are near / at ATH, fed aims for a moderate amount of inflation as that makes debt favorable and interest rates are tied to inflation and move as part of how they handle inflation.

Ex Dividend Date is the date you need to have OWNED the shares. Buy them BEFORE this date. If you buy them ON this date, I believe that won’t count.

There is a separate Pay Date. Depending on the stock you own it could be yearly, quarterly, or monthly.

If I ever wonder about specific dates and also to look at past dates I just google “XYZ dividend history” and the first result every time is the NASDAQ website.

Example ORC:
[ORC Dividend History](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/orc/dividend-history)

Declaration Date is the date they announced the dividend.

Ex/EFF Date is the date you MUST OWN this stock. Buy BEFORE this date.

Payment Date is when you get paid based on what you owned on the Ex Date.

Cash Amount is the amount you’ll be paid per share.


I like this site because gives you a history and how consistent they’ve been and the amount it’s been paid at.


One fun thing to know - is AFTER the Ex Date you can sell those shares and still get the dividend. Make sure you sell AFTER that date though. But be careful as the stock does reduce in price due to the dividend payout. So maybe wait a week or two if you think it’ll continue to grow but want to drop the stock."
2021-05-01 12:14:40,stocks,You have to own the stock before the ex dividend date to receive the dividend on the pay date. If you buy on the exdividend date then the previous owner receives the dividend. Just use Google and check the nasdaq site.
2021-05-01 14:25:19,stocks,"For all intents and purposes, think of the ex-dividend date as the date the company pulls the cash out and sets it aside to pay the next dividend and it begins trading with no declared dividend on that date. 

The key date in terms of receiving that dividend, or not, is the record date, which is usually one day after the ex-dividend date. If you have *settled* shares of the stock on the record date, you are entitled to that dividend payment even if you sell your shares before that dividend is paid.

Since stocks in the US are T+2 settlement, you would need to execute your purchase of the stock the day before the ex-dividend date. That way, it will have settled by close of business on the record date and you will receive that dividend.

Ex: company declares a dividend with ex-date of 2/15, record date of 2/16, and pay date of 3/15. You would need to purchase the shares on, or before, 2/14 to receive that dividend. If you purchased on 2/15 or later, you would not receive the 3/15 dividend payment."

I mean,  if you want the first dividend,  then sure,  buy before the Ex date,  but if you're looking at buying close to that day then I think you're better off waiting and let it drop by the amount of the dividend and you keep the cash immediately (no taxes either).  Doesn't make sense to buy a few days before and then wait a month to get the cash back."

2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Let's talk Lumber Gang! Bullish on $BCC and $LPX. Bearish on Home Builders. First DD about something I'm familiar with.

I am currently in FAANG tickers plus MSFT. Earnings were good but the stock is either not moving, or went up and came back down. I’m planning to sell everything I’m green in and move the majority over to something that has been killing it which is lumber. It can add some more variety to this sub.

My husband is in the industry (his company is not publicly traded) and things have been good and bad. It’s been good because people have been paying ridiculous prices for houses. Combine that with the building material shortage and he has been able to raise his profit margins. Very nice commission checks coming home.

It’s bad because there is not enough lumber for everyone and he’s been having hard conversations with builders who don’t get that they will have to slow down because product is running out.

Here are how lumber futures have been doing.

5 Day – 9.45%

1 Month – 48.41%

3 Month – 69.36%

YTD – 72.15%

1 Year – 359.39%

If anyone knows how to invest in futures without receiving actual product I would love to know. Don’t want to be that guy that got a bunch of oil delivered to him.

With how things are going we are going to continue to see a rise in lumber for at least through the summer. The biggest problem is obtaining Engineered Wood Products (EWP) and OSB. Home Depot has quadrupled the price of OSB over the past year. There is also a resin shortage that is needed to make these products. Timber is cheap but the bottleneck is sawmills. Either they have reduced capacity due to covid or they are switching business to OSB because it is more profitable.

I’m looking at companies such as $BCC (38% last 3 months), $WY (23% last 3 months), $LPX (71% last 3 months). They have had great runs and are currently in a dip from the last few days. (Hopefully a dip and not the top).

First companies that will be screwed sooner than later will most likely be home builders. They will soon realize they have been building houses for free and will get hit first. They try to hit a 35% profit margin. That margin is eroding by rising costs but they are under contract. Contracts last about 6 months. So expect their profits to go down. Unless they have been really good at guessing lumber futures and buying appropriately.

Home builders have been hitting highs and could be shorted or have puts placed on them. Just look at the top 10 list of publicly traded developer stocks. Be careful with timing. They’ve had big jumps this last week.

Bear case: The fed could finally raise interest rates which would decrease demand and let supply catch up. More investment can go into building out saw mills. Builders can get creative and use different materials. This is where steel gang can benefit. Supply could eventually catch up but it may take some time. This is a several month play for now.

Current position is shares in $BCC. I've seen nice steady rise over the last few months.

TLDR: Lumber has been on a great run and is getting more scarce. Buy lumber tickers such as $BCC, $WY and $LPX and puts on big home developers. Mid term play."

I doubt mills are going to make capital investments on increased output when according to [FRED data,](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU28000003132110001A) employment of sawmill workers is at historical lows (other states with available data like OR and WA are similar), which implies either they've been divesting production capacity or they have the machines, but not the employees.

Well, yes. Because they've had monster earnings. They're nowhere near highs they've seen previously in 2008. Material and labor shortages notwithstanding, the good ones are only just getting started. The housing market shows no signs of slowing down, and is in a secular growth trend as a new generation is settling into homebuying. In fact, except for a few like GRBK, most haven't run that much higher than their pre covid highs.

Let me explain;

Say i have $20k to invest.

I looked at a random stock list on Finviz of those that pay dividends. One of these is MPLX.

Even better, it looks like it takes place this week. According to a press release last week, it says this;

*"" The board of directors of the general partner of MPLX LP (NYSE: MPLX) has declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.6875 per common unit for the first quarter of 2021, or $2.75 on an annualized basis. The distribution will be paid on May 14, 2021, to common unitholders of record as of May 7, 2021.""*

The dividen yield is 10% but I dunno if this is good or not. I've heard IBM is a good stock for this, but I really don't get it. 

So, does this mean, that anyone who holds stock before May 7th, gets the cash payment dividend on May 14th? I know my broker automatically gives me the dividend as I've had a couple in the past, for a few dollars. 

Assuming this is true, if you went and bought 740 shares on Monday, this would cost you just shy of $20,000 ($26.99 per share).

Does this mean, that by the 7th that valuation would be eligible and on the 14th you'd get paid the dividend? 

Next, assuming that is correct, how do you work it out? It says 0.68 per common unit, so does this mean they will give you 0.68 per share, which based on the 740 puchase share example, 0.68x740 = 503.2 (so $503.20 dollars). So if you invest on the Monday, hold until the 14th, you get 500 dollars for putting that 20,000 dollars in?

Is this right or am I chatting nuts? It also says this is quarterly, so you can expect something similar every 3 months, so $2000 a year just for putting the money in?

Assuming this is right, what's to stop people investing in the week before, then pulling everything out when the money gets paid? Nothing I assume? 

And lastly, if all the above is correct, does anyone know some long term growth stocks that would be stable for large investment that also pay a handsome dividend?"

2021-05-01 09:46:24,stocks,If you cash out after a dividend payout before owning for i think 61 days it will be taxed as a capital gain. If its a MLP you have to file those wonderful K1 forms. Dividends  are for long term investments.
2021-05-01 10:50:21,stocks,"I've taken up dividend investing in the past few months, here's what I know so far:

1) if you hold a share before the ex-dividend date, you are eligible to get a dividend payout from that stock

2) dividends come from the company's profits- they are removed from the stock price, but not covered as a loss. So in your example (simplifying down to owning 1 share) of you have a share that is $27, that pays out 68 cents a share, you end up with a share that costs $26.32, and 68 cents off free spending money, and your brokerage shouldn't be showing that position in the red.

3) there are 5 types of dividend payout; weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. They pay out 52, 12, 4, 2, and 1 time per year, respectively.
These can happen at any date/day.

4) the strategy you described to but, qualify, then sell is a used tactic, but it's not really sustainable. There's several videos on it and it's problems. Because a lower price leads to more shares being scooped up, the share price tends to bounce back after dividend payment, so it's usually a better strategy just to hold onto your investment until you hear news that gives you an indication to sell.

5) look for companies in the dividend aristocrats/ kings list; companies like T, VZ, MO, KMB, XOM, O, MAIN, AFL, and CVX have 4-7% dividend yields, while also increasing their dividend payout so the longer you hold a position the more it makes for you.

Side advice: Don't chase yield, chase companies with stability that have a history of increasing dividends at a high rate. I'd rather have $1000 in AAPL than $1000 in a company with a 14% yield that'll crash in a month. The only accepting to that are a few ETFs out there that do covered calls, they're very stable and barely change in value, but pay out roughly 10-12%, they're not growth companies but they do pay monthly and can be good compounders; QYLD and RYLD are the 2 I'm invested in.

Of course, make sure to do your own research and only buy into companies you like.

If you have any other questions feel free to ask em."
2021-05-01 10:20:54,stocks,">does anyone know some long term growth stocks that would be stable for large investment that also pay a handsome dividend?

Growth stocks usually don't pay dividends because they use that cash to grow the company, while mature businesses that don't need that much cash to grow, or where the growth opportunities are limited, would rather pay dividends or buy back stock.

Also, the dividend yield of a stock is directly related to its risk. For example Tobacco stocks have a high dividend yield because it is a declining industry and investors anticipate that the dividend could not be sustainable in the future.

Check the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats for a list of companies that have increased dividends every year for at least the last 25 years."
2021-05-01 09:33:20,stocks,The dividend comes out of the stock price. So if it trades for 20.04 and pays 4 cent dividend it will open at 20.00 the next day
2021-05-01 09:38:00,stocks,"So a couple things - 1. Stocks trade with “due-bills” this means that you do not need to be the holder on the record date that if you buy the stock before the ex-date you will receive the distribution 2. In terms of straight math - you’d get 68c on each of your 740 shares - but this isn’t really just “free money” - there is a lot of debate about it, but technically if a stock pays a 68c dividend than on that day it SHOULD trade 68c lower (ex-dividend)... so you wouldn’t really be making that money because you’d then sell your stock for 68c less. Now whether or not this is realized there is a lot of academic papers and studies on it . But if you think markets are large liquid stocks are relatively efficient then you know the dividends are priced in such that someone can’t really Arb the dividend in the way you’re talking about 

And yea quarterly = dividend every quarter"
2021-05-01 09:55:20,stocks,"1: when looking at dividends, as others have correctly mentioned, it should be added that dividends dont “come out of the stock price” but rather it comes from cash which affects the price of the stock. 

2: MLPs are great but risky. They are usually more speculative given the nature of the corporate structure and their intended purpose. That is, a gas pipeline MLP will at one point exhaust itself and the share price will decline, the pipeline shuts down due to commodity prices making it not profitable, and so on. So, one has to do a tremendous amount of research to see if it sits well in your portfolio. A nice mix is ok, but id still be cautious."
2021-05-01 11:28:21,stocks,"the dividend comes out of the share price. 

dividends are fine as part an overall portfolio, or long-term plan. but dividends are terrible as a short-term strategy. 

long-term, most dividend paying companies will see their share price recover or hold steady. so it's fine if they pay out X% every year. but if you cash out too soon, you have zero net gain. buy at $10, they pay a 5% dividend ... you cash out and have $9.50 + $.50 = $10. 

a lot of the stock market's overall growth comes from re-invested dividends, or if you're retired and want to generate pretty steady income from dividend stocks that's also good. but you literally gain nothing by buying and cashing out a week later just to get the dividend."
2021-05-01 09:38:06,stocks,"You are correct in all your assumptions, but the share price drops by the dividend amount so you could not pull out right away for profit, that being said, most div stocks will rebound to the level prior to the div ex date within a couple weeks so technically yes you could purchase before, and sell a month after to gain the profit.

What you described is called dividend chasing, it’s difficult to do if you can’t monitor the market constantly and get out at the right time to reallocate to another div stock."
2021-05-01 09:55:58,stocks,"A share will down in value once it’s dividend has been paid all else being equal, it’s not possible to make money off this consistently. This is also why if you look at the Indexes of some global share markets like Australian or Britain it looks like they’ve been very flat for years when in reality they’ve been yielding 4-6% dividends across the index whereas the US is sub 2%. Higher dividends = flatter share price that will go down after dividends are paid."
2021-05-01 10:29:48,stocks,"As others mentioned, the stock price will drop by the amount of the dividend, essentially cancelling it out.  Then you are gambling that the stock price will return to its original value shortly after.  e.g. You are taking the risk that you aren’t paying a dollar to make a dime."
2021-05-01 11:38:55,stocks,"I've considered it too, but honestly the return is very small. To experiment, I bought 5 shares of O and then set a limit order to sell on the exdiv date for my cost basis. I made $1.00 in div and $1.50 because it executed about my sell price. A lot of work for $2.50 (and $1.50 was basically from a swing trade anyway).  


If you're going to chase small profit from short holds, you'd probably be better off day/swing trading anyway."
2021-05-01 12:44:06,stocks,LB Lbrands just announced a few months ago they are reinstating their dividend. 100% a growth stock right now but it's in the s&p500 and def isn't going anywhere besides $80 minimum by summer.
2021-05-01 13:13:51,stocks,"I have tried this a few times, and what I find is (as others have echoed) it often isn't worth the effort. There isn't always (in the current market) a correlation between stock price dropping and EX Dividend dates, but I think in my experience so far I would end up ahead just dropping the money in a long term stock. 

The other challenge I've found is that once I buy and then sell the stock, it takes a few days for the money to clear, so I could get pinged with a good faith violation and/or miss a good opportunity because the money is tied up."
2021-05-01 14:29:53,stocks,"Well I mean....basically. but honestly, I suggest finding a dip, buying in, and just holding the stock. Time in the market vs timing the market and all that. Statistically, you're unlikely to beat typical market return by jumping in and out all the time, so what's all that work and tracking for? Just make sure to pick stable stocks with a proven track record. Better yet look into ETFs; returns are sometimes lower but the established ones tend to be more stable. Or real estate reits. Unlike stocks that can end their dividends at any time, reits are required by law to return something like 90% of profits to shareholders.

But yes, dividends are basically free money. Reinvest those dividends and congratulations, you've discovered the wonder of compounding interest. Better yet, if you're Roth eligible, hold those dividend stocks in a Roth IRA and as long as you only make qualified withdrawals, not a dime of those returns are taxable. (But you pay taxes on principle invested current year)."

2021-05-01 13:11:46,stocks,"One point to clarify. Its not exactly right that dividends come out of profit. Dividends come out of retained earnings, which do come from profit. The difference is mostly semantic, but does clarify why share price drops with dividend, since both are shareholder equity."
2021-05-01 10:07:12,stocks,"Ugh, what?  I don't think it's necessarily 1 to 1 like that.

2021-05-01 15:07:21,stocks,Actually no. Net income - dividend payout = retained earnings which is then added to shareholders equity.
2021-05-01 10:09:37,stocks,"“Understanding Dividends
Price Implications
When a dividend is paid, several things can happen. The first of these are changes to the price of the security and various items tied to it. On the ex-dividend date, the stock price is adjusted downward by the amount of the dividend by the exchange on which the stock trades.”

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/dividend_implications.asp

2021-05-01 12:01:13,stocks,Mathematically it should but most times in the real world it’s not one to one like that but still pretty close 🙂
2021-05-01 10:12:04,stocks,"""Generally speaking, stock prices are reduced by the amount of a dividend once the ex-dividend date arrives. However, a variety of other factors can also affect price.

Stock market specialists will mark down the price of a stock on its ex-dividend date by the amount of the dividend. For example, if a stock trades at $50 per share and pays out a $0.25 quarterly dividend, the stock will be marked down to open at $49.75 per share.

However, the market is guided by many other forces. If a stock is deemed to be undervalued by investors, the stock price may be bid up, even on the ex-dividend date. Similarly, if investor perception of the value of a stock on any given day sours, the stock may sell off much more than the simple drop due to the dividend.""

I will get either blank looks, or dire warnings that about losing all my money. Even many of my younger friends don’t have a clue. They don’t make enough to function well, never mind think about saving and investing. You really can only talk about stocks if you find someone with equal passion.

2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results! **Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it’s justified, given their clickbait titles or “5 can't miss stocks of the century” or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,

>If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it’s that Motley Fool is utter trash

Now that that’s out of the way, let’s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool’s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X’ed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.

Basically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**

**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.

**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.

a. One-Quarter

b. One Year

c. Two Year

d. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)

Another feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday’s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).

**Results:**

**Performance of Motely Fool Premium Recommendations** 

|**Avg. Change In Price**|**Motley Fool Stock Picks**|**SPY**|**Change over SPY**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Quarter|6%|3%|3%|
|One Year|24%|11%|13%|
|Two Year|67%|20%|47%|
|Till Date|134%|71%|63%|

 As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool’s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \~2X and two-year returns were \~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark. 

**Performance of Motely Fool Sell Recommendations** 

&#x200B;

|**Avg. Change In Price**|**Motley Fool Stock Picks**|
|:-|:-|
|If you followed Fool's Sell Recommendations|134%|
|If you did not follow Fool's Sell Recommendations|167%|

But it’s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla’s 2020 rally.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**

The stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.

**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool’s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.

But I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.

>We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011

**Conclusion:**

I have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it’s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.

Whatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.

2021-05-01 10:22:02,stocks,"I find that the Motley Fool use the wrong benchmark.  They recommend mostly Tech companies, if they were to compare apples to apples, I think they should use the NASDAQ, which is more tech heavy. I wonder what it would compare to the NASDAQ over the last decade or so. 

Regardless of this, I find that the subsciption oays for itself in knowledge, especially the motley fool live shows that they do monday-friday (I think this is MF US only). Also, I like their Forums, which some contain lots of knowledge."
2021-05-01 14:19:02,stocks,"If you just use them to get leads and then do your DD on them they are definitely useful.  They usually recommend solid companies with lots of future growth it’s up to you to figure out what a good entry point is.  Long term 3-5 years like they suggest maybe that’s not that important either.  

I’m trying to think about some of the companies I’ve looked into since I joined.  Shopify, Nvidia, Crowdstrike, Tesla, Amazon, Disney (before the Disney plus numbers hit) Taiwan semi conductor (before the chip shortage) Blizzard, Bandwidth, there were a lot more but these were the ones I either researched or bought shares of and during that time most of these beat any of the indexes

PS. Most of their picks are well known on Reddit already"
2021-05-01 10:20:40,stocks,"Motley Fool is not a scam, but it's almost there. Their Stock Advisor service can honestly be useful, but their marketing tactics are so sketchy. They will constantly try to upsell you their other usually more expensive and much less value-for-money plans. They will use tricks like establishing time limits to pressure you into buying without thinking. If you have a strong mind, then it might be probably fine. 

In addition, Motley Fool goes for growth stocks, most of which are tech based, so QQQ or some weightes combination of QQQ and SPY may be a better benchmark if you want a more accurate comparison. Their investment returns look a lot worse when we compare them to QQQ or ARK Invest's funds which also focus on tech growth stocks for the most part. So if you want to invest with that style, there are other options.

Lastly, I was always curious about the returns of Tom Gardner vs David Gardner. If I remember correctly, David had like a 3x higher return than Tom (typo edited) and Tom had like a 3x higher return since the S&P. Would make for a good comparison to see the breakdown of the stocks between the two."

MF tends to be tech heavy, so it makes me wonder how they fared against NASDAQ as opposed to SP500?

Also, how do they fare against other recommendation services like Zacks? 

I have seen several people who swear by MF recommendations over the past and some who absolutely hate them for their click bait marketing/upselling and cross-selling the same stocks as multiple products. 

Forget the spamming for a second, is there a hater who can prove that MF recommendations did NOT give good returns over time? Is spamming the only complaint? I mean, if they are helping you make money, why not tolerate some spamming?

Regardless, lovers gonna love and haters gonna hate. But, I haven’t come across a post yet the recommends an alternate service to MF that promises decent returns. In other words, who do the haters recommend? Are you able to provide us with an equally awesome analysis/insight into the performance of competitors so we can determine who else performs as good as them if not better?"
2021-05-01 09:36:58,stocks,"Nice try. Not falling for this. 

I got lured in to MF Due to their aggressive advertising. Being a noob I caved in for a basic 108$ plan. Immediately they tried to upsell me to a more expensive plan. 

They spam the shit out of my email.
Now coming to how their shit works, when you sign up they suggest you 15 stocks and will suggest you to put equal amounts of money in all those 15 tickers rn and keep adding on to them for longterm. 
Sounds good right ?
Fucking no. Soon they will start sending emails for buy suggestions for tickers that are not there on the earlier list. Let’s say they send 4-5 tickers. Cut to next week they will send another 4-5 tickers( some of them may be old and some brand new ) and they continue to do so. Soon you will end up with around 35 tickers in a month. WTF ? You don’t need to add 35 tickers in your profile per month. 

And they publish n number of articles both postive and negative on almost all top s and p and Nasdaq tickers. So that they can always claim “told you so”. Their tech analysis is non-analysis analysis. Their analysis was fucking dumb.

I see a group of people who say “well MF did suggest you good tickers you did not enter at right price. “ well fuck me in my butt that logic can be applied to any and every stock. They aggressively market and suggest to buy stocks rn. 

Ps: don’t fall for MF.

2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Defense Metals [DEFN] - Economic Analysis of huge REE mine due soon Defense Metals \[DEFN\] is an exploration and mining company that has 100% rights to a 1,708 hectare site named Wicheeda located in British Columbia, Canada. It is advancing the Wicheeda Rare Earth Elements (REE) deposit through resource expansion drilling, metallurgical optimization, and initiation of environmental baseline studies. A Preliminary Economic Analysis of the site is due to be released next month.

**Highlights**

* The Wicheeda site is huge and is highly accessible. It will be one of the biggest Rare Earth Metal mines in North America.
* THE COMPANY IS CALLED DEFENSE METALS AND HAS PICTURES OF FIGHTERS AND TANKS ON THEIR WEBSITE
* Initial testing from the site has discovered high-grade deposits of rare earth metals.
* The company is undervalued compared to the sites potential. Estimates predict there could be up to $6 Billion worth of Rare Earth Metals there.
* A full Preliminary Economic Analysis (PEA) is currently being completed and due to report in May.      Rare Earth Metals (REM) are a strategic interest to Western Governments.
* Rare Earth Metals are vital for defense production, batteries, electric motors and others. The US Government is looking to support and invest in REE miners.
* A strong Board of Directors with alot of experience rapidly developing companies. Several have experience in miners.
* PRIME candidate to be bought out by a Chinese or US company

The West currently relies on China for 80% of Rare Earth Metals. The demand for these metals will increase substantially over the next few years. Western governments, especially the US, will look to develop a domestic supply. DEFN are a prime candidate for support from the US Government.

The stock is currently valued at $30million. The PEA is due to come out in May. Assesing the initial drill results show the site could have up to $6 billion in rare earth metals. DEFN has plans to develop a fully integrated site at Wicheeda and look at developing other sites."
2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"I'm disillusioned with the market as a whole. Any recommendation for foolproof, low risk, boomer stock for a big investment? 
Backstory - Got into investing at the start of the year. Rode the gamestop train and was immensly annoyed at the manipulation taking place on it. Got out for a £5k profit.

Got back on the gamestop train and am sitting at a £200 loss.

Got onto the meme train of a certain stock running this week that deals with Lidar tech. Had 5k profit, was too greedy, got tied up and couldnt check my profile, ended up with a 2k loss.

I really struggle with taking profits. It's probably greed. This is the biggest part of my investing life that I need to work on. I always think ""hmmm 20% profit, thats good, but 25% is better"". This mindset screws me every time, to the point I end up taking a loss, or taking a tiny profit because I held on and lost the big profit.

On the back of this week, I threw a yolo at Amazon 2 hours before earnings and made about £600 with an £18,000 play. Sold the next day.

Now, this next thing is what really pissed me off - When I first started investing, I wanted to do my own DD.

I found a British company called Scirocco Energy. It was a pennystock, trading around the $1 mark, but they had a couple of things I liked. Some mining operations set up for a few years down the line, and it looked pretty slick with some reasonable figures. It was my very first investment, and I put about £30 in, just so I could say I was ""in the market"".

It traded sideways FOREVER. Until all of a sudden, the other day, it went skyward, 60% in a single day, On no news at all. it was obvious it was being pumped and dumped. I sold and took my tiny $16 profit.

It irked me though. Someone has found this stock, pumped it up to high heaven and is in the process of dumping it. There's zero regulation. Nobody gives a toss. Nobody cares.

Look at gamestop. Brokers literally turned off the market for a couple of days and caused retail a world of pain.

The mavis was another glorified pumped up memestock.

It just stinks.

So, I'm kinda done with this short term investing.

I'm looking for a long term investment, something I can throw that £18,000 back in and do a Buffet on it. Leave it for a year or two and see what happens. Something which is only gonna go up, even if it is at a very slow rate. Low risk, low reward is fine by me, because my anxiety can't take any more of the huge changes in price on meme stocks.

Suggestions anyone? Stick it all back in amazon? Microsoft? Some ETF that i'm unaware of? Maybe even BRK.B?

I hope this doesn't come across as salty ranting tears because I lost money, in reality, my £30k profile has probably broken even (maybe a tiny loss) since I started investing, but it's really opened my eyes to how it all works, and how much of a casino it all is.

I've got a couple of meme-ish long positions which hopefully might come good this year, but I need some stability in my life."

EPD is widely considered to be one of the best managed companies around, and they pay a consistent dividend to boot. CNX is a domestic natural gas producer to monitor, too. Earnings were great, and they have room to grow. 

I think TSM at 117 is an absolute steal given your profile. That is a very fair price for them, and analysts agree it’s likely an undervalued stock. 

Lockheed at 380 is still a good deal, too. They pay a dividend and have a proven track record with room to grow on top of their current valuation.

CAG (Conagra Foods) pays a divvy and could grow 10% without much of a push, and have weathered COVID gracefully. Recently upgraded by Morningstar and not without reason. One of the last undervalued food sector stocks left, IMO.

For example, get up 20% (which is very high for a short term move, so you should be cashing out here anyways) then just set your stop loss to the 15% profit target.  That way if it moves against you, you get to keep most of your gains, and if you think it will keep moving up can capture the remaining 5%.  Truth be told shooting for 5% more when you’re already 20% up is going to result in more losses than wins unless this is a long term investment that appreciates over time to those levels.  20% in a day or a week, especially if it doesn’t have a catalyst, is likely not going to hold forever.

I do ""crocodile investing"" for short term trades - using pots of money that I could lose without bankrupting.   I wait until a quality company (I watch 20 companies daily) or a stock sector has a bad day or week.  I jump in with $30-50K.   Make a 2-6% profit.  Jump out.  I usually only make $600-$4000 a shot.

In a hypothetical world where I was the only trader, (no bid / ask), I'm curious to know if there's any way to estimate or predict how much a stock's market price would move based on ""single"" trades... Or maybe you can help point me in a direction to see if this can be determined, (if at all...).

Example, (considering the float would be a significant part of the equation)

Stock A is currently at $100, if an order for 1000 shares is filled at $100, does this do anything to the share price?

How does this change if the order was for 10,000 shares? Or 100,000 shares?

Kinda like I'm looking to figure out a delta, but instead of underlying / derivative relationship, it relates to volume / share price.

Or, does volume do nothing to the sp in the absence of the bid/ask?  Is there any math there, or is it all human emotion based on supply and demand?

Thanks for any thoughts.

**EDIT: thanks for the responses... I'd like to revise this a touch;**

If I had an imaginary currency, (that didn't allow for any arbitrage variable), and bought 100 USD, that USD would still be worth a buck a pop.

Is there any way to graph or chart the human sentiment surrounding the idea that someone might pay me more than 1 USD, (using that same imaginary currency), based on supply alone?

Working with extremes, if I only had 100 USD, I'd hypothesize that nobody would give me any more than a dollar each.

But what if I had 2 trillion?  I'd start to think that someone might be willing to offer me more than $1 each if I had 99% of the supply... (even if I wasn't taking part in the demand side by ""asking"" for $1.25 each.)  

Probably more of a psychology of economics question at this point, but I'm now curious if anyone knows if this type of behaviour has been studied, or where I'd start looking?"

If your willing to buy it for 100 and the seller is willing to sell it at 100 there would be no need for a change. Change can only happen if the seller is willing to drop their price or the buyer is willing to pay more. If both parties are happy with the market value no change will occur.

2021-05-01 10:33:46,stocks,"I feel like you’re missing something fundamental here. 

> Stock A is currently at $100

This means that the last time a trade was filled, it was for $100. Usually a stock price is a last price, or the most recent amount of money per share that happened on the exchanges. 

> if an order for 1000 shares is filled at $100, does this do anything to the share price?

No, it was filled for $100 meaning the most recent amount of money per share that happened on the exchanges was $100 per share. Unless you’re talking average fill. 

When you submit a buy order, your brokerage (whatever system they use) will try to find all sellers that match your needs. Sell order finds buyers. 

In your solo participant market, if you tried to buy something there would be no sellers... since you’re the only participant. So you wouldn’t get your order filled, sell or buy. 

This is true of any market, whether for stocks, pencils, or CS GO skins.

Edit:

There is math, usually the perceived value of the company (which is hard to determine for certain companies), as well as potential growth. Otherwise it’s just people want to buy at a price and others want to sell at a price and emotions are just shortcuts to mathing."

Tesla crashed from 880 to 500 for a split second because a goofball sold his shares at 500. It instantly shot back up again. That's why you always limit sell your order, even at market hours. 

Heck, if you find a heavily traded stock and you spend your time on pre-market and after hours you can get them sometimes 50% or more off, just because a poor sucker forgot to put in a limit price and just sells or buys at whatever price, not realizing if my price of 2000$ a share for a 10$ stock is the only price, then he will buy at that price.

Considering he doesn’t want to put any money in the market through his entire career, he probably won’t sleep well at night knowing his “respectable amount” of money, which I assume is his life’s savings, will be in the market even via ETFs. 

If he trusts the banks, going into a mutual fund isn’t always a bad thing. Sure the fees are higher than your average ETF, but if it makes your father sleep well at night knowing that his money is managed by the bank, it is worth it. There are plenty of people that suit the mutual fund type and it’s fine. 

Also consider switching to other HISA banks. There are often promotions you can take advantage of by switching and opening HISAs (at least in Canada) that can grant you 1-2% interest over a 6 month period. It can be a hassle switching banks often, but it can also be worth it to squeeze some extra % more. 

I don’t think you should convince your father to invest his money. Yes, it isn’t the best financial thing to do to have everything in a HISA, but you also don’t want to lose your father’s hard earned money. He might not be able to even tolerate ETF volatility and end up bailing on a market downturn.  It might be better to seek out a financial advisor to help him."

but AVWV, a global low-volatility ETF from iShares, has a beta of .60 -- the ups & downs are 40% lower than VOO/VTI.  EDIT -- forgot the link: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ACWV

another plus is that low-vol funds also lean towards value stocks from big established stable companies, and are more likely to pay dividends. ACWV dividend yield is 1.3%, better than a savings account or CD these days. relatively generous dividends can psychological offset the ups & downs. the top holdings of ACWV include Verizon, Roche, McDonalds, Merck, Waste Management ... these are not trendy, unstable new companies. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ACWV/holdings?p=ACWV"

Keeping everything in cash in a 0.5% interest account when the inflation rate in USA is averaging 2.4% this year, it just means he's losing money. But it's a very boomer mentality (i.e.: I would rather have small or no gains than lose money) so good luck with that conversation, it will be challenging.

Go look for some of those low beta high yield boring stocks and ETFs. FTS is my favourite in that category. But I think if you're describing someone who is this risk intolerant, you'll need to start with some education on market basics before you go and dump some of his cash into VOO or VTI."

LEXCX, kind of an oddball fund but worth mentioning. the oldest passively managed fund in America. started with 30 industrial blue chip stocks held in equal numbers. is restricted from buying new shares in other companies, apart from spin-offs/mergers. now has about 20 stocks, mostly old-school boring and profitable. Union Pacific rail is their largest position, with Berkshire Hathaway the second (Berkshire bought out a company held in LEXCX), and other names like Linde, Marathon Petroleum, Chevron, Proctor & Gamble, etc. the fee is reasonable, very low turnover, and the long-term record is good (not spectacular over the last decade, but not horrible either). might be an option for someone who can't quite wrap their head around the internet, but does understand railroads or the oil industry.

And it has some interesting examples:  


>Manipulation Methods  
>  
>Manipulation takes many forms in the markets. One way people can [deflate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp) the price of a security is by placing hundreds of small orders at a significantly lower price than the one at which it has been trading. Investors get the impression that there is something wrong with the company, so they sell, pushing the prices even lower.  
>  
>Another example of manipulation is placing simultaneous buy and sell orders through different [brokers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp) that cancel each other out. This form of manipulation gives the perception, due to the higher volume, that there is increased interest in the security.  
>  
>These false order techniques are often combined with the spreading of false information through online channels and message boards that other investors may frequent. The outside barrage of bad information combines with seemingly legitimate market signals to encourage traders to pile on or off a trade.  
>  
>The [pump and dump](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pumpanddump.asp) is the most frequently used manipulation to inflate a microcap stock artificially and then sell out, leaving later followers to hold the bag. The opposite of the pump and dump is the less common [poop and scoop](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poopandscoop.asp). The poop and scoop method is used less because it is harder to make a legitimately good company look bad than it is to make an unknown company look amazing.

2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Do rebalancing ETFs generally realize capital gains for shareholders? For example, consider the ETF, RSP: ""The Index equally weights the stocks in the S&P 500® Index. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced quarterly.""

If I were to try to replicate the ETF on my own, every quarter I would buy/sell stocks to rebalance my portfolio and therefore realize capital gains.

Intuitively investing right into the ETF should be no different + holding fees. Am I wrong?

(Canada or USA)"
2021-05-01 01:43:52,stocks,"Could be, and some do have tax consequences. the etf charter will specify how it works. But, since they could be different Only way to be sure is read the prospectus....unfortunately."
2021-05-01 04:25:24,stocks,"Well, in some european countries you have to pay taxes for accumulating ETFs. But this is more because of paid dividends which will be re-invested automatically and not because of rebalancing."
2021-05-01 05:01:31,stocks,"Don’t know what you’re jurisdiction is, but where I’m from (Ireland) which has a lot of investment vehicles domiciled here, the ETF itself doesn’t incur capital gains tax on selling, and doesn’t pay income tax on income earned (May incur some withholding tax however). The bill gets passed to the investor when they either receive distributions from the ETF (N/A if it’s an accumulating) or sell shares of ETF at a profit. Net effect is if I’m correct, you could theoretically match the allocation of say the S&P and make the same % gains, but you’re real returns wouldn’t match an ETF tracking because of the distinction above. This is for where I’m from but I’d imagine where you’re located it will be about applying to the local tax laws in the same context. Fees will have somewhat of an impact too but hard to estimate."
2021-05-01 12:44:12,stocks,Yep says in the prospectus that capital gain is taxed and increases with turnover rate. Thank you.
2021-05-01 12:43:37,stocks,Yep I think it is different here in Canada.
2021-05-01 13:30:02,stocks,"Not a prob 👍, so I guess that means if people are turning over the fund a bunch, even if you are holding, you still get stuck with footing your ownership portion of the tax bill (at least that’s what I would think). So ‘turnover rate’ metric would be an important one on that fund."
2021-05-01 16:26:18,stocks,Yeah. Gives me incentive to emigrate to a country with no capital gains tax.
2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"For anybody successful in day trading, how long did it take for you to learn, and consistently start to earn money? Seems I might want to get into stocks since if I did get good at it, this is something I can do with no boss, and I can just make money as needed, with no specific schedule, and at home. How long did It take you guys to learn it and get good at it. And how long do you think it would take me to learn if and start profiting?"
2021-05-01 00:43:40,stocks,About 15k cash in losses
2021-05-01 01:29:55,stocks,"Newsflash - no day trader consistently makes money - not by ""learning"" as you ask in your question.  None.  Now people can get lucky and some can get really lucky for a long period of time.  That's just statistically expected.  Some get lucky and some don't (look up normal curve in statistics and variance).  But to think anyone here can consistently beat the market consistently by day trading is ludicrous.  There are literally hundreds or more likely thousand of phds and then thousands more MBAs working at mega investment firms across the world with access to immense amount of data that you and I could never get, have super computers that identify the slightest discrepancies or changes in volume, sentiment, spreads, etc and look for arbitrage opportunities and use AI and complex algorithms and BTW also have connections in the industry and politicians that can tip them off for any possible winds of change and you think some Joe Schmo sitting at home in his underwear looking at his $1,000 lap top screen by looking at charts using his ""technical analysis"" is going to beat them?  GTFO.

Now this is different than medium to long term investing.  People can consistently make money doing that.  

But as it relates to day trading?  The WSB guys have it right.  It's a casino."
2021-05-01 00:49:24,stocks,Day trading is incredibly risky. There's much easier and more consistent ways to make money in the market. Come on over to r/thetagang

2021-05-01 00:56:38,stocks,"Good question, it really depends on a few factors but I would say from 2 months to 2 years.
Factors affecting the time:
1) Time you commit to learning and trading
2) Time it takes a person to fully understand a concept (this varies alot between people)
3) Ability to find the right resources to learn from."

Do you already have like $500,000? Because at a 10% annual return that's what you would need to earn $50k/year and that assumes you start right away making profit and don't lose any in the learning process.

Hell even if you somehow managed to get an unreal 50% average annual return you would still need $100,000 in capital to make $50k/year"

I work at a platform that drives trade ideas from data analysis and we recently launched our mobile applications. Since I am spending a lot of time with mobile apps now, I just wanted to see what apps do others use here for their day to day trading.

This might help create a good list of all the good apps out there, which will help everyone here.

Let's go. I'll start first.

2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Future covid treatment pending EUA EUA expected in 1-4 weeks. Shorts are trying to silence this company. Please do your own DD. I’ve been following this company for 6 months and I am in it for the long haul. 

this drug is immune to mutations of COVID-19, simply because it does not target COVID-19. This “in the weeds” company is called Humanigen and their therapeutic drug is called Lenzilumab.
 
Lenzilumab, with other treatments including steroids and/or remdesivir, help prevent and treat an immune hyper-response, (cytokine storm). GM-CSF is responsible for activating macrophages and monocytes that contribute to disease severity, Mapping Severe COVID-19 in the Lungs at Single-Cell Resolution – NIH Director's Blog .[mapping severe covid](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2021/04/13/mapping-severe-covid-19-in-the-lungs-at-single-cell-resolution/)
 
Fully administered in one day, Lenzilumab improves patient SpO2 levels within the first 24 hours as shown by mayo clinic study and can prevent progression to invasive mandatory ventilation by 54%. It helps get patients out of the ICU/ hospital sooner, making more room for other critical patients in need. Humanigen Inc. - Humanigen Reports Positive Phase 3 Topline Results Demonstrating That Lenzilumab™ Improves Survival Without Need for Mechanical Ventilation in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19[phase 3 results](https://ir.humanigen.com/news/news-details/2021/Humanigen-Reports-Positive-Phase-3Topline-Results-Demonstrating-That-Lenzilumab-Improves-Survival-Without-Need-for-Mechanical-Ventilation-in-Hospitalized-Patients-With-COVID-19/default.aspx)
 
One item that may be a concern is the cost of the drug. However, the need for mechanical ventilation significantly increases the costs of COVID-19 care, as well as having a prolonged stay in the ICU. I’m not sure on Canada’s numbers in our healthcare, but in the States, it’s 5x the cost Mechanical Ventilation Adds 5X the Cost to COVID-19 Care | Premier (premierinc.com)[5x cost ](https://www.premierinc.com/newsroom/blog/mechanical-ventilation-adds-5x-the-cost-to-covid-19-care)
 
The FDA has revoked EUA for Monoclonal Antibody Bamlanivimab because of its ineffectiveness against newer strains while being used for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms , FDA Revokes Emergency Use Authorization for Monoclonal Antibody Bamlanivimab (govdelivery.com)[bam is bad](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USFDA/bulletins/2cd68e3)

Of the currently available vaccines with mutations on the rise and reduced efficacy against them, I believe that Lenzilumab can help save lives and solve multiple problems that we are currently facing. Such as, reduce need for invasive mandatory ventilation, immune to mutant strains, reduce hospital stay ie. More bed availability, fast reoxygenation response, fully administered in 1 day, cost savings on healthcare, etc. I want to put eyes on this because it seems that it’s getting silenced from HF shorts. So much amazing news. 

Again please do your own DD but I think this is a diamond in the rough."

2021-05-01 03:26:27,stocks,"It's definitely important to do research as you mentioned and not apply heuristics, which could lead to incorrect assumptions. 

The widely-referred to data is not applicable to covid vaccines/treatments as covid itself is only a year old and yet you see vaccines/treatments already granted EUA.

Instead they need to go after the high frequency traders who are screwing the individual investor who does not have the opportunity to trade in and out of a stock multiple times a day or week.  The HFT trader is the guy who is also the short that is causing your stock to be ground into the dirt.  

I would not be objectionable to a One cent tax per share on all transactions.  As Elizabeth Warren kept saying. How about you millionaires and billionaires just giving us an extra .01 cent more in taxes.  
You can bet that the Democrat investor/backers would not be in favor of this because of what it would cost them.

2021-04-30 23:25:36,stocks,"The problem is people like this are too ignorant to realize HFT has reduced the spreads.  All they see is someone makes more money than they do, and even though those people are already paying nearly all the taxes, they should pay even more."
2021-05-01 01:25:22,stocks,"HFT is High Frequency Trading. Meaning hundreds of thousands - millions of trades per day, holding a position for a few seconds only HFT isn't 20 - 50 buys or sells in stocks or futures / options. SO...  going out on a limb, you won't be affected."
2021-04-30 22:43:33,stocks,"Dude. This tax would only apply to people with very high incomes. Very likely not you. If it does apply to you, then you’re doing just fine either way."

2021-04-30 23:58:09,stocks,"Some HFTs are also market makers. The MMs are there to allow you to negotiate at the best possible price and quickly by offering a bid/ask.
The longer the stock is held, the higher is the risk of inventory. It's not the job of a MM to be intentionally directional.
Otherwise, they are paid (by stock exchange) to provide liquidity during the session so the longer they provide liquidity higher the probability to be paid will be."

2021-04-30 23:18:25,stocks,"No it wont & no he won't. The Dems are for the working people, they won't raise rates on the average American. That narrative is a Wall St / Republican talking point meant to get you to vote against yourself because they don't want to pay anything, especially they don't want to help you or any other member of the 90%

 Just think about this: 

Has the life of the average American gotten better or worse in the last 30 years?  

Have tax rates on the wealthy and corporations decreased immensely in the same time frame? 

Have tax rates on the average American decreased in line with wealthy and corporate tax cuts?"

Delete the HFTs and that will be some Medium & High Latency Hedge Funds, delete them and that will be the Banks, delete them and that will be the smartest Individual Investors which will kick their ass.
Your comment about HFT seems to be not the result of a deep analysis."
2021-05-01 06:57:04,stocks,"Thanks all, I was picturing a tax on swing and day trading, or an end of year tax on more than X number of trades in a year. I make a ton of trades in a year but no way in a hell thousands or millions in a day."
2021-05-01 02:00:10,stocks,This very specific scenario you raise sounds like a technicality that could very easily be remedied through adjusting how income is filed. The primary function of a stock is to financially support a company that you believe in and be rewarded by sharing it’s success for doing so. Reading charts and trading on volume and trends  is basically just gambling and why not tax those gains more? Especially if you’re already as rich as you’d have to be to get hit with this tax.

2021-05-01 02:17:34,stocks,"HFTs don't read chart or practice gambling.
The primary function of some HFT's is to provide liquidity (""they are the market"") and allow the other participants to do what you say (gambling) and for others trading or investing.

If Individual Investor lose money it's not link to the HFTs but by the fact that they trade randomly and lose money by paying fees, spread & loss.

The only thing you can fault is the fact that they left the market in periods of volatility (Volatility Increase, Liquidity Decrease, Spread Increase, Volatility Increase => Market Quality Decrease)... Who would want to stay (inventory risk) in a market that fluctuates 1% per 10/sec.

The interesting fact is that proof than without them => Market Quality decrease a lot."
2021-05-01 16:42:12,stocks,I mean this will affect a very small portion of the population. Hardly anyone has over a million dollars they'd want to liquidate at any given moment
2021-04-30 23:36:30,stocks,"So your part of the upper 10% who doesn't want to pay their share. I understand why you have that view then, as wrong as it is."
2021-04-30 23:15:16,stocks,"Tax is cost. Increase the costs and they will reduce their activities hence the market quality. 
Then, you will deal with higher spreads and lose more money per deal.
If the costs are too high, the smaller HFTs could left the market."
2021-05-01 03:48:00,stocks,What? Are you just calling Uber rich day traders MMers? That isn’t a thing. That’s what a brokerage does. I’m not even sure that’s what your saying though cause what you wrote is so so overly complicated and confusing.
2021-05-01 00:28:05,stocks,"I pay my fair share in accordance with the current tax law. The problem with social engineering is that they will get it down to the lowest level.

The problem is definition it when they get down to it they will create more garbage to get to the average investor."
2021-05-01 08:21:04,stocks,"Broker provide execution. 
One of the basic scheme :
MM HFTs provide quote (bid/ask) to a Broker who execute the orders of their clients at this bid/ask.

2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"ISNS? How did this even happen? ISNS has an average daily volume of around 44,000 shares being traded. Today after news regarding a rise in dividends as well as a share buyback it surges in volume to almost 45 million shares with a price increase of just over 40%.
However, it only has a public float of around 4 million shares. Really doesn't add up to me, can anyone provide some insight as to how such a large number of shares were traded in one day?

2021-05-01 04:49:11,stocks,"Local energy storage, played via STEM.  There's lots of EV players and lots of companies messing around with rewewable-based electrical generation.  But for renewables to truly take over, collection and storage is necessary.  STEM is the far-and-away leader.  

Same with EV's.  Our electric grid can't even handle warm days or cold snaps without choking, and even the current infrastructure plan won't change that reality.  We've driven the wheels off it.  It's done.  

Right now, when the workday ends, people get home and demand 2,000 watts each, which stresses the grid to the brink.

Now realize that in an EV world, when people get home, they'll demand 12,000 watts, comprised of their usual 2,000 watts, plus an extra 10,000 watts for charging their cars overnight.  

People are absolutely, undeniably, going to have to make and store their own electricity if the dream of EV's in every garage is going to happen.  That's going to require everyone to have what STEM sells."

2021-04-30 22:16:04,stocks,"A lot of comments here are recommending biotech sector which is certainly poised to grow in the next decade. I personally have money in TMO (Thermo fisher Scientific) because I think they are a solid company in the long term. It would be tough to find a lab anywhere that did not overwhelmingly use TMO products. These products range from simple molecular biology reagents to extremely expensive state of the art instrumentation such as mass spectrometers that need expensive service contracts. The only thing TMO lost out on was sequencing where their ion torrent platform simply could not compete with illumina. 

The TMO play in my opinion is to cash in from the general growth of the biotech industry. For example, the recent covid test is run on the kingfisher flex platform and this alone is a $65k instrument. They provide solutions such as sequencing prep kits too which I have used previously. Literally anything you need to do in a lab related to molecular biology, TMO will have a kit or product that will help.

TLDR: TMO is like a biotech walmart. Products are not cheap, but labs will still purchase them. I personally use their products everyday (in previous jobs and present)

Edit: Thank you for the award! My first ever. Bonus points for TMO - The 65k instrument that mentioned used for covid testing can also be used for many other types of workflows. This instrument was on back order when we tried to order some a few months ago. Another great feature about the numbers is the healthy PE ratio in the current market (around 30) and also pays a dividend.

Edit 2. The products offered are of vast variety. I will list them in as logical of a fashion as I possibly can. You can buy lab supplies (test tubes, micro centrifuge tubes, etc), instrumentation such as centrifuges, refrigerators, PCR cyclers, plate readers (fluorescence, uv, etc), microscopes, flow cytometers, lab automation equipment (such as kingfisher platform) and this instrumentation list can go on. 

On a biologicals side you can buy antibodies against various proteins of interest, fluorescent markers, click chemistry reagents, pcr cycling master mixes, you can custom synthesize DNA strands, peptide sequences, buy linkers to be able to hybridize antibodies to DNA strands if required (as drug delivery systems). 

You want to insert a gene into a plasmid and then express that protein in mammalian cell culture using an adenoviral vector? Sure, they have all the required kits to be able to do that and the instrumentation that is required to go with the entire workflow. 

You want to buy an orbi trap mass spec instrument because you want to study post translational modifications on proteins? They got you covered.

Point is, this is a good company and will grow with the industry. The list of products is way too large for me to type out but they've got you covered. Literally mostly anything you want to do in a molecular biology lab"

[https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/bulk-container-packaging-market](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/bulk-container-packaging-market)

&#x200B;

There are many other sources and there is a little more to it than mentioned in this article. An effect we still see from 2008 when there was a peak of available container ships is a shortage of these ships present day. Companies went bankrupt and ships where confiscated. However banks and other parties that confiscated these ships as collateral could do little to nothing with it because of the lack of demand for these ships. This effected the companies that where in the business of producing these kind of ships and so, many where scaling production down for years. Also with the new worldwide transition to cleaner vessels came a lot of uncertainty. Europe for example has heavy impacted the industry with legislation for emissions resulting in companies to wait longer with purchasing new ships due to to future uncertainty of what European legislation (and other parts of the world as well) might bring. So we have a shortage of ships to transport all kind of goods, we have peak demand for these goods and the result is increasing charter prices. Even if they ramp up production worldwide (ship production) it will take years to actually get at a level where there is some sort of equilibrium in the market."

The mills and 2nd tier suppliers have no incentive to drop prices back down, so long as no one breaks rank to do so. I think you’re right, steel could be big."
2021-05-01 02:03:25,stocks,"Definitely steel.  Particularly the companies that are investing in ""Green Steel"" - using electric arc furnaces instead of blast furnaces (plus some other tech) to greatly reduce emissions.   Steel production currently produces \~5% of the world's CO2 emissions, so companies that are willing to invest in the newer tech will benefit not only from the big infrastructure and housing demands, but also will be in a great position when governments start trying to reduce CO2.   I predict there will be a tipping point over the next few years where the old blast furnaces will be forced to shut down or face penalties, giving companies who invested in EAFs a big advantage."

2021-05-01 09:58:18,stocks,"There’s a few reasons, none of which I find particularly valid:

-1) The discontinuation of VX-814 shocked the institutional investors (who own the vast vast majority of shares) and there was an overreaction

-2) Building on the above - because VX-864 shares the same MoA (although structurally distinct), there is very little probability of success assigned to it. Therefore, negative news there should bring a small downward movement. However, positive news should bring a strong upward movement. The catalyst will occur within the next ~2 months

-3) Vertex, in my opinion, is a home run hitter. Their pipeline is either in very new modalities, targeting new MoAs, or therapeutic areas with high unmet need. As such, the pipeline is seen as extremely risky. Some concern here is valid as the PoS is lower for innovation, but I think the concern is far too much. The recent amendment to CTX001 signal’s Vertex’s confidence there, even though the street doesn’t give much credit PoS or revenue wise to Vertex"

But what looks good for paysafe is only the revenue. They bring in ~$1.5b a year. And of that, it has about $500mm ebitda guidance. Which isnt terrible. But for a company that just diluted massively to go public, it's not cheap by any means. 

Also have to look at earnings and their guidance when it comes. That will be a better indicator of future earnings and growth projections. And always remember the market cycle we are in, speculation and inflation doesn't mix well. SPACs have taken a hit, and this one is still up. So caution with it. 

But all in all, it's probably not the worst gamble I've seen, and like I said, when you compare it to paypal, it's really not that bad, cheaper than that, but it also came public through a SPAC and it will have to earn it's multiple."

2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"My all-weather portfolio for this crazy market. I posted this in the thread but got no response.  :(  Maybe if I post it here and elaborate it might be worthy of feedback and discussion.  Here it goes.

So firstly, this wasn't exactly my main inspiration, but retroactively I did realize that my portfolio was, in a way, similar to [Ray Dalio's All-Weather portfolio and also the Golden Butterfly portfolio](https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/all-weather-golden-butterfly/).  The asset allocations are not really the same but I do feel there's some resemblance in the approach.

The All-Weather portfolio provides less return than VTI/VTSAX (total stock market index), but it also promises to perform in all scenarios.  Ray Dalio said it also protects you from any black swan events... theoretically you should never be able to lose.  The Golden Butterfly is the same idea. Take a look at these awesome stats from the link above:

**Vanguard’s Total Stock Market Fund**

* Average Annual Return +9.4%
* Deepest Drawdown (2008) **-49.3%**

**Golden Butterfly**

* Average Annual Return +7.94%
* Deepest Drawdown (2008) **-10.8%**

The Golden Butterfly has an average annual return that's about 1.5% lower compared to VTI/VTSAX, but with a proven track record of much less volatility: 5 times less during the 2008 crash, in fact.

Anyway, I can already tell I'm probably going to get flamed because ""my portfolio has nothing to do with the Golden Butterfly or Ray Dalio's idea"" (note: he did say that the percentages were not exact).  But whatever, hope I was able to share something cool with y'all and just note that my investment thesis isn't to completely replicate either of these two ideas, but rather create a portfolio that may perform in a similar way.  So, here goes:

**My all-weather portfolio for this crazy market**

*Like Ray Dalio, my percentages are not entirely exact, either.*

Roth IRA: **45% Target Retirement Fund** (90% stocks, 10% bonds, automatically rebalances as I approach retirement)

Taxable Account: (I use a taxable account as well because I may need to pull out some gains in the mid-term pre-retirement)

**VTI:** 15% (Total Stock Market)

**VXUS:** 7.5% (Total International Stock Market)

**MSFT**: 8%

**AAPL:** 6%

**Dividend Stocks:** 15% (I like tobacco: I hold BTI, PM, IMBBY)

**Various commodities and alt. assets:** 5% (mining stocks, bullion, I bought a small position in an ETF that tracks an asset which shall not be named here)

\---

If you run the math you could say this comes to about **75% growth** (index funds, MSFT, AAPL) and **25% defensive** (dividend stocks, commodities, bonds, etc.).

My only bond exposure is in my target retirement fund, and that's because they buy them for me.  Ray Dalio himself says bonds are trash right now, and I agree.  They are expensive and real yields are negative.  Thus, my dividend paying stocks act as a bond proxy.

I chose tobacco stocks because I think it's good business no matter what's going on.  All 3 of my companies are international players who have exposure to slower declines or even increases in smoking rates via global markets.  IMBBY is an absolute killer bang for your buck, but of all 3 of my companies it's the one that could be in danger of failing.  BTI and PM look like they could continue to see growth in their new product categories (heat-not-burn, vaping, cannabis).  Anyway, these could be sold and switched as needed, but in the medium-term they are holds.

My commodities, etc. act as an inflation hedge.  Also a crisis hedge for whatever may come.

VTI and VXUS act as the primary drivers of growth.

MSFT and AAPL I chose to hold on to because I already owned them, and didn't think it would be worth selling them just to buy more index funds.  The idea is that they will A. outperform index funds, B. do about the same as index funds, C. do slightly worse than index funds, but only slightly.  They may also survive a drawdown better than the entire market.  What's unlikely is that they severely underperform at any point.

One reason for this new portfolio is because I tried my hand at individual stock picking and confirmed the age-old wisdom that most stock pickers don't beat the market.  The market was killing me, so I decided to sell most of my individual picks. I ""sinned"" a bit by holding on to my sin stocks, but I think I make a good case for them as bond proxies.  I also don't think MSFT and AAPL are really big brain picks.  I'll be OK there.

The overall idea, however, is to stick with the index funds.

The other idea is that I don't like uncertainty and I feel more comfortable with this allocation than with 100% equities.

One final note: I'm keeping my second-tier emergency fund in series I bonds.  They have a fixed yield for their lifetime, and also an adjustable yield that changes with inflation every 6 months.  The current fixed yield is 0%, but I own them anyway because it's still better than a money market fund.  Tomorrow new yields are released, it's highly likely that they will be 0% again, but it may be worth taking a look at.

APPL and MSFT may outperform, will likely match, may underperform but slightly.  I find it unlikely that they will tank, and near impossible that they will tank (independently from the market) before I'm able to get out in time.

Tobacco stocks are simply for the dividend.  In terms of appreciation they will likely underperform or could even result in losses, which is something I need to be vigilant about.  The dividend, however, outperforms pretty much any other fixed income at the moment.  These companies are sound and not going anywhere anytime soon, except perhaps Imperial Brands, which I will need to keep an eye on.

>The going wisdom right now is to be overweight on international as a defensive stance. Intl stocks have far better ratios on P/E, forward P/E and P/B. VXUS is great. A small dash of frontier could be good as well.

Do you have a source for that?  I mean, I understand the part about P/E ratios, etc. But I also understand that the Fed is pumping up asset prices, and IMO, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  In a way riding the wave *is* a defensive play.  I would absolutely not go 100% on it though, that's loco.

>If I were running a high concentration of individual stocks in a defensive portfolio, I can't imagine stocks like AAPL and MSFT being the top picks (of megacap growth, they have some of the worst P/E and P/Bs, even though they are very fairly priced IMO.

I bought MSFT and AAPL because I understand the companies and their products.   GOOG and FB are kind of mysteries to me, and frankly, GOOG is out of my price range and my brokerage doesn't offer fractional shares.

I wouldn't say capital preservation is my primary goal.  But it's one goal.  I think between total risk-on and total defensiveness there is a middle ground.  I tried to capture something of the best of both worlds here, although I imagine I'm leaning more towards risk-on with this allocation.  Still, less risk-on than 100% equities.

Honestly, I see a lot of uncertainty in the future.  Coming out of Covid, global warming, geopolitics.  I'm not hoarding guns or ammo, but I think we're facing challenges that investors from 1950 - 2000 just didn't face.  I like Ray Dalio's idea of ""you never know what's gonna happen, so be prepared"".  I'm scared of 100% equities, but hey, I like making money."

2021-04-30 20:42:00,stocks,"Hey, thanks for the question. A menthol ban would be a decent blow to BTI (British American Tobacco), because they own the Newport brand in the USA, and about 50% of their market is there.  IMBBY (Imperial Brands) would take a small hit, but small, because only about 20% of their market is US-based.  PM (Philip Morris International) loses nothing because they don't sell in the US.

Still, this should be minor in the long run for both BTI and IMBBY.  You're right that smoking is gradually becoming more socially outcast, but in Europe it's still kind of trendy, and in the developing world smoking rates are either remaining steady or even increasing.  Profits should remain steady or even increase.  You also have to factor in these companies switching to next-generation products like heat-not-burn, vaping, nicotine pouches and even cannabis.

I think the panic related to the menthol news was just general panic about ""omg smoking is done forever"".  It's my understanding that people have been saying that for decades, yet here we are.  All of the tobacco stocks have since recovered since last week's nosedive.

The main stock that is affected by US regulation is MO (Altria Group aka Philip Morris USA), which is strictly US based.  I sold out of them because I don't like the prospects for tobacco in the US, and they also had a horrible Q1 with little traction on their next-generation products."

That is not the trend in the US or Europe, but in the developing world it is.  Smoking will be around for another 30 years or so at a minimum.

You're also forgetting transitions into next-generation products like heat-not-burn, vaping, nicotine pouches, and cannabis.  PM had a wonderful Q1 thanks to growth in their heat-not-burn category.

>For instance, how did the raise of the age requirement to 21 affect sales? I recently read that a country was going to ban the sale of cigarettes? Can't find anything on it atm and am kind of in a pinch, but this legislation is not unheard of.

It didn't much, since my companies are all international players.  I do not own the only company that only sells in the US (Altria Group).  I have not heard anything about a country totally banning cigarettes.  The worst I've heard is Australia who has high taxes and plain packaging.

>""good business no matter what is happening"" seems grossly negligent to me long term.

I don't think it's negligent, I've done the research.  Most investors and institutions seem to want to stay away because of moral reasons and/or the notion that there are better returns in other industries, which is true.  However, as a defensive play I don't see it as a bad move at all.  These companies are grossly undervalued when you look at their revenue streams and dividend yields, and that's even more appealing considering just how inflated everything else looks.

If there's a huge crackdown in the next 10 years then it might be worth reevaluating, but people have been saying ""this is the end"" for decades and tobacco companies are still some of the biggest and most profitable around.  Your concerns are valid but I do not see belief in these investments as negligent in any way except from a moral standpoint (if you're into that).

That federal agencies around the world continue to restrict the market? Depending on the developing world for future revenue is also risky.

2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"PLTR CEO Alex Karp recent selling breakdown  First of all, this is not FUD. I'm just trying to break down the given numbers on Karp's recent stock sales.   
Alex Karp has sold over 54 million shares so far according to [http://openinsider.com/insider/Karp-Alexander-C./1823951](http://openinsider.com/insider/Karp-Alexander-C./1823951)According to [https://fintel.io/i/karp-alexander-c](https://fintel.io/i/karp-alexander-c) his last file date states he has around 85 million shares. After his recent selloff, Alex Karp still holds around 65.9 million shares. So that means he has sold around 45% of his total PLTR shares up to this date. Now, these numbers may not be exact but 54 million shares at $20 per share roughly make up that $ 1.1 billion dollars. Can someone verify this seems like an excessive amount?

According to Karp (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/palantir-ceo-karp-earned-1point1-billion-in-2020-tied-to-equity-awards.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/palantir-ceo-karp-earned-1point1-billion-in-2020-tied-to-equity-awards.html) ), this sale is to offset taxes from his share options.

After some more calculations, Karp now holds roughly around 4.25%ish stake in PLTR. Given that (66mil shares/86mil shares \* 0.055 stakes (source number from [https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr](https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr) ownership) It seems like Karp gave up around 3.45% of his stake in PLTR to offset taxes.

However, according to the SEC filing, Karp holds an initial 68.8 million options contracts that are due to expire on December 3rd. He still holds a majority of them although undisclosed at this point. Will be interesting to see what he does with them.

They are all solid staples to any portfolio. Though I feel the luster is wearing off. These companies all speak to an era that disrupted society. Watching (and living) through the huge change these companies brought to society was a really neat experience. They collectively changed how we function in every way today.

Facebook: Like MySpace but better! Introduced society to a social media experiment that has changed our lives and the way we connect in every way. Now there are many platforms (with less users) doing the same thing. 

Apple: Media players were all called Ipods. Smartphones were all called Iphones. Tablets were all called Ipads. They completely changed how we connect with one another and with our various forms of entertainment. They ushered in a whole new generation of technology. Their loyal fanbase is what matters and I appreciate the company for the products they produce but it seems like everyone is doing what they do nowadays (they just do it a bit better). An upgrade from 1 camera lens to 3 doesn't excite me. 

Amazon: Prime Delivery. Getting stuff to your door in 2 days. GROUND BREAKING. I got hooked and never went back. Ordering from anywhere else was unacceptable. They fed our desire for ""immediate satisfaction"" and set a standard for everyone else to meet. Their entry into smart devices was a valiant effort and their web services have taken the world by storm (whether anyone really knows it or not). Now every retailer is expected to offer free shipping at the same precedent that Amazon set years ago. Maybe they will be able to accomplish drone delivery services but there are many unforeseen complications to that. This would definitely considered ""disrupting"" society once again. 

Netflix: Mail to home service turned video streaming service. Streaming movies at your fingertips was game changing. Today there are dozens of quality companies video streaming. Exclusive content from Netflix is great. They started down that path early enough knowing that others would follow them into the streaming space but how are they changing life today?

Google: ""Google It."" When this became the generic term for looking up content you knew they won the battle. Built on a search engine that boasted NO ADS to steal away from ""ask Jeeves"" and ""yahoo"" among others they changed the simplicity of search as we know it today. 

Thinking about these companies over the last 5 years are really quite boring. They make tons of money. They still don't excite me to own them. They have gotten so huge it is actually a bit scary in some ways. I feel they will migrate out of growth and into dividend portfolios over the next 5-10 years but I could be completely wrong. 

TL;DR What companies do you believe will make up the ""BIG 5"" of the future that will disrupt the way society operates today? Or do you think that F.A.A.N.G. will succeed in disrupting our everyday lives once again?"

Amazon: literally diversifying in everything and reinvests almost all of its money . Probably the best single buy and hold. 

Apple: literally the best hardware company with a cult following 

Fb: fk em but they have a monopoly on social media for now and a lot of cash 

Google: youtube , google, ad king , strong engineering

Relative to the rest of the industry, faang is boring."
2021-05-01 07:34:08,stocks,How many times did you go on FB today? Did you type this from your Apple phone? Looks like you did a lot of typing. You chillin and watchin Netflix to relax now? Did you search for me info...on Google? Oh then there's that Amazon company. FAANGs will never be boring.
2021-05-01 10:48:55,stocks,"I think it’s up to yourself to decide if FAANG is boring. I personally prefer high growth-high risk due to my age. But I don’t understand why people buy AAPL, AMZN, FB etc because they weigh so much in the s&p 500 so it makes more sense to just buy an index"

Sometimes the whole market goes sideways for years.  That's good!  Buy low not high!

The first is the Project Brown Heron effort that has the Palantir Gotham platform configured to automatically ingest data from across the Department of the Air Force (DAF) that continually push personnel, equipment, planning, health, and other readiness data sources into their common data foundation.

2021-04-30 21:59:20,stocks,"I see a lot of buzz about this company and they definitely seem to be on the brink of some big things. Their income seems to be set to come mainly from government contracts. I understand that the US military is a huge industry with a ton of spending and that’s no secret but between Palantir and the govt is it maybe not in either of their best interest to be wildly profitable? 

On one hand, a company with huge profits that only come from govt spending. On the other hand, the govt spending a pile of cash to make a company stupid amounts of money? This is a bad look for both parties to everyone not involved, no? 

Are there other instances of this being the case or are there many profitable publicly traded companies who’s income mainly comes from govt contracts? 

Genuinely interested. I’m no expert but this is my personal take on the situation."

I might try and do a DD on them soon. I honestly believe they will liquidate when there 10 year (5 years up) contract ends and Microsoft or many other competitors will steal it. I mean, they sued the US government for the contract... Do you really think they'll get It again?"

PLTR IPO price is at $7.25 and at that price, the insider including Peter Thiel probably think it is the best they can getaway with. And now, it is still at 3x IPO prices.

Ford is a great example of this. They beat EPS by a wide margin (EPS of $0.89 cents a share compared to expectations of $0.21 cents a share, and beat revenue expectations) but issued a note saying that they expected to lose production of 1.1M vehicles due to the chip shortage. 

That sent the stock down a chunk."

Retail investors make money off meme stocks because it’s a crapshoot with less involvement from the big guys?

Should I invest in something and sell it to increase the capital? Should I invest and leave it and add more to it every chance I get?

He is very specific about his investments needs. Usually you'll need a professional investor with a Muslim bank to do it. OP's safest bet is to buy relative safe stocks from individual large cap companies like Apple Inc or Microsoft or tech related ETF/funds like ARKK. Be careful when purchasing the latter. Make sure to investigate all their holdings so it suit your requirements. Even than it is no guarantee the holdings in those funds/ETF won't change in the future since they will rotate in promising stocks

2021-04-30 20:02:39,stocks,Most of this is stock options and awards. This has more to do with the stock insane appreciation instead of something immoral.

And the travel expense is because palantir doesn’t send salesmen to their biggest clients they send the CEO. That’s not cheap but it leads to huge contracts.

This is hugely different than the many claims Karp got compensated 1.1 billion only for 2020...0

Why is it legal? His salary, according to you, 1.1 million. Why would that be unreasonable for a major CEO?

His stock and option package? Again what's the problem with that?"
2021-04-30 21:03:46,stocks,Looks like Palantir employees are taking this one on the chin. Ridiculous. It makes zero sense to not put 99% of that 1.1 Billion right back into the company...not into some asshole’s pocket.
2021-05-01 01:57:38,stocks,Not sure why people are sperging out over this. He worked for those stock options probably last 10 years. Now he is reaping the rewards for that
2021-04-30 20:32:05,stocks,Its actually shocking how PLTR's DPO was just a way for insiders to cash out. Peter Thiel literally sold 1% of the *entire float* of PLTR the day his shares were not locked up. Its absolute madness how PLTR is put on a pedestal as an excellent investment.

Robert Trump, brother of ex president Trump had federal contracts with his private business for 33 million dollars that is just at a quick glance and Donald Trump just handed over management of his private businesses during his presidency from 2107-2019 he made 1.96 billion dollars and then he charged the government for room and board for all the secret service while guarding him in palm beach. Our society has lost all values, morals, and decency. There is no sense for reality for those of use that are not the top 1 percent or just middle class. Biden if anyone is listening is raising taxes on the extreme wealthy which is who Trump gave the real break and taxes on corporations and capital gains on the really wealthy. Not me. If they are not paying their fair share then ok. I know when I had a simple house zero lot line 1750 foot in Florida, my home taxes alone were 3300.

2021-04-30 23:42:56,stocks,This is what happens when a company goes public and the stock runs. This is all so misleading

not really, at the time the options and stocks were awarded the then-current fair market value was $7.60 and the options had an exercise price of $11.38, Karp received 141,000,000 options and 39,000,000 via RSU award once those start vesting."

2021-04-30 20:16:47,stocks,"Eh, regardless of this stuff, the current price seems pretty reasonable for the stock. At the very least I don't see it going down a whole lot from here, and the volatility creates a lot of profit potential with selling covered calls for people who think there's not a heavy downside risk.

$PLTR gives $797.9 million in stock options and $296.4 million in stock awards plus $1.1M cash and + travel expenses....

2021-04-30 20:34:40,stocks,It was founded in 2003
2021-05-01 02:23:42,stocks,That’s just plain wrong.  Do a little research.

2021-04-30 21:24:51,stocks,"Yeah, but selling doesn’t mean he doesn’t see future growth in the company. He could believe that the stock is incredibly overvalued and tried to save his value before a correction. He still owns a ton of shares."
2021-04-30 20:47:02,stocks,"Why? He made a ton of money. He doesn't owe anybody anything. He exercised his options and sold. It sucks for shareholders but the stock price skyrocketed, allowing him to profit massively."

2021-05-01 06:29:17,stocks,I don't understand how this stuff can get upvoted. A lot of casual investors seem to be around since the GME fiasco. People should understand that buying into the hype means you are already too late. Just a lot of salty people against PLTR because they are in the red. All because they bought at the ATH. Seeing people proud of a 15% gain in 2-3 days is just weird. I have been in since November and sitting on a 50% gain atm.

That plus security. The dude is essentially running the publicly traded version of the NSA. He's going to have ex Navy seals, secret service and people like that holding guns for him and watching his back. The kind of dudes who get paid hundreds per hour to watch him take a jog. A few helicopter rentals in a big Bell or Agusta and 800k is peanuts to people like this. Not to mention the way you wrote it makes it look like he gets 3.2 million a year for travel which makes a lot more sense.

He doesn't run in the same circles you and I do. This is high level shit peons like us don't deal in.

As an investor I'd be more concerned if a CEO is not making bank and his travel stipend gets cut. That would be a red flag.

If you want to make money you have to understand how B2B works."

2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 30, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 30, 2021**

The market fell on Friday after a record-setting session, with the S&P 500 (SPY) pulling back after recording fresh intraday highs. Market participants continue to assess the slew of corporate earnings reports and recent, encouraging economic data. 

Last night, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic that devastated the economy. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

Shares of Amazon (AMZN) outperformed the market, jumping to a new record high after reporting blowout Q1 earnings fueled by sustained demand, showing great strength even as the economy in the US begins to reopen. Shares of Twitter, on the other hand, sunk after the company fell short of estimates, disappointing investors who hoped the company would show a strong pick-up in ad sales like peers Snap (SNAP) and Facebook (FB).

Market participants also digested recent commentary from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which included no major changes to policy but did highlight recent improvements in the US economy. FOMC members said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the current pace of the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.

**Highlights**

* The Labor Department released its Weekly Unemployment Report, which shows fresh pandemic-era lows as the economy gradually reopens.
   * **Initial jobless claims, week ended April 24:** 553,000 vs. 540,000 expected and an upwardly revised 566,000 during the prior week
   * **Continuing claims, week ended April 17:** 3.660 million vs. 3.590 million expected and a downwardly revised 3.651 million during the prior week
* Shares of Uber, Lyft and Doordash (DASH) fell sharply after Reuters reported that Labor Secretary Marty Walsh supported reclassifying gig workers as employees. This change would give workers additional benefits at a large cost to companies. Recall the battle last year over Proposition 22 in California, which eventually passed in favor of companies in the gig-economy. 
* US gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 6.4% quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualized rate in the first three months of 2021, [the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday in its first estimate on GDP. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-accelerated-robust-6-123644612.html)This marked an acceleration from the 4.3% annualized growth rate from the fourth quarter of 2020
* New York City [Mayor Bill de Blasio said ](https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe/status/1387733678093127684)that NYC would open with full capacity beginning July 1. ""Our plan is to fully reopen on July 1. We are ready for stores to open, for businesses to open, offices, theaters, full strength,” de Blasio said. 
* Personal income jumped 21.1% in March over February, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday. This came in better than the 20.3% rise expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.
* Shares of Nio outperformed the broader market, trading roughly 2% higher after the company reported better-than-expected earnings.

2021-04-30 22:32:42,stocks,I have ceased looking for explanations of why a stock went up or down. Most people are just spouting off BS. There is no rhyme or reason from what I can tell.
2021-04-30 23:05:31,stocks,"Yeah I feel that man. The more I see it , the more I realize this whole thing is just BS for rich folks and I should just invest my money elsewhere."
2021-04-30 23:28:22,stocks,Stocks will go up. Just dont look for daily explanations for movement.
2021-05-01 01:59:28,stocks,Literally 4/5 FAAMG stocks went up after earnings this week right?
2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,Can anyone explain this please?! I have invested £94.02 into a company’s stocks and bought 8 shares. This was done this morning. On my portfolio view it shows I am down £11.26 but says I haven’t lost any money or gained any money. Can anyone explain why my portfolio holdings shows I’m down by around 11% within a day but the overall breakdown shows no loss today? The company I have invest in is big so I can’t imagine the value going down by 11% in 1 day?
2021-05-01 05:40:17,stocks,Many brokers use a fixed base fee and ask an additional % over the amount of shares purchased. Also check if you have to pay for dividend distribution and if you have to pay extra to be connected to an exchange. There are a lot of hidden costs with many brokers. There should be some documentation where your broker outlines all tariffs.
2021-04-30 20:14:13,stocks,Thanks very much dude. So each deal costs £11.95. Is that regardless of how much you put in?
2021-05-01 04:16:39,stocks,Yep
2021-05-01 06:52:22,stocks,Thanks for your help!
2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,Fund for child to leave and let grow I have a 1 year old and we have created a UMTF for her.  Right now all the cash gifts that she gets go into this account and I have it investing in QQQ.  Given that its going to sit for 17 years is there a better fund that I should be investing in?  A while back I saw something about a fund that is QQQ but also does some margin play that increases risk but also would increase any gains (Assuming over 17 years it goes up).  Does anyone have any recommendations or know what fund I am talking about and why it might or might not be a good idea to put the money in there?
2021-04-30 20:36:36,stocks,"Good ideas so far, if you want to get a little more detailed you can dig into some companies or ETFs of industries you believe are the future. I dont have kids but if I did I'd spread it out between stuff like 3d printing companies, the AI software and maybe a gaming company or two. Theres some esports betting sites, I wouldnt put too much into any of them but at least one to 3 of them can and probably will be successful 15 years from now. Maybe some ev companies just getting started. Maybe just a resource also, plenty of infrastructure spending means if you pick the right resource or company theres going to be growth over the next 5 to 7 years for sure. 

You get the idea, pick 5 industries you think are the future, chances are 2 or 3 of them will be, no guarantee it's any of the existing companies but the world will be a much different place 15 years from now.  Try to conceptualize the future because the successful companies 15 years from now are either just getting started or have yet to even exist.  Everybody wants to find the next apple or Amazon but that's backwards thinking, where is the future headed and choose companies that are best leveraged to take advantage of the increased market space."
2021-05-01 00:42:52,stocks,I would personally go VTI and maybe a little VXUS for some international exposure.
2021-05-01 02:58:15,stocks,"If you will really just leave it for 17 years and never touch it, even if it goes down a lot, I'd recommend TQQQ.  The problem for most people is that it is much more volatile, and people will freak out and sell.

But look at the gains vs qqq over the last 20 years: [https://www.google.com/finance/quote/QQQ:NASDAQ?comparison=NASDAQ:TQQQ&window=MAX](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/QQQ:NASDAQ?comparison=NASDAQ:TQQQ&window=MAX)"
2021-05-01 12:47:40,stocks,"FZROX. Zero fees and total market exposure. in a taxable brokerage there can be some advantages to ETFs, so VTI might be good too. 


QQQ is not terrible but it's highly volatile, and misses out on other good sectors (no small cap, no healthcare, etc). the best performing stocks of the last 20 years are not always high tech/trendy. Monster Beverage and Tractor Supply have outperformed almost everything else, including Amazon/Apple/Tesla/Nvidia, etc. if you want to keep QQQ I'd balance it out with something else that's not super-focused by sector/industry."
2021-05-01 06:49:20,stocks,"Holy moly. 
Since this is leveraged, who is liable in case it goes tits up?"
2021-05-01 07:16:06,stocks,Liable? Really?
2021-05-01 07:19:36,stocks,"I dunno, never been in a leveraged fund. No clue how they work. Obviously will look into it, but from your answer i asume i'm dumb as a stone for even thinking that when you put a miltiplyer on it'll work both ways. Nice to know. Can only lose as much as you put in, even if leveraged?"
2021-05-01 07:34:22,stocks,"Yes. You can only lose as much as you put in. There are certain mechanisms in place such that a leveraged fund cannot go to 0. However, it can still go very close to 0."

2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Green investing Hey everyone! I have been looking into investing in the green/carbon neutral industry and i have actually struggled to find some proper stocks or ETFs that are actually sustainable. The stocks that I did stumble on are nano stocks such as DGB Group NV (ticker:DGB), in which I have actually done a bit of research, it was more interesting than I expected, might post more about it later on :)
But, more generally I was wondering if anybody share this experience of struggling to find actual sustainable stocks or ETFs?"
2021-05-01 02:29:22,stocks,"How about in companies that are trying to reduce CO2 emissions in industries which pollute the most?  Steel production currently produces \~5% of the world's CO2 emissions because many mills use blast furnaces which burn coke and iron ore, which produces a ton of CO2.  

Some companies have started switching to a much more efficient and far less polluting design, called Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs).  As a bonus, these arc furnaces can be fed steel scrap, allowing efficient recycling.  I think the companies that have been investing in EAFs will really benefit as more environmental regulations are placed on the industry.  $CLF in the US and $MT in Europe are two companies that have been focusing a lot on more environmentally friendlier steel, and IMO they are both pretty undervalued."

2021-04-30 20:21:44,stocks,"I sold but not because I don't like the company.  Just decided I was a dummy and decided to go into index funds.

The only thing I would say that worried me about this company is their high level of debt.  If interest rates hike unexpectedly or anything else goes wrong, they could be in for trouble.  Likely?  No.  Possible?  Yeah, I think, but do your own research!  They also had a horrible YOY performance in their renewables sector in Q1 of this year.  I think revenue was down about 58%?  I did not find any information about why that happened although maybe that's available since the report was released a few days ago.

They're also not a purely renewable company, which was actually a good thing in my book (steady cash flow), but for a green investor maybe not the #1 pick.

Just felt like sharing since I did plenty of research on them.  I think it's a good stock but I think there are a couple of caveats to the idea of them being a very sound company."
2021-05-01 03:20:32,stocks,I've been looking at ALB and FCX but I'm just not willing to pay that much for them.  I'm watching those though.

2021-05-01 01:53:44,stocks,I’d buy next week when it dips below $180
2021-05-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Reminder to think about taking SOME profits. If you are holding your shares for the next 12+ months then disregard this post. 

This is less about micro caps (speculative plays) and more about the large cap companies. I realize how beat up EV, weed and micro caps are (though they did bounce this week).  We are at the quarter end. The big earnings week is coming to a close. Earnings were ""as expected"" even though the spin is ""exceeded expectations."" The expectation of investors was that these companies would exceed expectations which is why the beginning of the month had so many buyers.

There is going to be selling pressure over the next few days (maybe weeks). Lots of people sell after earnings simply because they don't want to hold for another three months and there are no positive catalysts in the near term to move the stock. This doesn't mean the company did anything wrong but the share price does come down. If there are enough buyers on the sidelines the prices won't move much but there will definitely be an increase of sellers out of some positions. 

Moving on to next quarter. There are a lot of supply issues and increased costs that many companies noted in their earning calls. We all know about the semi-conductor issue. Raw material costs are approaching all time highs in many sectors. Companies are raising their sale prices. The full impact of these issues won't be fully realized until the next earnings call but in preparation for that people are moving out of some of those stocks that they feel are most vulnerable. 

Also of note, as many in this forum have noted, the investments made over the ""Covid crash"" are now at their ""long term"" status and profit taking due to this will occur (is occurring) as well. ""Sell in May and go away"" is a load of crap but many people know the saying and CNBC (among others) will be using it liberally. 

These are just facts I am pointing out that are working against the market in the near term. It is your decision whether it matters or not to you. Among this will also be the ""jobs, inflation, rate hike, covid, stimulus, etc"" drama over the next few weeks (as is the usual). That can go either way and nobody knows anything for sure. There will definitely be a lot of reporting about summer travel after Covid! This will boost the re-opening plays from time to time. Also the infrastructure package will be a talking point to look forward to. 

TL;DR There will be selling pressure over the next couple of weeks which could escalate if there are not enough buyers rushing in quick enough. These buyers would hold off if ""bad news"" comes out during that time which would push share prices lower. There is definitely quite a bit of cash waiting for a buying opportunity but that usually takes an 8-10% correction to move in. It will recover over time (as always) but if you were looking to sell in the next few months there is nothing wrong with taking SOME profit at this level. If you are in it for over a year disregard this post. 

I am not telling you what to do. I am reminding you to think about what to do. You are responsible for your own decisions. Good luck out there!"

In my taxable account I have 1 particular stock I have bought and sold a number of times over the last month. As I have been getting more comfortable I have been increasing the number of shares I have executed with.  My initial purchase was at 180 and sold for 180.30, I then had a number of purchases where I averaged down but then still sold for a loss (newbie panic sell), another couple buy/sells where I made a couple dollars per share after that. I now have purchased the stock again at 176.70 but my cost basis reflects the 180.30.  The initial 180.30 was only on 10 shares, the newest purchase is on 100 shares.

When I ultimately sell will my taxable cost base be 10@180.30 and 90@176.70 or do all 100 shares get calculated at the higher amount? It's messing me up because right now it looks like a huge unrealized loss on my account, but the actual price of the stock is higher than what I just bought it for (though lower than the very first purchase)."

I have the strong believe that it is not a scam anymore. Maybe, as a point that it might be a turnaround investment, carl icahn invested last year and is going to get involved in the management:
 https://www.ariva.de/news/Bausch-Health-Announces-Agreement-With-Carl-C.-Icahn-9193786

And additionally, if you look at the news from the last two years, the news flow was constantly good and the company created better numbers than expected and the dept was massively reduced. And they have a good amount of valuable assets. 

For my risk profile (I am using a turnaround strategy) this is one of the good candidates :D

One additional thing: BHC is not cheap anymore. It was cheap one or two years ago before icahn invested. But at the current price I doubt that I would invest again.

But the moral standpoint is also valid and that's a personal decision how much you weight their past and if you can believe that they have changed or not.

But the thing is that, if you are really confident on the stock you are investing in and you know how graphs look like, then it's really a gut feeling if you want to hold or drop.  I've dropped down from 10-15% before but I never sold. Because I'm confident it will go backup throughout the day. 

Now if your talking about a stock like. AMC being you bought in at $16 but it's constantly at $9-10. This type of stock it really depends on you being your just waiting for it to go back to it's original price point but you could have made more profit by taking the loss and reinvesting it ect. 

It depends on your patience level."

Purely mathematically the portfolio is better because you can diversify away firm and industry risk. Add to that the fact that a salary is essentially a risk free return.  

That being said, if you have a passion for a business and would be unhappy or regretful not doing it, then I think starting the business is the better route.

2021-05-01 00:56:03,stocks,"I’m gonna assume you’re talking about a business worth 2 million. So in answer: it’s all about the individual and the return on investment. 

Now a business idea itself has been categorised in risk valuations for loan purposes. In short, a business that has yet to produce a profit or with higher probability of becoming bankrupt due to unusual circumstances is classified as higher risk. With many answers they compare with restaurants because they are low margin, yet reasonable customer flow. This is considered risky still yet can be serviced. A tech startup with no profit on paper has a harder time, whereas a pharmacy with roi 15% can reasonably get a 70% lvr part. 

Now, automatically considering that stocks were put to market in the first place was for corporate expansion and the original owners have been paid, capitalist approach to economic growth has generally led to the overall stock market being positive with increasing market capitalisation. The returns on capital investment is as the op stated: 10% yoy, inclusive of dividends. This requires no intervention (but not necessarily zero effort) until retirement. 

Owning a business ranges from 24/7 monitoring to also little intervention depending on ownership type (passive or silent etc) and such may earn a drawing per period. These opportunities are less frequent and usually disposed to individuals in the industry (such as old pharmacist proprietor retiring and selling his pharmacy on condition he retains 20% ownership with 17.5% withdrawal regardless of performance). His stable income is less risky than establishing a new business. 

On the other hand, a portfolio in the right hands can produce a similar result with that same less risky dividend payout also noting it has fewer opportunities. So one choice would be a closed end fund with fairly tight fixed dividend payouts regardless of fund size or price. One such would be EVT (not promoting this, not financial advice) that price ranges to half beta to market yet fixed income. In a portfolio professionally managed, this would be a good choice in given the opportunity to purchased a fund like this when the price is low still given a fixed dividend. So eg back in March 2020 the price dropped to 9 bucks so it’s return equated to 15% yoy. Now wouldn’t that be nice to have for many years?  That’s the same return on a pharmacy and without effort."

2021-05-01 04:39:49,stocks,"Personal opinion: the value in skills required to earn money are more valuable than the money itself.  I only use stocks to hold balances beyond what is enough cash for a shitty year, and the stocks are held only up to the point where I can invest in something I’m more personally involved with (regardless of the profit amount).  The stock market to me is just a tool to help accelerate access to more interesting activities, such as a restaurant, vacation rental, etc, which come with value beyond simply $$$.

Restaurants are an intensely competitive industry. You need to know that you're good at running a restaurant. The upside of any business is that you will make way more than 10% on capital if you pick the right location, have the know-how, and run it right. Remember though that restaurants go out of business all the time: it seem to me that you have to be in the top 5% of high performing restaurants to survive in the industry, whereas you only need to be average (index fund) in stocks to make money."

This valuation was from a non Silicon Valley VC firm, so lower values are more common.  $20 million to a Silicon Valley firm is basically worthless.

On top of that, no company is going to buyout a startup that only values at $20 million, because the product isn't proven at that value.

so even though i know tesla has amazing software, i think their lack of hardware is absolutely stupid, and might come back to bite their butts.
and one thing i think that might make you like autonomous driving in other brands is that while people will be more lenient if tesla messes up and gets in an accident, the legacy automakers will be absolutely trashed by tesla fanboys if even one single fender bender occurs on their autonomous systems, so the legacy automakers are going to be far more careful on their systems and test them far better. i would definitely put my family in the new gm super cruise cadillac escalade or ford mustang mach e with blue cruise."

Its also best to roll the leaps at 1 year - 6 months in my opinion, lest you try to get more gains only to have a black swan event kill the contract before it can recover. I should also mention that just owning the stock actually has more negative skew (you'd be out twice or thrice as much money for less delta to the upside to own 100 shares vs 2 contracts at .5 delta) but because stock gives you an infinite timeline to recover you aren't out the full investment if it trades down consistently but eventually recovers. Even if you had bought a LEAPS in February on most names you'd be substantially ahead of having just bought shares at the same point despite the massive covid selloff. Particularly where I buy my calls I am very vulnerable in the short term though because I typically only buy at .60 - .75 delta whereas others go for .75 - .9 which is simply excessive on a name like AAPL in my opinion. But if AAPL falls to 110 and my calls are now far OTM and I place PMCCs against that and AAPL then shoots through my sold calls, I'd be out money so that means I'm taking a bigger risk selling against my OTM calls as opposed to deep ITM ones. The PMCC revenue typically means worst case you break even over the lifetime of a long dated leaps, but I just make sure not to use so many PMCCs that I couldn't exercise the contracts if they were above water by exp, so in my portfolio right now its a bet that companies like AAPL, MSFT, DIS and etfs like IWM and SPY will be above their current levels by Jan 2023 essentially and if worse comes to worst, I'll see the contract through to intrinsic value only and exercise with the cash I haven't deployed. No strategy is fool proof, but I like the leverage it affords me while enhancing my theta returns on the short side."

2021-05-01 12:42:59,stocks,"Palantir does two things. It helps agencies collect all their data, put it in one spot, and make it all nice and neat. This is impressive considering many agencies palantir works with still use paper documents, pdf database, and their data is generally scattered everywhere. Once the data is all in one place (on their platform) they offer analytics services. It is kinda like having data scientists at your disposal.

&#x200B;

Why do I like Palantir's business model? Because you can't get rid of them once you use their service. Why? Good luck going back to scattered data after using their service for 5 years. Also, everyone eventually needs to update their data, whether that means adding new data or correcting old data. All those updates are now in Palantir's system, which means it is essentially theirs. If you cancelled your contract with Palantir, you'd lose all that data. So basically, you can't cancel unless you are able to create your own data center and analytics team, which frankly, most organizations are not able to do competently."

They're also increasing their dividend at a high rate so if you have a broker that offers DRIP,opt into that to grow it more.

If you do want to diversify, look for other giants equal to apple in other sectors. AAPL is technology, so other immovable blue chips would be KMB for consumer cyclicals, VZ in telecom, LMT in defense, CAT in industrials, O in real estate, AFL in financials, and ABBV in healthcare. There's others in each of those sectors so of course do your own research into them and make sure you like the company before buying."

2021-05-01 14:59:53,stocks,"1. The business is profitable which is how they're able to push dividends to the investors. Dividends comes from profit. If it's not profitable, how are the investors getting their money? The former owners took out every penny possible? Uhm, they sold their asset to another company. What money did they take out? You're just pushing nonsense.
2. 'Make the sport better.' Nice vague statement. MMA is more popular today than ever. Who made it better? You? You're making arbitrary statements with no evidence.
3. ""Declining the past five years.""ESPN doesn't seem to think so considering they signed a five-year deal with the UFC for $1.5 billion. Why would ESPN do that if it's a declining business?
4. 'Conor doesn't bring in PPV numbers like before.' But Poirier vs Conor 2 was the 2nd highest selling PPV event in UFC history and the 5th best selling PPV event in combat sports history.
5. The games? What games? It's called fight events and 'less' people aren't buying considering the UFC is selling near record high for PPV sales excluding years 2015/2016 (Conor's peak).
6. I don't have anything to say about the merchandise cause I don't really care but what data do you have that no one is buying it anymore? I'd like a source and not just your opinion.
7. They up the price of PPV because of inflation. Even boxing upped the price. You know the movie ticket I bought 15 years ago to watch Star Wars for $8 in NYC? It's now $16. I guess no one wants to watch Star Wars anymore so they are increasing the prices despite the fact that Star Wars The Force Awakens is the 10th highest grossing film adjusted for inflation. So who is buying the ticktes for movies when the prices increased and why is the UFC selling more PPV's (outside of 2015/2016) in the history of the UFC than ever despite higher PPV and ESPN+ costs?
8. Super-fan? Lol. You don't even make any sense. Any business model that wants to generate maximum revenue doesn't cater to super fans but to casuals. There's only a certain amount of super fans you can cater to before your market share becomes stagnant. You used to read about the UFC every day? LOL, I think that's a little too unhealthy wouldn't you say? And no super-fan calls combat sporting events a 'game'.
9. PPV's are watered down and that results in fewer PPV buys? Is that why they generated one of their total PPV sales for a calender year two years ago despite higher PPV prices? Which PPV's are watered down? Not every fight card will be a success because of injuries, scheduling, and contractual obligations UFC has to oblige by and thus, have to rush certain PPV cards. But in general, name the ten bad PPV events they had the past year that were watered down as compared to the events 6-8 years ago. Let's compare-and-contrast.

&#x200B;

The only part about your post that you got correct is that this is Endeavor trying to milk a payday for the corporate owners which is why only 10% of what you wrote was legitimate. The other 90% is purely your opinion (which is highly inaccurate) at display. You've shown zero data and unless you're going to respond with data and sources, maybe you shouldn't bother responding with another one of your 'I don't like the UFC because they mean to me' opinions again. You also don't sound knowledgeable about the subject other than you know Conor's name. Honestly, you sound like any other casual fan who knows some but definitely isn't qualified to speak about the sport."
2021-05-01 15:27:28,stocks,"I responded to his reply to me as well after I stated that 90% of what he's pushing is false. Whoever upvoted his original post clearly don't follow the UFC. This dude said he will respond tomorrow because he's having a beer but it's obvious he's likely not going to respond because he sure seems to have enough time commenting 50+ times the past two days. He legitimately has no clue what he is talking about and it's almost cringey reading someone pretend they are educated on a subject. Thus far, he pushes his opinions as facts, pretends he's a UFC fan, and comments about the UFC video games as if people care about their video games... The noticeably sad part about his argument is that he doesn't realize that boxing and MMA video games are going to be the same every year because there's only so many different ways you can punch, kick, or wrestle someone. The only reason they even continue pushing video games is because they're contractually obligated to. The 'barely breaking a profit' is hilarious to me. They're paying their investors dividends. You don't pay dividends unless your company is generating decent cash flow. The issue with the UFC isn't UFC itself. It's that the owners of Endeavor have other assets that are bleeding which is why I personally wouldn't invest. But if the UFC itself was going public, I'd potentially invest. It's funny how you bring data to it and all he does is say, ""I don't like the UFC. Low PPV numbers and bad video games. Yuck."" He wouldn't last a second having an educated discussion. Forget about the UFC paying you. How can I pay you for this beatdown you put on him?"
2021-05-01 15:08:54,stocks,"He really doesn't. And honestly, he tries to pass himself off as educated but just exposes himself every reply he makes. He has no clue what DraftKings even is or how it works. Instead, he thinks the UFC is the one pushing the betting lines... YIKES."

2021-04-30 23:21:51,stocks,"I did some of my own DD. This is posted in other threads but here..

EUA expected in 1-4 weeks. Shorts are trying to silence this company. Please do your own DD. I’ve been following this company for 6 months and I am in it for the long haul. 

this drug is immune to mutations of COVID-19, simply because it does not target COVID-19. This “in the weeds” company is called Humanigen and their therapeutic drug is called Lenzilumab.
 
Lenzilumab, with other treatments including steroids and/or remdesivir, help prevent and treat an immune hyper-response, (cytokine storm). GM-CSF is responsible for activating macrophages and monocytes that contribute to disease severity, Mapping Severe COVID-19 in the Lungs at Single-Cell Resolution – NIH Director's Blog .[mapping severe covid](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2021/04/13/mapping-severe-covid-19-in-the-lungs-at-single-cell-resolution/)
 
Fully administered in one day, Lenzilumab improves patient SpO2 levels within the first 24 hours as shown by mayo clinic study and can prevent progression to invasive mandatory ventilation by 54%. It helps get patients out of the ICU/ hospital sooner, making more room for other critical patients in need. Humanigen Inc. - Humanigen Reports Positive Phase 3 Topline Results Demonstrating That Lenzilumab™ Improves Survival Without Need for Mechanical Ventilation in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19[phase 3 results](https://ir.humanigen.com/news/news-details/2021/Humanigen-Reports-Positive-Phase-3Topline-Results-Demonstrating-That-Lenzilumab-Improves-Survival-Without-Need-for-Mechanical-Ventilation-in-Hospitalized-Patients-With-COVID-19/default.aspx)
 
One item that may be a concern is the cost of the drug. However, the need for mechanical ventilation significantly increases the costs of COVID-19 care, as well as having a prolonged stay in the ICU. I’m not sure on Canada’s numbers in our healthcare, but in the States, it’s 5x the cost Mechanical Ventilation Adds 5X the Cost to COVID-19 Care | Premier (premierinc.com)[5x cost ](https://www.premierinc.com/newsroom/blog/mechanical-ventilation-adds-5x-the-cost-to-covid-19-care)
 
The FDA has revoked EUA for Monoclonal Antibody Bamlanivimab because of its ineffectiveness against newer strains while being used for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms , FDA Revokes Emergency Use Authorization for Monoclonal Antibody Bamlanivimab (govdelivery.com)[bam is bad](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USFDA/bulletins/2cd68e3)

Of the currently available vaccines with mutations on the rise and reduced efficacy against them, I believe that Lenzilumab can help save lives and solve multiple problems that we are currently facing. Such as, reduce need for invasive mandatory ventilation, immune to mutant strains, reduce hospital stay ie. More bed availability, fast reoxygenation response, fully administered in 1 day, cost savings on healthcare, etc. I want to put eyes on this because it seems that it’s getting silenced from HF shorts. So much amazing news. 

Again please do your own DD but I think this is a diamond in the rough."

2021-04-30 23:11:32,stocks,"One thing I haven't seen discussed in the comments is bet-sizing. How volatile is the stock, and what proportion of your portfolio risk are you allocating to it? The big spike, by definition, increased the volatility of your position. 

Working it through: 

* Assume I have a target risk of 40% annually on a portfolio of $100,000 (I would strongly advise that more than this is suicidal, but YMMV) - this brings me to a daily expected volatility of about 2.5%, or $2500. 
   * Math: Divide annualized risk by the square root of time to convert to daily units. Two hundred fifty two trading days in a year - so divide by sqrt(252), or approximately 16. 252/16 is approximately 2.5%. 
* Assume also that I want this equally allocated across 10 positions (for simplicity's sake).
   * We can define equal allocation as equal in **cash value** \-- so, 10k in each stock -- but that creates awkward situations where we end up with 10k in 10 positions with 6% volatility (about par for in growth stocks), which would give us a net value at risk of $6000 daily. This translates to an annualized volatility of 96% which is - as mentioned above- suicidal. We don't want this. 
   * A better way to define ""equal allocation"" is by targeting the same **value at risk** for each position; $2500/10 gives us $250, so we're aiming to have $250 at risk daily in each position. 
      * If VOO has a daily volatility of $9 at a price of $384, we can afford about 28 shares ($250/$9 = 28) before hitting our risk target, implying a target allocation of 28\*$384 = $10,800. 
      * A growth stock like SQ, trading at $247 with a daily volatility of $18.50, gets us $250/$18.50 = 13.5 shares, or an allocation of approximately $3,380, to hit the same volatility target. SQ is more volatile than VOO, so we are not able to take a position that is as large without violating our risk management system. 

To answer your allocation question, we need to know how much of your portfolio risk was initially held in CHPT, and how much is held in CHPT now. 

Some combination of the fact that CHPT makes up a comparatively larger portion of your portfolio than before, and that it is a more volatile stock than it was before it spiked, should require you to sell some of your position to keep the risk the same. 

This is the usual way money is taken off the table, with the other way being that something specific changed your feelings about the stock."
2021-05-01 16:31:48,stocks,Perhaps with a nice diversified portfolio in the industry it would be a good bet. Akin to the weed industry I think there will be a large number of competitors and only so many that really make it big.
2021-04-30 22:59:22,stocks,Alpha. I see. So it’s like a relative zero beta strategy.
