2021-05-09 19:44:28,stocks,"Your math is off. Let's think of it in terms of $1,000 increments. A 0.3% expense ratio is $3. So, for every $1,000 you have invested in the ETF,  you pay $3 for them to manage the ETF annually on your behalf. So, it's your decision if you're willing to pay $3 for every $1,000 each year to manage the fund to allow you to be hands off."

2021-05-09 17:46:57,stocks,"With DCF valuation the Enterprise value is calculated with WACC and the companies future cashflow valuated as of today. 

So ev has the companies future potential within its valuation,Based on balance shee, p&l and Cash flow. 

Market Cap is just the share price, which could be seen as an outside perspective / valuation. Its the easy way to validate. But You sure could say that stock prices also have future potential valuated. 

Where i worked we used DCF with enterprise value as the standard method of valuation. We used Market Cap to analyze the Difference between ""Market thoughts"" and Our own valuation (with DCF,Based on the Statements). And we did Benchmarking based on market Cap to get a Feeling for a specific industry."
2021-05-09 17:40:52,stocks,"I'm no expert, but market cap != assets. Also, EV is a good measure of what the company is valued at when they have very large cash reserves, such as for Apple, BRK, SPACs etc."
2021-05-09 17:47:48,stocks,And book value is only the present perspective
2021-05-09 17:49:26,stocks,market cap doesn't equal assets
2021-05-09 18:22:57,stocks,"Ohh I see, so the BV is just a present value of a company. Since its total assets & total liabilities are based on historical costs or if calculated right-the fair value today. While the enterprise value uses the market cap which is based on the market's perspective regarding its assets, hype, management expertise & potential.

I guess I'm having a hard time grasping this idea of why people are using the market cap to evaluate a company. Since the market cap is based on people's perspectives which could be right or wrong. 

So the real work here is determining if the EV is currently or will be less than the real BV, if that's the case then it will be considered as undervalue, am I right?

2021-05-09 18:29:11,stocks,"Not a big fan of the outlook of having the same people who caused and covered up climate change also being the ones in charge of carbon capture. In the end they are just going to use carbon capture as an excuse to extract more oil and call it ""Carbon neutral""."
2021-05-09 19:16:40,stocks,RDS has no green future. Their sustainable investments are the equivalent to virtue signalling. They're not actually trying to become sustainable and won't until they're on the verge of bankruptcy.
2021-05-09 18:50:43,stocks,"They're not the ones being funded by this. Their net income is also very poor, 10 million in revenue to -30 million in net income. They are worth less than $1 billion, which is surprising considering that APD has been in the business of carbon capture, and are pretty well established. I don't see a reason to chase Aker Carbon Capture over APD IMO"

2021-05-09 16:35:14,stocks,"She was loved because her funds were performing well, she’s hated now because they’re doing poorly."
2021-05-09 18:50:55,stocks,"She’s pretty on point about the macro economics trend that could affect stock price. Since December 2020 she was saying overdone stimulus could lead to further inflation that will hurt growth stocks for awhile. Also she said the stimulus will simply lead to quicker tax hike that won’t be good for growth stocks. The most recent video she thinks Corp tax hike will be minimal while cap gains tax hike might simply not be able to pass at all. She also stated these pandemic assistance is the reason for job report miss. More states will likely roll back these pandemic assistance and the average hourly wage growth will likely be lower in the long run, reducing inflation pressures. Hopefully she is right!"
2021-05-09 16:47:59,stocks," If you pull up the charts of the individual stocks in her ARKK fund, you will see that many of them are indeed oversold.  Some have dropped over 60 percent or more from their highs.  And she has not only held them but bought more at these depressed levels.  I'm actually expecting the fund to hit new highs before the end of the year."
2021-05-09 15:42:11,stocks,"If you’ve bought in to these ETFs that hold very volatile stocks, you shouldn’t be expecting quick gains. Be patient and you might profit, but currently growth tech stocks are out of Wall Street fashion. I like Cathie though, she seems smart."
2021-05-09 16:07:55,stocks,"She’s heavily invested in tech. Those stocks exploded in 2020 and have had healthy pull backs in the previous months. She invests in good companies but has way more capital and liquidity to invest with. 

No one should ever follow anyone blindly and take her picks as a bible for 100% success which I feel like people do. At the end of the day people need to do their own DD, but she does offer a good jumping point of companies to look at"
2021-05-09 19:13:58,stocks,"Peter Lynch's fund beat the market by a mile:

[https://thepfengineer.com/2016/07/18/deconstructing-peter-lynch/](https://thepfengineer.com/2016/07/18/deconstructing-peter-lynch/)

Wonder if ark will beating it on the long term."
2021-05-09 19:36:14,stocks,"I like Cathie, it's nice to see something new and have things shaken up.

That said, a lot of the criticism people have for new traders, people that got ""lucky"" because they stared investing during a massive bull run, could also be said of ARKs recent success. That's way too boiled down, but a lot of us may have been investing in a big bubble that made us all look like geniuses... She also has the benefit of a megaphone that people (and markets) follow. Growth stocks on a bull run plus someone people follow saying they just bought, it's a big positive feedback loop that lasts until it doesn't."
2021-05-09 15:37:17,stocks,If people hate her in 2021 then they clearly don’t understand how the stock market works. There will be ups and downs. She can’t hedge against every bet the market throws at her. The fact of the matter is she is still one of the smartest investing minds of the last few years and I learn something new every time I tune into her monthly YouTube podcasts.
2021-05-09 17:09:12,stocks,"I'm curious which of her holdings fans of hers would consider undervalued and why.

You can give a qualitative reason why you expect a certain industry or company to grow, but without pricing in that growth and coming up with an estimated target price, your sentiment is blind to the company's current value. Growth shouldn't have an indiscriminate valuation. You can pay a premium for it, sure, but what's that premium you're paying today?

Most people into these funds have no clue and will get burned in the short and long-term when these absurd valuations regress to the mean. It's already happening and it will likely continue to happen."
2021-05-09 19:06:41,stocks,"I have Arkk but wonder what she is doing with workhorse. She kept buying it even after it was known they weren’t getting the usps contract, then sold it all(or a lot) just this week"
2021-05-09 15:59:59,stocks,"Posted this earlier today in another sub.

Without a doubt Cathie’s strongest attribute is her marketing and sales skills. Her eloquence and optimism is infectious and gets people to put money into her funds. 

No question she did very well last year with the rise in market speculation. 

But this talk of five year returns is quite meaningless in practice when her fund is actually day trading, not holding for five year periods. Some will say this is rebalancing, but this is farcical. Take FSLY - purchased in ARKW on Tuesday, and sold nearly the entire position on Friday.

I don’t own ARK funds but have a few of their underlying holdings. Overall I like her mentality, but personally I think the days of speculative stocks running hot is over for quite a while and expect to see further downturns ahead for ARK funds."
2021-05-09 16:18:33,stocks,Great picture of aunt cathie
2021-05-09 18:16:43,stocks,"I think Cathie is incredibly overly optimistic on a lot of things. Like her reasoning for Tesla going to $3000 in 2025 is laughable. But I have to admit there is a certain logic behind everything she does.

She goes balls to the wall all the time, no matter the market climate. Growth doing great? Buy more growth. Growth going to the dumpster? Buy more growth! It takes a certain personality type to do this and stay committed. Perhaps it’s the religious side of her that enables this level of unwavering faith in her strategy. Can’t say it hasn’t worked out so far.

She doesn’t need all her picks to succeed in order to be successful, and she knows this. If 10% of her investments go up 1000% or more it’s worth it even if the rest goes down 50%. When growth comes back into favor people will be singing her praises once again. It probably won’t happen this year though."
2021-05-09 16:31:04,stocks,"Not an ark investor myself. Any critique of Cathie that I’ve seen has either been without substance - just a simple ‘she is crazy’ or about her being religious. What a load of crap. She may be crazy, maybe not, but every single post about her means nothing unless it is a logical critique of her estimating method - thats all that matters."
2021-05-09 18:58:51,stocks,I just think she’s too Tesla heavy. Live by Tesla die by Tesla
2021-05-09 17:29:07,stocks,"I’m not an ARK investor for a specific reason: “5 year horizon”. I believe she knows what she’s doing, and that many of the companies she has conviction in will grow such that their valuations will improve and set up surges over the next few years. 

I simply don’t care to wait for those surges."
2021-05-09 19:23:28,stocks,She also said in the beginning of February that we were not in a growth bubble. I made the mistake of believing her.
2021-05-09 19:55:47,stocks,"I don't think that very many people are switching their opinions on Cathie Wood. There have always been some people to loved Cathie Wood and some that hated her.

I think that her haters are just less vocal during time periods when her funds are doing well and get more vocal during time periods when her funds are not doing well since they then currently have more ammo to use for their arguments. And vice-versa for the people that love Cathie Wood; they get more silent during the bad time periods and more vocal during the good time periods."
2021-05-09 16:26:33,stocks,Anyone know her 5-year performance not including Tesla off top of head?
2021-05-09 16:43:13,stocks,">let's not forget she was right with her earlier Tesla valuation when everyone called her crazy.

She is a master marketer. Look at all the attention she gets. This could be a self fulfilling prophecy in that all the people actively sought to make the valuation happen. I suppose you could call it Herd mentality. I don't *necessarily* call it genius.

I agree with a lot of your positions on this.

I think its cute that she forecasts 25% CAGR (from 15%) just because some of here picks have gone from 400 P/E to 200 P/E. What if they go to 25 P/E over the next year? I guess she'll be primed for 100% cagr, right?

If I'm wrong, I'll gladly eat crow. I'm rooting for her, honestly. A lot of people have their money on the line. I'm Just skeptical.

Great write up. Thank you.

Edit: grammar"
2021-05-09 19:07:11,stocks,same people who worship her are trying to get rich off animal coins right now..they just sit on their phones all with a calculator dreaming of what they are going to do with all the piles of cash.
2021-05-09 18:08:35,stocks,"I liked the thesis a year ago, 6 months ago, and still do. In for a penny, in for a pound, I'll keep investing. 

How does the saying go.... Oh yeah.... ""Buy low sell high"". Well it's low now. Might go lower, but do you have more upside or downside at this point."
2021-05-09 16:00:15,stocks,"It all happened with she started her Joan of ark religious bull shit- this shit will tank - she jinxed herself giving away he bat shit crazy religious views. Look at her crazy ass eyes- she became a cliché ""just invest in Ark"" and when it becomes that popular its time to dump however that doesn't always apply  (I.E Vanguard)."
2021-05-09 17:22:11,stocks,This is the way
2021-05-09 19:02:53,stocks,Jesus will save her book it
2021-05-09 19:57:13,stocks,Can't be mad because I only hold X!
2021-05-09 17:39:03,stocks,Exactly. This sub wouldn't stop talking about ARK last summer. It's what got me to invest in it around August. I was up 65% in less than 6 months. Now it's fallen to 7% which is lower than what I am up in VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market). I'm up 22% in the same period with VTI. Sucks for people who got into ARK 2-3 months ago. They're probably down 50% right now.
2021-05-09 18:55:23,stocks,"She’s certainly not a supporter for bidenomics which this sub is so passionate about. She’s against tax hike, wanted targets stimulus and just stated pandemic assistance is leading to missed jobs report. She has been saying she would like to see a split Congress since December last year. I agree with all her points. This sub. However would be making endless threads to trash her if more here watched her videos."
2021-05-09 17:47:52,stocks,They're still up like 300% YOY
2021-05-09 19:28:56,stocks,"You're more bullish on the Nasdaq than I am then, based off what I've seen I am neutral to leaning bearish until further notice.

I was more optimistic until it sold off on Tuesday, now I suspect it's going to be rangebound at best until July and your absolute best case is probably 15.5k-16k this year. 

It's not that they have to follow what the Nasdaq does, it's that if they really get going, it's likely that the Nasdaq is going to have it too (in the last couple weeks before the growth selloff got started, the Nasdaq had jumped almost 8%). But despite that comeback on Thursday, I am not feeling it anymore in this land."
2021-05-09 15:40:13,stocks,It probably has to do something with new investors buying near the February highs and not fully understanding the risks of the fund.
2021-05-09 16:42:21,stocks,I think a lot of people don't hate her because of the past few months but instead just hate her overall strategy and analysis.
2021-05-09 17:09:11,stocks,I never liked her in 2020 eswell
2021-05-09 17:42:52,stocks,Some people think that active fund managers are charlatans and hate her for that reason
2021-05-09 15:41:03,stocks,Based on what?
2021-05-09 16:47:34,stocks,"Meh, I think she means the 5 year holding period. She has held a number of positions multiple years. I cut my FSLY position a month or so ago because of multiple reasons and if my thesis changes on a particular stock then I cut ties with it. 
Her top holdings have been consistent and I think a lot of funds would seem like they’re day trading if they sent you a daily email of their activity.
I’m similar and don’t own the funds but do agree on a few of her holdings. The strategy is sound, the problem is it’s not an “all weather” portfolio so it’ll have peaks and troughs when sentiment changes and she does little to hedge the downturns besides averaging down. 

I agree most of the haters on Reddit bought after it was already up 100% and they’re upset about being down now and question the strategy and picks."
2021-05-09 16:47:06,stocks,"Agree fully, she simply is got a cult following and people saw her ad a profit prophet. Once her midas touch fades bagholders either got angry (and hate her) or fell into cognitive dissonance and make up excuses for her ""temporary setbacks"".



History doesn't lie, Ark is a next gen atlas funds. Stellar performance at first, then setbacks happen. Desperate to regain lost money/reputation they take on more risk and soon enough lose it all. People forget all about it after a few years until a new star is risking beating the market and everyone things ""this time it'll be different"""
2021-05-09 16:16:27,stocks,"This seems true to me also. She buys/sells so frequently. 

I have a little ARKX just to see where that goes in time.  But I avoid buying the others right now for just these reasons."
2021-05-09 16:10:27,stocks,"completely agree

when i listen to her, i genuinely feel inspired and have complete faith in her. then, i see arkk go down 3 months in a row."
2021-05-09 17:45:06,stocks,"I reduced my ARKK a bit after seeing how much she day trades. Their expertise is not in day trading. I liked them because it seemed like they did good analyses and bought high conviction stocks to hold.

&#x200B;

I’m also concerned that maintaining the same strategy will work as their assets under management grows."
2021-05-09 17:10:22,stocks,"You haven’t looked in the right places. Financial Times for example published exactly what you asked, a logical critique of her method to calculate a Tesla price target, and it was brutal."
2021-05-09 16:59:03,stocks,"There is well founded criticism against Ark Invest. Their latest Tesla target price estimate - $1,500 bear case, $4,000 bull case in next 5 years - is a good example. I am not capable of providing an alternative calculation. Still, my common sense tells me that estimate is not from this world."
2021-05-09 16:36:26,stocks,This.
2021-05-09 19:19:19,stocks,"The thing that's funny is that Tesla is probably the main reason it's not uglier based off things that I have read and I am no Tesla fan.

I haven't looked for myself, but even though it topped in January it's only down 23ish% from ATH right now, and apparently there have been things that are still down even more than this.

Edit: Here are some examples:

TDOC: -48.36%

Zillow: -40%

Spot: -34.33%

ZM: -48%

CRSP: -49%

DKNG: -32.5%

In case you're wondering, I like some of these names. There was a while where I would've considered TDOC and CRSP's technology is very interesting."
2021-05-09 17:06:47,stocks,"Why would you remove Tesla from her performance? Because it did well? Growth investing usually involves planting a bunch of seeds; many don't grow like expected, and a few grow huge."
2021-05-09 16:44:51,stocks,"With some of her stocks, for sure. Many of them exploded after ARK bought them. However with Tesla there is no way she could’ve pumped it to a $600 billion dollar market cap."
2021-05-09 19:47:54,stocks,There should be a bot that posts this phrase in every reddit thread just to save others time
2021-05-09 18:03:51,stocks,Hi.  I’m those people.  Yup.
2021-05-09 18:39:06,stocks,Everyone who got into anything 2 to 3 months ago is probably down 40%. look at that alt energy boom and bust.
2021-05-09 18:20:05,stocks,"Mhm. I’m still very bullish about ark. I think their research is top notch, and at these prices I think it’s a good entry into their funds."
2021-05-09 18:08:33,stocks,"Vti has the top stocks and has over 3000 holdings. so I wouldn't compare the two

I own 6 of the top ten in vti"
2021-05-09 18:20:29,stocks,Mhm.
2021-05-09 19:46:08,stocks,"I agree that the Nasdaq is likely to remain range bound.  I actually prefer this to happen so we can consolidate the gains.  However you have to understand that the averages are heavily skewed towards a number of mega cap stocks,  perhaps the most skewed in history.   Over the past 3 months, we have had not just a correction but an outright annihilation of growth stocks, some dropping as much as 70 percent.  And the indices not only didn't fall with them.  They actually went higher.  They completely shrugged it off.  Therefore it is not out of the realm of possibility that these names, many of which make up her innovation portfolio, which she has continued to accumulate and average down on, make some sort of recovery and eventually lead the markets higher to close the year."
2021-05-09 16:36:02,stocks,"Absolutely this. People who bought last year saw some good gains, people this year haven’t. It’s completely emotional IMO"
2021-05-09 17:48:33,stocks,"I bought in during February and I have lost thousands.  I am not happy about it but it's the risk you take. I wish i had that money to invest elsewhere but I'm holding.  I am much more upset at the money I lost on BB.  Still holding those bags, too. Just hoping it goes green by retirement age."
2021-05-09 16:48:49,stocks,"Well, the strategies and analysis has been the same as in 2020"
2021-05-09 17:16:42,stocks,Well good for you for being consistent.
2021-05-09 17:29:49,stocks,One of the few here
2021-05-09 16:07:23,stocks,What do you mean based on what? Have you been living under a rock these past couple of years?
2021-05-09 16:25:53,stocks,"I also question the timing of a lot of her picks - I get that she is very bullish on some companies, but I don’t feel like they’re really doing proper valuations and/or risk assessment.

Some examples, investing in Coinbase and UiPath right from the IPO at sky high valuations. Picking up Palantir after the 250% hype jump. Investing in riskier SPACs at a big premium to NAV, etc

I agree with the other poster here though, I think her funds provide good ideas of companies to further investigate."
2021-05-09 17:13:52,stocks,My comment is about redditors more than financial analysts. I’m sure there exists some critique in the professional world.
2021-05-09 17:11:03,stocks,Did you just say there is some critique out there but you don’t know what it is? And then say ‘common sense’ and yet also indicate you don’t have the skills to assess? Huh?
2021-05-09 19:04:03,stocks,"Really? Seems a vast majority of stocks are still overvalued, unless you're only looking for a 5% return."
2021-05-09 18:39:06,stocks,VTI is exactly what you should be comparing to. If you can’t beat VTI (including expenses) then join VTI.
2021-05-09 19:49:48,stocks,"...the nasdaq didn't exactly shrug it off, although it didn't fall as hard as ARKK and both of the indices here rebounded to set new ATHs last month.

I mean it dropped over 11% at its lowest intraday.

I do not think it's that likely you see growth and innovation perform without the Nasdaq being awake at the same time and with what I've seen, if ARK sets a new ATH this year, you'll probably see the Nasdaq at 17k+ this year and although I thought that was happening in February, I no longer think so."
2021-05-09 17:56:52,stocks,"Hi, are you me?"

If the stock market were to crash the day after you bought in, you might not have that money back in 3 years (in full). However, if you think you can do without it for 10 years, throw it in either SPY, QQQ, or VTI. There are some key differences between each of them, so don't just close your eyes and pick. Look into each, and make a decision on which one you think is the best buy for you. VTI would be considered the safest, but tends to have lower returns, QQQ would tend to be riskier, but the average returns are better than SPY.

At the end of the day, you need to put a bit of risk on the table if you want to make money. Each of these indexes will recover from a crash, but the question is can you wait for them to recover, and invest into it every month if the worst was to happen and the markets crashed the day after you bought. There are methods of lowering your risk of getting hit hard by a crash, namely trailing stop losses, but nothing is perfect.

Sure, if you’re talking about a company in which something has fundamentally changed, there’s a time to cut your losses.

Is this sound logic when participating in a pump and dump? No, but this logic isn’t for that. It applies to holding onto what you believe in, hopefully because you’ve either done your research on the individual companies you’re invested in or you’re invested in the broad market. And you’re invested for the long term.

This is only true if the price isn't going to come back up. You're quite literally not losing anything by holding waiting for a rebound on a stock that's pitched downward.

You've heard this saying, so I'm sure you've also heard that the two types of people who make the most money in the market are those that are either dead or forgot their passwords. Time in the market is always the best strategy regardless of the price movements of a stock. Of course, this is assuming you invest in quality businesses. 

In the 90s/00s, my aunt took around $20,000 and invested in a bunch of different tech companies. This included Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, and Amazon. Obviously, there was a big loser in there: Cisco. She finally recouped her initial investment on Cisco in 2017, though, so imagine if she had sold? But then there's Amazon. She could have panic sold on the fall from $100 in the dot-com bubble -- but she didn't. And she still hasn't sold. There was about a decade where she could have sold and taken a loss, but she didn't. Now she's obviously massively up on that investment.

You don’t want to be a bad holder. But you also don’t want to sell early, especially for a loss. This is why people need to make up their own minds on their plays, and have an idea on what they want, and why that’s feasible, what to do if not, and reevaluate on significant changes. 

Eventually, it gets to be timing and most people aren’t successful with consistently timing in a positive manner. But that’s why it’s good to have your own lines drawn. And why it’s more positive mentally to be up from yesterday and not down from today’s high."

The market works on sentiment and never on logical thinking.

I always say there are 2 different types of people, investors and these are the ones that buy and hold for long, and traders and those are the ultimate speculators who are constantly trying to time the market and selling when things go up and buying when things go down, and irrespective on what they say, it stays a big gambling discipline. 

However I am working closely with a major trading and investment firm and what they are trying todo  is make use of quantum computers and advanced algorithms, AI and ML to have a better more informative view about the market behavior and possible directions so they can make as much informative trading decisions as possible.

This approach by no mean makes trading and investment a perfect science however it reduces the error Margins lower than the traditional speculative approach."
2021-05-09 17:23:01,stocks,"The OP needs to add a little more detail to make this solid.

When dealing with GOOD stocks and investments, you don't lose until you sell.

I get where this is coming from, you have all these meme stocks and coins blowing around and people are screaming this phrase to help their own investments.

For every stock that actually holds high, a dozen have cost people big money regarding these that people generally say don't sell.

Let me make it clear, no one knows the future, but a solid EFT or market index fund will most likely always go green in the long run.  Blackberry and  Palantir Technologies Inc along with many of those weed stocks may never recover, and if they do, they may perform below market performance along the way as they have been.   (Yes, I use to have Blackberry and still have a little PLTR to remind me not be stupid.)

In summary, yes, you ""technically"" only lose when you sell, but if you are holding a stock 30-40% down that keeps performing poorly, it might be a subpar investment compared to Index funds even.  Worse, some companies don't recover, some can be down 80% ten years later, others go bankrupt.

So make sure your investing in something solid, not the regional meme."

Plenty of times my port has been down by massive amounts and I managed to wait it out and rebound and then some. Of course had I sold before it dropped that much, bought at the bottom, and saw it rebound I would have made significantly more, but that is me just reacting to hindsight. 

If anything I have experienced more potential loss by seeing some marginal gains, selling when things dip a bit to lock in those gain, only to see it moon immediately afterwards and me do a fomo buy in again. 

The point of the phrase ""You only lose when you sell"" isn't to be some WSB, diamond handed mantra. It's meant to tell people that seeing some dips -  even big ones - doesn't necessarily mean it will be a losing investment in the long run.

So you should consider money in stocks as 100% lost until the day you decide to sell and do something with it."

They just contribute fixed amount  periodically. During the covid crash, a lot of my client didn't even know/care  that their portfolio is down by xxx %. They keep on contributing and eventually it will be worth more than what they put in."
2021-05-09 16:55:52,stocks,"People who refuse to sell a stock at huge loss and use the money to buy something else are often not thinking straight.

Let’s say you are down 30% on a position. What do you do?
I think when you are down so much there is a tendency to feel that switching to another stock won’t give enough upside to get you even, so certain people stick to what they have in stubborn hope borne from desperation.

This is stupid. If this worked, a good general investing strategy would be to buy whatever dropped the most. And in this specific case, to sell your stock at 30% loss and buy one that’s down 50% or more.

“You don’t lose until you sell” is what often people are told, or tell to themselves, when they are desperate for hope.
I see it mostly used as a consolation, not the foundation of detached decisions."

I think a lot of new investors will give up on investing after jumping in and out of positions based on short term performance."

2021-05-09 17:42:59,stocks,"""You don't lose until you sell"" is only true when price drops are a result of an inefficient market rather than underlying company performance.

For example, I bought WDC and Seagate the other day, only for it to crash 5% immediately after I bought, because Yellen said something about interest rates possibly needing to go up to combat inflation. She's the treasury secretary, she's not even part of the fed anymore so she has no impact on interest rates, but her words were enough to rattle the market and drive a selloff of tech stocks.

I told myself ""I don't lose until I sell"", because I was still confident in my conviction that hard drive demand will grow significantly in Q2 and beyond, and that WDC would be able to use the profit to reduce their debt burden, reinstate their dividend, providing solid future returns even if investors aren't willing to pay much for my shares. The stocks were down 5%, so I did miss an opportunity to buy cheaper, but I was still confident that I got in at a fair price.

Then a day or two later on Friday, a bad jobs report came out, so the stock fully recovered and went up some because people felt interest rates would remain low, and now I'm up money on the investment.

In this case, on both days, there was a significant amount of volatility in the stock, but pretty much nothing changed about the underlying security I owned. The only thing that changed was the risk appetite of the market.

I have a very simple philosophy when I buy any individual stock- don't buy it unless I'm comfortable holding it for 20 years. If my investment depends on someone else being willing to pay me more for it in the short term, it's not a good investment.

On the contrary though, if you buy a stock, and then objectively bad things happen to the company(ie you bought Sears and their stock kept falling as their downfall continued), then yes, ""you don't lose until you sell"" is a fallacy."
2021-05-09 17:43:35,stocks,"I saw that -10% would need a 11% gain to break even and -20% would need 25%, -50% would need 100% gain to break even.

2021-05-09 17:45:31,stocks,"i think there is some value in it. it's not always the case but look at it from the perspective of someone who is holding a stock that is valued fairly and has a good future but is currently down, and I think it makes more sense. it's a justification for not selling just because you're down, not one for holding on forever despite the fact that the market has realized a given stock is dramatically overvalued."
2021-05-09 17:47:24,stocks,Sure but you could average down to a point where you might not lose

2021-05-09 19:04:26,stocks,Literally one of the first things Wall Street Pros tell up and coming traders to do is to cut your losses and ride your gains. Truth hurts.
2021-05-09 19:06:16,stocks,"This is why I learned to trust my emotions. If it goes down after you buy and you feel some type of way about it then you’re over exposed and need to decrease the position.

To prevent yourself from feeling some type of way about the price going down, only buy things you have strong long-term convictions about.

There’s another trick to get out also. Sell your shares at a loss and use a small fraction of the money to buy monthly call options for equal to or more than the shares you sold. If the price bounces, yay you win back way more than you lost. If it keeps going down and your calls expire worthless, well that sucks but at least most of your money has been protected and IS LIKELY BEING DEPLOYED SOMEWHERE ELSE by then which is the whole point of this strategy. It buys you time to get over the loss and make a rational decision."
2021-05-09 19:06:18,stocks,"Yeah, I can see how it might be true in some cases, like real estate, where there's a chance of it going back up if you hold it long enough. But generally speaking of the losses are significant regardless of whether you sold or not, you lost."
2021-05-09 19:08:29,stocks,"I get your point. It's not so much investing advise as it is advise for people who are freaking out about short term news. It can certainly be problematic if taken as investment advise. Your definitely seeing it more as there are a shit load of new investors on this sub who want to get rich quick ""the safe way"" but don't realize that the way you make money safely is by playing the long game. Short term deviations and bad days don't mean shit in the long run. When your playing the long game think in terms of shares of the company, not the value they are worth. If you want to be invested in that company still then you are doing good, the share value shouldn't be a concern unless you are not sure about the company fundamentals anymore or your at the end of your ride."

This is unlike futures, where gains and losses are applied to your account at the end of each trading day. 

I started my a new job in Jan 2020 and began contributing to a 401k immediately. By mid March 2020, I was down almost 30%. So I should have sold? 

Hell no, I can ride nominal loss and sleep much better at night knowing that I’m invested. Attempting to time the market is much worse advice than buy-and-hold/DCA stocks and ETFs you believe in and have researched."

2021-05-09 14:54:09,stocks,"Wrong. Over the Long term, 30+ years stock returns are nearly 100% correlated with the earnings of the underlying business. Therefore the worth of your portfolio is the risk adjusted net earnings potential of your portfolio between now and your sales date. In this case risk is defined as the probability that future earnings fail to keep pace with the expected growth rate.

So the value of an investment at any point of time doesn’t decrease as market prices fall. Market prices may fall because the earnings potential have decreased, but the value of your investment have nothing to do with the $ amount displayed on your brokerage account. That number is just the amount you currently have available for liquidation.

That said I agree with the sentiment that you shouldn’t hold on to a loosing stock. If you were wrong about a stock and the business quality have seen a permanent decline, you may want to cut your losses, assuming the current price is deemed overly optimistic."

2021-05-09 17:45:19,stocks,This seems like a simplistic view of trading and one liners. I generally believe with a few other rules that companies are based multiple of revenue. That multiple is dependent on a lot of things fructuates on a lot of things. There I just invest in growing real realized revenue as a base rule. So if a company fluctuates I ask if there revenue grow has changed and if I still have confidence in the business.

You have paper winnings, and also paper losses.  

It is NOT a loss until you sell.  And if you don't need the money, it's simply an interesting data point for you to look at.  

What, you think that a portfolio that declines 20% is somehow worth less?

* Did you or did you not invest in companies?
* Are you still not the same percentage of a shareholder in those companies?
* Did the company somehow also decrease in value?

Again, if you think that a stock price decline of AAPL by 10% makes them 10% less of a company, you have no clue as to what stocks correspond to."

2021-05-09 18:47:26,stocks,"If you're investing with money you can afford to lose, what's wrong with leaving it alone?

I bought NIO at $6 and $7, then it crashed down to $1.60 or so, so I bought a bit more and then ignored it for a long time. I call stocks that do this ""lottery tickets"", and every so often one that I've practically forgotten about does what NIO did and compensates for all the others. I sold enough of NIO at $60 to cover my original investment plus my original investment on a bunch of other ""lottery tickets"", plus a bit. Combined with the much safer parts of my portfolio, overall it seems to not be a bad strategy.

As another example, I'm currently sitting on a 60% loss on QS, but I don't care because during its initial spike 6 months ago I recouped my original investment. I'm leaving it alone for years because if it ever pulls a Tesla I think it'll be funny."

2021-05-09 18:52:17,stocks,100% disagree. The idea of only losing if you sell is quite accurate. Just because its valued less at the time doesnt mean it will continue to go down. It can go up later so paper handing can cause you to lose money. Warren Buffets biggest investing strategy is long term compounding effect. He says himself he may go negative but he holds because he knows it will go back up. Just do your DD and if you have faith in the company then hold. You only lose when you sell.
2021-05-09 19:00:29,stocks,"Lol if you sell it better be cause the reason you bought no longer stands. If you buy just for price then you deserve to be a paperhand baby when it dips.

It‘s worth might fluctuate but you still own the same amount of shares you bought so you lose nothing. If you buy a house and the real estate market crashes you still haven‘t lost a thing.

Too many people don’t understand opportunity cost. Holding onto a stock down 10% hoping it’ll go back up so you can break even. You could sell at a loss and put that money into a stock that *is* going higher and make your money back and possibly more. 

Of course, are plenty of situations where holding onto a stock at a loss is the right thing to do, but sometimes it’s best to cut your losses and move on.

Theres some good points you made, but also alot of weak ones.

If a person invests, they do their due diligence.
If i like the company and it’s fundamentals and numbers, the stock will go up.

It’s more or less a statistical fact that stocks only go up, this has mostly to do with inflation.

With that being said, a stock can always go down...
Ask yourself, why is it going down?
Did the fundamentals change?
Was there bad news?

No?
Good, then your due dilligence and opinion should not have changed.

Yes?
Maybe you should re-evaluate or update your due diligence for future prospects.

See, let’s say NIO, i’m down about 10% on it now and nothing in the fundamentals has changed.

It’s still an amazing brand with a cult-like following and i like the company.

I see it easily going to 100-200 within the next 3 years.

I do have to say that the current market is not one i have faith in or one i would invest in, with all the corruption and fraud going on.
I expect that it will turn into a bear market soon.

The bear market fact however does not mean i will sell my nio, i’m okay with holding stocks for 5 years, and good companies will always grow."

If I had sold at any point once it dropped below $250 I would have lost money. Instead, I just held and then a month or so later it climbed back, all the way to $300-something, although I sold in the $270 range when it temporally dipped after hitting $280 just to make sure I didn’t miss the window again.

Sure, there is no guarantee of a bounce back like that, but it proved the saying true - not selling meant no loss."

Why was the biggest company on the planet worth 800b and is now worth 2.2t with a very small change in growth. I think Apple is a solid investment, but at the same time, part of me can't really explain why we collectively defined it worth 800b a few years ago and 2.2t today."

Day traders worry about the day to day price changes and lost opportunity costs. Folks planning for a retirement have other things on their mind- and better things to focus on then the exact cost day to day.

Different scenarios warrant different responses. If the fundamentals are there and you believe in the company, selling would be a mistake. As for MSFT, their business was peaked out when the crash came and it lacked vision for the future. Hindsight is always 20/20 though."

2021-05-09 16:36:37,stocks,"In a simplified analysis like that sure, it’s hard to wrap your head around it’s valuation. The M2 money supply increased 26% in 2020 alone, not taking into account all the money that’s been added thus far in 2021. In addition to that, int. rates are the lowest they have ever been(sure they’re trending up now, but they are still at pretty much all time lows). 

Valuations soar when there’s excess money in the system coupled with low interest rates. This money needs to go somewhere, and government securities are paying out less than the expected inflation rate, which means a lot of money is going into the stock market instead. AAPL is the biggest company, with the most influence, and arguably the biggest beneficiary of stimulus checks to consumers. They generate the most FCF, have ever-expanding businesses, and like Tesla most of its fan-base is a cult. You could’ve potentially made this argument with almost any other company, but AAPL is a behemoth and thus valued as one."

Basically, what you're giving up is an opportunity cost.  You can sell half way through the loss, and then buy in at the bottom.  Ok, you reduced your loss, and you gained more money in the end when it goes back up.  


However, if you sell at the bottom, and then only buy back when it's up half way, you've managed to lose even more money.  


So, when you say you only lose money when you sell, it's true.  At that point, if your stock turns around, you're actually losing even more money unless you beat that stock.  


This is all relative, but you only realize a loss once you sell.  Anyone saying otherwise is trading and not investing."
2021-05-09 18:14:49,stocks,"A contributing factor for the inflation of market caps for the mega cap tech companies (and all companies whose value is derived from far-in-the future cash flows) is low interest rates. The opportunity cost of investors money is low because interest rates are so low. If you remember from your corporate finance days, the value of a business is the sum of discounted future cash flows. Low interest rates means low discount rate. In more ""normal interest times"" you would find cash flows outside of about 10 years to not be worth very much, and those outside of 15 to be too negligible to consider. With rock bottom rates you find that cash flows 20 years out are material in forecasting the overall value of the company.

This is why we see the NASDAQ dip on good jobs reports. Good employment means the prospect of the Fed raising rates, which in turn would give higher opportunity costs to capital and less value on cash flows 20 years away. Especially companies that don't have much earnings and won't for some time yet; their market caps will be particularly adversely affected by any change in expectations for interest rates to go higher.

This is only one contributing factor; though it's large enough to see the NASDAQ add or subtract $500 billion in value of aggregate market caps on the date of a Fed report.

Edit: and I guess it's worth explicitly saying that interest rates were moved to rock bottom at the beginning of the pandemic, further exacerbating the inflation of mega cap companies. It isn't only current interest rate levels, but expected future interest rates. Before the pandemic unemployment was at a multi decade low, and rates had already been on a schedule to tick up over time (albeit in small increments and with a relatively low ultimate ceiling while inflation is claimed to be as low as it is (whether inflation is truly low or not is a debate all in itself))."

Don’t waste time or potentially lose more to reach a “cost basis” that doesn’t really matter. All that matters is how much you still have invested in that company, and that you still believe (with time) in that company to succeed and grow your investment.

2021-05-09 18:45:53,stocks,"Why not up and to the left? 

I’m just being facetious. Seriously though, there’s no such thing as “undervalued” a company is worth exactly how much it’s worth.  If the market thought it was undervalued it would already be worth more. 

I will also say fundamentals aren’t that meaningful either. 

And I will also say that picking stocks is a fools game. You don’t know what you’re doing. If you beat the market you’ve only gotten lucky.

These all speak of timing the market. 

The real answer is to just do 401k style tactic of consistently buying into broad funds at regular intervals and never stopping until you’re ready to retire."

2021-05-09 17:47:25,stocks,"That’s why you should just learn to do fundamental analysis. 

It’s not rocket surgery by any means, traders just lack the conviction to hold through thick and thin. If you thought Apple was a really cool innovator when they released the iPhone, and then sold a few years later, you would’ve made a decent chunk of change. But if you had been a forward thinker, while also having the constitution to hold, you would’ve made a shit load more than buying an index. And all you would’ve done is bought part of the index."
2021-05-09 17:53:24,stocks,It’s more like the Romans acquired Christianity.

No, you'd say it was a cult that doesn't really do anything, and you'll never convince the Romans to leave their pagan Gods.  But lo and behold, we have like 15 centuries of Christianity dominating most of the world, while the Romans disappeared with their solid fundamentals

Haha I like this metaphor, but I think Apple market cap would make it the roman empire not Christianity!"
2021-05-09 17:42:18,stocks,"Yeah I just took Apple as an example, because I've been throwing my paychecks in this company from 2010 to 2020 not because I don't believe in them. I might be wrong about all of this and apple might keep on growing like this for the next few years, but I just don't think its normal."
2021-05-09 16:37:12,stocks,"There wasn’t 300% inflation in 1 year.

The only thing I see that materially changed Apple in my view is the validation of quality of their new desktop chips. But not 3x valuation worth."
2021-05-09 16:40:09,stocks,"And inflation is what, 2% yearly tops? That is a far cry from explaining the massive jump we saw. Apple is worth a lot more without selling more (like 5% tops) and inflation (2%). Ain't no way its worth 15% more then last year and certainly not anything above"
2021-05-09 16:34:15,stocks,"I know they had a stock split..... a stock split doesn't increase your market cap.... Also didn't apple also have endless growth in 2019? Revenue in 2018 was 265b, in 2020 it was 274b. It is only a growth of 3-4% meanwhile the market cap is 250% higher. I hope they do another stock split and manage to growth their revenue to 290b to then justify a valuation of 14t in 4 years. 

We are in a bubble powered by cheap credits and it will come crashing down at some point, might be in 5 years, might be tomorrow, but I highly doubt peoples that take the approach of ""time in the market beat timing the market"" will see the same type of returns  as the one we got in the 2010s."
2021-05-09 18:27:02,stocks,"Honestly, I don't really consider what I do as ""investing"". I am trader, I don't really believe in most companies valuation right now, but this irrational exuberance in the market has been really profitable and make me too scared to sit on the sideline. 

I usually try to hold a position for a maximum of six months, so it definitely like a lost to me when I feel the need to buy a Lucid cap because I've became a long term investor."
2021-05-09 18:41:10,stocks,">This is why we see the NASDAQ dip on good jobs reports. Good employment means the prospect of the Fed raising rates, which in turn would give higher opportunity costs to capital and less value on cash flows 20 years away. 

Yeah I know, this is why I am not marrying any positions and I don't really believe the stock market (or at least big cap) will growth as much as it did in the 2010s. Our rates won't stay that low forever and there will be a return to reality at some point (I guess its already kind of happened already with a few small cap companies and SPACs)"

Each investor and each portfolio has its own goals. Only you can decide when it's time to cut your losses. And, yes, sometimes dumping a stock is the right move for a portfolio."
2021-05-09 16:23:57,stocks,"Yup. Because everyone knew it was the top of the bubble and that tech wouldn’t recover for a decade... Ideally selling at the top and reinvesting at the bottom is going to give you the best returns, but that’s just not realistic whatsoever."

2021-05-09 16:12:12,stocks,"Still hard to say. Like I said in the same thread, why is Apple worth 2.2T now and was only worth 800b, 2 years ago with close to no growth?  I think Apple is actually one of the safest investment you can do. But, this exponential growth seem to be symptomatic of a bubble. I personally don't really understand why we collectively decided it was worth 800b 2 years ago, to now think the same company is now worth 2.2tT. I mean it very well might be a 6.6T company in 2023 and 19.8T company in 2025, but I feel this growth is surreal and isn't grounded in reality. 

I am still bullish, because I know peoples will keep on buying, but I don't really see the future in those big cap companies will be as good as the 2010s (And 2020) has been for us."

2021-05-09 16:21:37,stocks,"To be fair, I did this with Lucid earlier this year. I had bought a lot of shares at $14.90 thinking this stock would get to $35 or $40 at some point. Turn out its got there in a few days, I decided to sell 33% to get my initial investment +5-10% back and let everything else invested in the company. I lost a shitload of unrealized gains by not selling at the top, but right now the stocks I have in the business costed me ""nothing"". I respected my investment strategy and didn't sell when its went down (even if I probably should have done so, since it might never get back to that level)"
2021-05-09 14:57:25,stocks,"I do agree. However, at least these people had enough sense to pull out after seeing their security rise in price. Some people will just let things ride in perpetuity because they don’t have a target price, no means to lock in profits, etc."

2021-05-09 16:14:47,stocks,"Lol yeah this is real. I made close to 100% of my portfolio in January with meme stocks and lost a few years of salary in the next few months, because I was taking riskier and riskier bets. I am still up 20% YTD, but down around 50% from my top."
2021-05-09 14:54:21,stocks,There's nothing wrong with treating your money with different levels of risk though there are literally funds that revolve around different levels of risk. I think you're reading into the saying wrong but that's just my opinion.

2021-05-09 15:11:30,stocks,"Thanks. And yeah, options seem to give better control."
2021-05-09 15:31:24,stocks,"Whether that was a smart move or not is all going to depend on what you do with those funds now. If you’ve bought back in for the same amount of shares at a lower cost then you’ve locked in a smart move from the day you sold them (assuming it’s in an account where wash sale rules don’t apply).

If you haven’t then the only thing cutting losses does is guarantee a loss from your initial investment. There’s nothing positive to the action, only a confirmed negative.

Now, there can be a positive, if you find somewhere to park that money that will outperform those equities over the next 5-10 years. Because chances are that all or most of those stocks you cut losses on will be back at those levels and quite possibly have blown far through them 5-10 years from now.

So it may seem like a time for back patting but not even half the battle has been won, maybe only 10% of the battle has begun. The other 90% will come from having to make a very smart move now since you’ve already locked yourself into a disadvantage by selling for a loss."
2021-05-09 18:50:49,stocks,So you're not investing -- you're trading on speculative plays.

2021-05-09 19:27:39,stocks,"Fundamentals are everything, and picking stocks is absolutely a thing you should do, specifically in areas with which you are deeply familiar. For example, my profession places me in frequent close contact with a set of tools and services in a way that gives me a deeper knowledge about these products than the vast majority of people. I would be a fool not to use that knowledge to pick stocks that represent the companies who are just killing it in my field."
2021-05-09 18:56:14,stocks,"I would disagree. This reminds me of a video I watched a long time ago about an investor who kept buying shares in a company and stock was sliding. He recommended buying at 20, then 10, then 5, and even at 3. 

The reason was that fundamentally the company had assets worth far more than the share price and even though it was no longer profitable, returned upwards of 40 dollars a share on liquidation of assets. 

Yes, a share is worth what people are willing to pay at a current moment. The intrinsic value behind the fundamentals of the company and assets they own could be higher or lower than current share price. 

Finding the value YOU are willing to pay for partial ownership in a company is something everyone needs to do for themselves. I haven’t been investing for that long (early 2017) but have consistently demolished the returns in my Roth IRA and even though I contribute far less to my personally managed account,  I have surpassed it in value several times over. None of my shares are in micro caps, a few small caps that I truly believe in, and the rest in companies who are going to be around for a long time. I purchase the same percentage of the same companies every month in my active portfolio and keep a cash reserve for large events like market corrections and crashes. Yes I use options to hedge long positions during extreme volatility. 

I don’t disagree that ETF’s aren’t amazing tools though. QQQ, VTI, SPY, some examples of great places to park money if YOU don’t want to try to actively manage or just DCA over time and still partake in the gains of the overall market.

Not a chance

Imo there are some assets that are “bubbly” but it’s more of an issue in terms of economics than anything else. In the stock market, there are some sectors that are in a bubble for sure. Such as renewables, some tech, and almost anything to do with EV.

Edit: I think the correction on the overvalued stocks is already occurring. For example, take a look at Fastly’s most recent earnings report.

I kind of agree with that part. A very similar situation is happening with some of the companies with the largest market cap. Amazon has been pretty much sitting at 3200-3500 since September. I also don't think the whole market is a bubble, but I highly doubt we will see similar returns as what we saw from the FAANGS or MSFT over the next few years.

Taking all that into consideration, looking at all the financials, decide if you think it is under valued and over valued, looking at trends, revenue, income, debt, assets, and the current pe and fe ratios.  


&#x200B;

this does mean i am blind to some sectors of the market, and thats ok i dont need to be fully diversified in everything. If you want to be diversified in a sector of the economy that you dont feel comfortable investing in, I suggest investing in an ETF that covers that area."
2021-05-09 13:12:41,stocks,"> The part I find extremely difficult (and I understand that I am not alone and that this is a multi-trillion dollar question) is to identify what is the ""fair"" value of a company?

The past year has taught me there is no one answer. You're asking a fundamental question about consumer psychology. Why is TSLA valued at 600x PE ratio while GM and F are at 10 and 11 respectively?

Fair value is very subjective and you'll find detractors and zealots on both sides of the argument.

I primarily look at projected future revenue and industry comparative P/S multipliers. This is myopic though as there are lots of other factors that matter including debt levels, P/B ratio, etc. I'm aware of this, but since I have a day job, I can't spend all my extra time doing complicated FA for every company I want to invest.

> I am also a firm believer that you can overpay for a wonderful company. Case in point: If you would have bought MSFT at the height of the dotcom bubble, it would have taken you over 15 years to get back on green!! 

What you're talking about is not ""fair value"" but market sentiment. I think you'll never be able to reconcile the two. For every stock you buy thats further way from rational P/S, P/E, P/B and DCF levels, the higher risk you're taking that your investment will get blown out. But those companies are also the ones that return the highest returns if you got in early.

The short answer: You can't.

The most important answer: Invest in companies you're 100% committed and convicted. Only invest in companies that you'll defend to your dying breath. That people get annoyed when you bring them up because you talk about them so much. Anything else will create doubt and give you paper hands when the stock turns the other way.

Nothing in the stock market is guaranteed. The largest most stable companies may even shake out and collapse, so investing in ETFs is really the only winning strategy over a 20 year time horizon."
2021-05-09 15:36:14,stocks,">I have tried to create my own DCF models and understand all the variables that go in to evaluating a company, but I have very quickly realized that I am way way out of my depth.

Please see this site I created for this specifically so you don't need to create your own complex models: [https://tracktak.com/](https://tracktak.com/)

It's based on Aswath Damodaran's models."

2021-05-09 15:32:37,stocks,"I used to think that fundamentals played a role, but the stock market is ruled by projected future vale, not a companies current value.  If you feel unqualified to make these sorts of determinations get yourself a nice set of ETF's and a nice bond fund.  You will do extremely well over the long term.  In fact as a retail investor that is what I suggest you do early on.  

Then take the money you are willing to bet, and buy a company that you like, for whatever reason you like it.  For me it was AMD at 11 dollars a share, because I was always an AMD fanboy, and I almost 10x on that.  From there I bought QCOM really early on.  Last year it was PLUG.  I was just buying companies that I liked.

Fast forward to this year...   Sure I missed out on TSLA, but NIO was going to do great!  Straight to the moon!  Whoops.

Anyhow, when I started to get technical... it turns out I do better when I pick stocks at random for weirdo emotional reasons.

I find that the market is over heating, and I felt that way in January, but I got caught up in the exuberance of everything pumping and thought I was missing out. I bought in at the end of January and got blown up in March.

I spent a lot of time in the last 2 months trying to understand valuations and I found that I don't know shit. And I also found anyone else who claims to know doesn't know shit either.

I honestly believe there is only one way to find good valuation: have insider knowledge.

If you know about future products, legislation, regulations, then you can bet on a company before that information leaks and affects the stock price. I know thats a pessimistic view of the market, but honestly the more I learn the less I feel like metrics actually mean anything.

Also, metrics don't take into account disruption. And disruption is incredibly subjective."

2021-05-09 13:05:58,stocks,"Just be aware that maximum growth also means maximum loss. If you're investing in a high growth company, you're betting heavily on future revenue and trying to pull forward the future value of a company to today.

I like to personally look at how fast revenue is growing QoQ and YoY. If revenue is growing at 50%+ YoY, companies can start seeing nose bleed valuations as investors will buy the stock today with the expectation that it will grow into its valuation in the future.

The other factor that matters a lot is P/S. When looking at revenue, if every stock was just mapped 1:1 to its current revenue, it would be an uninteresting game. P/S multiplier allow for different industries to have different mkt cap valuations despite pulling in the same revenue.


Overall, when you invest in growth companies, things can start getting out of your normal comfort zone as you'll have to justify why a company deserves to have traditional metrics that fall outside the mean.  For example: P/S multiples, willing to forgive debt ratio, focusing on subscribers/customers without focusing on profits, etc.

Also a huge factor is market sentiment. A company growing revenues 50% YoY in an uninteresting market may never see the stock price growth it deserves. Human psychology and the investing ""mob"" can move against you even if you picked a winner.


If you're looking for maximum growth, you need to first identify what markets will see the largest inflow of customers and revenue. Through 2020, the biggest growth industries were green energy, cloud stocks and EVs. All three had tailwinds of COVID WFH, huge revenue growth and speculation of political policies. But most of that hype has died down in the past 3 months.

Another high growth industry right now is genetics and bioengineering. Its a market in its infancy, and with that comes lots of risks of regulation, consumer acceptance and marketization. Investing in companies like EDIT, CRSP, ILMN, NVTA, etc could yield huge returns in the next 10 years if those things go in your favour.

In the next 12 months, the biggest growth may be in housing, construction and industrials. We're seeing price inflation in raw inputs and a rotation into manufacturing due to COVID reduction. Investing in more speculative businesses in this market (ie. 3D printing, commodities, etc) may yield good returns. Maybe look at the holdings in NAIL and identify which ones have the highest revenue growth potential.

Cybersecurity is also very hot right now. Investors may be willing to accept very high P/S multiples to buy cybersecurity firms because of the secular tailwinds with the transition of nation state proxy wars moving from the battlefield to cyberspace. Companies like FEYE, CRWD, ZS, NET, QLYS may work for your favour."
2021-05-09 13:26:43,stocks,"Be careful right now as money is flowing out of high growth no profit or even companies that are losing money at the moment.  Alot of them had already ran up huge over the past year.  Money seems to be flowing into Boomer plays like oil, materials.  But if your planning on years long holds then it should be ok.  Chances are it's gonna go up unless the company goes tits up."

In 2018, TSLA was making 10k cars A YEAR. They were 6 months from bankruptcy. People were saying how TSLA was doomed to fail. Now look at TSLA. They're making 18k cars A MONTH. They're the highest valued car maker in the world. They've been included into the S&P500. In 2018, TSLA lost 50% of its value from Feb 2019 to June 2019.

I also would be wary of any get-rich-quick strategies that you might feel obligated to play in order to see the returns you desire in a short period of time.

If you haven’t already, I would familiarize yourself with the community college system in your area and how to apply for financial aid. I would identify schools you’re interested in attending or eventually transferring to and viewing their overall cost of attendance and how it’s broken down. Lastly, I would try to gauge about how many hours/week you’re willing to work in order to add a cushion and potentially borrow less than the maximum allowed in student loans. Stick to state schools if you can, which are generally cheaper. The caveat would be if you’re interested in a particular program that you think will help your career."

Easy peasy? 

1. Dollar cost averaging - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp
2. Low cost index or sector funds
3. Setup direct deposit from your employer and steadily increase the amount to 20% of your gross. Eg +1% each year until you hit the target. (Using money from your checking account is hard, when it never goes there we automatically adjust our spending habits to compensate)

4. Take advantage of any “matching” from your employer for a 401(k) or similar option - free monies and an instant +100% return!

It’s not glamorous but it will take you places. 

Remember that there is not a single 10 year period from the start of the stock market to the present that wasn’t in the green. When the market goes down - buy more. When the market goes up - buy less (see \#1 link above)"

That's a nice supplement to any 401k plan you get when you start a career. Work this plan in a Roth IRA and that money will be tax advantaged. In 39 years for a Roth (withdrawal age 59.5), this will be worth around 1.06 million.

2021-05-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Stocks to hold forever? Hi I’m turning 19 soon and I have invested 90% of my savings since last year to have a combined net worth of little more than 13k. I currently live abroad but I expect to go back  in less than a year. I use a foreign brokerage that charges me for all the transaction and exchange rate, which is quite high. So I refrain from trading as much as possible, meaning I have to hold shares for a long time to make a sizable gain. In practice, a 2-2.5% gain would break even due to currency exchange fees and taxes mostly.

My main question is if these stocks are good enough to hold for at least 5 years. Idk if I’ll change my brokerage once I go back to the states or not, but if I decide to continue to use it I don’t have to sell anything. I currently hold the following:

- AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, PYPL, TSLA, HD, LOW, WMT, KO, VIG, JNJ, PG, ABT, COST, SBUX, TGT, ICLN

When choosing stocks I didn’t really look through the financial sheets. I simply bought companies that looked relatively stable and well known anywhere I go. Let me know what you think!"

If you withdraw after 59.5 years old you will not pay ANY taxes on your gains. YOU CAN DO MORE WITH THE TIME YOU HAVE THAN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU PUT IN. 
At 19 if you max this out every year, It will dwarf every other retirement account you will have. I am literally averaging 11% on my target retirement fund. And have been for the past 6 years. Capital gains tax is a huge factor for long term gains, but this is removed when you own a Roth. This is the way."

But I think that your stock choices are excellent and you should hold them indefinitely as well (monitoring of course). They are all very well established, popular, successful companies. TSLA worries me a little but it all depends when you bought in.

In fact I own a lot of the ones you picked for years now and have grown a $1.5M taxable account of exactly these kinds of dividend paying and large growth stocks... in *addition* to significant index fund balances. Do both."

2021-05-09 12:14:59,stocks,"Not a terrible idea, but some things to consider:
1. Dividend stocks take a bigger beating than non-dividend ones if/when there is an inflation related sell off. Because dividends are worth less. 
2. Dividend stocks don’t tend to grow as much as certain non-dividend growth plays. Look at AT&T’s chart. Steady, but very slow growth. 

My point being, dividend stocks are not for everyone. 

Typically older/retired folks tend to lean more on dividends for income and because they are usually offered by more mature companies, they tend to be less risky. Works in their favor. 

If age/time is on your side, you could take higher risks for higher rewards, so you are probably better off rolling with high growth (and no dividend), because more often than not, growth stocks trump value/dividend stocks. 

There is no such thing as low risk, high reward in the stock market."

I actually like stocks like this in an overheated market because there is so much less speculation built into the price, so when the market comes down it shouldn't drop nearly as much. Plus, there is a national security aspect built into AT&T as well, so the government won't let them go under."

Sure, I wouldn't recommend an 18 year old to load up on bonds, but there are stocks like NIO that are not good investments because they have substantial downside due to being overvalued. 

No-Status4032 gave good advice. Look into broad-market index funds for the time being while learnings fundamentals and how to assess and evaluate a company's fair value. For example, you can learn how to value a company based on DCF (discounted cash flow). You then apply a margin of safety based on your risk tolerance.

Huge upside of investing in ETFs:

1. You don't need to invest valueable time into your portfolio

2. You don't get emotional about it, because it's boring af

3. It rebalances on its own

1. People in general don't understand the power of compounding interest.

I agree with this advice - find a nice basket of stocks to invest in - but of your original list PayPal is the only one that gives me pause. A lot  more competition than they used to have, regulatory pressure and the partnership with eBay seems to be getting eroded. They may have some secret sauce that they’re ready to bust out, but it’s the only one I wouldn’t “set and forget”. Other than that - check your diversity. Are you heavy into one particular sector?

Plug is a lottery play, either they come out with a hydrogen fuel cell that competes with electric, and their stock flys, or they do nothing, and stagnate/fall in the coming years. APD allows you to play on any move to hydrogen, whether that be car transport, air transport, maritime, etc. 

What's often overlooked is that petroleum refinery accounts for a considerable revenue share right now thanks to government regulations encouraging desulphurisation of fuels. Essentially, you don't even have to bet on the future hydrogen market, when the market is already there, no matter whether we see a move to ev soon or not. Rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries also drive the hydrogen generation market. I've always been a fan of the prospects of hydrogen, but a lot of people think that the only use for hydrogen is travel, but evidently, that's far from the case"

For example, the perfect play would have been selling at 300K and buying at 200K instead of being long always (you would have earned more). But obviously, this is just my opinion.

The sp 500 had an average gain of 10 percent between 1986 and 2016.  In 1 year, a 1000 dollar investment could be worth 1100 in an average year - that doesn't  feel like much to people who look at graphs of 'winner' stocks that have moved a lot in a short amount of time.

But that 1000 dollars, over the course of 35 years, becomes over $28,000 if you never added another dollar.

Now, let's say you add just 50 dollars per month on top of your initial $1000, and the average rate of return is 10 percent still.  Over the course of 35 years you will deposit $21000 and by the end it will be worth $198,000.

# **Inflation is the big challenge for markets and the Fed in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/inflation-is-the-big-challenge-for-markets-and-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> After April’s disappointing jobs report, market focus will shift squarely to inflation in the week ahead.
*****
> The tug-of-war over tech stocks will also continue to be a dominant force in the stock market, after Friday’s bounce more than halved the week’s losses in the S&P technology sector.
*****
> The April employment report was extremely disappointing with just 266,000 jobs created, well below the 1 million expected. The Friday report cast doubt on the expectations of some investors that the Fed will move toward paring back its so-called quantitative easing bond purchases later this year.
*****
> The thinking is if the inflation data appears hot when the consumer price index is reported Wednesday, it could ignite the debate about whether the Fed will have to tighten policy sooner than it would like. For now, the market is viewing the April jobs data as a distorted one-off report.
*****
> “It’s all about the inflation numbers. It’s all about the transitory nature and to what extent we’ll see it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group “It’s more relevant to the CPI month-over-month changes. If the month-over-month gains are starting to pick up steam, and we’re seeing 0.3% to 0.4%, that’s not transitory and that’s a problem for the Fed.”
*****
> Economists expect April CPI to rise 0.2% over March, after a gain of 0.6% the month earlier. But on a year-over-year basis, CPI is expected to look sizzling, jumping 3.6%, according to Dow Jones. That compares to 2.6% the month earlier. Excluding food and fuel, CPI is expected to rise by 0.3% on a month-over-month basis.
*****
> The central bank has maintained that the pop in inflation is expected to be transitory.
*****
> Multiple Fed speakers are on the calendar, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who speaks a half-hour after the CPI print Wednesday. Other officials speaking include Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard, New York President John Williams and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan.
*****
> The producer price index is reported Thursday, and that should confirm a trend of higher prices that is showing up in corporate earnings releases. Another important data point, retail sales is released Friday.
*****
> Boockvar said the retail sales report is not as important since it has been artificially boosted by one-time stimulus checks.
*****
> “It’s like the steroid era of baseball,” he said. “Who knows how many home runs it would have hit without stimulus.”
*****
> # Tech battleground
> The S&P 500 and Dow finished the past week with gains. The S&P rose 1.2% to 4,232, and 2.7% to 34,777. But the technology-laden Nasdaq fell about 1.5% to 13,752, even with Friday’s 0.9% gain.
*****
> In the commodities market, fears of inflation continued to build.
*****
> Copper futures hit a record high, as did lumber futures, rising 13% in the past week. Corn futures rose 8.6% in the past week, finishing at the highest level since 2013.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 2% to $64.90 per barrel.
*****
> The 10-year note yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55%, down from 1.63% a week ago.
*****
> Commodities fueled gains in the stock market this week, with the S&P energy sector by far the best performer, up 8.9%. Materials rose 5.9%, followed by financials, which were up 4.2%. Industrials gained 3.4%. But the S&P technology sector slumped 0.5%, for the week even with a 0.8% gain Friday.
*****
> “I think one thing that people are overlooking is that the technology selling we’ve seen in the last few days...is not just the reaction to the adverse earnings price reactions that we saw from certain tech names,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.
*****
> “But it’s also this idea in that in a world where we assume capital gains taxes could go up, that’s where the capital gains lie,” he added. “So they are likely to come under incrementally more pressure on that basis.”
*****
> President Joe Biden has proposed raising capital gains taxes to 39.6% for taxpayers making more than $1 million. That’s up from the current top rate of 20%.
*****
> Emanuel said the upcoming federal income tax return filing date of May 17 could also be adding pressure to technology, since investors may be selling winners to pay their taxes.
*****
> “With the tax bill coming due on May 17 for the 2020 calendar year, people are just going to use it as an excuse within the context of higher capital gains taxes to sell those stocks to pay for their tax bill,” Emanuel said. “I think people are overlooking this as part of the reason.”
*****
> Boockvar said tech names could also face further headwinds from higher interest rates, particularly if inflation data is hotter than expected.
*****
> “I think the last couple of weeks tells you froth is coming out of the most expensive part of tech and earnings for the big cap names are as good as it gets in terms of growth rates. The market is telling you that,” he said. “If you get a further move in rates, that’s a headwind.”
*****
> Earnings season continues in the week ahead though most of the rush is over for the quarter. Disney, Marriott, Wynn Resorts, Airbnb are among the companies reporting that should provide insight on the economic reopening.

> # ARKK Stocks Breakdowns and Bounces

> After struggling for most of the past couple months, momentum and Tech stocks are broadly outperforming today as the Nasdaq is up 1.25% compared to a 0.78% gain in the S&P 500. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has been a poster child of the momentum theme over the past year. After a 383.9% gain from the March 2020 low to its high in mid-February, ARKK has fallen around 30% in the months since then. For most of that time, the ETF consolidated between its 50 and 200-DMA. After a failed attempt to break above its 50-DMA at the end of April, it has taken a leg lower, falling below its 200-DMA for the first time in a year in the process. While ARKK has yet to move back above its 200-DMA, it has found support around $105 which traces back to the lows earlier this spring and the highs from the fall. In other words, from a technical perspective ARKK, as well as some of its holdings, still have plenty of technical hurdles including moving back above its moving averages and breaking the past few months' downtrends. At least for the time being, the group has found some respite in the move higher today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK.png))**

> As for the individual holdings of the ARKK ETF, below we show the 25 largest which accounts for approximately three-quarters of net asset value. For the most part, these stocks continue to sit on huge gains from the past year (or since their market debut for those that have IPO'ed in the past year; bolded and bordered rows in the table below) with only a small handful in the red: Teladoc (TDOC), Coinbase (COIN), and Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA). Even though the 25 largest ARKK holdings are on average up 117% over the past year, they have certainly been a pain trade recently. Most of these names are deeply oversold at the moment, and relative to their 52-week highs, they are down 35% on average. In fact, of all 58 holdings, there are only four—Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), TuSimple (TSP), Trimble (TRMB), and PACCAR (PCAR)—that are less than 10% below their 52-week highs, and none of these break into the top 25 largest holdings (as such they are not pictured below).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Table.png))**

> While ARKK holdings have generally been weak over the past few months, in recent days there have been some notable developments in the charts of these names. Some of these like CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) and EXACT Sciences (EXAS) have fallen below the long-term 200-DMA. Other names in the ETF broke below their 200-DMA a while ago now, and their charts do not look much better. Stocks like Invitae (NVTA), Materialise (MTLS), and Teladoc (TDOC) collapsed below their long-term moving averages earlier this spring and this week's moves lower have resulted in breaks of critical support levels. For TDOC and MTLS, those levels have previously marked support at multiple points in the past year. One other interesting name in terms of performance today is Regeneron (REGN). Unlike many other ARKK stocks, REGN has actually been trending higher since March, albeit that is in the context of a much longer-term downtrend than many other ARKK holdings. Regardless, that recent rally has resulted in the stock to run right up to its long-term downtrend. In another move that is out of sync with its peers, today it has reversed lower, failing to break out from that downtrend.

> While most names have pulled back sharply and continue to trend lower to sideways at best, that is not to say all ARKK stocks have entirely negative charts. Similar to the ETF's chart, there are several names that have found support in the past couple of days. For example, DocuSign (DOCU), Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA), Palantir (PLTR), and Spotify (SPOT) are all bouncing off critical support levels of the past year. For others like Fate Therapeutics (FATE), Iridium (IRDM), PagerDuty (PD), PACCAR (PCAR), and Synopsis (SNPS), those support levels have also coincided with their moving averages. PACCAR is also notable in that it is even breaking back above its 50-DMA today. Similarly, Novartis (NVS) is attempting to move back above its 200-DMA. Perhaps one of the most technically strong stocks of these has been Sea Ltd (SEE). Over the past year, the 50-DMA has consistently provided reliable support. After a brief dip back below in March, in April it moved back above its 50-DMA and has once again successfully retested in the past week.

> # Commodities Soar to Five Year Highs

> As talk of inflation continues to heat up, one asset class fueling the fire has been the commodities complex. In our one-year review of the market low, we noted how commodities had been some of the biggest winners during the market recovery. Well that trend hasn’t stopped yet, and as shown in the chart below, on Wednesday, the Bloomberg Commodity Index closed at its highest level since August 2015.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Blog-5.7.21-a.png?ssl=1))**

> Whether this strength flows through to CPI or Core PCE (the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation) remains to be seen, but the technicals suggest this move could just be getting started. WTI crude oil is on the verge of breaking above a level of technical resistance that capped prices in 2019, while copper prices are less than 3% from their 2011 all-time highs. However, those who thought gold would benefit from inflation fears have been mistaken. In fact, of the 23 commodities tracked in the Bloomberg Commodity Index, gold is the worst performing year to date and one of the few that is actually negative over that time period.

> To be clear, we are not calling for runaway inflation. In fact, breaking to five year highs shows that broadly commodities have gone nowhere over that time period. However, we do continue to have a bullish view of energy and industrial metals and wouldn’t be surprised to see this trend continue, albeit likely at a slower pace than the past year. If prices do continue to rise it may put more pressure on companies who are not able to pass those costs onto consumers. But if companies are broadly able to pass these increased input costs along, then expect price increases to begin showing up in traditional inflation measures, but any persistent impact is likely to be modest. Be sure to check out the LPL Research blog next Wednesday, as we examine the April CPI data release.

> # April Jobs Data Disappoints Lofty Expectations

> Investors betting on a continued acceleration in U.S. payrolls in April following March’s impressive numbers received an unwelcome reminder of just how choppy the data can be month-to-month.

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added only 266,000 jobs in April, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 1,000,000. The prior two months also received net negative revisions of 78,000 jobs. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.1% from 6%, though that was paired with an above-estimate gain in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.5% to 61.7%, equaling a recovery high. Average hourly earnings rose 0.7% month over month, signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected.

> Anecdotal commentary provided by companies in recent months detailing their difficulty finding qualified job candidates evidently worked its way into the data this month in a big way. There are a few explanations for why this might be. Enhanced unemployment benefits may reduce the urgency for some to return to work. Additionally, still-closed schools and lack of child-care may make it difficult for workers to return to the in-person segments of the labor markets. And finally, March’s big jump in payrolls may have represented a rehiring of workers with whom hiring managers already had relationships, such as furloughed employees. Hiring new workers requires a more rigorous, and time-consuming, vetting process.

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, April bucked the reacceleration trend seen off the December 2020 low. Total payrolls still sit about 8.2 million below the February 2020 peak of 152.5 million, but we are still very optimistic about our ability to recapture the lion’s share of those losses quickly despite today’s disappointing readout.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.7.21-Blog-CHart.png?ssl=1))**

> “The job market got a bit of a reality check this morning,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we always caution against reading too far into one data release, we think most of the cited factors that suppressed April’s payroll number should wear off naturally with time. We believe that despite April’s speedbump the overall trend will be higher from here.”

> Given the magnitude of the total loss that still needs to be recovered and the varying degrees to which parts of our economy are currently open, we believe jobs data will carry the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Improving employment trends—though choppy—buoy consumer strength, and the economy overall, given consumers’ large weighting in the calculation of gross domestic product (GDP). As such, we continue to recommend positioning portfolios to take advantage of these trends, where appropriate, including an overweight allocation to equities relative to benchmarks, and a tilt toward sectors that may benefit more from a continued cyclical upturn

> # Let’s Talk About Stocks And Higher Taxes

> Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

> First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Cinco de Mayo!

> One of the big discussions lately has been about how will higher taxes potentially impact the stock market. We’ve known since President Biden won the presidency and the Democrats secured control of the House and Senate that higher taxes were coming, likely in the form of higher corporate taxes and higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy—though probably not until 2022. It is worth noting though that stocks haven’t been fazed at all by all the higher taxes talk, as we just saw the best first 100 days for stocks under a new president since FDR.

> With proposals for the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan (AFP) and $2 trillion plus infrastructure bill (known as the American Jobs Plan or AJP), higher taxes are needed to help finance the new spending. Let’s be clear though, with a 50/50 Senate (Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties) and historically slim Democratic majority in the House, we think these final numbers will likely come in less than $3 trillion combined, as these initial numbers from the Democrats are starting points for negotiations.

> Higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy are one way to pay for things, with the AFP proposing to increase the top tax rate on ordinary income to 39.6% from 37%, and capital gains and dividends taxes on those who earn more than $1 million to a maximum of 43.4% from the current 23.8%. Fun stat, only 0.32% of the population makes more than $1 million a year, so the truth is this won’t impact the other 99.68% of the population.

> “We’ve known higher taxes were coming so this shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone at this point,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Now here’s the catch, looking back at the times that taxes increased amid a strong economy, stocks did just fine. Given the strong economic outlook this year, you’d have to think history could repeat once again.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, in 1986 and 2013, capital gains taxes increased, but the economy was on firm footing back then, compared with the 1970s hikes, which saw an economy marred by higher inflation and sluggish growth. Not surprisingly, the two more recent hikes saw solid stock market performance, while the 1970s hikes didn’t. Is it as simple as how the economy is doing? It very well could be.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Corporate taxes are currently 21% and President Biden has discussed increasing the level to 28%. Although we think in the end the level will be more like 25%, the bottom line is higher corporate taxes are likely coming, which could knock a few percentage points off of future S&P 500 Index earnings growth.

> So what happens after corporate taxes are raised? As the table below shows, muted returns a year out are normal, but interestingly stocks have consistently been in the green the three months before the official date of the tax increase, suggesting investors weren’t very worried about higher taxes on the horizon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> It’s always possible that higher taxes slowly take a bite out stock market returns over a longer time period than just a year, but if the concern is what all the talk about higher taxes may mean for markets over the next year, there’s not much historical evidence pointing to the potential for a bad outcome. The picture is murkier, though, with corporate taxes, which isn’t surprising, since stock prices are ultimately tied to earnings growth. But is often happens, markets seem to be more attuned to larger economic forces.

> # Individuals, Writers, and Managers All Still Bullish

> The major indices are broadly lower in the past week with the exception of the Dow which has risen just over 1%. The Nasdaq on the other hand has been the worst performer falling almost 3%. Even though the major indices are split in terms of performance, sentiment has gone the way of the Dow as bullish sentiment as measured through the AAII weekly survey rose 1.7 percentage points to 44.3%. While not a particularly large increase, this week did mark the first time bullish sentiment has risen in a month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull.png))**

> With bullish sentiment higher, fewer respondents reported as bearish. Only 23.1% of investors reported pessimistic sentiment; down 2.6 percentage points versus last week's reading. Just like bullish sentiment, that was not a particularly large change, and it leaves the reading in the middle of the past several weeks' range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bear.png))**

> The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread climbing 4.3 points to 21.2. While that is still at the high end of the past few years' range, it is 11 points below where it stood only two weeks ago. Looking at another sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence which targets equity newsletter writers, the bull-bear spread also rose slightly week over week leaving the spread well below levels from only a couple of weeks ago. In other words, sentiment has moderated recently, but it has not dramatically shaken a historically bullish tone.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

> Perhaps the most notable reading in this week's AAII survey was the reading on neutral sentiment. Up 0.7 percentage points from the prior week, it was not a particularly large gain especially compared to the 5 and 5.2 percentage point gains the previous two weeks. Regardless, moving higher once again neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the first week of March. Other than that week and the current one, there has only been one other week in the past year (second to last week of 2020) in which neutral sentiment was as high as it is now. Even though this week's reading is elevated relative to the past year, compared to the rest of the history of the survey, it is pretty unremarkable. On average over the life of the survey, neutral sentiment has averaged a reading just 0.9 percentage points lower than this week's reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> The NAAIM Exposure Index is yet one more sentiment reading that also has shown some moderation but remains at a generally bullish level. This index reflects the average exposure to US equities of members of the National Association of Active Investment Managers. Readings of 200 would indicate they are leveraged long on average, 100 would be fully invested, 0 would be market neutral, -100 would be fully short, and -200 would be leveraged short. Last week saw this index tip above 100 for the first time since mid-February which also ranked in the top 2% of all readings going back to 2006. This week it fell 15.93 points. That stands in the bottom decile of weekly moves and was the largest drop since late March, but at 87.79, the index still points to historically bullish positioning among active managers.

2021-05-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Any opinions on Uber Technologies (UBER) and DoorDash (DASH)? Don’t know about the rest of people, but I believe both may be undervalued _IF they have profitability prospects._

I enjoy the ideas that Uber and DoorDash have brought to the table, and I feel like there will always be a constant need for them (individualised urban transportation and food transportation).

I really wasn’t a big fan of Uber selling off their autonomous vehicles division, I feel like that was a good chance of profitability for them.

I like the companies, but don’t like the fact that they’re not profitable. Either way, I thought I would reach out to see other people’s opinions about these companies. Have you invested or avoided and why?"
2021-05-09 09:22:59,stocks,Avoided due to legal conditions for gig workers. Too many uncertainties.
2021-05-09 12:44:26,stocks,"Uber will never be profitable, barring a dramatic overhaul in their business model. Same with door dash. The gig economy just doesn't lend itself to making money for these companies. Perhaps when autonomous becomes global, but since neither business owns the R&D to these, they'll still have to contract that out.

Uber in particular loses billions, with a B, and has no realistic path to profit. The only way taxi companies were able to survive was through government-backed monopolies. Now the market is hyper diluted, and we're supposed to believe they can be successful?

Doordash is in a similar boat. The little money they make comes through bullying and exploiting the restaurants they work with, to take some of the margins, and even that is no where near close to covering expenses.

I consider both of these businesses to be extremely overvalued, even assuming they were successful, which they are not. Way out on both of these companies."

2021-05-09 12:48:45,stocks,"Not good investments if you ask me. Domino's hires and retains their own delivery drivers because it's more profitable. Any restaurant that is doing a significant amount of business via delivery would be wise to follow suit and cut out the middle man. There are companies like Square offering software so that restaurants can manage orders themselves, which will save them money compared to paying a 3rd-party a cut. They may grow in the short term, but I don't think they have a good long term business model. These companies are only profitable if their workers continue to work for ridiculously low wages, which I don't believe is sustainable."
2021-05-09 14:45:07,stocks,UBER and other ride share businesses will probably suffer under proposed regulations.  Basically any of these companies that treat their employees like contractors are toast.

2021-05-09 12:36:31,stocks,"Uber loses around $2-3B a year.  They have no model where they make a profit.  They will take on more debt and issue more stock, further diluting each share.  Bankruptcy will eventually hit them.  They will ""reorganize"" and shed some debt.  Can they recover if no one will loan them money?"
2021-05-09 12:45:13,stocks,"I look at it this way, is Uber going anywhere? The short and long answer are both no. Their install base is astronomical and they are expanding quickly. Profitability is irrelevant at this stage for them, but I would consider it a near certainty over the next decade.

With that being said, they have not made profit and burn cash. With Uber you’re betting whether they will become profitable sooner rather than later, not if they are going to exist. This is a relatively safe bet and if you look at it from the other angle, their lack of profitability is depressing their share value currently. This is a solveable issue that they are tackling. Their competitors are facing existential problems, will they survive? Nobody thinks Uber will die, and neither should you or I.

Edit: Also they are going to garner a lot of business over the next two years."

2021-05-09 16:17:45,stocks,"As a gig worker, yup, there is no long term profit growth from broad adoption. It's a specialized service for the mildly wealthy. If you can't tip AT MIN $5, you are fucking your desperate, underpaid driver. DRIVING, in any form, is the most dangerous profession, more cops die from traffic than crooks. 

From the executive class perspective, it's great though because all costs are pushed to local governments and federal tax credits. Tires pop and windshields break, nobody is being honest with their insurance company, people drive with their kids in the back. The ""self-employed"" people eat it, not the board.

2021-05-09 11:38:27,stocks,Same
2021-05-09 13:30:25,stocks,"Yes, because the 12 year old company will finally turn it around, despite having no significant new profitable markets to expand into, and continuing to face price wars with Lyft, taxis, and similar local competition. They will suddenly figure out how to not lose $2B/year, as they continue to face increased legal pressure to add more expenses in way of driver wages and benefits.

When autonomous becomes viable, we can revisit the discussion, but we're still several years before this is given mainstream credibility. Tesla and similar companies actually working on it are still in rough draft mode, but until you're not required to have an actual person in the car that you have to pay, it's a losing proposition."
2021-05-09 15:59:00,stocks,"When the first company solves fully autonomous driving, Uber will suddenly need to compete with prices that are 1/3rd lower than theirs or invest billions of dollars in a gigantic fleet and pay hundreds of dollars in software subscription costs per car each month. It will destroy their business model."
2021-05-09 13:34:54,stocks,"Hey there, thanks for your comment and reply :)

You have made a very good case here. I feel like the CEO, however, does know what he is doing with the company. He used to be the CEO of Expedia and really grew that company up well before he left. Expedia also has **plenty** of competitors, but they managed to make it through.

I think there’s more paths that Uber could take to profitability, I find a lot of trust in the CEO for now though.

Do you think that Uber truly stands no chance at all of becoming profitable, and you think that the company doesn’t have a viable long-term business model full stop?"
2021-05-09 16:37:38,stocks,"Uber sold off that part of their business though and gave it to another company that will end up putting the service on Uber’s platform.

Sure, Uber will probably get a cut of it, but will it be enough to get them out of all of this?"
2021-05-09 13:55:14,stocks,"Yeah, don't take everything I say as the ultimate truth. Like I tried to convey, I do think there's a market for this sort of business once autonomous becomes a thing. The issue is, what happens if Tesla is the one who cracks it, and decides to enter that market themselves? And, shockingly, I've been wrong on a stock once or twice before.

This is of course just my opinion based on their current financials, and my personal projections going forward. I hate saying they have absolutely no chance at all. But given the ultra competitive nature of these gig based business models, and the uncertainty regarding legal rulings, I feel these companies are walking on a tightrope, with very little room for error. So long as they continue to hemorrhage money, they don't look appealing. I lump Uber, doordash, air bnb, etc in this category.

There's certainly a ""chance"" they pull it together, but with over 3000 companies on the NYSE, why would I take the risk on this one?"
2021-05-09 14:32:25,stocks,"It’s not just Uber, it’s all of those kinda companies. The current business model simply doesn’t work, so you’re betting on something fundamentally changing. I think theres better bets to make"

Price is falling because of     
Q1 loss,   
Increase debt,     
Bad future for air travel in EU because of vaccination,

Edit: A couple more things - just because a short has a high short interest doesn’t mean it’s getting “forced” down. They also had terrible earnings last week so that could be a major reason they’re down over the last week, but they’re actually up on 5/7 since earnings on 5/6 so I’m not sure what time period you’re looking at (down over last few months too obviously). There have been other headwinds (China canceling their Shanghai route for example) - the company NEEDS a good summer in order to generate enough cash to patch their balance sheet and vaccine rollout in EU is crap. They’re looking to do an equity raise at some point too 

FWIW looks like P72 increased their short position in the stock (updated Friday) by about 1.3% of the companies stock. Disclosed shorts look to be like 4.5% of float. Helikon has a 2.5% short position.

*As part of  its recapitalization plan announced at the launch of the capital  increase announced on April 12, 2021, and completed on April 19, 2021  for an amount of €1.036 billion, the Company has issued on April 20,  2021 undated deeply subordinated notes (recorded as IFRS equity in the  Company's consolidated financial statements) for a total amount of €3  billion, subscribed in full by the French State by way of set-off on  claims it holds on the Company pursuant to the shareholders’ loan (the “****ACC****”) granted in May 2020 and fully drawn for the amount of €3 billion (the “****Deeply Subordinated Notes****”).*

*This  issue will be composed of three tranches with a perpetual maturity and a  nominal amount of €1 billion each, with respective first redemption  options (Call) at 4, 5 and 6 years and then redeemable on each interest  payment date, and bearing interest at 7.00%, 7.25% and 7.50%  respectively until these dates.* 

*These initial  interest rates for each tranche will increase to 8.50%, 8.00% and 8.00%,  respectively, on the first respective early redemption date at the  option of the Company, of the relevant tranche. These interest rates  will then be reset every year from April 20, 2028, on the basis of the  12-month Euribor rate plus a margin of 10.40%, it being specified that  the applicable 12-month Euribor rate will not be lower than -0.45%.*

2021-05-09 08:12:56,stocks,"There's many factors, most of them coming from the company itself (it's basically on life support right now thanks to the French government).

I was mostly thinking if I should weather the storm, or just nope the f\*ck out before I lose most of it. I started thinking about the Shorted Capital, cause a BUNCH of analysts came out at once telling people to sell. It's one thing if they say it'll go down to €3,00... but €0,40?

I feel like, if we see a spike in short selling, on top of its current financial situation, we might as well just scram. But if we don't, I don't mind waiting: Restrictions will begin to lift on May 19th, here.

2021-05-09 10:07:54,stocks,"Agreed, but one way or another state intervention is free money (even if payed back with low interest or when scoring would inhibit lending on the free market) - might not pay of shortterm. 

I am not bullish on aero however - too much changed - people gotten comfortable with staying home (shortterm spike to ""get out again"" will come again), businesses being comfortable with lots of remote work and less in situ/person business... 

These changes at scale will change the business - I believe - higher cost of operation due to lower scale, scaleback of airports. 

So while I believe they will rebound and will even spike short time business, it will flatten off lower than pre covid.

They actually have revenue and they have customers like DHL and Amazon with vehicles on the road, yet their share price dropped below $10 before the merger even happened. Just because everyone is selling out of spacs

The big auto will get a market share of the EVs but their tech towards autonomy is far behind that of Tesla. Tesla is essentially a software developer as much as they are a young car manufacturer. It is literally going to become the iPhone of cars as they’re able to produce them. There’s plenty of room for these other pre rev companies to get a piece of the pie too without even worrying about what the large auto manufacturers are doing. They’re all far behind Tesla and don’t have any revolutionary technology to compensate for it so they’ll need some help. /rant"

Chinese antitrust regulators tightening competition laws against Alibaba. The company has been fined like 18B RMB but the investigation still doesn't seem to be over yet. Chinese regulators now scrutinize group discounts and other forms of sale incentives which they deem to be anticompetitive.

E-commerce delivery relies strongly on SF Express more than their own subsidiary Cainiao. Alibaba is investing strongly in building their own logistics center so they are burning cash but the Cainiao delivery service is decisively worse than SF Express. Unlike USA where Amazon can still use UPS for delivery despite dumping FedEx in China SF Express is much more powerful and Alibaba is exposed to greater cost if there is a fee dispute between Alibaba and SF Express."
2021-05-09 09:25:35,stocks,"All the reasons listed here are around CCP, VIE structure, and where-did-Jack-Ma-go. These are not at the top of my worries with BABA.

The best argument against investing in BABA is good old fashioned competition. You have JD, Meituan, and Pinduoduo taking market share away, not to mention other e-commerce startups. Anti-trust means BABA is no longer going to be able to prohibit merchants from selling on competitor platforms. BABA’s market share has been a steady decline over the last four years (granted the overall pie has gotten much larger). Who do you think is in the background pulling the strings? Tencent and Pony Ma, one of the smartest tech investors in the world who owns chunks of all these BABA competitors. Finally, if you don’t live in China and know what is going on the ground you’re making a best guess off of reports of other analysts who also don’t live in China. Things move fast and are much more fluid than the US, I see BABA’s position as less secure than many Western tech companies.

2021-05-09 13:24:06,stocks,"Alibaba Bear Case

The competitive enviornment for Alibaba is fierce. Core business of Alibaba is Chinese Commerce Retail, which are revenues from Tmall and Taobao. Split the Chinese market into high end, mid tier, and lower end. Alibaba faces stiff competition from JD are the high end and Pinduoduo (PDD) at the low end. Pinduoduo also is likely to take over mid-tier are their existing low-tier customers upgrade their consumption. In regards e-commerce the top tier cities are saturated, the lower-tier cities are the future of Chinese consumption (67% of the population).  Taoboa isnt likely to beat PDD at its own game anytime soon. So why does it appear that Alibaba is growing its core commerce so much?? Consumer credit loans via ANT.  ANT shows over 253B consumer loans, about 80% of their credit products. However, regulations will likely curtail ANT's lending ability which will likely impact top-line growth for Taobao and Tmall. Its difficult to determine just how much of these consumer's loans are spent on Alibaba's platforms.

Alibaba has 2 new growth seeds (Cainiao and Cloud) but they are in early form - these are their bright spots for future growth. They also have an insane moat for big data. Alibaba is more of a value investment now with robust financial profile rather then a growth stock."
2021-05-09 06:48:27,stocks,Also I’m wondering if some of you could comment on JD vs BABA.

2021-05-09 09:05:28,stocks,"The VIE structure consists of a foreign holding company, which is normally a company in the Cayman Islands, a wholly owned company in China (wholly foreign company or WFOE) and a Chinese domestic operation company owned exclusively by citizens. Founders, foreign investors and other shareholders hold shares in the Cayman holding, which in turn holds a 100% stake in WFOE. The operating company is a purely Chinese domestic company that is licensed to operate in the restricted industry in China and is controlled by WFOE through a series of contractual agreements between the parties. Although in practice this model is working without any problems, there are some concerns about its application. Chinese law does not directly address the structure of the VIE, however, it is clearly applicable that the court may declare a contract void ""when a legal form is used to conceal an illegal purpose"". Thus, if the court considers a structure as a way of illegally hiding foreign investment in restricted businesses, the contract is no longer valid. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) released a report in 2011 expressing its views on the use of VIE, but has not commented since then on the structure of VIE. Other regulatory agencies in China, including the Ministry of Commerce and the Central Bank, also questioned the viability of the VIE structure in public statements The data shows that more than half of Chinese companies listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ are using the VIE framework, and although many lawyers in China believe that the risk of the Chinese government cracking down on the VIE framework is very low, investors in these companies need to understand that your investment is very sensitive to legal and political changes. Even the companies that have this model of structure emphasize in their documents that there are substantial uncertainties in relation to the interpretation and application of current and current laws on the subject."

  My stock is Kaleyra (KLR). Its an Italian company, a competitor of Twilio but in its infant stage. Its a very undervalued tech play as well: its valuation is only  $380 million, compared to Twilio's massive $52 billion. Why do I pick Kaleyra, instead of Twilio, or any other competitor? It operates as a bridge in the communication process of  App-Cloud-Message-Customer. A simple SMS from your bank app or Uber happens thanks to a company like Kaleyra.  Also provides communications involving chatbots, verification process, voice messages, Whatsapp messages, you name it.   Its a sector that keeps growing more and more and has significant barriers of entry. Here some points: 

\-It has a prices-to-sales ratio of 2, yes, only 2!. 

\-Kaleyra operates mainly in Europe, India, and its gaining ground in the US thanks to a very recent acquisition. It has a lot of know-how in the financial industry.

\-It is cash-flow positive. 

\-It has among its clients Twilio. Yeah, its main competitor has been its client. Plus other 3500 enterprise customers. 

\-It got its debut last year in Wall Street. With the acquisition of Mgage, its projected to double its revenue in a year or less. The stock price has suffered lately, no bad news whatsoever, just affected by the market in general and shorters: 15% of its stocks are shorted. 

\-Twilio is the absolute leader of this sector, with a better growth rate and better margins. However, a company like Kaleyra, with such a small valuation and great growth prospects, offers a potential multi-bagger possibility in a shorter time. Next earning report is next Monday.

2021-05-09 07:26:41,stocks,"Ligand (LGND). They have a massive pipeline of drugs in various stages of approval with dozens and dozens of pharmaceutical companies worldwide, including the big pharma names. Ligand provides the medium by which the drugs are delivered to the body.

They earn milestone payments as drugs progress through the clinical stages, and royalties if they go into production. They also make and sell Captisol (Google it) with good margins. It is a complex business with a lot of moving parts. To date only a small number of potential drugs are currently earning royalties.

They are profitable, have good management, positive cash flow and proof of delivering profits. They have a lot of cash after selling one of their drugs last year and plenty of patents. They have attracted the attention of a couple of hedge funds, the head of one was prosecuted by the SEC for putting out false information (Greg Lemelson) a couple of years ago. This has resulted in some wild swings in the share price (manipulation perhaps?). Ligand have previously had share buyback programmes and do not correctly pay a dividend.

In short I like the stock and IMO it has awesome growth potential, although not without risk. This is not for the faint hearted or those with paper hands.

2021-05-09 16:28:20,stocks,"KWS and SUMO are both video game developers. The thing I like about them is that they don't develop their own IP. They help other studios develop their own games. This is great because both companies don't have to worry about making hit after hit. Meanwhile big name developers who actually have to make hit games are looking to outsource more and more work. It's great setup for both companies.

TM17 I'm not too sure about this one. They develop games based on their own IP but also act as publisher for indie titles. I'm not too convinced with this one but will give it a year or so to prove itself.

IDEA is critical and niche software developers. They own their niche. Management seems competent. Expanding to US. Could get acquired at nice premium or continue growing. I'm fine with either.

GBG is online identity verification software. When you do online shopping or maybe apply for credit card online or something like that vendors need to verify that you are real person. They provide APIs to do that. They are good at what they do and CV19 has increased demand for this kind of service. However, they operate in competitive sector where many big players are moving in.

MIRI my moonshot all or nothing holding. They embed contextual advertising using AI real time into existing videos. Go see what they do and how it works on YouTube. It's bloody amazing. Alas it's new tech micro cap.

CLG this one does not look like tech at first look but actually a lot of their revenue comes from software solutions. The other part of business is warehousesing and logistics which you might think is boring but because of Covid equities that operate in this sector are on absolute tear. People order online more, means more business for CLG. They also deal with returns. Software solutions are nice added call option.

Edit: to be clear if you was to start new position in above equities, they are expensive by now so not investment recommendation at these prices."

2021-05-09 00:00:00,stocks,"How many stocks do you own for maximum return? I own about 60 stocks. I know people that own only 2 stocks: Amazon and Apple. From what I can see, the return on my 60 stocks can be worse then the return on just owning Apple and Amazon when combined these 2 stocks have an annual return of around 30%. How do you decide on how many stocks to own?"
2021-05-09 01:51:04,stocks,"With regard to risk, I guess my perspective is that 2 strong stocks can serve you well, but AMZN and AAPL and MSFT are so large it is hard to imagine them being 10-baggers.

With my smaller investments I aim for companies with more risk, more reward.

60 stocks is too much for me, too much to keep track of. If you see something good, something REALLY good, why would you not put a heavy stake in it?

I am a 20-stock guy, it is enough excitement and diversity to be fun, rewarding, and buffered from my entire portfolio's performance being dictated by the ups and downs of 1 stock. Despite having 20 stocks, 70% of my holdings are in 2 stocks."
2021-05-09 02:03:42,stocks,If you want exposure to diversity without the headache of managing 60 stocks.  Pick 5 etfs.  Way easier.
2021-05-09 02:35:13,stocks,"You cannot just look at return, building a portfolio is all about maximizing your risk-adjusted return. Maximizing return fir a given level of risk and minimizing risk for given target return.  Portfolio theory shows more is better, but realistically the the advantage of having more than 30 is not very big if you select securities that optimize diversification. For example, buying DE(Deere), CAT (caterpillar), and CNHI(case new Holland) will give you fairly divers tractor portfolio, but if you want to build a large industrial portfolio it would be a bad play since they are all highly correlated. To reduce risk but keep large industrial exposure you could add in something that has low correlation to agriculture, maybe HON or BA. 

The idea is to select some stocks you like that don’t necessarily all move together to minimize individual company risk. Owning 1 or 2 stocks that do great is great, but what if those two end up being Enron and worldcom? Or in the tractor portfolio, what if there a major drought and farmers can’t buy new equipment? A stock can go to zero, but stocks likely won’t."

2021-05-09 03:32:16,stocks,"No right answer, it depends on your risk tolerance and conviction in the equity you are buying. You can scroll through the portfolios below to see how many the well respected fund managers buy. The lowest I saw was like 5-7 with Pershing Square or Himalaya. Some of these funds dumped 40-50% in their highest conviction holding too. If you’re at 60 you may as well own an index fund.

2021-05-09 03:28:56,stocks,"I mean obviously the biggest returns come from just owning one stock. It also come with the biggest downside. The smallest return come from owning everything, but I also come with the smallest downside (stock wise).

I keep between 15 and 30 stocks. That’s enough for me to diversify geographically, across sectors and between small/medium/large caps. It’s also not so many that I can’t (somewhat) keep up with them, but not so few that none of them are ever good value (since I’m still buying), or that I can’t diversify.

If you own only Apple or Amazon (beware of hindsight bias) you are exposed to company specific risks, mega cap risks, large cap risks, US specific risks, sector specific risks, general market risks, and depending on where you live, also currency risks. By diversifying more you can lower that risk to just the market risk.

Most people say that around 20 stocks is enough to reduce most of your company specific risks to negligible levels, but anything between 5 and 40 will do. Above 40 you are probably better off buying an ETF."
2021-05-09 02:40:25,stocks,"It depends how many you can follow closely, the available time you have.   
I make that decision by how strong is the bullish case of the stocks I have spotted.   
For example, my previous pick which was 70% of my portfolio was TEDU, because it was obvious that no matter what the markets will do, TEDU will go private at $4 while I had the opportunity to buy it at $3-$3.10. TEDU did it and I sold at $3.83.   
For the same reason, now I'm buying SECO around $2.50, it will go private at $3.27 and I will sell it around $3.15 until the end of May.   
If there wasn't such special situation stocks, I wouldn't put more than a 15% in a single stock."

How do I decide? I like the products of the company which I buy shares from. If I like their products, that means there are many others who love their products. If there are lots of people like their products, you can't go wrong with your choice.

I wouldn't own any AAPL if  I wasn't using an Iphone. 

Same with PEP. Their cola is just superior. (I do drink Coca cola too but PEP has always something special) 

I use AMD CPU's in all of my computers both desktop and laptop. Looks like I like AMD's products too. (Would like to have some Nvidia shares but they are pricey. They are also great if you can afford the price tag.)

I have many credit cards and all of them are MasterCard but for some reason I bought VISA shares. :)

3M. They make almost everything. Always my first choice. Instant buy.

TLDR; Take a look at which products you use in your daily life the most and buy their shares. If their products somehow reached you and their product is always your first choice (or sometimes second choice), that means they are successful at what they do.

3. Completed  the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the  company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow.
4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M
5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing

I was reading about Long Term capital gains, and supposedly there's 3 options for how much tax you're going to pay. 0 percent, 15 percent and 20 percent. Supposedly, if your yearly income is 40K or less, you pay **ZERO** percent. From $40,001 to $441,450 is 15 percent (most apes). $441,451 and above is 20 percent.

My question is this... Let's say that I bought 100 shares of AMZN for $1700 per share on March 16, 2020 (170k total investment).

Then I sold those 100 shares of AMZN this last April 30th for $3500 per share. My profit would be 180k. If my job in 2020 only paid me 39k in 2020, and I had no other source of income, I'd pay **ZERO** taxes on that 180k profit? Seems way too freaking good to be true.

You have ordinary income of 39000 and long term capital gains of 180000.

Here is how that stack of income gets taxed in 2020 if you are single:

12400 ordinary at 0% = 0  
9875 ordinary at 10% = 988  
16725 ordinary at 12% = 2007  

13400 ltcg at 0% = 0  
166600 ltcg at 15% = 24990

Total income tax 2995, total cap gains tax 24990. Overall total tax 27985.

---

Notes

The 12400 is standard deduction not part of taxable income. 

Then 39000 – 12400 = 26600 of taxable income is chunked into the tax brackets, putting 9875 in 10% bracket (filling it) and putting 16725 in 12% bracket (only partially filled). 

The first 40000 of taxable income (above standard deduction) is occupied by 9875 + 16725 ordinary income + 13400 cap gains. It's just those 13400 cap gains that get the 0% cap gains tax rate.

The rest of the cap gains, 180000 – 13400 = 166600, get the 15% cap gains tax rate."

In this case (let's ignore any deductions for simplicity and single filer) ur total income is 180k + 39k

Ur taxable income is the same (since we keeping this simple and ignoring deductions) 

Ur ordinary income is 39k. Ur long term gains is 180k.


Ur taxes are now as followed

* 10% on first 9950 = 995
* 12% on 9951 - 39k = 3486

Now long term gains.

* 0 - 40400 is 0% so ur first 1400 of ur 180k is taxed at 0%
* leftover 178600 is 15% = 26790

Total taxed just add them up.

Easiest analogy i was told is to think of tax bracket as buckets. And income as water of different colors.

U first fill up the bucket with regular water (ordinary income. Ie most commonly from ur job) and next fill it up with red water (LTCG).

Only the amount of red water that spills over is taxed at next tax bracket"

According to this, you can make exactly 40k or less per year and pay 0% on your long term capital gains. However, unlike my example with AMZN, that trade wouldn't work, it would count towards your total income and take you WAY over the 40k threshold.

But... Imagine that somebody is just living off savings. They're unemployed. They have zero income. They could then cash in on Long Term capital gains each year, to the tune of exactly 40k, and pay zero taxes on it. 

Of course, in that scenario, you'd keep rolling over long term bets into future years, not selling... but cashing it out on exactly 40k profit each near, but not earning a penny more. There must be somebody out there living in a retrofitted van, doing this lol.."

That's where the media gets the rich only pay 12 percent in taxes from. 0 plus 15 plus 20 equals 35 divided by 3 brackets equals between 12 and 13 percent.

It's ridiculous to figure out the average tax rate that way because it equally weights the 3 tax brackets, but it feeds well into the hate the rich narrative."

Then so on
I could be wrong bc I don’t know you full financial picture however 


You would be able to pull 10k of nontaxed unrealized gains only at these brackets but above then you start paying capital gains

The rub is these are long term capital gains (hold asset one year) if less than a year it’s short term capital gains. 

Short term you pay your tax bracket %. So if you cashed in 40,399 of unrealized gains of less than a year you would just go up a bracket there is no 10k free long term capital gains 

You can also tax harvest aka you lost money bs cost basis you could pull out more unrealized gains until your cost basis is same as realized gains and it’s tax free. 

Keep in mind you also have your standard deduction, plus tax deferred retirement plans. If you are married have defendants etc you can get more standard deduction if you claim them obviously

This is my understanding. I utilized capital gains to bring my yearly to 40,399. Worked part time and in grad school"

2021-05-09 07:09:42,stocks,"Long term capital gain rate depends on where the gains sit in your stack of taxable income. 

Your ordinary income does influence this, because you can consider the cap gains as sitting on top of the ordinary income.

After subtracting 12400 standard deduction, there is 26600 of taxable income (some gets taxed at 10% and some at 12%) and then there is 13400 of space left in the first 40000 of taxable income. That 13400 gets the 0% cap gain rate. 

But then all the other cap gains, 180000 – 13400, is sitting in the zone of ""taxable income above 40000"" that gets a 15% tax rate.

2021-05-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Buying overvalued stocks. Just want to get some experience and opinions here.  Obviously we should avoid overvalued stocks, because best case scenario there's not so much room to run, and worst case scenario they can actually plummet.  By overvalued I mean when the market value of the stock exceeds its intrinsic value, which can be calculated in different ways.  I find both [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st) and [macroaxis.com](https://macroaxis.com) useful for a quick, automated reading.  I also understand that you can calculate it by hand, which I don't thanks to the wide variety of resources and analysts out there.

Anyway, I think most people would agree that the market is pretty high right now.  Are there deals to be had?  For sure!  And I think if you can find them, then that's obviously the best option.

But what do you guys think about buying a company that is slightly overvalued according to traditional metrics?  I'm not talking about Tesla here.  I'm talking about a blue-chip stock that may be trading 5-15% over what's considered fair.

Arguments against: it's a bad deal.

Arguments for: it may have more room to run, and time in the market beats timing the market.  If it's a good company you'll eventually recoup the initial investment and make gains even if it takes a bit longer.

Also keep in mind that I'm a small-time retail investor, as I'm sure many of us are.  Let's imagine I want to invest $1000 and I find a company with a fair value of $90, but it's trading at $100 currently.  I decide to go ahead and buy it, which would mean I'm paying a $100 premium for 10 shares of that company.

Is $100 really a big deal?  Again, as long as it's a good company with realistic prospects for growth, then sooner or later the stock's intrinsic value will surpass the market value.  You're out $100 that you could have invested in better value, but at the same time you've locked yourself in to a good company with good long-term growth prospects.

If it were a $100,000 investment, of course, you have a bigger issue.  Percentage wise it's the same, but I think you could argue that an extra $100 isn't really worth splitting hairs about.  $10,000 might be.

I also considered that you could balance out overvalued companies with undervalued ones.  Instead of buying 10 overvalued companies, which start to add up, you could lock yourself into 5 high-conviction overvalued companies, and balance them out with 5 undervalued plays to net a fair purchase value.

What do you guys think?  Do you buy overvalued companies, or do you do all that you can to avoid them?"

This is true, but some companies are overvalued precisely because they are seen as safe investments and will weather a downturn better than the market.  Think blue-chips.  The overall return may be less, but then again, so will the volatility.  It depends on your needs and risk tolerance.

>Your 'argument for' doesn't really make sense. The only argument for buying an overvalued company's stock is that your valuation, and anyone else who thinks it is overvalued, could be wrong.

The overvalued stocks may be overvalued for a reason: they're safer.  The undervalued companies may have great financials and the whole 9 yards, but they may also involve a degree of uncertainty as to their future.  The discount you're getting is because of that uncertainty.

In that sense balancing overvalued, safe stocks with undervalued, riskier stocks would allow for the perfect amount of balance and diversification.  

If you can find 10 stocks that are undervalued and reliable, then obviously that's the best play.  But I find that to be unlikely, and I don't have the time nor the know-how to be able to do that.  You will probably recommend index funds: see above."

Sure tech numbers have been great, but plenty of businesses within the S&P are struggling to get back onto their feet. Also, I wonder how much of an effect Tesla has on that number. Its surely helped to inflate it considering its market cap."
2021-05-08 21:15:44,stocks,"While this is true, I would argue that there's a difference between chasing a high-flying tech stock and paying a small premium for a strong blue-chip company.  Overall returns may be less in the long-run, but volatility may actually be less, too."
2021-05-08 22:36:53,stocks,"That analogy doesn't work, because cars lose value with time.  Investments gain value, especially when they're good ones."
2021-05-08 22:21:39,stocks,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty certain that the metrics used to calculate intrinsic value take into account growth rates and future earnings.  Thus the issue with buying a company that is considered overvalued.

That said, I think that these rates are generated extrapolating past data, or using subjective analyst predictions, so it's not exactly science.  If you truly believe in Tesla's ability to disrupt the market, for example, then you might value the stock much higher than most formulas would."
2021-05-08 21:43:34,stocks,"You asked for opinions, and apparently you don't like mine. It seems you are just looking for people to tell you it is okay to invest in overvalued stocks. If you really like a stock, then invest in it. If you're interested in maximizing your returns, then I would advise against it."

2021-05-08 22:35:02,stocks,It depends on which type of analysis your doing. Personally I prefer to just measure p/X x growth rate adjusted for historical average of metric. Thats very objective and you cannot just add value in any way as there are no assumptive variables. It either is or it isn’t. There are many models out there that overcomplicate things by adding probability assumptions and crap that analysts just use to say what they what it to say.
2021-05-08 21:46:05,stocks,"It's not that I don't like it, it's just that I disagree with it given my risk tolerance and investment needs.  I can't afford to take on whole market risk right now.  That for me is more important than maximizing my returns at the moment.

I don't necessarily want people just to give me the green light, it's more about seeing what people have to say and how it holds up against the way I see my current situation.  I appreciate you sharing your perspective so I can check it against mine."
2021-05-08 20:53:45,stocks,"Yes of course, the list of failed companies is long.  Which is why you diversify your investments."
2021-05-08 20:53:27,stocks,"That's a great point, although I think this sort of thing is much more probable with innovative new tech companies than with companies with stable, steady growth, reliable products, and strong free cash flow.  Ie Nestle."
2021-05-08 22:03:37,stocks,And put in the job line - I worked for JDS around 2000. What a shit show.
2021-05-08 21:34:49,stocks,"I totally agree, I would only say that in a market with valuations this high we have to put our money *somewhere*, and paying a small premium for a reliable company with good growth prospects may trump buying a less reliable company at a discount.

There obviously comes a point where the premium is much too high and even a reliable company becomes a risk."
2021-05-08 22:38:35,stocks,I see.  So you're saying the intrinsic value using the objective analysis you provided can be misleading?
2021-05-08 21:48:59,stocks,Whole market risk? An index fund is about the safest thing you can invest in. I can't think of a single scenario in which investing in 10 different stocks is less risky than investing in the index.
2021-05-08 21:05:35,stocks,"JDSU IPOed 7 years before it crashed.  Also, as far as products go, it's still around.  Its remnants are now Viavi and Lumentum."
2021-05-08 22:45:41,stocks,"What I was originally saying was that investors often take metrics without consideration of growth rates. And some models are not objective when they rely heavily on future assumptions. Future cash flow models that include what a business might make can get weird when analysts love a company and add all sorts of crap to bolster future cash flows. 

Imo its better to take historical growth rate as a trend and assume the same rate or preferably less. If the stocks price today is going to give you two to three times in 5 years after cutting their growth rate in half and normalizing to avg metric value - shes a winner."
2021-05-08 21:55:42,stocks,">An index fund is about the safest thing you can invest in.

With a time horizon of decades, you're right.

With a time horizon of just a few years, it can absolutely be riskier.  When you buy an index, you live and die by the market.  You get eaten by the biggest losers in a downturn just as much as the big winners propel you forward during a bull market.  Some defensive and blue-chip stock tend to perform better than other stocks during a downturn.

This is not something I've invented.  See [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defensivestock.asp).

You can also diversify in about 12-18 stocks and receive most of the benefits of diversification without the need for an entire index."
2021-05-08 21:09:06,stocks,"Yeah, I got you.  It's just that these crazy high run-ups and valuations aren't really what I'm talking about.  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDSU):

>During the 1990s, JDS Uniphase stock was a high-flyer tech stock investor favorite. Its stock price doubled three times

I don't like to ride waves up.  But a little high-tide on a blue-chip seems OK to me."
2021-05-08 22:48:06,stocks,"Ok, I see."
2021-05-08 21:58:43,stocks,If you’re planning to pull your investment out after a few years then buying an overvalued company makes way less sense.
2021-05-08 22:04:18,stocks,"Again, no.  Because the primary objective is not returns; it's safety.  Safety first.  I prefer a safe place to park my money to making excellent returns.  I could just hold in cash or a savings account, but those are both horrible options at the moment.  I prefer to pick up the dividends and cash in on the modest but reliable gains.

Also, I'm not totally sure if I'm going to need the money in a few years.  I might need all of it, I might need some of it, I might need none of it.  If I take out just 50%, the other 50% still has room to ride until retirement.

There is the risk of the overvaluation being too high, at which case even the most reliable company has a higher probability of giving me a negative return with this time horizon.  Another poster brought this up and this is noted."
2021-05-09 00:30:12,stocks,"Stocks aren’t safe. Not even blue chips. The market can take down every stock. A bond would be safer, even high yield."
2021-05-09 03:26:25,stocks,"I don't like bonds because they are way overbought and rates are horrible. Real yields are negative.  What I'm saying about buying ""safe"", dividend-paying stocks is not something I just made up.  Of course there is risk there.  It's not a 1 or 0 question, and this is the middle ground approach that makes sense to me right now."
2021-05-09 10:48:14,stocks,"OP, a rry to say but you're not understanding. Safe is a HYSA with retuens under 1% mensing a real negative, semi safe are bonds which also fall short of inflation. ETFs are riskier but better returns and stocks have *even higher risk*. Dividend can be cut tomorrow, bad news, pandemics/war/scandals can happen within days and totally *ruin* an otherwise good stock.



Safe isn't profitable now. The only way to get returns is gambling on the market, the safest bet is a whole market index like VOO with some added bonds to decrease volition. ETFs are safer then stocks, market is correlated. If you are adamant about dividends look at *dividend aristocrats* but do know that their share epricw can drop sharp...making the dividend useless."
2021-05-09 13:41:30,stocks,"Incorrect.  Imagine a company trading at $50, and paying a 5% dividend yield.  If the share price falls in half, that same dividend becomes 10%.  If it's consumer staples and/or a blue-chip company, that dividend is likely recession proof.  During a downturn stocks that sell staples and with high dividend yields (which, again, are even higher if share price drops)  are exactly where investors want to put their money, cushioning the initial blow and even causing the stock to bounce back rapidly.  I'm not making this up:

https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/defensive-stock/

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defensivestock.asp

You also receive that fixed income yourself, which also helps cushion the blow. 

Bonds are horrible right now.  You pay the government to hold their debt. 

Index funds are not always the safest, no.  Maybe for a time horizon of decades, but that's not necessarily my time horizon. 

""By contrast, because most indexes weight components by market capitalization (stock price multiplied by shares outstanding), they impose no checks on ballooning, overvalued stocks and sectors, which account for an ever-increasing portion of the index as those assets keep rising. That leaves investors in funds that mirror the index exposed in a falling market, when those overvalued stocks and sectors usually lose the most. Investors worried about holding outsize stakes in pricey assets might note the 11% weighting of FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet) in the S&P 500, or the overall 24% weighting of technology stocks in the index.""

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/t041-c009-s002-the-perils-of-investing-in-index-funds.html%3famp

With the Covid crash you also had full exposure to industries that were devastated: ie, travel and hotels. 

With index funds, as I've said before, you live and die by the market. You get all the winners in a bull market, yes, but you also get all the losers in a bear market. Some stocks are less volatile than the market, in fact there are low volatility ETFs if you prefer that approach, see here: https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-find-low-volatility-stocks-4163622

As for bad news hurting a company, that's why you diversify.  The number I've heard is that you can receive most of the benefits of diversification with about 12-18 stocks. If you prefer the low volatility ETF, then go for it.  I enjoy stock picking.

Frankly I don't understand why people are insistent on telling me my approach is the wrong approach *for me*.  I have done my research, I haven't invented any new ideas here, and this is what seems to make the most sense for me.  It doesn't mean that it's wrong to invest in index funds.  My entire retirement account is in index funds."

2021-05-08 20:28:05,stocks,"unrealized gains and fluctuations before you actually sell don’t matter

to calculate gains and losses, i simply: take the price at which i sold the stock (selling price) and subtract the cost at which i bought it (purchasing price). i take the result of that equation and divide it by the purchasing price, multiply by 100 and have the percentage. for example:

if you buy a stock at 10$, sell it at 13$. that’s 13-10=3, and then 3/10 x 100 = 30%"

The only ""flaw"" here was that you looked at them as 2 different steps, meaning to get your 150% you also halfed his initial investment, which is not possible - and to be fair, that's due to his wording.

Cons: cities are regulating - or attempting to regulate - ABNB; covid stifled their growth and reduced their revenue for more than a year

  
Pros: service is a part of everyday language (people saying ""I'm going to ABNB a place when I go to Spain"" for example)  
\- most their hosts and guests LOVE ABNB over any hotel or other private booking website because it feels that they are more immersed in the local culture, especially if they get to meet the host(s)  
\- post-covid growth  
\- for now, they seem to find ways to overcome restrictions in most places (for example, when I lived in NYC they restricted the ABNB rentals for minimum of one month, but I feel that there was still a LOT of ABNB-ing even after that and that it significantly slowed down only during covid)."

Airbnb is a verb and a noun. VRBO, not so much. Airbnb has a better selection, a better designed app/website, and more trust built into it than VRBO.

Airbnb also protects Hosts and Guests with insurance up to $1 million. VRBO doesn't have nearly the same protections build into their service."
2021-05-08 20:51:37,stocks,That's very true. Good point.
2021-05-09 08:46:58,stocks,"The one thing that Airbnb has over any hotel is the fact that I can take my entire family to a literal house and be able to cook meals at home



Don't get me wrong they have these Extended Stay places that have that option but in my experience and I traveled a lot but my family they are small and usually not very nice and the fact is if you have more than a standard family you're going to need more than one room so Airbnb has always won out for me"
2021-05-08 21:25:46,stocks,So you think because of strong competition they aren't as good as they seem?

2021-05-08 23:48:40,stocks,"Yes, to be fair, as a former renter in Manhattan, I hated the rent hike that was happening because many apartment buildings turned into semi-hotels. I'm sure some of it was illegal, but it seemed to me that a lot of tourists were also willing to rent for a month, and perhaps share it with friends (such as two weeks one couple, next two weeks another couple). I'm originally from Europe, and I feel like Europeans prefer ABNB-ing to hotels. In other words, I don't think ABNB is going anywhere any time soon, even if there are restrictions."
2021-05-08 23:58:10,stocks,"I used to think this but now I'm not so sure. Some things to consider:

- While there will certainly be an increase in business due to travel, there's also going to be a ton of competition from hotels that are recovering from the pandemic. To attract customers they'll be offering rates that are competitive with AirBNB. Will people still bother when they can stay at a nice hotel for a similar price?

- AirBNB was considered a safe option for travelers during the pandemic, but now that everyone is getting vaccinated they won't be as hesitant to stay at a hotel. That's one competitive advantage gone.

- A lot of people want to splurge on a vacation after a year of being locked up, and AirBNB has kind of a low-budget vibe that might not be appealing to them. 

- There are already movements being made to restrict AirBNB which will only get worse as more people use their services and disrupt local communities. The next few months could accelerate this process if a travel boom occurs.

I don't think it's necessarily a bad investment though. The sheer increase in demand could end up outweighing all of those headwinds. People can't seem to decide if the company is overvalued or undervalued which suggests to me that it's actually close to fair value now. Take that as you will."

There appears to be no appetite for growth stocks with lofty valuations. This could be due to the inflationary environment or pending rate increases. Yes I think long term it will be good, but no I am not entering here as I see these growth stocks sliding in the short term."

2021-05-09 17:54:07,stocks,"Yeah but I'm sure that in the future they will start bringing in a profit, all this talk about legalisation seems to be all talk. Airbnb is used by millions and it saves millions of people (and makes money for people too) a lot of money. The government regulating them will happen but it won't destroy them, it will just slow them down. Every company has been regulated and been attacked by the government and they are doing fine. All the big fangs have been regulated and they don't stop going up."
2021-05-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Alibaba: A Short Analysis **What does Alibaba do?**

First and foremost, they are an online commerce platform. They sell retail, they sell wholesale, they sell single items, they sell container loads of items. This also includes a logistics platform and global fulfillment network, Cainiao Network, and an on-demand delivery and services platform, Ele.me. Then, they also have a rapidly expanding cloud business in addition to some small entertainment, gaming and other business units, but in this analysis I'll mainly focus on the online commerce and the cloud business as they are the two pillars of Alibaba's business strategy.

So, let's look at the online commerce. Is it doing well? Well? It's doing fantastic! The last year, it grew by 35% YoY! Over the last 5 years, online commerce sales increased by almost 500% from 92 billion RMB in 2016 to 436 billion in 2020. To give you an idea, 1 US dollar was roughly 7.08 RMB then so Alibaba's online commerce revenue in 2020 was roughly $61.5 Billion. Revenue is extremely important for business growth so seeing a 35 PERCENT increase is amazing! In fact, this is almost unheard of for businesses of this size which just shows you how unique Alibaba is. Then, the adjusted earnings from online commerce also grew by roughly 22% to 165 billion RMB or $23.4 billion. So, how are they doing THAT well? Simple! They did get the boost in online sales because of the pandemic, but they also have 780 MILLION active consumers on their online marketplaces in China and another 190 millions internationally as of the end of 2020. They also have 846 Million Mobile Monthly Active users. Essentially, they've got more customers that the population of the US and EU COMBINED!

So, Alibaba's online marketplaces include several websites, but not just any websites. In fact, the company owns 2 of the 10 most visited websites IN. THE. WORLD. Tmall and Taobao. Alipay ranks in 26th place and Aliexpress ranks in 42nd place. The company presence is just mindboggling. And, to top it all off, the business model is much lighter than Amazon's, for example. Why? Well, Alibaba does not sell its own products, it doesn't have any inventory, doesn't have any warehouses, which results in less expenses and a higher net profit. How much higher? Well, Amazon's latest net profit margin is 5.53%. Alibaba's? 24.71%!

So, the online commerce is the main driver behind Alibaba's amazing performance as currently none of the other business segments are producing any meaningful earnings. In fact, the digital media and entertainment and the innovation incentives and others segments are actually losing money, although the CEO has explained that their purpose is not to be profitable, but rather to augment the Alibaba brand and support the online commerce platform. Now, the cloud computing is different. In the 4th quarter of 2020, it finally broke even! It is an important part of Alibaba's long-term strategy and they are placing a lot of emphasis on growing it. In 2020, cloud revenues grew by almost 62%! Alibaba Cloud is currently the biggest cloud provider in China and they intend to stay that way.

Overall, the company is growing fast, roughly 38% increase in sales YoY with net income rising roughly 70% in the last year! We can see that the core business and the future business of Alibaba are doing well. How are its financials though? Well, it has a lot of cash, roughly 330 Billion RMB and its current assets are enough to cover all of its liabilities so they are looking very healthy. In fact, they've got enough free cash to start repurchasing shares. In the final quarter of 2020, they repurchased roughly $110 million US dollars which is not that much honestly, but they've approved a share repurchase plan of between $6 and $10 Billion. If we see them acting on that plan, investors could get very excited! So, the business is growing fast, the financials look solid, they're starting to return money to the shareholders. What about their price?

Well, the company is relatively cheap right now. Their PE ratio is 25.5 with a forward PE of 20.6. Historically, they have a PE average of 34.5 so we can see that they are on a big discount right now. Their PB ratio is 5 which is normal for them so there's that. Compared to their direct Chinese competitors, Alibaba's PE isn't actually that low, but I'd say that the reason behind it is that most of its rivals are only involved in online commerce whereas Alibaba is also the leader in the rapidly growing cloud computing business. Also, if we compare Alibaba to Amazon which is pretty much the closest comparison we can get in terms of business segments, we can see that Amazon's PE has not dropped below 60 in the last 5 years and their average is 137.2, way higher than Alibaba! Amazon's PB ratio is also roughly 18 or almost 2 and a half times higher than Alibaba's! Their revenues and earnings are growing at roughly the same pace although Amazon had a phenomenal year in 2020.

But, they've also beaten the last 10 analysts earnings estimates and the last 8 revenue estimates so they tend to outperform although I think that their next quarterly earnings will be a miss due to the fine that was imposed on them. Basically, we can see that investors have not priced in the growth in the share price which essentially means that Alibaba is a great deal, at least in my opinion. It's no wonder that virtually all of the analyst recommendations for this stock are either BUY or STRONG BUY (Yahoo finance screenshot). Also, most of their competitors are focused only on online commerce which means that Alibaba has a better overall offering and competitive advantage than them. It's got better sales, better net profit margin, better brand presence, better long-term strategy AND more users than Pinduoduo, Vipshop, JD. Clearly, it's the better deal, at least in my opinion, but in all fairness even its competitors are doing really well. Some people who agree with me are Ray Dalio whose 3rd biggest stock holding is Alibaba and Charlie Munger who just bought into it with 20% of his Daily Journal portfolio.

Now, this stock just looks to good to be true, right? Sort of. Alibaba does have some issues, but they're of slightly different nature. The main risks involved with the company are more... political. First of all, you have the SEC threatening to delist any companies that are doing business with the Chinese military, that don't provide proper financial statements and reporting, that have a Chinese Communist Party member on their board OR are controlled by an entity of a foreign government. Now, technically speaking, just because a company is delisted doesn't mean that you cannot trade it, but chances are that its stock price will be hurt... A LOT. You'd still be able to trade it over-the-counter, but that brings a lot of problems of its own and also chances are that most normal online brokers won't support it. I know that my broker, eToro, does not. Still, you can easily avoid that by simply buying Alibaba's stock that is trading on the Hong Kong exchange. The ticker is 9988, but it's essentially the same stock. Personally, I don't think that's going to happen, but don't take my word for it. Buying the Hong Kong stock will ensure you are protected from the delisting.

That isn't all though. Currently, there is also an ongoing regulation crackdown in China aimed at Chinese big tech companies. Alibaba was famously targeted because Jack Ma, its founder, made criticised the Chinese government's approach to financial regulations. As a result, the IPO for Ant Group, which is essentially Alibaba's spin-off that deals with consumer financing and lending, was squashed late last year and restructuring was ordered. More recently, more regulations and restructuring was ordered. While this has affected Alibaba's business model to an extent, the regulations have also affected Alibaba's direct competitors so the company still retains its competitive advantage. The regulators also handed Alibaba a fine of $2.8 BILLION US dollars, the biggest one ever handed... so far. They also ordered the company to stop its anti-competitive practices which involved Alibaba making merchants choose between using only Alibaba or rival platforms. So, are the regulators finished with Alibaba? Well, we can only speculate. The biggest worry that investors have is that the regulators will break up Alibaba into different smaller businesses, which is a possibility although a lot of analysts say that China will not risk destroying one of its biggest and most famous companies. They do seem to have moved on to the other tech companies, but as I said this is not something that you can know for certain.

So, what's the verdict? Is Alibaba a good investment right now? Personally, I think so. It is undoubtedly risky, but the company offers such amazing prospects that it's just crazy to miss out on. I mean, if you could buy Amazon at such a cheap price, wouldn't you? I'd recommend doing your own research into it, but I believe that it offers a great opportunity right now and that's why it is my second largest holding and almost 10% of my total portfolio. 

Finally, Alibaba will be reporting its 2021 quarter 1 earnings next Thursday so check this out to see what could happen. There will probably be a lot of price action before that and likely after it, hopefully in a nice positive green upward trajectory.

That's my analysis on Alibaba. There's a lot more to talk about, but I wanted to keep it on the short side. What do you think?

2021-05-09 00:28:19,stocks,"It looks painful right now to be holding BABA, but big gains don’t come easy. I bought the dips on Facebook when they were facing antitrust charges. Everyone was saying that it would dip further. I was holding it for a while, it would go up and then come right back down. Right now it’s over $300 and hit a high of $330.

Just remember that a company with the fundamentals of Ali Baba at this price is a steal. Buy it now and just don’t look at your account for a year or two. You’ll be kicking yourself when it’s at $350+ EOY and $500+ in two years."

Say what you will about the Chinese government but there is no way The current US admin will push for BABA to be delisted for any reason, regardless of merit. This is a safe bet.

So Bangladesh has a notorious rat problem and hubby and I knew we’d end up eating a bit of rat droppings as all who visit do and many fall horribly sick.  So we wanted to mend this issue and we bought a cheap little rat from a pet store and ate at first the smallest bit of droppings just to get it into our system. I’m talking the smallest amount ever.  Anyways did this for twice per day for one week and then increased amount the next week, next week, next, for a total of 24 weeks.  By the time we got to Bangladesh we had our immune systems primed for a bit of droppings in our food.  The verdict? We literally had no problems at all.

The whole Ant thing will definitely put a little ding in their business, but I think other developments will more than  compensate for that. 

Plus, Alibaba only holds 33% in Ant which is significant, but it also means that other parties are risking more. Also, their strategy is to further separate the management of the two companies as that was drawing political fire from the CCP. Jack Ma is more involved with Ant."

2021-05-09 17:29:50,stocks,"Sorry for the long answer: I prefer if possible to invest in Expenses rather than profits of an industry.

China Life insurance & others have to pay companies like HUIZ before they can make a profit. (Investing in someone who benefits in the Expenses of the China Life In.)

I did this before with the Pot industry. It was a newish industry (similar to insurance in China). So instead of picking which Pot stock to buy (Which probably would have made more $ but was more risky) I decided to buy IIPR.  They operated the grow houses (The Rent & PPE expenses) of those grow houses that I was previously looking into. I tripled. Bought IIPR at around 78$.  It sits at $184 now. I sold because the Biden WH will eventually loosen Pot regulations & allow financing for Pot businesses, which was a big part of IIPR biz model. So I took the $ and ran.  Yes it could have went higher, but I was content.  I also believe what is keeping it up is that Commercial Real Estate is garbage RN & many REIT’s are not as safe as they once were for Commercial.

**Container shipping industry has grown tremendously in last 12 months. Companies like DAC, ZIM, NMM are very cheap after the huge growth, P/E< 10. I believe there is still 50-100% upside in short term (5-6 months). The following DD I took from WSB written by** [u/c12mintz](https://www.reddit.com/u/c12mintz/) **(5 weeks prior). I hold positions in the aforementioned companies and long for them**. **I removed some part of the post as it violates** r/stocks **rules.**

I posted on here [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldcdr7/container_ship_boom_update_rates_surging_higher/) sharing some top picks across the containership industry. Rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) are still going ballistic and have already exceeded my most bullish expectations. More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels. The world's containership liners clearly believe the strong rates are here to stay through at least 2023-2024.

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

I’m currently long about every name possible in the sector and although I've taken some profits in certain names to be responsible and lock in profits, I've also added a lot to a couple key beneficiaries including Navios Partners (NMM) and Zim Integrated (ZIM).

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021.

As I noted above, containerships are ***not*** like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 *day* voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures. Much of 2021 is already locked in for these companies and we're now looking at solidifying coverage into 2022-2023+.

I believe we’re probably 4th or 5th inning here. For my disclosure, I’m \*still\* very long nearly all the key names in the space- $ATCO $CPLP $DAC $MPCC (Oslo) $NMM and $ZIM. Keep in mind that nothing here constitutes investment advice in any form or fashion! I'm just talking about stocks I personally like.

They provide literally any equipment you’d need on a construction site.

No matter what data you’re looking at in the past year. They’ve not taken a lose once. No one can say when this winning streak will come to an end. However with the demand for construction sky rocketing. One can only speculate, it won’t be anytime soon. This is largely due to COVID restrictions being lifted as well as Biden’s infrastructure bill.

Now let’s focus a little on the infrastructure bill aspect. There’s a lot of speculation which companies will benefit the most from this. Though trying to pinpoint who’ll be the lowest bidder is close to impossible. So let’s focus on what we know for a fact. No matter what construction companies get the contracts, one thing remains. They’re gonna need a lot of supplies for the job. That’s where TEX the glorious Terex shines.

Peace out"
2021-05-08 20:07:14,stocks,"Intel is losing their dominance in server chips, this will be a slow drag on profitability until they can regain their lead.  AMD has tapped TSMC to produce for them on the 7nm architecture, Intel seems to be stuck at 10nm, despite best efforts to introduce 7nm fabrication.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/CES-2021/AMD-unwraps-new-server-chips-in-latest-grab-for-Intel-business

Ultimately, I think Intel will be in for a tough year on comps, but with the global semi shortage, margins should still be healthy for everybody.  With their balance sheet, I don't expect them to lag in technology for long, and ultimately will be successful in introducing 7nm or less chips.  $22B in cash buys you a fair amount of time.

Even if their 2022 EPS came in near 0 (estimates currently a $4+/shr) as they dumped legacy chips onto the market (not going to happen IMO), there is potential for a much higher valuation as they retool foundries for their next generation.

A few years without huge success does not equate to a dead company.  Microsoft pretty much flatlined as a stock for 10 years, and look at this latest run.  Not everyone needs high end chips.

I wouldn't buy options, because I can't pick when their turnaround will come, but think it will come.  This may trade back towards $50 again, maybe even 40s.

Also, there is the whole Mobileye wildcard.  They could end up making a breakthrough in self driving, and become the industry leader.  If Tesla is worth a trillion according to some analyst, based on being the first, any signs of success could rocket INTCs valuation.

Usually america does it when a company has a monopoly and there's not enough competition.     
China is doing it because baba is becoming competitive to govt in influence.    
    
They also were told this week they have to divest a property reselling or some part. It's probably why stock reset to 226 again.    
    
Baba was fined maybe 2 weeks ago and I thought that was their last punishment personally but they just keep coming....
    
Also now china wants to have ccp (china communist party) member(s) on the board of directors of baba. They want to have a say in how the company is run on a permanent basis.    
It would be like having a cop in all your meetings. And a cop who can say or do anything and everyone has to agree. You don't and you disappear.      

USA brought out or is bringing out ruling that if there is ccp director in companies it needs to be named on sec filings.     
    
It's an increased risk that baba can be delisted from Us and if that happens there will be mass selling and baba shares will tank.    
    
Personally I think baba should be 300+ share price on company fundamentals.

On top of that, we have earnings this week, which has not gone well for many stocks recently, despite exceeding expectations. I doubt it would tank much considering the support it has had at these levels for quite some time now.

2021-05-08 21:50:57,stocks,"I think my worry about PUTS is I don't even know how to handle the current market, valuation and how momentum has fucked with valuation levels.

Buying PUTS means that I definitely think its overvalued and will go down from this level. In reality, I should have bought puts at $150 because it was crazy over valued then. But it shot up to $180 before cratering, so timing of the puts is critical.

The market can remain irrational way longer than I can predict effective puts on LMND. Its the same reason I wouldn't buy puts on TSLA or QS. Even though their valuations are nosebleed, they have a weird fervorous army of supporters that could pump the price based on one piece of speculative news.

If LMND were to announce that they were getting into ""smart phone insurance"", we could maybe see a weird pump in LMND regardless of how whacky that plan sounds.

I kind of regret even getting into a whacky stock like LMND that is so over valued but full of true believers that causes the stock to irrationally jump around.

One thing I've learned in 2020 and 2021, buying into irrational stocks is a very dangerous game."

2021-05-09 11:47:26,stocks,"I will give it a hard look.  Let me share a very similar story with you.  Look at TTCF.  Cap is $1.36B today which is a pull back from $1.6B and a high growth story.  I rode it from as low as $12 to the mid 20's and rotated out to energy but have rotated back in as it has pulled back to $17.  The growth numbers are still there, with guidance for this year and future growth a bit above when they went public last year."
2021-05-09 13:03:35,stocks,"TTCF doesn't have the revenue or established FCF UNFI has. There are huge fundamental gaps between these two companies.  TTCF is a speculative growth stock and UNFI is a deep value stock.

Not to mention, you've brought up a company that just started trading vs a company that has been public (and highly established) since 1996.

I'm a lot more comfortable owning the well established distributor that will be delivering the frozen meals to grocery stores (that's also dabbling in E-sales) as opposed to picking the frozen meal company that's going to be the next big one.

You could be right about TTCF but there is greater inherent risk considering their future value is entirely speculative and they are currently burning cash. It does sound like you got into TTCF early though, so I do respect that you've stuck to your convictions on it. My main hangup here is I wouldn't look at a company with negative cashflow as a value stock."
2021-05-09 07:57:32,stocks,Thanks for sharing. Do you see growth on T or is it just the dividend?
2021-05-09 07:05:22,stocks,I was holding Sage for a bit but sold them last year. Its super crowded market for HR/Payroll software and they have no moat to speak of. Growth is almost non-existent for the last 3 years and profit margins are at best average for software company.
2021-05-09 07:01:48,stocks,"Diversification is not really about how many equities you hold. Also, important to note, that in his later years Buffet has retracted his criticism of diversification."
2021-05-09 08:27:11,stocks,"I actually do see growth. I think their numbers almost across the board were positive and beat expectations, one of the few dark clouds was certain parts had reduced ARPU, but this is typical when you have churn reductions and cross-sell products / win bigger share of wallet. 

&#x200B;

The main bear case, as I understand it, is the debt, but the debt is largely financed for longer term and low interest, and the business is a cash generating machine that can comfortably cover it. Yeah, pay down the debt so you can focus on growth elsewhere, but I'm not overly concerned by it. 

&#x200B;

I have a $42 target in 2024. As I am averaged now at $30, that is growth of 40% and \~32% divi. If it sees no growth, I still make a near index average return. If it does grow, I have a solid return on a fairly safe and diversified stock. I'm happy with that range of outcomes."
2021-05-09 18:40:41,stocks,"Sage is probably my weakest conviction on the list, but I do think it's undervalued and mis-understood a little bit. It has one of the widest analyst estimates I've ever seen lol. Below is my rationale for holding. 

&#x200B;

The company is moving to a managed service model, meaning revenue and earnings are being deferred. The company still has a fairly solid net margin (high teens), even after it announced it was increasing R&D spend, which is what caused the stock to fall in Nov 20 (my entry point).  Its subscription revenues continue to grow at a reasonable pace, and once they complete working through their contracts (most done in 2 more years) the business will be looking very different and growing with that subscription model without the legacy stuff bogging it down. 

&#x200B;

It announced a fairly decent buyback recently, and its QTRly update in January - in line with expectations - was evidently a surprise to the market and hence the jump, because presumably people expected worse. Consistently, it basically does what it says it will do, and they've established some credibility with me as a result. They have started to throw off fairly decent amounts of cash (hence the buyback) and I am hopeful for a divi increase over time. 

&#x200B;

They have significant geographic exposure, a well established business that generates cash, and as least with finance / payroll systems, I would say Sage is a fairly default consideration for the entire SMB market. I think Sage has better branding than people give credit for. It's also a pretty stick product and can be cross-sold."
2021-05-09 18:29:03,stocks,"I think these are totally fair comments, thanks for them! 

&#x200B;

I'm also not without nerves regarding the 3D printing, and also about GWs strategy toward them. Agreed they will have to determine an approach here soon. My best case is hobbyists attach a premium toward the real deal, and GW works with skunkworx to license discontinued parts. 

&#x200B;

I'm not necessarily sure that GW is so sloppy with brand dilution as you though. If anything, I would say that they guard their IP extremely zealously, almost overly aggressively. That said, the company is very monetary focused, and you know, they are a company, they are there to make money, but you have to tread that line with not pissing people off. On the ""good"" side, because of the nature of 40K, a lot of records are lost and there's scope for significant ""reinterpretation"" through propaganda and etc! There are a ton of story lines I would like to see worked on, especially now Guilliman is back. I hear an ""Eisenhorn"" series is also being storyboarded for the inquisitor. 

&#x200B;

Another concern I have is that although they have, at times, engaged with the community, it's pretty poor still, just less shit than it was. Comments on videos not allowed, and although they are less ""I'll sue you"" happy, it's weird that they would take things like ""Astartes"" down from Youtube, when that seemed a great gateway. But community engagement could be so much better, and now they are a £3.5bn market cap company, you'd think they could hire a PR/media/engagement team really!"

2021-05-09 18:52:58,stocks,"I'm aware of those sources, and invest in several companies that don't pay a dividend, including 1 of the 11 where I referred to them as Buffett approach, so that should have been a giveaway I was aware of the approach. There is something to be said for not condescending when you've obviously overlooked/chosen to ignore readily available data in your reply, makes you look a tad silly and arrogant at best, ignorant at worst.

&#x200B;

Accepted that a dividend is a sign of a good company. There are other reasons though that you are seemingly not aware of, so let me educate you. For example, a company putting cash in my stock account can't be fudging the numbers compared to one that is, because earnings can be manipulated, but cash in my pocket can't (or is considerably harder to). There's also the argument that a Board having to consider investors more actively creates better management, they can't keep up with ""jam tomorrow"" arguments to explain a lack of results today.  There's also the data that shows dividend stocks are less volatile because they give a natural floor in the form of yield.

&#x200B;

You're focusing only on the mechanics of it. Yes, of course, a companies share price should be assets less liabilities, and so if they give out cash (reduce assets) it reduces the share price by the same amount. But a $ paid in dividend has a different value than a $ on the share price."

It is quite jarring to receive ads that don’t relate to you, or even each other. It snaps you out of the little bubble you’ve created for yourself. It might even be a bit unpleasant!

To even see the popups you have to be opted-in, it’s physically impossible to get the popup if you’re opted out.

Only if you’ve consciously opted-out by limiting ad tracking before the update are you technically being given the chance to opt-in (if you manually allow the popups again in settings), but the vast majority of users are already opted in by default.

Edit: another way to look at it is they’re not asking to get access to new data, they’re asking if you want to continue sharing the data they’ve already been tracking forever. You’re limiting the tracking that was already taking place. Hence opting-out."

Telco is only aware of data being set to brokerage server.  Then the Apple brokerage server could create a whole new “packet” and send it to the person you wanted to originally message via telco. But telco has no way to know it’s the same information being sent.  

The message going straight from A to B via telco routing exclusively without an inbetween certainly ruins the anonymity aspect. 

It’s entirely possible to create a setup like this. Hell add more brokerage servers and do some obfuscation of payload randomizing the size of what’s in there, routing, and do some intentional randomization of latency and you’re adding some good layers."

The synergy is not obvious, but the high price they're paying and the large stock dilution they're doing to cover it are.  Meanwhile NVDA's attempt to buy ARM is a win if they succeed and a win if they don't (they get to keep the cash and the arguments being made to prevent approval of the deal mean nobody else can try to buy ARM).

2021-05-08 23:26:40,stocks,"Let me tell you about my strategy.  I try to locate companies that are having fast revenue growth.  You can go to Fidelity and look at the holdings of any ETF.  That is a good starting point to locate good companies in various sectors.  Once you locate a company in a fund's portfolio, start studying the charts and financial statements.  Just focusing on the top line is fine.  Don't need to be a CFA.

Commission free trades has revolutionized the way I invest.  It allows me to be methodical about entering a position.  So say I find a company I like.  As long as it has not had a parabolic spike in recent weeks, start building a position.  Buy $100 a day until you have built a $300--$500 position.  If it keeps going up, pause, wait for it to fall a bit, then repeat.

Do this with many companies.  You should have a minimum of 100 companies in your portfolio.  Your aim should be to own the stocks for decades as the companies grow.

If you are looking for high growth names right now that are beat down at the moment - near their 52 week lows, and these are all in my portfolio, look at Teledoc, C3ai, Sumo Logic, Palantir, BigCommerce, Ncino, Alteryx, Door Dash, Context Logic, Snowflake, Coinbase, Fastly, Blue Prism, Fubo TV, Unity Software.    Some serious bargains there right now."
2021-05-08 23:43:01,stocks,"Best advice I can give is to lower how much you're putting in at a time. Less money involved means less emotions and less emotions just means clarity of thought.

It's hard for me to stop second guessing myself sometimes also. Just remember there is no such thing as a perfect portfolio and you will always want to make tweaks and changes. Just dont do anything in a rush and if the market allows it, sleep on all decisions. When you sleep your unconscious and conscious merge together in thought. You're less likely to second guess your decisions if you sleep on them. The market timing doesnt always allow this but it's a strategy that has helped me a lot."

The wife bought the bike and I tried it out to see what all the fuss with spinning was about - got hooked and even ordered their dumbbells. I will never return to the gym given the time saved and convenience of working out at home. 

This product will appeal to people who care just enough about fitness and value their time - i.e. people with above average household income.  Also if there are 2 or more people using the equipment or services you ended up saving money.

Also a lot of people don’t realize how fast spin classes get booked up at regular gyms. I’m sure people don’t want to deal with trying to register for a spin class.

PTON is in a growth phase - will continue to expand to other markets, they’re investing in R&D and I think they should be able to get their costs down over time as well. They are partnering with celebs (usher, usain bolt etc) too and I think over time it should get better."

It’s 20-40 year old upper income women mostly who want a purpose built machine to give them high quality on demand spin classes. Look up how much a flywheel class is. I think I’ve spent like $30 for a single spin class in nyc before. It’s not cheap, this machine makes it “cheap” to do as many spin classes when ever I want. 

Now peloton is vastly over valued as a company. They sell a damn bike with a screen, I don’t think that’s a $30bn company. That’s another discussion altogether.

your statement of paying less than unemployment shows how out of wake current payments are and your general understanding how the economy works.

if you go the way of the job shouldn't be there then well that person won't have a job. if you are physically fit and decent mental capacity you are going to have to do something to get resources for the collective or the collective will kick you out. people also generally don't like having to buy shit for people that could pay their own way but don't.

2021-05-09 06:29:53,stocks,">Is this a stupid decision?

The current anti-growth sentiment in the market is due to inflation fears. If inflation materialises long-term, then future earnings are worth less so growth suffers. The next two inflation reports (may 12th, jun 10th) will likely be bad, so your stocks might suffer a little more - but near September to October, inflation should calm down. Supply shortages should begin to relax and inflation in general should go down. 

All of that is to say, this is likely (near?) the bottom of the market for those stocks, and a good time to buy not sell. 

The only reason you should sell is if you think hyperinflation is coming to the US and will stay long term. Or, if you genuinely *need* the money for something else.

I would hold. What you do with your stocks is upto you.

If you still think these companies will bounce back, you can keep them and start a new position in something more stable and reliable (VTI for now while you learn).  Start putting all your new deposits into it. In 3-5 years you will have a decent position in a safe investment and who knows - maybe these guys will bounce back a bit.

I'm keeping CRSR for now though- I like the company and have actually used their products and they had stellar earnings.

Beyond Meat’s Beyond Sausage product sells for $10.30 a pound, about 70% more than comparable pork sausage.""

I know the article is from 2019 but I would venture a guess that the prices comparison is about the same today.
