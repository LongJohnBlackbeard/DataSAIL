2021-04-08 19:33:11,stocks,Yes. And I overpay a tiny amount so that I don‚Äôt get a surprise in April. Yeah... miss out on some return throughout a year but at least then I can be as aggressive as I want to be with my investments. I don‚Äôt touch money I will need in short term and taxes fall into that category. This way I can be 100% equity with the rest of it and not sweat having to sell at the bottom if things turn on me.
2021-04-08 19:49:07,stocks,"I generally try to sell my dud stocks that I've either lost or made low gains on whenever I need money, this helps contain capital gains. 

When I sell something that has made $$, I generally take like 30% out of whatever the gains I sold and make an expected tax payment on irs.gov. it sucks, but it makes it less painful in april."
2021-04-08 19:33:27,stocks,I pay taxes at the end of the year when they are due. But that‚Äôs Canada for you!
2021-04-08 19:54:05,stocks,I keep my capital gains in a high interest savings account as I go so they are on hand as I Go. My other taxes are set up to break even.
2021-04-08 19:52:25,stocks,Thanks for the info about online payment. I hate mailing stuff.
2021-04-08 19:53:19,stocks,"Same here. If I had to mail it, I probably wouldn't."
2021-04-08 19:30:41,stocks,"I am in on BYND, I intend to be in on this play aswell if their balance sheet checks out. 

The growth trajectory of the plant based diet globally is rather astonishing, and although the barrier to entry is quite low to start up these companies in my opinion, especially with the epic amount of SPACs floating around at the moment, I do think there is enough market to grow into with competition.

In fact, I think the competition will only exacerbate plant based diets by increasing the commonality of the product, and so increase demand and profits."
2021-04-08 19:33:04,stocks,"IPOD, IPOF and other spacs started moving as soon as the news came out."
2021-04-08 19:35:17,stocks,"They jumped from 150 stores to 20,000 stores last year. I like the product better than Beyond (I also own BYND). I think they both have a bright future, especially if the general public starts to pay attention to how bad the meat industry impacts the environment.

(I have shares through Equityzen at a 1.8B valuation)"
2021-04-08 19:29:18,stocks,Beyond meat tastes a lot better too
2021-04-08 19:41:34,stocks,You nice and lovely people can invest and eat all the plant burgers you want. Bon apetito... Leaves more beef. Real beef. Steaks. Prime rib. Chicken breasts. For the rest of us!!!! üçîüëçüôèüòÅ
2021-04-08 19:30:30,stocks,Plants have feelings too.
2021-04-08 19:33:00,stocks,"Agree on taste. 

I think both will end up doing pretty well since they seem to be the two front runner for this stuff."
2021-04-08 19:48:33,stocks,This post literally mentions the stock. Shhh
2021-04-08 19:30:47,stocks,"Definitely is not Motley Fool. I have a subscription and I enjoy it.  Lots of good pre set screeners, or you can customize one.

2021-04-08 18:56:11,stocks,So some analysts are bearish on it they think the stock will go down. Some analysts are bullish their saying it‚Äôs gonna go up so buy more or buy in. Hold just means there‚Äôs not gonna be any price action and if you‚Äôve already bought it just keep it because there‚Äôs no indicators towards buying or selling. A buy rating buy in if you haven‚Äôt and if you have just hold or even buy more
2021-04-08 19:00:55,stocks,"‚ÄúHold none‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean the 8 telling you to buy don‚Äôt also want you to hold. My understanding is they each only get one rating.

Consider it more like this:

Buy rating = Stock good

Hold rating = Stock neutral

Sell rating = Stock bad

And all these analysts only get to pick one. Or just consider ‚ÄúHold‚Äù to be implicit in someone‚Äôs advice to buy."
2021-04-08 19:01:06,stocks,this information is generally useless
2021-04-08 19:05:03,stocks,"I always took the hold rating to mean a more undecided analyst who isn't bullish enough to buy more but not bearish enough to sell, more waiting for news."
2021-04-08 19:00:13,stocks,"No analysts are saying hold, because all 8 of 8 analysts are saying it's a buy."
2021-04-08 19:00:08,stocks,"Thanks!

I just read that as them saying not to hold (0 recommended) implied they were telling who currently have it that they recommend against holding it.

But what you are saying makes sense where hold is basically ""pass"" meaning if you have it keep it and if you don't have it don't buy it."
2021-04-08 19:01:56,stocks,First of all I understand no analysts recommend holding which is the basis of the post.  Secondly there are 11 analysts.
2021-04-08 19:05:19,stocks,"Sorry. Skipped a bit. Either way, overperform is another term for buy here. Whatever service or company these 11 analysts are working for, they're using a 5-point metric. Buy/overperform-hold-sell/underperform. Not exactly sure which takes which place, but overperform is essentially another term for buy in this context."

2021-04-08 18:40:58,stocks,"It‚Äôs all about planning and being deliberate with your investment decisions. 

Have a timeline or event in mind when you buy. ‚ÄúI think company ABC is undervalued, and I‚Äôll give it three quarters of earnings to see if I‚Äôm right.‚Äù As long as no material changes happen to company ABC, such as an SEC investigation launches or a sink hole opens up under a critical piece of their infrastructure, you can ignore company ABC until the date you circle on your calendar. 

If it‚Äôs a set-and-forget like AAPL or MSFT, then set it. But the most important next part is, FORGET IT. 

If it‚Äôs a pennystock where you expect some sort of catalyst (drug trial results, fda approval, etc), have a timeline you‚Äôre looking for these things to happen. Ride or die until then.

If you are considering a stock but can‚Äôt put it into one of these three categories, don‚Äôt buy until you can."

2021-04-08 18:40:17,stocks,Think you just need to trade long enough to learn to control. Pick your targets and execute
2021-04-08 19:09:25,stocks,"The more losses you take the easier this will become. You‚Äôre going to learn naturally to take profits and cut losses.

If you want a strategy with hard numbers though? Put 50% in things like VTI and SPY, so that you can afford to be a little emotional with your individual plays without letting it wipe you out. 

If one of your stocks reaches 25% profit and looks to be at a peak, sell 50% of it or so to lock those profits in.

If a stock takes losses and looks like it will keep losing, cut your losses and if you want, buy back when you think it‚Äôs bottomed out. 

Do I follow this advice? No, because I am a stubborn idiot who has drank too much WSB flavored Kool-Aid. But I know it‚Äôs good advice because if I had followed it I‚Äôd be fairly well off right now."

2021-04-08 19:20:44,stocks,"Either invest in things like VTI where you‚Äôll never sell ever, or set up rules to take profit. Or, buy companies that you don‚Äôt intend to sell for decades and just add instead of trim over time."
2021-04-08 19:25:35,stocks,"Set yourself a take profit target and stick to it. The price may continue going up and you ask yourself why didn‚Äôt I just wait a bit longer? Does it really matter? Not really because you still made a profit from it. 

Of course we don‚Äôt know the specifics of what the investment is, but remember time in the market is better than timing the market."

2021-04-08 18:30:17,stocks,Just deploy capital regularly since no one knows what‚Äôs going to happen. Just stick to the plan you have and you‚Äôll be fine.
2021-04-08 18:49:14,stocks,"Just give it a few more months, or even a year. After you experience the ups and downs of the market, the FOMO shouldn‚Äôt be as bad. That said, you‚Äôll always have some level of FOMO for certain stocks, but it‚Äôll be less impactful on you with experience."

If I had done $119 strikes instead, I‚Äôd be up several thousand dollars right now.  Do I have FOMO? Nope. FOMO is emotional and you shouldn‚Äôt trade on emotions.  I made a mistake and I‚Äôll try to not make another one like it, but I was being conservative and that‚Äôs how I make money."
2021-04-08 19:55:24,stocks,"If it's any consolation, everyone thinks/knows the market is whack right now. Quantitative easing has pushed the market to insane values. With that said, two months ago you had the right judgement with the tech stocks, so maybe you can take consolation in that ARK funds, for instance, are still nowhere close to those highs.

Also, there will always be FOMO and I (as well as many others) paid a lot chasing FOMO. So if you start to disregard those notions and stick to investments you are confident with, it should work out more or less ok."
2021-04-08 18:29:04,stocks,Don't.   You know better as evidenced by you saying so!!!!
2021-04-08 18:31:35,stocks,I go back every 3 seconds!
2021-04-08 18:31:10,stocks,Actually good advice.  I put a ton in 1st quarter so it's time for me to go back to averaging.  Stick to the plan!
2021-04-08 18:53:22,stocks,Good advice!
2021-04-08 19:02:47,stocks,That's fair enough!
2021-04-08 18:28:29,stocks,This is the point we've come to.
2021-04-08 19:42:25,stocks,This is the way.
2021-04-08 18:30:27,stocks,"Yeah I probably won't.  Realistically what I can actually afford to put in in good conscience wouldn't even really change things all that much.

In lieu of me buying more stocks I have to scream and shout about it here."
2021-04-08 18:35:51,stocks,"The only one I‚Äôve shamelessly checked is GME. It‚Äôs recent movements haven‚Äôt left me FOMOing tho lol. That stock made me wildly emotional, unable to sleep... these are no good for trading!"
2021-04-08 18:43:52,stocks,"The market is a psychological and emotional arena. If you can compartmentalize your emotions and keep your head when shit either hits the fan or people are acting like the bull run will last forever, you‚Äôll come out ahead."
2021-04-08 18:43:48,stocks,"I'm relatively ""new"" to trading.  When I started I was fomoing all over and fucking shit up.  I taught myself how to read charts and got the fuck off of the stock boards for the next tip and things improved drastically for me.  I actually managed to mop back up what I lost by doing some day trading, which gave me a lot more confidence because I did it not trying to hit it big, but calm and rational.  

I do enjoy the boards, but treat them as pure fun and maybe an occasional shout out about a stock that is ripe for some trading.   99% of the knuckleheads on there shouting have no clue what is going on, and it is easy to get carried away with the feeling of excitement.   

Anyways, the most important thing I learned was to not blow out your buying power.   No matter how much you want more.   If shit goes south, you are dead in the water for a while and that isn't helping you at all if you see something else bubble up."
2021-04-08 19:07:43,stocks,I was in on the first round and sold it for a profit (not at the top) and I stopped following it because it was controlling my life.
2021-04-08 18:37:52,stocks,"I understand.  I bought on the way down the 1st time and was bummed that I (presumably) had taken a big loss.  Then read all the DD out there and was sure that it was going to moon.  Bought 2 more when it was low.  Couldn't take it anymore though, once it rocketed up again I sold all 3 of mine (on the way back down mind you).  It was a fun ride.  I ended up making some money off it."
2021-04-08 18:44:38,stocks,Also good advice.  Have you been investing for more than 2 months?
2021-04-08 18:45:25,stocks,Great advice.  I concur.
2021-04-08 18:51:08,stocks,Yeah it was fun ! I got in when it jumped from 40 to 120. Sold for just under double so I was relatively satisfied and ready to get back to being emotionally stable

2021-04-08 18:12:45,stocks,"No no. It is good for you. Your cost basis is artificially increased so when you sell it at some point you will not have to pay as much in taxes. Nothing changes from your perspective - you still have what you have. Just if you sell it at $8.78 you will show a loss... not a gain, so no taxes due. That‚Äôs to compensate you for not being able to deduct your loss from the initial sale."

Realistically though you point out good aspects of the situation. Most money is made on business travel.

Demand hasn‚Äôt completely rebounded yet so people are really betting on a perfect reopening. Whether you think that‚Äôs appropriate or not is up to you.

There is the possibility of a market melt down for QQQ that actually has occurred in the past and would be pretty much unrecoverable for TQQQ.

The Blue line represents QQQ

The Red line represents how TQQQ would have performed had TQQQ been around for the dot com crash.

If you want to still hold significant TQQQ but lessen the effects of this black swan event.  Do not go 100% in to TQQQ.  Maybe go 40-60% in to TQQQ and hold the rest in something uncorrelated or even just sit in cash that can repurchase shares when TQQQ crashes or rebalance after a given amount of time."

2021-04-08 18:33:29,stocks,Look up the lost decade. QQQ went down between 1999 and 2009. Are you fine with watching your account lose money for 10 years and what if you get laid off could you survive without withdrawing money from it? Now multiple those losses by 3.
2021-04-08 18:58:05,stocks,It is very good for short term moves to go in after a correction but long term I‚Äôd be hesitant to hold it.

2021-04-08 17:22:36,stocks,People want to avoid leveraged ETFs because of decay (10% up and down not even). My take is who cares with TQQQs returns - personally going to start a small position when I offload my cyclicals as a long term lottery ticket.
2021-04-08 15:46:53,stocks,"yeah if you believe we're in a strong bull market, no reason not to buy tqqq"
2021-04-08 19:40:51,stocks,"maybe someone can answer this about these kind of leveraged etfs, if they are designed to hold for a day who is buying at 15:55pm when you want to sell your shares?"
2021-04-08 19:14:45,stocks,That‚Äôs an incredible chart. TQQQ is certainly not a set and forget stock. It‚Äôs for gambling that the market will keep going up during short intervals.
2021-04-08 19:44:17,stocks,"Wouldn‚Äôt a simple stop loss remove most of this extreme downside risk? It‚Äôs not an unreasonable assumption that tech is never going to crater to nothing in a single day. You very likely could already be way up on a position before, let‚Äôs say, a 20% stop loss kicks in. Because of the nature of these leveraged funds being based on single day qqq performance, one could just recognize volatility is still high after their stop loss kicks in and choose to wait till it cools off before entering again.  It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre missing out on gains since tomorrow is only what matters on these funds.

After watching what happened to my leveraged position in spring 2020 and holding I plan to do this going forward. If the VIX is trending up and TQQQ is trending down I plan to sell my position and wait till TQQQ is trending up and the VIX has normalized. Trends coming from positive/negative weekly MACD values. I keep 20% of my Roth in UPRO/TQQQ. Probably due for a rebalance since it‚Äôs approaching 30% with all the gains even from starting in January 2020, but it‚Äôs hard not to be greedy üòÇ. Would love to see a back test using this method."
2021-04-08 18:27:55,stocks,"Let's say there's a crash and QQQ drops 30%. For QQQ to recover to its original price, it needs to gain about 43%. Let's say, for simplicity, even though this is incredibly unlikely, QQQ drops 30% in one day and gains 43% the next day. Now TQQQ drops 90% the first day and gains 129% the second day. The 129% gain sounds great, but it's on such a small number after the 90% loss that after the two days, QQQ is sitting at 100% of its original value, and TQQQ is sitting at a measly 22.9% of its original value üòû No good!

Every time there's a direction reversal in the index, the 3x leveraged index loses a little performance. Because the gains are always on a smaller number than the losses. Not so drastic as in the crash scenario. But you end up underperforming over time on average.

Actually, in a string of consecutive gaining days, the leveraged index does better than 3x. Say QQQ gains 5% two days in a row (using big numbers again to magnify effects). Then it's up 10.25% after two days. TQQQ gained 15% on each of those two days, and is up 32.25%. That's actually a little more than 3 times 10.25%! But on average, in the real world markets, the underperformance from changing direction tends to dwarf the overperformance from consecutive green days."
2021-04-08 16:43:18,stocks,"your comment makes no sense. if op believes we're in the beginning of another bull market led by tech, tqqq and similar tech 3x etfs are absolutely the best vehicle for it (assuming no options). if you disagree, please name another stock that has performed better."
2021-04-08 19:53:36,stocks,"I mean, stop losses also assumes your timings will be good.  Meaning, it won't hit your stop ever and start pumping back up, which would leave you in the dust.  There has been many times where the market is crashing hard, but some crashes harder and longer than others.  Your stop loss timing can also be super unfortunate depending on how the market behaves."
2021-04-08 19:41:50,stocks,Not OP but thanks for the ELI5! It's helpful!
2021-04-08 17:10:37,stocks,"My comment is trying to say that those are two major assumptions to be making in order to try and justify using 3x etf when OP already recognizes the inherent risks of doing so. Whatever OP thinks or you think the market is going to do is practically irrelevant, same with my opinion because no one has a clue what‚Äôs going to occur. So if he wants to take a stand and bet on it, sure, but I‚Äôm trying to show his statement is hinging on making two major assumptions about future market conditions."

There's jitters the USA will ban cheap Chinese solar but people are missing that China has announced their going to target a lower gdp growth number to focus on quality of growth. I.e. cleaning up their awful air. To replace coal they will need a shit ton of renewables, other countries in the region like India will need to do the same. Plus as solar becomes the cheapest power source demand will ramp up regardless of environmental concerns.

Short of China collapsing or the government nationalising Jinko I just don't see a situation where they don't have explosive growth in the next decade. Nobody is operating at their scale, production is too complex for lesser developed countries like Vietnam to compete. The market demand is about to grow 20x+ and they're the cheapest option and largest supplier."

Generally, dividend payers with reasonable valuations are going to be a better bet if you are looking for something with limited downside than a Tesla or another high multiple stock.

Personally, I like midstream pipeline companies (just bought some EPD and ENB today) and REITs (been buying a bunch of these in my Roth IRA), but you gotta do your own research and decide what you are comfortable with. My goal is to build a passive income stream, but there are other good picks as well. It‚Äôs not a dividend payer, but maybe the safest stock I can think of is Berkshire Hathaway.

That -50% has happened, it's done. Selling it and forgetting the shame/ deleting the big red numbers on the screen doesn't help you in any way in of itself. I might have grabbed the wrong end of the stick hear so apologies if that's so but you have to get over it and look unemotionally at the future moves if you are to learn from it.
For instance, personally I've been adding most to positions I have which are currently -40 and -60% because I still love what they're trying to do and they've just been hammered by wider market moves. I probably bought a little expensive admittedly but I believe the price is so good that I get a great opportunity to buy lots more. However there have been multiple others where I've gone 'yup that was dumb, I got suckered in to the hype/rally/gains/herd' and I've had to admit I was stupid and try to regain composure and perspective.

 To actually (not) answer your question instead of blithering on... 
Quick and simple test. Imagine you have no history with the stock, forget it ever existed. Now re evaluate it fresh based on your current metrics/ it's current outlook. Does it look like good value at the price it currently is with all the potential/ risk that is has?
Your risk profile is yours alone, there are as many answers to 'individual stock or broad based etf?' as there are investors. Truth is you can't make it a binary question so try not to. Broadbase ETFs are never going to be the wrong choice, by definition they are the safest exposure to pure securities. They just might not be THE best choice. Perhaps reduce the position, sell 25\50% or some portion now to appease yourself and move it if that makes you feel more comfortable and able to feel confident again. Then look again in the coming weeks or months."

[Portfolio performance vs net investment](https://imgur.com/ptS1C6k)

I was mostly throwing money into ETFs and mutual funds prior to 2017 at which time I started getting a little more serious about investing.

At my peak (last December timeframe), there were nearly 100 different investments spread across several different accounts. I do have a 'robo advisor' account which buys and sells a bunch of Schwab ETFs, gold, etc and there are about 15 different investments in that account alone.

Since December I've consolidated a lot and have cut that number down significantly.  As you can see by the above chart, my portfolio balance has done pretty well.

My investment strategy was a mix of investing in what I know / believe in (tech, green energy) as well as doing research on companies I found via Reddit and other investment websites. I'm also a long term holder.  I don't really buy anything with less than a 5 year sell timeframe.

I feel like finding valid companies now via websites/reddit is a lot harder than it was pre-GME.  Now everyone is trying to pump a bunch of crap and it's really hard to sift through to find the hidden gems.

Do I advocate having a ton of investments?  No.  Has it worked well enough for me? Yeah."

2021-04-08 16:15:29,stocks,"Just counted. I have 44 stocks and the rest are a mix index funds and etfs mainly in various retirement accounts.

It was 15 until pandemic fears started getting worry some + sector ETFs & country ETFs and these were positions I bought and added to over the prior decade and are multibaggers. I got rid of a few stocks in the first few weeks of Feb as they looked very susceptible to systemic issues from the pandemic so I had a total of 23 stocks. Sold out of all ETFs by the first week of March.

I start new positions and kept buying in a bunch of companies on my watchlist that I had high long term conviction for when they hit multi year lows from March to May and a few more add-on since then. Were too juicy to not buy even if they overlapped in sectors. 

The most recent four new positions were when I didn't know what to do with excess cash I use as an emergency fund (yes, yes, I know it should be in cash but our house hold has high income & 
a large portfolio in taxable brokerages that we can liquidate at anytime. I just keep one month's cash). These companies looked very attractive based on various factors and offered high dividends due to pandemic fears and underperformance. I have new money coming in every week through my paycheck and part of it already goes into index funds (retirement accounts) so what do you do with the excel cash when the market seems overvalued (yes, in hindsight, market didn't peak). So you go for what looks beaten up for the short term but undervalued in the long term. 

Other than adding to existing positions, 

Various buys of Exxon Mobil (XOM) & Phillips 66 (PSX) from Aug to Oct as they were heading towards march lows. I will sell these after the one year mark and also depending on what the oil market looks like. 


Walgreens (WBA) on 09/14/2020 as it looked like good value for the price. I seemed to have got this close to a multiyear bottom. So I probably won't exit unless something fundamentally changes about the company. 

Gilead Sciences (GILD): bought on 12/24/2020 - seemed to bounce off under 60 every time. Will reevaluate at some point.

I don't keep ""up-to-date"" with them. I haven't had to do all that after my initial research and adding them to my watchlist. I don't do a lot of indepth super deep 4d under water research. I just follow simple metrics, read some analyst write ups  and make sure they don't have any systemic problems that affect them in the long term. If they have a bad post-earnings event or a macro-sector event causes them to crash due to market overreaction but not affect long term prospects, I might add more after taking a second look. 

I seemed to have gotten some of these companies at amazing prices last year with some already doubling and tripling so I see no reason for selling any time soon except at some point, the previous four I listed. What would I do with the cash anyway."

Being new to the world of investing, I keep discovering new companies that interest me. These mainly involve tech and semiconductors, so I felt the need to round out my portfolio with other sectors (consumer staples, industrial, etc). This pattern has led me to where I am now.

I feel safer, but like others have said, I'm likely not beating the market average. The money I use would otherwise be sitting in a savings account, and I enjoy picking stocks (as opposed to ETFs/index funds). As long as I'm growing, I guess it's fine with me.

2021-04-08 17:03:35,stocks,"I currently have 48 stocks but it's across 4 portfolios:

My personal ISA: UK focused, mining, oil, tech weighting

My wife's ISA: US focused, utilities, pharma, financials, recreational weighting

My non-ISA shares: recovery stocks, SPACs and politically sensitive, higher risk

My wife's non-ISA shares: speculative / unproven businesses

My plan over the long term is to have \~15 in each ISA and then a few gambles as and when.

Reasons for not using ETFs is I had a few in the beginning and I was outperforming them, you have management fees, and I wanted to familiarise myself with stocks. I like the idea of owning part of a business, and an ETF just seems a step divorced from that. I also think it's more fun, I'd accept a slightly lower return for more enjoyment (I compare myself to indexes often, I am smashing the FTSE all-share by almost 50% but am underperforming the S&P by about 10%, though I am catching up as I fix mistakes). Lastly, ETFs are indexed by region, or sector, or type, but I just wanted a blend of shares. If I want to mix ¬£GAW and $EPD, maybe with some ¬£BAE and $BMY, why can't I?"

you know ETF's aren't free, right? and likewise, an ETF isn't necessarily going to invest in the same companies at the same ratios that a person would want.

there's literally nothing wrong with owning more than 30 companies. yes, i say this as someone with 20 companies in my portfolio (including smaller holdings), but if someone wants more than that, more power to them.

someone's core holdings likely aren't going to be over 30 companies, but if someone wants to set up a core holding and then sprinkle some cash into a few dozen more companies beyond that which they feel could 3x in the next few years, why not? that's a better approach than people YOLOing on meme stocks. there's not wrong with having a solid core, and then having like 10% of a portfolio dedicated to a pool of high risk/high reward companies."
2021-04-08 18:30:34,stocks,"Having been in investment banking for decades, I've seen it all.  It started with formal education that preached that asset allocation was everything.  I've come to learn that was BS, with studies and axioms propped up by institutional marketing motivations and outdated belief systems.

I was also trained that mutual funds were the way to go because only the vaunted fund managers had the information and intelligence to make the right moves.  I eventually learned that too was false marketing mystique.  I saw mutual funds owning obvious (to me) garbage, and missing out on obvious quality.  I saw their transacting was not geared for portfolio performance, but unit sales.  I saw this over and over and over and over.  It took me far too long to wise up and reject this though, because the formal education and conventional wisdom were so powerful.

I gradually became an active equity investor, doing enormous amounts of diligence and only making actual transactions when I was 200000% confident.  I eventually learned that's too conservative, and too time consuming.  I learned I didn't have to find that ""hold for life"" perfect unicorn, because it's not necessary, and doesn't exist.  

I eveolved to a philosophy of having a small but diversified set of holdings.  From that I learned that sometimes being 95% right isn't good enough, because I'd have all the aspects of a call correct, from the timing and direction and market and macro, but the one stock I did pick might be the one with some isolated exogenous situation.  In other words, a given sector I'd made an astute call on the year before would do very well, but I'd miss out because the one company I chose was the one that didn't participate.  Or I'd find my diversification would create offsetting pairs, where what I'd make on A would be lost on B. 

One of the biggest and most valuable insights was that ""buy and hold"" is the retail finance industry's biggest scam of all, along with the similarly false slogans like ""you can't time the market"" and to a lesser extent, the broad misunderstanding of DCA.

I've come to realize the impact of emotions affecting transactions.  Much can be said about that, but most relevant to your question is that I was tired of the emotional deflation that came from seeing explosive pops in stocks that I knew about, considered, and then missed, because they weren't good enough to include in my top 5 (or whatever). 

I learned to participate in a larger number of positions because it's more engaging, and more profitable.  Owning many positions means there's always something to watch, to look forward to, an earnings call, an investors day, a product launch.  Even negative events are still engaging. 

Having many positions also means I have lots of choices on days when I need to raise cash or deploy capital.  In the past, if I had just 5 ""best of breed"", there were lots of times where none of the 5 were advantageous to sell.  With, in your example, 40, there probably at least one or two of the 40 that's overbought or above its expected cycle and which can be tapped for cash to scoop up something that's clearly oversold.  

I believe that every single position should be researched and watched every day, and I do that.  Buy and homework, never buy and hold.  I journal all day, every day that market is open, and I write down plans and strategies when it's closed.  I record my emotions and predictions even if they don't materialize into transactions, then I go back and see how those would or wouldn't have played out.  I also record and then back test various analysts and pundits.  I would not recommend someone blindly holding 50 positions, otherwise they'd be better in an ETF.

My portfolio is like an ETF, but it lets me filter out what I consider to be wrong choices, and add some that I think the ETF manager is missing.  It's like an enhanced ETF, if you will.  Make no mistake, it requires discipline and effort, but if someone is willing to put in the work, it's the best way to go."

Plus some tiny allocations to few speculative, all or nothing micro caps. And of course I just have a lot of money in ETFs. All-World, World Small Cap, Emerging Markets. You got to have those. At the end of the day it all adds up to about 70 but it's not like I have to constantly follow 70 companies.

My rationale for having so many stocks is simple. It doesn't take a lot for your overall portfolio to outperform -- just one or two stocks that make up, say, 3 percent of your portfolio doubling over the course of the year means a 3 percent gain on your portfolio even if all of your other stocks didn't move at all. Also, I have FOMO and want to own ALL the stocks and not miss out on possible metoeric rise. This addresses that for sure. It also spreads out risk. And some will make that wild move up over time -- let your runners run, and cut your losers early!

When I see stocks I like go on sale, I sell off the more stable ones and buy those more speculative ones. Ths is similar to what the ARK funds did in the recent selloff in growth stocks"

I can't give up those companies cause I love them too much but still need to diversify, so I just spread it quite thin"
2021-04-08 19:05:40,stocks,"Because i just like the stocks. I find a new stock that i like, i look into it, if the buy makes sense, i buy and hold forever. When i don't have any new stock i am excited about, i just look at the ones i already own and see which one is the best value at the moment and i increase my position in that one. If none seems to be a good value, i just buy an index. Some years i add 5-10 individual stocks to my portfolio and other years i only do indexes or just increase my positions. Over time it is easy to accumulate even over 50 very solid stocks in a portfolio. And that is only stocks that i personally feel excited about. And i don't even invest in stocks that would be solid and good value but i don't identify with their business on a personal level. If i didn't have this constraint, i feel like even 100 individual companies could be doable."
2021-04-08 19:11:02,stocks,"I don‚Äôt have that high a number, like 10 ish,
I have the ones for dividends pep and mxlp (or something it‚Äôs an oil company with 10% dividends)
Then I have the basic apple, Tesla, and less common virgin galactic, (I wanted a space stock and Revolut/ nyse don‚Äôt have any really) 
And then I have a couple companies that I think will probably increase but aren‚Äôt doing great right now mainly GoPro, they are a standard in so many industries and hobbies I find it hard to believe they will flop anytime soon"
2021-04-08 19:15:45,stocks,"Even a portfolio of 50 stocks, while most people would agree is probably pretty diversified (unless they were all variants of the same companies or industries), will not be nearly as diverse as a total market ETF or one that follows the S&P. Relative to a basket of hundreds or even thousands of companies, 50 is but a sample. One could argue that, with enough luck and skill, your own personal basket of 50 companies that you feel are most primed to do well will outperform or at least do as well as the market, cycling positions as things change over time. Of course, outperforming is apparently very difficult to do over a long time. So then why bother otherwise? Well, perhaps it's fun to pick out companies that you think will do well, and see what happens. Or perhaps you just really want to invest in a company out of goodwill, profits be damned."
2021-04-08 19:25:54,stocks,I have had up to 90 different stocks got them down to bout 50 now
2021-04-08 19:28:06,stocks,Because it‚Äôs fun duhhh lol
2021-04-08 19:28:34,stocks,"My watchlist is far too big, but I eventually wanna invest in these companies. I just don't have money yet"
2021-04-08 19:40:04,stocks,"Simply, some stocks outperform their competitors in their fields and beat the market, so if you're widely spread out across various sectors and want to outperform ETFs and various indexes, you want to keep pulling money out of losers and feed funds back into the highest earners. Plus, you have a list of cheap speculative plays across the board, because some will fail dramatically and a few will pay off in major ways."
2021-04-08 19:52:13,stocks,"Last year I had this many stocks and quite honestly I felt fine with the mental load of it. Now that the stock market isn't so easy any longer I need to do real research on stocks before I make a move as it seems easier to get burned. 
I'm new to this as well so I've learnt the lessons from having too many."
2021-04-08 19:54:19,stocks,"I want to sell a few, but I don't want to pay if I make a profit.  I can't transfer to an IRA."
2021-04-08 19:58:51,stocks,You can put a lot stock tickers on a dartboard.
2021-04-08 17:24:24,stocks,I try to have no more then 15 - diversification sucks if you know what you're doing and want firm specific risk.
2021-04-08 16:15:52,stocks,Just hold what Buffet holds in the same ratios. Or just YOLO BRK.A.
2021-04-08 19:48:22,stocks,"Congratulations, you've just built an ETF."
2021-04-08 18:27:51,stocks,You‚Äôve described me perfectly. I just love new investing ideas and hate adding the idea of averaging up (even though I know it‚Äôs statistically better than averaging down) because I feel like it‚Äôs cutting into my gains.
2021-04-08 15:46:48,stocks,"I was like this at first, had around 22 expecting a push here and a pump there. Basically I‚Äôve reduced my holdings to 12, and then any new ones have my utmost confidence ( recently entered innoviz and ipoe). I‚Äôve just been accumulating in the ones in kept."

2021-04-08 19:22:23,stocks,So 3% dividend yield?

2021-04-08 16:09:01,stocks,how many stocks you have then?
2021-04-08 18:45:23,stocks,"You are giving yourself too much credit, that recent bump in value is mostly due to stimulus, everyone did well there"
2021-04-08 16:33:02,stocks,Like my mom and her desktop covered in icons!
2021-04-08 17:05:38,stocks,"Hmm... that is an option to be fair, personally I don‚Äôt like it as I always consider analyst recommendations/online DD etc as just the starting point/source for getting investment ideas, if I then do my own research and think I don‚Äôt particularly like the stock/agree with the bull case then I won‚Äôt go in.

That‚Äôs just my personal approach though (others may disagree) - but if I buy a stock and it immediately tanks 20%, if I don‚Äôt fully understand the rationale for investing in the first place, I‚Äôll be tempted to panic sell. Whereas if it‚Äôs a company where I have a lot of conviction, a dip could be an opportunity to buy more and hold for the recovery. Either way it‚Äôs fully on me at the end of the day, and that‚Äôs just how I like it. Just IMHO though"
2021-04-08 17:10:35,stocks,"Yeah tbh if you enjoy stock picking and doing your research then by all means go for it. I really enjoy it too - stockpicking/reading up on DD/going through presentations on the company‚Äôs investor site, but personally I would find more than 10-12 companies difficult to stay on top of regularly. Whatever works for you though man - as long as you‚Äôre investing in companies you believe/have high conviction in, and can stay on top of them all - then by all means go for it"
2021-04-08 16:47:15,stocks,"Nothing wrong with holding an ETF. It's just being a realist and I respect that.

I sometimes ask myself if I am the one that needs the reality check thinking I can beat the market. I have been during my short investing period of 2.5 years, but you know what they say ""everyone is a genius in a bull market""."
2021-04-08 17:51:43,stocks,"I sold a few of my shares and just bought an ETF. Just didn‚Äôt want to devote as much time to research and I get impatient waiting for the obscure ones to take off. 

I may start buying individuals again when I‚Äôve got spare time and a bit more patience."
2021-04-08 16:53:51,stocks,The best strategy.
2021-04-08 18:23:53,stocks,Agreed better of to have ETF to secure $$$ and be less volatile so you can focus more on individual trades
2021-04-08 19:39:45,stocks,"Thanks for the confirmation bias. I just want to add an example of an ETF that I like (ICLN) that keeps PLUG as one of its holdings. I believed PLUG is barely more than a scam even before they had to restate financials. So, I am holding ICLN but also shorting PLUG since $45. That's already two positions right there. A couple more deeply held and researched theses in different sectors and you are already at 20 or more holdings."
2021-04-08 19:46:53,stocks,"100%. Diversification = mediocrity and is for those people who aren‚Äôt going to put in the research or don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre doing in both cases just go with an index or etf. People who put in a lot of work, have some sort of edge, and know what they‚Äôre buying for a good price don‚Äôt need more than 4-5 holdings or no more than 10 for ‚Äúdiversification‚Äù"
2021-04-08 16:52:11,stocks,"This is what I think as well. While my portfolio overall is outperforming, there are some laggards I feel I should cut out. I was listening to a podcast the other day saying how you should invest in your highest conviction stocks if you want growth, and diversify if you want protection. 

What really got me thinking was: ""High conviction picks are those that you think are the 'best idea(s)', it's hard to believe you have 50 best ideas"". It made me reflect on my position size of even 12 stocks and I asked myself, ""Do I really have 12 best ideas?""."
2021-04-08 15:36:48,stocks,I still play etfs üòÉ
2021-04-08 17:13:41,stocks,"Not disagreeing with you here, but one thing to point out is that‚Äôs pretty time-intensive - I really enjoy stock picking and managing my portfolio, but tracking daily movements of 50 companies will take up a lot of time (which many people may not want to do understandably)"

2021-04-08 17:20:50,stocks,"With content becoming more and more spread out across streaming services and thus requiring people to subscribe to more and more streaming services if they want to have access to all of their favorites, I continue to wonder if it will get to the point where most people just get fed up with it and start buying the movies and shows that they want again instead of having to maintain so many subscriptions.

I already do this and it is so much cheaper to just buy the stuff that I'm interested in one time rather than continually paying multiple streaming services. If I went the streaming route, I would have to subscribe to at least 5 different streaming services to get just about half of my favorites and that still wouldn't even give me access to the other half of my favorites.

I imagine it is a similar situation for most people so will it ever get to the point where most people have had enough of their favorite content being spread across too many different services and realize that it would be cheaper to just buy the content that really interests them and not have to worry about what service is their favorite content on this month anymore?"

The first three it‚Äôs understandable, but the last one has been out for way less time. 

Still much better than Paramount+ though, and that‚Äôs coming from someone holding a ton of Viacom at a loss because of how much potential I thought (and still think) that service would have."

I don't think this will push that many people into pirating and streaming like cable did.    Like don't get me wrong, I pirate most new movies and such that don't come out on these streaming services, but I think we are vastly over estimating the amount of people who use these services that would switch to just pirating everything."
2021-04-08 15:31:44,stocks,"I agree. I feel too late to be comfortable jumping into netflix stock, but they're very good at their product and I hope they stay relevant for a long time.

Competition hurt them in the beginning, but with paramount plus and new streams coming every day, these apps are going to be stuck with only being able to survive on original programming, and in a way I think that actually helps Netflix and the deals they've been able to pull off."

2. My finances became settled, my wife and I started making more money, had some extra income beyond normal savings, pension fund contributions, college savings plan for kids, etc.

3. Yes - I don‚Äôt actively trade regularly - but I check frequently just to see news about stocks I‚Äôm in.

4. Invest in what you know - you should be able to explain in three sentences what a company does and why you‚Äôre invested. Start small - watch and see how things work. Index funds and ETFs are a good starting point while you‚Äôre learning. 

5. Various reasons - mostly in large cap stable stocks. BA, WFC, AAPL, TGT, DIS, etc. I know it‚Äôs not likely to 10x my money, but just looking for consistent growth over long period (30 years)

6. Marijuana, alternative energy, and bioscience/pharma, fintech.

7. Stocks they can‚Äôt explain what the company does. Penny stocks are basically gambling. 

8. Month too small of a window to have any clue what they‚Äôll look like. 

9. Of course - but just basics like bought too high (what I thought was a dip, but it dipped more), sold with meat on the bone, etc. - but I haven‚Äôt made any like I bought 1,000 shares when I wanted to buy 100 shares.

10. Nothing - unless something has drastically changed about the company. If AAPL dives 10% in a week - I‚Äôm not selling. If I have free cash - I might buy more. 

11. Property. Precious metals. Art. Most of those are beyond most normal people aside from the house they own."

2. Girlfriend broke up with me, wanted to make her regret it
3. Yes but I short sell most of the time
4. Start investing in companies you use in your life, but at the same time if you are young invest in a penny stock and a few other ‚ÄúWhat If‚Äù tech stocks. This helps you understand how the market works and you‚Äôll appreciate the value of a dollar more
5. I did my research, sat on my computer a lot and just watched the candles do their thing. For shorting I see what‚Äôs being talked about a lot and also use stock screeners to find breakouts
6. Drone Industry and EV
7. Any Pharma stocks and Penny Stocks (after your initial investment into a penny stock as I stated in an earlier answer)
8. My one penny stock AITX is going to explode and be in the dollar range by the end of 2022, my drone stocks will do well besides EHang which I‚Äôm holding till 2022 Olympics then immediately dumping, I love shorting and what I wanna short is to be determined. Any profit I make from shorting generally goes to ETF‚Äôs 
9. I invested based off of friend‚Äôs DD rather than doing my own. I also lost some money on AMC trying to ‚Äúfit in.‚Äù Word of advice if WSB says do one thing, you do the opposite!
10. I would buy more shares if I believe in the company and I would hold if I have no additional funds. I have faith in my stocks and my short selling will more likely cover any losses I incur. 
10. People should really consider real estate or ETF‚Äôs if you want to invest but don‚Äôt like having to make your portfolio (doesn‚Äôt make sense to me but that‚Äôs just my opinion). I don‚Äôt think people are aware of these I think people focus too much on spending on physical products that bring them short-term satisfaction rather than long-term intangible wealth
Additional Comment: Invest as soon as you can! As soon as I started I stopped ordering food, i truly understood the value of a dollar, I live a poor lifestyle even though I‚Äôm relatively wealthy, and I have started finding hobbies to increase my wealth!"
2021-04-08 14:57:54,stocks,"Hey! For the record, I'm only 18 years, been learning about stocks and the market for about 3 months, so I even though I won't be able to provide the same advice as someone with experience would, I think a couple of things I know could help you!

&#x200B;

1. Started investing at 18
2. I have always been interested in financial related things, and I was always very careful with the way I spent money. So, as soon as I turned 18, wanted to learn how to make my money work for me
3. Yes still investing lol
4. If you're looking to invest: I recommend you don't for at least a few feeks / months (assuming you know nothing about the market and haven't done proper research. Especially with the recent instable market, don't jump in now. You might miss out on some profits, but you could also lose big. So learn what are stocks, etf, ctfs, mutual funds, try to learn the meaning of words (PE ratio, payout ratio, CAGR, etc.), then you will able to learn about specific companies / funds. Also, try understand the benefits of different investing strategies : Dividend growth investing (DGI), 3 fund investing, growth investing, etc. That will help you decide which type of investor you are and the reasons why you should stick to a SPECIFIC plan.
5. I haven't bought many things as of today, but I plan on doing that, and some factors influence me a lot. I'm canadian, so I try to limit the amount of US / World currency forex fees. Of course I can't buy Visa without exchanging currencies, but I try to find canadian ETFs tracking the US market or world market. Also, I know that I want to hold specific companies, and follow what's happening in their business. I don't want to passive invest in a mutual fund my whole life. So although I love some ETFs (SMH: Semi Conductors, VUN: Canadian equivalent of VTI, etc) I want to allocate a part of my portfolio to stock picking.
6. No idea tbh. Haven't done research on emerging market.
7. Speculative stocks. For example, many stocks in the EV / Green sector. I'm not against the green movement, I'm just against betting with no fundamentals. Yes, a certain company in the clean energy sector could be the next Chevron (CVX). But the chance of that happening is small, and I would much rather have lower returns than literally gambling my money. I think investing in Visa, Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple is wiser than investing in already-over-valued companies.
8. Honestly, if financial analysts can't even properly predict that, no one on this subreddit can. But, in my newbie opinion, I think markets will trade sideways for a while. i don't expect a crash with all the printing / support that the American market receives, but a growth like the past year isn't sustainable.  But people have no reason atm with Covid to remove money from the market, so I don't see why it would crash.
9. If I have made a mistake? Going to early in the market. I bought some ARKG-ARKQ stocks a week or two after the initial correction in march, because I thought they were crazy cheap. Turns out that I dont even want to hold them anymore. Not because of the 5-10% loss, but only because these ETFs do not fit my investing mind and strategy. I chased performance and regretted it because I hold something I don't even like.  Also, although people say 'time in the market is more important than timing the market', don't listen to it when you're learning. Its a valuable strategy if you know what you're doing and following a specific strategy, but don't go all in right now, without enough information, just because you don't wanna miss out on some gains.
10. I would hold if my stocks were declining, depending on the reason. If I think the future of the company isn't at risk, I will hold. There's a reason why I bought the stock to begin with, and it's because I thought it had real future value, so I'm not going to sell because of a correction  (even 15%+ in price). Would I be anxious? Probably. But trading out of fear isn't going to resolve the problem : I still lost money. So before considering selling, I will try to see if my initial reason for investing still stand. If they do stand, then I hold.
11. Well, of course people know about stocks, ETFs, CTFs, mutual funds and the stock market in general. But, I invested some play money in crypto currency for a few reasons. I want to learn how it works, how it can be used, and why is it so popular. I understand, crypto is considered risky af and based on nothing as of today, but maybe that in the future, it will play a bigger role in our life, so I would much rather learn today than tomorrow. Also, you can invest in real estate, in YOURSELF (knowledge, fun, etc.). I dont know much about real estate though, so can't really elaborate. But I think enjoying my life is as important as having a good financial situation, so I won't drop my hobbies and the activities I love for the sake of increasing my networth. I limit my spendings on short-term benefits that aren't really useful, but still spend on what I love (family, girlfriend, etc.)."

2. I grew up in poverty with an alcoholic father. We always had money issues. So it‚Äôs my goal to have financial freedom, to be able to care for my family, when the time comes. In the UK we have a Roth IRA called a LISA which gives you ¬£1 for every ¬£4 you invest. So each year I invest ¬£4K and you get a government bonus of ¬£1K. 

3. Yes

4. If this is your first time investing, I recommend you start investing in an S&P 500 index. It‚Äôs pretty safe and the fees are usually quite low.

5. Personally I like to invest in things that I use everyday. Like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla etc... Recently I‚Äôve been using the website ‚ÄòSimply Wall St‚Äô for ideas.

6. I think the next big thing in 5/10 years is Artificial Intelligence. Like imagine an app that can detect medical conditions, that could significantly change the American Health system by removing a lot of administration.

7. Penny Stocks, lots of people just pump and dump them.

8. By next year I‚Äôd expect between a 11% and 20% return.

9. When I was starting out, I panicked sold an index. Ended up buying it again for a cheaper price and it‚Äôs been one of my best investments. Happy accident I guess haha.

10. Have a stop loss set up, so you‚Äôre able to cut your loses where needed.

11. Yes, I had a crypto investment. I‚Äôve sold this for a profit, since that market is far too volatile. Also used to own some crypto kitties."

2021-04-08 13:55:04,stocks,If you are investing for long term just buy. If you do it with small steps as the others mentioned your transaction costs will be a big cost factor assuming you do not have a big amount of money.

     @ might you want to bail if the price goes below a certain price?, 
      @ at what price would you be happy with gains if it rose to that price, when your buy limit order hits set a sell limit order for your target price
- and now the hard part: sit back and wait, don‚Äôt micromanage, don‚Äôt look at the price all the time,
- adjust plan if/as/when new information becomes available (ie new company announcements, new rival news, etc.)"

2021-04-08 00:00:00,stocks,"What are your thoughts on EV charging? Too much, too early? Hi all,

Looking at Chargepoint and Blink charging.  They've had insane runups the past year.  My understanding is that it wasn't anything these companies did, but they just happened to be EV charging companies right as Biden took presidency and legislation started to get written in for EV.  They're just riding the wave.  I feel like people are just rushing into these charging stocks based on the sector alone and not the company.  Both have very high short interest.

For ex, Blink charging - How are they worth 2bil?  According to yahoo finance their total revenue in 2020 was 6.23 million.  Although it's significant growth from the year before, they're unprofitable and are in a business with thin margins.  Although there's the infrastructure bill, there's no news as to whether Blink has actually been offered government contracts, and that larger competitors will get them instead.  The culper research report didn't help either.

However, blink is in the right space and is an early player in the booming space.  What are your thoughts?  Is this an EV charging bubble just like weed stocks not too long ago?  What will be the catalyst to bring things back down?  Could these companies actually ever somehow justify their valuations?

Thanks!"

2021-04-08 11:52:08,stocks,"Once EVs really hit market significance, the vast vast vast majority of EVs will be charged at home 95% of the time, only getting charging while out on rare occasions. I'm kind of viewing charging companies like those internet phone booths that started to show up in the late 90s only to fall into complete obsolescence when smart phones came out, they're right about the future but wrong about how it's going to be implemented. (Obviously there will be a niche for charging stations though)"
2021-04-08 14:02:41,stocks,"trendy, over-hyped, and people's expectations are too high IMO. like EV-related stocks in general. the EV stuff can verge on Utopian IMO. I get suspicious whenever anyone says ""this will change everything!!!!"" I've heard too many failed world-changing predictions to get my hopes up on the next one. 

for example: there's a lawsuit pending against Workhorse for supposedly misleading investors about the USPS contract. the USPS came out and said it was crazy expensive to switch to electric  vehicles for their fleet. ... what does that say about adding millions of EVs across the nation? 

I'm also a little skeptical about widespread implementation of EVs in colder areas of the nation. EVs lose up to 50% of their power in cold temps. so the car loses 50% of its range, the batteries wear out faster, and users need to charge it 2x as much as in a warmer climate. extrapolate this to high-population places like Chicago, which can be brutally cold for half the year. I think the estimates for building out the electric grid are far too optimistic. consider what happened in Texas with the recent severe storms. what happens when large areas of the country don't have electric power for houses AND for EVs? California can't supply their own electricity NOW and are buying from coal/natural fired plants in Arizona or Nevada ... what's gonna happen when everyone's plugging an EV into the grid in addition to existing electric usage?"

Yes long journeys will require charging stations, which is why I said they'll still have a niche, but how many times in a year do people take journeys longer than their EV battery life? And that battery life is only going to get longer as time goes on.

2021-04-08 00:00:00,stocks,"A rare bullish DD for PLUG, & Hydrogen in general I wrote this originally as a comment, but it got upvotes relatively quickly, so I think I'll make a DD on this. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm bullish on it.

I think hydrogen has a better future than EV. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future, the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. I have my eyes on $APD, personally I think thats a good long term bet, but PLUG is one of them more riskier plays. With their creation of Hydrogen plants, plus one of the biggest hydrogen plants in the US, I'm very confident they will be profitable in the future. 

People think we need to move to EV cars to lower Carbon Dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but transport only accounts for 16% of greenhouse gases. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, they would require either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. Maybe you might disagree here, but I think the safety concerns would make it unfeasible. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

Suppose hydrogen never took off as a fuel supply for transport. What are other uses of hydrogen? Well, key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment.

My thoughts on PLUG is that it's a bit of a lottery play. Their hydrogen plants should make them profitable in the future pretty easily, but any major developments in their fuelcell technology, or any adoption of their technology in popular car brands could easily give them a triple digit valuation over the next 10 years. However, I'm extremely bullish on Hydrogen producers, like $APD. They have great earnings, normal P/E ratios, and great growth prospects over the coming years."
2021-04-08 13:23:56,stocks,About 97% of Plug investors are still trying to recuperate those Ls.  I think the Hydrogen is intriguing   have potential but not functionally cost effective and have issues with their storage.  I still keep an eye .

2021-04-08 15:10:57,stocks,"Certified Hydrogen Safety Engineer here. No longer in the industry. Hydrogen was big 10 years ago, but even then the estimates were that it will take over in the medium term (20-30 years). US Dept of Energy even as they pushed batteries acknowledged that hydrogen vehicles will take over eventually due to storage and production benefits. I personally will not buy into any hydrogen economy plays as it is not a real economy at the moment outside of warehouses. 30 years ago who would you invest in for solar panels and are those companies still around or did china run them out of business?

Hydrogen production is mainly based on natural gas right now, so won't even be a green industry until natural gas prices rise.

When you think the producers and suppliers of hydrogen will be profitable, you have to consider the baseline, gasoline prices and now electric battery prices. Energy is still cheap. Hydrogen is easy to produce. But there is not financial incentive for the switch in the near term."

I'm looking for some companies to research in the field of Lithium-ion batteries. I'd prefer to keep my stocks on the TSX, but I'll consider other options if I like the company. 

I'm particularly interested in either the mining of Lithium, the actual development and research of the battery itself, or recycling of the battery once it's completed its lifespan in a vehicle."
2021-04-08 11:34:01,stocks,"I just started looking at those companies, too, but mainly because of energy storage. Storing energy from solar/wind/tidal energy is an interesting topic and it feels like there's a lot of business opportunity in the future.

Nouveau Monde Graphite will become the largest source of high quality graphite in the western world (currently almost all graphite is sourced from China). They also will be a carbon neutral operation and have a fleet of all-electric mining vehicles. The electricity used to power the operation is clean Quebec hydropower, which is one of the lowest-cost energy sources in the world, meaning higher margins for the company."

2021-04-08 11:05:53,stocks,What makes you bullish on lithium? Smart phone sales peaked 4 years ago and are actually slightly declining. EVs are forcasted to be adopted at such a slow rate that I don't think it will affect demand for lithium very much.

2021-04-08 12:01:49,stocks,Very interesting. I'll look into it.
2021-04-08 17:44:20,stocks,"Agreed.  I like NMGRD, but you might also look at First Cobalt ($ftssf). This company will be very important to the N. America market over the next 5 - 10 years.  Mining, refining, and black mass recycling.  It‚Äôs worth doing some DD on, IMO."
2021-04-08 14:17:51,stocks,"You do know that EVs have larger batteries than smartphones, right? 

Will take relatively few EVs to cause exponential increase of lithium above the amount used in smartphones."
2021-04-08 11:07:42,stocks,Not necessarily bullish. I just have a few hours this morning so I'm seeing what's out there and researching some of the players.
2021-04-08 14:33:15,stocks,"The thing about mined commodities is that the higher the price, the more miners enter the space and existing ones increase production and deflate the price. That's why OPEC exists in oil, to prevent suppliers from producing too much oil."

2021-04-08 11:51:46,stocks,"TL;DR they probably offered you lotto tickets instead of a raise. 

>but were recently invested in by a handful of MAJOR brands in the industry, which is very promising.

what does this mean? if a big company like Vanguard bought your company's stock that's not necessarily a vote of confidence, they're just obligated to buy everything as part of the big index funds."
2021-04-08 12:57:57,stocks,The question I would have is how are the number of UARs calculated and what are their maturation period.  Remember they may only be paid out if the company makes money.

2021-04-08 13:07:04,stocks,The big question you need to ask yourself - are you staying for the long-term and do yo think they will be profitable.
2021-04-08 13:02:23,stocks,"Not taken as rude whatsoever!

I am currently the only person in my role since we did layoffs back immediately after covid. We did go into 2 more major brand agreements since then and we are hiring back on (which makes it peculiar that I get this option instead of a raise)"
2021-04-08 00:00:00,stocks,"What stocks are actually well priced or even undervalued right now or is the answer nothing? I'm looking at the market and it seems like most stocks are still heavily inflated. Tech seems to be down, however, does seems like it'll likely be a bit shaky in the near future, given interest rates, inflation, heavy market uncertainty, and actually when you zoom out on the 1-year graph, most of tech is still very high, compared to just under a year ago. The losses from many posts seem to just be from people buying at ATHs. 

On another note, non-tech stocks looks like they're more likely to go up in the near future, however have now already risen, and at all time highs, or near it. I'm looking at Starbucks, JPM, DIS, TGT, but really works for most promising non-tech stocks.    


Seems like we're basically choosing between decent, not necessarily good or bad, but just okay priced stocks that will probably be flat in the near future, and will become a long-hold, or stocks that may also be a great long-term hold, but at very ATH prices, that we should probably expect the major gains to be over, and will likely just to be buying to go up 10% end of year, unless there's something I'm overlooking, of course ""well priced"" is also subjective, so figured I'd ask and grab some opinions."

Solid company with over 20K+ employees that does government consulting and a small amount of commercial consulting. It is just recovering from a large dip because they had one missed earnings call due to covid. I doubt they will miss earnings again, and the stock will be hot again.

Not a financial advisor. Also, I should say that I do own the stock and one options contract. It was my first time doing options so I did it with a company I feel good about and didn‚Äôt think it was a huge gamble."

Cost of lumber is through the roof and shows no signs of slowing down in the next year or two.

Canadian lumber producers have a competitive advantage for a multitude of reasons so I am invested in them.

- Rolls Royce - nothing to do with cars (they sold that off to BMW years ago) - they‚Äôre an industrial powerhouse like a leaner version of  GE, with  jet engine divisions, defence contracts, early green tech. Currently valued at $15bn - pre Covid they were making $3bn a year in pure profit

I trim my position at AMD and TSM because if Intel execute it, they have a higher pay out.

Average price target is around $31.70, below what it's been trading at for the past three days. Way more Apr. 16 calls than puts, so that adds to bullish sentiment in the short term, at least. Looks like whatever hype was propping up the price may have worked its way out this morning and $28.50 to $29 could be a good entry point. Watch it for a few days, see what it does.

2021-04-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Lumber DD: CNBC and Motley Fool's ""Best Lumber Stocks"" Unsurprisingly Are the Worst Price Performers or Are Unrelated to Lumber I had to do this cathartic post because it is hilarious how wrong/clueless the mainstream financial analysts continue to be when discussing how investors could benefit as investors from the historic surge in lumber prices.

**Context for anyone living under a rock the last 6 months**

Lumber has been surging to all-time high prices recently, with every indication that it will continue to climb for the next few months due to how massive the new home construction demand and the busy season just getting started.  The price of dimensional lumber will likely dip at some point but will still stay at 2-3x its normal price into 2022 because of how insane the new housing construction boom.  

For those that have suggested otherwise in recent reddit posts, you‚Äôre wrong and this post isn‚Äôt about that debate.  Go look at the 2021 and 2022 projections for all of the big home builders (KB, TOL, LEN, DHI, etc‚Ä¶).  Every single one is projected to have record earnings the next two years from increased home construction even with the surge in lumber prices.

**The Financial Click-Bait ‚ÄúBest Lumber Stocks‚Äù**

If you‚Äôre new to lumber and google lumber stocks to maybe see what options are out there to look into, you no doubt have run into the same laughably annoying phenomenon that I did: the mainstream financial media/internet clickbait sites (like CNBC and Motley Fool) keep on producing the same regurgitated articles titled the ‚ÄúBest ___ Lumber Stocks‚Äù or ‚ÄúBest Ways to Play the Lumber Surge‚Äù which then offer the same regurgitated hot stock tips: 

1) they recommend stocks that produce exclusively **timber** (like RYN) which get NO BENEFITS from the surge in **lumber** prices *because timber (the logs which lumber is made from) aren‚Äôt the commodity whose price is surging 3-fold*; 

2) they recommend stocks that get a large portion of their revenue/enterprise value from things other than lumber (or have such a large stock float) so that the benefits of the lumber surge will be pretty diffuse and not have a proportional impact on their stock price (e.g. WY, a clickbait favorite); or 

3) they pitch stocks like LL, Home Depot and Lowes who have done well riding the home improvement wave, but don‚Äôt actually produce their dimensional lumber at all and thus have absolutely nothing to gain from the surge in dimensional lumber prices.

For those who want to invest in this lumber super cycle, it probably would be a good idea to invest in companies *whose earnings are actually tied to the price of lumber.*  Companies like WFG, CFPZF, IFSPF and RFP (This list is not exhaustive; these are just examples).  Companies like these that largely base almost all of their income on dimensional lumber, along with wood pulp and paper for some.  (Note: wood pulp surging to a new high as well, so these guys coincidentally are enjoying a double whammy this year).  And unlike WY, these lumber players don‚Äôt have nearly the volume of outstanding shares, so the surge in lumber prices is going to translate in a proportionally larger EPS growth.

If you look at the stock price histories of these lumber companies and compare it to the historical price of lumber, their prices largely track with the changes in lumber (and to some degree wood pulp pricing).  2013 and 2018 had surges in the price of lumber and these companies‚Äô stock prices correlated with those surges.  Why? Because the price of lumber and wood pulp dictate these companies‚Äô earnings.  If you look at the timber companies, like WY and RYN, their stock prices don‚Äôt track well to lumber prices because the price of timber is separate.  In fact, despite the epic lumber surge, some timber producers are still not doing well because there is a big glut of it in some areas of the continent.

**Let‚Äôs Look at the Numbers**

In the end, it‚Äôs the numbers that matter, so let‚Äôs look at the price performance of these stocks YTD, the last 6 months and the last year.  CNBC and Motley pitched RYN, WY, LL, HD, and LOW as the best stocks to play the lumber surge.  Let‚Äôs see how they have done the last year during this surge compared to the actual lumber companies:

**Shill Stocks:** [YTD](https://imgur.com/a/ihngsVA), [6 Months]( https://imgur.com/a/2LlbPN7), and [1 Year](https://imgur.com/a/GMgb6Ta)

Other than LL, all of them have been doing ok.  Some decent growth, all decently beating the SP.  But nothing spectacular and certainly nothing showing explosive stock price growth correlating with lumber‚Äôs explosive growth. (I‚Äôll address outlier LL later.)

Now look at the **Lumber Stocks:** [YTD](https://imgur.com/a/CnYBrAb), [6 Months](https://imgur.com/a/qjTCQRQ), and [1 year](https://imgur.com/a/PAXODpp) 

I included WY to prove a point on how badly CNBC and Motley‚Äôs favorite ‚ÄúBest‚Äù pick has done compared to the actual lumber stocks.  If you look at their growth, as a group its substantially larger than WY or RYN, or these home improvement store stocks. 

**Take away from the charts:** 

The lumber stocks as a group have so far *destroyed* the shill stocks and actually show the type of growth you‚Äôd expect from a historic commodity surge.  Unsurprisingly, these lumber stocks particularly destroyed WY which is the most shilled stock by the financial clickbait media, and is probably why WY then seems to be regurgitated in a lot of the recent reddit posts on Canadian lumber stocks.  

For those correctly pointing out that LL is up 500% in the last year, if you caught that party in Q4, good job.  RFP is still beating than LL by over 200%, but still, great job.  That being said, LL‚Äôs surge isn‚Äôt because of lumber prices and any future growth again won‚Äôt be from the surge in price in dimensional lumber.  And you know that because the price of lumber has surged higher in the last three months, but LL is down ~20% in that same time frame.  Frankly, if you bought LL when CNBC told you to in January 2021, you‚Äôd be down 20-25%.  The point being that what propelled LL was not the surge in lumber and it‚Äôs future is not likely tied to any sustained lumber surge.

**Forward Looking Comments**

For those cynics who keep saying ‚ÄúLumber cycle is over.  It‚Äôs priced in,‚Äù you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about and here‚Äôs why.  These Canadian lumber stocks are all sitting roughly around their mid 2018 highs when Lumber surged to $600 MBF for 3 weeks in May 2018, and averaged about $550 MBF during the forestry‚Äôs Q2, and then crashed Q3/Q4 2018.  

For comparison, in 2021, lumber has been trading at over $1000 MBF since February, and the May futures just topped $1050 this week. [Here‚Äôs the CME futures yesterday.](https://imgur.com/a/TRWdKvE)  January 2022 futures are now closing in on $800 MBF.  It seems pretty clear all of these futures are rising and will continue to due so in the near term.  2021 earnings will likely blow 2018‚Äôs out of the water.  Yet despite the fact that these futures show these companies are about the have some of the best back-to-back quarters in industry history, they are still sitting at their 2018 highs... doesn‚Äôt sound priced in to me.

Case in point, here‚Äôs the basic [valuation ratios for the Lumber Stocks](https://imgur.com/a/fiefWln), and here‚Äôs the [valuation ratios for the Shill Stocks](https://imgur.com/a/8jd6SsU).  Despite the epic run these lumber stocks have had this last year, they are largely *still* relatively undervalued and have drastically better forward PE‚Äôs when compared to the shill stocks or other related industrial sector averages.  

**Conclusion**

I needed to write this cathartic post because I am sick of seeking these financial ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù shill the same mediocre/loser stocks as ‚Äúthe best lumber stocks‚Äù which have nothing to do with the production of lumber or are literally the worst price performers in the sector.  

I am not telling you what to buy and can‚Äôt predict who will do the best this year.  Each of the lumber stocks have their advantage and disadvantages depending on investor preferences. And who knows, maybe these shill stocks are on the cusp of some epic 1000% gains.  But if you want to find a way to benefit from the lumber surge, then it may be wise to invest in *lumber producers* who actually stand to directly gain from the surge in lumber and still have unrealized value to offer if market conditions stay on their current trajectory.  

If you are unsure if a stock you are looking at is timber or lumber, look at financial statements / website.  You will be able to see in a matter of seconds if their earnings come from timber and real estate or wood products/lumber that are actually surging in value.

Note: I am not a financial adviser.  If there is one take away from this post, **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**  Don‚Äôt trust strangers on the internet or TV.  Many of them are either lazy morons who keep regurgitating the same brainless clickbait they read somewhere or they have an ulterior motive and are selling you garbage. I'm long RFP but recognize that all of these lumber stocks will probably do well."

One of my clients works for BNSF and has told me they have millions of tons of wood products stuck in ports waiting to be frighted around the U.S. But lack of staff and backup at ports are slowing them down. So i'd be careful about investing in lumber, eventually we're going to hit a massive surplus most likely next year looking at how futures are trading and if we don't get a spike in covid.

TL;DR. Mills are ramping up production, finished wood is piling up in ports. be prepared for lumber surplus."

2021-04-08 10:33:46,stocks,"Just for your information, in finance when someone mentions a certain play, they usually aren't pure plays. What I mean by that is for example there are numerous ways to play the EV growth: you can buy battery stocks, you can buy auto manufacturers, you can buy semi conductor producers, you can buy commodities. They don't all have to produce the actual EVs themselves to be an EV play.

For RYN, higher lumber prices could be a result of higher demand, which would lead to higher demand in timber, which would increase their revenues.

WY has timberland (higher timber prices lead to higher revenues) and wood products (same concept) which could result in higher profits (since the input costs are also increasing)

Home Depot etc can charge higher prices (since they buy the logs at higher prices and there is demand for it) which could also improve profitability.

I agree to a certain extent that these financial sites are inclined towards being clickbait, but IMO their picks look ok to play the lumber price surge. Plus the companies you mentioned could be more concentrated which is riskier compared to diversified picks."

2021-04-08 12:12:40,stocks,"HD and LOW shares historically benefit  from rising lumber prices. It is not from the financial impact of lumber specifically, though that certainly helps at the margin. Lumber price boom = housing build boom = lots of professionals using HD/LOW for supplies and the professional market tends to buy higher margin goods. If lumber is scarce generally, HD and LOW have  strong long-term supply agreements so the professionals know they can get their lumber - and other secondary supplies - reliably at HD/LOW.

When there is a boom somewhere, buy the companies that sell the picks and shovels supporting that boom.

Note: I bought 700 shares of HD in the $255-260 range. There is still lots of upside in both. I think the estimates for the next few years are at least 10% too low."

2021-04-08 15:28:11,stocks,"> The U.S gets most of it's lumber from China by shipping logs there and getting finished products shipped back.

**This is completely wrong**. If you're talking about hardwood logs being made into furniture then coming back to the US, yea that happens a lot, but even then we export more lumber than logs to China ($1.5 billion vs $500 million pre trade war).

Hardwood prices have gone up since the lows of the trade war, but *Softwood* logs are what has seen the massive price spike associated with housing demand, and softwood log exports to China at the absolute peak in 2018 before the trade war were only about 5% of total production. Even if all that was coming right back to the states as lumber or plywood (and it's not, China's domestic demand is insane), it wouldn't be driving the market."
2021-04-08 15:24:42,stocks,I cant find a source that says that is true. Google tells me logs get sent over to be made into flooring and furniture. But lumber (2x4) and plywood there is lots of US production.

Yeah I thought that too and used that service.  LMND, ABNB, and FVRR have cost me a small fortune.  After they all dropped 30-50%, they removed those from their picks, conveniently.  I no longer trust anything they say.

Edit: Sorry, LMND is still there (and I still hold it).  So calm down, fanboys.  I know they're all long-term recommendations.  But being that they're long-term recommendations, why did they get rid of several recent picks like FVRR, ABNB, ZNGA, etc?

2021-04-08 12:52:58,stocks,Yep. And its forward PE ratio is still ~ 3...
2021-04-08 13:22:21,stocks,"Its eps just got adjusted by the analysts in the last week. The forward PE is now about three. 

I have my opinions on RFP. Would take a long time to explain them. Right now the analysts projecting a mean 3-4$ EPS for 2021 which would be the highest they have had in over a decade.  RFP‚Äôs price is still are about 30% under its 2018 high which had a yearly EPS of $1.96...  Also, the current projections of 3-4$ for the year currently assumes a hard crash in lumber prices after Q2 which is directly contradicted by the futures as well as the larger number of analysts projecting home construction to surge even harder in the second half of the year and into 2022. So think those projections are probably going to get changed after Q1 earnings. 

I think of it this way, conservatively, they are looking at 4-5$ EPS for the year (possibly much more depending on pulp holding its high and the paper segment from the economy continuing to reopen). At 5$ EPS, their current stock price would result in a PE Ratio of just over 2... 

Is the initial surge in lumber priced in? Largely Yes. But what isnt: a sustained (think multi-quarter) period of high lumber which is going to generate a record level of earnings for all these guys over the next few quarters."

2021-04-08 16:43:06,stocks,"I think WY will enjoy higher earnings than it did before. Im not suggesting either way whether WY is or is not a good investment. for those people who hate risk, it may be the safest, least volatile play. I think it has the highest dividend of the forestries. However, if you‚Äôre looking for the type of price performance that cyclicals are known for, i think there‚Äôs a few critical issues that will prevent WY from enjoying that exponential growth the other more focused cyclical lumber stocks are getting. 

1) while it produces a lot of lumber volume wise, a substantial portion of its income and asset value comes from its timber and real estate holdings which wont get exponential earnings growth from the surge in Lumber prices. Those lumber companies that get a higher percentage of earnings from lumber will enjoy a proportionally higher jump in earnings. 

2) because it is the biggest name and has been hyped for months by the media and clickbait, if you look at its valuation ratios, i think even the long term lumber surge is largely priced in.  So for those people who say we missed the boat on the lumber cycle, that may actually be the case for any new investor looking at WY. 

3) WY has such a substantially larger float of outstanding shares, that the surge increased earnings from lumber will be more diffuse and less impactful on the EPS. 

There‚Äôs other reasons these stocks are doing better than WY, but its related to wood pulp so i won‚Äôt get into it. 

Long story short, i think WY will see higher margins/EPS than they did previously, but I think their EPS increase from this lumber price surge will be outperformed by the EPS increase that some of these other lesser known lumber producers will enjoy, and that so far seems to be supported by the YTD, 6 month and 12 month price performance comparisons between WY the smaller lumber stocks. But in the end, time will tell."

2021-04-08 15:48:33,stocks,"That‚Äôs not a simple answer. Typically, when the party ends for any cyclical, they drop fast. For this, lumber isnt dropping hard any time soon. But also, lets say it drops 40% to 600$ MBf. If it sat at that level for the next few those would be the best years in industry history ignoring 2021. So the real question is what the new normal run rate will be when housing demand finally dies down.

But if i understand your question, yes, many building materials are surging in price for the same reason.

Also ABNB has been very strong since it IPOd I don‚Äôt know how you could consider that a loss unless you literally did the opposite of the first thing they tell you to do and *HOLD* picks for at least three years. If you‚Äôre unhappy with ABNB‚Äôs performance I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôve held it for about two months and are considering that a loss? Stock advisor is a service for investing, **not** day trading.


So yeah maybe try learn learning how the service, and investing, works."
2021-04-08 13:13:51,stocks,"A couple things:

1. They make no guarantees over short term performance. You shouldn't care if something drops or fluctuates, even by a lot. They specifically say their recommendations are for people who buy and hold for *at least* 3-5 years, because their convictions are based on buying & holding over that kind of time period.

2. I'm a SA subscriber. They are still actively recommending all three of those stocks. LMND is literally on the front page of my SA homepage. If they don't recommend a stock anymore, they will literally say that (""sell this stock"").

3. They warn you up front that not every stock is going to be a winner, and that's why you need to buy and hold a lot of stocks. If 3 out of 15 stocks in your portfolio drop by 50% in value, but you have a few that grow 500% or more (like their recommendations for Tesla, Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia, etc) you will still come out ahead. 

If you stick with the service, follow their advice and allocate equally in a broad variety of recommendations. That's how they've been able to outperform the market for so long."
2021-04-08 13:17:10,stocks,"At the risk of sounding like MF shill, those were all recommended at around Jan/Feb, pretty much every tech stocks fell hard right after and with SA, you are expected to hold for at least 3 years. Judging their pick performance by how they did in first 1~2 months is pretty pointless.

Also, they rotate out half of their recommendation list every 2 weeks so of course you won't see them recommending same pick you saw 2 months ago. If you search the ticker on their website, you'll still see the history of when they were recommended. They aren't trying to hide anything."

So so frustrating. I really do think you just don't want to acknowledge how corrupt the media is because it makes you feel bad. Everyone here is like this. The people here are not stupid and it's obvious what is going on. They simply don't want to admit it for emotional reasons I think."
2021-04-08 12:35:59,stocks,"First, when the price of anything HD or LOW has in inventory rises, the company will raise prices on the floor before they have had to pay more for the inventory. This creates a positive margin cycle as prices keep rising.

Second, I agree that HD and LOW are not good pure lumber plays. I am just highlighting that the demand increase driving lumber prices up will also help overall demand at HD and LOW. An incremental 1% increase in volumes at a HD or LOW store generally means a > 1% profit increase. If prices rise 1%, it is even better. The sell-side tends to be slow to model in these improvements. HD and LOW were already beating estimates consistently for several quarters. The building boom situation will only extend that.

My overall point is that if you want to play the rise in X, do not always look for the maker of X. You might do better owning the supplier of the maker of X or the guy that moves X, etc."

2021-04-08 18:13:11,stocks,"You could be right. I wish I had the crystal to say for sure. In the end time will tell. 

I like RFP for the value play and other reasons independent from the straight lumber play. Some of it is articulated in a prior post. At this point its valuation is getting ridiculously low given the gains it is projected to make the next few quarters from lumber and pulp, but i think the market is waiting for Q1 to prove it truly has turned the corner. Also, i think the market is hung up on RFP‚Äôs current trailing PE (which is fair) and think its priced in. But i think they don‚Äôt don‚Äôt realize that in Q4 RFP logged a special expense/write off of 80 million for idling two of their news print mills. If you ignore that one-time, special expense it would change their current PE from 100 to ~12 or 13. So that write off masked the momentum they were building in Q4 and is going to create a much larger splash at Q1 2021. 

Either way, its always hard to predict which horse gonna go the farthest in the end. We each gotta just pick one (or more) and see where it goes."

I have 10k to invest and have read that growth and value stocks behave differently during economic recoveries and want to better understand how so that my money will grow hopefully have higher returns.(I'm limiting my options to ETFs like VOOG, )

Based on past performance (a dirty thing to say,I know), how have growth and value behaved in times of bullish growth following an economic downturn?

Note: my portfolio is primarily VTI, VXUS and a 15% small-cap value tilt so this 10k is not that significant, but I'd still like to grow it as much as I can.

Historically, until recently, small value outperforms."
2021-04-08 12:40:47,stocks,"Empirical studies are very clear that small cap value is one of the best - if not the best - equity factor coming out of a recession-related sell-off. That is what the COVID correction was as the market was pricing in a deep recession from the lockdowns. The superiority of small cap value over small caps in general persists for 2-3 years. After that, small cap growth tends to catch up. Regardless of which valuation factor you choose, small caps tend to outperform large caps for 3-5 years after a recessionary correction. 

So I would recommend IWM and not worry about value vs growth."

I'm looking to hit a financial milestone within 5 years, and that's why I'm looking at this from an admittedly more short term perspective.

2021-04-08 17:10:49,stocks,"So after the stock exploded I took a look and now have 2% position in VIAC. If you have read about family that basically runs VIAC they been reported saying that to compete with major streamers (Netflix and others) all smaller media companies have to consolidate into one mega corp to have bargaining power for sports streaming and media portfolio that can compete with major streamers. They been saying this for a while actually and the first step was to merge Viacom with CBS. That came to be (with some corporate drama) and now rumour is that when this merger is digested ViacomCBS will merge with Discovery (and it's quite legit rumour confirmed from multi sources). Also, there are other rumours (less confirmed) that ViacomCBS might buy out or merge with Lionsgate and/or MGM. They been eyeing Sony studios but Sony is unlikely to sell. Anyway, if all goes to plan in few years time we could have mega streaming corp that owns most of the ""legacy"" TV shows and films. That's a strategy that I like and that I think makes sense. I also love how VIAC approaches streaming. Which is that they have their own platform but also license out their content to Netflix and Amazon. It's better to collect licensing money from big players than to fight with them. Pretty smart. At current valuation of 10x p/e (priced for nuclear war) I'm willing to take long bet and wait this out for few years. I think there could be some very nice appreciation. I mean if you look at peer companies they are priced at similar PE from 9x to 14x so I don't think it should go down much more. Worst case it will go sideways and I'll collect pretty good divi. My biggest worry is the debt and possibly of share dillusion. However, they recently did really smart thing when they issued new shares at $80 and collected a lot of money from that just before implosion. Smart move by management. Again there are problems but at current valuation, what the heck, worth a shot."
2021-04-08 13:01:51,stocks,"If you look at the chart over the last year - it was forming a base around $36-37 before the January run-up.  I think the run-up was cause by the ""family office"" leveraging itself; thus I expect it to revert to the mean and reach that level or slightly above.  

I am watching for $40 and will probably dip in as I like their properties and catalog."
2021-04-08 13:25:42,stocks,"I'm just wondering what people think VIAC SHOULD be worth since based on current market average P/E stats they seem grossly undervalued.

At 12x consensus 2021 EPS we're talking $48 per and 15x gets you to $60. I don't think either is even close to unreasonable if they can show even a little bit of top-line growth over the course of the year. At market average 40x P/E you'd be talking $160 but I don't think you have to assume it gets anywhere close to that to be a worthwhile bet."

2021-04-08 09:24:36,stocks,can anyone explain the faith in plug??
2021-04-08 08:36:10,stocks,"Wow, I'm very surprised they increased their holding with PLUG.  I'm not complaining since I have long calls, but I know a lot of people were upset at how heavily weighted PLUG was since it took a hit from its all time high back in January of $75.  They must have a lot of faith in PLUG - hopefully this is a sign that the 'accounting errors' were minimal and not a huge issue.  

&#x200B;

Time will tell.  Thanks for sharing!"
2021-04-08 09:11:43,stocks,I read April 16th is the big day for their rebalancing. Is that still true?
2021-04-08 10:12:07,stocks,That is a lot of eggs in one very shaky basket with Plug...
2021-04-08 12:32:40,stocks,"I've been bagholding ICLN (it's currently my only position that's red overall) waiting for some good news.  
  
Not sure what they're thinking buying more PLUG. I think I'll just take my loss and sell this shit."
2021-04-08 13:45:18,stocks,"Not happy about the increase of PLUG. I am strong on green energy, but not on PLUG. Not sure if I will keep holding long now"
2021-04-08 10:56:02,stocks,This is one of my biggest regrets and one of my biggest mistake as an investor. I bought when Biden took office and has been dipping ever since. Hopefully it rebounds
2021-04-08 11:52:42,stocks,I‚Äôm waiting to break even on ICLN and then put this money elsewhere lol
2021-04-08 11:25:21,stocks,more PLUG???????
2021-04-08 08:37:34,stocks,This thing has been dead in the water most of this year. Hoping the green sector picks up soon as that's where most of my individual stocks are.
2021-04-08 11:57:15,stocks,What's 968? Could be XINYI Solar traded in Hong Kong. It fits the overall idea of ICLN.
2021-04-08 13:56:23,stocks,So I guess I was wrong. I‚Äôm definitely staying away from it now. Too much faith in Plug.
2021-04-08 19:50:19,stocks,"I don‚Äôt Understand, PLUG was already their biggest holding when you all bought in? So why did you invest in the first place? It‚Äôs taken a dump recently like a lot of other stocks and everyone is now anti-plug."
2021-04-08 09:12:38,stocks,"so their top holding is overvalued and unprofitable and had to re-state 2 years of earnings... but they sold 55 million shares of an undervalued, profitable company (118% return on capital!) that pays a 9% dividend yield? 

jebus, I don't know how anyone could invest in this piece of trash."
2021-04-08 10:39:39,stocks,"Thanks OP!

Man, I can't believe I bought 9 individual stocks this year and it's the clean energy etf the one giving me losses... This ""rebalancing"" actually makes me lose even more faith in the etf."
2021-04-08 10:31:33,stocks,"Wow they really increased their position in PLUG lol. A company that has no major products, horrible financials, is dealing with lawsuits from different firms, and messed up their balance sheets. Literally that company is no different from NKLA. Also they decreased CIG and NOVA. If anything screams don‚Äôt buy this ETF its this."

2021-04-08 09:54:16,stocks,"I can't speak for anyone else, but I think hydrogen has a better future than EV. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future, the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. I have my eyes on $APD, personally I think thats a good long term bet, but PLUG is one of them more riskier plays. With their creation of Hydrogen plants, plus one of the biggest hydrogen plants in the US, I'm very confident they will be profitable in the future, but if they make any massive progress with their fuelcells, then I can easily see a mid triple digit price target. I do remember seeing somewhere that the hydrogen market would be worth $1 trillion somewhere, but I couldn't find the source for it, so don't trust me on the last point, but that was another reason why I'm bullish."
2021-04-08 15:11:36,stocks,"$ICLN is tracking an index, there isn't faith involved.  It tracks S&P Global Clean Energy Index (SPGTCLEN), the purpose of that index is to index the strength of the clean energy market, not to provide investment returns."
2021-04-08 08:45:43,stocks,"I'm thinking the same way. I might buy some shares and DCA down if I get the opportunity over the next few weeks. $15-20 mil of shares bought is a lot to buy on a whim, I think they must have a good reason to believe these accounting errors really are nothing. Only time will tell, but I like the prospects of hydrogen anyways, so it's a company I don't mind buying into."
2021-04-08 09:19:43,stocks,"I'm not sure, but this is their latest portfolio. Maybe they will rebalance again, but having a big rebalancing wouldn't make sense, since they had also bought 130k shares as of March 31st. I think the whole big rebalancing thing was just speculation, but maybe someone else can prove me wrong."
2021-04-08 10:16:19,stocks,Someone else said that they're adding 70 more stocks to reduce volatility.

2021-04-08 08:41:05,stocks,"Well considering that they increased the majority of their positions, I think it would make it much easier to reach its previous numbers. I think $36 would be a stretch, but I can definitely see $30 before EOY if they continue to increase their positions at the dip"

2021-04-08 09:25:28,stocks,"If I had to take a guess, it could be that they see limited growth in the company. It peaked in 2012 and has been on a downward journey ever since. I also don't like that high dividend yield. That money could be going back into the company, but instead they pay out investors? And a 9% payout as well?"
2021-04-08 10:38:14,stocks,"I'm very confident it will break 30 at some point this year again. The question is when rather than if. They've increased their positions in the majority of stocks they hold, which means it should be relatively easy to push back to 30, compared to the last time."
2021-04-08 11:21:37,stocks,"I would respectfully disagree. Between black, grey, blue & green hydrogen, hydrogen production will always be a byproduct of a industrial process. Becoming a dominant fuel source isn‚Äôt going to happen when it‚Äôs always second fiddle to electrification. That‚Äôs not to say hydrogen doesn‚Äôt have it‚Äôs place.  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprise if hydrogen gets a niche market like as a backup fuel for power turbine on high demand days on the grid.

Infrastructure investment (not just Biden‚Äôs plan) is going to towards electrification. And with EVs having dual purpose to store grid energy and transport people & goods. Why also develop mass infrastructure to widely transport & store hydrogen.

Again, hydrogen has it‚Äôs place but it‚Äôs not in the transportation sector. 

Full disclosure: I also have a large position in iCLN and I plan to hold."
2021-04-08 09:56:17,stocks,They‚Äôre adding 70 more stocks on the 16th to the holding in order to reduce the volatility of this ETF

2021-04-08 17:37:19,stocks,Also because Brazil is an absolute mess of a country right now ‚Äî they‚Äôre managing risk
2021-04-08 11:36:35,stocks,"I like to hear opposition, if everyone agreed, the stock would be valued far higher than it is right now. However, what I will say is that there's a lot more to hydrogen than vehicles. Even so, the likes of airplanes and other heavy vehicles have no hope of running on electricity. With planes, the only feasible clean solutions for power are nuclear and hydrogen. If I'm not mistaken, Airbus began research into running planes with hydrogen fuel cells back in September 2020. Even without the transport industry, there's growing demand for hydrogen in the steel industry, for production of petroleum coke, and development in the cement  and power generations also account for a lot of growth in the hydrogen market. To add to this, growing regulations to control and curb the sulfur content in fuels is expected to drive the market for hydrogen generation. I have some far dated leaps on APD because I think it will grow massively over the next 2 years. As for transport, I think we all may end up pleasantly surprised. If you asked people whether they'd buy EV cars 5 years ago, they'd almost certainly say no. Like I said, PLUG is a bit of a lottery play, nobody knows where hydrogen fuel cells will end up in the next 5 years, just as nobody knew where EV cars would end up 5 years ago but I'm very confident they will be profitable in the near future with their hydrogen plants."
2021-04-08 12:57:42,stocks,"> Again, hydrogen has it‚Äôs place but it‚Äôs not in the transportation sector

You're absolutely correct on this point, and outside of the mirai pretty much everyone in transportation agrees.  However, there's still several huge markets for hydrogen.  I'm not sure it's correct to call them niche as they may be bigger than the ev sector.  That being said, I'm not super keen on plug, hearing weird rumblings, and the latest spat with air doesn't sound good."
2021-04-08 09:57:56,stocks,Thanks!
2021-04-08 13:56:51,stocks,"I'm a little hesitant on the whole hydrogen thing myself but more so from a safety standpoint. I haven't heard anything about safety mechanisms in place and the last vehicles I can recall being powered by hydrogen we're zeppelins. Going back to the Hindenburg disaster, I've always been skeptical of a vehicle powered by hydrogen. What's to stop a similar series of auto related explosions in the event of collision? This maybe a really stupid point but it's definitely something I would want to know if I were a consumer looking to move into alternative energy vehicle ownership."
2021-04-08 14:06:53,stocks,"This may be a concern for the most uninformed of consumers, but it's a little scary to see it on an investor forum, as you pointed out.  Lithium batteries are much scarier from an explosion standpoint in my mind.


Either way, moot point bc hydrogen in transportation is dead, except for maybe some weird edge cases like giant ships"

2021-04-08 00:00:00,stocks,Margin Debt at its peak There‚Äôs been a bunch of talk of over leveraged family offices lately. Took a closer look at margin debt. Margin debt grew to 800 Billion in March. Twice the real growth rate as the S&P. Is the market at its peak? Is a 10-20% correction coming this year?Are we in the beginning stages of another secular bear? Food for thought.
2021-04-08 09:08:06,stocks,"short-term, high margin debts is associated with instability and bubbles. 

long-term, these cycles happen every decade or 15 years and it's nothing we haven't seen before."
2021-04-08 07:13:20,stocks,"Tbh I don‚Äôt really think it matters. Whether it‚Äôs next week or next decade another recession will occur eventually.

Beyond that, trying to time the market or worrying about what‚Äôs right around the corner seems like a waste of energy to me, regardless of what happens I‚Äôm not deviating from my investment strategy."
2021-04-08 06:30:17,stocks,"A 10% correction isn't really a big deal. The markets fell that far in a day and a half last year.

Additionally, it depends on whether it's the Dow, Nasdaq, S&P, Russell. 

Any one of those could fall 10% while the others don't."

2021-04-08 06:57:01,stocks,wont a 10% correction will lead to a wave of margin calls since everyone is leveraged up?

2021-04-08 09:14:11,stocks,"I think what the first guy was saying was that his investment strategy already accounts for volatility in the market.  If you are confident in the companies you own, don‚Äôt use leverage etc. and the market dips then there really is no reason to worry."
2021-04-08 15:41:03,stocks,"Not necessarily, just that you have a plan for a recession, know what your ""worst case"" is, and know that you can survive that without panicking or making things worse. It could also mean that your strategy doesn't change based on market conditions. For example, if you're just putting x% of each paycheck into something like the classic 3 fund blend you don't need to modify anything to account for changing market conditions. You just keep plugging away and wait for the markets to recover. 

Personally I'm much closer to the latter approach. I'm not a 100% Bogelhead style passive investor, but I'm close. I can increase my lifetime earnings far more by applying my free time to my actual job and getting promotions and pay raises than by spending my free time optimizing my portfolio and investment strategies, and it's nice to just mentally compartmentalize that part of my life away and not stress over it."
2021-04-08 09:54:39,stocks,If you believe in the efficient market hypothesis you shouldn‚Äôt have any investment strategy other than passive and long.  I believe markets are mostly (pretty much overwhelmingly) efficient but to each their own.
2021-04-08 14:11:21,stocks,"Not op, but no I definitely don‚Äôt try to adjust my portfolio. I buy jnto great companies, if they move downwards or sideways for a couple years who cares."
2021-04-08 07:23:25,stocks,"Not everyone is leveraged.

The issue with the margin call is that one party starts things going and perception by others start the avalanche by selling their holding based on fear of the unknown.

If the Fed didn't say that they'd backstop the market until they actually saw inflation, that Archegos thing could have caused enough panic to impact other areas. Someone sees that VIAC is down 50% and dumps their Disney shares fearing a crash. Then someone else decides to sell their Comcast shares because the sector is under pressure. It doesn't require leverage. It's a sentiment market.

The real party starts when people realize how nonsense Tesla's valuation is and that ARK is a lot riskier than people let on."
2021-04-08 12:01:07,stocks,"LOL, no. Even if you use all of your available margin on robinhood to buy VTI/VOO, it would have to drop 40-50% to get margin called. The chances of that happening are slim. People need to educate themselves on margin and use it to make more money since rates are so cheap atm."

2021-04-08 09:13:33,stocks,"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

**Bull Case:**

* Papa Biden has [pumped the market](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-says-hes-willing-to-negotiate-on-28-corporate-tax-proposal-11617821011) by suggesting that he's open to finding a way to fund his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan without raising taxes.
* The market reacted fairly positively to the Fed's FOMC minutes yesterday.
* We have broken above our hardest resistance line in premarket trading. The next really strong resistance line is the all-time high.

**Bear Case:**

* J. Powell is speaking at noon.
* [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) are higher than expected.

It looks to me like the bulls are going to beat the bears today. J. Powell has historically been a market killer, but his speech today isn't very important and isn't being hyped-up. It seems like the market might ignore it -- especially with Biden continuing his so far perfect track record of pumping up the market.

I am forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 13,877** and a **low of 13,776.**

That suits ark of being extremely risky for aggressive business growth. Unless TSLA will combine spaceX and neuralink together, then I'll agree with tsla as largest holding.

Forgot to mention her BTC target price is 500k, that's way better than tsla's best case scenario so she should believe SQ has more room to go by going balls deep for crypto lol. Wonder if she will release a price target report for SQ."

It's finally to the point where I have some money to plan for retirement and I'm looking for thoughts on setting up an IRA. Couple questions though...

Do you need anything special to set up and IRA or just open that type of account with your trading platform? I have an email out to my CPA on this, but prefer to get other inputs as well. (I use E-Trade at the moment)

I'm sort of leaning towards focusing on REITs and other dividend stocks because I like the idea of reinvesting the dividends to compound the stocks and eventually, hopefully,  having a decent income stream at retirement.

* Russia and Argentina have followed China in restricting crop shipments to suppress domestic prices. 
* Nigeria, Sudan and Ethiopia have been experiencing massive inflation in food prices and the privatization followed by foreign acquisitions has resulted in domestic supply problems for the region. This year locusts have ravaged crops due to hurricanes flooding deserts. The size and destructive power of the locust swarm had been increasing. 
* The floods in China have caused lasting and significant damage to the most fertile regions in China, food rationing and high prices for soybeans and pork have been ongoing and widespread.

2021-04-08 06:57:26,stocks,"Can't guarantee what will happen day by day, but I'm sure it will be happening overall this year. Federal interest rates aren't changing, which we knew back... a long time ago, but Powell had to tell us 20 times. Bond yields aren't federal interest rates, just a sign of rising inflation, and now magically nobody cares about them anymore because it's not a real problem and all still historically low. Everything will still be historically low if Biden gets his entire plan. 10 yr yield will go up though a little more and probably cause some continued short term choppiness, I'd imagine.

Apple and Amazon had fallen back to November prices before the growth stocks, and they mostly bottom out there and started rising. The rest of tech is following suit. First the quality tech stocks that aren't first tier, and for most of the year, I'd expect all of growth is still going to do pretty good, even if last year can never happen again."

I went 70% VTI, 20% VUG, 10% IWM in my boomer portfolio.   VTi is total US market, VUG is large cap growth, IWM is small cap, lot of potential in the up and comers.    

VT is good too, total world index (60/40 us/world). Vanguard thinks international will outperform the US over the next decade, and have in the past, Buffett says stick with S&P 500.

People forget that even if they have no other major projects on the roadmap, they can pump CP2077 expansions every year with new features, making people to go back to the game. Financial report for 2020 should be very good, because even if they lost quite a lot of their reputation, they at least earned something from it, so they will be able to invest it into free DLCs and free features before the next expansion lands. They still have quite a lot in their favor, most importantly - they can afford to give away free stuff to make up for this shitshow. Imagine just one compelling expansion that would introduce some more in-depth mechanics to the game, and it's suddenly a different game. The game's tech is pretty strong. Everything is possible though so do your own research.

In conclusion: if you're a trader / gamble short term, these things matter. If you're an investor they mostly don't.

I had to sweat it out a bit and it would be a bit more than your entire bank roll (it was my entire bank roll...) so huge risk but I wouldn't call it a crazy call.  The riskiest part about it was my discipline/ability to. know when to sell for a slight loss if things went south or sideways (as my prior educational options plays I just watched them fall to .01 instead of getting out at a 50% loss... of course those I was buying OTM calls for cheap (1-200$).   
 
But especially with low $$ you kind of have to take bigger, but still calculated, risks to move the needle.  

This trade is working out well thus far, although, during the little dip yesterday I ""rolled"" that call to a 125c May 21 @6.10, banking $75 in the process (and currently missing out on ~135, and rising, in gains on the Apr 120c  learning  a good lesson about Delta in the process).

If you that by the end of the year then it‚Äôs probability not going to happen unless you want to risk it on super speculative stuff (though you will likely loss more than you gain). If you want safe, consistent returns over say 5-7 years then something like VTI/VOO are the best bet."

2021-04-08 14:14:08,stocks,"DIA, VOO and QQQ. You will almost certainly walk away with greater than 10% gain and likely much much more."

the GME squeeze in Jan was pure luck (well roaringkitty had certain insight) but HFs will not be making the same mistake.

If the answer is new hires and latest results - those are fundamentals and surely already priced in. I just no longer understand what WSB is on about with buying more GME"

The thing is Intel, amd, and many companies make supercomputer CPUs and the tech used is light years ahead of what apple is doing bc apple doesn't do it.   Granted it's far more advanced than anything on the consumer market but still. I don't buy this next tech revolution.  Rumors persist they're gonna copy Google and do an apple glass or some AR tech. 

Besides, the future of cpus is moving away from silicon.

So now I need it to be 139 by January or so, but I'm feeling a lot better about that by the day. Those bags were heavy for a while. I did hedge some which helped, so I did realize some gains on those dips to minimize losses.

2021-04-08 11:12:06,stocks,"Well, compatibility is always going to be part of it. Windows has never built great software for ARM based systems. Windows RT was a disaster. If their hand is forced though, they‚Äôll invest more time and money in to it, and it seems they already have. 

Now sure, this chip generally isn‚Äôt going to outwork an Epyc or a Xeon, but keep in mind, this is a first generation consumer chip, not an enterprise level chip like those listed above. The entire system that an M1 is on costs less than the CPUs alone, and perform almost comparably at 1/5 the power consumption. It‚Äôs the first in a very gradual transition. When we start getting the X variants and subsequent generations of M series chips, you‚Äôre going to see some enormous things, and companies like Microsoft, Intel, and AMD are going to have their hands forced. 

When you compare the chips to the i9s and the 900/950 Ryzen chips, in compute tasks like exporting and rendering, Apple‚Äôs chips are embarrassing those chips, cutting times by more than 50%. It‚Äôs almost unheard of. As a tech guy myself, it‚Äôs honestly mind boggling. I bought an M1 mini to use as a home server, but I‚Äôve found that when I need to do video rendering, I end up using that over my 9900k system because of how fast and cool it runs for tasks like that.

Regarding the AR aspect, I‚Äôve never been sold on it, but one thing Apple has done since like the iPhone 6 and 7 series is build devices with AR in mind. When they‚Äôre ready to bring AR to the world, everyone will already have a compatible device in their hands. Apple is notorious for showing us why we need a device that we didn‚Äôt know existed, and while I‚Äôm not crazy about AR, I‚Äôm sure Apple will do it right."

2021-04-08 11:58:53,stocks,"ROKU is a growth stock and most growth stocks are at least a little overvalued compared to current earnings; that doesn't mean it isn't worth investing in! I usually look for profitability, market cap compared to other stocks in sector, and P/E. 

Here ROKU was profitable the last two quarters for the first time in 4 years. I honestly don't know any ROKU competitors besides Google (Chromecast), Amazon (Firestick), and Apple (Apple TV), and those obviously aren't comparable in market cap with ROKU, but worth thinking about if it will continue to dominate this sector. Now their P/E, based on last quarters earnings (12/31/2020), they earned $0.55 earnings per share, so their current price $376 divided by $0.55 gives them a P/E of 683, which is, if you have been paying attention to other stocks P/E, a lot.

But hand in hand with P/E goes earnings growth %, which is forecasted to be 47.1%, which is high! But probably not enough for a P/E of 683.

In comparison is Amazon forecasted to grow earnings with 24.9% YoY with a P/E of 79.23.

2021-04-08 17:20:20,stocks,Explain then
2021-04-08 17:12:44,stocks,"Those are some good questions, and I'll try to explain the difference between investing and day / swing trading.

Investing is basically (unless anything fundamentally changes for the worse) buying and holding a stock / ETF for 5 years. If you're looking at resistance and support you're trading. You can make money doing that, but to be honest, there are very few famous traders, almost exclusively investors. 

It's also less stressful. Look up dollar cost averaging - basically buying monthly to ensure you're getting a good cost basis. Example: you bought 1 ROKU tomorrow for $370. Next week it falls to $340 you buy 1 more. Then it drops to $300 the week after and you buy one more. Now your cost basis / share price average is $336, so anything above $336 is a profit to you. 

Time in the market > timing the market has been proven over and over again. Invest early and often.

If you're in individual stocks only, find 12-18 you like, preferably from different sectors. Invest in them monthly, and with any money you can spare. Future you will thank yourself!

So find some good stocks, and buy them repeatedly, and don't bother with the technicals. They don't matter in the long run. 

Here's an example portfolio, 12 stocks, growth focused:

8.3% $ROKU (Telecom)
8.3% $ENPH (semiconductor / green energy)
8.3% $QQQ (just buy apple, Tesla, Microsoft, amazon, fb, nflx etc together)
8.3% APPS (ad tech)
8.3% JNJ (health care)
8.3% KTOS / LMT (defense)
8.3% Z / EXPI (real estate tech)
8.3% PINS (social media)
8.3% SQ (finance)
8.3% DIS (entertainment)
8.3% SWKS / DT (cloud tech)
8.3% O (real estate with monthly dividend)

A portfolio like this where you just keep buying the stocks every month is basically guaranteed to make you money in the long run."
2021-04-08 18:35:15,stocks,Yeah that other guy was a bit aggressive. But indeed these law suits show up on pretty much every single stock that is trading below it's ATH.

2021-04-08 19:32:35,stocks,"Wow thank you again for taking the time to respond in such detail. I really appreciate it. I started investing in November 2020. I bought a bunch of individual stocks and ETFs. I‚Äôve learned a lot in that time and am gravitating to a more passive approach. I‚Äôm currently consolidating and reducing my holdings since I have too many and it‚Äôs just too much to stay on top of for my style. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôd like a combined approach between the two strategies that you mentioned. I‚Äôd love to dca into VOO, QQQ, a couple ETFs and the rest individual growth stocks. Maybe one or two gambles with play money. I know that portfolio you mentioned was just an example, but it‚Äôs a damn good one! I‚Äôve been looking at DIS and Z/ZG too. My goal is to let some things recover (I‚Äôm currently down 7% overall) and slowly transition into a more manageable portfolio over the next few months. Thanks again!"

It worked really well for me in the super bull tech market, because it was tough to make a wrong decision there, but I'm thinking of switching to momentum trading for the current market.

I'm working on redesigning my portfolio to be some things I hold for a long time and a smaller portion to shorter trades. The reason for shorter trades is that I'm a grad student with some savings, low income, and no debt. So I don't want a ton of risk, but it would be not meaningless to make a little money short term. In a year, I have a decent chance to at least triple my income, provided the job market doesn't tank. Unless I do super well with the short term trades, I'll likely switch to all long term positions at that point."

I like how diversified it is, but the issue seems to be whenever it gets its legs going, it either gets sold (like today) or the Chinese government steps in because it is getting too big.

Tencent is undervalued. The Chinese government won‚Äôt cut the legs of one of their biggest tech company.

Those companies make a profit from these plans, however I don't know how much the expansion would transition employer coverage to the ACA plans which would be less profitable. Bottom line is that these large insurers still make money from ACA expansion and employer plans are likely to persist. I see ACA expansion as improving revenue for the insurers but a transition from fee for service to outcome based would potentially hurt the majority of establishes healthcare companies whether it's pharma or insurance or medical devices.

On the other side if present ACA is expanded or funding increases with the marketplace approach I have my eye on OSCR.

2021-04-07 21:15:01,stocks,if you happen to have fidelity you can get a zero maintenance cost (with no minimum buy in) investment fund. for instance FZROX is the equivalent of VTI.
2021-04-07 23:25:38,stocks,"A mutual fund is a fund that you contribute to that then goes out and buys a bunch of stock in a wide variety of companies. If the companies the fund is invested in go up in value, your money in the mutual fund goes up.

If the fund is actively managed there will be people doing a bunch of analysis trying to pick the best companies to invest in. If the fund is passively managed, the fund will simply buy stocks that are in an index (for example the S&P500). Since the actively managed fund has to pay a bunch of people to do analysis, they are more expensive than passive index funds. Each mutual fund will have it's own stock ticker, for example the Fidelity US Total Market Index mutual fund is FZROX. But mutual funds have this weird thing where they can only be bought or sold at the end of the day, that's where ETFs come in.

ETFs are exactly the same as mutual funds except that they are traded like stocks, ETF stands for Exchange-Traded-Funds, they are mutual funds that are traded like stocks on a stock exchange. If you are holding long term there is basically no difference between ETFs and mutual funds.

Hope that clarifies a bit."

It doesn't really matter which you go with so long as you are doing an apples to apples comparison. 

Historically you got mutual funds so you could just regularly purchase like $100 per week and that automatically would handle whatever fraction of shares you owned. 

Whereas with ETFs you could not make automatic purchases of fixed dollar amount because you could not buy fractional shares. You'd always have to purchase full shares so it was more cumbersome.

2021-04-07 23:27:37,stocks,"I would just say be careful of mutual funds. I just have horror stories.

1. I asked how often the MF was balanced, and I was told quarterly or semi-annually. So how does that justify their management fees?
2. Watch out for management fees. I had to invest my moms retirement, after I freaked out after reviewing the advice of  her bank financial advisor. She had most of her funds in bonds, and the Mgmt fee was 2.65 %, and her part of the return was 2.26%, for a total bond fund return of 4.91%. She was barely getting anything, let alone her returns keeping up with inflation.
3. Hidden fees. I was so disappointed in the performance of my mutual funds, that I decided to pull it out and invest them in ETF's. Back-ended fees, are commissions taking out when you withdraw from the mutual fund. I lost 18K when I choose to self-manage my money. It's insane these fees.
4. Mutual fund transactions can take upwards of 2 days to settle. 

I'm sure some people like mutual funds, but I really do de-test them. I think banks just put too many hidden fees in them, and it's what bank financial advisors push on to people. Come to our Bank, and we'll sell you our mutual fund product.

Be careful!"
2021-04-08 17:21:36,stocks,"They are basically the same. There are four relatively unimportant differences worth highlighting:

First, ETF's sometimes trade at a slightly different price than the value of their assets. Like all their holdings, for instance, add up to $100/share, but you may have to pay $100.07 for it. Since mutual funds update their prices after the market closes, you submit the buy/sell during the day and they are able to execute that order at exactly the value of their holdings. 

Second, ETF's allow for market timing at a precision not available to mutual funds. This could be good or bad. For most people this is probably bad, because that is an added temptation that could interfere with a long term plan. Theoretically, if you were able to catch the market at a dip/peak accurately, this would provide an advantage for an ETF. Or if the market is crashing, you could sell before bottom and buy back in lower. But try avoiding this as an 18 year old in an IRA. 

Third, until 2023 (upon expiration of a Vanguard patent) ETF's will be slightly better for tax purposes. This only makes a difference in taxable accounts, not the Roth IRA, and even then it's a small difference. 

Fourth, you can buy and sell options on some ETF's which I don't think you can do for mutual funds. Again, not particularly relevant for your situations. Even then, if you wanted to hedge a mutual fund, you could option a similar ETF, which would word almost as well. 

Ultimately, for 99% of investors the differences are not worth even considering. But you asked."

2021-04-07 21:36:49,stocks,"So much wrong here. 

>	Mutual funds are managed by managers in which case there‚Äôs a fee associated with it

Not quite. There‚Äôs tons of funds that are passively managed, and their fees are extremely low, typically less than 0.1%. 

>	An index fund is usually a better choice

This makes no sense. Both a mutual fund and an ETF can track an index fund. The S&P500 is an index fund. $SPY is an ETF that tracks it, for example. $SWPPX is a mutual fund that tracks it."
2021-04-08 09:05:13,stocks,"ETFs are also managed by managers, either a passive management (VTI) or active management (ARK). 

all ETFs and mutual funds have fees, apart from Fidelity's zero fee index funds."
2021-04-08 08:17:12,stocks,"This is very aggressive, our current understanding of theory and empirical data seems to indicate that this would give the best long term returns but it also comes with a tremendous amount of risk and you should always leave room for theory and data to be wrong or skewed. This is the index fund equivalent of yoloing AAPL and MSFT calls (your suggestion is obviously still much smarter than that though)."
2021-04-08 09:02:51,stocks,">Watch out for management fees.

this is a fair point, but ETFs don't always have lower fees than mutual funds. FZROX is a US total market index with zero fees, which is lower than VTI (a US total market ETF). 

>Hidden fees. I was so disappointed in the performance of my mutual funds, that I decided to pull it out and invest them in ETF's. Back-ended fees, are commissions taking out when you withdraw from the mutual fund. I lost 18K when I choose to self-manage my money. It's insane these fees

mutual funds that have front-load and back-end fees are usually sold by smaller brokers, like someone working at an Edward Jones office. but you can get funds without these fees from other brokerage companies. it's not accurate to blame all mutual funds, because you got a few bad mutual funds. 

this one is partly on you for not understanding what you were investing in, and what the other options were. 

>Mutual fund transactions can take upwards of 2 days to settle

so do ETF transactions. it's called the T+2 rule, transaction day + 2 days. sell an ETF today (Thursday, 8 April) and it won't fully settle till Monday."

2021-04-08 08:00:45,stocks,"Looking at fidelity's website its 1-year returns are 62% (keep in mind though that one year ago was basically the bottom of the covid dip, but that's also when a lot of people started investing so maybe that's a fair comparison) and lifetime returns are 16%. It's pretty new so theres not a lot of lifetime though, dont expect numbers like that moving forward"
2021-04-08 08:04:09,stocks,"Some mutual funds are not available as ETFs, for example FZROX is getting popular since it has no expense ratio, but there is no ETF version of it.

Additionally like I said, mutual funds and most ETFs are meant to be held for decades so the ability to trade them during exchange hours isn't really that big of a benefit. It's like getting a lollipop when you go to the doctor, sure it's nice but you're not going to pick your doctor based off of it."
2021-04-08 08:58:17,stocks,">What I don't understand is why anyone is still using mutual funds, then? Is there any advantage?

if you're holding for years or decades, the only main advantage to ETFs is for minimizing capital gains in a taxable brokerage. otherwise how often do you NEED to cash out in the middle of the day, and can't wait until the markets closes to get a price? 

ETFs don't necessarily have an advantage for fees. FZROX has a lower annual fee than VTI (or than VTSAX, for that matter). 

lots of 401k, Roth IRA plans (maybe all 401ks?) don't have ETFs. this probably accounts for the vast bulk of mutual funds assets in things like S&P 500 indexes from Vanguard and the other big industry names. 

some fund managers have very very very long track records of good management, strong performance, and deep brand loyalty. e.g., Dodge & Cox has funds dating back to the 1930s. There's a small cap fund from T Rowe Price that has averaged 13-14% since the Eisenhower administration (OTCFX). American Funds is decent, if you can avoid the front load feel; look up the performance history of AGTHX over the past 50 years. 

Forced to take a choice, I'd select a company like Dodge & Cox in a heartbeat over some new trendy new ETF.. odds that ARK will be around 90 years after inception? very low."

2021-04-07 21:49:15,stocks,"Most of the passively managed mutual funds are just index funds. I will admit when I hear the term mutual fund, I think of the actively managed ones but you‚Äôre right an index fund can be considered a mutual fund.

And yes, the $SPY ETF tracks the fund, but there are a number of ETFs whose descriptions are confusing. Which is why I said they were ok. And again you may be right calling out my biases as I‚Äôd be more tempted to try and trade an ETF compared to a mutual fund. Which is counter to some degree the point of ‚Äúboring‚Äù index funds. But that might be my issue and not a general investor‚Äôs"
2021-04-08 11:01:22,stocks,"Agreed. Some of this started when i just started investing like OP. You go to your bank, talk to an advisor, and buy on their recommendations. No one told me about management fees and the different types. My parents are blue collar and clueless about finance, so I learned nothing from them.

It wasn't until i graduated university and met business people at my job that i got real useful advice. 

But seriously, bankers don't have your interest at heart. Unless you bring up management fees, they won't say anything. And when you do, that's when they bring up their other low fee alternatives. That makes me angry, especially if you're low income and you need every penny."

This really brought to my attention Buffet's quote of ""be fearful when others are¬†**greedy**, and¬†**greedy**¬†when others are fearful.‚Äù I noticed this is occurring within your typical Chinese stocks. Many of these we talk about quite often in this sub.¬†

Looking at companies like $BABA, $TME, $BIDU, $JD and $IQ, most of them have fallen anywhere from 15-48%. Recent news has mentioned that the hedge funds and banks are letting go of their Chinese holdings but I believe this is a great buying opportunity strictly due to the low prices and Munger's new position.¬†

Most of them still have pretty high analyst PT's but their P/E's and P/S's stick out like a sour thumb. All of these companies are stuck below the 42 zone on the RSi and show massive growth for the EPS. Being able to pay off any debts and having Jack Ma, the idiot who spoke against a communist government finally out from CEO of BABA, may now let us see the only upside potential we've been waiting for. BTW, hearing Munger's opinion on Jack Ma's actions and him stepping down seriously makes me believe BABA is a gold mine with purchasing LEAPS.¬†Much more of a safer bet with him out of the eqaution. 

I still have a great interest in these companies and want to hear some of your opinions on this. I did purchase today 600 shares of $IQ @ 18.54 to add a new stock into my portfolio with me already having LEAPS on BABA and a decent amount of money in JD @ 84 per share. Even though the hedge funds and banks are dumping their stakes, I believe it has the potential to make solid, big gains.¬†"

2021-04-08 12:20:46,stocks,">don't fall for anti chinese propaganda.

Thank you for this.  Seriously.  That shit is so out of hand.

If you can't tell that America in particular is gearing up for a war with China under any pretense possible, you haven't paid attention to the history of American aggression.  I mean, the Gulf of Tonkin incident was faked by McNamara's own admission, to say nothing about thw weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

Forget about all of the unsubstantiated or easily debunked claims about what is happening internally in China (Falun Gong, I'm glaring at you), but just imagine believing that performance of Chinese enterprises is largely faked, despite knowing full well that the country has experienced meteoric growth for 2 decades.  How much cognitive dissonance can a person have?  I'm not saying everything every Chinese company reports is absolutely true, after all *all businesses* have incentive to bend or break the truth to make more money.  I mean, look at Theranos.  That shit happens everywhere.  But to believe that the entire (or large part of) growth of China is faked is just indefensible.

America has not planned adequately for its future.   It is getting beat in every possible metric by China except nominal GDP.  Now that China's economy is only based 18% on exports, China holds the cards.  Since American governance is so wildly ineffective, the prognosis is bad for American hegemony.  If we can't beat them in energy, transportation, Infrastructure, research, engineering, etc, the only battlefield left is a literal one.  This is why there is an endless stream of weak evidence or otherwise unsubstantiated claims about China.  They aren't ""the good guys"", but if we are being honest, neither are we.  

We have to collectively stop the insanity, because the US has a history of making massive blunders with its military and China actually doesn't.  We need to take a step back and really think about what would happen if we fought with China.  It would range from being absolutely devastating to the end of civilization....and I wouldn't fully rule out the extinction of mankind either.  We could at the barest minimum kiss our investments goodbye.  There is no scenario in which a hot war with China will leave the world (or even just the US) a better place when all is said and done.

So really think about it: if China reclaims Taiwan, is it worth risking the entirety of civilization so that the government the people of China overwhelmingly hated 70 years ago can continue?  

Is it worth your personal future to preserve a small section of religion in just China?  Do you care that much?

Really think your way through this and see if, by the end of it, you still want to punish China."

Not much different than a SpaceX or Blue Origin and certainly probably more likely to succeed than SPCE. And based on the way things are categorized these days Apple is basically a utility.

ELS and SUI are incredibly similar and it's difficult to pick one or the other. UMH pays the highest yield and even though it's growing FFO/Share the payout ratio is so high that it can't grow it, maybe just keep it at the same level. If you had to pick ELS or SUI, which one would you pick? Maybe both?

2021-04-07 20:09:33,stocks,"I own a large position in ELS, though like you said it‚Äôs hard to pick between the two. I invested in ELS because they‚Äôve been more thoughtful regarding financing via debt and equity dilution. SUI has been ultra-aggressive in terms of equity dilution to expand into marinas; as they trade at a premium to NAV, it makes sense if the acquisitions are accretive which I believe they are. So even as the shareholders are diluted it‚Äôs been a net positive for them. However, I personally believe although marinas may be similar to MH parks in terms of market characteristics, the environmental risk is pretty big. That‚Äôs a big question mark for me though I see that there‚Äôs huge boat demand. 

Where I‚Äôm going with this is, SUI has been aggressively acquiring accretive assets which has been fantastic for shareholders. If those don‚Äôt pan out going forward, or they start trading at a discount to NAV due to a long term bear market or just a general change in sentiment, then the market solution and growth strategy starts looking a lot worse. ELS seems more conservative from that standpoint to me, and they are diversified into marinas and RV parks as well just not as aggressively so. They‚Äôve been balanced in their equity dilution and tend to be diligent about paying back debt as they borrow more, so on the whole it‚Äôs pretty consistent year over year. I would like to see them be slightly more aggressive in terms of selling shares if they believe they have found very accretive assets, but I think it‚Äôs almost better to ask them to dial it up than to ask SUI to dial it down if you‚Äôre trying to plan for all market conditions going forward."

2021-04-07 20:25:30,stocks,"You're reading this because the housing market is currently at all time inventory lows.

""Manufactured Homes"" are a polite way of saying ""mobile home"" or ""trailer park home"" or ""tornado magnet"" or FFT (FEMA Formaldehyde trailer).  I bet you were thinking ""pre-fab"", weren't you?

What people might not realize is that it is almost impossible for someone without collateral, in the twilight years of their life, to get a mortgage over a certain baseline amount.  The average home price has far exceeded that baseline amount and seniors, who are faced with the prospect of subsisting off of their social security, need to find *some* type of housing.  This property class is especially flexible because the elderly are willing to live where others are not (next to industrial areas and on the immediate perimeter of airports and other ""cheap land"" areas).

Trailer park communities consisting largely of seniors are starting to pop up all over the country anywhere below the rust belt.  These properties are almost considered government sponsored enterprises because their fund revenues are fueled by social security (so, if social security ever goes sideways, these funds will get destroyed).  Typically, the buyers of these ""homes"" don't even own the land on which they're parked.  When the occupants of these ""homes"" kick the bucket or become too sick to reside in them, these homes are repossessed, cleaned out and recycled to the next dying, broke boomer.

...and now the seniors are facing competition of America's working poor and illegal immigrants (remember that ""below the rust belt"" part, right?).  The combination of demographic and economic pressures make this type of property a growth sector at least for the next couple of decades.  However, given the sector's exposure to social security solvency, I feel like I should be getting at least a 5% dividend and better than 30% year on year growth."

Gavrilo princip was basically a nobody who managed to trigger a world war with a pistol, a few hand grenades, and luck.

I think even in this world Kratos has a role to play, if only as a defensive screen. Just think about the capabilities a 5-mile wide drone swarm can offer a city like Jerusalem or Seoul from the occasional missile or rocket attack. It would make the levelling of cities seen in WW2 much more difficult and limit civilian casualties. It could give security forces a network of eyes in the sky to look out for guerillas, etc. Or imagine the stopping power just 1 or 2 drones can give a military checkpoint against vehicle-borne ieds.

I said that drones could be used in a defensive screen, given enough time, to protect cities from rockets, slower projectiles, etc. Theoretically you could also employ them at different levels of the atmosphere, ready to intercept nuclear missiles as far away from earth‚Äôs surface as possible. You might have a point saying drones don‚Äôt have a place in MAD policies, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt work with MAD. I think the main concern is actually that they change the risk/reward equation in a way that might actually make nuclear weapons more palatable to use. Dan Carlin actually talks about this in one of his podcasts on the Cold War. He talks about how tactical nukes, developed to limit the amount of fallout as a result of a nuclear strike, might actually make nuclear weapons more likely to be used bc they are so much smaller and less destructive. So if you find an important enemy factory or airfield you want to destroy, but it‚Äôs being guarded by a swarm of 100+ densely packed drones that your stealth bombers can‚Äôt hope to get through, you might drop a tactical nuke first and then go in to clean I up. The concern is if your enemy also has nuclear weapons, how does your enemy know that this is the only one and not just the first of many being used to wipe them out?"

I see increasing instability in the future as near peers (China+Russia+whoever else throws in their lot with them) approach parity in these technologies, especially if AI and robotics take off. I'd be surprised if we don't end up with some form of global conflict, hopefully only a series of proxy wars rather than direct confrontation between the US-led and China-led blocks that are forming. The nobodies will be well armed by the opposing side and you'll have lots of trouble figuring out that side's intentions and game plan. What you see in Donbas is a timid foreshadowing of what's to come.

I have a feeling that regions like Africa will be the first to see some serious testing of drone swarms and countermeasures such as short range EMP, because the conflict over who will control the critical resources of that continent is just getting started. The place has no shortage of political, religious and ethnic divisions and of insurgent groups ready to fight for whoever pays more.

The point of MAD was that strategic missile launch was easily detectable form space, so you could have a clear mutual annihilation strategy that kept the balance. The new stuff is much more fluid, unpredictable and deniable. EMP weapons will be cheap and arming insurgents with launchers can be done deniably. Drones will be available on both sides and they'll wreck havoc on C3I infrastructure except for its space-based components. Take a look at the fun that Russia has with Ukraine in Donbas, that's child's play compared with what's to come from China in 20 years.

When it comes to military AI and robotics, China is going straight for the jugular and we have at best 20-30 years left before they'll try to make a major move. Meanwhile they'll keep pushing against the US in their near abroad and staking their claims in Central Asia, Africa and West Asia wherever they can.

Hard times are coming and Kratos, GD etc. will be increasingly important because of that, but peace will be more elusive than ever in the contested regions.

The only way to make progress fast, is to be willing to fail time and time again. SpaceX, Rocket Lab, even ULA have failed multiple times and have all had rockets come crashing down or explode in mid air or had some other big failure. SpaceX's latest test flights of Starship have been disaster upon disaster. Unfortunately, that is the only way to make progress in space flight.

Virgin Galactic has zero room for error because they have pilots flying it. SpaceX, has none. It took them years to feel confident enough to put astronauts on board. Therefore Virgin's risk tolerance is completely different from any other space flight company.

That being said, it does feel that they have made zero progress since their start and I don't have as much confidence in Richard Branson as I do in Elon Musk or Peter Beck. If I was the OP and wanted some exposure in space, I'd find a different company to invest in"

With the ever-increasing rise in retail trading, especially with how hectic things have been the first few months of this year, I‚Äôve often been at odds on how to capitalize on a stock‚Äôs momentum. Many sites like Stocktwits and Finviz have charts to show you what‚Äôs being talked about and being watched and trending but I find it hard to see how that information can be used in a reliable fashion. It seems common that companies on these lists rally for a day or two after being added to the list, but it also seems common that they‚Äôre on the list because they‚Äôre currently crashing after a rally and the sentiment is filled with a combination of both bears and people looking to pick the stock up cheap because they think it‚Äôs a good value. 

My questions for you are 1) why or why not do you see social sentiment as a good indicator to base a trade on? And 2) if you do use it as an indicator, what other factors do you begin to look at to further determine it‚Äôs a trade you want to enter?

There must be people out there making money off this momentum, and I find it interesting that the more mainstream retail trading be comes, the stronger of an indicator social sentiment becomes.

No he didn't, what? He literally didn't lose any money at all.

If he had $3300 and bought 100 shares of RMO @$33 and he sold all 100 @ $15, he's realized $1800 in losses. That $1800 is now gone. He has $1500 in the cash now out of that original $3300.

Could he now turn that $1500 into a 120% gain and try to get that $1800 back elsewhere? Maybe, but that's far from a guarantee. 

But instead he averaged down and bought 50 more shares @ $15 ($750) to give himself a new position of 150 shares with an avg of $27. He now has $4050 total invested in RMO. 

He then bought ~425 more shares of RMO @ $8 ($3400) to give himself a new position of 575 shares @ $12.96 avg. He now has $7450 total invested in RMO.

He then sells all 575 shares @ $13.60 and now has $7,820 in cash, having profited $370. So instead of losing $1500, he made $370.

If that $7450 was 100% of his port than sure maybe there is opportunity cost worth considering, but odds are he was still able to make plenty of other plays while he let his RMO play ride until it turned profitable."

2021-04-08 00:00:00,stocks,"The Green Correction: Some Hypotheses I've been watching since mid-February as green energy stocks (for me, mostly solar and microgrids) have tumbled. I will broaden this out to green stocks in general (throw in EVs) in general, but wanted to get opinions on which of the following hypotheses could explain it:

1. Speculation Bubble: None of the green stocks have realistic valuations, and are falling back to their value. 
2. GameStop Black Hole: A lot of the growth in green stocks was from retail, which is now increasingly drawn to meme stocks instead. 
3. Interest Rates: The rise of 10 year bond interest rate is increasing the cost of loans, and eating into the expected profitability of green companies
4. Politics: As green energy becomes a partisan political issue, it is becoming a mood indicator for liberal policies in general

I am long term optimistic about green energy, particularly with [solar and wind being cost-competitive (and in most cases cheaper) than fossil fuels](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth). I don't need the money now, so currently just suffering through compounding red days. But I want to understand the source of what is happening, and whether is relates to fundamentals (e.g. valuations are too high now), or technicals (e.g. mass psychology/behavior dragging it down)."

2021-04-08 04:38:34,stocks,"I mostly see it as both 1 and 4. 2020 was a very future-thinking year in my opinion, so the big gains you mentioned were driven by people seeing this as the future and pricing in the growth followed by the momentum crowd. Then the Biden win and some predictions about clean energy policies, but things started to turn when he proved to be focused on covid and hasn't really made any big clean energy moves. I think this is the exact wrong time to be getting out of these positions! We've almost got this virus beat, so #2 on the agenda is going to be making headlines in the coming weeks or months and I still think this is worth that level of attention."

2021-04-08 00:00:00,stocks,"U.S. Market Recap - Wednesday, April 7, 2021 **Dow +0.05%, S&P 500 +0.15%, Nasdaq (0.07%), Russell 2000 (1.60%)**

* **Synopsis**
   * US equities were little changed in quiet Wednesday trading. The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq were narrowly mixed while Russell 2000 was under pressure. Sectors mixed. Communications services, tech, energy best performers. Materials worst performer on chemicals weakness. Industrials a laggard with most sub-groups on the defensive. Treasuries mixed with curve steepening after yields fell to lowest level in nearly two weeks. Dollar little changed vs euro and yen. Gold finished down 0.1%. WTI crude settled up 0.7%.
   * Market once again devoid of meaningful directional drivers. Recent focus has been on reopening momentum, the moving pieces surrounding infrastructure stimulus, the debate about the market's ability to withstand a higher rate backdrop and rotations. FOMC minutes this afternoon seemed to be a non-event and Q1 earnings season increasingly seen as the next big macro catalyst. Street looking for nearly 25% growth in S&P earnings with upside risk stemming from the usual suspects and green shoots, supply constraints, input cost pressures, pricing power and wallet share shifts likely to be big conference call themes.
   * **FOMC minutes** reiterated Fed mantra it will be some time before substantial further progress is made on goals. Still an outsized focus on **infrastructure stimulus**, particularly in terms of taxes. **Yellen said White House plan tilts scales in favor of companies that invest in US** in WSJ op-ed. Commerce Secretary Raimondo said there is **room to compromise on White House proposal to raise corporate tax rate to 28%.** Politico reported **corporate America doesn't like infrastructure plan given tax changes**. JPM CEO Jamie Dimon said **US economic boom could easily extend into 2023**. Sell-side firms continue to highlight **economic reopening momentum**.
   * Not much corporate news. Cruiseline names **CCL**, **RCL** and **NCLH** helped by CDC reopening comments. **RPM** beat but also discussed significant input price inflation ahead. **LW** missed and flagged supply chain disruptions but did note positive impacts from easing coronavirus restrictions. **MSM** revenue a bit below though commentary was upbeat. **BB** boosted by QNX win at Volvo. **SGH** beat and guided above. **SCHN** beat on strong metals demand and ASP tailwind. **MAXN** guided below on supply chain pressures. **GEO** suspended quarterly dividend payments.

&#x200B;

* **Digest**
   * **Growth groups ahead with communication services, tech the leaders:**
      * Growth groups extended the week's outperformance against value. **Communication services** the leader as internet names led. **Tech** ahead with upside from AAPL and services, though semis didn't do much. **Energy** an outperformer as integrated oil, E&Ps recouped some of yesterday's declines. **Financials** ahead with moneycenter banks, pockets of insurance among the better groups. **Consumer discretionary** an underperformer with homebuilders, auto complex weaker. **Consumer staples** lower on weakness across food, discount retailers. **Healthcare** trailed on weakness across biotech, life sciences, and hospitals. **Industrials** an underperformer as A&D and airlines traded lower. **Materials** the worst performer on weakness across chemicals.
   * **No surprises from March FOMC minutes:**
      * The [minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210317.pdf) of the FOMC's March 16-17 meeting (which saw no policy changes) broke very little new ground and did little to illustrate any large divide within the committee or anything notable about the timing of removing any accommodation. Participants were upbeat on the accelerating economic recovery and better Covid vaccine and case trends, though some voiced concerns that highly accommodative financial conditions could lead to excessive risk-taking and building financial imbalances. Members generally anticipated nearer-term inflationary pressures would be transitory, though there was also some attention to rising market-based inflation measures. Participants agreed that the economy remained far from the Fed's longer-run goals and that current guidance for rates and asset purchases was serving the economy well. A number emphasized the importance of clear communications well in advance of any policy moves.
   * **Infrastructure stimulus headlines continue to shift toward taxes:**
      * Taxes continue to get the bulk of the attention when it comes to infrastructure stimulus given implications for both reconciliation and earnings. Fed Chair Yellen said in a [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-better-corporate-tax-for-america-11617813355?mod=hp_opin_pos_1) op-ed today that the White House tax plan will tilt scales in favor of companies that invest in the US, boost competitiveness of US business and help end global race to the bottom. [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/06/corporate-america-biden-infrastructure-plan-479490) earlier discussed how despite its longstanding call for infrastructure spending, corporate America does not like the White House plan. Highlighted worries about raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% without restoring deductions scrapped in the 2017 overhaul. Global minimum tax flagged as potentially the biggest area of concern. However, Commerce Secretary Raimondo today suggested there is room to compromise White House plan to raise corporate tax rate to 28% ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-taxes/commerce-chief-raimondo-says-there-is-room-for-compromise-on-biden-tax-proposal-idUSKBN2BU2P9)).
   * **Fedspeak includes more commentary on patient stance amid pandemic recovery:**
      * **Chicago Fed President Evans** (voter) said the Fed's employment target will be in sight before too long, achieving the inflation goal will be more difficult ([speech](https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/speeches/2021/promising-outlook-opportunity-community-colleges)); the bar for reducing asset purchases won't be met for a long time. **Dallas' Kaplan** (non-voter) said the Fed would not act as pre-emptively on inflation as it has in the past, but he doesn't want the Fed to fall behind the curve on policy. Kaplan also earlier told [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-kaplan-says-the-economy-still-needs-central-bank-support-11617787800) the economy still currently needs Fed support, but it will be healthier accommodation is removed as the economy recovers. **Richmond's Barkin** (voter) said evidence of inflation pressures are starting to build, and supply chin constrains are now the biggest economic risk. **San Francisco's Daly** (voter) said bold policy steps would help limit COVID scarring, and that the Fed balance sheet is far from hitting any limits ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-daly/feds-balance-sheet-size-is-far-from-hitting-any-constraints-daly-idUSKBN2BU2XG)). **Fed Governor Brainard** said on CNBC the outlook has brightened though reiterated remaining slack and that inflation impulse is likely temporary.

2021-04-08 00:00:00,stocks,"What‚Äôs your thoughts on Teladoc Inc ($TDOC)? >Teladoc Health, Inc. provides virtual healthcare services on a business-to-business basis in the United States and internationally. It covers various clinical conditions, including non-critical, episodic care, chronic, and complicated cases like cancer and congestive heart failure, as well as offers telehealth solutions, chronic condition management, expert medical services, behavioral health solutions, guidance and support, and platform and program services. It serves health employers, health plans, hospitals, health systems, and insurance and financial services companies.

I like this stock for the reason that, it could revolutionise American Health care. The Telehealth sector is here to stay after the pandemic, across rural America it‚Äôs hard to get care and some hospitals have even closed. [Getting Health Care Was Already Tough In Rural Areas. The Pandemic Has Made It Worse.](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/10/07/920587019/getting-health-care-was-already-tough-in-rural-areas-the-pandemic-has-made-it-wo?t=1617829830584)

This sector of society will still need medical care, having the ability to visit a virtual doctor could be life changing. 

Even for people who don‚Äôt have insurance Teladoc is relatively affordable. 

>With insurance, General Medical visits can be as low as $0 (based on your benefits) per visit. Without insurance, General Medical is $75 per visit.

I know Amazon is looking to move into this space. However Teladoc is already established and when Amazon Prime began, Netflix didn‚Äôt die off.

People didn't switch to prime because there weren't many must watch shows, whereas people are buying Disney Plus in droves despite having far inferior tech across the board from UI to recommendation algorithms. In the media business, content is king.

Google Plus lost to Facebook because of network effects. Why switch to a roughly similar platform if all your friends and family are already on FB? If you aren't offering a completely different service to a different demographic, in the social media business network effects are king.

Meanwhile Teledoc... what is their moat exactly? Why would a customer stick with them over Amazon if the later provides basically the same service for a lower cost (which they can because they own AWS)? 'Teledoc' is hardly a household name, so why would Teledoc outcompete Amazon, who can leverage their existing user base, just because they are slightly more established?

There's only one way this technology goes and the answer to that question is going to be, ""yes, of course..."".  If there are consequences, there will be plenty of unedited spawn to carry on from the inevitable mistakes.

This was a reminder of why I bought Berkshire. The stock is built like a fortress. Layers of successful businesses in their own rights (Geico, Duracell, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom, Helzberg, etc), a healthy stock portfolio and a pile of cash ready to be deployed. While I bought the stock largely as a hedge against big stock downturns, it is a growing behemoth in its own right. 

BRK.B bottomed out last year just under $170, which for me represented a ~15% loss. Much better than any of my other stocks did during the covid crash. So it held the line as I wanted and expected.

But realizing that it‚Äôs returned a 30% gain to me in some 20 months is fairly impressive. I think this shows there is real money to be made in safety/hedging plays and that stability can go hand in hand with growth. 

Just wanted to share as I know market uncertainty is a constant and every portfolio needs a strong cornerstone for when the market turns. I also believe Berkshire is positioned to keep growing at a (relatively) slow and steady pace"

2021-04-08 00:00:00,stocks,"$AGTC has me seeing green with their upside potential I want to make a case for $AGTC, a biotech that is researching a cure to a rare macular disease that affects my son.  I will not pretend to know a darn thing about the inner workings of their research but from what I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs very promising for him and millions of other people. 

AGTC is sitting around $4.50 with an average price target of $16 and a high of $35.  According to yahoo finance it has a 1.7 strong buy rating. Their last 3 upgrades were to buy. 

Why this isn‚Äôt your typical biotech... let‚Äôs look at the numbers:

There are only 42.75 million shares outstanding with a 36.27 million float. Insider percentage is only .66%. So they aren‚Äôt some biotech that is diluting their shares to death while waiting for the FDA to move.  Short % has nearly doubled with their short bursts of price increases (it peaked around $9 when it was added to some ETF‚Äôs and issued shares in Feb) for 1.63 million shares to 2.8m or 6.65% of float.  

Total debt from recent quarter: $14.3 million - remarkable for a small biotech

Other positives:

They are in a research agreement with Bionic Sight to produce therapies and treatments for the blind and those with severe retinal diseases. Should this be successful AGTC has an exclusive to acquire a majority stake Bionic Sight

They have collaboration agreements with the University of Florida

They generate revenue from non-profit orgs for patient/candidates and receive federal research dollars

Seven out of 10 of their executives are Doctors

They tout their intellectual property portfolio in every filing

One of their offerings (XLRP) is in dual phase 1/2 and 2/3 trials and upon approval they think it could fund their other offerings without relying on private equity and debt. 

Risks:

As with any biotech they may never become profitable.

They will need more funding until XLRP gets FDA approval.  The latest filing says they will pursue all avenues. They just issued 16.7 million shares at ironically, today‚Äôs closing price back in February. The stock actually took off on that offering. 

As with every Biotech they could fail their trials. My counter to this is they don‚Äôt have all of their eggs in one basket. 

The timeline is long. They expect key results in 2022 and 2023 but say they will continue to present their data at investor conferences and biotech conventions to gin up interest and investment. 

My position:

7500 shares at $4.18. Didn‚Äôt consider selling at $9 per share because like I said before, this is personal. I‚Äôd love to see them get a breakthrough and fix my son‚Äôs eye.  I sold my NVTA profits in Feb (bought in at $11, sold at $52), another genetics company to buy into this one. 

TL;DR:  AGTC is a strong upside speculative biotech with several offerings in the pipeline, strong buy ratings, not terribly diluted, and isn‚Äôt in debt up to their eyeballs (pun intended)

I believe and this is NOT financial advice or anywhere near the quality of DD I did on AGTC, but I think the market has no idea where all of GME‚Äôs shares are. The FTD (fail to deliver) numbers are staggering and the numbers aren‚Äôt accounting for the float.  It‚Äôs a powder keg sitting on the market. Their BETA is heavily inverse to market performance. Meaning this thing can do some serious damage in a number of ways that I encourage anyone to research.

Edit:  a short squeeze doesn‚Äôt require over 100% shorted shares. It requires a substantial ownership of shares that are unwilling to sell to shorts to close their positions at the market price.  There‚Äôs no sense in looking at the VW squeeze because Porsche had quietly bought a huge stake in VW. It shocked the market. What you are seeing with GME is retail vs hedge funds waiting for one to blink. The low volume on GME is downright scary.  GME revealed in their 10K that they can‚Äôt see the price stabilizing until their shorted shares are closed out. They know how shorted they are better than we do.

High risk when you're investing in individual companies on the ground floor, risky market space and highly competitive if any big pharma muscles in.

These treatments are promising, but they are currently only being rolled out experimentally.

In the near future (5 years), I can't see this type of therapy picking up enough steam that a company/companies turns this into a money-maker with any decent margins or growth.

There's still a lack of long-term studies proving the efficacy of these types of therapies...and even if there were...the fact that LSD/Ecstasy are Schedule I drugs and ketamine is a Schedule III drug means there's going to have to be a change in legislation for this to see wide adoption.

Also: even if this were to become legal, it's not like all therapists would just start using ketamine and LSD to treat patients.  It would still be a super-niche thing that only a few qualified and trained therapists could do.

Judging from the fact that marijuana is still a Schedule I drug with no imminent plans to change that, I think these legislative battles will take a decade or longer to fight...so yeah, I'm not overly bullish on this sector.

This is something that MIGHT see wider adoption in 10-20 years, but knowing how slowly the government moves with drugs, I'm just not seeing it TBH."

2021-04-07 20:10:52,stocks,"No.

Pharmaceutical companies without products (only research) are basically just legalized gambling.  This stock has risen about 200% since it IPOed and has a lot of movement.  It makes it good day traders but that's about it.  The time to be in was three months ago.... and then selling today to triple your money.

It's very overvalued.  It's a research company that's currently worth $3B for some reason.  I would wait for the price to half before you even consider jumping in on this.

To put things into perspective.  They filed a patent that provides them 7.5 years of protection from competition in the pill form shrooms market.  They expect to complete Phase 3 trials in 2 years.  The hypothetical best situation is they are approved and have 5.5 years of protections.  But really, it's shrooms.... it's absurd to think that it's going to pass Phase 3 clinical trials without any problems.

This isn't a company like J&J, GSK, or Gilead or any of the other massive pharmas.  This company is too small and too poor to build manufacturing facilities for this drug.  If this drug approved in America and EU for sale they will have to license the drug to someone else.  This model works and there are a lot of medical research companies that do exclusively research and survive off of patents.

So I mean, yeah, legalized gambling... but this one is even riskier.  This isn't a company like BioNTech who are working solidly within the world of legal... this is shrooms pills... something that is still technically banned.

Put it this way, how many medical marijuana research companies are worth anything today?  None, because once it was legalized any claim to a patent for their products was long gone."

Afaik they are used for different things though. MDMA is mainly used for PTSD.

I doubt that being possible with psilocybin, simply because they don't have the same extremly positive effects on mood.

Psilocybin however seems very effective for depression, anxiety and addiction, because it.... well, fucks up your default way of thinking and perceiving the world.

I would also love to see research on MDMA being more likely to cause HPPD.

I can actually answer that: Most of the research we currently have is on psychedelic assisted therapy. Now why is that important?

It is not like you would get some psilocybin from the pharmacy, drive home and trip. The total therapy time with 2 trips are around 20-30 hours in most studies. So you have several hours therapy before the trip preparing you for it and talking about what to do meanwhile (what to think about), you have two therapists being with you while you trip (even though most of the time you lie down and listen to music) and integration sessions.

This therapy will only be allowed with a pure form of psilocybin, not mushrooms. So you may grow and take shrooms at home, but the companies are actually needed for anyone who wants to experience proper psychedelic assisted therapy. Not only for producing the stuff, but also providing the therapy centers etc.

If in your opinion taking the psychedelic is the same as having a full psychedelic assisted therapy, you are right. But that is not what the current research is based on"

This is standard for all psychedelic assisted therapy, for psilocybin in all studies and also for MDMA. Normally, you have around 8 hours therapy before that which prepares you for the trip, in which they talk with you on what you want to reflect about etc.

You also have therapy after the trip for integration.

I don't know of any research studies on macrodoses psilocybin in which lying somewhere with a mask on and listening to a certain playlist is not what is done while tripping."

Total harvest cycle for mushrooms is like 1 month vs 4-6 months for weed, and a much higher yield. 

Weed is also consumed much more recreationally compared to mushrooms. If consumed for therapeutic purposes a person only needs about 10g of psilocybin mushrooms / year. I microdose them pretty heavily and my annual consumption is about 70g. I You can buy a pound of oyster mushrooms (~450g) which are just as easy to grow at the grocery store for $10."

In 1996 California passed a bill to allow for medical marijuana.  In response Clinton threatened to revoke the licenses of any doctors who wrote a prescription for medical marijuana.  You had these dispensaries operating in California doing this but they couldn't ""go big"" because of the threat of the federal government clamping down on it.  You had hundreds of medical marijuana raids up until 2014 when an act of Congress prevented the US government from spending money on medical marijuana drug raids.

So from 1989 when the 8 year THC pill drug patent was filed until 2014 they made exactly $0 on their investment."

THC and CBD formulations are patented as pharmaceutical medicines and scheduled differently.  This means they can be prescribed in a way that is federally legal, in all 50 states."

Stocks traded largely flat on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) hovering near record highs, as market participants continue to consider the latest batch of strong economic data and commentary by FOMC members.

This week, market participants have digested a host of better-than-expected economic data, with the March job report blowing past consensus estimates, an index tracking activity in the service sector reached a record level, and The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 64.7 last month from 60.8 in February, the highest level since December 1983. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its global growth forecast to 6% this year from the 5.5% rise seen previously, largely reflecting the expectation of quick recovery in the U.S. economy. Moreover, JP Morgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said the current US economic boom ‚Äúcould easily run into 2023‚Äù amid the massive fiscal and monetary policy support provided to people and businesses. 

This week, the Federal Open Market Committee have shed light on how monetary policymakers are thinking about the current economic climate. Most important, market participants want to know what conditions would warrant an adjustment of the Fed‚Äôs current policy stance and their thoughts on potential inflation. FOMC members noted that the economy was ‚Äúfar from achieving the \[FOMC‚Äôs\] broad-based an inclusive goal of maximum employment‚Äù suggesting policymakers are willing to maintain their current accommodative stance for the foreseeable future, barring a sharp and unforeseen upturn in inflation or economic recovery.

Looking ahead, we are eagerly awaiting first-quarter earnings season in the coming weeks, with the hope that the reports show corporate profits are growing strongly in tandem with strengthening economic conditions. Deutsche Bank Strategist Binky Chadha wrote in a note ‚ÄúVery near term, we expect equities to continue to be well supported by the acceleration in macro growth, and see buying by systematic strategies and buybacks driving a grind higher. But we expect a significant period of consolidation as growth peaks over the next three months.‚Äù

&#x200B;

I thought that the 2-day settlement meant that only those who owned the stock 2-days before record date would get the dividend. 2-days prior to 4/9 would be 4/7 not 4/8.

&#x200B;

What am I missing here?"
2021-04-07 22:36:20,stocks,"Ex-div dates are set to prevent a logjam of delayed settlements leading up to the record date.

If the ex-div date were the day after the record date (which it actually is in some cases), any sale on the record date or the day before would be held until after the record date so the seller could keep the dividend.

By saying clearly that shares sold on the record date or the day before don't have a dividend attached, there's no reason to delay settlement.  So the ex-div date is (usually) declared to be to the day before the record date."
2021-04-07 20:50:54,stocks,"The company isn't giving you shares unless it's a stock dividend, and that's rare these days. They give you cash, the cash is used to buy shares. They can buy the shares on the market with that cash if need be."
2021-04-07 21:59:44,stocks,"The broker is the one doing the DRIP. It‚Äôs not through the company you own stock in. DRIP shares are bought on the open market, not taken from the company‚Äôs own shares. Companies can pay either cash(99.9999% do this) or stock dividends, and you receive whatever they give per share owned no matter what"
2021-04-07 21:05:06,stocks,"I‚Äôve always wondered the same, that makes sense though"
2021-04-07 21:04:38,stocks,They specifically asked about drip or DRIP (Dividend ReInvestment Plan) which automatically invests the cash into whole+fractional shares at the current market price (I think market price anyway)
2021-04-07 21:18:20,stocks,"Hmm ok, cause i got 37 shares of Lif at 36 each and they are supposed to give 1$ dividend per share this quarter and theres a drip plan."

2021-04-08 00:30:11,stocks,"Some companies do, unless they have all ended dspp programs. I don't pay much attention to that anymore honestly."
2021-04-07 22:42:13,stocks,"Huh?

The stock price is 0.52 lower tomorrow? I don't usually pay attention to dividends because on my other dividend stocks like MSFT they were pretty tiny."
2021-04-07 21:09:57,stocks,"Yeah, I wasnt very clear. Even if they don't have any, they can always buy them back. Someone will sell if the price is right"
2021-04-07 21:31:52,stocks,"Even in the purely theoretical case of zero shares being available you would just keep the cash, so no worries."
2021-04-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Which ETFs are good options right now? I recently started dabbling with the stock market and have roughly $250 in different tech stocks. I know that's not a lot by most standards but I am just testing the water.

I am a college student and have $8000 in a savings account just sitting there doing nothing. With the impending threat of high inflation rates I am keen on the idea of putting some (maybe 3000) into one or two ETFs.

Which ETF do you recommend? Should I even buy into an ETF?

I really like the model of ARKK but it seems like a more risky investment and there are lots of mixed reviews about it. Lots of analysis says that ARKK is too high to buy right now but it is down nearly $40 from all-time highs. 

Other common ETFs like QQQ and SPY are at all-time highs and I wonder if I would pay more money for less value with those in this current market condition.

Are there a bunch of people like me buying ETFs driving the price up past what the ETFs are worth?"
2021-04-07 20:01:15,stocks,"Your young,  think what do you feel like in the next 10-15 years could be huge by then.
I‚Äôm old but my guess is
MSOS or YOLO weed etfs if it goes national recreation in 15-20 years this be major industry
MOON  future high tech in mixtures of areas
BJK  casinos and online gaming more and more states will allow this because tax revenue is just too good to pass up. And gambling makes money for the house. 
ICLN renewable energy long term play
 And then maybe some VTI just so u see some green on the other ones down days and you have a nice safe etf to compare your winners to.
PS this along with many more risky plays is where I put my money. IT is NOT where I put my kids money lol they all safe and boring"
2021-04-07 21:42:39,stocks,"I look at your situation a little differently.  Since you are in college, you don't need the extra stress of getting into more racy stocks.    You have enough problems without watching the market take a plunge and your high-flying stocks with it.  


You should consider investing in safer stocks with a long term timeline.  By safer am thinking dividend paying stocks that are not sexy, meme, or rocket stocks.  It is nice to see your stocks go up in price while also getting love offerings (dividends) from these stock companies.  Specifically utilities and other bread and butter stocks like  that everyone uses.  These types of stocks used to be called ""Widows & Orphan"" stocks since they were very safe.

&#x200B;

With this approach you are in the market, making some money as well as finding out where your pain threshold is in investing, what you think and believe about the stock market, and what the trends are that will pop up in the stock market.  Besides you may find some very interesting companies that will cause you to think more deeply about the stock market.  Finally it is harder to lose money with these stocks.  You can still lose it, but it is harder.  


And for the final benefit.  I do not know of any college student that does not need money occasionally.   With dividend stocks if you reinvest the dividends you can sell the new shares and have some extra money.  Not a lot but more than what you have now.  The upside is that you are selling off your profit and not touching your principal."

2021-04-07 22:29:07,stocks,"I would learn about beta, tracking, turnover and spread. ER is bad metric to invest with ETF. VTI has an 8% turnover ratio and increasing each year. VT follows a bad index and excludes a lot of emerging nations like south Korea, Taiwan and Nigeria. Not to mention vti is basically an sp500 fund these days. It is no longer following its original goal of a total market exposure. This sub can be dogmatic to the point you will be underperforming from bloated total market funds. Jack Bogle said index funds were getting to big and that was a problem. Research more about which etf you want and what are your goals."

2021-04-08 19:24:58,stocks,"New to this, so please bear with my stupid question(s)...

Do ETFs publish the companies they invest in or do they just invest in a ""sector""?

If they do publish the list, would you be better off buying those companies yourself and avoiding any fees associated with the ETF maintaining the fund?

Totally ignorant over here. I just see more and more people advising to simply buy ETFs instead of individual stocks hoping you pick the right winners and avoid the right losers."

2021-04-08 12:30:33,stocks,"This is solid, low-risk advice. 

however, if you want to get rich, YOLO on some high risk stocks and go all in. With less than $1,000, you don't have anything to lose. Turn that $1,000 into $10,000 and then buy options and turn it into $100,000, and then $1M and then $10M. You could be insanely wealthy by 26. This was my path, I took $5,000 and bought a few risky tech names. Turned that into $600 in about 3 months and then worked for 25 years, but now it's all good!"

The 5 yr return on SPY is 16.48% vs 9.55% on SPDY.
Granted if you're reinvesting those dividend back into stocks that's great.

I don't think there's anything wrong SPDY myself. I have a small percentage of high dividend ETFs solely to help keep buying stocks.

2021-04-08 04:09:08,stocks,"I would disagree about taking more risks at his age.  That is generally true, but he does not have a high degree of savings.  $8000 is nothing if he wants to think about any serious purchases in the near future, or if he wants to move out on his own and his work situation isn't stable.   The problem is if stocks dip, say, 30% and that $8000 becomes $5600.  Is he OK with losing that much in the short-term?

Risks at his age are good but I would encourage /u/wiggle-le-air to think about how much of his money he is willing to see go down.

If he is worried about inflation there are other alternatives which I am happy to touch on if anyone asks."

2021-04-08 07:40:44,stocks,Blame MiFID2. Brought to you by the same sort people that recommend you invest with them for a solid 2% annual return.
2021-04-08 14:12:04,stocks,"So that‚Äôs something that only he can answer if he can afford such volatility. From what I gather it‚Äôs that he probably wants to do some what a buy it and leave it type ordeal (which I am only interpreting) . But that‚Äôs just a part his portfolio. 

If he saves up a bit more then he can diversify and actually invest rather than doing only etfs. Again. Not giving any advice or a financial advisor. I‚Äôm only making observations and guesses here. 

My perspective it‚Äôs that any money he puts into a etf he really isn‚Äôt making any money on but rather it‚Äôs just a way for him to beat inflation so that his money doesn‚Äôt become completely devalued. Once he has put some more money saved up into actually buying and selling stocks making a few losing plays then he can begin understand how much he can mentally and financially he can risk. 

Like I‚Äôve said in my previous comment. There are zero promises that the stock market will constantly go up and not crash or bust. It‚Äôs a casino that he is trying to come into. 

Again. As long as OP does his own research and DD while actually going to speak to a financial advisor at his local banking institute then he can be better prepared for it.

And one thought for OP. Consider Paying down your student loans first before anything else. It might be tempting just to put all your money into the market ASAP. But if you can take care of your debt first it‚Äôll be to your benefit in the long run. You don‚Äôt want to be that person in their late 20s , 30s still paying down that debt when you can be using that extra cash buying more investments or even making your first home purchase."

2021-04-08 18:13:35,stocks,"Hey there.  Of course only he knows what his financial situation and needs are.

I don't think putting money into an ETF (say, VOO) is just a way to beat inflation.  That's actually one of the most steady, most profitable investments you could make, historically speaking.

If he simply wants to keep up with or beat inflation, there are better ways that involve less risk."

A mixture of disgust and anger (probably from those who got sucked into buying it at the 10+ price on Jan 26), disdain and despondency from several others. As a technical analyst, the last 3 times that I witnessed such a low level of sentiment was in last 18 months, with KHC, GE and WFC and each of those 3 experiences led to a 80 to 100pct gain in those stocks. Extreme negative sentiment can be a BUY signal, I am hoping for a similar outcome with NOK stock. I would rate make some profits a lot higher than winning thumbs ups on reddit !! I am sure you agree."

2021-04-08 09:17:59,stocks,"Verizon's $244B market cap is twice its revenue and almost four times its net asset value. NOK's $22B cap is *less* than its total revenue and barely 30% higher than its NAV. It's not like Verizon can just expand out into other countries that already have Telecom providers established with their own networks and their own infrastructure. They don't have as much room to grow. If anything, they should be the one with a market cap less than their revenue. NOK has literally everywhere to grow as 5G is slowly adapted throughout the world. The point is, the valuation of a lot of companies doesn't really make sense and is not indicative of their actual future business potential. It's just their perceived worth through the eyes of an increasingly uneducated (with regard to business and finance fundamentals/securities trading - of which I consider myself one of) population."
2021-04-08 00:55:13,stocks,"I mean, it is kind of the basis for the valuation of every single company on the stock market. Obviously fundamentals are relevant to a company's current and Future performance, but the actual value of the stock is entirely dependent on what people think it should be worth. How else would you get SPACs with $0 in revenue and no business plan whatsoever with market caps of $1B+?"
2021-04-08 11:20:02,stocks,"No, it was a bunch of people buying shares out of hype. Why would institutions want to cover at $7?? Point is, a large share count doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs the market cap that matters."

2021-04-08 14:15:34,stocks,Thanks; in the market there is nothing personal. It is all about making a judgement. There are those who buy and those who sell and at the point the trade is executed the Seller feels it is the top and decides to sell and the  Buyer feels the opposite. Only one of the two can be right. Good luck.
2021-04-08 11:04:50,stocks,"My dear Watson...all this has nothing do with the price of the stock. It is simply a matter of demand vs supply of the stock and right now the pessimism is so thick you can cut it with a butter knife. The demand and supply are in equilibrium around $4

By the time the news is out, that they have a product that sells and the news is out in the free press, the stock will have moved up about 3 months before in anticipation.

 Analyst Actions: Nokia's Price Target From Credit Suisse Raised to $4.31 From $4.11 But Firm Maintains Neutral Rating

NOK is on my watchlist but I never put money in it, I just want to see whether it pumps again and might make some memes if it does."
2021-04-08 00:45:03,stocks,"Personally, I've believed the only reason for their recent poor performance was their poorly timed, entirely coincidental association with the GameStop debacle. Nokia is one of the stocks that increased by ridiculous amount at the same time that all of the heavily shorted stocks were increasing. However, at the time, less than I believe 1% of Nokia shares were even sold short. It just happened to be a stock that was being discussed on r/wsb at the time.

The association lead anyone who didn't do their research to believe that Nokia was just some worthless, ancient company that was on the verge of collapsing. Had none of that occurred with gamestop, I think Nokia would be around $6 right now. And steadily moving upward."
2021-04-08 10:04:16,stocks,"Just because it had a global presence it doesn't mean that the market cap should be higher. In fact one could argue that there are more risks involved (both on the upside and downside) as there are more factors for management to consider when operating on a global scale. Yes markets don't always make sense, but usually they make more sense than what retail investors like you and I think. Unfortunately, the market doesn't care what you perceive its worth to be. If it doesn't like it at that price, rest assured it will sell off; if the price is too good to be true, rest assured it will be gobbled up by institutions. The fact that it's not, should tell you something"
2021-04-07 23:04:29,stocks,"NOK's guidance for 2021 is very bearish. They cited price erosion from competition along with a loss of market share from competitors, especially in North America. This is why despite the news of partnerships and patents, there has been no change in the price. It's simply a combination of bad luck -- I'd argue that they are in a similar place Blackberry ($BB) was like five years ago. A new CEO cant change that overnight even if the guy sold off NOK's entire patent portfolio. 

&#x200B;

With regards to Lumen, despite their dividend, are sitting in $33.6 billion in debt while only taking in $21B in total revenue. I dont see much growth for them in the long term."
2021-04-07 23:08:37,stocks,"Nokia has no reason to move. Revenue down, no real catalyst, no future prospects. 

LUMN is literally a shitty brand rebranding, and acting like they aren‚Äôt losing money. Paying a dividend when you have more debt than your market cap is fucking stupid. 

LUMN is a SELL as is Nokia, because they are both dinosaur legacy companies that will slowly wither and die, regardless of whatever collection of dusty patents they whip out or debt they pay down."

2021-04-08 11:09:04,stocks,"My trading practice is as follows. I buy a chunk of shares in the $4 + or - 3pct area and if you look at the 2 year chart you will notice that the stock always moves to over $5 + or - 3pct, at which point I sell half my stock position; then I buy that same number of shares as I sold, in the $4 + or - 3pct region. In this way I am continuously reducing the COST basis of the shares I hold behind. In fact at this point my average cost/share is around $3.20. Try it and you will see what I am talking about."

2021-04-08 01:21:48,stocks,"That usually won‚Äôt happen, unless it‚Äôs some black swan event like covid which makes tech the best sector to invest in. However there are circumstances that speculative tech rise a lot quicker than sp500. It usually happens when sp500 is going through a very prolonged bull market. When investing sentiment is at a high level, people will start focusing on speculative tech. For now it‚Äôs a bit hard due to inflation and tax hike fears. Manchin and some dem senators already made some strong statements that they want tax hike to be halved. The Biden spending and tax hike bill will likely be trimmed and these fears should subside in summer once a trimmed bill is confirmed after senate voting. Of course it could also go opposite and the full bill is passed. That would be pretty bad for tech for quite some time. Right now investors‚Äô sentiment is rather low. Sure spy is at all time high but that‚Äôs just due to fixed income offers close to 0% return. People are forced to invest on some stocks that they think is the closest to a savings account for them. I don‚Äôt think many people really want to stay in the market. If fixed income asset will offer higher returns then there will be a big sell off. Fed knows it and is trying their best to prevent this from happening."

I would say Grab is the top dog for rides, especially motobike taxis (we call them ""win"" here, Thai word heh). Foodpanda, Grab and Line all seem to have good market share for food delivery but we will see if Gojek and Robinhood can make a dent.

Lineman/Grab also support other courier operations though, like you can request a rider come pick up a package and courier it to someone immediately. You can also book a driver to come drive you own car.

So I guess that is a big part of the difference, Grab and Line are ""super apps"" similar to Wechat in China, Kakao in South Korea, etc.
So those do have some amount of loyalty because once you setup payment info and earn rewards etc then there is some amount of lockin the bleeds over in the other markets that app serves."

The others I've never used personally. From what I've read Gojek and Grab were really burning cash for market share in Indonesia, and it was starting to spill into other places, but Grab was more of an incumbent and doing better everywhere else. 

I wonder if it might be sort of undervalued after the IPO because of a lack of familiarity with westerners."

2021-04-07 21:48:12,stocks,"I don't think it's likely they IPO that far undervalued unless they IPO like right now into this market or into the bear market on growth stocks that is likely to follow the next correction.

I think for guidance on how attractive the play will be to western investors would be to look at Coupang, SE, etc. I would say SEA plays are considered very hot prospects so as long as timing is reasonable they will have very successful offerings.

Personally even if the price is perhaps a bit high I would likely jump on a Grab IPO no matter what."

Mistake: You can't max out a Roth then start contributing to a Traditional.  The IRS lets you put in a set amount for all combined IRAs, no matter what type. 

Bad Advice:   Your choice of Roth vs Traditional depends on whether you will pay higher or lower taxes after you retire.  In most cases (including mine) where you are in a lower tax bracket after retirement, a Traditional makes you more money because you get to keep a portion of the govts money you would have paid upfront with a Roth."

There have been dozens of Cathie Woods in the past and there will be hundreds or thousands in the future. I feel like you should know this if you've been investing for ~20 years. [Here's a video on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6HrepdLSu4&t=923s&ab_channel=BenFelix)"
2021-04-07 20:35:57,stocks,"I'm learning as I go and have had the same question. Here's what I have found so far:

1. Investing for Dummies - I hate to resort to these kind of guides, but this one is somewhat worth it as a starting point. It's an 8 books-in-1. More like 8 subjects in one, but it's a good starting point. The section on fundamental analysis is the most helpful. However it jumps around somewhat (and the author of that section suggests to buy the book ""Fundamental Analysis for Dummies"", so you know it's not the entire book in that 8-in-1 book). I recommend this book only because it's a broad introduction into investing, finance, real estate investing, retirement planning, etc...

2. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle. I'm half way through reading this book and have learned a tremendous amount. This guy has a cult following, even though he passed away in the recent past. You will understand the concepts of compound interest AND compound fees. Yes...compound fees, as in mutual funds and what money managers charge. It all adds up. You will get a deeper understanding of index funds and why they are a good idea to have in your portfolio. This book is really worth getting for sure. It will get you started with how to think like an investor, not a gambler.

3. Elements of Investing by Malkiel and Ellis. Haven't read this yet. However I have read Malkiel's book ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" (that was a good book, however I read it in the 1990's and need to read again LOL. Essentially it says everything is BS and you can pick stocks at random and still do as good as the pros. Throwing darts at the stock pages to pick stocks vs going with a pro). Anyhoo, ""Elements of Investing"" gets great reviews and the author's are well regarded in both academia and the real world.

4. Anything by Benjamin Graham. This was Warren Buffetts mentor. I just bought ""The interpretation of Financial Statements"" published in 1937 and has been in continuous reprint. Haven't read it yet but since I have no background in truely analyzing financial statements, accounting or any of that stuff, I figured it is worthwhile. It's considered a classic text in value investing and fundamental analysis. 

I did download Grahams ""Intelligent Investor"" on Kindle and am currently on Chapter 4. As far as I can tell, this book gives the reader a real fundamental understanding of the stock market as a whole and it's history of the ""ups and downs."" BTW the stock market in the US has been more ""up"" than ""down"". Knowing this info helps put investing in perspective. This book is highly regarded and I would not ignore it.

5. If you are like me, I have never taken an accounting class or a finance class. No problem because you can pick up Accounting and Finance books at used book stores and thrift stores. And by books, I'm talking about college textbooks. The kind that cost $150 when you go to college, but cost only $2-$5 in the real world. These are good references to have to double check if a formula you are using is correct or if your approach to something is correct.

I hope this helps. There's alot of books out there on investing. Some of which border on the ""fad diet"" books or the ""get rich quick"" schemes. Just filter out the noise and go for the really helpful books that don't want to sell you something."

2021-04-07 23:26:42,stocks,See if your company does a 401K and a match. Company match is literally free money and it blows my mind that plenty of people still don‚Äôt take advantage of it.
2021-04-07 20:16:56,stocks,"401k often gets split up when talking about priority of where money should go first. First priority is contributing enough to get the full match from your employer (if they offer one) because it's free money. Then maxing out an IRA is next because, ignoring the company match of a 401k, an IRA is better because you have the freedom to chose your investments and fees and all that whereas 401k will have a limited selection of investment options. Then once IRA is maxed out, you should max out the rest of your 401k."
2021-04-07 20:46:34,stocks,"I agree, but that won't guarantee you happiness.

2021-04-07 21:47:18,stocks,Well said! This is exactly right. I try to explain it to my students using this football analogy. Have you ever seen a football player lie on his back in the middle of a game and pump his arms up and down? Have you ever seen one pull out a whiteboard and draw circles and lines? No. Does that mean his coach is crazy for making them bench press during weights or study plays on a whiteboard during practice? No! The coach is teaching them strategies and helping them develop the muscles that will improve their game. School is the same! School helps kids develop the muscles and learn the strategies that will help them in so many different areas of life.

2021-04-07 21:11:23,stocks,Thanks. So as for maxing the rest of my company‚Äôs 401k you guys mean just having them take out more from my checks until it hits the max? Will they auto stop when it hits max? I think this is the part that confuses me. Right now I just have them pull the max % they match.

2021-04-07 21:49:54,stocks,"Whether or not they stop when you reach the max is something you would have to ask your 401k provider or actually maybe your payroll department? I doubt they would stop you from over contributing though.

 I've always specified a percent of my salary to contribute to my 401k that will add up to just under the max 19,500 for the year (or whatever amount I intended to contribute that year) and don't worry about if I miss it by a few hundred bucks."

2021-04-08 09:45:52,stocks,"ROFL, your example shows 100% you do not know how SS works. 

Although it shows a bit more understanding of  Ponzi schemes than I gave you credit for.  

It's not ""perceived"" misunderstanding, it is actual misunderstanding. 

While this will be the last convo I ever have with you (you are not educated, intelligent, or humourous and will never provide a positive impact to a conversation or my knowledge base so you have no worth or value to my Reddit needs) there are many significant differences. 

1)Opacity. Ponzi schemes are financially opaque so users cannot understand the underlying economics. SS is transparent and you can look at inflow/outflow and forecast it appropriately. 

2) Ponzi schemes are built such that the return they promise are not sustainable. SS is fully sustainable. As a matter of fact we have drawn money OUT of SS multiple times, totalling about $2.9 TRILLION dollars. 

If your argument had ANY merit (it doesn't) then the crux of your argument could ONLY be that we have turned a solvent retirement program into a Ponzi Scheme by constantly stealing from the investors of the fund (taxpayers that pay SS). 

You are either ONE of TWO things. 

1)AN idiot that simply parrots what you have heard better men on TV say without a fundamental understanding of how SS and/or Ponzi schemes work (likely case).

2)A member of the ultra-wealthy upper class that is against anything that requires you to pay taxes. You oppose SS because it affects your bottom line (unlikely as if you were in the billionaire class, you would be able to make your argument far more enticing instead of the 3rd grade A,B,C example showing your lack of education and understanding). 

You can respond for the sake of others if you chose."
2021-04-08 00:32:59,stocks,"They were very good in the past. Over the years, new contracts are negotiated and its always less benefit to new employees. Such as increasing employee contribution while decreasing benefits.

I personally would rather take a 401k match because you get the money every paycheck to invest. When you retire, you have full control of the funds distribution.

To make a pension worthwhile, you should put 20+ years of service. You also have to live long enough through retirement to make back your contributions."

Estimates say it would only be about 4-10 years to recover from such a solar storm with improvements and more availability to tech slowly growing in the interim so we're not looking at such a long time that a company like apple could not survive.

2021-04-07 21:42:04,stocks,"Maybe something worth noting, but you didn't mention any deflationary pressures. Something I don't think is talked about enough. Automation and lack of wage growth significantly contribute to lack of inflation. If you look at a chart of productivity growth over the past few years, we have hovered around 1% productivity growth. However, during the peak of the pandemic in the summer of 2020 the US recorded 4+% productivity growth. An incredible increase during the midst of a global health crisis. Is this attributable to automation? Who knows for sure, but increased automation will continue to fight against any inflationary pressures. Not to say there isn't a chance inflation gets out of hand, but I, personally, don't forsee inflation getting out of hand any time soon as we were barely able to make 2% pre pandemic at ""full employment""."

Defaults from renters have been rather low, although there has been notable movement from people choosing outer regions for more space.  As for the US you probably have more access to info than I do, but from what I‚Äôve read, LA house prices have gone up 24% in the last 12 months and inventory is low and extremely competitive to acquire.  I guess a crash would be a boon to every one who is dying to get into the LA market but can‚Äôt afford to do so. Buffalo and Rochester NY housing prices have also increased and suffers from a lack of supply.  

I see how non-payment from renters and people being behind on their mortgage could make you bearish though.  5.8% of Americans are behind on their mortgage as of Dec 2020, and lots of renters behind on their rent. I guess it remains to be seen whether or not that 5.8% could trigger a major housing correction or if that number will spike if and when no more relief is given by the Feds!

Don't get in the habit of eating out all the time or drinking in bars every single weekend. I knew young people in the military who lived in the barracks, only bill was their cell phone and still found a way to spend all their pay like this.

That‚Äôs why they say invest as much as you possibly can while you‚Äôre young. The compound interest over time more than makes up for the difference in wages at the time of investing.

2021-04-08 08:05:59,stocks,"Until you can refuel an electric tank in under 3 minutes it won‚Äôt be happening. I suppose some kind of battery hot swapping feature might work, but I‚Äôm not sure if it would be more or less efficient to drive out huge arrays of batteries to a refueling point instead of tankers."
2021-04-08 08:17:14,stocks,"You can't refuel an ICE tank in under 3 minutes either, so that's a strange comparison to make. Rearming a tank platoon takes 30 min, so if it could charge up enough to be operational in 30 min, it would be good enough."
2021-04-08 15:55:05,stocks,"3 minutes might be a little fast as an estimate, I'm just working off my memory here, but regardless ICE vehicles refuel on the order of minutes (even in tanks) and the time required to recharge the kind of battery required to power something like an Abrams would be measured in hours. Even if you could get recharge time down to 30 minutes, you would need a portable power delivery system that can fit onto a truck and deliver maximum output to at least 4 tanks simultaneously, which is another whole problem to solve in itself. On top of that, not every stop to refuel is a full rearming, so you still would ideally want faster recharge times. Another consideration if you go down the battery swapping route is that batteries are seriously heavy. Having a swappable battery wouldn't be useful if a tank crew can't do it on their own without special machinery.

I think that military EVs are a really interesting problem, and there are tons of tactical advantages to EVs (e.g. quieter movement and stealth operation, not giving away your position with black exhaust fumes every time you start up your engine, and possibly simplifying some operator level maintenance), but there are also a lot of very real barriers that need to be overcome first. We'll probably see it with light vehicles and in scout units first and it'll be a long time before it gets rolled out to heavy armor."

2021-04-07 22:21:46,stocks,I think it's going to 95 at least by the end of year but I'm probably being hopeful.
2021-04-07 23:44:50,stocks,95 by end of year should be easy. might even reach 95 this month with ER. My expectation from last year going into this year was $100 by mid year and potentially 120 year end. Q1 certainly wasnt as expected.

2021-04-08 07:38:45,stocks,"Yes they have lots of experience, but a bunch of it is terrible. 

PBI is considered a tech company. Some of the tech inside their hardware is crap, basic crap. Neopost blows them away in design for mail machines. 

Their software packages are terrible for the mail segment. The training for those packages aren‚Äôt good either. 

One of the sendpro models that came out in 2018/2019 came out with a built in router, which was actually some cheap router from another company with an additional plastic case around it that acted as a base for the smaller sendpros. So your new sendpro stands on top of it. Not attached by anything besides a usb chord. 

The touch screens were cheap android devices that were repurposed. They have a webcam on them... someone got‚Äôs hack them for some funny office footage.

2021-04-08 06:03:30,stocks,"Here's the response from Lauren Hill, which sounds like it confirms that that the fractional share will not be turned into cash. It will disappear. It's not ideal but I guess it's not a big deal unless you have multiple accounts and would lose a fraction of a share for each account. It is just the fraction above that last share at the end of the conversion that is lost, so personally I've purchased a couple extra just to get a fraction that was as close to 0 as possible.

""In no event shall any holder of Aphria Shares be entitled to a fractional Tilray Shares (in cash or any other form).  The entire transaction is based on fixed exchange ratio of (0.83831) Where the aggregate number of Tilray Shares to be issued to a holder of Aphria Shares as consideration under this Arrangement would result in a fraction of an Aphria Share being issuable, the number of Tilray Shares to be received by such holder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Tilray Share.

 

Based on how the arrangement is set, it is expected (based on the shares of Tilray and Aphria issued and issuable as of March 12, 2021) that the Exchange Ratio will result in Aphria Shareholders owning approximately 61.2% of the outstanding shares of Tilray, and existing Tilray Stockholders owning approximately 38.8% of the outstanding shares of Tilray."""

2021-04-08 18:38:35,stocks,"Bond prices are still way above their historical averages and are being actively manipulated by central banks via QE, especially in western countries. The assumption is that inflation will increase because of the increased money supply, stimulus and global economy fully reopening, which will push bond yields up along with it as fed bond buybacks will no longer be enough to keep yields low as there will not be enough other buyers as they won‚Äôt want to buy bonds that have very negative real yields caused by high inflation.

There are currently a number of factors which could make this more severe than just multiple contraction as the discount rate for companies‚Äô future cash flows changes (which alone would cause about a 20-30% drop in the overall market if US 10 year yields went to 3-4%):
- Record high margin debt unwinding as companies valuations drop to account for higher yields, which could cause a crash as holders get margin called
- Record high real estate prices no longer being supported as demand falls from loans for mortgages becoming more expensive, and lending contracting
- Lending contracting in general, decreasing economic growth, and possibly causing many zombie companies to go under as they can no longer afford to pay the interest on their debts, or take on more debt to pay the interest payments, causing them to default on their debts and go bankrupt


There may be things I‚Äôm missing, but this bond bubble looks like another major financial crisis in the making, and I am currently only holding strong cashflow companies with nice dividends and low debt so I minimize my risk of bag holding. Also, the high dividend yield of my portfolio will allow me to buy the dip nicely on whatever companies become undervalued from all the chaos."
