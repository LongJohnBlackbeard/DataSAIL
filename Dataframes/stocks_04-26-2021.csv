2021-04-26 19:40:18,stocks,"65 shares all bought in the mid-$80s range here, let‚Äôs gooooooo!

I fancy them for a long-term hold but exciting anyway!"
2021-04-26 19:43:44,stocks,"They'll beat earnings, stock will tank"
2021-04-26 19:33:02,stocks,"When I bought in at $87 months ago, I thought I got a bargain.  I really hope they have good news."
2021-04-26 19:43:27,stocks,Expecting low 70s by next week but will buy the dip!
2021-04-26 19:49:03,stocks,"With all the chip shortages, I think this will be the case. Even with great earnings."
2021-04-26 19:33:04,stocks,"Okay, so the option strike price stays the same but is now for TLRY. The way this works is you get .8381  of you APHA shares as TLRY shares after the merger. So when purchasing options, each option you purchase is for 100 shares of the stock. In this scenario, once the merger happens instead of 100 shares per option, you will now have 83 shares per option (I can't remember if the converted number was different for options, but it's about 83 shares.) So you will then have the option to sell or execute your 83 share options."
2021-04-26 19:36:25,stocks,"Extra side note: $13 put on TLRY after merger may not have been very wise. Honestly either way this pans out I would say the option will expire worthless. They are at $17 pre-merger. I doubt a catalyst is going to make them drop ~23% in a month, but I guess we will see. My advice, if you see an opportunity before expiration to break even, take it."
2021-04-26 18:18:22,stocks,So now both Uber and Lyft out of the autonomous robotaxi network? I guess it wasn‚Äôt so easy to maintain and grow after all.
2021-04-26 19:03:10,stocks,They‚Äôve got to focus on profitability right now. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me to see them get back into autonomous in the future.
2021-04-26 18:55:25,stocks,"It never made sense to me that these guys thought they could just walk in and try to rush a product to market. 

Google has been at this for over a decade. If I'm placing bets on someone being first to market, and doing it right, it'd be on Google."
2021-04-26 19:07:04,stocks,"Yeah man Elon is gonna win this war.
Wish I owned TSLA lol"
2021-04-26 19:11:19,stocks,What advantage will they have over other players who stayed in the space all along?
2021-04-26 19:01:13,stocks,"Well, google‚Äôs waymo is secluded to only Phoenix Arizona no? Or have they expanded?"
2021-04-26 19:29:25,stocks,"Google‚Äôs Waymo has agreements w/Lyft anyway. Yeah that‚Äôs not as profitable as owning a self driving technology, but they still stand to gain from Google‚Äôs tech if they hit full automation first."
2021-04-26 19:09:18,stocks,good news it‚Äôs dippin
2021-04-26 19:30:55,stocks,"That's the same place uber lost their accreditation from hitting and killing that woman. Developing a fsd car is more than a two year project, which is how uber and the like were treating it."
2021-04-26 17:58:33,stocks,"You lose time by holding. If another investment would make a higher return over the same time period, I would sell at a loss to invest in the higher potential return."
2021-04-26 17:56:04,stocks,"I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre asking specifically if it‚Äôs ‚Äúcan I just sell and rebuy when it‚Äôs lower so I can make more than if I were to just hold‚Äù then the answer would be: how do you know how far it will go down? What if you sell and it was at the bottom and now it‚Äôs starting to go up?

If you‚Äôre asking why you should sell, then there are a ton of reasons that can make someone sell. If there is a better opportunity else where or if something materially changed in a company are just some reasons. 

Before you sell, ask yourself this: ‚Äúwhy did I buy this stock in the first place? What changed my thinking process compared to now?‚Äù"
2021-04-26 18:07:52,stocks,Commissions are a down side.
2021-04-26 18:41:50,stocks,"you did well selling, I was in the same spot few weeks earlier, kept the stock and it only went down, I found myself down 43% while my stop loss was initially set to -1% ( a stop that I removed hoping it will bounce back ) I will never ever disrespect my strategy and as wonderfullingeniunity said earlier : remember why you bought the stock. good luck trading"
2021-04-26 17:55:37,stocks,No downside. If it turns rebuy.
2021-04-26 18:00:22,stocks,No downside unless you rebuy within 30 days.
2021-04-26 17:54:17,stocks,You lock in your loss...duh.
2021-04-26 18:23:02,stocks,I always consider this a correction. No harm done.
2021-04-26 17:53:00,stocks,The downside is this question
2021-04-26 18:00:45,stocks,That's what made me start thinking about selling. Thanks!
2021-04-26 18:01:34,stocks,"Thanks. This is good advice, especially the part about reminding myself why I purchased in the first place."
2021-04-26 18:01:43,stocks,Thanks.
2021-04-26 18:02:59,stocks,"I think that this 'lock in your loss' is the reason that I was considering not selling. But, if it goes back up, I'll have the chance to recover my losses. So, I'm ok w selling. Thanks for helping me think this through."
2021-04-26 17:38:37,stocks,There are some pretty fat target price raises here.
2021-04-26 18:15:00,stocks,"I love your posts but do you ever list downgrades? Cleveland-Cliffs had a downgrade today that‚Äôs been all over CNBC and that would be good information to list. Again, I appreciate your posts, try to read them every night."
2021-04-26 19:27:35,stocks,Never understood why firms even bother with raising their price target by $1 or $2.
2021-04-26 18:38:42,stocks,Nice green day today but let‚Äôs see how this momentum plays out.
2021-04-26 18:12:11,stocks,"At this rate no one actually knows wtf is going on with this stock. It baffles me everyday. 

I‚Äôm just enjoying the ride and there‚Äôs no way Would want to miss out"
2021-04-26 17:17:18,stocks,Wonderful news. Happy to hear some real news on GME.
2021-04-26 17:24:01,stocks,How does this help a squeeze? I would have thought it would do the opposite and mitigate it from happening by releasing more free float?
2021-04-26 19:16:49,stocks,"Sending everyone loads of love, the greatest HODL üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"
2021-04-26 18:28:03,stocks,I shorted gme a few weeks ago. A company raising money you figured would decrease the price right? Why are we up 30% on the day then? I'm about to get margin called with the 300% margin requirement. Man I can't believe this stock.
2021-04-26 19:06:04,stocks,I feel bad for anyone that doesn‚Äôt have a ticket on this rocket. Oh well can‚Äôt cure stupid I guess..
2021-04-26 18:03:57,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-26 19:20:17,stocks,Are you insinuating that there hasn‚Äôt already been a short squeeze?.....
2021-04-26 18:15:37,stocks,"Not gonna lie, I'm completely stumped how gme is trading at 190"
2021-04-26 19:53:33,stocks,Another squeeze is not gonna happen.
2021-04-26 19:06:12,stocks,"More stock, price goes up?    It would be the opposite, unless you assume someone is pumping to dump."
2021-04-26 18:42:08,stocks,Why is this good?  Looks to me like RH just sold the shorts 3.5 million shares.  But I'm supposed to hodl?
2021-04-26 18:00:49,stocks,!remindme 12 hours
2021-04-26 19:25:01,stocks,Finally another toilet flushes.
2021-04-26 19:05:02,stocks,instructions still unclear. going to buy more again i guess?
2021-04-26 18:53:46,stocks,i would not want to miss out on this ride
2021-04-26 19:41:51,stocks,"Same, I had probably around 13 shares way back in mid January, right before all the hyping all over the news media, when it was still in the mid 2-digits range. Sold out to recover costs after that crash, but held onto a couple shares, knowing it was the house money anyway, the ride's sometimes too fun to get off lol."
2021-04-26 19:58:21,stocks,"I played calls on this and made a lot of money....but the rollercoaster is too much for me, I will be missing out on this jump but best of luck to you and everyone else holding."
2021-04-26 19:06:31,stocks,Obvious stock manipulation.
2021-04-26 17:27:41,stocks,"You would be correct, however 3.5 million shares is a drop in the bucket compared to the total shares and estimated short interest on the stock. The reason the price is going haywire after hours now is because there is no longer a threat of share dilution and the fact that the offering was done at MARKET value of $157 speaks volumes as well. There is only positive outlook moving forward for GME at this point."
2021-04-26 19:09:24,stocks,Because it's complete. They are selling no mores shares. Now that it's been actioned the speculation is removed
2021-04-26 18:58:20,stocks,"They started selling these shares since Early April by their last filling i think ? So by slowly selling them on the market whith all these micro fluctuations all month long, they were able to add those 3.5M shares with minimal impact on the (possible) squeeze, or the price."
2021-04-26 18:12:37,stocks,"It's good for the squeeze imo because GME is debt free by end of month. This money may not have been used directly toward the debt but money that enabled them to go debt free without risk. Completely speculative, going debt free allows them to I dunno pay out a crypto dividend like overstock.com did and force a short squeeze."
2021-04-26 17:26:38,stocks,You are 100% correct.
2021-04-26 17:46:53,stocks,‚ÄúBad‚Äù for the squeeze but good for the company. At this point GME will not make big strides unless the company improves its business roadmap. So think of it as the ‚Äúlong‚Äù game to get the ball rolling again
2021-04-26 17:29:27,stocks,Prepare for downvotes from the cult
2021-04-26 17:46:49,stocks,"I hate to tell you this, but the short squeeze happened in January. What you saw recently was a Gamma squeeze, and is only possible due to how tightly held the float is."
2021-04-26 19:19:35,stocks,"Sorry m8 but I gotta say that was, in fact, not the move"
2021-04-26 19:26:25,stocks,"Not sure if serious, cause that would be the dumbest move ever (at least for this month)"
2021-04-26 19:13:53,stocks,What was the price you sold at? I thought it peaked at $190 the morning after the announcement.
2021-04-26 19:01:35,stocks,LOL
2021-04-26 18:38:59,stocks,guh
2021-04-26 18:30:40,stocks,Lol
2021-04-26 18:59:39,stocks,Stop disrespecting meme stocks

2021-04-26 19:32:39,stocks,Hopefully you and everyone else
2021-04-26 19:48:45,stocks,rekt
2021-04-26 18:41:32,stocks,"Im sorry for your loss. Im all in invested in GME myself at the moment. 
Unless you read and know how much market manipulation is going on and how much GME is an anomaly you will never understand. 
But i hope your next trades do better for you."
2021-04-26 19:36:49,stocks,RIP
2021-04-26 19:04:02,stocks,[removed]
2021-04-26 19:00:40,stocks,It wasn't the subreddit that did all of that although it has done some amazing things like the Gorilla foundation.
2021-04-26 18:47:08,stocks,Squeeze or not.. This has been cool to see. I'm in for either because I believe in Cohen and I've got time.
2021-04-26 19:25:40,stocks,"No way the shorts have covered, the squeeze is still coming imo"
2021-04-26 19:06:35,stocks,care to elaborate on how you derived that the squeeze is over? asking for a friend.
2021-04-26 18:38:00,stocks,This is the truth.  The shorts got out when Robinhood restricted buying shares during the first squeeze.  The potential for an ‚Äòinfinity‚Äô squeeze is absolutely gone.
2021-04-26 19:37:29,stocks,"That wasn't a short squeeze... that was barely a squeeze, they've doubled down since then and only made it worse for them."
2021-04-26 19:36:53,stocks,"The stock has been injected very slowly all month long, nobody saw it and yet everybody was waiting / fearing 3.5M shares being injected at once, which would have tanked the price, or added some fuckery to the stock. 

Now, it has all been injected, and the price was barely affected if at all, so with that in consideration... Price go up, because there's less threat to expect tanking the price."
2021-04-26 19:09:42,stocks,"The original prevailing theory for many years was that GameStop was a doomed company with its relatively unchanged antiquated business strategy in an ever-growing ecommerce world. 

The shorts bet big that this company would eventually go bankrupt and cease to exist.

Well within the span of less than a year, someone with extensive experience in building a highly successful online retail business has quickly amassed an impressive amount of control over the company determined to steer it in a completely new direction.

And now, the half a billion raised through this sale of 3.5M shares builds a war chest and establishes a lifeline for the team to build on that vision. 

If the company is truly turned around. Revenue growth becomes a thing again. It's not only going to be mainly retail on the long side. 
Institutional investors will start piling in in droves. 

Shorts aren't going to be able to suppress buying pressure once more and more large whales enter the game against their positions."
2021-04-26 19:04:03,stocks,What? Did you iron press the last wrinkle in your brain?

2021-04-26 19:47:15,stocks,Hold?  Buy?  Too many choices!
2021-04-26 17:48:16,stocks,It removes uncertainty and gives Gamestop liquidity to try to transform itself.
2021-04-26 17:36:07,stocks,"This is the most logical explanation for the after hours spike, but I thought the short interest was down below 25%. Unless this synthetic shares theory is credible."
2021-04-26 17:32:09,stocks,I‚Äôm reading the complete opposite on WSB:)
2021-04-26 17:56:01,stocks,"It seems like there are two facets of GME holders:

1. People who believe in the future of the company
2. People who want to sell their shares for $1MM a piece

It's been pretty interesting to watch the pendulum swing back and forth between the two.  Right now, it seems like group #1 is definitely the majority right now.  The group that thinks they're going to retire billionaires after selling their 4 shares have gone straight down the conspiracy path.

Whether any of this still justifies the current share price, I don't know."
2021-04-26 18:54:59,stocks,It literally is. Take a doomsday cult and replace their doomsday prediction with the short squeeze prediction and you can't tell the difference.
2021-04-26 17:59:48,stocks,Who told you this?
2021-04-26 19:33:35,stocks,care to expand upon on how they specifically exited their positions? explain the market mechanism in ape terms pls.
2021-04-26 18:41:24,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-26 19:42:35,stocks,"Sure,  it's not a pump and dump.   LOL.

After hours action is all organic."
2021-04-26 18:33:54,stocks,To try and transform themselves? Try? TRY? They already have! üòÖ
2021-04-26 18:06:08,stocks,"The thing about GME is it sounds like a conspiracy, it feels like a conspiracy, but when you look at the live trading data, it‚Äôs clear that millions of individual buy orders are being routed through dark pools, then shorted on the NYSE in batches with identical volume (one day a block of 37 shares is traded back and forth ten thousand times, another day it‚Äôs a block of 12 shares, etc.) Every trading day, someone borrows 300,000-500,000 GME shares, as well as millions of ETF shares with GME in them. 
 
There are two theories: one, that the whole GameStop squeeze thing is bullshit and a conspiracy, and the other, that it‚Äôs true and this has never happened before. 
 
The first one seems to make more sense, just because the other one seems like it‚Äôs ridiculous. But when you look under the hood? If there aren‚Äôt an absolute ton of synthetics being shorted every day because the short hedge funds never closed out in January, then how else does the math possibly add up? 
 
That‚Äôs what makes it so bizarre and unique. It‚Äôs worth taking a look."
2021-04-26 17:40:27,stocks,"No one can tell you what the true short interest is on the stock, but I do believe there are synthetic shares and that the SI is still high. There is good DD on r/GME and r/Superstonk which I personally don't find to be completely ridiculous that explain reasons why the SI is still high. 

The current speculation to put it simply is that retail owns more than the float of ~26 mil."
2021-04-26 19:24:38,stocks,"I honestly believe it's way higher than that.
I'm never thought myself a conspiracy theorist but I'm putting my money on this one..."
2021-04-26 17:48:23,stocks,"The way I see it if you believe a squeeze is imminent it would do the opposite if they were selling those shares during a squeeze giving shorts available shares to exit their positions. 

If an even more epic squeeze than what we saw happened and the price is 4206.9 and gme decided to sell shares right at that moment. They would slow the rise and possibly reverse it because suddenly they are releasing 3.5 million shares to shorters trying to get out because the only people buying at that point would be shorters attempting to exit. 

GME sold at the market without telling anyone when and where they were selling the shares. So while they were selling shares around an average of 157 dollars. GMEs price was flat or increased.  There is no longer any shares for shorters to count on and there is a ton of upward buying pressure because they ate up the 3.5 million shares without a huge impact on the price of the stock. 

Of course this is some back of the napkin type thinking on how you could interpret the news and why the price may be increasing right now."
2021-04-26 19:33:48,stocks,"WSB is irrelevant nowadays. Mods are bought, shills run the show, and they don't even allow GME talk anymore. Not sure how you're seeing anything about it on WSB ü§£"
2021-04-26 18:39:38,stocks,"Some of us are both. I was a doubter at $15,,,, and 40.... I finally was like.... wtmf is going in here.
I gave a chance I was wrong and decided I was. I dipped my toe in the Friday it ran to $60 and it‚Äôs changed my life in so many ways, more than just money...

I admitted I was wrong at first and thank god I did. I believe in the SS. And I also believe even without this is a minimum $60B company, and 100B is realistic naturally before 2023... the squeeze, IMO, is 100% legit tho too. I‚Äôll be a part of both"
2021-04-26 19:14:17,stocks,"> Whether any of this still justifies the current share price, I don't know.

I don't see anything that justifies the current price beyond speculation. I believe the company will do well, and expect it to be fairly valued at the current price eventually, but buying now just feels like locking up cash that could otherwise be making gains based on speculation that is somewhere between solid evidence and wild conspiracy"
2021-04-26 18:06:36,stocks,Yeah all the idiots that are still spamming ‚Äú100k is not a meme‚Äù or whatever are the ones who have 10 shares or less lol. The ones with big skin in the game are not expecting 10k or 100k
2021-04-26 19:08:21,stocks,"It's not a cult, it's a scam.   Using reddit for pump and dumps.  You have to wonder why mods and admins abide it on the front page so much, and the awards etc..  a bit conspicuous.   They are so greedy they ruin a 100s year old good thing.."
2021-04-26 18:03:28,stocks,"Look. The first one was clearly a squeeze, and you could see covering. Based on the price and volume action.

Now, that last one was a pretty amazing Gamma squeeze lead by large hedge fund investors, but there was no forced buying beyond the option delta hedging. 

And now, it has largely turned into a way to extract call premiums from retail investors expecting a squeeze higher."
2021-04-26 19:35:42,stocks,"When Melvin capital was underwater, they got bailed out by Citadel, and on top of that, Robinhood Restricted Buying Shares that week in January.  They did this to allow the shorts to cover.

Jesus Christ there‚Äôs a whole Wikipedia.

If it didn‚Äôt happen, go argue with Wikipedia and every news outlet and all the facts in existence."
2021-04-26 18:46:20,stocks,It would have gone 1000+ that‚Äôs a fact and that‚Äôs why they had to stop it.  Robinhood couldn‚Äôt afford to pay us üò≠ü§£

2021-04-26 19:13:21,stocks,I can‚Äôt believe people are still trying to tout the ETF theory. Have you looked at how much GME any of those ETFs hold?? Nobody should take anyone seriously who claims that HFs are shorting GME through ETFs. It means you haven‚Äôt done any of your own research.
2021-04-26 18:51:00,stocks,">It‚Äôs worth taking a look.

I am willing to take a look but I have high standards. Do you have a source of data that 1) has a proven track record in the stock market 2) isn't anonymous and 3) has something to lose if they're wrong (for example, SI Partners who provides short interest data and would literally go out of business if people lost faith in the data they're selling)?"
2021-04-26 18:31:14,stocks,"It really is like sifting through radioactive shit to find actual diamonds in those subs. The diamonds however, are diamonds."

2021-04-26 19:00:31,stocks,"My question is now this one : 
Since they added 3.5M shares to the outstanding shares of the company, and recently their 14A told us what the float could be as of lately, does this 26M float figure include the 3.5M shares or not ?"
2021-04-26 18:42:06,stocks,"This is my belief. Gme got what they needed, and they also are giving thanks to us by letting us get all the squeeze money. Extra smart when you consider we‚Äôre also their customer/demo target.. and we‚Äôll be loyal for life. RC is a god damn genius"
2021-04-26 19:35:21,stocks,"Pretty much spot on. While the hedgies were trading back and forth with each other GameStop was slowly releasing shares that were probably largely bought by retail. Genius level move, imo."
2021-04-26 18:53:20,stocks,"You sound like a religious nut talking about how they were skeptical but then they gave their life to Jesus and it solved all their problems.

Actually, there is so much information available on the subject that makes me curious how can the doubters be so sure about the shorts covering.

Literally, the only argument people that oppose the idea of a future squeeze have is this ""The shorts claim that they have covered so it is true"". I remind you that the shorts that claim they covered are the same people who were fined 59 times for illegal activities. Also, there is not one single entity that has to validate their claims. Which is mad suspicious if you ask me.

I would try to find more solid companies that have been paying steady dividends for years (commonly known as dividend aristocrats).  The dividend rate won't be as high, but the companies are a lot more stable."

2021-04-26 17:31:47,stocks,"As mentioned by other members in the comments, high dividend yield usually smells like trouble.

Depending on how old you are, starting with the stable (T like you've mentioned) companies that pay a fairly lower dividend, build that, reinvest until you reach your target then you can add the high yield at the end (most likely when you're ready to retire or already retired)"
2021-04-26 17:52:31,stocks,"I don't really see the point - the company pays you a dividend and then you immediately give the money back to reinvest. That's fine, but it's essentially the same as not getting the dividend in the first place (then you'd end up holding fewer shares but at a higher share price). It's not a good growth strategy; it exposes you to a lot of dividend risk without any real benefit."

Once the pandemic happened, every single one of those companies tanked about 75%.  I'm still down 10-15% on some of those (OXSQ included).  I'm really hoping for them to break even and then i'm going to sell them off."
2021-04-26 17:32:09,stocks,What about Lif? 1$ dividend per quarter with a 40$ share price. Whats your input on that? (Assuming you have time to check it out) thx
2021-04-26 17:30:46,stocks,"Then why not put your money in to more growth oriented companies such as MSFT and AAPL to get a better return with less risk than your current setup? 

While past returns don't indicate future ones, it's pretty easy to see that MSFT and AAPL will continue to grow at a decent pace. You could let those ride for a while and then swap them for slightly higher yield, slower growth companies."

In fairness to the company on this,  I could be wrong on the take as this was found in about a 30 second glance at the info.  I would just suggest if you own it,  to do your DD to find out why this is,  and if it is expected to continue. 4$/ share dividend, 3.55 eps"
2021-04-26 17:37:21,stocks,"This is exactly what should be done.  The entry price might be higher, but over time this is going to be a better option than some sinking ship of a stock that is losing value while paying out pennies on the share price."
2021-04-26 17:52:17,stocks,"Im horrible at research and probably shouldnt be investing but to me, the recent surge in iron ore prices are the cause. 

 Considering they are a iron ore royalty company, their earnings must of had a significant increase in order to safely payout a dividend that high.

They have a long history of paying high dividends and their share price 10 year seems to correlate with the 10 year price of iron ore."
2021-04-26 18:14:25,stocks,"But how do they support paying out more than they are making? Like I said,  no dd on my part.  As an investor,  that would be the question I need the answer to. Maybe it's just one or two poor earnings reports skewing the numbers? I don't know"

Roku probably won't see highs for a while as it's a ""stay at home"" stock and the market has eased off those. I would keep SPY as the market could continue to hit new highs, but these might go through a correction. Depends on ur SPY% of portfolio really"
2021-04-26 18:02:50,stocks,"Interesting, what made you decide to take this approach? Also, do you see any overlap in the 20 growth stocks you've selected? One thing I've done recently is shave off a lot of my overlapping holdings, for example I was holding tsla, hyln and nio up until february/march when I dumped it all into HYLN. 

As for selling SPY, that's up to you. Do you see more growth in your risky picks, do you have any uncertainty? There's almost no uncertainty with SPY long term, but if you have the conviction and patience then I would say invest where you see the most growth.

I recently just did a major rebalance towards higher risk growth stocks that have all fallen around 50% give or take from their inflated highs, and are now in my opinion very close to fair value and some are undervalued if you're even slightly forward looking. I have conviction that EV, Tech, Genomics and a few other sectors will start to outpace the general market in years to come, so I rebalanced down to about 8 risky stocks."
2021-04-26 18:33:38,stocks,"You could just sell the SPY ETF and hold cash to buy dips. This is probably the best method if you don't want to overpay for your stocks.

Even if the stock never dips, you can still find other ideas for growth. Cash is never a bad idea unless you are specifically waiting for a massive correction."
2021-04-26 17:16:01,stocks,Yeah I would buy zero of these right now. If you wanna speculate sell some of your SPY and go into a extremely speculative stock with huge upside potential like a Biotech or EV play that got annihilated last few months but keep it small less than 10% of your portfolio. One I personally like is LOTZ. Heavily shorted to oblivion and bottoming. Huge growth potential too but honestly any high Risk/High Reward is better than these. Everything priced in already.

2021-04-26 18:34:53,stocks,"It is always hard to watch at the beginning because short-term changes cause many things in your portfolio to look red.

Once you hold onto things for a few years, things mostly stay green and you don't notice as much. It is just a constant up and down and you get use to it, but you can see that overall things go up.

Still, if you had a well diversified portfolio, you should be well into the green right now. The S&P 500 is up 13% year-to-date. 

Make sure you're not overly invested into higher-growth/high-risk tech stocks that are very popular on reddit. You want them, but only as a portion of a larger portfolio. If we enter a recession in the coming years, the prices will also drop more than the wider market.

Also, be careful how you invest the money you would need if you lost or couldn't get a job for 6 months or so. That money you want to make money on, but find something safer to invest in.  Market drops and not being able to find a job are frequently timed together."

2021-04-26 19:39:08,stocks,"Awesome job, man. I started around that time too and got off to a rough start for a lot of reasons. Last few weeks I've settled into more cozy stocks and put a lot into VTI and QQQ while I hold other smaller amounts of individual stocks. It's not the sexiest portfolio out there, but im making money and finally ahead this last week after having a couple good weeks right out of the gate followed by endless red."
2021-04-26 19:31:53,stocks,Same.
2021-04-26 17:18:28,stocks,How much did you start with?
2021-04-26 17:10:14,stocks,Don't sell in Reds and don't buy before the correction is pretty much all u need to know besides on where to invest in the first place
2021-04-26 18:55:10,stocks,"As of today I'm up 76%. Sure some stocks are down, but over half are up. I get the feeling some people just made bad picks."
2021-04-26 18:27:47,stocks,You should've continued buying that dip but pussied out.
2021-04-26 17:42:32,stocks,"As a person with a mostly bearish stance on the market, I definitely agree that panic selling for loss is usually one of the worst things you can do. Discipline is absolutely key."
2021-04-26 17:59:58,stocks,"*If you buy solid companies. People who bought Luckin Coffee i Hertz won't ever be green while those who buy MS, Apple and similar benefit from hodl."
2021-04-26 19:26:49,stocks,"same for me aswell, I'm still about 1 % down, but I know in time will green again :)"
2021-04-26 19:02:46,stocks,100k
2021-04-26 17:46:13,stocks,">don't buy before the correction

Ok, noted. I'll know for the next correction"
2021-04-26 19:08:59,stocks,"Luckin holder here.  Managed green, but god if it isn't stressful holding it."
2021-04-26 17:38:20,stocks,So this week $800 or $650?
2021-04-26 18:05:16,stocks,"Nothings changed imo. I'm long Tesla, earnings were as expected, nothing new here at all really."
2021-04-26 17:06:39,stocks,"Pretty great quarter overall. Maybe a little less exiting than expected, but that yoy production growth is still amazing."
2021-04-26 17:21:31,stocks,"Roughly 1160 years of present earnings are priced in, so I wouldn't expect a modest quartely beat to move the needle much. But then again, I wouldn't expect a company to trade at eleven hundred times earnings either, so what do I know."
2021-04-26 18:53:07,stocks,If you're buying Tesla and don't plan to hold it until 2030 then you should 100% not be holding this stock.
2021-04-26 19:33:48,stocks,"TSLA has mastered the art of making money from non core business.  The  revenue from regulatory credits jumped 46% to $518 million and recorded  $272 million proceeds from sales of digital assets.  Contrary to general wisdom, it looks like the more ancillary stuff Tesla does, the better it is for profits."
2021-04-26 18:28:30,stocks,10.4b sales vs 10.5b expected. 438m net profit vs 509m expected. Market share down to 70% in the first quarter down from 82% last year. It will go down.
2021-04-26 19:24:59,stocks,And down 2.3% after hours
2021-04-26 16:17:18,stocks,"pretty bad quarter

q1 rev is less than q4 2020"
2021-04-26 18:20:31,stocks,"i really wish i sold at 780

i'm gonna cut half my shares this week hopefully.

this is dead money"
2021-04-26 19:18:46,stocks,Short sellers created this atmosphere where great news are presented and the stock slide
2021-04-26 16:26:01,stocks,Tesla earnings a total non event. Think the momentum in that stock is over.
2021-04-26 16:21:10,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-26 18:05:43,stocks,With any luck 550.
2021-04-26 18:45:38,stocks,Agreed
2021-04-26 17:33:00,stocks,Mostly sold the cheap model 3's. Not great selling the lowest margin car.
2021-04-26 17:26:53,stocks,"Down to 730 ‚Äúyears of earnings‚Äù now after this report. And if analyst estimates for 2021 are correct (Tesla beat their estimates 4 out of the last 5 quarters), it will be below 300 ‚Äúyears of earnings‚Äù by the end of the year and will continue to decline because the earnings growth is literally hundreds of percent year over year."
2021-04-26 17:43:55,stocks,Amazon did at one point. I think that it's overvalued but just looking at the pe ratio is pretty shallow.
2021-04-26 19:44:17,stocks,To no one's surprise.
2021-04-26 16:41:11,stocks,Automotive industry is historically slower in q1
2021-04-26 16:18:37,stocks,But the EPS brings the P/E to only barely over 1000. So pretty undervalued.
2021-04-26 16:53:46,stocks,Yeah because they didn‚Äôt produce their most expensive Model S/X cars due to updating the models
2021-04-26 16:18:39,stocks,Still a beat
2021-04-26 17:51:15,stocks,"Yeah, never mind that Tesla usually drops about 30% in Q1 and the overall market drops anywhere between 10% and 30%."
2021-04-26 19:25:45,stocks,Sell to me.
2021-04-26 18:45:12,stocks,"Just for the hell of it, I wanna see you kicking yourself in a few years...

remindme! 5 years"
2021-04-26 18:40:47,stocks,What did you buy at?
2021-04-26 19:24:26,stocks,"I really want to see this in a year

Remindme! 1 year"
2021-04-26 17:22:45,stocks,RemindMe! 1 year
2021-04-26 17:14:44,stocks,I wonder if we could find similar messages from you in your history a year ago?
2021-04-26 17:06:39,stocks,"I don't think it's over, once the stop drops below $400 or so maybe"
2021-04-26 17:01:18,stocks,"Agreed, the internet fad is about played out as well."
2021-04-26 16:23:22,stocks,Brace for the continued $700 for at least a few more weeks
2021-04-26 16:32:47,stocks,Yep hopefully it goes to $150 where it belongs
2021-04-26 17:34:31,stocks,And margin was up 1% to 26% nonetheless
2021-04-26 18:29:47,stocks,"So? Model 3's have 20%+ margin and Model Y has caught up to 3 atleast in Shanghai. Model 3 is now the best-selling premium sedan in the world, so how is that ""not great""?"
2021-04-26 17:39:26,stocks,Not worth reasoning with these folks tbh. Save your time and effort.
2021-04-26 17:54:21,stocks,One ought to look at a lot more than just the P/E ratio. But a P/E north of a thousand is worth taking notice of.
2021-04-26 17:49:24,stocks,AMZN was valued at over a 3000 PE ratio in just 2012. Even Tesla can't say they've achieved that one.
2021-04-26 17:24:11,stocks,I thought Tesla wasn‚Äôt a car company?
2021-04-26 16:59:12,stocks,"Trailing 12 month GAAP EPS is $1/share, so P/E is actually ~720, down from 1,153 before this report. It will keep going down to <300 by the end of the year, with annual earnings growth of 350% year over year expected."
2021-04-26 16:19:53,stocks,lmao
2021-04-26 16:22:06,stocks,"if youre a growth stock with 1000+ PE in the best economy in history, a slight beat is equivalent to a miss"
2021-04-26 16:42:43,stocks,STILL A BEAT LMFAO
2021-04-26 19:27:10,stocks,Above 780

2021-04-26 18:00:15,stocks,"His messages from last year were probably bullish as hell. A lot of the peoples that were pumping it last year sold a long time ago. Personally, I sold my stocks in august when it hit 2400$ to buy more NIO."
2021-04-26 17:25:25,stocks,"Except the internet is real, unlike the idea of Tesla as anything other than a car company."
2021-04-26 18:36:04,stocks,"Indeed. Even without regulatory credits, which r/investing and r/stocks hates because they dont understand it, they are at 22%. And that is with Model Y slightly dragging down the margin atleast in Fremont and S/X lines down. Once both of those are up and running fully, probably looking at 28%+ margins which is quite insane in the automotive world. Especially in EV world, who else is producing them at 20%+ margins?"
2021-04-26 17:47:31,stocks,"Exactly what this guy is saying. If someone speaks of trailing P/E ratios with a company that is growing production numbers by 50% annually while increasing margins, you know you're talking to an idiot or someone who's wilfully ignorant."
2021-04-26 19:25:09,stocks,"Why are you looking at PE ratios for a growth company?

Salesforce had a PE north of a thousand less than two years ago. Again, no one batted an eye because they're focused on growing rather than earnings at this point in their life cycle."
2021-04-26 18:03:20,stocks,"Only if you can't explain how it will go down over a short enough period of time. For Tesla that's pretty easy to explain, so it's not that relevant."
2021-04-26 18:31:54,stocks,"Are you using that as confirmation bias to justify Tesla‚Äôs current PE ratio?

Amazon is already making profits consistently with average PE ratios before that happened.

2021-04-26 16:26:05,stocks,the economy is way past that already
2021-04-26 17:55:40,stocks,"Definitely, but you can't look at a company's past performance to judge their current valuation when their future is showing a 50% annual growth with increasing margins without being an idiot."
2021-04-26 16:28:07,stocks,You must be mixing up the market vs the actual economy. Try again.
2021-04-26 16:32:15,stocks,the market is way past that already
2021-04-26 15:52:14,stocks,"The first thing I would do is look at the holdings in your ETFs to see if you have some that are essentially the same.

The next thing I'd do is look at distributions and expense ratios.  If you're going to consolidate, sell off the ones that are more expensive or pay out less each year.

Some ETFs that I own and like:

* VOO - tracks S&P500
* VO - midcap stocks
* CGW - water utilities
* QCLN - clean energy
* QQQJ - tracks 'next generation' stocks (the ones outside the top 100 in Nasdaq)"
2021-04-26 18:14:43,stocks,"Index following ETFs are usually the most stable growers year after year.

industry specific ETFs will grow and stagnate as they seem to have seasons during the year."
2021-04-26 15:48:53,stocks,Depends which asset classes you want to cover. One could be enough for stocks for example
2021-04-26 16:24:58,stocks,You can get all the diversification needed from one all world etf. Or you can pick a US etf and an global ex us. Beyond that would just be overweighting a sector or theme like green energy or materials etc.
2021-04-26 15:51:48,stocks,Probably just VTI or VOO as a form of diversification. Good long term plays.
2021-04-26 16:07:31,stocks,"right now close to 50% of my portfolio is spread around ETFs, I'm working on getting that down to half. For the long term, ICLN & TAN are great choices. The world is ready to go full speed ahead with renewable and clean energy."
2021-04-26 16:20:29,stocks,"Some people are happy with holding QQQ and VTI only but if you really want to diversify for long term, try something like:

Commodity 5%,

Bond - developed market 30%,
Bond - emerging market 10%"

2021-04-26 16:01:08,stocks,"I assume you mean SoFi, in which I would recommend that."
2021-04-26 16:17:59,stocks,Fidelity is probably the best overall brokerage. So stick with that.
2021-04-26 16:51:17,stocks,Fidelity
2021-04-26 16:05:06,stocks,I just started on the market a few months ago. I use Fidelity and love it. Super easy to use great features and awesome customer service. Highly recommend Fidelity.

2021-04-26 16:00:22,stocks,"You're right that theoretically this should happen, but in practice it often doesn't (in the medium term) - (there are some academic papers on it you can look up). The general idea is that dividends are typically priced in. Once they're declared the stock kind of readjusts itself. Secondly make sure that you're talking about the ex-date and not the payment date. The payment date and declaration date don't matter.   


You're also assuming that the stock doesn't move for other reasons between close and open. If you're in a stock long term I wouldn't time your purchases for the dividend."
2021-04-26 15:42:03,stocks,"You know it goes down on the day the dividend is assigned, not the day it is paid, right?"
2021-04-26 15:31:29,stocks,$1 dividend > $0 dividend
2021-04-26 15:39:42,stocks,"the money to pay the dividend comes from the company's cash reserve, not from the share price itself. however the market usually reacts to it as such."
2021-04-26 16:29:24,stocks,If dividends were the only factor affecting the stock price then you‚Äôd be correct. Of course that‚Äôs not the case.
2021-04-26 15:29:40,stocks,If you waiting for a 1$ dividend i don‚Äôt think stock trading is for you m8
2021-04-26 16:06:11,stocks,Also this is for ordinary dividend - if a stock is paying some massive special dividend you‚Äôll definitely see that price change in the stock
2021-04-26 16:54:31,stocks,"No i didnt know, so not the ex date or pay date but the day they announce it?"
2021-04-26 16:19:37,stocks,"True, but the stock price still gets reduced afterwards by the same amount"
2021-04-26 15:49:43,stocks,How do you misunderstand a simple question so hard
2021-04-26 15:57:27,stocks,Well that's not true at all.
2021-04-26 16:53:18,stocks,"Yeh i dont plan on trading, just holding."
2021-04-26 17:20:50,stocks,Not the day they announce it; the day they assign it. The ex-dividend day.
2021-04-26 17:28:40,stocks,Mmk thats not what i thought thx
2021-04-26 14:36:56,stocks,"At investment companies they would be called lots. As an individual investor I don't normally make that distinction but if I did I would use the term ""lot""."
2021-04-26 14:41:12,stocks,"Blocks are generally 10,000+ shares. In your scenario you would own two positions. 

Allocation refers to the process in which you decide to set up your portfolio. Perhaps allotment is a better term for your case."

2021-04-26 15:14:39,stocks,2 positions or one position since it‚Äôs the same stock ? I would say 1 position on AMD with average stock price X
2021-04-26 14:41:51,stocks,So which is better - 'position' or 'lot'?
2021-04-26 14:33:16,stocks,Yeah I figured 'tranche' is more related to high finance than individual stock buys. For my own personal tracking I call them 'tranche' but I'd like a better term.
2021-04-26 14:44:48,stocks,I refer to individual purchases as lots and the collective (multiple buys of the same security at different prices) as positions.
2021-04-26 14:55:24,stocks,"Ranging 15% above and below an average price level is not what I'd call flat. 

Regardless, I'd just set a standard price alert when the price hits the low range and go long."

2021-04-26 15:04:22,stocks,"I don't know why the top comments are acting like what you are asking for is magic. Regardless, I dont know any tools, something you would have to build yourself."
2021-04-26 14:36:51,stocks,"I don‚Äôt know if there is anything in particular that does this. You have to do your own work, most likely. Run your screen, look at charts, and decide what to buy?"
2021-04-26 14:43:32,stocks,"If you think there's some magical tool that will tell you 100% of the chance something was going to make you money, then I have some snake oil to sell you."
2021-04-26 15:37:52,stocks,I saw this thread and immediately thought of Amazon.
2021-04-26 16:30:04,stocks,"You'll have to play around with it, but...

X% below 52-wk high

X% above 52-week low

(These parameters make sure it's in some kind of middle range...not tanked, plenty of upside to move.)

Then...
Positive daily price change

Daily volume higher than average

(These parameters kind of select for things moving in the right direction.)

Then...
X% above or below some X-period moving average.

(This parameter selects for sideways trading...the longer it trades sideways, the longer the period of the moving average it will start to converge on.)

This will still only get you in the ballpark."
2021-04-26 17:47:21,stocks,"Generally, an upward tick after sideways action is not indicative of a breakout. Transient action from day to day is pretty much random unless news hits, and by the time you get it, the reaction in the market has already manifest.

If you want to hold a stock that has the potential to breakout, you're probably best served finding companies that for whatever reason are being neglected when they have a chance to make some splash in the future. If the splash happens, you'll have your breakout."
2021-04-26 18:40:54,stocks,Look up TTM squeeze on YouTube.  This is the indicator people use to identify breakouts.
2021-04-26 14:21:00,stocks,"what the fuck kind of source is ""Traders"""
2021-04-26 14:28:21,stocks,"I'd be surprised if this happens since Bezos is known to disfavor stock splits, but if they actually want to join the DOW, it will be necessary. The only reason I'd care is if my shares rocket to the moon as Apple and Tesla did after they announced a stock split. To join the DOW, you'd think they'll need to do at least a 10 to 1 split or more"
2021-04-26 14:43:00,stocks,"And anonymous ""traders"" just made a ton of money as the stock jumped on this tweet based on anonymous traders."
2021-04-26 14:03:38,stocks,Is this why it shot up $70 about 15 minutes ago?
2021-04-26 17:12:29,stocks,"I was just told by a ***trader*** that Bezos is such a buff alpha now that he's going to do a reverse split... For every 10 shares you have you'll get 1 back at \~$34,000.

This is solid guys, a trader told me."
2021-04-26 14:42:12,stocks,Bezos just doesn't like it. When he's stepping back it could be a possibility for sure. I don't think it will happen before then
2021-04-26 14:08:56,stocks,I remember during the summer when Apple‚Äôs stock shot up on news of the split and eventually came back down. I have a feeling that the same thing will happen if Amazon splits

Calculation: 53m (shares he owns) * 60 ($ price increase per AMZN share)"
2021-04-26 16:12:28,stocks,I would be betting more on a breakout on earnings then a potential stock split. It‚Äôs topped out here 3 times so it‚Äôs either gonna fail again or breakthrough and my guess is upside though if they did announce it I bet it runs 20% before they split. Gonna be fun either way. I‚Äôm a longterm HODL since 2016 myself. That was my last add.
2021-04-26 14:25:27,stocks,hopefully its a massive split so i can finally sell puts on it
2021-04-26 14:09:42,stocks,I‚Äôm surprised by this....thought it would never split. Glad I‚Äôve been holding these 7 shares...finally a nice jump in the stock price.

But every financial analyst will say a stock split gives you no more ownership in the company and does not affect value.

2021-04-26 14:46:07,stocks,"The Dow is price-weighted rather than market cap-weighted. Adding Amazon at $3400/share would have a significant impact on the Dow. Apple split last year in part because at $460 or whatever it was, it was weighing heavily on the Dow."

Similar to why it is advantageous to join SP500, once you are in, all those index funds are obligated to buy your stock. Now Dow Jones is not very popular index compared to SP500, but it's still State Street's 5th biggest ETF. I would wager some of it is about prestige too, after all, only 30 equities are in it and generally are ""blue chip"" companies.

Edit: Just as an example. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF ($DIA) owns 5.5 million shares of each of the 30 DJIA constituents, worth about $22b. If Amazon joins the index, this fund (and all other similar ones tracking the DJIA) will purchase 5.5 million AMZN shares. But because of $AMZN's high share price (\~$3,400), this would be about $18.7b and represent 3/4 of the fund, so that's why stock split would be required."

2021-04-26 17:58:35,stocks,"In theory there is no big reason for it. It can be a combination of smaller reasons such as simply added visibility via news, or a perception that a split indicates the company fully expects share price to keep going up or they would not bother, and an antecipation of more liquidity, meaning people holding will benefit from easier rebalancing and very small investors that were holding off on buying since price was too high to be able to diversify portfolio can now enter a position.

While a reverse split sends a negative sign (our shares are worth so little we have to bundle them not to become a penny stock) a split sends a positive sign (goodness, our stonks climbed so high we need to split them to keep secondary market liquid)."

I'm talking about the level of preschool mindset that only thinks about how to ring out more out of a stock's price at any rate, even if it's just a stock split.  That's a terrible mindset.  Stocks go up long term because a company has long term potential.   Take a look at GE in the 90's.  The lauded it, and it's stock price shot up.  But it later was found because it was simply gutting costs and moving parts around.  Wall Street/corporate shenanigans to get the execs their bonuses.  Hasn't ever truly recovered. AMZN is case in point.  It doesn't care about stock price, it cares about growth, at all costs.  The stock price goes flat for ""long"" periods because it's not flashy, but then it catches up.

2021-04-26 13:56:16,stocks,"I‚Äôve helped teach statistics at the graduate level and have tutored college students professionally. Your question is more or less how to detangle variance and standard deviation.

I‚Äôll keep this simple. I‚Äôm cutting corners on showing all the math. 

Imagine if you had a small array of 5 numbers. The mean of this array was calculated as X (the exact number doesn‚Äôt matter in this example). 
Let‚Äôs determine how far away from the mean each of the 5 numbers in your array are: -3, -1, 0, +1, +3 (pulling this out of the air for example‚Äôs sake). In other words, one of your five numbers is 3 integers below the mean. Another is 1 under. Another is exactly equal to the mean. Another is 1 above. The last is 3 above. If you had to sum the total difference each number in the array was from the mean, you would get zero. Try adding -3, -1, 0, +1, and +3. But how do you show there were difference between each number and the mean? Well...you can square these differences.

So with the example, we can square -3 to get +9. square -1 to get +1. Etc.
If you square the differences between each number in the array from the mean   and add them together (sum of squares), you found the variance. Variance works because numbers squared are always positive. But this number is much larger than what we were dealing with (Again, look at a difference of -3 becoming +9). The variance can be reduced by taking the square root. This is why Standard Deviation is the square root of Variance. This is why we use SD because it sort of recalibrated the scale and numbers used.

This has applications in stocks for stuff like price and volatility."
2021-04-26 13:40:25,stocks,"Same thing, different units. Variance is average deviations from the mean of all data points. Standard deviation is the square root of variance (like you said)... the measure of dispersion... so if the standard deviation of a set of observations is 10... that means that 68% of the observations in that group are within 10 of the mean (+10/-10).  


I think its just a preference - if you're a finance major you're learning about modern portfolio theory and they quote variance instead of std dev"
2021-04-26 13:38:17,stocks,"> The calculation of variance uses squares because it weighs outliers more heavily than data closer to the mean. This calculation also prevents differences above the mean from canceling out those below, which would result in a variance of zero.

> Because of this squaring, the variance is no longer in the same unit of measurement as the original data. Taking the root of the variance means the standard deviation is restored to the original unit of measure and therefore much easier to interpret."
2021-04-26 14:04:27,stocks,"STDEV is the average distance from the mean.

Variance is STDEV squared.

The reason Variance is squared is to remove the +/- from the equation, because if we just add the individual differences from the mean we'd get 0.

Personally I don't know how this relates to stocks I'm just YOLOing heavily shorted stocks that got fucked up in the pandemic."
2021-04-26 19:03:29,stocks,"To put it very simply, standard deviation is a standardized unit like the name suggests. You can use it to compare the volatility of different stocks with different prices. 

Variance will be influenced by the size of the numbers used. If you have a $1000 stock and a $10 stock, the variance of the $1000 stock will be a lot bigger even if it‚Äôs actually less volatile. A $100 move is still 10% and the same as a $1 move on the $10 stock. Comparing variance here is useless but standard deviation means something."
2021-04-26 13:56:40,stocks,"Standard deviation measures the average distance from each data point to the mean. So if you have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10 that means that on average each data point is 10 away from 100. 

The variance is what you get before you square root to get the standard deviation. So it's the average squared distance from the mean. Since it's the average of square distances it can be highly impacted by outliers because squaring big numbers makes very big numbers."

On the other hand, Rockstar has built a very solid brand over the decades which has proven to be able to withstand the test of time and gather the attention of players of all ages and inclinations.

Also roblox has the issue that since its a kids game, they need their parents to buy everything. Fortnite has teens and adults that play, roblox really doesnt. Also since its a kids game, one big case of people praying on kids via roblox, or governments reviewing how they are marketing to kids and have loot boxes (gambling) and whatnot aimed at kids and they lose a large chunk of their players.

It happens a lot with old certificates you see on ebay. The certificate for say GM is great art but the actual asset was transferred to electronic account. That account after a certain amount of time due to inactivity would have been handed over to the state with a certain amount of time for the owner to collect hence the websites for abandoned property/assets. I would bet your grandparents broker held the actual asset in an account and gave your parents the paper certificates for record keeping/fun.

The stocks bought in 1998 were purchased on July 9th LOL.  Disneys website says ""Record Date"" for the 98' split on June 19th but other websites do show it as July 10th.  I'm gonna assume the june 19th is the right date but that really sucks because it would make a difference between 40 and 160 shares or something like that."
2021-04-26 17:04:47,stocks,">DIS's 8th split took place on June 13, 2007. This was a 1014 for 1000 split, meaning for each 1000 shares of DIS owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 1014 shares.

Why would they do this? It seems like a pointless move"
2021-04-26 13:51:17,stocks,Not sure what to say honestly.  When we called they said there was no activity related to the shares (I'm guessing no cashing of dividends or something like that?) and that legally they were allowed to take it.  Virginia has a website where you can look up your info and see if you have unclaimed funds from the state and sure enough there was a line item for sale of Disney stock and dividends.  I just don't understand why they were able to do this without any notice to my parents who adamantly claim there was nothing ever mailed to them even though the address listed on the stock shares was their current address.  I'm hoping they end up at the very least giving us something from the sale.

2021-04-26 13:58:37,stocks,I know this happens to bank accounts with no activity. The state takes the money as ‚Äúunclaimed‚Äù and you have to file some paperwork to get it back. I imagine it‚Äôs a similar situation but sounds like they sold the stock which may effect the outcome.

If that leads you back to the state having obtained and sold them then I'd look at another route ie

As your parents details haven't changed and are on the certificate I'd be very concerned that the shares have been taken without the correct process.

If the process is you need to fail to bank X dividends, and ignore X number of requests etc etc then it wouldn't be unreasonable to ask Disney Investor relations to provide you with the evidence that all of that process was followed, same with the state.

It seems beyond reasonable that after Disney decided the shares were abandoned that the state could reach the same conclusion.  After all, Disney has nothing to gain from a lost shareholder remainimg lost, but the state has everything. 

It's not in the state's interest to find you, so with a share certificate and your address, how is it possible for the state, with access to the voter records, census, driving license, tax records etc etc to consider your parents as out of contact.

They are a marketing clout away to make a juggernaut run commercially with their Foundry.  In essence, they are just starting.

They do have a lot of challenges ahead.  Growing expenses can trim margins, revenue growth can slow down from long sales cycles, business can be fluctuating from potential seasonality and slowing pace of innovation.  There‚Äôs also risk for  security breaches and hacking. 

Right now short term, they are volatile because it‚Äôs hard to place value on what they have.  They have a revolutionary product which makes them unique.

2021-04-26 13:16:07,stocks,"I have no opinion on the specific stock in question, I am just speaking to your question.

If you have a number in mind put the limit order out now, GTC, at that number.  watch the price action.  you can always modify the order if you think you can get more out of something.

In my life, once I made the decision to sell a stock, 7 times out of 10 I should have just sold it and not tried to eke more out of it.  Especially if I had something else to put the money into that I thought would do better.  In a few cases I got a little more after I was mentally ready to sell by delaying but more often I was disappointed.

Humans tend to undervalue the ecstasy of gains and overvalue the pain of taking losses, especially if you let your gains turn into losses.  But losses are good for tax purposes, so we just need to evolve discipline into what we do offsetting other gains with losses isn't a bad thing and nobody has 100% winning trades.

If their is a rumor and price hasn't ran up then its not priced in!

Basically its only a rumor if everyone knows, sometimes you might find a rumor but price doesn't run up cos other people didn't see it so its smart to hold after news.

I only hold after news if price hasn't ran up before OR we still aren't sure what the news is 100%, other than that feel free to take some profits on the run up, you don't kill your whole position if your still bullish long term, but take some profits and reload the dip after selling the news."

It's funny how you mentioned inflation because this is exactly the way that management is treating the stock. Instead of paying their employees with money, they create shares out of thin air to pay them, essentially causing an effect similar to inflation. Unless they stop doing it that much, the stock price will never climb

As i said, the potential is huge and i am pretty confident that they will grow in the long term. But i am confident that they will grow in the short term as well with even bigger government contracts. I am no expert on political matters but when was the last time the US started a war?

2021-04-26 12:45:17,stocks,Just read the TLDR...but I think most investors are in for the whole year and SP500 is just a good benchmark. Obviously traders who are in and out realize this doesnt apply to them. For people who buy and hold for years SP for 1/1 - 12/31 is a fine metric.
2021-04-26 12:49:39,stocks,"Brilliant analysis, could you extrapolate it over a full 20 years, and then apply the same logic to give an average over those years themselves?"
2021-04-26 14:50:12,stocks,Excellent analysis.  I fear that many overestimate the potential growth of their retirement account.  And the rate of spending too high to last until you need the money ..it's usually 4% but many say 2.5% is much more realistic or even 3%. These lower numbers mean you need more funds or you will have to live on less.
2021-04-26 15:14:48,stocks,"I am not sure how I feel about this to be honest. I think you are trying to answer a different question than what normally is desirable to know. You are answering, what is the average return if I held for one year on an arbitrary date?

While there is a point to Jan 1 to Jan 1is arbitrary, I think it is a really good and strong assumption. This is not due to people dropping money into the market the first day, but because most people will be carrying money over from previous years. Personally I had far far more on Jan 1 than invested in 2019 or 2020. The larger sum earning 30% is more ‚Äútrue‚Äù"
2021-04-26 17:57:01,stocks,"You are absolutely correct, but your point may be too subtle for some people. Any meaningful discussion of average one year returns for a time series such as a market index must model the return as a stochastic variable and compute one-year averages correctly (as you did).

What is quoted in the financial press is generally meaningless and not representative of the statistically correct concepts. In general financial media pushes much nonsense which is demonstrably false or at best irrelevant, but that's because most people don't have the basic understanding of stochastic processes and probability theory that would allow them to see though it. An awful lot of stuff being pandered as advice and conventional wisdom is wrong and pushed because of various interests.

You should be aware that many people who never studied these matters imagine that they understand them simply because they read some conventional stuff from ""investment advice"" sources, so you can expect a lot of resistance even when pointing out aspects which amount to mathematical common sense.

Stochastic process theory is the essence of mathematical finance and the theoretical foundation for the quantitative methods used by the best hedge funds. This stuff goes well-beyond simplistic methods such as the Gaussian linear regression used in ""modern portfolio theory"" (which is not all that modern and not very respectable as a theory if you are familiar with the proper mathematics that should be underlying quantitative finance). I would recommend that you read some serious books on the subject, starting with Mandelbrot's critique of the simplistic assumptions made in the linear regression models which are still being taught in finance graduate programs.

To entice your curiosity, you may wish to think about role of ergodicity, which is implicitly assumed by most Monte-Carlo simulations traditionally used in finance -- even though it is empirically beyond doubt that market dynamics is *not* ergodic."
2021-04-26 12:55:42,stocks,"I guess my point is when we say ""most investors are in for the whole year"" the overwhelming majority of investors are not buying 1/1 and selling 12/31, so why does that specific statistic carry so much weight in the media when it doesn't apply to the majority of people."
2021-04-26 12:53:26,stocks,You totally could! I was doing the math for 2 year gap analysis but thought it would be better to fully flesh out a 1 year extrapolation instead.
2021-04-26 14:52:57,stocks,Exactly. When investing and gauging percent returns it's important to not cherry pick two dates to represent how much your returns could be. You should instead have a large data set. By averaging and having a large data set you eliminate any cherry picked return data (whether it's data that shows +% or -% returns).
2021-04-26 15:30:12,stocks,"I agree it's not what is normally desirable, but I think it should be  more desirable than the YTD number. Your right that most people will be carrying money over form previous years but the movement surrounding Jan 1st could be easily be a spike/dip which then shows a resulting YTD number that's not accurate to the health of the entire year. It's definitely a different way of looking at things, but I'm trying to create a number that portrays more accurately the entire years movements instead of just Jan 1 compared to Jan 1."
2021-04-26 19:02:11,stocks,Wow extremely insightful! You've definitely hit the nail on the head. All my knowledge of math is self taught so knowing there's terms for these types of theory's and information out there to explore more is really awesome!
2021-04-26 13:10:05,stocks,"I'd say because most financial instruments or cycles fit. You have your quarters and can now choose one from where you measure, new year makes the most sense since it covers an entire year of events that often repeat (as in holidays etc, starts off with winter holidays where market is closed super long).

One question: how did you average your numbers? Just asking because -10% and +10% do not result in no change but a loss of 1%. And unless you take data for every single day, don't the numbers you present have exactly the same issue you have with the S&P numbers to be too broad?"
2021-04-26 13:24:01,stocks,"Quarter movements make more sense than the current situation simply because it captures more instances in that year, so it's a much more representative figures on the health of the S&P500. What I'm saying is it's completely arbitrary to choose only one instance out of the entire year to summarize the entire year. My graph [Here](https://imgur.com/a/cNv8OZS) displays two totally different theoretical movements but they both start and end at the same price. Because of this the figure paraded in the media for both of those theoretical years would be 'S&P500 has 16% growth in 2020'. Unless you capture more instances than just one you might as well just be cherry picking data for your own benefit. How did you get that percent for the average of those two? I did take data for every single day, in my disclaimer I mention I took the close data of every single day from each year I averaged out. Since I took the close data of every single day I believe my figure is much more accurate because it compares every single day, not just 1 instance out of ~253 trading days."
2021-04-26 13:32:30,stocks,"I see, but how did you average them together? If it's just the average then it would be the same issue I mentioned, that a day with -10% and +10% would result in 0% for you but in reality is a -1%. Which one is the case for your average?

Of course what you say is true, I won't have a 16% return after 1 year if I start investing at any point, but do people actually believe that? For me this is a good measurement how a year played out.

And I don't think quarter's are a good measurement at all to give a general picture. Each quarter has a huge difference in holidays and events, treating them equally would be deadly for the purpose of this number. 

You could even make the point that a single year is not enough, but if you start going there then you will never find a fitting place. A year is the best summary event-wise we can have, as most events like Christmas sales, summer holidays, Christmas holidays, black Friday and what not are equally shared among each year."
2021-04-26 14:39:24,stocks,"So I think you might be misinterpreting my math or what averages represent. I'm not showing what percentage you will achieve by doing a strategy every single instance. I'm showing you on average  if you plucked a single instance out of all the examples given what you will probably achieve. In the case of a year there is ~253 instances (trading days). Your math only reflects the difference between the first day price and the final day price. 


You're correct that if you divide the final price by the first price you will get a 1% increase, however, you're ignoring all the movement in between and how volatile/calm it could be (which is my whole point). Essentially your're ignoring the other ~252 instances. By averaging that many instances you get a much more accurate representation for if you  plucked 1 instance what the movement would probably be. It's a much more true representation to the movement during that year. I'm not claiming my math is the superior and best way to represent the year but it's certainly much much better than the current YTD figure. Comparing only the first and final price removes any importance of movements between them. You said it yourself: 
> I won't have a 16% return after 1 year if I start investing at any point

So then why is that figure the one that represents the entire year and is being circulated in the media, investment firms and what not?"

The German world-wide wholesale retailer Metro AG: $MTTWF (or $B4B in Germany) is overlooked in my opinion.

$MTTWF was originally founded in 1964 and has grown to operate across 26 countries. It was spun-off from $MTTRY in 2017 and the share price has been falling ever since.

$MTTWF shows stable revenue from wholesale (2017 - 2018 dip was because they stopped reporting the hypermarket department revenue, sold in 2020). The wholesaler is leading the pack in multiple countries, and is growing in other countries.

It‚Äôs been trading side-ways with 5 - 6 P/E lately so I‚Äôve done some comparison between $MTTWF and $WMT. $WMT is financially doing 20x better than $MTTWF (possibly due to business model diversity + dominating the US market). However, the market cap of $WMT is almost 100x that of $MTTWF

Assuming $WMT is trading at fair value today, doesn‚Äôt this entail that $MTTWF is massively undervalued (20% - 30% of fair value)?

Position: I own 572 shares of METRO AG as of today, and got some spare cash incase of a dip

2021-04-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Can Someone Please Explain the Mechanics Behind ETF Rebalancing to Prevent a Discount/Premium?  To keep it simple, I'm wondering about how an ETF with a single asset would rebalance (perhaps this is not the correct term), e.g. a bitcorn ETF. If there is lots of intra-day demand and a premium is created, at the end of the day, do they just buy more bitcorn? Do they maintain cash reserves for this purpose? Or do they sometimes issue more shares? Thank you."
2021-04-26 14:10:31,stocks,So ETFs are fluid and trade throughout the day so there is no premium at the end of the day.  The price of the ETF changes based on the supply demand of the ETF which should theoretically be reflective of the price of the underlying assets (NAV).  If the price strays too far from the NAV there are authorized participants that can create or destroy shares of the ETF by buying or selling shares of the underlying assets in your example bitcorn (which I am assuming is some electronic produce).  So if the ETF is trading higher than the NAV one of the authorized participants can buy the underlying assets and create a new share of the ETF and then sell it to the buyers for a profit instead of selling existing shares (this keeps the price from getting too far above the NAV).  If the price is lower than the NAV they could then sell the underlying asset and destroy shares of the ETF.  This way the outstanding shares of an ETF is not static but the price should stay close to the NAV.

Cornerstone Strategic Value Fund, Inc. (NYSE American: CLM) (the ""Fund"") announced today, contingent upon final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, that it has fixed the close of business on April 16, 2021 as the record date (the ""Record Date"") for determination of stockholders entitled to participate in the Fund's 1-for-3 rights offering. The Fund is issuing to its stockholders non-transferable rights entitling the holders to subscribe for an aggregate of 26,029,753 shares of common stock. Each stockholder will receive one non-transferable right for each share of the Fund held as of the Record Date. Fractional Shares will not be issued upon the exercise of the Rights. Accordingly, the number of Rights to be issued to a Stockholder on the Record Date will be rounded up to the nearest whole number of Rights evenly divisible by three. For every three rights a stockholder receives, he or she will be entitled (but not required) to purchase one new share of the Fund at a subscription price equal to the greater of (i) 107% of net asset value per share as calculated at the close of trading on the expiration date of the offering or (ii) 80% of the market price per share at such time. Fractional shares will not be issued. In addition to the shares offered in the primary subscription, the Fund may offer a 100% over-allotment to oversubscribing stockholders. Stockholders who fully subscribe in the primary offering will have the option to oversubscribe for additional shares, to the extent available.

The subscription period will commence shortly after the Record Date, and will expire at 5:00 p.m., EDT, on Friday, May 14, 2021, (the ""Expiration Date"") unless extended. The actual subscription price per share will be determined on the Expiration Date.

Shares will be issued within the 15-day period immediately following the record date of the Fund's May 2021 monthly distribution to stockholders. Stockholders exercising their rights to purchase shares pursuant to the offering will not be entitled to receive such distribution with respect to the shares issued pursuant to such exercise.

2021-04-26 11:56:26,stocks,"If I understand it correctly it‚Äôs the other way around, for every 1 share you own your are entitled to purchase 3 of the new issued shares at a rate as low as 80% market value, but that price hasn‚Äôt been verified yet. I‚Äôm excited for this!"
2021-04-26 00:00:00,stocks,Anyone considering Cd Projekt Red? Their price has been the lowest it‚Äôs been in years and has been going considerably down after cyberpunk flopped. I‚Äôve been considering it because I figure once the game gets all the updates to make it work the price will go back up as people who refunded or didn‚Äôt buy it. Will buy the finished version. Even then however it seems that they‚Äôre  just in a slump right now and probably will go back up in some time. Despite it being pretty inconsistent right now I think it will pay off long term
2021-04-26 11:51:12,stocks,"I'd consider it if I could sell CCs to protect against downside, but OTGLY doesn't have options. I think there are better opportunities right now. With how well VTI has been doing, it's hard for me to take any risky plays that I'm not really confident in."
2021-04-26 11:53:13,stocks,"Just buy it before they announce Witcher 4.  I heard some grumblings about it already but once they announce it, their price should rocket up."
2021-04-26 12:39:26,stocks,"There is no reason to buy cd projekt that ships one premium game every 5 years when you can buy Embracer, Activision, Take Two, Bandai Namco, etc with a huge portfolio. 
If cd projekt reaches the moon in whatever years, all the other stocks with already be out of the Milky Way."
2021-04-26 13:39:43,stocks,"> I‚Äôve been considering it because I figure once the game gets all the updates to make it work the price will go back up as people who refunded or didn‚Äôt buy it. 

Totally disagree with this sentiment. Cyberpunk updates were too little too late. People moved on already. Nobody does care about Cyberpunk 2077 anymore."
2021-04-26 12:28:51,stocks,"Yeah I am considering, but I am in no rush.

I might miss it, but whatever. I don't think the company is as crazy of a bargain as people make it to be. It was overpriced because of very high expectations and is now getting slaughtered, because cyberpunk could not live up to the hype. 

When it hits 30$ I'll consider starting a position, but now that I said it, it probably won't hit 30 lol."
2021-04-26 14:43:39,stocks,"It will probably continue to sink for the next months as there is no catalyst to push it and the fundamentals are not that good.

My entry point would be when Witcher 4 is announced and my exit point around two weeks before release date as it will be hastily made game which needs at least a year of patches as all big AAA games are. And that will tank the price as it did with CP77."
2021-04-26 14:26:58,stocks,"i'm concerned that they've become too well known and their best days are behind them in terms of being known as a studio that makes amazing games. (basically the same thing that bungie and bioware both went through, and naughty dog might be at the beginning phases of now).

additionally, it's probably going to be a LONG time before cdpr puts out a new game, so there won't really be any catalysts for major growth any time soon.

even when cyberpunk gets fixed and the next-gen versions get released, it's not going to repair the damage that was done to their reputation. it's basically going to be like how ubisoft was viewed as a joke for years following ac:unity.

additionally, there might be various international purchase fees for them where you live, which is going to add to what you're paying (and make it less worthwhile unless you're buying large quantities)"
2021-04-26 16:05:48,stocks,"Copy and pasting my comment from yesterday in another thread:

Im interested in CDPR with how beaten down its gotten, but it still has issues that id like to see arguments against.

Like I fully expect a Witcher game to bring people back and money to flow, and that is coming, but that could be 5 years from now. I doubt cyberpunk is currently bringing in a lot of NEW money after the launch, I know the launch was a financial success but its not a game that I think will continue to sell after all the bad PR. Cyberpunk was supposed to have a standalone multiplayer with microtransactions, but earlier this year the CEO said things have changed and they are wanting to simply add multiplayer experiences to their single player games, basically it looks like they are wanting to move away from an almost mmorpg GTA online type of game to a p2p co-op and possibly instanced mode, game wise both are fine, but I dont see how you can monetize the later very well. Also they are actively trying to fix cyberpunk, which means paying employees to fix a product that isnt bringing in new money, its an awkward situation at best.

I see potential for a buyout at some point, but its still too expensive, and the MSFT bethesda deal was a far better value due to all the IP and history. Also with how big CDPR is in Poland, im not sure if the company would sell to foreign company like MSFT or EA

Basically, I see value in their next witcher or other game, but I dont see where they will be making money till then, and the next game likely is years away."
2021-04-26 19:06:32,stocks,You could always just get an ETF such as ESPO where it's one if their holdings.
2021-04-26 11:46:38,stocks,No. I'm not interested in holding a game developing company for over 5 years.
2021-04-26 11:46:51,stocks,"Yep. In fact I just bought some. I will buy a lot more if it goes to 150 zloty. Long term I think their multiplayer micro transactions will be a cash cow.

In fact I did an entire analysis on them and update recently. See here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/mlel74/an\_update\_on\_cd\_projekt\_red\_at\_197\_zloty/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/mlel74/an_update_on_cd_projekt_red_at_197_zloty/)"
2021-04-26 11:59:20,stocks,Just bought. Its a bargain at these prices

2021-04-26 12:08:41,stocks,I just bought more and averaged down to 11.87
2021-04-26 12:16:37,stocks,What broker can I use to buy this?
2021-04-26 12:53:15,stocks,I think too much damage has been done for them to recover decently. Even if they do go up when they announce Witcher 4 I truly think they've lost enough respect among the gaming community for this to be worth buying. The updates so far on Cyber Punk have been absolutely abysmal and show zero promise. They haven't even figured out how to make the npcs drive around obstacles yet.
2021-04-26 13:01:59,stocks,"I‚Äôm not even sure that it‚Äôs the same company that made TW3 anymore. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt even matter, as the saying goes, buy the rumor sell the news."
2021-04-26 13:48:26,stocks,I was gonna buy them in 2017 but no brokerage supports them where I live.
2021-04-26 14:23:32,stocks,Famous last words but my only interest in them would be based on the fact that I feel like it can only go up from here. The amount of hype for years combined with the level of disaster CP turned out to be I really can't imagine a worst case scenario. On the flip side they are probably going to be even more cautious with development and releases now so the slow just got even slower.
2021-04-26 14:34:01,stocks,I don't think fixing a game that had one of the worst launches of all time will do much to affect the stock price. I think this stock will be a sleeper until their next big project and even then fans will 100% be skeptical due to the entire flop of CP2077. In my opinion other opportunities in gaming have better chances but I know absolutely nothing about how video game companies are valued. I don't understand roblox so I don't expect to understand anything else in this sector either.
2021-04-26 15:03:25,stocks,the witcher is a good game. I spent half the pandemic playing it.
2021-04-26 15:47:17,stocks,"The development team has imploded and is a shadow of its former self. Just look at some write ups from former employees. It's tanking for good reason IMO. This isn't a ""bargain"" like it's the the same company that built Witcher 3"

I wonder if mobile extender reality smartphone game scheduled for summer will bring more profits. Anyway this and next year CD Project will be patching themselves ...
2021-04-26 16:53:59,stocks,Given its sell-off perhaps it seems enticing but I think it will take a miracle to win back people's trust.
2021-04-26 18:14:45,stocks,The argument isn't whether they will rebound or not but how long it will take. CDPR is only big enough for a one game shop and they have quite a bit of time committed to the clean up and additions to Cyberpunk. They missed out on their own hype train and are now needing to do repairs. Similar to No Man's Sky it will probably be months if not a year or more before the good will is earned back.
2021-04-26 14:30:30,stocks,Please don‚Äôt reply if you have something against Cd Projekt Red. They falsely advertised the game being finished way before it was even close I‚Äôm not denying that or trying to agree with anything they did. I‚Äôm just looking for feedback
2021-04-26 11:58:17,stocks,The argument I was making was that right now cd projekt red is so low and very likely to eventually go back up that it‚Äôs a good investment. But vanguard‚Äôs something that is high now likely to go higher. While Cd projekt red has the ability to make much more in a shorter amount of time. Vanguards just much more consistent
2021-04-26 14:29:20,stocks,"> Just buy it before they announce Witcher 4. I heard some grumblings about it already but once they announce it, their price should rocket up.

probably won't be any time soon. can you imagine the backlash if they announce witcher 4 before they fix cyberpunk (and get  the nextgen versions out the door)?

i'd be shocked if witcher 4 got announced before 2022."
2021-04-26 14:34:35,stocks,"Witcher was and still is a trilogy ...

Of course there can be other games in the same universe, but the story of Gerald is over.

I heard they want to release a hasty made game in the Witcher universe late this year."

2021-04-26 12:49:40,stocks,It‚Äôs not the industry it‚Äôs the opportunity
2021-04-26 13:09:55,stocks,Yes. I'm interested in holding a game developing company for over 5 years.
2021-04-26 12:22:53,stocks,"What makes you think that multiplayer micro transactions will be the cash cow? 

They currently have no multiplayer and are focussed on singleplayer rpgs. They even said in their strategy update that they want to focus on what they are good at. 

I don't see a multiplayer for at least 3 years. Heck, at their development pace plus the time it takes for a completely new engine to make it will probably take 5+ years. 

Besides, the multiplayer could potentially flop (see skyrim) or the microtransactions could very well be not well-recieved. Especially, considering their current reputation, microtransactions wouldn't do their public appearence any good.

I really enjoy your analyses and I am an advocate of buying when there is blood in the streets, but CD project has some fundamental problems that need some major restructuring... and time."
2021-04-26 11:49:58,stocks,Yeah the only downside is that it doesn‚Äôt update the most recent information on the price I have is from the 23rd
2021-04-26 12:20:21,stocks,They canceled the multiplayer for CP2077

2021-04-26 13:38:01,stocks,"Even if they go up when announcing The Witcher 4, the price will probably lose all gains the day after that. People lost all faith in CDPR (and rightfully so), gains are not gonna last. So if you cannot buy this as a long term hold, then what?

The fact is the they mislead both customers and **investors** as to the quality of the game. And they've been doing it for years. This prolonged deception is a major red flag, that you should not ignore when investing. Such deception can be indicative of fundamental problems within the company.

Your investment thesis, takes it on faith that the company will rebound. Yes, they made a great game a few years ago. But many once great companies have fallen victim to mismanagement.

If you want to invest in Cd Projekt Red, then base this decision on corrective actions that the companies management is taking. Don't do it based on blind faith that the company will rebound."
2021-04-26 13:03:30,stocks,"> While Cd projekt red has the ability to make much more in a shorter amount of time.

What do you see boosting CDPR in the short(er) term?

I can see a little bump when Cyberpunk goes back in the PlayStation Store and when they announce the next Witcher project (then some pull back from people taking gains because revenue is a long way away).

I still seems priced like it's a studio that has annual releases or continuous revenue from online games to me."
2021-04-26 14:09:10,stocks,">While Cd projekt red has the ability to make much more in a shorter amount of time.

I'm not aware of any huge potential catalysts in the near term. If you know of some, you could be right. If not, I'd stay away."
2021-04-26 18:23:02,stocks,"It still looks like a falling knife so you have to avoid buying early. However your long term thesis is correct, especially given how nicely the game programming industry is developing in Poland and the CEE region as a whole."
2021-04-26 16:29:06,stocks,"They are definitely working on unannounced games/dlc etc. Software development is most efficient in small teams, and then teams gradually scale up once project core is designed/implemented. There must be multiple teams working on multiple aspects of the game, bugs can be fixed at the same time as new content is being developed by different teams."
2021-04-26 16:26:38,stocks,"Geralt is done as the protagonist, but the Witcher universe isnt. People call it Witcher 4 simply because its easier to understand till it has a real title.

Also I have never heard any rumors of a Witcher game in 2021. CDPR is a slow moving company, their lineup was supposed to be Cyberpunk, Cyberpunk standalone multiplayer (now cancelled), then dual development of a Cyberpunk sequel and Witcher 4. I dont even see them finishing patches of Cyberpunk this year, and we will likely get some janky co-op/instanced multiplayer this winter or 2022 as thats what the code leaks and interviews suggest. 

I think 2023 is the absolute earliest they put out a new AAA game. Maybe they pump out paid DLC for cyberpunk by year end, but I cannot see them even trying to launch a full game, one that hasnt even been teased for Witcher in 2021, at best its a mobile game or something."
2021-04-26 14:52:07,stocks,Maybe that‚Äôs the game I heard about then.   Good point on not fixing cyberpunk too!
2021-04-26 14:37:03,stocks,"What opportunity? Because the price did fall by 50%?

It can fall again by 50% if the next game is also a disaster."
2021-04-26 13:13:07,stocks,Well if you put it that way
2021-04-26 12:49:43,stocks,"I personally believe that these are short term problems. I would be completely fine with them releasing multiplayer in 3 years.

The stock price has gone down so much that I think it's really quite worth it now.

I mean, just look at how much reddit hates the stock now. That's a buy signal :D"
2021-04-26 12:47:10,stocks,Postponed. Not cancelled. They won't cancel it regardless of what they say. Mutli-player is too much of a cash cow for that. See GTA online.
2021-04-26 18:16:47,stocks,"They're a small development company. Besides some storyboarding or preliminary storylines, I doubt they're putting too many resources into another game just yet. They had a long timeline of support and DLC for Cyberpunk similar to Witcher 3 and that was before their game launch imploded."
2021-04-26 14:12:35,stocks,"If those were short term problems a strategy update and organizational restructurings weren't necessary. You might be right tho that the market is overeacting right now. 

Everyone should decide for their own what the company is worth. Revenues for gaming companies fluctuate like crazy. That's why it is incredibly hard to come to an agreement on what future cashflows are worth.

I think the company is undervalued now, too. Nevertheless, you need to compare them against other risk-reward opportunities and I am not quite convinced yet that CDPR is really worth it."
2021-04-26 16:15:25,stocks,"I dont know how you could look at 3 years till they can bring in new money and call it a 'short term problem'. Keep in mind they still are very far away from even making Cyberpunk the game they marketed.

And its not like CDPR is an industry giant with piles of cash and tons of IP. They have GoG and two IP's, one far more successful than the other."
2021-04-26 12:54:19,stocks,"  https://www.techradar.com/amp/news/cyberpunk-2077s-multiplayer-game-has-been-cancelled

It‚Äôs cancelled, there‚Äôs also 0 demand for it"
2021-04-26 12:54:43,stocks,I bet the multiplayer was even more broken than the regular game. I wouldn't be surprised if they just cancel it outright. They haven't even made a noticeable update to the main game yet.
2021-04-26 18:23:10,stocks,They are not small
2021-04-26 12:56:29,stocks,"There is definitely demand for it.

That click bait headline is bs. What they actually said was this:

>Previously we hinted that our next triple-A would be a multiplayer Cyberpunk game, but we have decided to reconsider this now. Given our new more systematic and agile approach, instead of primarily focusing on one big online experience or game, we are focusing on bringing online into all of our franchises one day

That means they are going to do multi-player at some point for all their games.

And once they do if they learn from their mistakes then it will be hugely successful.

They might release another AAA game before cyber punk multiplayer which is perfectly fine. I'm holding for years anyway."
2021-04-26 12:58:36,stocks,They will probably have to write a mutli-player engine of sorts that works as a base for all their franchises I am assuming. It will take a couple of years yes.
2021-04-26 18:35:07,stocks,"They're not indie size but they're not top tier either either. CD has about 1,100 compared to 2,500 for Riot, 4,700 for Blizzard, 5000 for Square Enix, 5800 for Take Two. I think it's fair to argue that CD is a one project shop."
2021-04-26 12:59:42,stocks,"Yeah I understand I‚Äôve been following it closely I play all their games. The stand alone CP game he was referencing is cancelled that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm pointing out. 

Games having online doesn‚Äôt always equal a cash cow, they will need a lot of work to make that happen, that‚Äôs what the CEO is pointing out. The game is very different then GTA series. No reason that they can‚Äôt work toward the goal though."
2021-04-26 16:10:50,stocks,"Yes, and if you look at the entire conversation, as well as leaked code, the original idea of a GTA style multiplayer seems dead. Now they are working on a P2P co-op or instanced type multiplayer, which is perfectly fine for gaming, but I dont see how you monetize that nearly as well. Basically they want to shoe-horn the easiest multiplayer experience into their single player games, not focus on some grand experience.

This is a big concern, because if they arent going to be making money from microtransactions, the next big revenue dump is 5+ years away with Witcher 4."
2021-04-26 18:45:36,stocks,"They are definitely not a one project shop. Cyberpunk was announced in 2013, Witcher 3 released in 2015. At the same time GOG platform was actively developed. That‚Äôs 3 projects at the same time"
2021-04-26 18:50:00,stocks,Preproduction for cyberpunk didn't start til 2016 and that was with a small team. Announcing a game doesn't mean much.
2021-04-26 00:00:00,stocks,"How will E-Commerce stocks react to future Earnings Releases (2/3 Quarter)? As you know, E-Commerce have been crashing earnings YOY in 2020. 1Q of 2021 will surely follow the trend, but how would stocks like Etsy, Amazon, Meli and Shopify react if in the 2nd and 3rd Quater of this year the sales growth stops compared to the worst part of the pandemic?

**Week of 4/26/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/26/21 at 4185.03, above the previous close of 4180.05 on Friday 4/23/21.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020‚Äôs COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world‚Äôs largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could ‚Äú...\[take\] another six months‚Ä¶‚Äù for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW‚Äôs Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, ‚Äú...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter‚Ä¶‚Äù So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.  
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang‚Äôs plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple‚Äôs first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company‚Äôs announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it‚Äôs iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft‚Äôs cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube will testify before a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing committee on Tuesday. The executives have been called to testify on the use of algorithms to dictate what consumers watch and read on the popular platforms. The hearing comes amid concerns that manipulative practices have led to massive distribution of misinformation, with repercussions that reverberate throughout society. The practice of purposefully serving consumers misinformation has been dubbed ‚Äúalgorithmic amplification,‚Äù and the results of the hearings could have a significant impact on the social media industry. All three companies will report earnings this week.

OPEC will hold its opening session Wednesday. The conference will take place over the course of the day, and will include remarks from prominent Russian and Saudi chairman. The conference is meant to be informative and expected to feature little remark on policy. However speculation that additional information on a potential NOPEC bill could have an impact on U.S. trading. The conference comes one day before North American oil giants Exxon and Shell report earnings.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30PM Wednesday. Powell‚Äôs recent statements at press conferences have highlighted an economy which although largely recovered, still faces a degree of risk in the face of the pandemic. Powell stated in an April 11th CBS interview, ‚ÄúThe principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again more quickly.‚Äù Powell‚Äôs comments come a day before advanced release of the Q1 U.S. GDP, which Bank of America analysts predict will show a real growth rate of 6.5%.

2021-04-26 11:29:29,stocks,Hard to say. Pyrogenesis Canada is a stock that recently listed on to the Nasdaq and the chart is not pretty. Not saying they all happen like that though.
2021-04-26 11:32:56,stocks,"You typically see a rise in the day of uplisting and even in the few days following it. You have a large number of buyers suddenly able to access the stock.

The move from OTC to Nasdaq is big for stocks.  Not only does it allow retail investors to access the stock when they couldn't before (e.g., in Canada you can't buy OTC stocks in registered accounts) but depending on the stock it also means various ETFs will now have to add it to their holdings.  If the stock can climb past $10, that is often a catalyst for further accumulation because lots of large funds don't even pay attention to stocks below that level.  So when a stock hits $10 it can suddenly start showing up on institutional screens."

But VFC is a huge company with over $30 billion revenue. It is a fashion/retail conglomerate that owns Vans, Timberland, Dickies, Northface, Eastpak, Jansport, and more recently Supreme among many more.

I became aware of this company after recent reports that Adidas is selling Reebok to VFC. If so, this would be a great acquisition slotting very well into VFC‚Äôs portfolio of outdoor/streetwear/workwear brands.

Interested for anyone‚Äôs thoughts."
2021-04-26 11:04:50,stocks,They pay a dividend too. It may not be a huge grower but its a good stock to own.
2021-04-26 11:01:11,stocks,What makes it a hidden gem? Do you think it‚Äôs currently undervalued? VF Corp been around forever and has a super straight forward business model - most people know what they do and how to value their business?
2021-04-26 12:24:10,stocks,"As far as I can tell there's a deal, but no news as to who actually bought Reebok. Are you seeing something else?

While I really like the North Face and Dickies, I'm not seeing where the growth is coming in those brands (certainly not Dickies, but store branded outdoor apparel from Target and Walmart don't help TNF either). Can you explain your reasoning there?

If they do get Reebok I like the idea, given the gross incompetence of Adidas in trying to take over Reebok's US market with all the subtlety of an arsonist in an acetylene planet, ""Hey guys, let's spend $4B for an entry to the U.S. and then pay to replace Reebok with our own apparel, only we'll have worse style and branding! Then we'll start making discount outlet shoes with their brand AND try to compete in Underarmor's market niche simultaneously, it'll be great!""

But I don't really get the benefit of Supreme and I need to understand the growth story you're seeing along with more definitive news on Reebok."
2021-04-26 15:03:57,stocks,"They run their business strictly by bean-counting.

I've never invested in VF solely because it has the reputation within the industry as the place good brands go to die.

I also hate hate hate their suburban mall/outlet Zumies/PacSun/Dicks focused channel strategy. Their d2c  build-out has been woeful.

They should buy the Coach brand from Tapestry. It would fit right into their portfolio."
2021-04-26 11:05:50,stocks,"Yes but their recent transition to understanding the wide range of consumers, delving into sportswear and streetwear brands (Supreme, Reebok) marking a change in their business strategy that focuses on iconic brands and essentially higher profits when you consider the resale price of Supreme white tees alone"
2021-04-26 12:36:21,stocks,"From several sources, the 2 main companies to make the acquisition of Reebok are VF Corp and Anta Sports. VF Corp are more in line with with the brand‚Äôs target market and retaining the individuality of brands - after all Adidas has not proved a successful model of managing Reebok. 

VF Corp has done collabs between Supreme and North Face in the past, to name one, meaning they can elevate Reebok in one collaboration project. Anta Sports are only big in China. VF Corp is big in China too - thanks to Dickies and NorthFace. 

Dickies is making a come back in retail fashion imo. Aside from the practicality it provides in work environments, Dickies - with the quality sourced industrial minimalist style - is becoming ‚Äúcool‚Äù again. 

Cool means you can sell for insane prices because you become culturally relevant and mark a space in time when it was cool, making them commodities too. Take Supreme where white tees with a Supreme logo slapped on the front sell for the north of $3000. 

There‚Äôs good reason to be optimistic of VFC. It provides a good diversity strategy that taps into work/street wear, in a portfolio along with Nike (sportswear), and LVMH (high fashion)."
2021-04-26 11:11:45,stocks,I guess my question is what about their current valuation seems undervalued to you? Or you just like the direction of their business generally (which is totally fair too)
2021-04-26 11:21:38,stocks,"I believe DCF‚Äôs are undervaluing the growth of brands like Dickies, NorthFace, and possibly the Reebok acquisition which isn‚Äôt be factored. My personal qualitative analysis would say Dickies, NorthFace and Reebok are poised for huge growth in the next 5 years. Reebok can emerge out the ashes Adidas put them in - a brand that sponsored NBA throughout the 90s can‚Äôt go that easily into the night. Huge bull on Dickies too. And the general direction the company is going in with their relatively recent CEO. When it ticks all the boxes I can‚Äôt fault it"

I was looking at VIACs value, and was wondering ‚Äúwhat is the market cap?‚Äù

I see their income and net income.... but when I compare it to market cap (for ratios)... is it just VIAC? There is just as much market cap (more actually) in VIACA [voting shares]. 

There is a big difference in valuation if we figure it with both. This would apply to other stocks with different class shares [i assume]

2021-04-26 07:59:15,stocks,"‚ÄúTime in the market is better than timing the market‚Äù

Most people get burned trying to time the market.  If you‚Äôre confident in the stock, just keep buying in as it goes lower to reduce your avg buy in.

Edit - wow thanks for all the upvotes and awards, I don‚Äôt think Iv seen so many notifications on my Reddit before !"
2021-04-26 10:51:39,stocks,"I think the important thing to consider here is the volume you are trading. Also, you need to consider the 'Wash Rule', which I only recently learned about due to that article that hit earlier this year. 

Wash Rule Summary: Any losses you receive on a stock are added to your base price if you buy back into the stock within 30 days. 

Wash Example using 1 share for simplicity: If you have a basis of 100, sell for 90, you have a $10 loss. If you buy back in 29 days later at $80, that $10 loss is added to the $80 cost, meaning your new basis for the share is $90. 

Because this rule, you cannot count that $10 in 'Losses' against your taxes, as it is now part of your new basis for the shares you purchased. 

&#x200B;

Now, if you were to sell 1000 shares at 90, you would have $90k on hand, with a loss of $10k. If you use the $90k to buy 1200 shares ($75/share), you have increased your position by 20%. Your cost basis for the 1200 shares is $83.33 ($100k / 1200 shares). 

&#x200B;

So basically, it CAN be worth it (with large volumes), but may not be once you factor in taxes too. Re-purchasing the shares like this resets your 'Long' position into a 'Short' position, pretty sure anyway. 

If you are doing small volumes, don't waste your time and money unless you somehow anticipate it dropping immensely. As others have said, time in market is better than hoping to time the market."

2021-04-26 08:52:02,stocks,Yes. But youre fucked if it goes up
2021-04-26 08:07:25,stocks,"I mean it is effective, however, you have to look at the factors in which in why it's going down and if it's clear that it will go further down.

If the stock is 100 and ""tanks"" to 90 you have to look into why it had a dramatic drop and figure out what the best play is....for instance...If it dropped because of a bad earnings report and you feel the company will rebound over time then hold on to it....or maybe you find out that its now being shorted to death and possibly you would want to sell and wait until it finds a new bottom and buy back in.

But i cant say yea or nay because there are too many factors involved. 

Just be knowledgable in what you are investing in so you can make a good choice in this matter.

My opinion I may be wrong

Good Luck"

2021-04-26 10:45:53,stocks,"I was in this position with Joann. I just bought more every time it dipped. Eventually I sold it, making about 8% because I managed to get my cost per share down (cost basis? Is that the term). Then, it went even higher. So I COULD have made more, but at least I made some. 


As it happens, I saw it starting to fall again. I put in a limit order to buy at $11, and now I‚Äôm up 18.55% at the moment. I think the best thing to do, in general, is to buy more when you‚Äôre red, and do whatever you want when you‚Äôre green. In my personal opinion, if you‚Äôre making some money, you‚Äôre doing fine. 


I wouldn‚Äôt sell at a loss unless it was sitting in the red for months and months. If it‚Äôs a huge loss, I‚Äôd hold it and try to make money somewhere else."

If you do it once, it probably won‚Äôt be a big deal. It‚Äôs better to sell at a loss imo than lose it all. If you don‚Äôt have faith in the company, then sell imo. But odds are you‚Äôll sell the bottom. That‚Äôs been my experience. Your loss tolerance is the same as anyone else‚Äôs and these big funds know it. They buy as soon as we all sell. 

If you fancy yourself an expert at predicting the market, then you should have no problem buying the bottoms and tops and knowing when to sell. If your questioning whether you should sell for a loss you probably didn‚Äôt buy the bottom to begin with. Maybe you‚Äôre not so great at predicting? I‚Äôm not."

2021-04-26 14:26:13,stocks,"The answer to that question is a simple YES ! 
Now if you were able to know when the price would be dropping you would have never bought at the high price in the first place."
2021-04-26 14:42:20,stocks,Id like to take an ‚Äúadd to your position‚Äù strategy during dips.
2021-04-26 15:16:50,stocks,"In theory, yes.  

For example: 

If you have 10 shares at $100:  $1000

If it goes to $110 and you sell:  $1100, so $100 gain

If it drops to $90 and you sell: $900, so $100 loss

If it drops to $80 and you buy: $800

If it reverses and goes up to $110: $1100 -$800 = $300 (gain) - $100 (loss) = $200 gain

&#x200B;

So, yes, if you sell it for a loss at $90 and then buy it back at $80, and it then runs to $110, you will have twice the gain ($200 instead of $100).  However, how do you know that the price will dip lower and how do you know that it will go back up?  We simply don't know.  I have been tempted to do this many times, but I resist.  Sometimes it would have worked and sometimes the stock didn't recover at all.  Instead, I add to my position in a dip and try to average down if I think that the company is good and will be worth more in the future.  It is really all just gambling in the end because it is just not possible to time the market.  I hope this helps.  Best of luck!"
2021-04-26 15:17:58,stocks,"if you have confidence in a stock, why not double down and buy another share when it dips? You'd lower your avg buy and in the event that your stock surges again, you'll have more money (and shares, which is important) than if you had taken the loss. 

Here's a scenario (figures and values are totally hypothetical but it's for the purpose of supporting the above logic)

Stock A is $10 per share, so you buy 1 share.
Holdings = 1 share, worth $10.

Stock A has a bad week and is down to $5. Seeing that kind of drop can be detrimental and many unsure people would probably bounce out. If you sold now, you lose $5. No big deal, but that's half of your initial.

If you buy the dip, now you have 2 shares with an avg buy of $7.50.
You're still down $2.50 from your initial investment, but that's better than being $5 down. 

In the event that this stock goes back to $10, you now have two shares worth $20, netting you $12.50. 

That's 125% gain from your initial.

2021-04-26 08:56:23,stocks,"I've wondered about this.

Is there an equation to calculate this?

If you sell at a loss, then buy again at after it goes down even more, how much does it have to go down by for you to make more money than you would have done if you'd just held it from the start?"
2021-04-26 09:02:56,stocks,"another question is, will it go down further?"
2021-04-26 09:05:34,stocks,"Depends on the stock and why is it falling. If you believe it will go up then don't wait it goes lower. Just set yourself limits when do you add more. 

What I personally do is, I wait for 20-30% drop if this happens (example m....med) I sell all so I get back the lost tax I have already paid with some profit taking from other stocks (located in Austria). Then I immediately buy back + invest the returned tax + add some of my funds. 

It works wonders. Managed to Rebuy m..med just before the latest bull run. Already up 100% with the add on part of the holdings. 

Just my tactic.

2021-04-26 10:05:46,stocks,"If you assume a priori that the price falling from $100 to $90 means that the price will continue falling to $80, then yes, selling at $90 and rebuying at $80 makes sense.

However, when the price falls to $90, you are not endowed with the knowledge of whether it will continue falling or go back up. Both are possible, and no one knows which will happen. If anyone did know, they would make endless amounts of money.

In practice, what is most likely to happen is that you will sell at $90, locking in a 10% loss, watch it hover between $88 and $92, and then rebuy due to FOMO when it rises back up to $97.

Remember, the only time you should consider selling prematurely is if you believe something has fundamentally changed about the stock since the time you decided to buy in. If not, you just have to accept the waves of the market."
2021-04-26 10:13:02,stocks,Yes. If you‚Äòre 100% certain you can do this. Unfortunately this only works in theory and the market won‚Äòt react in a way you expect it to.

2021-04-26 11:29:02,stocks,"Yes, but it *usually* doesn't work out this well. The only time I consider it is when I have a large amount of short-term gains that I really don't want to pay taxes on all in one year. Selling and then buying back in after 30 days lets me write off that loss to offset the gains. If I get lucky and the price is the same or even lower, great. If not, oh well, at least I get to write off the loss.

I never use this on a position I plan to hold forever (e.g. VTI)."
2021-04-26 11:32:10,stocks,"depends if you are in it for trading or for investing. Depends on what is your financial strategy. If you liked something at 100 enough to buy it, then you should love it at 90 or 80. Buy more and average down your cost. 

IMO it's ok to break your diversification rules a bit here too. You can adjust that when it rebounds if needed.

But you have to be careful not to catch a falling knife either. Be sure to know why its falling and that the business hasn't fundamentally changed."

Either I sold at the bottom and it went up or it was very stressful 'hoping' my stock would go down enough to justify selling low and buying lower. I'll do it with a stock that's gained if I think the price is going to go down after earnings or something, but in my limited experiments it's mostly more stress than it's worth."
2021-04-26 11:38:48,stocks,"No. 

You should only sell if you're changing your investment strategy, I.E. changing from energy industry to tech or moving into a mutual fund or ETF because circumstances caused your risk tolerance to change. 

Otherwise it is a terrible idea to constantly move money around. Just be patient and let it snowball, the most successful people have a strategy, have faith in their strategy, and have the discipline to take hits to their strategy before making minor revisions to it."
2021-04-26 11:41:07,stocks,"If you think it will go down, sure go ahead to reduce your cost basis...but if your long it is less risky to just ride the dip and buy more.

Alternatively you could sell, wait 30 days and buy on 31st to avoid wash sale and Tax Loss Harvest.

Alternatively, you could sell, park it in something unrelated for 31 days, sell that, and rebuy then and still Tax Loss Harvest...your outlook could change in 30 days and you might decide to just leave it in whatever you parked the cash in."

2021-04-26 11:44:07,stocks,"It‚Äôs affective it if works, from my experience selling on the way down then trying to buy again at a lower point doesn‚Äôt always work out as planned. Instead I usually buy a few shares when I first start investing in that stock watch the price for a little then if it goes down to my price point I buy more and wait for it to to hit my selling price point. But when I invest in a stock I look for something down the road a couple months and make my bet on what I think that news will do for the stock.

Buy for longer term and don't play hot potato with stocks. That's gambling. Even if it's a good stock, you might lose a lot if money.

In other words. Taking a loss is a tax issue, not a strategy factor. The only thing you should ask is, how confident are you it will continue to go down, how confident are you it will go back up eventually, and how much are you willing to bet on that belief.

If the answer is not very confident in the short term, but still confident in the stock long term, just keep buying in. If it's no longer confident short term or long term, sell and move on. If it's highly confident both short and long term, do it, but be prepared to buy back in at a higher price to regain the long term position."

Short term - go in with a larger amount on a trade that you expect to increase in the short term. Set a stop loss to minimize your loss. Start a new trade when  you think you can make gains. The goal is to win more trades than you lose.

* wash-sale rules
* fee to sell & to-rebuy ($10 here / there adds up)
* loss of time with regards to capital gains
* tax implication

The last two are the most important to me.  If you flip out and into a stock many times, it's a short-term capital gains loss which is realized.  If you know that the stock is going higher than your initial buy-in point (which is why you bought it in the first place) then you are resetting the clock until such a time it becomes a long-term capital gains.

$100 to $90 looks good on paper, but you've just achieved $10/sh loss + fees.  You've also reset the clock by whatever time period you have in order to gain profit on that $90.  Whether it was 2-days or 363-days, your short-term position has changed the time horizon in which you can reduce your tax bill to 20% of your gains (aka, long term capital gains).

Not worth it IMO."

If I don‚Äôt have any money to average down on the stocks I already have, I just hold it. I suggest never ever selling to buy in at a cheaper price. Because you automatically lose and there‚Äôs no way to get that back. Even when you make profit off of the lower price of the new buy, the profit is for that one not the one you sold. And you‚Äôre basically starting off at the lower price when you buy back in anyways. So, why not just hold what you have, you know?"

2021-04-26 14:19:01,stocks,"with over 400 replies i'm sure many have mentioned this already, but look into what a ""wash sale"" is. there's going to be a 30 day clock after you sell that will be relevant for tax purposes.

as far as what you're doing goes, ignoring the tax implications, it really just boils down to what you think the stock will do in the short and long term. if $90 ends up being the bottom and it simply goes up after you sell, you lost money when you sold, and lose more when you rebuy. in this case, you would have been much better off just holding it.

if you sell at $90 and it DOES in fact continue to dip and you can buy at $80, you'll be making money (assuming that after it hits $80, it DOES go back up).

at the end of the day, you have to ask yourself how much you stand to gain. if you're talking 10 shares, is a potential $100 really worth the risk of the stock simply going up after you sell? probably not. if you have a bigger holding though, maybe the answer becomes yes."

You could sell a call option to someone who would pay a premium to buy the stock at $90, for example. If the stock goes up immediately, you lose. But if it continues to drop and stay down before the option expires, you keep the premium.

There's a lot of ways to play the market if you know how it's going to go. It's all about building a strategy that balances your acceptable risk."

2021-04-26 14:29:48,stocks,No. Taxes
2021-04-26 14:30:50,stocks,"I would not. This is from an investor's (not a trader's) perspective: 

You're right though: your stock will probably trade a lot lower. It will also probably trade a lot higher. So? Sell high and then rebuy lower! Right?

The problem is, it doesn't work like that because you can't know WHEN it will trade much lower, and then when it will trade much higher or vice-versa. Maybe the company is working on a secret squirrel deal that will make the price explode just after the bell today.

Another tidbit: if you sell for a loss (I like taking losses, it's good for taxes) because you see the trend heading lower ( ""the trend is your friend"" is an old saying on the street ), then unavoidably you will buy back in once the trend looks bullish. 

So if the trend keeps going say 20% lower, and then reverses, you have to buy back in within that 20% or you will have been better off keeping your stock. But the trend actually turning bullish may very well only happen once the stock has reversed 25%, 30% from that low. Then you buy in and that's 10% you're not making.

Which is why personally when a stock of mine doesn't look set to do much in the immediate, I sell calls on them, the short one month kind and not at the money so that if I'm wrong and the stock trades even a little higher, it has the room for that.

And it works. It's like an extra dividend."
2021-04-26 14:31:10,stocks,"Well yeah it‚Äôs just a matter of timing it. Sure your down 10 selling at 90, but than you hold the same product at 80, effectively giving you 10 more bucks to put back in or keep. You‚Äôll get more bang for the buck or save a little buck on the same bang. 

But you may sell at 90, 80 never comes, and you buy back in at 100 again. So now your down, potentially can‚Äôt write off, and have even more buck into the bang you just had. 

This is probably why it‚Äôs good to know what you‚Äôre going for when you buy a position, and have a clear outline on your intentions for either way the price goes. Don‚Äôt buy a long 20 year hold to than try timing it on a short term meaningless dip. Don‚Äôt buy back into something if you were just thinking it was to expensive to hold through the dip at this same price."

2021-04-26 14:37:26,stocks,"If you lose 10 (100 - 90) and then buy at 80 to be at zero the stock needs to go to 90 and you sell 10 = (90 - 80)  so you need to sell at 90 and buy at 80 and sell at 91 or more to make a profit.

Now practically looking it all depends on the stock. If it is a falling knife type of stock you are better off not buying after selling but forgetting your losses and moving on.

If it is a good stock and it falls for some reason (e.g. some ETF reshuffled it to follow rules and it has low volume usually) then it makes sense to sell and buy again but here you must be lucky enough to time it. And that can be a loser game against high frequency trading algorithms.

In general the bets strategy is to know why you bought and sell only when you are no longer sure that you should buy more shares. Read the book by Peter Lynch on how to pick stocks."

However, in the investment community, the method you are describing is known as ""trying to catch a falling knife."" 

I'll explain why. 

The trick is that price movement is very difficult to predict. Many would argue it is impossible over the short term. The trouble with the logic is obvious: why buy back at 80 if it might drop to 70? Sooner or later, your crystal ball will fail you, and leave you with either of two outcomes: it bounces earlier than you expect, leaving you empty handed, having sold at the bottom, or you buy back only for it to fall further, and you will wish you hadn't bought in at all."

Or is it a failure in the company. Missed a deadline, changed a goal which will lead to less of a return in the long run. is the stock already valued high or low? 

Lots of things to consider.  I personally prefer to just add to my positions when they dip (as long as I remain long term bullish in the company.)  If I think a company is extremely over valued and I won't make more of a return than I already have then I'm more likely to sell.  (Bought at $40 with a $100 price target, then the stock goes to 110 and then drops back to 110 or 90. Then I'd sell.  On the other hand if I think a stock is worth 100 and I buy at 40.

""Should I sell it for 90 if I could get it for 80 as it goes down?"" Well, if you have a magic crystal ball that tells you the bottom of every stock, you should sell everything you have, and use your magic ball to buy the one that's about to go up the most. Except you don't know what that is unless you're a time traveller.  If your crystal ball works so good, why did you buy the stock at 100 to begin with?

Take the beliefs and put them in one hand, take a piece of cow dung and put it in the other, squeeze them both and see which one comes true first.  Ok best of luck.  


Edit: I should mention something from poker that's true in investing: multiple ways to win. In poker, it's good to bet, because your opponent might fold: you win. But it's also good to have good cards, because you might end up with the better hand: you win. And if you have a made hand, but your hand could get even better as you draw more cards, you have a third way to win. Multiple ways to win.  How does this help? Well in stocks, if you believe in the stock long term, AND you also think it will go up short term, you have two ways to win. If it goes down short term, you can just HODL, and most stocks will go up over time so you're fine, you still make money.  Now let's remove the long term option, which is what you're talking about in your example. You sell, hoping to buy back at a lower price (or effectively short the stock through extra steps). Well, if it doesn't go down like you thought, you don't win, and you have no ways left to win.  So this is why it's best to buy stocks you believe in, that have strong fundamentals, and if you get lucky and they also zoom up in the short term, you have extra ways to win. Good luck."

You will just end up rebuying out of FOMO when it's gone higher that what you sold for, OR you will just watch it ride up and kick yourself for never buying back at all.

So, if you believe in the stock (why else actually thinking about rebuying in) just save yourself the trouble."
2021-04-26 15:42:33,stocks,"If you believe in the company and want to own the stock, average down. If the company is going through hard time or bad press, that‚Äôs a different scenario. You might want to pull the plug"

2021-04-26 15:44:02,stocks,"Fuck no. In this case, consider your unrealized losses as realized. Unless you plan to margin your position at a lower price, you're much safer simply recovering your losses over time by bag holding. If you're confident in the stock enough to rebuy, then you should be confident enough to baghold while it comes back up. Trying to predict the short-term movement of the market will get you burnt 90% of the time."
2021-04-26 15:44:04,stocks,Remember to wait 30 days if you‚Äôre going to sell at a loss and buy back in. If you don‚Äôt wait the 30 days you‚Äôll get hit with a wash sale (used to prevent people from cheating taxes by selling at loss on December 31 and buying again January 1 the next year and writing a loss on taxes) and end up paying extra when you buy back.
2021-04-26 15:45:28,stocks,"If you don't sell you don't take the loss.
Youre better buying as it lowers then sell and hope it goes down as their could be news that could make it go up.
If you sell, you lock in the $10 loss.
If you buy as it drops you can average down which will eventually do the same thing without taking the loss."
2021-04-26 15:46:12,stocks,"Whoa whoa whoa. Are you telling me you can predict how much lower a stock will go? If so, please do tell.

All sarcasm aside -- if you believe in the stock. If you know what you hold. If you believe in what you bought at the price you bought it at, I personally prefer to average down and wait for it to uptick.

How do you know that the stock will go to $80 instead of rocketing to $110?"
2021-04-26 15:46:44,stocks,"Remember that nobody knows how the market will react, if you do this and it works its a lucky move. 

As other say, best bet is to buy the dip and avg down. 

Doesn‚Äôt work if you put everything on the stock and cant avg down. best bet is to wait for the dip to pass.  Happened to me many times.

If you do it and it works just don‚Äôt make a habit out of ir.

2021-04-26 16:00:54,stocks,"Sure in this hypothetical scenario you should. The problem is there is a ton of data that shows time in the market beats timing the market on average. The greatest and most educated of investors are almost never capable of predicting market movements this well on a consistent basis. If you‚Äôre asking this question on Reddit, I‚Äôm going to guess you‚Äôre no Warren Buffett. No offense by that, you‚Äôre just trying to do something that the best of the best try and often fail to do. You‚Äôre better off buying and holding long term."
2021-04-26 16:02:03,stocks,Also you‚Äôll have to deal with wash sales with buying back within 30 days.

2021-04-26 16:19:17,stocks,"Absolutely buy back later lower. Many people are tentative of this because they do not understand Wash Sale Rule, or are afraid that its already at the bottom. But it is never at the bottom. 

Even a limit buy at 89 would be better than keeping it at 90 imo"
2021-04-26 16:21:52,stocks,"I swing trade often so I trail my stops and get stopped out automatically if the stock drops. I may decide to re-enter the stock later sometimes at a lower price, sometimes higher."
2021-04-26 16:23:25,stocks,"Here us a easy solution.  Hold the stock and sell 90 put.  If price goes down, you get the stock for 90 minus the premium credit.  So your real price is 88, if stock stays the same ir moves up, you still have the stock, so you make money and you also got 200 bucks of credit.  If the stick stagnates, you got 200 dollar profit"
2021-04-26 16:25:17,stocks,"Basic answer is yes, it‚Äôs possible and can be worthwhile. 

Long answer is, as others have said, nah."
2021-04-26 16:26:56,stocks,Your cost basis chsnges but your original cost basis never does so even if you buy it at 80 and goes up to 100 and you think you made $20 when reality your back at 0

Long on the Stonk? Buy the Dip. 

When buying the Dip, your goal is to reduce the average cost of the stock to you. 

Buy in at 100, then buy the dip at 50... Your average price could be reduced significantly....
Let‚Äôs say your average price/cost to you shot down to $75 per share. 

GREAT, now when that stock hits $100 again, your up 25% on your investment because you believed in the stock and bought the dip."
2021-04-26 16:37:36,stocks,never sell for a loss kid
2021-04-26 16:38:16,stocks,This strategy has been successful for me in the past.
2021-04-26 16:40:08,stocks,Its a bad idea unless youve been holding the stock more than 30 days.  Just buy dips to avoid a wash sale. If you have to sell at a loss at least you can write it off.
2021-04-26 16:43:11,stocks,No. Wash sale.
2021-04-26 16:45:25,stocks,If you expect it to go back up from eighty then yea

2021-04-26 16:48:23,stocks,"I commonly hear this referred to as ‚Äúharvesting a loss‚Äù or ‚Äútax loss harvesting‚Äù. If it‚Äôs a stock you want to hold long term and there are gains elsewhere in your portfolio you take the loss to off set the cap gains. 

If you are in the US I believe you have to wait 60 days to buy again. Otherwise you can‚Äôt claim the loss.  There is a rule against selling and then rebuying buying the same stock quickly. or one that is substantially the same."
2021-04-26 16:49:21,stocks,"I only read about 60 comments but didnt see anyone mention wash sales, you cant sell a stock at a loss and buy it back in a 30 day window. If you do, they will just re average your buy price as if you had just bought more shares at the lower price anyway, so if you buy at 90, sell at 80 and try to buy at 70 then you will end end up with an average between mid to high 80's anyway.  


Better to just DCA. Some peoples math here really does not check out haha."
2021-04-26 16:49:39,stocks,I mean if you KNOW it's going to go lower then yeah lol
2021-04-26 16:49:55,stocks,You can but should wait 30 days so you can claim the loss before buying again.
2021-04-26 17:03:18,stocks,Isn‚Äôt that a wash sale?
2021-04-26 17:05:42,stocks,"I would not do this.

1. First, if you sold it at a loss and end up buying it back within 30 days at a lower price, this is a **""wash sale""** and the loss you initially had when you sold it gets added into the price when you purchase the shares back. So...it's a ""wash."" Example, if you bought 10 shares at $100 and sold them at $90 (10% loss), then bought 10 shares back a week later at $85, your actual cost basis will be $95 (not $85). This is only if you buy back within 30 days.
2. You do not know how much it will continue to go down, IF it'll keep going down, or where the bottom is. So if you believe in the company long-term, keep buying shares to average down. If you didn't ever believe in it, then all you're doing is rolling the dice when you buy it, rolling the dice when you sell it, and rolling the dice when you buy it back. Unless you're following some technical analysis indicators (which I highly doubt you are)."
2021-04-26 17:06:26,stocks,Look up Wash Sales before you do any such thing
2021-04-26 17:30:31,stocks,How do you know you can buy it lower?  You got a crystal ball?
2021-04-26 17:38:54,stocks,"If you sell at a loss, you‚Äôd have to wait ~30days to buy again otherwise your cost basis gets adjusted up."
2021-04-26 17:40:59,stocks,Wash rule
2021-04-26 17:45:27,stocks,"No, this is why you should should always have 10-20% of free cash in your account so you can buy more at dips or sell offs...if you have faith in the stock and done your homework you should know that time in the market will get you more money than trying to time the market...

Selling low and trying to buy in lower will often just get you burned, you make money through commitment and buying more at the right time (when the stock sells for a discount of some sorts)"
2021-04-26 17:47:53,stocks,"LOL, just keep buying more and then later, buy even more even cheaper."
2021-04-26 17:49:43,stocks,That's a good way to Wash Sale yourself :/
2021-04-26 17:51:38,stocks,You will never predict the market. If you are thinking like this then you are not fully confident in your picks that holding at 100$ will make it worthwhile. This is a fast way to sell your strong convictions that are going down for what ever reason to FOMO into high fliers that you get caught holding the bag. I‚Äôm not even mentioning the wash rule on your taxes if you do this
2021-04-26 17:53:42,stocks,"I somewhat do this and it has worked out for me.  I HOLD the current shares and average down when I can. When it increases back to the first buy price I sell the original shares for little to no profit and keep the lower cost shares. If you are comfortable buying at the lower price, you expect it to go up again. So not a huge risk holding. Usually I just end up keeping the original shares anyway..."
2021-04-26 18:03:31,stocks,Hope you wouldn't do this with 1 share.. Commissions are a bitch!
2021-04-26 18:43:06,stocks,If you sell for a loss and then rebuy doesn't it count as a wash sale and screw up your taxes?
2021-04-26 19:12:01,stocks,Too risky no need to take that risk just buy and wait we got plenty of time left cud be a month more if u want more make some moves and save money each check and wait for a dip to buy

2021-04-26 10:48:34,stocks,That would be a wash sale. A better idea would be just to keep the ones you have already bought and buy more at the lower price averaging down.
2021-04-26 10:54:55,stocks,Learn about wash sale rule.
2021-04-26 09:34:38,stocks,Read about the wash rule
2021-04-26 09:57:46,stocks,If you sell at a loss and buy back in lower within 30 days you have a wash sale and are subject to being taxed differently.
2021-04-26 10:11:44,stocks,That would be considered the wash sale rule.

2021-04-26 11:03:22,stocks,"negative, shit will be a wash sale, you have to wait 30 days before you can buy in again. If not you will have roughly the same cost basis as you did before"
2021-04-26 11:48:27,stocks,That makes no sense whatsoever.
2021-04-26 11:55:35,stocks,"So you failed at timing the market in the first instance, but somehow believe that you're now highly capable of timing the market? 

If it was obvious that it would fall further, then why hasn't it already happened? You think there are professional traders who know it will fall but just sit there waiting to lose money? Or could there be more to it than what you as a sole retail investor with a very limited scope and knowledge are aware of?

Beware of timing the market. It can work after extreme falls. However to believe you can safely time the bottom after you already failed in the first instance is just more likely to drive further losses."
2021-04-26 12:19:04,stocks,I'm very concerned if this confuses you... maybe you should stick to vti

2021-04-26 09:22:15,stocks,"My strategy over the last 5 years is and probably always will be ""The Panic  Hold""

It's a variant on long term investing, just reframed into motivated by a fear that the market will turn around the moment I sell at a loss.

It's mostly worked out pretty well so far. The TSLA rise, split, rise, fall and currently slow rise really tested my nagging ""dont be greedy voice"" in my head."

- base buys at a selected % drop for example
You have 400 available for this stock

2021-04-26 11:16:40,stocks,Agreed every time I have ever tried to time the market it has a quick turn around. If you want a lower position 9 time out of 10 it is better to buy more at a lower position to average down.
2021-04-26 12:01:39,stocks,"Just to be clear buying in as it goes lower doesnt always reduce your avg buy in.  You can still buy in above your previous buy and if you believe in the stock, thats not a bad thing."
2021-04-26 12:06:54,stocks,"This. 

I invested into Ocugen at around $11 a long time ago. It dropped all the way down to $5, up and down many times, and on the way down my friends were telling me to sell, it‚Äôs gonna crash, it‚Äôs not worth it, take the loss.

I kept accumulating and dropped my avg cost by over $3. Ocugen went way up the other day and is still up. I sold for over $300 profit from a relatively small investment.

Time in the market is much better than timing the market. When in doubt, hold."

2021-04-26 13:00:52,stocks,"‚ÄúTime in the market is better than timing the market‚Äù is gold but I feel there's a lot more factors that play into it. For sure, I'd say 90% of the stocks I bought 3 years ago when I started investing have appreciated over time. But at the same time I think it's important to recognize market trends. 

For example, other than a few stocks I wasn't big in investing, but between January to February I invested alot of money as I was sitting on it for 1-2 year (hindsight told me dollar cost average is the way to go, should have spread it out in 2020). I dumped a lot of money in. And of course, February proceeds to plummet and basically all the stocks (including ETFs, hi ARK) are down 30-50% and I'm bagholding. If I could go back, I had the gut feeling with all the news of all time highs and inflation, but I said, ""well heck I can't time the market...""

I should have cut my losses and bought back. But instead I kept buying with drops to dollar average cost down, not knowing it'd continue to drop like 20x again and now I've run out of money to average down. In this scenario, I do believe cutting my loses would have ended me in a better position, eventually my money will grow back but... I'm missing out on 30-100% gains from my losses now."
2021-04-26 15:35:40,stocks,"What if you‚Äôre confident in the stock, so as it creeps up a tiny bit from your initial buy in price, would it be crazy to buy more at the slightly higher price? If you think it‚Äôs gunna keep going up?

2021-04-26 17:13:57,stocks,Dollar costing down is one of those super powers I learned after my initial phase in the market. It really is the way. And it makes you enjoy the dips - although assumes you have cash to play with
2021-04-26 18:01:45,stocks,"This I understand and agree with 100%.
But what about if you invest in a stock that you love longterm, and it shoots up from $10 share to $30/share, and you think it's just being pumped temporarily and love the stock long term, but know it's going to dip down to say $15/share again in the short term. Do you sell at $30/share, take the profits, and reinvest it all when it goes to $15/share? Or do you just keep holding because you are confident it has potential for $50?
How do you work out the calculation"
2021-04-26 18:09:52,stocks,"Only one caveat though, if you've assessed your risk correctly, you already know your stop loss level.

If you're below it, well the decision has already taken you out of the market."
2021-04-26 18:20:09,stocks,"I would say with a caveat, you need to realize when you‚Äôre throwing good money at bad investments. If something keeps dropping, diluting, and having reverse splits it‚Äôs better to take a loss."

But again, not the kind of gamble I wanted to get involved with as I‚Äôm still new to this.

2021-04-26 12:52:56,stocks,"I mean OP is kind of talking about the opposite. Price starts going down, sell in a panic. Buy more at a lower price and hope it swings up. They‚Äôre just FOMOing back in when they should have either sold and moved on(if something fundamentally changed/need to cut losses), averaged down, or held on tight. 

The problem is the wash sale like others have mentioned. There is no reason to sell as it dips and buy back in and lose the writeoff of that first dip. 

I fell into a similar trap when I first started and it was because I did no research and was trying to time the market on the AMC memestock stuff. I sold as it fell and then bought in as I believed it was about to run up again. It did, but not as far up as I had hoped and I lost the tax writeoff."
2021-04-26 14:07:47,stocks,"Not necessarily. Circumstances change, that's the point, otherwise stocks would not move in value, ever. If I bought at $100 thinking ""x"" was going to happen and it drops to $90 because ""y"" happened instead, I may as well want to sell to get in back again at a lower price. It all depends."
2021-04-26 13:42:35,stocks,"This is the best way to look at it.

If you were a buyer at $100 why would you sell for less when you'd also -- supposedly -- be a buyer at that price. I feel the most logical solution is to just simply buy more. Lowers your average and you hold it for the future. I never buy short-flips, though."

You're long-term greedy, not short-term greedy.

I bought HPE near last year' bottom.  So far it's bounced back nicely - but each time I consider selling I think, ""Hey, I'm making 5.5% dividends on this, PLUS it keeps going up! If I sell I lose those dividends AND any additional gains!""  So I hold.

2021-04-26 08:18:47,stocks,"Short-term movement is really, really tricky to time, especially without underlying catalysts. If something goes from 100 to 90, but you feel like it should be higher than 100, you need a pretty good reason to think it‚Äôll hit 80. 

The market is inefficient (until it‚Äôs not), but the future is typically priced in. Unless the outlook for a company gets bleak but you think it‚Äôll recover, I wouldn‚Äôt be confident that something you‚Äôre bullish on will dip to where you wanna rebuy. As others have said, it‚Äôs best to hold if you still believe and add to it instead of swap out. You may be able to do what you‚Äôre saying, but that‚Äôs not a sound strategy across your investing career."
2021-04-26 08:24:52,stocks,"I‚Äôm going to take your question at face value: yes the math checks out. 

Here:
I have 10 AAPL bought at $100. I spent $1000.

AAPL goes down to $90, and I sell. I received $900.

AAPL goes down to $80, and I buy. I spent $800.


My AAPL shares: +10 -10 +10 = 10

My cash: -1000 +900 -800 = -900

So your buying price per share is $90/share vs the $100/share you originally spent."
2021-04-26 10:52:45,stocks,"Of course the MATH is sound. No shit that if you can sell at 90 and rebuy at 80 you win out.

The MATH is never the issue. Trying to time the market, trying to time the psychology, is the issue. And that is the hardest part about it."
2021-04-26 08:23:11,stocks,"I‚Äôm going to argue that the math isn‚Äôt sound because the probability of predicting what will happen in the market is low.

If you sell, you‚Äôre already locking yourself into a loss, and then you won‚Äôt be able to buy back as many shares. However, if you watch your $100 investment tank to $50, and you buy even more shares, then you‚Äôre lowering your average price per share *and* increasing the amount you‚Äôre holding. Now the stock only has to go back up slightly for your investment to turn profitable and you didn‚Äôt lose a dime.

2021-04-26 10:50:50,stocks,There are tax implications to this kind of trading as well called a wash sale which means you can no longer claim those losses from the original sale. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp

2021-04-26 12:09:48,stocks,"What you described could basically be called a ""covered short"". In principle what you want to do is the same as shorting: you sell the stock now, hoping to be able to re-buy it later at a lower price. The only difference is that you'd be selling your own stock instead of borrowing it from someone, hence ""covered""."
2021-04-26 08:00:35,stocks,Ber you it flies up a few percent after you sell. It's nearly impossible to time it that way
2021-04-26 14:47:17,stocks,"You can, but if it's a long term hold you're better off using available funds to average down. If you're in the US selling for a loss to buy back cheaper has potential (IRS wash rule) implications. There are cases where selling for a loss to buy back cheaper and incurring tax penalties can be net positive, but more often it does not.


Brief explanation: If you bought the share and then sell for a loss within 30 days from that purchase date you do not receive a tax deduction for capital loss. Additionally if you purchase then wait over 30 days then sell for a loss you also cannot buy it back for 30 days otherwise it also incurs the Wash Rule. (30 days backward looking for a purchase, and 30 days forward looking from a sale). If you do buy it back in the forward looking 30 days, your purchase carries the capital loss from being a wash; However, if you sell again within 30 days (for a profit or loss) the original loss reverts back to being a wash and cannot be carried out.


Edit: This not financial advice, trading advice or tax advice. Please do your own research with qualified experts."
2021-04-26 17:24:24,stocks,yes because the technically when your stock price drops you've already lost the money. Are you going to be able to sell shares that are worth $80 for $90? No.

Watch it, hold it, and learn from it. There will always be more opportunities to make more money in other securities once you‚Äôve learned enough. Your money will come from a company‚Äôs value gain more than your timing of the movement.

Good luck!"
2021-04-26 10:21:40,stocks,"And regarding this, if I believe in an investment but think I can get a better price, then I buy to average down and later sell higher up positions once it's hit - as in, I set a sell order for the price where it goes equal. 

This might sound stupid at first, why not simply keep the shares if it's going up for a profit and why put more money in while it's going down right now?

Well, this is where difficult decisions come in.

Let's take a look at this example:

I buy shares worth 3% of my portfolio at 100$. It drops down to 90 and I truly believe it will go up because there is a solid reason, so I increase my position to 6% of my portfolio (I chose 6% because it makes the follow up calculation easier, doubling down on an investment is not a thing you should just easily do). This makes 2 things: 

1) I averaged down my Investment by 5% total or 50% of its previous to current price. This means even if I don't reach the 100$ again but only 95$ I could sell all at no profit, no loss.

2) My new goal is to mainly sell off the higher position I have to balance it back to being 3% of my portfolio, since this was my initial goal. I can't even remember how many times a sudden bounce happened, I got greedy and stayed in just to see it go negative again. Using sell orders at a certain price really saves a lot of money. 

Of course if it keeps going down I start having issues with this. I doubled the amount I lose and now averaging down becomes harder since I need more to make it move down. That's why it's important to only do this if you really believe it to jump up soon due to earnings or the companies/stock history. Or a sell off might be happening e.g. like with the wealth tax increase, where it resurged soon after. So if all went accordingly for this particular case you should have a position back at 3% of your portfolio, your money is back but now you don't pay 100$ per share but 90$ per shares. Since you used a fixed % of your portfolio (3%) you own now more shares than before (11% more). If it goes back up to 100$ you already made a profit of 11% compared to the previous case."
2021-04-26 08:29:06,stocks,"Yes, it will work it you have a magic ball. There might be some way to do it with options. Also limit buys/sells. But in those cases you‚Äôre still taking a risk."
2021-04-26 10:12:03,stocks,"In hindsight a lot of things would have been better than the option someone chooses, simply because there are so many that you can choose from and they change every moment.

What if you sell at a loss at 90, it goes down to 87 and jumps back up to 95 and keeps increasing? Not only did you receive a loss of 10 per share, but if you want to buy back in you have to pay more now.

Not making an argument that you shouldn't sell, but rather that there is a counter-example for every other example. If you are short- or mid-term investing, then selling at a loss is a valid strategy to either get in on a lower amount or not getting back in at all - this is important to determine when you think about selling. E.g. if you definitely want to get back in again (e.g. because you expect a big jump soon), then selling is a higher risk of just losing more money. If you only want to get back in at a lower price and only if the price continues to drop, then selling is a good choice."
2021-04-26 10:52:13,stocks,"You're not taking into account capital gains tax here. If you bought at 50, sell at 90 and buy back in at 70 then it goes up, you're gonna have to have enough profit to make the taxes you've just acquired worth it. And if you time it wrong and sell at a loss and buy back in now you have a wash sale."
2021-04-26 10:39:48,stocks,What about the fees and such ?

2021-04-26 11:45:04,stocks,I mean it‚Äôs pretty obvious that it will lower your cost basis... but at the end of the day you are still in red. Chances are you will sell at $90/share and if will jump up to $100 and you become even worse off for selling

Everytime you want to buy or sell, ask yourself if you think it's a good choice.

I've seen people say they won't average up, but that's idiotic, because if you think it will grow more, then buy more.

If you think it goes down more and don't expect it to go up, don't average down and just sell.

Obviously don't panic when there is movement, but forget about all the other stuff, just think if it's a good moment to buy or sell."

They are all up today, and every time they've gotten to this point (since ATHs) they've dropped like rocks. I want to rebalance and move it all into VOO and a few other trusted individuals...question is with TSLA earnings after hours today, should I exit them now or after earnings?

If I completely liquidate right this second, I'd only lose about $600 total. Is it worth it to stop the bleeding now, or wait for a post-earnings pop from Tesla, saving myself a few hundred if I sell after-hours, tomorrow, later this week.

Thanks. Just ready to finally move on to these since I'm not interested in playing these long."

2021-04-26 13:56:58,stocks,"I feel like it‚Äôs a great time to get in.  If the split actually happens, it will be a huge catalyst.  And if it doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs still a great stock with plenty of upside."
2021-04-26 14:10:18,stocks,Good time to get in regardless
2021-04-26 14:13:35,stocks,FOMO into Alphabet too
2021-04-26 14:47:33,stocks,"never fomo, at least for me it's never worked out. I'd rather miss out on gains that do it"
2021-04-26 15:02:36,stocks,You mean like how I FOMO'd into ARK ETFs in the beginning of February?
2021-04-26 07:38:00,stocks,I would like to know if those extra shares are going to be available on the open market or strictly reserved for M&A. They've suggested it's for M&A which means it shouldn't affect the price a lot? Not sure tbh.
2021-04-26 11:46:54,stocks,I heard someone talking how about a stock split. Any truth to that?
2021-04-26 12:36:54,stocks,Always best to put in a little at a time (Dollar cost average) over a period of time.
2021-04-26 13:31:32,stocks,don't try to play the earnings. buy because it's a good long term investment.
2021-04-26 14:15:40,stocks,Stock split rumor
2021-04-26 16:02:41,stocks,Lots of fund managers shifting things by selling this afternoon after things popped off today. Some positions probably got too heavy so they trimmed.
2021-04-26 11:13:56,stocks,AMD was a no-brainer buy in the 70's.
2021-04-26 11:15:02,stocks,"Buy, I genuinely think AMD will hit 100-110 by EOY which is a nice profit."
2021-04-26 10:30:11,stocks,"i wonder if any good news and guidance is already priced in at $86

with chip shortage for the next year, AMD is constrained."
2021-04-26 11:11:08,stocks,Happy with PINS so far
2021-04-26 11:29:03,stocks,Buy PINS
2021-04-26 11:07:17,stocks,"Last Q, PINS jumped about 9% on a strong beat, the Q before that they jumped 30%.  I expect them to post another impressive beat.  Impossible to predict how the stock price reacts. I'm long."
2021-04-26 12:21:42,stocks,"PLTR does not justify a 40B market cap, not yet at least. They haven't got any meaningful contracts, there's better places to put your money imo."
2021-04-26 12:12:12,stocks,"Depends on if they can get more commercial contracts. While their main customer is govt, their revenue is capped. Currently making big losses per share in each earnings. priced like a growth stock but (in my PERSONAL opinion) they haven't shown growth in earning to justify growth pricing. Its not a new 'shaking things up' start up, its a several decades old company.

&#x200B;

There is also a bull case (plenty of dd on this sub and wsb for that). And I did own a few hundred shares that I sold for a small profit. But I'm no longer interested on buying the dip in PLTR, not at 40Bn."
2021-04-26 12:00:12,stocks,Idk but I'm selling as soon as I break even lol I'm tired of holding these bags.
2021-04-26 12:11:25,stocks,Do you feel their growth is over? If it is then sell. If you feel they have room to grow i'd hold. But seems like you got into it as a short term swing trade.
2021-04-26 13:21:57,stocks,"Probably rising due to earnings expectations tomorrow.

Also they announced some subscription price hikes.

Also they announced tighter facebook integration."
2021-04-26 13:21:37,stocks,"No way, that's not how anyone runs a business. They raised prices because it will make them more money than lost on users."
2021-04-26 14:03:29,stocks,But do you like the companies ?
2021-04-26 15:38:41,stocks,Geopolitics man
2021-04-26 15:57:53,stocks,"They went through their correction, hope you loaded up."
2021-04-26 15:26:00,stocks,"Nah it'll be fine, I thought the same thing on Friday."
2021-04-26 15:43:54,stocks,Do these count as consumer staples? If they do the consumer staples sector has been down all day.
2021-04-26 15:47:56,stocks,probably more people are selling than buying
2021-04-26 15:53:42,stocks,"They all had huge runs over the past month, so they were due for a pullback. Also money has been rotating back to growth over the past week. It happens."
2021-04-26 17:14:21,stocks,Why though? A week ago a lot of people on here were bashing that stock
2021-04-26 19:00:19,stocks,"In general it's just easiest to manage one fund instead of having to add in small cap yourself. Also VTI has outperformed by a couple percentage points over the past 5-10 years, and would continue to do so if large-cap growth stagnates"
2021-04-26 19:00:16,stocks,Which is why I own both
2021-04-26 19:48:47,stocks,We had a nice green day friday and it was followed by a nice green day today
2021-04-26 19:42:51,stocks,"I love that we can't trust green days anymore. We were all in love with the market, now I'd say 80% of us hate it"
2021-04-26 19:55:57,stocks,"I know it includes a red day in there but this was the 4th straight day that .IXIC actually led the Nasdaq-100. 

This may not be fake this time given how badly bruised up and beaten some small and mid-cap tech (aka: the favorite stock of the younger investor) has been. There's still some things to look for though, because .IXIC did get about 20 points from the highest its ever traded and ARKK (my favorite indicator for growth stocks) is still down a little over 18.4% from its ATH."
2021-04-26 13:48:55,stocks,goodbye shorts? how so?
2021-04-26 13:56:50,stocks,Where is it being reported that Amazon is going to split?
2021-04-26 10:49:24,stocks,There's a lot of stocks reddit hated last year that have done very very well. Basically all financials for example.
2021-04-26 11:44:31,stocks,"New to this, so historically, does it mean the price will drop?"
2021-04-26 12:17:20,stocks,"If so AMZN could easily hit 5k by EOY. They're genuinly an everything etf disguised as a single stock. Cloud, ecommerce, entertainment, pharmacy, live sports etc etc, they got it all. EPS only grows every earnings."
2021-04-26 11:39:33,stocks,Bloomberg just mentioned this as a possibility.
2021-04-26 11:53:40,stocks,"I'm selling puts at $220. I'm 100% ok buying at that level. I'm tempted to buy now at $230 but since I can't commit, the puts force me to pick a price. Even if it doesn't get assigned, $100/week in premiums is better than nothing."
2021-04-26 12:12:06,stocks,"Unless you've taken a time machine to 2025, no."
2021-04-26 12:53:23,stocks,"I wouldn't exactly label NIO as a stock you ""buy and forget."""
2021-04-26 13:09:26,stocks,Everything is inflating right now
2021-04-26 15:02:51,stocks,I'm about to fomo on this shit
2021-04-26 15:03:19,stocks,I bought at 30 and will laugh so hard if I end up making $$
2021-04-26 15:39:13,stocks,"It looks like a mini-rebalance into growth--defensive sectors are all generally lagging the market (Consumer, Utilities, Healthcare, Industrials) after a run up since January."
2021-04-26 16:08:34,stocks,Didn't even have to use my AK
2021-04-26 16:06:37,stocks,"Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up  
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up  
Today I didn't even have to use my AK  
I gotta say, it was a good day"
2021-04-26 17:19:35,stocks,Still down 50% from recent ATH. That's no achievement...
2021-04-26 17:55:12,stocks,Cathie bought 2 huge chunks of shares in the last few days
2021-04-26 18:12:44,stocks,There was a short sell report that did not hold water; then ARK invested in it.  Earnings are coming out May 4th.
2021-04-26 06:54:44,stocks,"I'm worried of a dump around that fed meeting. But with this momentum, it feels either like most investors don't care or we're getting bull trapped. I'm new so just holding off overall for now, can't really read situations right yet."

2021-04-26 08:12:27,stocks,The only thing I'm buying before earnings announcement this week is Apple. I am real interested to hear Chevron on Friday. Wondering if I should buy more of that and average cost down.
2021-04-26 08:33:25,stocks,"Besides all the known ETFS, I'm slowly upping my position in  $CLF, $BOTZ AND $AACQ and also my pennystock of $HEPA."
2021-04-26 08:50:32,stocks,VST
2021-04-26 08:10:38,stocks,Guess I'll buy any earnings dip if possible.
2021-04-26 10:45:26,stocks,Rumor of partnership with Apple apparently
2021-04-26 11:10:21,stocks,"Bought in Feb, still bag holding at 17% down."
2021-04-26 10:56:34,stocks,">I am waiting for after earnings to buy in. I think it can fall more. It is still below 200 day moving average. I usually use that to get out of falling stocks, so on this one I will wait for it to cross up again before buying."
2021-04-26 13:35:35,stocks,walmart is a buy whenever and hold forever.
2021-04-26 12:15:12,stocks,"Being aware of your own limitations is a good idea in these situations.

Take myself. I know I'm just one monkeybrain retail investor who does this while slacking off at my real job, so me picking 40 stocks is unlikely to beat the market. The amount of time and research to keep up with all those companies is just not worth it. Sticking with a manageable number of high conviction plays will likely give you better results over time."
2021-04-26 12:08:58,stocks,"you'd probably be better off holding a broad market etf

40 is a lot to monitor"
2021-04-26 12:25:04,stocks,buy vti and schd. 50% of ur portfolio
2021-04-26 12:06:50,stocks,How much do you know about those 40 companies?
2021-04-26 12:13:37,stocks,"if you own 40 stocks...why not just own s&p or similar index? The problem with too many stocks is you have to keep up with them, with earnings, balance sheets, share dilutions/buy backs, when to buy/sell etc etc. You most likely won't do that and it will lead you to underperform the market. 

With indexes, other people do your homework for you. They rebalance, they buy new companies doing well, and sell old companies on their way out, and pay dividends from dividend stocks. All without you touching anything."
2021-04-26 13:51:23,stocks,"As someone who started started serious DIY investing in late January and used to hold that many stocks himself, take it from when I say that is not the way. While you don‚Äôt need to just make 80% of your portfolio VTI and call it a day, at the same time it‚Äôs really hard to make diversified portfolio full of many stocks that won‚Äôt just underperform the market anyway. And when correction happens and things drop left and right, you‚Äôll be hard pressed thinking of what you should double down on and what needs to be cut off. 

While you don‚Äôt want all your eggs in one basket, it also pays not to have too many at once. You stretch your gains thin, make it more likely to pick up losers, and balancing will be a nightmare. I‚Äôve since dumped like half those positions off and consolidated into the ones I like more and a few ETFs and I overall feel WAY more confident in my holdings. 

A portfolio you‚Äôre not confident is doomed to fail."
2021-04-26 12:05:03,stocks,Uh yeah
2021-04-26 12:29:45,stocks,No. Also it's going down right now
2021-04-26 12:53:04,stocks,I'd probably wait for earnings at this point. But it's a solid long term hold either way it goes.
2021-04-26 14:32:55,stocks,"Really hope this means we had a double bottom and now the IXIC can shoot past 14,000 going fwd. Zooming out on the chart, the top area looks almost like a smaller version of what happened after the 2020 crash and recovery."
2021-04-26 14:10:28,stocks,"Sold all my NVDA beginning of this year and put that money into ARK.K and ARK.G. Wont lie, its been the worst move I've made so far this year. Down around 8% combined.

However, personally I have no intention of selling. I do believe that ARKs days of absolutely insane growth are probably behind it, but I'm still expecting a steady return in the comming years. They have a 5 year time horizon and I plan on being patient. 

VOO has been amazingly consistent for me so if you do decide to go that route you should be great either way"
2021-04-26 13:56:50,stocks,"Dude, I'm absolutely not an expert and really have no right to give advice, but I know what I would do there. A lot of people make the mistake of holding onto losing stocks way too long, after the point they're past hope. However, with a reasonably strong ETF (like ARKs are, IMHO), I don't see any reason not to hold onto until it goes up unless you need the money now (which it sounds like you don't).

Basically, I think it's going to take a lot longer to recover your losses using an S&P tracking fund than from ARK_. I'm not sure what percentage of your portfolio these make up, but since you say ""only 600,"" I'm guessing it's not a huge share.

Edit:
(BTW, I don't have an answer about the TSLA earnings...I don't follow that stock closely, so not sure how it tends to behave, so I can't really help on if your sold selling now-ish.

ALSO, I just now read your final sentence about not being interested in playing these long. I completely get that...and actually have some ARKK shares I'm deciding what to do with, though they're all positive. I just think it's possible you're going to be paying a significant price for the privilege of not having to look at them in your portfolio each day, which will effectively cancel out the (likely) comparatively small short-term gains from elsewhere in your portfolio.)"

2021-04-26 14:41:01,stocks,"One thing to consider is it will now be easier to do Covered Calls/CSPs on, but yes with fractional shares stock splits are no longer as big of a deal."
2021-04-26 14:58:48,stocks,"yes, it's all psychological.  Some people will see the lower price and just buy it, not understanding it's the same equity in the company 0.5 shares before compared to 1 share after.  So more demand for the few that don't understand this and price goes up."
2021-04-26 14:30:06,stocks,"stock splitting allows people who can't buy the stock but want to, to be able to buy the stock"
2021-04-26 14:27:27,stocks,"Fractional shares are not available everywhere. I live in Canada, not possible here."
2021-04-26 14:55:21,stocks,I use Merrill. They do not offer fractional shares
2021-04-26 19:08:40,stocks,"Can‚Äôt trade fractional options, so lower share price makes options more affordable"
2021-04-26 14:16:14,stocks,"It‚Äôs because more shares are added to the overall share pool. 

Say a company is valued at $100 and has 10 shares. Then each share is worth $10. If they do a stock split, what is happening is they add in 10 more shares. Company value is still $100, but now there‚Äôs 20 total shares so each share is now worth $5. 

There are different types of splits too but the basics is that fractional shares are dividing already existing shares, splits are adding more to the total number that exist"
2021-04-26 15:17:00,stocks,I can't find specific news. Growth stocks in general are doing very well today.
2021-04-26 17:15:43,stocks,I find it funny that a week ago a lot of people on here were bashing that stock pretty bad lol
2021-04-26 16:59:23,stocks,"Hmm.  That's interesting.  When's earnings call?

All paint has had great sales due to the pandemic and the current home sales/renovation/construction boom has to be helping them as well.

Not sure if what you're describing will really hurt their bottom line but you have a reasonable thought there."
2021-04-26 16:58:38,stocks,I dunno but I took a 7k position on them a month or two ago and I'm up about 15% as of close today. I'm very bullish. As you well know they have an awesome product and people are never gonna stop needing it. I've always exclusively used SW and probably always will. I've painted a ton over the years being a homeowner and owning multiple real estate investments. I've always thought their paint is superior to all the others I've tried.

2021-04-26 17:01:46,stocks,AH is usually meaningless due to low volume (at least I hope) -- and I bet most are waiting to see what gets said on the earnings call. Interested to see how things will look after the call and during market hours.

Holding calls through earnings is a gamble that could go either way. Last earnings AAPL gave its best earnings ever, and stock went down.

2021-04-26 15:57:36,stocks,"This. I think your portfolio is right where it should be now, just let those indexes start compounding."
2021-04-26 16:38:39,stocks,"This exactly. It's also increasingly difficult to ""beat the market"" the longer you project into the future. If you're long-term investing, it'll make more sense to just DCA into those broad market index funds of yours and let it work for itself. Plus, I believe the market is overall pretty expensive right now. I wouldn't do more than DCA'ing with the exception of your individual picks."
2021-04-26 18:16:46,stocks,"So lets say I started the year with $1000. Then on December 1st it's $1200, and I sell all my positions and hold only cash and don't touch any investments until like February next year.

So regardless of everything that happened in between the year to Dec 1st, you will end up owing like <tax rate>% of $200 for the year?

Or can you end up in a case where if you followed this strategy, you can still end up owing more than $200?"

Anyone who talks logically or rationally that has any type of basis in reality gets downvoted or ostracized. The award counts are bizarre too.

2021-04-26 12:20:41,stocks,In theory if you hold one AMZN stock at 3000. And then it splits 5:1. Then does your stock hold stay at 3000? Because new investors can buy that same stock at lets say 600 bucks(5 times cheaper). So how does the 3k stock value? Sorry if I am not able to explain my question properly
2021-04-26 15:00:18,stocks,"If the stock splits, it suddenly becomes very accessible. TSLA ran from $1400 to $2650 when 5:1 split was announced. Yes, I believe amazon could go on an insane run if split is announced. I also think it would benefit most from bringing its price close to AAPL's with a 30:1 split. But thats just an unlikely dream at this point."
2021-04-26 17:28:46,stocks,Bought in at 17.42 for a long term hold. Goal is to take profits every 20% until I recoup my initial investment and then just let the rest ride.
2021-04-26 12:39:26,stocks,"to me, i'd look at your total portfolio value. I would put 80% of my money in an etf like VTI for example. The other 20% you could use for your individual speculative stock picks."
2021-04-26 13:14:51,stocks,VTI and SCHD are actually some of the best ETFs you buy and hold though lol
2021-04-26 12:26:06,stocks,"Yes. Good tickers would be VTI, VUG are good ones.

Index funds track the broad market or specific sectors. Much safer and usually more successful that way. 90% of wall street pros cant beat the market over a 10 year time period, retail investors have a much lower success rate. 90% of my investments are in index funds, 10% in the more speculative plays that might hit home runs, might be a ground ball out."
2021-04-26 15:02:53,stocks,">picking the best one's you can beat the SPY

The issue there is identifying the good ones. Even stocks that you might think unstoppable (Cisco in the early 2000's) can become outdated and replaced. Myspace and Yahoo faded, google and fb replaced them. Its easy to say in hindsight that the smart thing to do it pick the right stocks, but its a lot safer to pick an index with both of them so you benefit from growth of the economy no matter which company causes it."
2021-04-26 14:35:55,stocks,how many exchanges allow fractional shares? The two I'm on don't have it. Not on Robinhood so maybe they allow it?
2021-04-26 14:44:35,stocks,Oh shit. I stand corrected.
2021-04-26 15:10:56,stocks,"From a math perspective it shouldn't. But it might bring more retail investors in, which would help the price. And someone else pointed out that doing covered calls would be easier to reach. So that could have an effect as well?"
2021-04-26 13:47:20,stocks,"well they say to sell calls, so maybe do that in the mean time.

it seems enough people are betting it will go up, but don't know when. so you can take advantage of that."

2021-04-26 16:38:46,stocks,that my point. Expectation was a 6% move in either direction. Being relatively stable is the next best thing to a spike in stock price.
2021-04-26 12:53:29,stocks,"Yah I have a bunch of shares from around 39, which is a bummer obviously, but also doubled down at like 33-34.  It's been a real bummer of a couple weeks but it looks like it's really heating up.

The key for me is there is still massive institutional holdings and insider holdings.  Pressure is lifting across small caps and SPACs and I genuinely think it'll get back to 40 and maybe crack 50 by EOY.  I'll sell at 50 personally."

2021-04-26 16:04:09,stocks,Not coordinated - more likely just a few key institutions doing some heavy trimming all at once. They did it again at about 2:50 in some areas too if you look at volume. It's not uncommon on super green days everywhere in the market to see trimming to add to COH and lower holdings that became too heavy.
2021-04-26 15:47:09,stocks,Institutions moving money

Basically because that's my plan for the year (I have gains from my company stock... which I think taxes are already paid, and then gains from GME, and now some losses from NIO, but I'm still up bigly over this year, and only short term gains). 

Mostly concerned if there's ever a case where I will end up owing more in taxes than my current portfolio, but from what I understand, if you just follow the strategy of selling everything before the end of year and just holding cash only and avoid buying anything for a while, then you should be good."

2021-04-26 15:01:14,stocks,I think what's happening is the shorts are slowly exiting their positions so that whenever there is a squeeze it won't be as big as these people hope for. I'm probably wrong because I admit I don't know exactly how this works but I do know how to manage my own risks.
2021-04-26 14:59:09,stocks,No. Im not calling it a conspiracy. Im telling you that this isn't normal behavior based on experience that I have in my personal life. I just got my BA in philosophy of mind and I have taken many psychology courses. Read the language that is used by the mods and these internet celeberties. It's seductive and inviting.

I had a look through their dillibits.com ratings (shows online presence / hiring / and nice MISC ratings) and it looks undervalued.

I‚Äôm a newer investor and the stock just went public in January so it feels like it could be over/undervalued since there isn‚Äôt history. I personally am thinking it‚Äôs a decent mid to long term stock.

Anyone else for or against it?"
2021-04-26 08:14:07,stocks,"You guys are thinking too much about international travel and not enough about regulation. Basically, you‚Äôre thinking about things too much in the short term than the long term. Regulation is one of the issues that has been sidelined during the pandemic but as life returns to normal it will be at the centre of a lot of legislation. 

I can picture a lot of European cities for instance moving forward with more regulation on Airbnb rentals (or other providers). Berlin had a ban on AirBnB few years ago, that has since been overturned but now Berlin has some of the stricter regulations applied to AirBnB. Other cities to watch include places like Porto, Prague, Amsterdam and Barcelona in my opinion."

2021-04-26 07:22:58,stocks,"As someone who have a rental business I can tell you that Airbnb is a much better platform for the industry than Booking.com 

Booking is 90% of the market and takes a huge chunk of every booking from landlords. Fuck em and their 2000 dollar valuation. We need competition and Airbnb is made out to be the bad guy through lobbying from...booking.com

Then there‚Äôs the whole name recognition. People talk about airbnb-ing a place, they don‚Äôt talk about booking.com a place.

Then there‚Äôs the scalability that only they and companies like Uber enjoy. They can grow and retract with little cost implications. With ai customer support this will only improve over the years.

2021-04-26 16:56:25,stocks,"I bought at 178, holding for long term. Betting more on the concept than the company.

My wife and I have been using Airbnb off and on for vacation travel for a maybe three years. Noticed some changes as it evolves...

* We've been able to stay in some really cool places with ""character"" you don't get from a motel.
* fees (""cleaning"") have gone up on the individual units. More than you'd think just due to pandemic.
* I'm seeing more smaller hotels showing up in the app, maybe fees are better than BKNG/EXPE, or rentals are more successful due to lower competition. It's an interesting development, though.
* regulations will be a headwind, no doubt.
* We have stayed in a number of places where we actually met the owner and in some cases their ability to collect rental income from their property would be near zero if not for Airbnb (or Vrbo). These companies bring a different type of property into the short term rental market.
* I think their successful niche is the space between a night or two in a motel and renting something for a month or more. 
* They're not going to put BKNG/EXPE out of business.
* They've got a business model that started in an underserved market and has the potential to do much more. Depending on how they evolve, things could get very interesting. Cars, boats, heavy equipment, any asset that is owned by someone not necessarily in the rental business that wants to partially monetize it by getting people to pay rent to borrow it...

I'm into ABNB as a long term thing. It's overvalued right now, but so was TSLA when I bought it at $28. If I had kept it all I wouldn't need to be investing now..."
2021-04-26 05:32:28,stocks,Were about to have the roaring 20s where people couldn't have a holiday or vacation for a whole year. Airbnb is massively undervalued.
2021-04-26 08:14:02,stocks,"I am sensing a lot of negativity toward Airbnb. I believe the fact is it is a major player in the travel industry which is set to explode. I do believe based on recent survey results we wont see the travel boom until 2022/23. I think if you are long Airbnb. Now is a great time to buy. Buy the fear, sell the greed. Patience pays off and all the other stupid things Buffet says. 

Disclosure: I bought Airbnb near the bottom and plan to hold for a minimum of 10 years. Wish me luck."
2021-04-26 12:34:41,stocks,"I might be a little late to the discussion, but I'll give some of my reasons for being optimistic.

I'm an extremely heavy traveller, for a mix of work, study, family, and pleasure reasons, and I started using Airbnb about 15 years ago. If you are only thinking of it as a place to stay during your holidays then I can see why you would believe it's overvalued. However that's not taking into account the range of possibilities. 

When discovering new cities alone or looking to party you choose to stay in a shared house with students or young people. The profiles make it clear who wants to meet people to party with or to make friendships.

Company in general. Don't underestimate loneliness and the need for human contact.

When you need to stay somewhere that's not a well connected town or city. Somebody, everywhere, has a spare room or sofa, and this is where I think the biggest growth will happen. Particularly for people who live in the same area. 

The sheer range of places. I've stayed in luxury apartments in European cities, I've slept in a restaurant in Poland, in a trailer in the States and in the favela. 

How often you'll find that all hotels are fully booked, especially during big events, many locals will take advantage to make a bit of extra money and these numbers will increase.

The ""extras"" that hosts can add which hotels can't. For example extra cooking or experiences, chauffeur

The feeling of staying at ""home"" when you're having to constantly travel. 

Also similar to the last point but not the same, hotels feel identical wherever you are in the world. The same with short term apartments. They often have an identikit feel, and why the fuck is wifi still limited or an added extra??? I'm paying ¬£200 for this room and you really want to charge me extra to watch YouTube and have a coffee?

The cost. When I was in my early twenties even hostels were too expensive. It was amazing to have the option to stay on an air mattress in someone's living room for 5 euros. 

I'm pretty sure there's more I haven't thought of, but I think that's enough for now. I use most methods of staying in places away from home, but for sure Airbnb is the one I'll use most."

2021-04-26 08:23:11,stocks,Dogshit because hotels for sure have lowered their prices due to pandemic and hotels actually have a standard or regulations unlike airbnb. Airbnb is like uber that they have a use but will never be huge and kill off hotels
2021-04-26 06:00:25,stocks,"They aren‚Äôt first to market. You already have Expedia that competes in the same exact business with VRBO. Marriott has a very similar business Marriott Homes & Villas (select areas) and there are others that compete for the same customers think Hilton, Hyatt, MGM, Disney, etc. 

I agree that travel is going to boom and Airbnb is going to be a huge benefactor, however, I think that Airbnb‚Äôs valuation is a bit high when comparing to peers in the industry. I don‚Äôt believe that growth will be as high as the stock price suggests relative to industry peers. If you are willing to wait I do believe that it will eventually grow into its valuation (as will several other names in this space).

Past performance has no bearing on future performance so it would not provide any indication whether it is over/under valued. So the time that it has been trading is irrelevant. 

(Disclosure: I hold a positions in Expedia and Disney)."
2021-04-26 05:45:06,stocks,Some places are reporting short term rental rates are going through the roof due to demand and stays are already booked out through July. Should be an excellent year for ABNB.
2021-04-26 10:31:12,stocks,"I like the stock and have written enough about it in the past. 

Currently one of my top 5 holdings and adding to it monthly.  

I use BKNG and EXPE as comps

Difference is that ABNB is almost a pure play residential leasing platform, after stripping out the small Hotels Tonight business. EXPE is more balanced, while BKNG is highly tilted toward commercial lodging.

I‚Äôm very bullish on the residential housing market over the next five years and my thesis is that ABNB will be an indirect winner as a result.

On the same side of the token, I think EXPE is also undervalued compared to BKNG, especially if they can continue their VRBO rebranding efforts and drive direct traffic (as opposed to Google meta-traffic) at a pace equivalent to ABNB to increase word of mouth and top of mind. Vrbo is their Golden Goose, and they know it.... but they're competing with a 450 pound gorilla who is a household name and whose name has already become a verb (read: direct traffic rather than Google traffic)"

However, I think I shouldn't have bought at peak just because I like the company as I lost liquidity in the short run."

Edit:  As an Airbnb host and most my family running airbnb i'll say that I think the company is  good and is popular with millennials which is what matters as the boomers die off.  I think the CEO I am not high up on for the following:

* His handling during the pandemic was terrible. Airbnb knew their business would suffer months in advance they lost 90% of bookings in China first months of 2020 yet they were still caught flat footed when it arrived state side.
   * They borrowed 1 billion at like 9% interest rate which will be a drag on profits next few years.  
* They been slow at cutting dead weight programs Airbnb experiences was unpopular and cost them 100 million.
* They have a spotty record in regards to defending their business model, in major cities like San Diego, SF and NYC they have aggressively defended their business model.  However in some states they have passed legislation basically limiting cities ability to Airbnb, which I think is better strategy. 
* They need to control their admin costs now that they are public.  Investors care much more about losses than VC funds."

My issue with Airbnb though is, unless I'm traveling with a large group, for the last few years and progressively getting worse, it's basically never worth it.

By the time you add all the fees, it's often way more than a pretty nice hotel and often not as nice or reliable."

Cash money moves in and buys up all available properties, does some minimal interior work to make them look trendy, then lists them on sites like airbnb.

This forces the locals who want to buy houses out of town which requires longer commutes and makes the town less desirable for lower waged jobs (which are needed to support the tourist industry).

I don't know what the best solution is, but it seems like something is going to change at some point."
2021-04-26 11:02:51,stocks,"Regulation has been a headwind to Airbnb for years now, but they continue to sail through it.  I've stayed at Airbnb apartments in a number of countries over the years  (pre-covid, admittedly), and have seen the hosts adapt to their local regulations without too much fuss.  For example, in South Korea they were banned from Office-Tels, so the hosts started renting from large residential buildings that had Abnb ""sections""  or smaller ones that were 100% Abnb.   In Osaka Japan, there are entire apartment buildings  dedicated completely to airbnb, and operate pretty much as hotels without the fuss of housekeeping, linen service, etc.  Each apartment has a digital pad affixed to the wall so if you're arriving from outside the country, you select through the menu, and it takes your picture holding up your passport for legal check-in (since it's not a hotel and you can't present it to a desk clerk).  In other words, Airbnb is evolving from people renting personal properties (though that's always going to be a part of it), to a new business model with investors that are competing with traditional hotels (and without the expense of hotel staff, linen service, etc etc).    I know there are many others like me that don't want hotel amenities , just a small home to call your own while visiting.   I expect that Abnb will continue to grow, as there is demand for it as an alternative to hotels and all their overhead, and I expect that like any other business, adaptions will be made for local regulations."
2021-04-26 09:23:40,stocks,"I agree that regulation is gonna be a severe headwind. And once regulation comes into play, airbnb loses much of its price advantage. Their business is not that different of Trivago or Expedia or even Hotels.com."

He states that ""Vrbo"" is just about ""the only part of the business that's growing"" which basically indicates that almost all of EXPE's 25B valuation is......theoretically based on VRBO.

2021-04-26 10:35:56,stocks,"Anecdotally, the city of Ottawa just passed regulations on this and told Airbnb to pound sand when they objected. The core of the legislation is that you aren't allowed to get a permit for short-term rental unless the property is your primary residence, if it's a property inside city limits. Essentially kills the entire ""super host"" business model inside city limits. Enforcement starts just under a year from now. Source: [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/short-term-rental-regulations-committee-ottawa-1.5994594](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/short-term-rental-regulations-committee-ottawa-1.5994594)

As a homeowner who isn't currently speculating or interested in operating an Airbnb, I see this as a net positive for the housing market in Ottawa. It's also highly positive for anyone who is trying to rent in town, which has become ridiculously difficult in the past couple years, and rent prices have been trending upwards even faster than home prices have.

&#x200B;

If more cities sign up for regulations like this, Airbnb is fucked. Short-term rentals have their place, but combined with rampant speculation and investment in urban property it has proven to be fairly unhealthy for housing markets, IMO. Not sure what the exact answer is, and I think the full lockdown on short-term rentals that aren't a primary residence in Ottawa is probably a bit much... but something had to be done about it, and this is what the council went with."

Also for short term stays it never makes sense because the cleaning fees are often insane.  

If you're traveling with a group that would otherwise need 3 hotel rooms, and staying somewhere for a week.. Sure, it's a good option to just get a house.

2021-04-26 08:00:02,stocks,"There was a real shine on airbnb for a while, much akin to uber, that anybody who stood up to them was gonna get crushed. All comers were getting just fucking hammered by their lawyers because they spent billions on a research/activity praxis geared towards fighting off regulations.

They needed to however, as like uber, their entire business model is ""exploit a lack of municipal enforcement to skirt and undermine regulations."" Nobody wants to live beside a rooming house, that's why they were heavily regulated back in the 19th century. Uber just skirts their laws and regulations through a slick app, but not the basic underlying regulations and supply-control on liveries which, coincidentally, were also heavily regulated in the 19th century. Also, again, for good reason.

But they needed that facade because they couldn't keep burning vc cash on lawyers forever - if one city won then it's game over for unlimited profits and they have to negotiate with every single fucking one individually. A regulatory nightmare for management. 

Inevitably the cities started to win and Covid emergency restriction powers gave regulatory powers extra weight that pushed them all over the edge. Here in Toronto airbnb is despised by the population, homeowners included. Our houses are worth enough thanks, we don't need a 0.2% abnb valuation bump. If the elected politicians wouldn't do something then civil society, which in Toronto is 99% SFH homeowners, were gonna find someone who would. Now abnb is heavily regulated and will be moving forward. 

All that being said I like the company long. I think the hotel and travel world is big enough and they have a foothold in millennials who are just starting to take vacations. They are having trouble attracting hosts which is a good issue to have for a growth company. That's also a little more a moat than one might think. Global growth potential can't really be evaluated yet, but it's a lot. Lastly, if the company goes sideways a bit they'll inevitably merge or be purchased.

Some earlier work correlates viral load and disase transmission (also part of the reason masks and not being inside and exposed for extended periods matters):

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30985-3/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30985-3/fulltext)

combining these suggests that vaccination lowers viral load and in turn lowers transmissivity, though it's still possible that human dynamics are different than the primate models. A lot of human work is ongoing (plus challenge trials in humans are of debatable ethics).

However some reports are now coming out providing evidence of this in humans.

You're totally right that the Phase 3 trials were all about disease outcomes and not about infectivity. And the authors/companies/CDC were very careful to craft policy recs based just on what was found in the trial. (A cautious scientific approach that was refreshing after the early pandemic debacles). Why they didn't design these trials to also test viral loads or asymptomatic infections (and transmissibility by proxy) by randomly swabbing participants is unknown to me... maybe because testing was still at a premium?"

In this case, those listings come from the original companies (British Airways and Iberia). In other cases, you have listings in varioua markets due to ADRs (e.g. NOK is an ADR in NY, but you can also buy the original share in Helsinki).

At the end of the day, any differences should be minimum, due to liquidity and nothing more."

2021-04-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Reviewing the Bear Case on Paysafe (PSFE) JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently noted that fintechs pose ""enormous competitive threats"" to banks and SF Federal Reserve board member, Jackie Reses, sees them ‚Äútaking over and revolutionizing banking‚Äù with ‚Äúa wholesale transition‚Äù of ‚Äúa $16 trillion market cap‚Äù.

In this context, fintech Paysafe (PSFE) is newly listed on the NYSE and introduced to the US market. Already well known in Europe, Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects $100 billion in transactional volume, $1.5 billion in revenue, healthy double-digit growth and expanding $30%+ EBITDA margins, but, despite absolutely no negative news, the stock has taken a pounding which, in turn, has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd address all of these arguments in one post:

&#x200B;

Common bear arguments:

\#1 Old business

\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no moat

\#3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult

\#4 No growth

\#5 Slow growth

\#6 Not profitable

\#7 Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.

\#8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell

\#9 Founder share and warrant dilution.

&#x200B;

\#1) Old business. 

Paysafe‚Äôs extensive experience in risk management and its time-tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths. This is the reason that Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X. ‚ÄúAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.‚Äù

Much of Paysafe‚Äôs business is in back-end payment processing so most don‚Äôt even know they are using it, but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner ‚ÄúBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution‚Äù, ‚ÄúPayment Processor of the Year,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Payment Method‚Äù and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase, Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)

In Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, Trustpilot (1) rates Paysafe as ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as ‚Äúgreat‚Äù (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews.

Paysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They‚Äôve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, Neteller and Skrill, recently voted ‚ÄúBest Digital Wallet‚Äù for ‚Äúbest consumer take up‚Äù, ‚Äúmost innovative technology‚Äù with ‚Äúgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.‚Äù

Aside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service.¬†

In preparation for their plans, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone, two from CVC, the CEO of Dun & Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity.

As Chairman Bill Foley says, ""It‚Äôs going to be a land grab‚Ä¶I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels. 

&#x200B;

\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no moat. 

Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe‚Äôs Chairman of the Board, calls Paysafe,‚Äúa fortress. It‚Äôs got a moat‚Ä¶ We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise."" Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service. There are 1.7 billion ""unbanked"" because so many in the world who have mobile devices, still don't have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts. Paysafe's risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go. Leaning into this strength, they've brought on PayPal's former CRO and added a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors

From SEC filed transcript (2) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh: ‚ÄúTo be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it‚Äôs hard to copy.‚Ä¶We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It‚Äôs a real strength of ours. We‚Äôve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we‚Äôve upgraded the team, we‚Äôve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be a winner in this space, you‚Äôre catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That‚Äôs something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we‚Äôve entered.‚Äù

&#x200B;

\#3) Growth by acquisition is hard. 

Synergistic inorganic growth through M&A is a key pillar of Paysafe‚Äôs forward growth strategy. Bill Foley's proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). Foley says, ‚ÄúThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.‚Äù (2, 4)

&#x200B;

\#4) No growth. 

It‚Äôs true that Paysafe‚Äôs revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid, but prior to that they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5), which is on par with high profile competitors:

2017: $864 million rev

2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)

2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).

2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)

Unlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, ‚Äúexited low value referral channels‚Äù and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.

Looking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:

‚ÄîVisa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)

‚Äî Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)

Not claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below.

&#x200B;

\#5) Slow growth. 

Going forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10-13% annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years. iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe‚Äôs revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion.

Analyst Michael Del Grosso, who recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, ‚Äúwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.‚Äù

In the short time since he wrote that, here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade:

1 ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""

2 ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature""

3 New Hampshire: ""Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign""

4 ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting""

5 ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting""

6 ‚ÄùDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March""

7 ""Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%""

8 ‚ÄúCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL""

&#x200B;

Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (not far from Paysafe‚Äôs minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:

&#x200B;

Paysafe‚Äôs share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&#x200B;

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&#x200B;

Notes:

1 Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.

2 Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.

3 As noted Paysafe‚Äôs 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.

4 The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon‚Äôs ""enormous competitive threats"" comment.

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers projects roughly 20% more growth than Paysafe yet trades at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate.

&#x200B;

\#6) Not profitable. 

Paysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with healthy 30-32% EBITDA margin. As one recent article pointed out, ‚ÄúPaysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability. The company‚Äôs projected gross margin is 63%, an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30%.‚Äù
These fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe:

Repay: -0.67,

Affirm : -2.18,

Nuvei : -1.08,

Paysign : -0.19.

Bill : -0.62,

Shift4 : -0.43

Average EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69
If you read their transcripts and presentations, you‚Äôll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity. They‚Äôve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code. Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M&A activities. From what I can tell, Foley is all about the long game.

&#x200B;

\#7) Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.   
Paysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again? As Fidelity‚Äôs Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley says: ‚ÄúOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe‚Äôs leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.‚Äù

Their 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers. Investopedia: ‚ÄúDebt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.‚Äù 

Of the 11 fintech competitors I looked at, all but three (PYPL, ADYEY, NUVCF), have worse Debt/EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA, making debt service that much more difficult:

Square: 77.8X

Repay : 8.7X

Fiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5X

GPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X

Shift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA

Affirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA

Paysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA

Bill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA

Depending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of the above competitors (by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue) puts Paysafe‚Äôs share price in the $45 to $90 range. Point being, their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag. Further, management has said they‚Äôll be able to fund M&A plans with expanding 32-35%+ EBITDA margins ($500 - 560 million, 21% CAGR) and $362 million in free cash flow.

&#x200B;

\#8) Blackstone made 3X and will sell. 

The common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving $9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public. The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (8), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it‚Äôs more like a 33% return on a 4 year hold.

Importantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley‚Äôs time-tested M&A playbook.

Blackstone itself says (9), ‚ÄúThe term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.‚Äù With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?

Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: ‚ÄúWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.‚Äù

In a recent interview Foley said, private equity‚Äôs plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: ‚ÄúThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn‚Äôt take all their money off the table‚Ä¶All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.‚Äù

This trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC‚Äôs Board of Directors‚Äô Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: ‚ÄúCommitment of Paysafe‚Äôs Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders‚Äô belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.‚Äù

The PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long-term investment strategies, they are closely aligned with Foley and understand both his M&A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the ‚ÄúThe Foley Network‚Äù (perhaps, for example, Paysafe will handle Fidelity‚Äôs massive transactional volume). 
In a recent Bloomberg interview, Bill Foley said, ‚ÄúThe thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table. The companies that I‚Äôm affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it‚Äôs a great asset.‚Äù

Besides, just as large funds will often drive price down to accumulate large positions, they also can drive price up to sell into strength and will do so via off-market trades to avoid price slippage. Therefore, we probably wouldn‚Äôt even notice profit taking until after quarterly filings. Paysafe‚Äôs fundamental value in context indicates such prospects present very little long term risk, especially from current price levels. Given Paysafe's $100B market share (similar to Square‚Äôs), once audited numbers are available, many large funds focused on this space will necessarily seek a more balanced exposure through Paysafe.

&#x200B;

\#9) Founder share and warrant dilution. 

According to the 20F recently filed, roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7.5% (movement we've seen in a day), but the cashless conversion option, generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share, can reduce that dilution by 2/3 to around 2.5%. It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional $11.50 for each warrant conversion. It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios (\~5%) but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things.

Importantly, the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there.

Total FTAC Founder shares 175,292,458 24.2 %¬†

Blackstone Investors 123,734,571 17.1 %¬†

CVC Investors 156,006,433 21.6 %¬†

Other Pre-Business Combination Paysafe Shareholders 53,701,074 7.4 %¬†

Cannae (excluding amounts included in Founder) 50,000,000 6.9 %¬†

PIPE Investors (excluding Cannae) 165,000,000 22.8 %¬†

723,734,536 100.0 %¬†

Below are some examples of the warrant cashless conversion rates per the chart in the S1 (7). Cash redemption is more profitable when commons trade above $18.¬†

$18 : $6.50

$17 : $6.08¬†

$16 : $5.57

$15 : $5.05

$14 : $4.54

$13 : $4.04¬†

&#x200B;

Despite a lack of negative news, short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements (25% to 100% upon ticker change without any prior notice), to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays (7+ trading days) in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms, to things in the media that this sub will not allow to be discussed.  In this context, it is hard not to see a month's worth of ‚Äúfake sell walls‚Äù and HFS ‚Äúshort ladder attacks‚Äù as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but, speculation can only get you so far. 

I think Paysafe is currently undervalued and, as the developments in legalized sports betting come to fruition, it is very likely a 3X from here. M&A plans already in the works will bring additional catalysts. Given Paysafe's healthy fundamentals, large market share in a fintech space known for ‚Äústicky‚Äù customers, and exposure to high growth verticals like iGaming, it seems inevitable that large funds will seek to benefit from these low prices, especially once the first audited quarterly numbers are available on May 11th.

&#x200B;

Note: Per their analyst presentation, here is Paysafe‚Äôs minimum Q1 guidance to meet or beat:

$360 million revenue

$220 million gross profit

$105 million EBITDA

 Happy To see OP put 650k in PSFE. Good luck"
2021-04-26 13:08:30,stocks,"PSFE appears to just be another victim of the shorts hammering every SPAC regardless of the underlying business which scared out the paperhands.

There should be a huge spike in prices for the best of the SPACs as shorts start to take profits or unwind as the economy starts to really boom."
2021-04-26 09:35:09,stocks,"Nice work.  I'm long too.  I think the weakness lately is solely due to the overall weakness in SPACs, but this will get a lot of attention after they post their first earnings and people realize this is one of the rare SPACs with amazing financials."

2021-04-26 09:00:46,stocks,Very thorough. I threw a couple hundred shares into my speculative side a month or two back. Thanks this helps me add to my dd as well.
2021-04-26 10:40:37,stocks,This has to be one of the most succinctly written security analysis on Reddit with actual footnotes. Thank you for this; this just inspired me to do a deep dive into Paysafe.

2021-04-26 05:04:47,stocks,"Biggest bearcase is the lack of growth imo. Over half of their revenue comes from integrated processing. Processing of e-commerce is a growing area, yet they haven‚Äôt grown by that much (taking the industry average into consideration). I don‚Äôt have the numbers at hand, but from 2019 to 2023 (going by Paysafe their own expectations) they manage to have a CAGR of 9%, which is decent but not great. 

Biggest bullcase for PSFE is digital wallets imo, but as more and more states open up for online sportsbetting etc, I also expect more payment providers to become active in that area, which means more competition for them aswell. 

Also, like you pointed out: you have the PI firms aswell. Obviously they‚Äôre gonna be bullish about Paysafe in public. There is 0 reason for them to be bearish about it and tank their own investment. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre gonna sell all of their holdings, but I do think it‚Äôs likely that they will sell a portion of it, which will cause some downward pressure on the stock for the short time. 

All in all, I think it‚Äôs a decent stock to hold, but with the current growth projection, I don‚Äôt really see a X3, at least not in the short to medium term."

2021-04-26 15:20:28,stocks,PSFE is my second biggest holding. When people bring up the bear case my response is simply but are people going to be using cash again as a norm? Are people going to banks or western Union to transfer funds? But most importantly are people going to stop handling money digitally? If anyone can answer those questions I‚Äôll give you the win.

Not necessarily a good thing, considering many spacs don't have deals yet or don't/won't have deals that are that good."
2021-04-26 05:22:07,stocks,"Thanks for your reply. Not 9% btw, more like 10.6% at a minimum. As noted above, pre-covid they reported 27% CAGR so I believe they are being deliberately conservative about their 10-13% projections, especially since they omitted iGaming from that outlook. Time will tell.  Even if they're sandbagging, their projection is on par with industry average from what I can tell and within range of 12.5% growth of the basket of 11 fintechs I used to find a $46 comp (after taking out the top multiples in each category). The balance of growth combined with superior cash flow and Foley's X-factor is what leads me to believe a 3X is in the making. Not short term though. It may take a year or so."

2021-04-26 15:05:53,stocks,"If the SPAC doesn't get a deal then you get your $10 back so there is that. There are still a lot of private companies that are really good that could go the SPAC route. Stripe comes to mind. Plaid, maybe now that V got kicked to the curb.

PSFE should work out well but I like fintech and main stream financial companies so I may be a bit biased."
2021-04-26 05:44:41,stocks,"Their revenue in 2018 was 1227 million, projected revenue in 2023 is 1881, which comes down to 9% annual growth. I think it‚Äôs a bit misleading how in their investor presentation they leave 2020 out of the equation, but so be it. 

I can‚Äôt find all the statistics since I‚Äôm on my phone right now, but from what I can find, Paysafe already had a revenue of 613 mil in 2015, so 125% growth in the period 2015 - 2021.  (And they already had 1 bil in 2016, so less than 40% if you‚Äôd go by that timeframe). In the same time period Square managed to grow their revenue by over 600%. Obviously they‚Äôll get a different kind of valuation.

The growth is decent, but nothing that is really that exciting. I don‚Äôt see why their growth potential would all of a sudden change by that much."
2021-04-26 15:19:45,stocks,"> If the SPAC doesn't get a deal then you get your $10 back so there is that. 

Well, that's if you get in at 10 bucks. If some spacs go big, then lots of people will run on any spac they see and we'll see the repeat of the ones from earlier this year/last year. I'm in some other spacs, maybe if I free up some earnings i'll get into paysafe, at this price it isn't too bad."
2021-04-26 05:57:14,stocks,"The better revenue picture comes from comparing their investor presentation and the more recent analyst presentation. That's how I came to the numbers I posted. I'm not sure how relevant the earlier years you quote are because that was under completely different management. 

I'm certainly not trying to claim that their growth is exciting.  The post discusses many metrics. On the growth front, even at \~10%, it is hard to justify Paysafe trading at less than a third the value of a basket of 11 competitors growing at an average of 12.5%, particularly when half the competitors do not have as healthy profit margins.  

Sure, you can cherry pick growth examples like Square, but it is far more meaningful to compare with larger sample of sector peers."
2021-04-26 06:21:14,stocks,"I mean, to a certain degree using your metrics is also cherrypicking, since there can be made some refinements. Like I said, I think it‚Äôs a decent stock, but if you‚Äôd go by p/s ratio for example, Paysafe isn‚Äôt really underperforming compared to the competitors they have. They are a bit below average, but that could be explained with the below average growth they‚Äôve shown in the past years.

Maybe an unpopular opinion, but the market at the moment cares less about profit and more about showing good growth, especially for companies like PSFE that are active in industries that show high growth."
2021-04-26 06:32:50,stocks,"These appeared to be the most relevant metrics for this sector. Sure, there can always be refinements but I left a lot of room for error.  Keep in mind, I used three different metrics from 11 different competitors with only slightly better growth on average and somewhat worse financials on average and the results put Paysafe's share price at $97.  I am simply suggesting that Paysafe's share price is farily valued at at least  a third of that."
2021-04-26 09:46:19,stocks,And yet it's not $97 so maybe you should be more open to this person's arguments against it
2021-04-26 12:27:10,stocks,"lol, it has only been trading in the market for a few weeks. Give it time. Not expecting $97 for a couple of years."
2021-04-26 13:03:53,stocks,"Lol because one person has an opinion, OP should change his? 
 
Op cites sources, multiple from various websites, lays out reasons for and says it will be a long term hold. 

I'm pretty sure the entire above is a little null, as he may have good points, but I don't even know if I can trust some who says 1000+ million instead of a billion so. I'll take OP's word on this over some random commenters whom don't cite sources."
2021-04-26 15:50:46,stocks,"OP says his stock is worth $97. It's not anywhere near that right now, so clearly OP is probably missing something or overspeculating. Otherwise good luck.

I'm long PSFE but I don't expect it to go to $97 for multiple years."
2021-04-26 16:08:10,stocks,"I said it‚Äôs worth at least a third of that, so more like a $32 in that context. Comps show $46 after taking out high multiples that put it at $97. But sure, put words in my mouth if that works for you."

I really don‚Äôt understand how a stock upgrade in price by JPM and recommended as a ‚ÄúBUY‚Äù by most analysts can be so heavily shorted ! Does anybody care to explain the logic behind hedge funds shorting a stick like this ?

2021-04-26 01:36:43,stocks,"Its only down 5% from its ATH so its not heavily shorted, its current short float is 16% which isn't really high, I would consider anything under 20% as pretty low. Its had a massive rally with $32 seeming to be the resistance area so I wouldn't be surprised if after it grew so much there was some large short interest."
2021-04-26 03:00:34,stocks,"I did not look into the ASO stock. This is more of a general comment.

You have to keep in mind that the Institutions (ie: Hedge Funds) trade against retail traders. A lot of analyst recommendations are just marketing. So you have a stock that looks good to the retailers. That means they want to buy and are willing to buy expensive. So the institutions sell. Which triggers the loss in confidence, analysts changing their mind, retailers selling off their stocks and the price goes down. At which point the institutions buy back the borrowed and sold off shares and voila... they sit pretty.

The thing in the market is that you always have to have someone to trade with / against. If you are buying somebody has to sell and vice versa. And institutions usually hold loads of shares. So what do you do when you want people to act a certain way? Marketing."
2021-04-26 02:23:46,stocks,"If I were to guess it would be the momentum. The stock has seen some major growth, especially in the last month (about 24%), but their low P/E ratios suggest that the company may not sustain its stock price.

2021-04-26 00:00:00,stocks,"How do you increase or decrease position in a stock? Question to seasoned investors.

If you buy a stock that you think is a good investment, how much do you initially put?

Do you average down if it goes down? When do you do that? How much more do you put?

Will you add more if it goes up?

In general how do you increase/decrease your position in a single stock. I am assuming most investors exit with a stop loss or when they are happy with whatever profit they already locked.

I put $1000 in ChargePoint $CHPT. It went up 20% in 3 days. I am struggling to not sell and also tempted to increase position."
2021-04-25 23:30:10,stocks,"Love this question as that's essentially all that investing is about. To me the price movement each day should not have an effect on your decision to add/subtract to your position unless the movement itself is a symptom of a newly revealed issues with the company.

Presumably once you have decided that a company is undervalued, you want to build a position that you are comfortable with and stop. Some people think that technical analysis can be helpful to find an entry point (I don't subscribe to tech analysis, but to each his own). I myself will build a position immediately if I truly think that a company is undervalued at market price. This is because if the company is truly undervalued, it's statically likely that every passing day gives it a chance to ""revert to the means."" And this seems true btw, for every undervalued stocks I bought, it took about 2-3 quarters or less for the stock to show outsized gains compared to the index. Remember that your time dedicated to do DD about a company is also valuable. Why waste that value on the hope that the stock would fall even further?

So, if the price drops, you want to find out why. Does anything change with the company that affects your DD. If so, maybe the new lower price is justified. If the price goes up, does it have to do with good news that were not part of your original DD. If so, maybe the new higher price is justified. If it's purely market fluctuation or news that is immaterial to company's bottom line (see Intel's ""scandal"" about using weak password), I will ignore."
2021-04-26 06:25:38,stocks,"You should reassess stocks frequently, if you wouldn't buy at the current price due to it being overvalued then you probably shouldn't be holding either unless your expecting a catalyst in the near future."
2021-04-25 23:20:32,stocks,If I believe in the stock I continue to buy it no matter what it has done in the past.
2021-04-26 04:17:45,stocks,"To be honest,  I am worried about a lot of the answers were. The real question is - what is your strategy? Do you believe in the company for the next 10 years? Then don't sell, but maybe look for potential to add. But again, add based on your strategy. Do you have an initial target weight in your portfolio? You can split it to into two or three and invest over certain period of time, for example half a year. Do you only ""invest"" for short term profit? Then 20 % are great. Do you believe that the company is great and will outperform for next 5-10 years? Then 20% is nothing. Is the stock of the company very volatile? Some companies go up and down by a lot, and you need to be ready for that when buying. 

TLDR: Have a strategy. Why are you buying the company? What are the three key reasons. What are the three key risks that need to materialize for you to lose faith in the company? What is your investment horizon? Write this down and have a look every once in a while. If the thesis still holds, why would you sell?  Adding to that depends on your overall portfolio strategy."
2021-04-25 23:33:07,stocks,"I typically open small positions at first, never making my entire investment in a single day, but instead over the course of a month or more. For instance, if I want $5k in apple, that‚Äôs accomplished by buying a few shares a few times a week until I‚Äôve reached the size of position I want. Remember, commissions are free now (with some exceptions - I‚Äôm sorry if you need to pay them!)

After that, as I add money to my account, I‚Äôll usually sprinkle that money around my existing positions. If something new catches my eye, typically I‚Äôll ease off a few positions to do so. Again, relying on free commissions.

As for when to add more. If it‚Äôs a position I have conviction in, I want more if it goes down. Recent case in point, I had opened a small position in Intel half year ago right before earnings. They disappointed, the stock dropped and I made more purchases the following day. 

If the stock goes up, as long as I understand why, I‚Äôm happy to buy more. Remember, if you were just buying index funds regularly, you‚Äôre basically averaging up in your positions, not selling, say, Apple or Microsoft because they suddenly got more expensive. A whole lot of money has been made just by buying and never selling. 

Once I own something it‚Äôs not my watch list so I‚Äôm watching for news from it constantly. I know whatever I read will have been priced in by the time I see it, and definitely want to read up on their quarterlies as they‚Äôre released. 

One thing I don‚Äôt do is use stop losses. I don‚Äôt want orders being executed automatically, ever. A stop loss doesn‚Äôt save you from a sudden movement - if you have a $60 stock that opens at $42 the following morning, your $55 stop loss isn‚Äôt going to protect you. 

About my biggest issue is resisting the urge to sell when the price goes up. So unless I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on, I remind myself the whole thing about lots of money being made buying and not selling. 

Things I don‚Äôt understand include apples jump in price after announcing their last split. After it peaked paste $500 I sold. Once it fell back below (split adjusted) I bought back in. GameStop- that was my one meme stock play, rode it up selling along the way to make sure I didn‚Äôt lose money. Made a bit there. And Upwork - despite buying in the teens and twenties, I did force myself to take some off the table. Currently I‚Äôm in the same situation with my largest holding - TIptree, but since I understand what‚Äôs going on, I‚Äôve been buying more rather than panic selling to ‚Äúlock in‚Äù profits. 

It‚Äôs all ultimately trial and error. As you can see, I have my rules but I also break them all the time!"
2021-04-26 04:51:27,stocks,"I believe that looking at it from the perspective of your initial investment is a mistake.  As a basic principle, regardless  of how much you have invested in a position you should be considering it‚Äôs current price (what the market currently dictates it is worth) and where you think it will go from there.  With the CHPT example, whether you sell, hold or add should be based on whether or not you think it is a good value at its current price, or if you think there are other investments that will provide a better return.  This is true whether you are up 20%, 200% or down 50%.

The other thing you need to consider is the tax implications of selling and short vs long term gains but that is a bigger conversation."
2021-04-26 00:27:53,stocks,Open small and pyramid down. Worst case you have small position with a big gain and worst case you mitigate risk on the way down. Then based on position size trim on the way up at resistance levels.
2021-04-25 23:19:06,stocks,"Personally I start with around 25% I mostly like to average down but that‚Äôs not always the case, so either average up slowly (depending on the reason of the increase) or just hold on to my existing position to see what happens."
2021-04-25 23:36:43,stocks,"You need to understand the company, its potential earnings, and decide whether you believe in the stock long term, or if you are following momentum.

CHPT is a company in an expanding market, with the questions being: how expansive? How quickly? 

I read that 80% of EV purchasers will charge their vehicle at home. right now, charging a battery takes 30 minutes at a charging station. There are not a lot of people who like the idea of charging a battery for 30 minutes. Maybe one day in the future (5y?) an 80% charge can be obtained in 10-15min, and maybe the battery range of a car approaches 500mi full charge. If and when such milestones become 1-2 years out, I would find such a company appealing.  The company is not yet profitable. The company's earnings per share do have an appealing trajectory, though its revenue is not dramatically increasing. It will be interesting to see what happens. For example if the Biden administration did pass a bill which provided a great deal of funding for companies like CHPT to set up power charging stations, well, that would be very interesting. On the one hand I don't really think of gas stations as cash cows, but their ridiculous markups for ""convenience"" probably have to bring in a decent profit. 

I would be very interested to see a maintenance costs/sales/profit/competition projection for the company before I would or would not invest. If you have not done these things, I highly recommend you do them."

Stop losses are a way; personally if I‚Äôm feeling the need to close early, I‚Äôll recoup my IV and let the gains ride until I‚Äôm sure I want out.

Go back down to your principal if you need the money."
2021-04-26 03:59:41,stocks,"Something which may help you, you want to try and map out which stocks you expect to make profits from and how much profit.

So for example with chargepoint, did you buy into it expecting it to be up 100% over 3-5 years, if so maybe 20% is good so far, maybe sell a bit when it peaks on a day and average down. Assuming you're not getting rinsed by fees for only using 1000$. IE sell at 25$ and try and buy back in at 23-24.

But if for example, its a 20$ stock and you're expecting it to go to 30$, and it reaches the 25$ mark, I would consider selling a portion and try average down into the stock. Don't sell it all, but after a jump you can expect the price to steadily decrease. It's in these small dips you can buy back into your positions.  So the price target is 30$ in 2 years. it just reached 25$ off of a catalyst maybe 6 months in. Sell at 25$, it will probably decrease to 24-23$ at some point and average in. 

A lot of investing is taking these small profits off of the top, making sure you make that extra 5-10% here or there on a play. But lets say you held 100k in chargepoint, i wouldn't sell it all at 25$, i would consider selling a portion off to lock in some profits then average down."

If I believe in the company I typically average down when the losses seem a bit too high for me, maybe 20-30% losses and I start to average down. It's different per company tbh, and of course how much capital I have available. 

I have only ever taken a profit on GME, everything else is long term, or I'm down so I won't sell just yet. 

I'm also in CHPT, I'm down 28% and have averaged down a few times, now my average price is at 33$ which I think is achievable, so I plan on holding until then.

For example, if you decided you want about 5% of your portfolio in a certain company, bought it up to this amount, and it drops 10% without anything about your vision for the company changing, you should buy back up to 5% of your portfolio as the upside potential has just increased while your (relative) position has decreased. You might even decide that the company now warrants a 6% stake of your total portfolio.

Likewise, if the stock suddenly runs up 100% and you're not comfortable having 10% of your portfolio in this stock, you can trim your position back to 5% or even less if you think it's less interesting of a risk/reward at the new value."

No, that's ridiculous. If this were true you would just put your entire portfolio into the one stock you think will perform the best, but I'm guessing you don't.

If the prices of the stocks shift and your opinion about their future performance is unchanged then you definitely *should* rebalance. Say you put 50% of your portfolio into stock A and 50% into stock B. Stock A doubles and Stock B halves in price, you're now sitting with 80% invested in Stock A and 20% in Stock B. Obviously, this isn't in line with your initial strategy so why should you keep these positions? What you should do if your thoughts about the companies haven't changed is sell of some of stock A and buy stock B until you're back at the 50/50 that you intended."

I disagree. I'd argue the more undervalued you think the company is, you can overweight the stock more in your portfolio. If I think a stock looks promising, but am uncertain about the valuation, I might weight it at <1%. But if it gets cheaper and cheaper and my thesis is unchanged, I might expand to 2%, 3%, 4%, etc. On the contrary, if you think it might start to be getting overvalued, start reducing weight slowly

I did that with LUMN last year/this year. Resulted in buying at $10, but then buying a ton more when it dropped below $9. Then ended up selling most of it at $15 only to buy back in at $12. Then sold at $14 AGAIN and bought back in at $12. Now it's back at $13.

You don't chase the trend. There is an end to each trend which means the closer towards the end of it you are, the riskier the investment becomes.

2021-04-26 08:49:51,stocks,"The valuation differs for growths stocks and value stocks, and of course meme stocks. With growth stocks you do your research on the company, their finances and assets and activities, and you keep an eye out for fiscal reports, but rather don't get too excited about day-to-day news and gossip. *Here* you invest in a company based on the valuation. You invest in accurately valued stocks, stocks that you personally believe in, and once you do - you invest any time, any place, and then just keep on adding unless your trust in them goes away. And in this case valuation is about revenue, or rather, analysts' predictions on revenue, which is usually nicely summarised by the P/E ratio. 

With value stocks it's more tricky. The company would, by definition, be undervalued. Of course primarily you do the same thing as with growth stocks, which is learn everything you can about the company. Actually, triple the amount of research, because you can't be so sure here, even if everyone else is. And then you also have to get the timing right, both with your entrance and exit. Once you're comfortable with your choice, you want to invest as soon as possible. Then you make sure all the daily news about the company, not only financial, but yes also gossipy, go straight to you. Actually, let's pay more attention to the gossip, because then you can actually react to whatever might happen instead of just watching your stock go up and down post-factum. And here you can play a little while riding the wave, do a little swing trading, learn to get a little swayed by the wind. Again, exit when you're not comfortable with the stock any more. 

And finally the meme stocks. Here you don't need to do any research. Research might prevent you from making money. Once you find a crowd madly glorifying a stock you have to channel in to whatever they're doing, and then keep up not with the company itself, but with the amount of glorification they're distributing, and - this is important - exit much, much sooner than they do."

For example if Apple is drops by $20 I'm not going to be that worried.  Apple stock often falls by high amounts after giant hype based increases.  There's nothing technically wrong with the company that is shown in a price change like that.

When Reitman's (a Canadian retailer) started dropping in 2018 there were some longterm concerns with how their business was operating and how it didn't have a real plan to compete with Amazon for sales.  A person might consider having sold this stock in 2018 at a loss at $3.50 to prevent further losses.  In November 2020 the same person could have picked up the same number shares for 1/20th the cost (which is a risky bargain stock given that it's also in bankruptcy reorganization)."

Again, Apple's jump in value after announcing their split ultimately caused me to sell off shares, which I ended up being able to buy back again at a lower price.

Upwork's jump in value caused me to shed half that position which I haven't repurchased so far.

And Tiptree's current jump in value has been one that I think I understand, so rather than selling, I've continued to be a buyer. With that said, even after recent purchases in the $12 and $13 range, my cost is $7.36/share.

My point being, prices go up for different reasons. If, after evaluating all the available reasons for the price increase, it makes sense to you, then no reason to sell, and maybe even buy more. But if it seems like it's run up for no reason except enthusiasm, maybe take some off the table. Again, I know nothing about Calix except the price history that I googled just now.

NYSE: NCLH

News:  Recently received proxy vote information for Norwegian Cruise Lines, as follows:

Items:

1. Election of class II directors, nominees Adam M Aron and Stella David and Mary E Landry.
2. Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers.

3)approval of an increase in our authorizes share capital to increase the number of ordinary shares authorized for issuance from 490,000,000 to 980,000,000.

4)Approval of an amendment to our 2013 Performance incentive Plan (our ""Plan"") including an increase in the number of shares available for grand under our plan.

5) Ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting for for the year ending Dec 31 2021 and the determination of PWC remuneration by our audit committee

So, its looking like Norwegian is looking to eventually Dilute their shares through selling more shares, adding +100%, as I read it.

2021-04-26 06:01:29,stocks,"Haha just in 2021 I have too many to count already. Some I'm sticking with long-term, others I cut and moved on. My strategy has always been to hold if I genuinely believe in the company long-term, but if I'm holding just due to some emotional ""it's not a loss unless I sell"" bs then I just accept my f\*ck up and cut it and move on. Otherwise imho the opportunity cost is too great - you could be investing that money elsewhere and actually making decent returns.

So anyways, my mistakes of 2021 so far:

**BB** **(cut) -** I admit it, I got caught up in the reddit hype and bought in at $15+. At the time I was justifying it to myself by getting confirmation bias from all the reddit DDs saying they had a huge number of patents, were going to be leading the way in self-driving software etc. But obviously since then it's cratered.

I cashed out at a 40% loss as whilst I don't think this stock will drop much further, equally it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere anytime soon. It's a legacy tech company that is making no money, has a lot of patents but patents are worthless if you can't monetise them, and mediocre leadership (CEO himself was selling stock as the price peaked). So really I think my cash could be invested better elsewhere.

**COIN (holding)** \- bought in at $390 hoping it would spike, of course it didn't. However I bought in more at $300 and am holding long-term, on the basis that at a $100bn valuation this was probably over-valued, but now it's barely worth $50bn which doesn't seem crazy compared to companies like SNOW and even PLTR (more on the latter below). Of course it's very much dependent on the crypto market so is definitely a speculative investment, but I don't think 40-50% gains from here over a few months is unrealistic. I mean their Q1 21 profits were *insane.*

**PLTR (holding) -** bought in at $35, partly because of reddit hype but also because it is a *fantastic* company - Peter Thiel and Alex Karp are veritable genuises, and they really have a huge moat - there is no-one out there who can offer comparable tech currently. Also for all the IT guys on here saying big F500 companies can build their own equivalent software, I would say - have you ever worked for a big corporation? IT always gets the minimum amount possible spent on it (seen as a cost center) and plus data is usually dispersed across numerous legacy databases etc, and nobody has the willingness/skillset to fix it.

Having said that, I acknowledge this is still speculative because of one thing - *valuation.* I love the company, but even I have to admit they are still expensive at $40bn. If the stock price doubled that would make them an $80bn company, which even for an elite data science/machine learning outfit is a pretty pricey valuation (especially given they're not making much in revenue/profits currently).

***AMC (cut)*** \- again bought into the hype, took a big hit but decided to cut and move on. Ok cinemas are reopening, but AMC now has a similar stock price to pre-covid which isn't really justifiable, plus I dont have much faith in the management (CEO paying himself huge bonuses  during the pandemic etc). FYI, for people looking for a better cinema play would check out *Cineworld* (I don't currently hold a position but might do shortly) - listed in the UK but they own cinemas all around the world, particularly in the US. Have a lot of debt so speculative, but their price is still well below pre-covid levels at least.

**TSLA (holding) -** think everyone knows Tesla by now, so no analysis needed here. Bought at the Feb peak but the market crashed, holding long-term though as even though the company is expensive at these levels think they have huge future potential.

**NIO (holding) -** same as above."

I started buying in the 20‚Äôs then added 1/4 of my original share count at around 15, 10, and 8.50. Brought my average down pretty low and I‚Äôm happy with it now for a long term hold. This worked because the price was dropping despite only good news from the company in recent months. Valuation was impacted by interest rates and bearish outlook on both SPACs and EV startups, all macro-risks that will fluctuate throughout my holding period.

2021-04-26 11:17:41,stocks,"I bought Tencent (HKEx) at it's peak (475HKD) back in early 2018. Subsequently, news about the Chinese govt clamping down on gaming etc. brought the stock down to 260HKD at it's lowest at Oct 2018 and it traded sideways or down most of 2019. Then we had the Mar 2020 crash, but today Tencent is at 628HKD (was 750 in Feb) even after more recent clampdowns in China.

If you believe in the company, just hold or DCA."

Bought 1000 shares of MMDEF in January at$3.21/share. 

Wrote the following in my spreadsheet where I track purchases/sales:

""Why? Because it's fun to be crazy once in a while. Also, stock has applied for full NASDAQ listing "" \[for those unfamiliar, this is a small Canadian company developing therapeutic uses for LSD.\]

Dropped to low 2's in early April. Bought another 500 shares at $2.48 about two weeks ago.

Last week they got their NASDAQ listing. Stock instantly shot up 80+%. Up about another 30% today. Sold all my shares at $4.62/share for about 56% gain.

Sometimes crazy pays off!

Needless to say - this is not investment advice."

I do believe DNMR has the potential for massive growth, the problem is that it‚Äôs a green/eco friendly stock. No matter what it will cost more than the traditional plastics and thus it‚Äôs appeal is in the story for these big companies, not the function IMO sadly. I honestly think if these companies couldn‚Äôt advertise they are making green choices they would not do it. While I believe PHA bioplastics are better than petro plastics- if the narrative is broken by WSJ and these short attacks I don‚Äôt think the company can fall back on being the best price, most efficient etc. They are selling their story (which I believe) and I worry the ‚Äòstory‚Äô is changing when viewed by the general public.

So, i did some GME and made $2500 or so.  Then it dipped and I still had some.  So, I figured it would rebound and I doubled down, throwing another five grand at it, more than I had profited.

Currently, 11% of my pre-tax income goes into said 401(k) with a 5% match from my employer, 3% of my post-tax goes into an employee stock purchase program, and an additional $50 from each paycheck goes automatically into my individual investment account. Also through my employer I get granted stock yearly (usually about $700 dollars), but since that has to vest for a year before it‚Äôs mine, I don‚Äôt really count it for anything. 

In total, I have about $2k in my individual account and $4k in my 401(k)... not a lot, but it‚Äôs more than nothing. 

In my individual account I‚Äôm bought into mostly mutual funds/ETFs (FBALX, FBMPX, FSMEX, and SPY) and a few individual stocks (AMC (before the whole WSB mania), SBUX (through my employee stock purchase thing), and a penny stock that is about to be listed on NASDAQ (cannot post the ticker/name or the post will be removed). 

I was lucky enough to escape college without any loans and am currently lucky enough to have very low living expenses in comparison to my income, leaving me with quite a bit of my income going into my main savings account.

Edit: both accounts are through Fidelity, if that makes any difference!"
2021-04-26 00:14:57,stocks,To me it looks like you are contributing too much to your 401k. Get the employer march maxed and put the rest towards a Roth IRA. Best thing for you to do at your age is put most of your funds into a total market fund.

1. Emergency fund 
2. Employer 401k match 
3. Max yearly Roth IRA contribution 
4. Investing/saving for short term goals (car upgrade, house, etc.) 
5. Max 401k

Obviously it‚Äôs up to you, but I personally started increasing my 401k contribution while saving for a down payment on a house. Also it may be worth it to split your 401k contribution between a regular 401k and a Roth 401k if your employer offers them."
2021-04-26 19:59:51,stocks,"Use ETFs over MFs in your individual, they are a tad more tax efficient because of how they trade in baskets.

As for ESPPs, sell them as soon as you can and view them as a bonus.

2021-04-25 20:08:56,stocks,"So you contribute 6%, they‚Äôd give you 6% - got it. If your budget is squared away and you can see all the cash flows, it can make sense to contribute to the Roth first then get back to the 401k from a dollar-allocating standpoint. If you‚Äôre not getting the employer match in excess of that first 6%, focus on the Roth then look for your next goal to be filling your 401k fully (19.5k legal limit this year)."

2021-04-26 09:59:42,stocks,"Please note 401k and IRA plans each have Traditional and Roth versions.

I think in this case maxing 401k is the clear winner over taxable due to OP being 22 and having all the time to grow that higher capital base"
2021-04-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Which stocks will be the safest from economic anxiety? (higher inflation and capital gains taxes) A lot of people are worried about higher inflation and higher capital gains taxes. My question is, which stocks are most at risk, and which stocks are safest from the economic anxiety?

My guess is that ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù growth stocks (such as innovation and tech companies) would be hurt the most by economic anxiety, while more stable dividend stocks (AT&T, Walmart, McDonalds, Coca-Cola, et cetera) will be safer. Am I right about this?"
2021-04-25 20:22:50,stocks,"I think many investors are too new at this and have not been through the kind of crap coming our way.  In 2008 bunch of people were surprised.  In 2000 bunch of people were surprised.  I got my shock/intro way back in 1987.  History repeats itself now with a whole new batch of investors.  When their investment accounts lose 60% of their value they are going to be in shock.  Depending upon the timing of the crash, getting taxed for gains that have disappeared since they were earned in the prior year."
2021-04-25 22:27:53,stocks,Oil thrives in inflation
2021-04-25 22:08:32,stocks,Historically an increase in capital gains taxes does not have a long-term negative impact on the market.
2021-04-25 23:10:47,stocks,Inflation and capital gains taxes will impact all companies and individuals.  There is no escape.  That is why there is so much concern about them coming now that Biden is unleashing his 43% cap gains tax proposal and trillions in spending to be completely funded by money printing.
2021-04-25 21:43:13,stocks,"Find value stocks.  Below 20 P/E, with 5 year growth in revenue, income and cashflow.  Next calculate the average cash flow over 5 years and multiple by 20.  If it's below the current market cap of the company, it's a possible buy. That shows it's a good, growing company with a below value price.  In a down turn these companys will do fine as they are now over valued."
2021-04-26 00:19:07,stocks,The one that you don‚Äôt look at every day

2021-04-26 00:22:49,stocks,Dont forget CP and CNR (CNI for U.S)
2021-04-26 01:25:55,stocks,"If the spike in inflation is only brief and transitory like the fed is expecting, then it probably won't have any long term impact. However if inflation picks up more than expected then the fed will have 2 options. 

1. The fed does nothing and lets the economy run hot. This will probably add to the existing asset bubbles. Cash and bonds will become even less appealing than they already are and push even more investors further out the risk curve chasing returns. Stocks in general should do well, but commodities, consumer staples and stocks with decent dividend yeilds might do the better.

2. The fed lifts rates to ward off inflation. This would reduce demand for assets as some investors that had been pushed out of fixed interest due to low rates/returns rotate back in. At the same time, some investors that are leveraged to their limits wouldn't be able to sustain the higher costs of borrowing. (More of an issue in real estate). In this case stocks in general will probably not do well, but boomer stocks or companies with low leverage will probably fair better than others.

Of course this is hypothetical and the fed are not expecting inflation to spike to that level. As for the capital gains tax, I think that's just people being vocal about paying more taxes and unlikely to change anyone's investment decisions."
2021-04-26 01:41:38,stocks,IBM is a terrible company but their stock just goes up and pays high dividends.
2021-04-26 03:15:57,stocks,WM. Very few red days.
2021-04-26 04:49:30,stocks,I think you are right. Value stocks remain stable (at least on longer run) while growth stocks will suffer from inflation. In theory bank stocks should grow due to inflation when banks increase interest rates...but I would not rely on that and I would not recommend to buy bank stocks at all.
2021-04-26 09:07:47,stocks,Stocks that are close to solving a real problem. Like a therapeutic pill for the COVID-19 variants. Or a company like $ARDX that‚Äôs got an upcoming PDUFA deadline for a chronic kidney disease issue that comes up quite frequently.
2021-04-26 11:19:29,stocks,"There is no safe in stocks :). 

What seems ""safe"" (such as traditional banks) is the deadliest."
2021-04-26 16:30:22,stocks,Utility stocks are generally considered safer and a haven in tough markets but the returns generally aren‚Äôt great over the long run because of the limited growth potential.
2021-04-26 00:10:02,stocks,[removed]
2021-04-26 04:14:19,stocks,"Just IMO, but I think Covid messed up a ton of the basic indicators and ""guidance"" the market has. Not only because of the huge sell-off in 2020 followed by the insane rise, but especially with the crazy amount of new investors. I believe we are running on a borderline that could go either way, but I wouldn't say this is the same as 2000/2008 simply because the market is not randomly boosted to an exorbitant amount, but these 2 factors played together and caused it.

I think its most likely to see a decline in small cap stocks, a sorting out of growth stocks of those that really have potential and those that just hoped to grow, and a constant gain in big cap stocks, but less than before. If you look at the amount of new people per sub it's mostly the ""affordable"" stocks that got hit by huge increases due to new investors, and I think there will be a big wave where they pull out because they realize small caps and penny stocks are no money printer if you don't exactly know what you are doing."
2021-04-26 04:02:45,stocks,"You've been in this game for a while then if you saw 87. I'm 4-5 years new, but I'm heeding you wise men. I've heard so many people talk about 2000,2008 and all the same signs. 

 I'm out of the market bearing it out right now. 

Valuations seem crazy to me and I really don't understand how things can keep going up from here. I see stagflation on the horizon as well as a bunch of other red flags with geopolitical tensions, possible increasing commercial real estate defaulting, and possible increasing developing countries defaulting."
2021-04-26 08:36:23,stocks,Nice plan brains
2021-04-26 00:57:40,stocks,"When inflation rises its head, initially inflation can‚Äôt be passed down. But it will. When corporations get a tax increase it will be sent down and prices increase. So expect inflation. 

But the real question is will the inflation persist? I say a year. If that. But we will be back to a deflationary environment. And that is my bet. I don‚Äôt expect inflation to persist. I think it will revert back to the recent mean. So investing that way. 

My point is that inflation is transitory. It doesn‚Äôt have to be permanent. I can agree you should get put and then get out quic"
2021-04-25 20:31:35,stocks,"ALL bank stocks are currently sitting around ATH. ATH take a hit with ALL market downturns.

Personally I'd find a consume staple with a high dividend and near 180 day low region."
2021-04-26 10:51:47,stocks,"If the Fed lifts rates, Bonds become more viable which reduces the appeal of stocks.  You can even get a decent return on some CDs (but not inflation adjusted).  The highest returns are in Real Estate and Commodities where you have a fixed rate debt service and an appreciating/inflating asset."
2021-04-26 08:29:40,stocks,Why do you not recommend buying bank stocks?
2021-04-26 04:18:18,stocks,"Economic anxiety means likely bear market. The index will go down. Sure you can tough it out and compound until the economy gets better, but it's gonna hurt watching it."
2021-04-26 08:33:19,stocks,Nice so what's the plan for your money then ?
2021-04-26 13:23:11,stocks,"Just out of curiosity, how long have you been out of the market for?"
2021-04-25 21:36:21,stocks,"Costco is a fantastic company that is WAY over valued.  

Note-Most everything is over valued.  

Also note-Costco is WAY over valued"
2021-04-26 02:34:27,stocks,Walmart dropped 16% from 2020 December highs to 2021 March lows. It's starting to crawl back now.
2021-04-25 21:38:43,stocks,Bank of America and Citi are nowhere near their ATH.  Get it now
2021-04-25 23:48:08,stocks,By this logic I assume you don‚Äôt hold any AAPL GOOGL or AMZN then.
2021-04-26 08:54:06,stocks,"In my opinion they have often poor performance (not all, but many, compared to other stocks)."
2021-04-26 09:24:21,stocks,Waiting untill proper valuations. Nothing wrong with eating a little inflation. Better to be eating inflation compared to losing it in the stock market due to poor valuations. Plus the insane gains definitely balance out the inflation.
2021-04-26 08:41:35,stocks,Is it true that a lot of WalMart store's have containers full of military equipment in the car parks and tunnels underneath them connecting each Wal-Mart so that the military can easily attack any community they want ?
2021-04-25 23:08:06,stocks,For what it‚Äôs worth. I own shares of Costco. I get it. Tons of fanboys that love Costco but you have to be real with the stock.
2021-04-26 09:19:24,stocks,You first. Let me know in 3 months how it's working out.
2021-04-26 09:17:20,stocks,"No, neither do I like the companies overall."
2021-04-26 10:13:01,stocks,"You can make money in a declining market...a LOT of money.  Study the value of put options and be selective for the stocks you use them on.  You'll weather this fine.  Staying out of the market is not wise in my opinion.  Better to at least buy Puts for 2023 or some other hedge.  When the market craters you want to be able to buy quality.  If you prepare now, we'll be listening to Cramer interviewing you in 5 years about how you made millions on the 202X crash."
2021-04-26 10:37:45,stocks,I would buy some gold and comoditys stocks that have intrinsic value in that case as the is a lot wrong with holding worthless paper banknotes The real inflashion could be 25% per year for all we know you should stay in some type of income producing assets imo.
2021-04-25 21:37:29,stocks,"Different customers for each, silly comparison"
2021-04-25 20:11:21,stocks,You can't use anecdotal evidence to back up a statement like this. It's simply incorrect.
2021-04-25 21:30:07,stocks,How‚Äôs this get downvoted? Lol Walmart owns Sams club as well no? I‚Äôm bullish on both companies but Walmart is a machine that appeals to the masses imo.
2021-04-26 08:46:51,stocks,A Walmart within a Walmart. That‚Äôs inception right there.
2021-04-26 11:30:28,stocks,both up huge today! You missed it

Tyson is mentioned a lot in this category as they have invested in some private companies, but I believe they are using this more as a hedge and not sure how quickly they‚Äôd be able to adapt to a switch from ag to lab grown meat"
2021-04-25 20:13:00,stocks,MITC is on my watch list.
2021-04-25 22:57:38,stocks,"I'd at least want to eat it first before investing in it..  

maybe in the future MCD or YUM will be offering lab meats"
2021-04-26 03:58:04,stocks,"My personal favourite is Agronomics (ANIC on LSE). I have read Jim Mellon's book Moo's Law, and I firmly believe that cultivated protein will beat out farmed animal protein within two decades. Mellon's company, Agronomics, is an investment firm that has a lot of shares in the companies that I think have the most promising intellectual property in this field. An investment here is also a good way to not put all of your eggs in one basket.

Full disclosure, I am currently building up a position myself."

2021-04-25 21:53:55,stocks,Damn I need a portfolio size where I just look for random sectors to buy for fun lmao
2021-04-26 05:29:19,stocks,"If it makes money I hope you find the right investment. I find it rather repulsive. Lab grown anything never rivals that which is grown in nature. There is a happy medium, a factory farm is not the only other option. And since most of humanity knows this, I think this is a dead-end street towards investing. People are not gonna jump behind lab grown meat.  Well, the big corporations will. And if that's where you like getting your meat from, if you regularly go to the store to buy Tyson garbage processed meat, then maybe lab grown meat will be the thing."
2021-04-26 11:39:25,stocks,"I really like Beyond meat products, so I invested in them. They have partnerships with a lot of fast food chains (McD, Starbucks, Carl's Jr, Subway etc.) as well grocery stores (Target, Walmart, Kroger etc.). I don't think the company is profitable yet, but the growth is definitely there and I believe plant-based or lab-grown meat is NOT going away."
2021-04-25 22:31:46,stocks,You lost me at the title where you claim lab grown meat. Nope.
2021-04-26 06:44:59,stocks,"Other than the ethical incentive there is no reason for lab grown meat to exist.
And the potential consumers (vegans) wouldn't want to eat it anyways"
2021-04-26 02:56:19,stocks,"Honestly, I think the more a company makes a stink about how environmentally friendly or ethical the product is, the more problems they'll have selling it. And I say that purely as a non-political prediction. I think the best move is to make whatever the minimum disclaimers allowed and just sell us the nuggets. When the price is right, we won't ask as many questions as we think we will."

2021-04-26 04:35:42,stocks,I agree. I think this is something to revisit in 10 to 15 years.

2021-04-26 17:08:20,stocks,"Many (most?) vegans don‚Äôt eat because of the ethical implications. There are a TON of environmental and cost benefits if science can make this a reality. If you are looking for proven business models and zero risk technology, maybe you should go to a dividend investment subreddit."
2021-04-25 20:17:13,stocks,"I'm sure there will be labeling laws, but if they can make it taste indistinguishable from real meat, I think they'll get mass market acceptance quickly. People will eat it up."
2021-04-26 05:09:48,stocks,"I agree but there's a happy medium in between lab-grown and faeces-ridden which is where the majority of meat sits.

Personally I don't think I'd be tempted by lab-grown meat. I'd much rather eat meat from a high-welfare farm."
2021-04-26 05:54:16,stocks,Fearmongering. Do you work for a lab that makes meat?  I see little other reason to trying to scare people into something unless you have a financial gain in mind.
2021-04-26 04:42:40,stocks,"Because it‚Äôs so unnatural and like something out of a horror film. Years ago, when I was a kid, someone started a rumor that KFC used lab grown meat. It was not true but I was horrified.  I just had this image of headless, skinless chickens hooked to tubes and flopping around. I realize it‚Äôs not like that but still, no. I prefer to eat all natural meat that hasn‚Äôt been given hormones or antibiotics, growing it in a lab is just too much for me.

lol, that first comment really got a lot of downvotes. I guess most people are ok with it, not me and to each their own."
2021-04-26 07:39:50,stocks,"As soon as lab meat is a single cent cheaper than real meat, real meat will be done as a mainstream product. 
Its sad that this is the reason LM will take over the market, but in the end the result is what matters.


Start up companies predict the break even price to be achieved within 2-4 years.
Of course they are interested to give optimistic predictions - but it is happening."
2021-04-25 22:21:46,stocks,Any supermarket in Europe is basically like whole foods. Americans don't really realise just how shit and processed their foods are.

2021-04-26 05:30:01,stocks,Your dystopian meat is exactly how they produce their chicken now.
2021-04-26 04:57:19,stocks,Yeah because wasting meat with feces and cysts in it is just wonderful.
2021-04-26 08:34:55,stocks,"I think you may be jumping the gun a bit. From what I understand lab grown meat could replace various forms of ground meat, but steaks, roasts and unprocessed meat is safe for quite a while. 

Any idea what percentage of meat sold is processed as ground meat or sausage? Would it be as high as 25%?"
2021-04-25 22:37:50,stocks,Exactly. Everyone downvoted that guy but America is way behind on that. Most of the preservatives and things we do to food is illegal in other countries. Not even mentioning how we package and label sugar in such obscure ways to try and trick people into thinking it's healthy. The mass population is completely blind to this for some reason and doesn't understand why diseases and birth defects are so common.
2021-04-26 08:41:30,stocks,"This isn‚Äôt true.  shop at Tesco, Lidl, Schwarz, Asda.  They are closer to Walmart than whole foods. There are stricter government regulations on foods, but in terms of processed foods there isn‚Äôt much difference."
2021-04-26 05:34:57,stocks,"No, it‚Äôs not the same. However, I‚Äôm aware of the horrible conditions that a lot of large scale operations keep their animals in, I‚Äôm not ok with that either. Like I said, I prefer meat raised in good conditions."
2021-04-26 05:31:01,stocks,"You eat meat with feces? That's pretty terrible.  Like most people, I do not. I also don't eat meat grown in a laboratory."
2021-04-26 05:13:52,stocks,"So you‚Äôre on board with lab meat for sanitation reasons, that‚Äôs interesting. I get your point but it seems to me that cells used for meat would create some waste as well but then the tissue isn‚Äôt within an organism that has evolved a mechanism to get rid of waste. But you‚Äôre right that it‚Äôs gross to eat animals that are poorly kept and cellular waste isn‚Äôt the same as shit."

Thats over a year old. 

And I don't have the numbers, but Id be way over 50% for ground meat/sausage/processed beyond recognition. A cow doesnt mainly consist of prime cut, let alone a pig."
2021-04-25 22:58:23,stocks,"it's actually pretty funny, I live in Ireland and some stores sell niche American snacks and foods and they have to slap a big ass ingredients label on top of where the original (American) food label would be because the American label doesn't have to declare all the preservatives and random filler shit like corn starch that they add to everything"
2021-04-26 01:53:12,stocks,Birth defects are common? The fuck?
2021-04-26 07:29:38,stocks,"Euro-ape here.

Yeah whole food is the future, I spend ~double the money on food of what would be needed because I go for wholefoods and cruelty ""free"" where ever I can.

Having said this, the reason is that artificial stuff is not there yet, the body isnt understood well enough and industry doesnt give a shit yet about long term health impact of their food. But they know the days they can make money like that are counted.

Development in this direction is happening in lightspeed. The gut system is one of the most studied human medicine fields at this very moment, aside from corona. The industry isnt sleeping, they know they need to provide healthy food in the future or they are out.

And especially with meat and fish the bar isnt very high. Honestly its hard to create something more poisonous than a fish farmed salmon that grew up withoug enough space to swim in a pool of water consisting of mainly fishpoo and antibiotics.

Wild fish die in masses just when they approach fish farm territory because its so infectous.

Other animal products arent much better.

Im balls deep into precision fermentation, crispr and lab meat and I sleep very well at night. 30% ups or downs do not concern me the least bit. Itll come much faster than you imagine.

There is some good analysis out there by Tony Seba (Rethink X) if someone is interested."
2021-04-26 08:35:03,stocks,"I‚Äôm not so sure.  I live in the U.K. and there is sugar in everything and it‚Äôs harder to find healthy small brands.  I think this is a stereotype of American food.  

If you judge American garbage food vs U.K. garbage food... surprisingly they are both garbage.  Perhaps it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm in Scotland, but people here eat a lot of garbage food."

2021-04-26 09:49:57,stocks,I was going by the meat section in my grocery store where I see about 25% or less processed and ground meats of different kinds.
2021-04-26 08:52:20,stocks,"I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs actually high quality from Lidl.  At whole foods you pay a premium knowing the farming practices.  You know the cattle was pasture raised and grass fed.  Other than government policy on cattle farming you have no such assurances from Lidl. I have to go to a butcher and spend the same premium (and a little more) for the same assurance in Scotland.

Edit: I haven‚Äôt researched differences in cattle farming regulations in the U.K./Europe/US"
2021-04-26 05:40:27,stocks,"You obviously don't know the meat I eat. And that's what's pretty sad. Do you think I live in the ghetto? Do I live on the street and eat out of garbage can? No, like a great number of people, I happen to know where my food comes from.  Your talk of feces means nothing to somebody who doesn't buy factory beef.  But trying to scare people is a time honoured way of getting one's way. It has no currency here though, not with me."
2021-04-26 05:46:35,stocks,"And our bodies are covered in microscopic mites, bacteria make up 2% of the human body, the amount of rat shit legally allowed to be found in cereal is not zero but you just have to soldier on through life."

I feel like it‚Äôs common knowledge that there will be a crash within the foreseeable future, and Greg Diamond (a technical analyst) says it‚Äôll be May 10.  The article I read went into some detail on chart similarities between the dot com crash, 2009 crash, and the current Covid crisis that pointed to a potential crash around that date.  Any ideas?"

2021-04-26 01:26:06,stocks,"Its interesting if he can keep marketing the idea. Basically a self fulfilling prophesy that wouldnt have happened if no one marketed it. 

Truth is, stocks are highly valuated right now. PE of the S&P is over 42.... thats definitely crash territory in normal times. But there is argument over whether or not earnings will correct enough to pull PE back to normal. This is really hard to say. Yes people will go back to work and yes earnings will improve, but the problem here is that I am not sure it will be as much as people think.

I think what Covid did was push money to other stuff and that stuff will now shrink while old stuff will recover. I think the overall correction to earnings will be 20%-30% tops once all the dust settled. It wont be 50% like some predict because a lot of that didnt really go away, it just shifted to other companies that work online.

So lets say 30%, then the PE would drop to about 29-30... which is still very high.

Then there is the argument about interest rates. Money being printed out the wazoo for corporations, and people not buying bonds. Both would then push money to stocks since there is no where else for it to go except that and real estate. So maybe... if interest stays down low for a long time, then maybe stock valuations are reasonable? Thats the argument. What happens interest goes up and people buy back into bonds though?

The self fulfilling prophesy thing might be interesting to watch. Lets see if he can spread the world around enough for it to happen."

2021-04-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Selling Covered Calls on Indexes to Beat the Market There are numerous studies showing that in the long run, almost nobody beats the market, so investing in various index funds is generally the best strategy.

Wouldn't selling far OTM covered calls on index funds make it reasonably probable to beat the market in most years?

Granted, far OTM CCs provide a small premium, but it is still technically beating the market as long as you don't lose your shares. Even if you do, there is a good chance that the price dips back below the breakeven point at some point, especially if you time CCs with unsustainable spikes.

For example, many indexes had a several week run recently that had at annualized return of over 100%. There is clearly no way that rate is sustainable, so selling CCs on a run like that seems like an attractive strategy. 

I realize the percentage return might be small, but once a position gets large enough (likely if you have most of your portfolio in index funds), this strategy can either provide some extra income or can be used as a DRIP to increase shares every month, week, etc.

Now, there certainly are some risks to consider.  If you do lose your shares, you might have to pay short-term capital gains. However, you could always just close or roll the CCs. While this would be a loss, that might be attractive to offset any large short-terms gains you might already have. For example, I had huge gains in January and February. If my index CCs end up ITM, I can close them to offset short-term gains, while still holding my shares for long-term gains.

The other risk of CCs is that you generally have to be willing to hold the shares until expiration, which doesn't matter for index funds since they are generally held long.

Is there anything I'm overlooking? I don't hear much about this strategy. Normally the advice is ""don't sell CCs on shares you don't want to lose,"" which is good advice, but seems overly restrictive.

TL;DR

Selling low-delta CCs on index funds seems like a great way to slightly beat the market. Are there any non-obvious risks with this strategy?"
2021-04-26 06:49:36,stocks,"Being ‚Äústuck‚Äù in a position is the main reason not to for me. 

I do sell lots of covered calls, but it is not risk free. 

You generally make the most money on high IV stocks. But the problem there is that the stock can collapse too, and you are stuck holding because of your covered call. 

Then you can take a stock like AAPL. I don‚Äôt want to sell AAPL at any price point close to what it is currently. If I sell calls at a very high price way above the current value, I make just pennies per contract. 
Now, in turn for those pennies I am forced to hold the stock - what if a life situation comes up where I need that money and can‚Äôt liquidate ?

What if a massive scandal breaks that AAPL has been cooking their books for years ?
Of course that‚Äôs not going to happen, but that‚Äôs the risk you take holding a covered call.

Most people don't exercise their options, they sell them at whatever they think is the peak value. As the expiration nears the chances of getting exercised rises substantially.

I typically keep my CCs expirations at least 1-3 months out. I'm looking for that time value premium and the right time to roll is when the stock is rising and optimism is high. Fidelity has a whole article about this strategy. In the case of a bear market it's hard to decide what to do though- if you didn't have the foresight of a protective put then you're kind of stuck in a situation where holding the equity doesn't pay and selling CC's at a low price doesn't make sense.

&nbsp;

The [items of business](https://i.imgur.com/5wxsOvY.png) for the meeting include an approval from stakeholders to allow the company to **increase the number of authorized shares of common stocks**. This is what is called a [share dilution](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp). 

Going further through the proxy statement document, we have the details for Proposal 4 ‚Äî Approval of an Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock **from 2 Billion Shares to 4 Billion Shares** https://i.imgur.com/6Myo5r7.png

&nbsp;

>Description of the Proposed Amendment
Our Charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to two billion shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
and two million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.
On April 7, 2021, our Board adopted resolutions approving an amendment to the Charter to **increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares. Our Board is recommending the
proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to provide adequate shares of common stock
for general corporate purposes, as further described below. The Board determined that the Proposed Amendment is
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and directed that the proposed Amendment be submitted for
adoption and approval by stockholders at the Meeting.**

...

>If our stockholders adopt and approve the Proposed Amendment, the Proposed Amendment will become effective on the
date that it is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware

...

>As a general matter, the increase in our authorized but unissued shares of common stock as a result of the Proposed
Amendment **would enable the Board to issue additional shares of common stock in its discretion from time to time for**
general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, *expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions,
including shares we would be obligated to issue* **in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited**; stock
dividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional
capital. Such issuances would occur **without further action or approval of our stockholders** and would be subject to and
limited by any rules or listing requirements of Nasdaq or of any other applicable rules or regulations.

...

>Failure by the stockholders to approve the Proposed Amendment would reduce the ability of the Board to take the
potential future actions to issue additional common stock discussed above.

...

>**The Board recommends that you vote FOR the approval** of the Proposed Amendment to increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares.

Please go through the document by yourselves (link at the top). I am not experienced, nor that smart. I did not read everything in the document.

I am thinking to vote for approval of proposal 4. In my opinion it is good for the long term. Please remember you are responsible for your own financial decisions. I hold a low amount of shares, and I'll be holding for the long term.

Edit: today's green day brought the price above the resistance line at $614.24. Consolidation in the 600-640 area looks good for the next 2 weeks, unless news catalysts. I am not experienced so make of this what you will.

Just because they'll be authorised doesn't mean they'll all at once issue a massive flood of stocks. It would hurt their own pocket. 

If they wanna acquire a new company they'd either have to take on a ton of debt, which would ""devalue"" your shares. Or issue new shares to buy, which would ""devalue"" your shares the same amount but without the debt burden of interest and such... (which one would you prefer?)

BUT it doesn't actually devalue your shares, does it? 
You take on new debt or issue more shares, you end up with more cash as a result. You end up with a smaller slice of the pie, but it's now a bigger pie. So where do you lose?
Whatever they buy will add value to your shares.

Disclaimer: Very, very simplified view but hopefully it'll stop people freaking out about this. Happens all the time, which is why (trusting) management of a company is so important."

2021-04-26 04:19:46,stocks,"Do we trust Nvidia‚Äôs management to use these shares appropriately? I trust Jensen to lead the company, but why do they need to do this?

With currently 2 billion shares authorised for issuance against 619M shares outstanding, we already have a possible dilution of your 1 share being worth 0.236 shares. If they‚Äôre authorised to issue another 2 billion shares, then that brings us down to 0.134x worth the value before issuance. This is an extra ~56% reduction in our share of equity on top of the possible ~76% reduction we already have.

To see how this is even remotely something worth voting for, in my view, Nvidia would have to increase operating earnings/FCF by at least the same multiplier at which they dilute our shares. Simultaneously I would also like to see them maintain their high return on equity, be able to retain a larger portion of their earnings and if not return that portion in the form of buybacks and dividend payouts. Hopefully if shares are used for mergers, that management can recognise when our shares are overvalued and the business to be acquired undervalued, then mergers will be of great value for us.

Taking such a possible dilution cuts your portion of wealth and ownership significantly and I, and I think many of you also, would like to see a great return for it.

If the extra shares weren‚Äôt included for use in executive and employee compensation I would feel a lot better about this proposal. The option of lining their own pockets at the expense of your investment still exists."

I felt like it was a perfect time really after a streak of great news priced in making this stock skyrocket, now no further good news on the horizon, and potential big bad news looming (for the stock, not so much for the company to be fair). I had a gut feeling they are at a high peak, and news of them mass issuing new stock soon just solidifies this conviction imho.

2021-04-26 05:21:37,stocks,"Well.. Kinda..

In theory, it should not drop (in practice it does). Here is how it should go in theory: company market cap = #shares * price. So if market cap is 5B and company goes and creates additional 100% shares and sells them for the current price the company gets 5B cold cash to their balance sheet. Yes, there is now twice as many shares. But in theory, the company is now 5B richer, which would make it twice more valuable.

Basically, when they issue new shares and sell them for something, yes your ownership percentage goes down, but the pie (company) gets proportionally bigger so that your ""equity"" would stay the same.

In practice it's never like this, since company's market cap is almost never equal to its equity. It's value is not it's equity, until you get into liquidation scenarios..

EDIT: Also in practice, a lot of companies are setup in a way where they claim that their 1 share is worth 1 dollar (or 1 penny, basically a small number not tied to their actual stock in any way), so the company can in theory just add a number of shares with no additional equity and sell it to anyone they want, including their directors or owners, who now paid a minuscule sum for a large amount of shares and yeah the shareholders are left holding the bag."

2021-04-25 22:07:54,stocks,I think the point is that it grants flexibility to the management for acquisitions. If you think the only thing stopping the management team from dropping shares out of a helicopter is that the shareholders have yet to authorize more shares then I'd assume you're not investing in the company. It's raising the cap and then trusting the management's discretion to only use it if it's wise to do so.

I finally got my act together and started investing in late January to build a solid nest egg for retirement. I‚Äôm 34. Half of my IRA is in Vanguard ETFs (predominantly VOO), but as I was new to investing, I supplemented VOO shares with VTV (value ETF) and VYM (dividend ETF) for additional diversification.

Is this necessary, or am I better suited to just convert these shares in the more sector-specific ETFs into more VOO? I‚Äôve also considered VTI, but I like the dividend in VOO since the other half of my IRA is in mostly individual growth stocks that don‚Äôt yet pay one.

Thank you for any and all recommendations! This sub has taught me a lot as I begin my investing journey :)"
2021-04-26 01:55:57,stocks,"Totally up to you but you should understand that the more involved you are, the more research you will need to do. IF you have no time for that, stay in general stuff like what you have now.

If you want to make much more than market then you need to invest time to do that and at that point you want individual stocks. Funds have fundamental issues, such as holding bad companies due to being in a certain index.

Funds usually follow rules and buy stocks based on rules which dont take into account changing fundamentals. For example, anyone without blinders could have told you that brick and mortar retail was going to suffer long term, 2 decades ago and many big names indeed went under... yet they were still part of these big index funds as they decayed... Thus if you could pick your own stocks, you probably would have avoided the things like Sears, Mervyns, Neamans, Brook Brothers, etc etc and your gains would have been better if you had similar stocks but not the obvious long term turds.

Again, it just depends on whether or not you can do the research. Otherwise, trades are free today so there is nothing stopping anyone from simply making their own diverse portfolio that matches any fund they like without any management fees. Your fee will be your time which may or may not be worth it. Depends on how much you have invested and how much you make I suppose."

So there is some reports that apple want to change iMessage and they are going to give it a fresh update. Apple wants iMessage to be more like a social media site and I think this could be a worrying situation for Facebook or it could flop for Apple.
Here's the link for the rumours

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/22/apple-reportedly-expanding-imessage-to-compete-with-facebook.html

Let's go to why I think this could be a success if apple plays their cards right. 1st reason is apple has good brand loyalty let's look at when they removed the headphone jack and brought airpods In. At first airpods got a lot of hate it didn't look like it was going to be a success but after time airpods itself can be a 100$ billion dollar company. Apples phone are a big success and there's no slowing down and finally iMessage it's self is a big success. Iam from the UK so iMessage isn't that big like it is in the USA WhatsApp is the bigger one and it's the same for the rest of the world but in the USA iMessage is big and that's also were Facebook makes most of their money. When apple release the new update I could see this being a success they could also steal users and screen time from Facebook and the other social media sites like Snapchat. I personally think Snapchat is in more trouble because most people use Snapchat to message only and if apple make iMessage look more attractive people could start leaving Snapchat.




On the other hand this could flop. One reason why I think it could flop is because iMessage is a closed ecosystem and if they keep it closed people wouldn't leave WhatsApp or Snapchat because they still want to message their friends on android. On the other hand if apple decide to open iMessage people could sell their iPhones and buy androids.

Another reason why this could potentially fail is because many companies have tried to compete with Facebook and they have all failed like Google for example they failed their attempt at a social media site."

2021-04-25 21:32:35,stocks,"Flag/pennant patterns are chart patterns that show a stock hit a high off of a short term breakout (where the resistance line starts) before correcting downward and hitting a support price (where the support line starts). The stock recovers and drops again, and it may happen again. Importantly you can draw a straight line between the support lows and the resistance highs. The theory is that (in a bull market) the stock stays within that range for a while before a breakout occurs. Flag pattern is pretty easy to read because the resistance line and support line are very close (nearly straight), while a pennant shows a decreasing resistance and increasing support.

As with all chart patterns, they can help you, but like anything in the market, you can also lose."

Ofc remember these are interchangeable markets, maybe equity investor will want to book some profit and again rebalance after earnings and sell tech to buy bonds this time too. I think there will be a smaller drop compared to last time. Recall that AAPL was at a much higher price point ($146) last earnings when it started to drop, so it has more room to fall."

2021-04-25 20:37:29,stocks,"You want it to be right in the range of 30-60%. Any higher and they could not be able to pay them off in the future. Especially for a newer company. They‚Äôre being conservative because like another user said, this sector of healthcare is challenging. Some of these patients stay sooo long in these facilities that it makes it damn near impossible to pay off their debt. However, CTRE is managed very well and takes this into account with growth and debt. They speak about it in their letters and their 8k/10ks. 
Now why do they have the lower price/ffo? It could be because their outpacing their ffo. Could be because they just haven‚Äôt been discovered as much as the other nursing facility REITs (this is most likely). Or the other REITs seem like the safer option. I believe it to be a mixture of all three. Another thing to consider is this sector was beat down quite a bit by covid. Covid made it incredibly difficult to move patients to these facilities efficiently. You had to have negatives, some people did not want their family members there due to how many were dying in them and wanted home health, and others. This is going to change in the future. We are getting closer to being through the pandemic and thus the hindrances will be lifted. If you look at CTREs numbers, this doesn‚Äôt appear to have effected them as much as some of the others. They‚Äôve been able to be relatively filled and collect their rent. This will just be better in the future. This is one of my highest conviction stocks and I got in around 12 and have held and will hold."
2021-04-25 22:54:26,stocks,"Dang, nice entry!! I appreciate you taking the time to respond. I agree that healthcare REITs are a good long play, but I'm trying to judge if your choice in CTRE is the right REIT to invest in with money now. If healthcare REITs were on my radar back when it was $12/share, I might not be as hesitant, but CTRE is almost at an ATH.  

 I have a few questions on your statement though, if you don't mind.

""Some of these patients stay sooo long in these facilities that it makes it damn near impossible to pay off their debt."" - Since CTRE owns the property (and don't manage it?), why would it matter how long the patient stays? I get if a patient doesn't have insurance then someone has to pay for the cost, but I would think that would be on the business, not CTRE as the property manager. And yeah, if the business can't pay their bills then CTRE starts to lose money (businesses missing rent), but there's a level of safety there because they're just the landloard, untied from the business performance (unless the business is going out of business, of course). Am I wrong in that thinking? 

""If you look at CTREs numbers, this doesn‚Äôt appear to have effected them as much as some of the others "" - The CTRE stock price has recovered from their per-COVID levels (and is almost at ATH). Comparing the recovery to some other healthcare REITs, CTRE has recovered better (most other REITs are close to their pre-pandemic levels, but haven't surpassed them yet by 10-15%). So is that what you mean by that COVID didn't hit them nearly as hard as the others? Or are there other factors that you're looking at to say they weren't hit as hard by COVID? The fact that they're above their pre-pandemic highs and near ATHs makes me a little nervous jumping into it. Seems like some of the other REITs certainly have more room to recover compared to CTRE. I get this is a long play, but if I had $1k to drop on a healthcare REIT, why wouldn't I pick one that's not as recovered, knowing that recovery is right around the corner?"

I don't know what the frustration here is, though. The risks for BABA are that it either gets de-listed or the CCP bankrupts it intentionally. Of these, I see the risk of de-listing to be much higher than the CCP bankrupting it intentionally. Right now I'm looking at a situation where I'm more concerned about the U.S. screwing western investors over rather than the CCP screwing western investors over. When I frame it like this, neither scenario is something I'm particularly worried about.

Way I see it is there's plenty more upside potential than downside risk. I'm not betting the house on BABA, but it seems a reasonable place to park some money in the current market."

That said, I have concerns:

* Military/Political controls...i.e. follow the money.  The CCP follows the money and they are just as addicted to money as any government in the world.  If the CCP has determined that BABA is a ripe and easy target to get money from, they will.   They may call themselves communists but they are Capitalists, yes, with a capital C.   They are also Controlling, with a capital C.
* Like MercadoLibre, we may have to settle for the idea that many countries/cultures will have their own localized 'Amazon'.  We may wish BABA could become the Amazon of the east, but the competition is stiff, and the margins are thin."

2021-04-25 21:20:09,stocks,"They have the same holdings in their portfolios but no they are not the same. VTSAX is a mutual fund and VTI is an exchange traded fund. There are important differences to consider depending on how you want to invest.

2021-04-25 23:15:24,stocks,"You can, and should, compare them yourself: 

https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vwo

https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vxus

With VWO you are basically investing in China (40%) and to a lesser extent Taiwan (17%) and India (12%). 

With VXUS it is way more diversified. Europe is spread out across the nations at roughly 30%, with Japan being the largest single country holding at 16%. But the other emerging economies are still included (China is still #2 at 10% for example).

So it's really a risk calculation...do you want to buy into an XUS portfolio that is 40% China? Or do you want those European and Japanese companies?

Personally I hold both. VXUS makes up about 60% of my international holdings and VWO makes up about 20% to give a little extra weight to China. 

The other 20% goes into FRDM which is another emerging markets ETF that excludes countries with poor human rights records (top holdings: Taiwan, Chile, South Korea, Poland). The idea is that these nations will see faster economic development as the result of greater intellectual and economic freedom compared to places like China and India (in fact, India was just recently removed"
2021-04-25 21:19:36,stocks,"> One is fund another one is ETF. 

They are both funds and there are very important differences.

VTSAX is a **mutual fund** and VTI is an **exchange traded fund**.

Mutual funds like VTSAX generally have minimum investment amounts (usually $3,000 for Vanguard mutual funds). They also allow you to automate your investments by buying fraction shares. 

They are also less liquid like you suggest as they do not trade at a discount or premium throughout the day on the market. They only trade at NAV which is usually calculated at the end of the day.


None of this is true for exchange traded funds."

2021-04-25 22:02:34,stocks,"Over a ten year time scale, it truly doesn't matter. I got into investing by putting 10-20% in the markets each pay check. If you're sitting on thousands or more in cash and want to jump in, I agree it isn't the right time. But incremental purchases over 10 years (240 paychecks aprx) it truly doesn't matter if the market crashes by the end of the year because you'll have years of purchases at the absolute bottom. 

I trade options only these days, so timing the market matters. But for long term investing, it's regular additions in high quality equities that matters most.

Edit: Berkshire Hathaway doubles roughly every 5-7 years... I'm comfortable putting money in every 2 weeks, rather than waiting months for a possible dip only to see it run up 5% missing opportunity. This isn't highly volatile spec, it won't lose 70-80% of it's value during a correction. I've been buying puts AND calls on SPY for the last month expecting the big correction that still hasn't happened. Expected the same for BRK but it also hasn't happened."

You keep going back to that when I literally wrote in the first line of the last comment that it was not about storage, but greedy business.

Livestock is not ‚Äúa‚Äù stock, livestock is stock, just like bone broth is stock. They share the word, they don‚Äôt share the meaning. Derivatives is not synonymous with hedged equity, equity is just equity, of which you hedge the fair value (refer to ‚Äúfair value hedge‚Äù as described in IFRS 9). The derivative does not magically turn into equity, it‚Äôs just a right to buy equity at a certain fair value: note the difference. 

I stated that a dutch company issued the first stock, which clearly implies that they issued the first portion of equity to public, it does not mean they were the first to hold chickens.

Apple caught up because they had the money to buy the talent in the industry, and then pay TSMC whatever the asking price was for the entire capacity of their latest node. Its impressive what Apple did, but only Apple could do that."

If the merger goes through 0.73 Douyu Share will be equal to 1 Huya, so it you really convinced that the merger will happen, buying Douyu might be more worth it. 

If the merger do not go through, I think Huya is better positioned. They have agreements with Riot Games over streaming LoL eSports and the Demacia Cup which is huge. The Chinese love some LoL. The CAGR of Huya is insane too, but I can't remember it off the top of my head the exact number. 

There has been rumours that Huya is looking to move into video hosting as well and a platform to challenge Tiktok in China.

2021-04-25 21:46:48,stocks,I fully support his investing philosophy and recognise his success in founding Vanguard. But we are talking about money here so Bogle is nothing more than a salesman. His ultimate goal or Vanguard or any ETF managers is to attract more people to buy them. There is no such thing as low risk or guaranteed investment.
2021-04-25 21:33:15,stocks,"Respectfully, do you understand how index funds work? As I wrote, Vanguard, which is the standard, will incur $4 in expenses per $1,000 invested. FZROX is zero, as in no cost. So Vanguard is .004 whereas FZROX is 0. 

They're passive vehicles and require little in the way of fees. I think you're greatly overestimating the cost of these index funds."

2021-04-25 21:54:56,stocks,"I understand how math works.

If the index charges expenses I'll always underperform what is being indexed due to the expenses.

Ending value (gross) $3,554,374.48

Cost of fees $33,234.80

Your fees as a percentage of ending value: 0.0093503935

For starters, there's no guarantee you beat the market. In fact most don't. If you end with $3.5 million and have to pay $33k in fees I'd say you're doing well."
2021-04-26 08:36:19,stocks,"Your calculations are possibly off.

100,000 at 9.6% for 30 years yields roughly 1,464,287.

A difference of 280,653.

So how is it you figure that you're only paying 33,234.80 in fees? 

I didn't go with your extra complicated formula. I'm guessing you're maybe off by a decimal. 332,348 might be plausible if you were adding an extra 10,000 to the pot each year.

Those fees add up and they guarantee underperformance."

Just legitimately asking for more information because from what I've researched the average retail investor that wants a life without thinking about idiosyncratic risk in their retirement fund should stick with passive index funds. 

Otherwise you need to live and breath the market and or the companies you chose to invest in for 30 years... And even then statistically speaking you probably will have underperformed vs VTI or VOO."

An option gives you 100 SHARES of a stock. 100\* 3400 = $340,000 of AMZN for one call option!! that is literally like buying a small house. Lack of liquidity from this just makes the stock price more wonky and is not helping anyone in my opinion.

Like I fully expect a Witcher game to bring people back and money to flow, and that is coming, but that could be 5 years from now. I doubt cyberpunk is currently bringing in a lot of NEW money after the launch, I know the launch was a financial success but its not a game that I think will continue to sell after all the bad PR. Cyberpunk was supposed to have a standalone multiplayer with microtransactions, but earlier this year the CEO said things have changed and they are wanting to simply add multiplayer experiences to their single player games, basically it looks like they are wanting to move away from an almost mmorpg GTA online type of game to a p2p co-op and possibly instanced mode, game wise both are fine, but I dont see how you can monetize the later very well. Also they are actively trying to fix cyberpunk, which means paying employees to fix a product that isnt bringing in new money, its an awkward situation at best.

I see potential for a buyout at some point, but its still too expensive, and the MSFT bethesda deal was a far better value due to all the IP and history. Also with how big CDPR is in Poland, im not sure if the company would sell to foreign company like MSFT or EA

Basically, I see value in their next witcher or other game, but I dont see where they will be making money till then, and the next game likely is years away."
2021-04-26 10:20:07,stocks,"Well if you're going to follow Cramer, he also says ""own Apple, don't trade it"". 

Your intention doesn't seem to be about trading it to buy back on a pullback, but in having portfolio discipline.  I wouldn't necessarily be scared at 11% concentration, but you need to determine what your risk tolerance is for you.

If you do decide you want to sell, perhaps consider selling covered calls (presuming you have at least 100 shares).  It allows you to capture a little extra upside, and if it drops...you got some premium while your holdings drop back to a non-outsized position.  When it rises again, sell more calls.

If dropping 100 shares is too much, I would wait until it finishes another strong run (obviously hard to call a top).  AAPL is trending up but isn't at an all time high.  Unless you're losing sleep over it, I would wait to see what it does after earnings this week.  If it has a strong pop after earnings, probably your time to trim.  If not...again, you're probably back to a position you can leave alone until it becomes an outsized part of your portfolio again.

At the end of the day, do what works for you, and whatever allows you to sleep better at night without worrying/thinking about it."

Plants will just always be cheaper and are nearing a level of efficiency governments will likely be considering incorporating them into their infrastructure in the next 10-20 years. Ignoring subsidies, they're already around the same cost as real meat. If they keep getting cheaper, even the biggest of meat-loving states will start considering a shift."

For example

You own 1 share out of 20 outstanding shares of a **100B** *(or market cap)* company. This shows that you own 5% of the company and your share price would be **5B** per share.

The company **buybacks 10 shares**. Now, their outstanding shares are down to 10.

Now, you own **10% of the company** since you have 1 share out of 10 outstanding shares of the company.

From 5% to 10% ownership, your share price will increase from **5B to 10B per share** since you now own 10% of the 100B company.

It's supposed to be safer, not almost as safe. Tesla primps its statistics to con people who don't know better.

Their system also still drives under trucks. So Tesla will be paying every dime in profit to the estates of the people murdered by its cars, after waving their bogus stats in front of the jury.

This is troll-speak and is why I will not be communicating with you further.

The stunning revelation imputed by Templeton is that Tesla's autopilot is only as safe as a human driver. And you subsequently ascribe death rates that would be the same if a human were driving as ""murder"". Even though putatively the same number of people live or die whether the autopilot is used or not.

Like I said, I don't feed the trolls.

As I stated before, when some other company has even a tenth as many autonomous driving miles as Tesla, and there's safety data for those autonomous miles, get back to me, and I'll look at the data. In the meantime, I consider you a troll, full of hot air and nothing more."

It depends on your risk tolerance and your age. If we look at ARK‚Äôs ETF‚Äôs as an example of growth ETF‚Äôs, we can see that in the February correction most ARK funds lost 20%/30%. Now, we don‚Äôt know how long it will take before it reaches new highs (and if it even will, while highly likely). If you‚Äôre already quite old and need the money soon, then you may not have the time to wait for a rise again.
