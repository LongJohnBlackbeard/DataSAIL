04/03/2021,stocks,Honestly as a short term play I am extremely bullish on AMD it‚Äôs true value is triple digits and this earnings and meeting 4/7 may be solid catalyst current holding a bunch of amd may contracts
04/03/2021,stocks,"I always try to think of a bear case when I want to buy a stock.

My thoughts
Intel came out with a new consumer processor (mid range product actually competes with AMD on price and performance) Intel's Tiger Lake CPUs seem to be doing well in laptops.
Intel's 10nm server Ice Lake is supposed to come out coming week? There is some news.
These are all the headwinds in the short term
Question is, how much advantage does AMD have? Can they take significant market share or is the advantage already priced in?
Their forward P/E is at nearly 50. How much will their earnings hurt if fed increases rates?
Biggest headwind is, how much are they hurting due to the chip shortage, how much money are they leaving on the table?

Having said all this, if Intel doesn't do well, AMD likely will do well. Their plan for the next 2-3 years looks solid. If you are willing to hold on, you might see some good gains"
04/03/2021,stocks,"It will definitely be a 3 figure stock in the future, but probably not short term. It's all about if they outperform what the ""analysts"" are saying and their EPS. Same thing with more stocks. If people like what they see and where the company is going, they will buy. If that's how you feel, buy!"
04/03/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt think they will reach triple digits, but they should go higher eventually they were trading higher pre Covid, so as things open back up should get better"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Taking profits looks good when you look back in hindsight, I‚Äôve done it and shorted stocks and made money, I‚Äôve also sold and never got a re entry because it shot up. 


My wife buys stocks and just forgets about them, and we‚Äôre fairly even on profits made over the last year, I‚Äôm trying the buy and hold strategy now and just BUY MORE when it dips"
04/03/2021,stocks,I think that there‚Äôs something to be said for partially cashing out to hedge against potential losses for especially volatile positions
04/03/2021,stocks,"Every individual is different.  Some are traders, some are investors.  If u are a trader, u take profits. If u are an investor, you buy solid companies with great management."
04/03/2021,stocks,The most profitable trading accounts are owned by dead people and people that have forgotten their password. Statistically it‚Äôs not selling but it‚Äôs not a hard and fast rule and if taking some profit puts you at ease it‚Äôs a good idea.
04/03/2021,stocks,"I live by this rule:

Cash out your INITIAL investment and let the play money ride.

Not going to tell you what to do but I‚Äôm 40 and could retire tomorrow.  Find some stocks you believe in and literally set.it.and.forget.it."
04/03/2021,stocks,"The problem is everyone would profit-take ideally because that‚Äôs the point, but nobody knows when to do so, so taking profits only really works if you get lucky or can time the market. otherwise you invest in something long-term and adopt the never sell soon approach"
04/03/2021,stocks,Pick allocation targets and rebalance regularly.
04/03/2021,stocks,"You don‚Äôt lose what you don‚Äôt sell, at least that‚Äôs what I live by"
04/03/2021,stocks,Both... adapt and improvise.
04/03/2021,stocks,Take profit at 10%. Never less than 5%. Loss limit of 5%. Seems ok but I'm down 30% in portfolio this year so grain of salt added.
04/03/2021,stocks,"This is why professional money managers recommend having a target allocation to stocks and bonds. When stocks take off, your allocation is out of wack with too much stocks. Sell high and buy into bonds. Stocks crash, sell bonds and buy stocks low."
04/03/2021,stocks,"I think it's statistically proven that holding and buying over time is the best way to go about it. Don't get me wrong, I have a Roth as a retirement account and a few other sources of income. As I'm still young I am very appreciative of the things I have. 

But with my regular stock account, with money I'm okay risking, I think taking profits would only be beneficial in the long term. I'm very active on the account, so having that extra cash on hand would always be useful for another correction/dip whatever may come. It would only secure money made."
04/03/2021,stocks,"I am fortunate enough to be both, the portion of my portfolio that I would be taking profits on is not my entire portfolio. I have my investments that I am not thinking of selling anytime soon and put in a bit regularly. 

I just also have some money on the side that I'm willing to risk, and I never took profits much. I'm learning that it's ok to sell if you feel you made something."
04/03/2021,stocks,That's crazy.  Never heard of that before but it makes sense.  Lemme just lose my password real quick...
04/03/2021,stocks,"Can i ask when you started investing and has your strategy really changed over the years? I‚Äôm 17 and of course developing my own strategy and risk tolerance, but so far i‚Äôm leaning towards a set it and forget it style in long term funds, ETFs and such"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Definitely good advice, but I usually don't make initial investments, I buy in regularly. I'm not sure what this would look like for me because I usually just buy more when it goes up and buy more when it goes down, all little by little. 

I'm not really the kind of guy to just set and forget, I'm pretty active with what I invest in."
04/03/2021,stocks,This. ^
04/03/2021,stocks,"I disagree, for me personally it's sell when it's green and buy when it's red. The market and specifically certain sectors go up and down, there are bear markets and bull markets for growth stocks. 

What I'm trying to say is that I'm confident all of my growth stocks that dropped will have another rally. If something rallies and I like the amount that I made, I could take some profits and simply wait until I want to use that money. It would be more buying power.

I think one of the biggest reasons people don't take profits is just FOMO of even bigger gains, but I don't have that philosophy. In my mind, money made is money made so taking profits when I get them to have more buying power/more cash on hand during a sea of red would help me out. It's not really luck."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Ok, but don‚Äôt die."
04/03/2021,stocks,There‚Äôs also a few articles about animals picking stocks in funny ways.  They outperformed paid stock professionals.  Not by a little either lol.
04/03/2021,stocks,This requires growth though.  If you pick wisely or luckily? You can get your initial out quickly on other picks could take years or never.
04/03/2021,stocks,"It can be red and still above your original buy in price not to mention taxes on profits. Smooth brain math says you have to buy the dip that‚Äôs dipped past the tax expense of the sell and buy back in.  
Starting with 10 profiting to 15 and buying back in doesn‚Äôt result in a net of +5 after taxes.  
Time in market>Timing the market"
04/03/2021,stocks,That was my second option!
04/03/2021,stocks,"Just looked this up.  A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at the Wall Street Journal.  Lol!

Edit: Actually that was just a hypothetical, I think.  One real study I found was [a cat](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2013/01/15/cat-beats-professionals-at-stock-picking/?sh=5d1aaa0621ad) who actually did beat experts in 2012."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yes, I should have clarified, but assumed it was obvious.  Your initial investment might not see returns swiftly, but when it does take ‚Äúyour‚Äù money back out and continue."
04/03/2021,stocks,Lol üòÇ
04/03/2021,stocks,Yeah! I thought it was a monkey and a dart board haha!
04/03/2021,stocks,Buy VOO
04/03/2021,stocks,"Since you are based in Europe, you are not allowed to buy ETFs listed on US exchanges (like SPY, VOO or QQQ). This is the reason why you do not find them using your European broker.
You have to find their equivalent listed on European stock exchanges.

For examples, the biggest ETFs for SP500 listed in Europe are CSSPX, VUSA, IUSA

You can find the best one for you using a ETF screener"
04/03/2021,stocks,"You can‚Äôt buy SPX, it‚Äôs purely an index. SPY and VOO track that index and allow you to invest. They are both great options"

04/03/2021,stocks,"There are multiple sites with databases on ETF. Look for one in your country and then do a search for the index S&P. Copy the IDentification No. of the ETF you selected to your broker.

Or go to the sites of the investment firms directly and learn about there ETF. In Europe it‚Äôs Blackrock, Vanguard, etc."
04/03/2021,stocks,"In the states, buy VFINX."
04/03/2021,stocks,"We can trade US ETF‚Äôs, just complicated shitty taxations, used to have ARKG on Saxo. But yeah, way better to find EU equivalent than trade US ETF."
04/03/2021,stocks,Well actually i can. I use Saxo and i can easily search for stocks on NYSE and buy SPY.
04/03/2021,stocks,Is there any reason why SPX is 4000$ and SPY is 400$ ? is one better then the other ?
04/03/2021,stocks,"can you explain a bit why is it better to find a EU equivalent ? you get taxed on the profit you make regardless if the stock is in US or Germany, unless i misunderstood."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Nice. I use DeGiro and another European broker and I am not allowed to buy US ETFs. 

I'd like to buy them because they offer a wide choice of sectors and have greater liquidity"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yeah, you can easily buy any stock on NYSE/Nasdaq/etc using any European broker.
But you should not be able to trade US ETFs. Have you already tried do place a order to buy SPY?

Maybe it changed if you are based in UK after the brexit

You should get this error:

04/03/2021,stocks,"They are the same companies but spx is an index and can't be directly bought or sold other than options whereas the spy is an etf that can be traded. The prices should be almost the same but the spy is at a fraction of the spx. Same companies. Same percentage of portfolios. Same, same, same. Obviously SPY is more popular because it is cheaper and can be directly invested in."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Could be a completely different underlying asset. You mentioned something about futures, which are options not stocks. I understand you want an ETF which is rebuilding the S&P 500. So look for an ETF which rebuild it with physically buying all the stocks. To give you an example: IE00B5BMR087"
04/03/2021,stocks,"i see, i didn't knew about this. i might just call Saxo's customer service just to be sure."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Ah ok, so when you say options is it the same as call options ? like pay a premium and exercise in 2 weeks ?"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yes, European options work a bit differently than American style. But same basic concept.

I‚Äôd look in to the progress of industrial vehicle companies before going all in on a speculative company.

Investors are making the same mistake with green energy IMO. Expecting a small green company with an early stage product to take over the energy space from the likes of giants like Exxon etc. Oil companies will develop their own products and compete or even possibly overshadow upcoming companies. They‚Äôre not just going to lie down and die. They‚Äôll shift just like everyone else."

04/03/2021,stocks,"Ok, my apologies. I don‚Äôt know of a pure play charging option in China"
04/03/2021,stocks,No worries thanks for your comment !
04/03/2021,stocks,"The first one is true. However let‚Äôs say you did buy the dip after you sold at the peak, it‚Äôs not a wash sale. Wash sale is only on a loss. 

But let‚Äôs say you sold for a loss, bought the next day and then lost more and then sold again. All the losses add up. 

You never really lose a loss, it just stay as a paper loss until you close out the position. 

Make sense?"
04/03/2021,stocks,"So tax harvesting is selling losers WITHOUT triggering a wash sale so you actually get the write off. It‚Äôs just a fancy name for realizing losses to take a deduction. 

You are correct on how wash sales work, but the loss is just rolled forward into the cost basis of the next trade. So say you do this 5 times, and each time the sale is washed. The loss is rolled forward each time. EVENTUALLY you stop buying that stock or similar security and then all your loss is realized, assuming you didn‚Äôt profit it all away. Makes sense? 

Buying an option in a stock is the same thing as buying the stock (substantially similar) and will also trigger a wash sale.

Example
Buy $100 option, lost it all. Cap gains are -$100
20 days later, bought $100 call again, sale washed cap gains are $0 new cost basis is $200.
Lost it all, cap gains are now -$200
Repeat 5 times into December...cost basis is -$1000 and you are actually $1000 poorer, but cap gains are $0 (not -$1,000 cause its washed) and you don‚Äôt have enough time left in the tax year to let it be realized (30 days)

So here is the problem it causes. On another trade unrelated to your poor options choices, you made $1,000 so your cap gains on that trade are $1,000

You owe cap gains taxes on $1,000 since your washed -$1,000 has washed into next year. You get to take that loss when and if you stop wash selling it.

So now imagine you are doing this with $190,000 ES futures contracts 20 times a day....it can be troublesome. 

If you heard nightmares about people getting big tax bills, that‚Äôs cause they accidentally rolled all their losses into the next tax year through wash sales. Hard to do, but it could happen, especially if you were just scalping ES futures all year, the sizing is huge. You don‚Äôt want to wash those losses.
(Edited)

Also!! Never accept this as tax advice. Talk to a pro, cause there are other limitations and tricks."
04/03/2021,stocks,"If you buy a stock and then sell it for a profit, it cannot be a wash sale and you have to lax taxes on that profit. Wash sales are when you sell for a loss and then buy back in, effectively preventing you from harvesting your loss without committing to the sale."
04/03/2021,stocks,Just do whatever you want. You‚Äôll never get caught.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Thanks man, I was just wondering I don‚Äôt plan on day trading or anything like that. But just wanted to make sure say in the future something like covid happens I sell right before everything drops and then buy the dip."
04/03/2021,stocks,So I bought AMC at $20 and sold at a loss at like $10 as it was crashing. Then I bought it again at $12 and sold at $14. My Fidelity app says this is a wash sale. But I‚Äôm still out like $200. I can‚Äôt claim the loss right?
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yeah just wanted to make sure, I don‚Äôt plan on day trading or anything, just buying blue chips and etfs."
04/03/2021,stocks,"> The loss is rolled forward each time. EVENTUALLY you stop buying that stock or similar security and then all your loss is realized,

One exception: if you are dumb enough to sell at a loss in a taxable account and buy back in an IRA, you never get to use the loss as a deduction."
04/03/2021,stocks,All good on that one!
04/03/2021,stocks,"Let's say 100 shares. Bought for 2000 sold for 1000, currently -1000. Bought for 1200 but the loss is added to your cost basis so its 2200. Sold for 1400 reducing your total to -800. You now have an 800 loss unless you buy within the 30 day windows."
04/03/2021,stocks,"How many shares in each transaction?

If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing, I‚Äôd recommend doing the math for each transaction. If the entire position is closed out, the final number should represent the whole loss with no wash sale at the end. 

If not, fidelity might have some rule you need to call about."

04/03/2021,stocks,"This probably will help you more and explain SPAC's

Look at article 3.

&#x200B;

Also, I'd recommend looking at CHPT. I watched it post-merger, and waited until it dropped to around 22 (SPACs usually drop post-merge). CHPT will most likely come out ahead in all of this.

People like to quote fast charging or ad revenue, but the grid can't support having level 3 chargers everywhere. CHPT sells home chargers and also offers level 2/3 charging. Also, they have the biggest network and have an old board member on Biden's administration."
04/03/2021,stocks,"1. On the contrary, each of your stocks (once the merger executes) will be a normal stock like in any other company. Of the company's total stock pool, 25% will be owned by people who invested when it was TPGY. Each individual stock is a larger fraction of company ownership than was CHPT (when it was SBE), where individual investors only got 10% of the company.
2. If you're asking this question here, no. If you had millions you could have been involved at an earlier stage, but for us regular joes TPGY is it. I guess I'll point out the existence of Warrants, which are like company-issued options that let you buy a share for $11.50, currently these are trading around $7. Do your DD to understand the risks involved."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Thanks. Actually I hold some shares of CHPT.

I am now thinking about TPGY. EVbox operates mainly in EU whereas CHPT in US

I looked at paragraph 3 and I understand that this 25% refers to sponsors. So, for us, if we buy TPGY, what percentage of EVbox will we own?"
04/03/2021,stocks,Some convert past prices to reflect the split. Unless the charts will show a 67% drop in price. It was $746 or so before split.
04/03/2021,stocks,Have you ever noticed their logo? It's a paint can pouring over the earth that says COVER THE EARTH.
04/03/2021,stocks,Good short candidate. Thanks for the tip.
04/03/2021,stocks,Ty
04/03/2021,stocks,"It's not a short. 
Splits typically increase price as it makes price more attractive for buyers.. lol

You know how splits work right? it was 3 to 1 so if you owned 1 share at 750/sh, now you own 3 at 250/sh.

Shorts didn't make any money from split.
Many stocks rise after splitting because it makes price seem 'more' affordable for retail. Tesla way to up post split, AAPL as well."
04/03/2021,stocks,Wow really? Was my second favorite for calls. What do you see that I don't?
04/03/2021,stocks,"My comment had nothing to do with the split, it was in reference to the ticker."
04/03/2021,stocks,Makes it easier to buy 100.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Just a guess but selling calls should be profitable.

Considering markets are generally cyclical, this is long overdue for a pull back."
04/03/2021,stocks,I think a pullback on SHW would be reflective of a broader pullback in home improvement. I don‚Äôt see that happening until the current real estate craze settles down (or pops!).
04/03/2021,stocks,Exactly. Worst short you can make right now
04/03/2021,stocks,Doesn't appear you read the news...

OP: ‚ÄúIs choosing risky assets with large possible gains a potentially lucrative decision?‚Äù

Yes. The answer is yes.

Don‚Äôt risk more than you can lose as said time and time again."
04/03/2021,stocks,Your expectations are very unrealistic and your strategy does not make sense.
04/03/2021,stocks,You're investing over 3 years in a company that is not a household name in America? Oh boy.
04/03/2021,stocks,Investing is a marathon not a sprint.
04/03/2021,stocks,That's what I do. But most folks don't have the stomach or testicular fortitude for it
04/03/2021,stocks,"Suppose you want something that costs $100,000. If you can't have it, nothing else really matters. For some reason you can't or don't want to loan the money. You have only $10,000. In this situation it is rational to put all in a high risk high reward investment."
04/03/2021,stocks,"So are you asking 

"" guys I can make sure big profit in this stock should I do it?"""
04/03/2021,stocks,Investing can be anything you want it to be. Just different goals and differ strategies.
04/03/2021,stocks,I knew people were doing it but I wasn‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôs as risky or as rewarding as it looks to be.
04/03/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs exactly my plan. I want to put in $1000 a month until the portfolio hits $300k then bail out and invest in safe Dividend Aristocrats.
04/03/2021,stocks,Gambling is not investing. Going all in is not very smart
04/03/2021,stocks,"It‚Äôs just as risky and just as rewarding as it looks. However, from a risk-adjusted return standpoint, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to do. Basically, you‚Äôre not compensated to take on this much risk, from a return standpoint. Not to mention you make a huge assumption that the market will continue this way. Another big problem is 3 years is a very short timeframe. Look up probability of being in the green over a variety of timeframes and you‚Äôll see what I mean. 

All that said, if you‚Äôre comfortable losing all your money on this, you‚Äôre not borrowing to enter this position, and you won‚Äôt panic sell/shit your pants if it drops 50% or more, sure why not? It‚Äôs your money."
04/03/2021,stocks,"I'm not sure if my advice is then best for you. If you can't have $300k, you probably still welcome having a smaller sum. Do you really want all or nothing?"
04/03/2021,stocks,Any stock market investing is gambling
04/03/2021,stocks,I completely understand what you mean. As a noob I‚Äôm seeing the market on the up and up with some downs here and there but overall as long as there isn‚Äôt a huge downturn or crash the net result is positive growth. Correct? Insane the crash during COVID but the market recovered in 6 months and who ever held on to their stocks is doing better now then prior to Covid.
04/03/2021,stocks,I feel like he didn‚Äôt understand what you were trying to say haha. Ironically he tends to have things backwards: your probability to realize a gain is higher the longer your timeline so why not ride out high growth the whole time? Why transition to dividends at a specific dollar amount and point in time? He should choose to start in that instead. Overall very confusing approach and seems to be pretty greedy imo
04/03/2021,stocks,I guess I had the intentions of getting out before a major crash. Since I‚Äôm buying high risk high growth stocks I‚Äôm only thinking 3 years ahead before bailing out safely. I guess if the numbers and economy continue to do well I‚Äôll continue to stick with it.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Not really. Especially if you have a long term portfolio. Investing in the short term is ""gambling"""
04/03/2021,stocks,"That was the fastest recovery the US has seen and it was mostly due to massive stimulus and QE from the Fed. 

Market isn‚Äôt the economy. While there‚Äôs a very good chance the economy will roar out of the gates once people are vaccinated en masse, market still needs to have proper grounding in the economics for it to continue growing strongly into the future. 3 years is too short quite frankly if you look to the tech bubble bursting or the financial crisis starting in 07."
04/03/2021,stocks,"1) assuming you‚Äôll time getting out before a major crash. 
2) assuming you can bail out ‚Äúsafely‚Äù in 3 years. What does that even mean?
3) what are your measures of assessing whether the economy is doing well, your portfolio is doing well, and how your portfolio does relative to benchmarks? 

All things you need to think about further."
04/03/2021,stocks,Why? What if you go with high yield high growth stocks with a 10 year history of growth and gains? If you hold these companies for 3 years and triple your investment then get out how is that risky?
04/03/2021,stocks,My goal was to put 100k in high growth stocks returning 30-50% per annum until they hit $300k then sell and invest in Divident aristocrats.
04/03/2021,stocks,I guess as long as the markets are on the up and up from today until 3 years from now will by litmus test.
04/03/2021,stocks,Bear markets can occur my friend.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre not going to get 30-50% per annum, over 3 years. Most high growth stocks did well because rates were near 0 meaning to continue growing, borrowing money was dirt cheap. That‚Äôs not going to be the case going forward and you already see them getting hit, like ARK Invest funds. Your expectations are frankly unrealistic."
04/03/2021,stocks,Don't invest in the VIX. It decays over time and you will lose your money unless you time a rapid decline in the S&P perfectly
04/03/2021,stocks,"If youre after commodities, consider actual physical gold & silver; these serve as an insurance policy of sorts, that cant go bankrupt nor deny you.
I expect prices to drop a little more; up to you where you see an entry point."
04/03/2021,stocks,"If you‚Äôre looking at commodities, don‚Äôt forget about rare earth minerals. REMX etf. Rare earth minerals will be in very high demand for green energy, EV, etc."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Equities are in general a hedge. Specifically, residential real estate (REITs) are decent as well since you can re-price rents every year. If everyone is saying inflation is going to be wild, also consider what happens if inflation isn‚Äôt as bad as people say. You have to keep both scenarios in mind."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Don‚Äôt buy the VIX and unless you also own value stocks, small caps, REITs, and bonds, don‚Äôt dip into commodities. Commodities are higher volatility and lower returning assets in the long run so unless you‚Äôre able to buy low sell high, they may not increase your return long term."
04/03/2021,stocks,If you're worried about inflation/rising rates I'd look at financials and/or inflation protected bonds. Depending on your risk tolerance.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Commodities surely, but they have already gone up, may climb further. Financials, Energy, Materials probably have got some room left."
04/03/2021,stocks,"My view is that if inflation arises the Fed will increase rates and therefore markets will go down ""big league"" When that happens an asset that is viewed as inflation protection such as gold also goes down when markets go down. So i would wait until that collapse happens and then you can buy some GLD (gold ETF)  and SLV (silver ETF) and hold maybe for 2/3 years."
04/03/2021,stocks,MP would be good for rare earth too.
04/03/2021,stocks,Calculate it in excel.
04/03/2021,stocks,tradingview or barchart but how about Level 2 and Level 3 what do you use for that?
04/03/2021,stocks,"That's only helpful if you have access to all of the data for days or hours depending on what period you're using. And when I'm tracking data of about a hundred and fifty stocks, that's not a small Excel spreadsheet."
04/03/2021,stocks,The investment you bought was a Publicly Traded Partnership probably. The K-1 shows your portion of earnings and shit. Yes you need to amend and include the K-1.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Shares in Enterprise Products Partners L.P.  are not common stock, they are units in a publicly-traded limited partnership. As such, unit holders receive a K-1 each year in place of a 1099, which are supposed to be provided to shareholders by March 15th of each year (IOW, later than the date that a 1099 must be provided).

The K-1 includes the details of the distributions that were made to unit holders during the year, which is used by taxpayers in preparing their personal tax returns. This information is provided to the IRS as well. The distributions made to unit-holders from an LP are typically not (or not entirely) dividends, but could include returns of capital, short- and/or long-term capital gains, and other types of income/expenses. 

The K-1 is for your information, and doesn't need to be sent with your return, but the correct thing to do is re-file your taxes with the information on the K-1. Some will say that for 2 shares, the information isn't material and it's unlikely the IRS will come after you. There may not have been much that was taxable in the 2020 distributions anyway,"
04/03/2021,stocks,Nothing to worry about.. As others have said you are a unit holder of a public traded partnership.. think like being a partner of a law firm for example. Even if you don‚Äôt sell the stock you have to report the earnings and losses that the partnership has generated during the year that belong to you. The form itself can be confusing but if you use something like turbo tax it guides you all the way.. the advantage of partnerships is that they get taxed differently than corporations so you usually get larger dividends.. they are common among energy related companies..
04/03/2021,stocks,Yeah that goes with your taxes when you file them
04/03/2021,stocks,If you didn‚Äôt sell any stock in 2020  there‚Äôs nothing to be taxed on only if u sell them ..
04/03/2021,stocks,Mother fucker.. over 2 God damn shares. You have got to be shitting me üôÑ ...fuck me...
04/03/2021,stocks,Yea i got a .90 cent dividend.  üôÑ oh the horror
04/03/2021,stocks,"Okay thank you. This is so stupid. No I know for next time though. Will be selling any and all limited partners  stocks to avoid this headache for next time.. is there any advantage to having them? Or are they best to avoid?

So just to clarify I don't really have to worry about this? Just for my records. Good enough for me! Lol next year ill wait till March to file my taxes hahaha"
04/03/2021,stocks,You get a K1 and you have to claim it on your income taxes even if you didn't sell. I have had K1s for decades and this is the first year that I didn't have to file with them because they either converted like Blackstone or I sold them.
04/03/2021,stocks,I think its easier for me to just never sell so I don't have to fill out this bullshit form.
04/03/2021,stocks,So then why did they send me this form? Dude this is ridiculous. So you mean to tell me they are gonna send me a schedule k-1 for every single stock I own? I own like 60 damn stocks and have traded alot of them multiple times throughout the year??  Should I be expecting a pallet of schedule k-1 forms soon??
04/03/2021,stocks,Sorry bub
04/03/2021,stocks,Technically you don't have to fill it out. There's been years I never reported stock profits but then again my audit risk is low so you have to decide your own risk tolerance.
04/03/2021,stocks,"if the total k-1 is a 90 cent dividend do not amend. worst case you'll receive an adjustment notice from the IRS for computed/reported income on 1099s, etc. vs what you reported with a small bill. if it's total income of $1 not even that."
04/03/2021,stocks,"The reason to have them is that they pay a really high dividend

With only two shares, you're not getting much,  but it's like 8-9% or so of the share price a year"
04/03/2021,stocks,Oh shit. See i thought the robinhood tax forms did all then when you uploaded the file to turbo tax.  ü§≠ good lord man. And it's all for a .90 cent dividend.
04/03/2021,stocks,Why the downvotes? Someone please explain?
04/03/2021,stocks,"Those are probably corporations and not partnerships. A publicly traded partnership is interesting. Sell those shares, amend, and expect another k-1 next year. 

Not worth it."
04/03/2021,stocks,So what about all of my other stocks I own. Isnt every stock publicly traded? What if I didn't sell that stock? Shouldn't I not have to fill out the form since I never actually sold the stock?
04/03/2021,stocks,Yeah its a 90cent dividend. But I think the stock amount grew like 10 or 20 bucks. But I didn't sell during 2020. So yeah as for dividend it was like a dollar lol
04/03/2021,stocks,The guy saying if you never sell then there is nothing to worry about is wrong.  Even if you didn‚Äôt sell you still need to add the K-1 to your return usually.
04/03/2021,stocks,"I can't speak for everyone, but I would imagine it's because LP structures is a fairly basic, 100-level concept. Even the most cursory of research into the company would have told you how they were structured, and the subsequent reporting obligations. I don't want to deter anyone from investing, and I'm not intentionally signaling you out by any means, but it does get annoying to the people who actually take investing seriously when an individual can't even do the most basic of research into the companies they're buying, and then tries to pass off the responsibility as if it's an inconvenience to them that they didn't understand. Partnerships, and the K1s that go along with them, aren't any more or less worthwhile than a standard C-Corp, just different. If this is too much, I would strongly encourage hiring a professional to manage your investments going forward."
04/03/2021,stocks,"A publicly traded partnership is very different than a publicly traded corporation. As a matter of fact, all partnerships are very different than corporations. Corporations pay taxes on their taxable income. Their owners (shareholders) are exempt from taxation until they sell their ownership stake. The sale is usually reflected on Form 1099 sent to you by your broker.

A partnership is a flow-through entity. It does not pay tax itself since all the income ""flows-through"" to the owners (partners). The partners each get a K-1 statement every year and they must report that with their own individual income tax. Even if you do not sell your partnership stake, you must recognize the flow-through items in your schedule K-1 every year and pay taxes on them."
04/03/2021,stocks,"So basically avoid partnerships because they are a headache? 
  How can I tell if its a partnership before I invest?"
04/03/2021,stocks,Yours was a Publicly Traded Partnership
04/03/2021,stocks,"Right so I would not amend - I'm a tax CPA, see it plenty with clients. Not a big deal. The unrealized gain isn't relevant to taxes."
04/03/2021,stocks,"> But I think the stock amount grew like 10 or 20 bucks.

That part is irrelevant for taxes."
04/03/2021,stocks,All over a couple bucks? I thought it had to be over like 50bucks or something for it to be required to pay tax. Like my point is. I really gotta go through all this work just for like a couple of dollars? Like I can't imagine the irs auditing someone over a few dollars. Ya know?
04/03/2021,stocks,"No I understand. And I deserve flack when earned lol. But yeah like I said it was one of my first purchases when I started investing.  As you can tell it wasn't really a serious investment at only 2 shares lol. That's why I'm frustrated. I just wanted to buy something to get started at the time. But its part of learning. Its why I filed my taxes because I didn't expect any k1 form or whatever.. I thought I was done with the stress of taxes for the year..  to be honest i still don't know what I'm doing and what half this shit means. But I'm not giving up.  I really want to learn this stuff. And its situations like these that will teach me for next time. 
     You and other educated redditors with more experience are helping thousands of younger beginners like my self. I understand things seem basic for you guys. But I myself grew up broke and was never taught anything about investing. I can fix your lawnmower but i am not booksmart. When I read tax forms or business proposals my blood pressure goes up. I get overwhelmed and its hard to make sense of the countless numbers and fancy big people words.  But i learn from trial and error.. and its made possible by people like you who take the few minutes to give me a verbal slap when needed.  When I am being dumb I have other people here who can enlighten me of my foolishness so I can improve and change. Yes there was no research done. Yes I'm pissed. But not with you guys. So just remember that. Its just the learning curve I get frustrated with and I'm sure many other people like myself.  You guys are my heros. I've come along way. And after today I will have gained more knowledge.  So just know when you fellas get frustrated with people like myself asking dumb ass questions. Please know that its not going to waste. So don't give up on us dummies!!  üòå"
04/03/2021,stocks,"I assume the stock prospectus? Idk, i dont buy individual stocks, just indices."

04/03/2021,stocks,"Just keep in mind, partnerships have the K1 reporting, but have their own perks. Technically, they don't pay ""dividends,"" buy its essentially the same thing. They pass the tax obligations onto the investors, but in turn have some of the highest payouts in the market."

04/03/2021,stocks,Hmmm ü§î that is a good point ill have to keep it in mind. Does it also have any affect on growth potential? Are they usually slower growing due it not being corp?
04/03/2021,stocks,"Are you familiar with REITs and BDCs? They have different tax reporting rules than MLPs, but it's a similar concept, where the company gets some favorable tax exemptions at the expense of paying out higher earnings. If you're being a stickler, they aren't technically ""dividends,"" but it's a similar enough concept that they're fundamentally the same. Somewhere along the way, a lot of the oil Midstream players decided to list as an MLP and harvest the tax benefits. Lately, a bunch have restructured to more basic C-corps, but MLPs still exist. I'm personally invested in MMP.

Growth may be a little slower than your traditional ""growth"" stocks, but most investors are in it for the income stream, and not any growth in the underlying. For the Midstreams in particular, a lot of their ""growth"" is tied more to the demand for oil, and less any one thing the company itself does. To that extent, they do still expand, adding more pipelines and storage facilities, but growth is typically more  a secondary agenda than the primary goal."
04/03/2021,stocks,"I can not speak to Jinko as a stock or in what will be happening politically. I just wanted to add the perspective of a solar business owner.

Jinko is one of the largest PV manufactures in the world. They are very stable and have been around much longer than many other manufactures. They are some of my favorite modules both from a price standpoint and particularly from a quality standpoint.

While they are a Chinese company, they have manufacturing plants around the world, including here in the us. They employee hundreds of US residents. They are a big part of many [communities](https://jinkosolar.us/about-jinko/) and give back quite a bit through donations and all sorts of other programs they have created in the US

It would be a real shame if we lost them due to politics. After working with them for years they are one of my favorites as I mentioned. I am a bit surprised I never thought of them from a stock perspective. If it was for the politics I would not hesitate to invest in the company."

Now an outright ban on Chinese panels would be negative - but that would just shut down the entire USA solar industry for 5+ years - not going to happen IMHO...

I think the USA will push JKS into opening more capacity here in the USA - right now they have about 400MW? in Florida?

Copper prices rose on 8th Feb as optimism around a US stimulus raised hopes of higher demand for metals and a recovery in the world‚Äôs biggest economy.

The copper price rose as much as 1.3% to $3.6745 ($8,100 a tonne) on the Comex market on Monday, with March delivery contracts back within shouting distance of multi-year highs hit early in January.

The metal has rallied nearly 90% since the depth of the pandemic in March.

Thinning inventories

The rise in copper prices is underpinned by thinning inventories that pointed to higher demand for the industrial metal.

‚ÄúInventories are still quite low on exchanges. That gives good indication that manufacturing demand for copper is present and that its not just a speculative story,‚Äù Nitesh Shah, an analyst at investment manager WisdomTree, [told Reuters.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-prices-lifted-by-inventory-squeeze-2021-02-08)

In China, the world‚Äôs top consumer, copper inventories normally accumulate in the run up to the Lunar New Year as businesses close for the week-long festivities.

But this year, Chinese inventories have [dropped to near decade lows ](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-prices-lifted-by-inventory-squeeze-2021-02-08)on robust demand from factories, which are maintaining high operating rates due to shortened shutdown periods and tighter travel restrictions for workers.

Meanwhile, effects of the [coronavirus pandemic on copper supply](https://www.mining.com/web/worlds-copper-mines-struggle-to-recover-from-covid-19-andy-home/) continues to be felt. In what was supposed to be a year of supply growth, global mined output during the first 10 months of 2020 were 0.5% lower compared to 2019 levels, according to the International Copper Study Group (ICSG).

In Peru, the world‚Äôs second-biggest producer, copper output plunged 12.5% to 2.15 million tonnes in 2020, the country‚Äôs Energy and Mines Ministry said on [8th Feb](https://www.mining.com/web/peru-reports-sharp-drop-in-2020-copper-production-due-to-pandemic/).

Copper miners gain

Despite copper prices hitting a slump in the second half of January, the world‚Äôs top copper producers have continued to rally this year after spectacular gains in 2020.

**Shares of BHP, the largest publicly traded copper company**, are up 6% year-to-date.

Copper, like most commodities, has been a cyclical investment whose demand ebbs and flows with economic cycles. Traditionally, roughly half of all copper demand has come from new building construction and infrastructure, China has been the single biggest market by far. With many global economies in or entering recovery phases, cyclical demand is on the upswing. 

Green initiatives around the world offer a secular tailwind as well. The European Green Deal, President Joe Biden‚Äôs ambitious climate plan, and China‚Äôs target of carbon neutral by 2060 all point to increasing incremental demand for copper. 

Although mining stocks have in many cases quadrupled since their March 2020 lows, many names are still trading below their previous highs, and at a time when fundamentals are improving.

Take [Freeport-McMoRan](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/fcx), $FCX, a Phoenix-based company whose business is roughly 70% copper, 20% gold, and 10% other. The stock plummeted to $7 a share during the selloff last spring and has since recovered to a recent $30. But it is still about half what it was at previous highs of around $60 in early 2008 and 2011.  

The big news on copper last month was regarding $RIO and the Mongolian situation.

Feb 8 (Reuters) - Mongolia's government is seeking to cancel a deal with miner Rio Tinto to expand the OyuTolgoi copper mine in the Gobi Desert and replace it with a new agreement, the Financial Times reported.

[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/mongolia-seeks-more-tax-revenue-from-rio-copper-mine-expansion--source-2021-02-09/rep\_id:3650](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/mongolia-seeks-more-tax-revenue-from-rio-copper-mine-expansion--source-2021-02-09/rep_id:3650)

Many thought this was potentially bad news for $RIO, but it appears it's about working out a little more tax dollars for the government and a deal will be struck.

**The underground expansion will push annual production to nearly 500,000 tonnes per year, making it among the world‚Äôs biggest copper mines**

Global copper demand

As mentioned above, it‚Äôs not likely that copper demand will slow down in 2021.

In the US, new home and home renovation demand spiked since the pandemic started, along with electronics demand. Analysts at CitiBank expect the copper market to shift into a deficit in the second half of the year with a minor surplus overall for 2021, Reuters reported. They also forecast deficits in 2022 and 2023.

The US Census Bureau and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development reported building permits in December increased by 4.5% compared to November and 17.3% above the December 2019 rate. Privately owned housing continued to increase in December, rising by 5.8% from the previous month and by 5.2% compared to December 2019. The uptrend started in September 2020.

China will continue to play an important role in the copper market. The country accounts for about half of global primary consumption, which is then used to manufacture export goods.

According to the aforementioned Reuters report, appliances output also increased in China. Similarly, China‚Äôs refrigerators exports went up by 45% in December 2020 compared to December 2019. During the same period, exports of microwave ovens rose by 35%.

Indonesian copper smelter

Indonesian politician Luhut Pandjaitan, said Freeport-McMoRan, $FCX and Tsingshan Holding Group reached a $2.8 billion deal to build a copper smelter in Indonesia‚Äôs Weda Bay. The smelter would process copper concentrate from the Grasberg mine. Luhut did not report a timeline, per the report.

‚ÄúThe smelter will produce copper pipes and wires of which output can be worth $10 billion or more,‚Äù the minister reportedly told IDX Channel. The smelter will aim to produce copper products to be used in lithium battery components. Indonesia is working to build an electric vehicle supply chain, as it is also a major nickel producer.  
**A reminder:** I am not a personal financial advisor, please do your own research. I‚Äôm only a value investor and I like to find value where others shy away from and commodities are the red-headed step child that I believe will shine in 2021 for all the reasons I have laid out here."

04/03/2021,stocks,"$TRQ
Imho don't overlook the copper mining company with very low p/e. 
TRQ is 66% owner of the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine in southern Mongolia.

With current copper price and even potential further increase, I think this will not be needed and current stock price is therefore undervalued."

04/03/2021,stocks,Yea. People keep bringing up how they bought stocks in 2020 and brag about gains. But all of these topics are about the present. What someone did a year ago wont help people trying to buy stocks and make money now.
04/03/2021,stocks,the next 30-50% will be much harder.
04/03/2021,stocks,"True,  but that's still a more than solid return. The only part that makes me a little nervous is currency conversion.   I've owned AFL for a bunch of years and every earning report has some gain or loss in EPS due to yen to dollar conversion.

2021-04-03 18:56:29,stocks,"Does anyone buy stocks for the power it has in a company? (Even though it is an insanely small amount of power?) I really don't know much about stocks, but from what I heard, if you own a bunch of stocks in a company, you own a portion of it. Does anyone buy stocks to support a company rather than just make money off it? I want to buy some stocks, but the first couple I want to buy are for the companies that mean the most to me."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Well for cruises some of them offer a small amount of on-board credit if you're a shareholder (usually with like a 100 share minimum). Pretty nice little perk. But other than that? No, because even if I like a company, I like a lot of things, but I'm not going to risk my future (or even a small portion of it) just because I like the company.

04/03/2021,stocks,"You can buy 1 single share and you technically ‚Äúown‚Äù a part of the company - that‚Äôs what a public company trading on the stock market is all about.

In order to have legit influence, you would have to invest many millions into a company. Like many many lol.

The most influence we as regular people have are proxy votes. At least, that‚Äôs what I can do with the companies that I hold.

It‚Äôs sort of fun to think that you technically own a portion of a big company, but it‚Äôs meaningless in the end."
04/03/2021,stocks,You own a portion of a company if you own any shares at all. This makes no difference in nearly all cases since most retail investors own too few to have any influence on the company.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yeah, Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman, T. Boone Pickens....."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Careful investing with heart, it could lead to bad decisions and cloud judgement. Buying stocks doesn‚Äôt really help the company unless your buying millions anyways. But it could add blind optimism and confirmation bias."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Theoretically you could buy all the stock on the open market and assume ownership of the entire company.  Many companies have preferred shares or other structures set up to prevent this, but some don‚Äôt.  This is called a hostile takeover, and usually requires deep pockets and crafty maneuvering as well as a deep understanding of how the specific company is set up with its stock.  Often you‚Äôll have a majority shareholder that retains control of the company and wouldn‚Äôt ever sell to you, which makes it unlikely to have a successful takeover.   Realistically if you can get to 10% or more ownership interest you‚Äôll start to have a bit of sway over the direction of the company, and possibly even get into a board seat if you‚Äôre otherwise qualified."

04/03/2021,stocks,"Let‚Äôs say I own a share of Apple, and I sell it to you. How did that help the company? You didn‚Äôt give them your money, you gave the money to me. 

Buying a stock is really only helping the company if you buy at IPO or some secondary offering. Otherwise, you‚Äôre not giving money to the company, you‚Äôre giving it to some other investor who decided to sell."
04/03/2021,stocks,"To buy a company, you need to acquire a private share of the company, and most share you see from a brokerage are public. Public common stocks are for revenue only.

04/03/2021,stocks,No
04/03/2021,stocks,Ok so the overwhelming opinion is that people don't do that. Aren't stocks ownership of a company though? What about people who want to invest to see a company succeed? Do people only invest in companies because they want to benefit themselves? That's kinds depressing imo
04/03/2021,stocks,"Nothing wrong with investing in a company you like , believe in, and want to support. You just have to also couple that with making sure they are a strong, well led company with growth potential or a leader in their industry.

04/03/2021,stocks,"yeah i don't know why everyone is giving you a hard time. I bought 1 share of google back in 2008 and it has since split into two different shares. a voting share and a non voting share.

04/03/2021,stocks,"When you buy a stock, you are buying it from a previous owner, not the company. For example I sell, you buy, my shares go to you. The company gets no benefit from someone buying their stock after they issue the IPO or secondary offering, which most people don‚Äôt have access to."

That said, you have to distance yourself from the stock once you see signs that the company may not be heading in the right direction. Don't hold the stock just because you're a fan of the company, but because your knowledge of the company leads you to believe it is a profitable investment."

04/03/2021,stocks,Yes but with hundreds of millions of shares outstanding your 10 shares are meaningless. People invest because they think the company will grow and be worth more and their investment (handing the company money in exchange for small ownership stake) will be more valuable
04/03/2021,stocks,"Owning shares does not help company by itself. Every share is owned by some one, and there's no magic in any particular person owning them. If you have vision how to make the company more successful, go and work for them. If you succeed, you'll benefit yourself too."

2021-04-03 18:45:04,stocks,"Please provide bear case for BB I am about to invest my savings. So my portfolio consists mainly of ETFs, NVDA, NIO, ON Semiconducros and some other smaller holdings. My biggest holding is actually NIO because I really believe in this company and they prove themselves every quarter however there is fear of delisting, possible EV bubble and so on therefore someone might think about it as a risky investment. 

What I actually see in BB right now is kind of similar but without external risks. With BB and their focus on cyber security, EVs and IVY platform I dont really think they can go in a wrong direction. Of course there is always risk of not meeting goals for revenue etc. but possibility of where it can be in a year or two is superb. 

Anyway, I recently got hold of quite a big sum of money and I would like to diversify more and BB seems like the best choice. Maybe there are some hidden risks I have not found yet, I would be very thankful if someone can share their opinion. 

Thanks a lot !

- BB is unprofitable, losing a lot of money. 

- Insiders at the company are selling like crazy.  this is usually a bad sign, showing company executives think the stock is overvalued or they lack confidence in the company. https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/BB/summary

- Fidelity gives it poor ratings on 4 critical traits (valuation, earnings quality, growth stability and overall financial health). I can't link to this, you need a Fidelity account to see the data.

BB stock has basically been stagnant for a decade and managed to do nothing but get worse in last year's incredible bull run on tech. It only flashed to life in January when the partnership with amazon surfaced and then it got caught up in the meme boom and became very overvalued. Even their executives are selling off because they have been bag holding for years. 

Even though they seemingly have good news all the time, they aren't making any money or seem to be providing a product or service that leads the industry.

Take Apple, for instance. Darling tech, but 5-10 years from now they'll be where they were back in the 90's. That's because their core values haven't changed: squeeze every dime from the customers and treat them like garbage. Great product, brilliant marketing, terrible company. I already hear my students talk about why Android is so much better. No one likes getting nickel-and-dimed, no one likes being locked into an endless upgrade cycle, and the idea that they care about the customers' privacy is laughable‚Äîthey only started giving a shit when it was good PR.

2021-04-03 17:37:57,stocks,"Why you should invest in Index only As a disclaimer, this is purely my opinion and i am not a financial advisor. But i strongly believe the majority of us should simply dump all of their cash into VTI or VOO and do nothing else. Here is why:


* I strongly believe that 99% of us cannot time the market. If you do anything else that invest for 10+ years, you are competing against bots and teams of pros, and will likely lose money. Might be lucky in the short term, but eventually you will get burned.


* Secondly, assuming that you invest for the long term, if you look over a very long time frame, the % of companies that actually would be a good investment over a 30 years period is very small. Do the test and check random companies, created 40 years ago, most of them would have been terrible investments, or even went bankrupt. The long term profits of the stock market is actually created by a small % of companies, and guessing which ones will be successful is often more luck than skills.


* Indexing is also way less stressful than anything else. If there is a crash, you can be confident VTI will recover, and you can very safely DCA into it with more cash. VTI is not going bankrupt. We can't say the same about random stock tickers. Even giants fall sometimes. Its also far less time consuming. No research to do, no news to check, just DCA into it whenever you can.



* The profits you can make using this strategy is deceptively high. With my 50K salary and a frugal life style, and abusing RRSP, i am able to save around 25K a year. If you use an investment calculator, starting with 0$, and putting 2K a month in VTI, assuming 10% profits a year, after 15 years, you will have 830K!

* Please note that i don't think that its terrible to allow a small % of the portfolio to more speculative plays. I myself have some ARKG shares. But you have to keep these as a small % of the portfolio, and avoid too aggressively DCA into it. If it falls, it falls. But keep in mind even thought these plays are beating the SP500 during a bull run, they could be in a lot of pain during the next crash. Heck, in February a small correction had a lot of them down 30%."

04/03/2021,stocks,"Investing in an index has nothing to do with timing the market. If anyone can time the market, the last thing you‚Äôd want to do is to time on when to invest into an index (why would you want to time the bottom of the average when you can time the bottom of something that can yield multiple times the average). 

Investing in an index is for diversification/ protecting wealth and for people who don‚Äôt want to learn and the stress of holding individual stocks. 

If you‚Äôre investing in individual stocks, you aren‚Äôt directly ‚Äúcompeting‚Äù against pros. Realistically speaking, when you invest in individual stocks, you want to be outperforming/ beating the average, otherwise you‚Äôd be better off just investing in the average (index). 

Personally speaking, investing and researching stocks is a hobby of mine. I love being about to do the research, analysis and calculating projections and giving price targets to make buy and sell decisions. Sure I can use a paper account, but the feeling of being ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù is just not there when you use fake money. You have no sense of what‚Äôs to lose so you can just recklessly and blindly buy whatever you want and just say how smart you are because out of the 1000 stocks you bought, 1 of them yielded a x1000 return.

04/03/2021,stocks,"I agree that most people should have most of their money in low-fee index funds. fees matter, and it's simply safer and easier to buy a cross-section of the market for the core of your portfolio. 

however, a few quibbles: 

- people can try to time the market with index funds. happens all the time. the DALBAR studies consistently find many people underperform the averages because they move money within their 401k at the wrong time. stocks drop, and they panic and transfer it all to a money market account ...when they should stay the course or even add more to the 401k. 

- another market timing strategy with index funds or trend chasing within their 401ks, which tends to backfire: they'll move money to hot funds/strategies, like growth stocks in the last few years, even though return-chasing is counterproductive. very few people have the stomach or knowledge to lean towards underperforming assets, though the data is very strong that this strategy is more productive (Morningstar has analyzed this for years: investing in the asset classes that have seen the most outflows any particular year will tend to beat investing in the classes that see the most inflows. this was also basically Sir John Templeton's strategy for decades). 

- VTI is certainly not a bad option. but you can outperform it with a simple 50/50 split of S&P 500/extended market index. small and mid cap will outperform large cap over time, but a total market fund has only 15% mid and 5% small cap allocation. very low fees, total market coverage, but the 50/50 split will beat the total market index by a substantial margin. an even 3-way split of large cap index, mid cap index and small cap index will beat the 50/50 split. https://imgur.com/a/Nq5dENx

- you mention DCA several times, but regular paycheck investing is not DCA. DCA is: if you have $X dollars to invest and decide to break it into smaller deposits over time to take advantage of volatility or mitigate risk. research shows lump-sum investing tends to be more effective than DCA. https://www.pwlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Dollar-Cost-Averaging-vs-Lump-Sum-Investing.pdf

- there is ample evidence showing certain strategies can tend to beat the market. year in and out? not always. over long stretches of time? yes.  Joel Greenblatt's ""magic investing formula"" has been validated by academic research from around the world (selecting stocks with lower than average p/e but higher than average return on capital https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_formula_investing). active share, or a fund's deviation from a benchmark, is also associated with outperformance (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=891719). a wealth of research shows value investing tends to outperform (https://tweedy.com/resources/library_docs/papers/WhatHasWorkedFundOct14Web.pdf). there's also data showing active management can be more effective with small cap and international stocks (particularly emerging markets) where markets are less efficient (https://www.morningstar.com/articles/651551/passive-vs-active-debating-international-small-caps)

04/03/2021,stocks,">Secondly, assuming that you invest for the long term, if you look over a  very long time frame, the % of companies that actually would be a good  investment over a 30 years period is very small. Do the test and check  random companies, created 40 years ago, most of them would have been  terrible investments, or even went bankrupt. The long term profits of  the stock market is actually created by a small % of companies, and  guessing which ones will be successful is often more luck than skills.

I disagree with this part. Picking individual stocks should be more profitable, if done correctly.

Picking random companies won't necessarily be as profitable as sticking with an index, but you don't need to pick random companies. Statistics like ""most people don't beat the market"" don't tend to separate the data by attempted strategy. Buffett and Lynch both insist people can beat the market if they pick intelligently.

My point is that no matter how much research you do, its deceptively difficult to truly guess which stocks will be winners over the very long term (20+ years).

Also, you are competing against pros. You‚Äôre competing against everyone else, frankly. For each transaction there‚Äôs going to be someone who won and someone who lost, if you think about it. Not to mention we believe prices move over a longer time frame because fundamentals matter - I believe that, too. I love the research aspect which is why I have some core individual holdings too. But we truthfully have no idea why stocks move up and down, we only make theories to construct frameworks and inject logic into something that isn‚Äôt really all that logical.

What‚Äôs more important is to be realistic with your goals and your planning. If you‚Äôre in a stock on the sole premise that everyone else is in it (eg. GME, AMC, other meme stocks), then you‚Äôre better off being with the index. 

Like I said in the previous post: investing in an index is to preserve/ protect wealth and allow investors to participate in average market returns without the need to know a lot of about investing (for the ignorant - Which is NOT a bad thing FTR).

That means at some points you‚Äôll be buying into the US market at ATH when stocks may dip or stay flat for a while. When US equities stagnate, that also tends to be the time when European equities and em do better. In the end it rounds out and may give you higher returns or less volatility.

> ‚ÄúApproximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,‚Äù noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
*****
> Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.
*****
> ‚ÄúIn each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,‚Äù he wrote in a note.
*****
> He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.
*****
> ‚ÄúOur work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2¬Ω‚Äì3% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,‚Äù Golub wrote.
*****
> # April is far from cruelest month
Aside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.
*****
> Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange‚Äôs Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that‚Äôs constructive for stocks.
*****
> The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&P 500, trading on the CBOE.
*****
> Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.
*****
> Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,‚Äù he wrote in a note.
*****
> Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.
*****
> ‚ÄúApril is usually good. It‚Äôs the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It‚Äôs up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.
*****
> The market enters the ‚Äúsell in May‚Äù period during the second quarter. The market adage, ‚Äúsell in May and go away,‚Äù is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.
*****
> ‚ÄúIn that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,‚Äù Stovall said. ‚ÄúTech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.‚Äù
*****
> # Fed ahead
> The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed‚Äôs 2% target.
*****
> The producer price index ‚Äî which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output ‚Äî will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.
*****
> As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC‚Äôs Sara Eisen.
*****
> Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.
*****
> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.

> # Stocks Love April

> ‚ÄúHistory doesn‚Äôt repeat itself, but it often rhymes.‚Äù Mark Twain

> What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Just how strong has April been lately? ‚ÄúI had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúOther than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.‚Äù

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:

> * Since 1950 it is the second best month
> * The past 20 years it is the best month
> * The past 10 years it is the second best month
> * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Taking it a step further, here‚Äôs what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.

> # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After

> Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.

> # A Humble Victory Lap

> It has been a little over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It‚Äôs also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.

> It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie‚Äîa lesson we always keep in mind.

> ‚ÄúFew on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,‚Äù added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúEven though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a ‚Äòwhat have you done for me lately‚Äô industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.‚Äù

> Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.

*****

> # Turn Off, Tune Out

> The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.

> Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.

> Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**

> In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**

> At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.

> # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?

> As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.

> As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**

> That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**

> As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.

> # Stocks and Inflation

> As we continue LPL Research‚Äôs Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow‚Äôs blog, where we‚Äôll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.

> Looking at S&P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that‚Äôs under control is a tailwind for stocks,‚Äù explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúIt is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.‚Äù

> Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

> The inflation question is one that isn‚Äôt going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn‚Äôt a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks."
04/03/2021,stocks,The last days have been treating me quite well actually. Hopefully we can continue on a positive note. Thanks for the post once again.
04/03/2021,stocks,The amount of work people put in for this stuff for literally no reward (i dont consider internet clout a reward) is insane. Financial institutions pay millions for data in one way or another and then theres people on reddit doing stuff like this for free (i know its probably not near the quality that they pay for but got dayum this sort of stuff is solid)
04/03/2021,stocks,Your telling me reds not the only colour?
04/03/2021,stocks,You get a green! And you get a green!
04/03/2021,stocks,Great write up - can I get the cliffs notes?
04/03/2021,stocks,Sounds like a Thursday dip if JPow is going to open his mouth.
04/03/2021,stocks,What boggles my mind is the amount of money people have invested in GME. I was just scrolling wsb and the first ten posts are over 6 mil yolos. What‚Äôs even more annnoying is that ytd gme is up 900% and AAPL is down 10. Nothing makes sense anymore.
04/03/2021,stocks,"> Blowout jobs report

My brain read something else‚Ä¶ I need to get out more‚Ä¶"
04/03/2021,stocks,Holly fuck that was a long post.
04/03/2021,stocks,I want to add NVDA and maybe ADBE to my portfolio. Good moves right now?
04/03/2021,stocks,"JPow talking again next week on Thursday, oh boy"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Outstanding, thank you for the information."
04/03/2021,stocks,"All these positive indicators for Tesla, the economy, several other stocks made me want to buy premarket, but I‚Äôve learned not to get burned with that haha"

Monday needs to be pullback or bubble will be too big."
04/03/2021,stocks,remindme! 29 days
04/03/2021,stocks,"I see a dip on Tech for Monday and value stocks are in play for a day or two. But since it‚Äôs earnings season; I do see tech bouncing up a little higher until the first few earnings days come out. If the earnings blow things out of the water, then we see all tech earnings good. If not, then it‚Äôs a rocky month, but still positive overall. Monday will be red for tech, but positive overall for the week."
04/03/2021,stocks,TL;DR
04/03/2021,stocks,"From a technical view the VIX just filled a gap from  March 2020 and is poised to rip this week or next. QQQ hitting resistance and looking for a reversal from last few days. With jobs report from Friday id be positioned in reopening trade this week, long volatility and short the Qs using SQQQ."
04/03/2021,stocks,The last few days have only brought me back closer to whole. Need a bunch more to make it up but I‚Äôll take whatever I can get.
04/03/2021,stocks,"This was once true on the internet, but today this information is not as free as it seems.  The big money behind ‚Äúengagement‚Äù is seeping out to all corners of the internet and information that seems free is often times used to drive you toward influencers or websites who are getting paid huge dollar figures to stream, bait clicks, and advertise certain products or propoaganda.

Not saying this is true with this post, but it is important to read social media with a skeptical eye.  Reddit has gotten incredibly manipulated."
04/03/2021,stocks,"It sounds like I've finally sacrificed enough goats.

It's nice to see some green in my portfolio again."
04/03/2021,stocks,"One thing that annoys me is the VIX is simply throwing the number of calls and puts into an equation. From what I can tell, let's say big money is buying a massive amount of calls which are FAR out of the money for pennies... this would drive the VIX down into oblivion.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESPX/options?straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESPX/options?straddle=true)

Ultimately the VIX can NOT be used as a market indicator since it can so easily be bastardized.

Other than that, can't wait to see how the market digest the peter pan new jobs numbers on Monday."
04/03/2021,stocks,What have y‚Äôall been buying? SP500 hit an all time high on Friday
04/03/2021,stocks,"Last week: green. 

Next week: probably green, but maybe red."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Man my notes are a bumpy start for the week maybe new highs but some dips leading to a fat dip thurs into fri jpow speech also having this effect. I‚Äôm loading sqqq come 12 maybe some vix plays?

Historically April starts to smooth out marches dips and second half of April is big green."
04/03/2021,stocks,Small dip leading to Thursday then we flying rest of April as usual
04/03/2021,stocks,A day for buying then!
04/03/2021,stocks,This will reverse soon enough. IMAO there is a reason why value stocks are catching up now.
04/03/2021,stocks,Came here to see who else went there. lol
04/03/2021,stocks,"OMG. The post is so long that my damn scrollbar is hidden way down below my taskbar. ü§£ No offense, OP. Just pointing that out. üòä"
04/03/2021,stocks,that just means you'll end up getting FOMO
04/03/2021,stocks,Too soon to burst. I want to be breakeven first on a few more stocks so I can set stop losses
04/03/2021,stocks,"This. If it keeps ramping up with so many all time highs I‚Äôll be nervous, Thursday will level some shit."

04/03/2021,stocks,"There's a strong divergence between $SMH and $QQQ. 
$SMH is much stronger than $QQQ and megacaps are mostly stalling if you check $NYFANG.

>let's say big money is buying a massive amount of calls which are FAR out of the money for pennies... this would drive the VIX down into oblivion.

The opposite.

The VIX is a sort of average of the spread between call and put options on s&p e-mini futures.

Someone jamming the far-otm calls would be indicating an expectation of high volatility, and that would show up as increased VIX."

Tech is good, but the NfP report doesn‚Äôt effect tech as much as non-tech space. The only hype tech will get as of now is from earnings coming out, but nothing fundamentally should be boosting any further investment in tech. Rising dollar value also means people will put less money into the stock market. Just my two cents for Monday."

2021-04-03 16:04:49,stocks,"Most reliable method to calculate intrinsic value? First of all, please excuse my English, as it isn't my first language.

 As you can see in the picture, I have tried to do my own analysis of Apple (Yeah I know it is mainstream, but it was mostly to get the method right).

I have   tried to calculate the intrinsic value based on the EPS TTM and the Free cash flow, and as you can see, I get two different results (as I   expected I would, although the factors are the same). The stats are   taken from Yahoo finance and MSN money, and I know both methods contain   quite a lot of ""guesstimates"".

My question is therefore, what method do you find to be most reliable?

Link to my analysis below

[https://imgur.com/a/RCvUDwI](https://imgur.com/a/RCvUDwI)"
04/03/2021,stocks,"I want to point out that your free cash flow estimate for 2018 is approximately in the ballpark of what AAPL actually traded at. 

You plugged in a 35% margin of safety. You guesstimated some future cash flows. If I plug in a slightly different margin of safety and different future cash flows, I will end up with a different valuation.

The current stock price is the last price at which 

(1) Somebody in the market thought it was worth buying at that price, and had money to do so.

(2) Somebody in the market was willing to sell at that price and they had the shares to do so.

That trade occurred because (1) and (2) had a different valuation to begin with.

In other words, if AAPL held the exact same value for everyone all the time, nobody would be buying and selling once some equilibrium is reached.

The other side to the valuation is how much you can extract from owning a share. Assume a company X provides $4 dividend this year and the lowest return rate you will accept is 4%. So then, the most you would pay for it is $100. Now if there is another company who wants to acquire X, they will look at future cash flows and determine what price to pay for the company. Because they can extract value from future cash flows, they will use the future cash flow model and come up with a price > 100$. For example, say they price it at $150.

So, you can extract value only up to $100 per share, but if you believe someone else can extract value at $150 per share - you might be able to buy a share at any price below $150 and sell it to whoever can extract value at $150 and make some profit along the way.

In other words, it‚Äôs not enough to just pick a model for valuing your company. You should think about how much you can extract from it, either through dividends or by guessing what price you will be able to sell it at (even better if you can guess why someone will buy it from you at that price in the future).

PS: I‚Äôm a random internet pervert. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and literally have no clue what i‚Äôm talking about."
04/03/2021,stocks,"There isn‚Äôt a most reliable method for every company in every industry. 

Cash flow valuations won‚Äôt work in non cash flowing businesses (valuing start ups, or companies that have yet to be cash flow even though they have good growth prospects). 

PE valuations can only value a company with earnings and values it at what the current market values the company earnings. Again this sort of misses current unprofitable growth companies. 

I usually have some sort of valuation methods that Cash Flows > Income > Sales > TAM. The lower you go the less accurate you‚Äôll be and the closer to a start up the company you‚Äôre looking at will be."
04/03/2021,stocks,"You should use a DCF. Aswath Damodaran has a course on it here: [https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=aswath+damodaran](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=aswath+damodaran)  


You can also see [this tool](https://tracktak.com) which automates a lot of the above."
04/03/2021,stocks,"no matter which method you use, there is always a possibility of error. there are disagreements among experienced professional investors about how to value a stock. they can even offer a range (""fair value is probably somewhere between $90 and $100""), or relative valuation (""Company X is trading at closer to fair value than competitor Company Y, which is overvalued."")

this is why the ""margin of safety"" concept is important. ideally, you want to buy a stock price that's much lower than any estimate of value. if the price is 5% under intrinsic estimate, there's more risk than buying if the price is 30-50% under intrinsic value."

04/03/2021,stocks,"The most reliable? That would be the dividends growth model, but that only works for mature companies and it's not without its flaws."
04/03/2021,stocks,"I like the way you think, I know you should never base your investing solely on an analysis like above, but should consider other factors as well. Especially considering the way the stock market has behaved the last couple of months, where you would have lost A LOT of profit, if you weren't willing to buy a stock, as most of the stocks have been overpriced according to an analysis like mine. 

&#x200B;

But when that being said, is it correctly assumed that you are somewhat insinuating that you should consider other factors above an analysis of cash flow etc.? I apologise if i misunderstood."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Very relevant input, I hadn't originally thought about the start up issues, but I quickly realised that these methods mostly work for well established companies."
04/03/2021,stocks,Will definitely look into that!
04/03/2021,stocks,"I know that this gives a cleaner formula, but to my knowledge the more simple formula is the one most experts use, correct? As it allows for faster analysis and generally gives a somewhat similar output?"

04/03/2021,stocks,"I suppose you won't find a model/ method without flaws, as you are never able to fully predict the future. I'm just looking for a method with the highest possibility of being right."

2021-04-03 15:18:51,stocks,"Is Plug dead? Seems like the company has ambitious goals for the future by 2024 which is why I bought. But I bought high at $60 and as most of you know it‚Äôs been slowly bleeding off over the course of this past month.

If you already have, say, 50 shares then you'd only need to spend $1500 to get to 100, and I feel pretty comfortable owning Plug at the current price. I don't see it dropping below 20. Yes they have problems but they are way ahead of anyone else in terms of fuel cell production.

Fuel cells have been used by NASA since the 60's, not new technology.  For widespread usage, H2 is just too volatile; remember the Hindenburg blimp.  Also, they loose so much efficiency in cold weather. The newer H2 gels are promising from a safety perspective.   Frankly, with the newer battery tech, I just don't think fuel cells will gain mass utilization. They will always have a niche use."

Now Fisker is competing against well established companies with better capital and with strong desires to take over the EV field. Tesla is established now and we‚Äôll established companies like Volkswagen, Honda and Toyota are getting serious about EVs. Especially Volkswagen.
I would take Fisker shares as a risky bet. They would have to overcome some heavy competition, and a huge amount of money to become competitive."

The chance any of these small EV companies have of enduring as legit companies is extremely small.

04/03/2021,stocks,"EV companies are scams.

2 reasons- the dealership model in the US in particular is set up to keep out competition, which is why Tesla was the only real successful company and it was a combination of their marketing, technology and basically selling them online to get around the dealership model.

Not just anyone can do that.

Secondly, the rare earth materials required for the permanent magnet motors and the batteries are ... rare, as the name implies. As of a couple of years ago, Jaguar and a couple other high end companies abandoned plans for EVs because they can‚Äôt get the materials.

04/03/2021,stocks,"Rapidly improving economy ‚Äî> Inflation ‚Äî> higher interest rates. 

Since all companies are valued based on expectations of future cash flow, when interest rates go up, discount rates should go up. This means company valuations go down in for two reasons when looking at discounting cash flows. 

1) Future cash flows go down because of higher expected interest expense
2) Discount rates rise, making present value of future cash flows lower

Companies that promise cash flow in the future but are unprofitable now get hit hardest."

1. How was the 2000 tech and 2008 housing crash like? Was it a quick drop then leveled out before a recovery or was it a painful and slooow drop every day type of crash until 50% decrease before a recovery? For instance, I think 2020 crash was like a quick 2 month 35-40 percent drop then recovery.

2. How scary was it in comparison to the 2020 crash cuz that sht was nerve wrecking especially for a first time investor haha."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Just take a look at QCOM chart from 1998 - 2001.   It rose like crazy - I thought I was a f-ing genius.  After Y2K, we had 10-15% drop - I thought free money and rushed to buy more on the dip - I am a genius it went back up a little; then by mid June, lost $300K and exited.   Hindsight is 20/20 but if I held on until it would be a good investment, but I could not handle the lost.

I knew people that lost more than 7 figures with CMGI - everyone is a genius during boom.

**Everyone during a boom will tell you that this time is different (new economic, interest rate, stimulus, ---) - do not believe the BS they are self-justifying things to make themselves think they are smarter than the market.**

I learned one thing - **slow and steady wins the race**.   First, full fund retirement accounts with low cost mutual funds or ETF,  secondly pick-up a 2-3 blue chips stocks and consistently re-invest dividends; then and only then - start a speculative portfolio to keep you mind active and involved ""i*n the game*"" - and ***NEVER touch the retirement or blue chips and NEVER invest in speculative stocks in your retirement account***.

Good Luck"
04/03/2021,stocks,"I was too young for 2000, but had money invested for the 2008 crash.  If it had crashed in a month and started recovering after, the way it did in 2020, would have been a walk in the park. 

The 2020 crash felt like this: everyday the market drops.  Day after day after day for months on end.  Some stocks will go up for a few days and people would chase them only to watch them crash all over. You invest money in when you get paid, and by the end of the day, your portfolio dropped more in value than the money you added to your account.  I never sold and considered it a test of discipline, but those were some lousy lousy days to be watching the market.  The ‚Äústonks go up‚Äù crowd have never seen a real bear market imo - 2020 bear was too short to be a real test.  It isn‚Äôt how deep it dives that gets to you, it‚Äôs the slow slow bleed of watching your net worth slowly evaporate.  That‚Äôs when you start questioning everything you‚Äôve learned, when you start questioning if investing is even the right thing to do, or if capitalism even works.  Mastering the head games the market plays with you is the true test"
04/03/2021,stocks,"The dot com bubble was way different since there were so many shit companies. 

The 08 crash was obviously due to the housing market/banks. The prices were so low, the question was really whether or not the company would go bankrupt. During this time I spread my money out, and very thin. 

2020 crash? I'm going to assume you mean when COVID hit. Most stocks have recovered or hit ATH since this time. 

I would argue any crashes are going to be a lot shorter and have a speedier recovery due to tech improving. Back then trading in and out was more ass too, because of fees.

This is my opinion too, but older traders and newer traders don't really see eye to eye as much. I think newer traders want a quick buck, and have way more FOMO because of how easy it is to spread information. Due to the ease of trading, I would argue too that higher p/e should be considered since more people are in the market. I have some holdings that I believe are way overvalued, but I bought them anyways because I don't think I'll get the opportunity to again. 

Being long and believing in the company is how true wealth is built. Everyone likes to zoom out on a chart and be like damn, I missed this stock at this price. The truth is, those people never believed in it in the first place and wouldn't have held through all that time. I also remind myself when a stock dips. It wasn't on my radar before, I'm not gonna get it on the way down."
04/03/2021,stocks,"The 2000 and 2008 crashes were much worse in that they weren't caused by any external factors, just a very unhealthy level of speculation and lots of fraud.

They took much, much longer to have prices recover and both had companies fail that seemed extremely solid going into them.

You could buy stock in just about any company that wasn't obviously going to go bankrupt between about mid-March and mid-August of last year and have doubled your money by now. You could also have done the same on several companies that seemed like they obviously were going to."
04/03/2021,stocks,"The reason of that quick recovery last year is because central bans started pumping printed money in the system. Our economy is on a drip. 

Imo the bill will come later with high inflation."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Any chart will show it better than it can be explained.  On the way down, 2020 was remarkable for the unrelenting selling.  The sky was falling.  Then came the rebound and it‚Äôs even more remarkable.  It‚Äôs been like a decade crammed into a year.  That‚Äôs not natural.  But that also wasn‚Äôt the burst of any real bubble.  We were in a credit bubble.  It‚Äôs essentially worse now.  It will burst some time."

04/03/2021,stocks,"The crashes in 2000 and 2008 recovered more slowly (naturally) because the fed wasn't as aggressive in preventing them. In 2020 they cranked the money printer at full speed and propped the economy at the risk of future inflation. As a result the 2020 crash recovered very quickly and looks more like a small dip when you zoom out. Had they let it really crash, it would have been way down. Not as low as 2008 but certainly low. As soon as inflation creeps up though, they'll have to bring the rates back. Hopefully that doesn't happen too soon for the state of the economy or the crash we averted might just have been delayed."

04/03/2021,stocks,"I guess it wouldn‚Äôt be complete without saying what I do to not let my emotions get the better of me. I have an asset allocation spreadsheet that I follow and an investment plan of where to put money. I keep cash handy for emergencies or buying opportunities (about 6 months income worth).  I try to keep it as mechanical as possible - oh, this has dropped to x% of my portfolio, and it needs to be at 10%. I‚Äôll buy some of that.  Or - my speculative portion of my portfolio has dropped quite a bit, let‚Äôs bring that percentage back up to the prior allocation.

04/03/2021,stocks,"I can‚Äôt agree more with this statement, with but one exception.  I think FOMO was a big part of the 2000 crash.  People were stupidly investing in every .com just so they wouldn‚Äôt miss out on new and exciting companies that utilize this new thing called ‚Äúthe internet‚Äù.  FOMO is just way more exacerbated now.  You are right though.  Being long and diversification is what will build wealth."
04/03/2021,stocks,Future crashes will have fast recovery not because of tech but the FED. 2008 proved you can swap money for assets from a distress bank or company while you partially own the company. Nothing was actually created or destroyed. A swap took place. If they need a loan then congress approves a bailout with stipulations that you have to pay the money back with interest. The bailout money from 2008 was fully repaid in 2013 with a net profit of 110 billion. Propublica has a tracker for this and it still on going.
04/03/2021,stocks,"The '08 Crash was being warned about as far back as 2002. There were OBVIOUS problems in the system that were not only being played down, but anyone trying to point them out was attacked by financial media, and many called racist.

Greedy banks get the blame, and they deserve some of it, but the real issues at the heart of it were caused by Government.  (See ""Redlining"" and the University of Chicago)"
04/03/2021,stocks,I agree completely with this except for one thing. I don‚Äôt think our economy will always be up for a speedy recovery like 2020. Taping the money printer on has consequences down the line. And I think we are going to have a financial correction at least very soon and I think it‚Äôll last a long time. The fed can‚Äôt print any more money or lower interest rates any more than they have so there are no options when the next recession/crash happens. I think this might happen soon because of all the normie investors and meme stocks that are creating bubbles all over the market even on good stocks. I really hope I‚Äôm wrong.
04/03/2021,stocks,Well written. Thanks for sharing. How do you be long and believe in companies?
04/03/2021,stocks,Why did it take longer to recover?
04/03/2021,stocks,"The inflation you‚Äôre seeing isnt because we flooded the market with cash by lowering interest rates. You‚Äôre seeing inflation because the pandemic upended supply chains and shifted demand from services to physical products. The supply chain has a hard time catching up to minor blips, let alone the massive shift in demand that happened in the wake of the pandemic.

Just take for example pork belly. Last year, pork belly prices collapsed because restaurants normally buy up the lion‚Äôs share of pork belly and chefs prepare it for customers. With restaurants closed, home chefs were not going to be able to cook all those pork bellies because they really didn‚Äôt know what to do with them.

Inflation only happens when more dollars chase fewer goods. You can flood a market with cash and so long as you increase overall demand and supply in tandem, inflation is not a problem. 

As the economy opens up, and as supply chains adjust, inflation will take care of itself."
04/03/2021,stocks,"I dont think high inflation rate is something to worry about, it won't be anything close to used to be 10%+.

Without inflation when pumping money will be the biggest problem like what happened in Japan. When you see no inflation it is when things go wrong, not when inflation actually happens.

Assets price going to go up for next few years tho, those bills going to push construction cost even higher, good luck if you dont have a property."

When the restrictions on Home repo's and Evictions are finally ended, there is going to be a crash of both home prices, rents, and related securities in most areas of the country.

But I also believe that a falling dollar  has an impact on rising inflation. Simular like what happend in Turkey.

So excited to NOT own any property!  Without being able to write off mortgage interest any more (Thanks, Trump, ya criminal pedo), there is no incentive to be in American residential real estate.

This article from Barron's on $FB is a good example of how tech stocks are being overlooked.  

Source:  https://www.barrons.com/articles/facebook-stock-is-cheap-heres-how-it-could-gain-20-or-more-51617399483"
04/03/2021,stocks,"FB is pretty undervalued. However, I think that it is warranted. The issue with all social media sites is that they become a way to push product or revenue for users. FB feels like a giant ad now. Similarly, Tiktok is an absolute shit show now because creators can be monetized now and people have gotten famous/rich off of it. They push crypto and meme stocks, too. 

I use FB, but I don't use my wall, interact with any pages, or like people's comments. I use Messenger over SMS. I also barely use IG. I just never can bring myself to reposition myself with FB. VR, AR, decent earnings and revenue. However, the ongoing issue with freedom of speech and fake news is really causing a huge chunk of people to leave FB as well."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Fb to me falls into the momentum stock category. Which works both for and against. Because of the political/social climate we live in, stocks like this are affected by way more than just business fundamentals and numbers. I dont touch fb because its in a situation where earnings dont matter if ‚Äòcancel culture‚Äô targets them next. This is 2021, the game has changed. Now we have bulls, bears, and apes. Fb makes sense on paper, but i just cant bring myself to buy because there are too many extenuating circumstances that can affect it on any given day. I try to stay away from stocks that national sentiment can affect in such a big way. And i think i‚Äôm not alone with that approach, add to that the growing distrust and dislike of it, to me, means we wont see any big rises any time soon if ever. Regardless of if it makes sense or not. To quote joe rogan ‚Äòwere livin in some strange times‚Äô.. wasnt that long ago that earnings, debt, amount of outstanding shares, direction of companies, etc.. were the strategies.. nowadays with stocks like these, we need to check redit, ig, twitter, etc.. to see if its a viable investment.

The difference here is they aren't actively trading every single day like they do with the other funds. 

Yes this is a fast moving industry but it's not fast enough that they would need to rebalance every single day. No industry moves that fast.

Holdings would change as companies come into and exit the 3D printing industry. In the latter case, this would be because a company went under, changed their focus, etc. You can check the prospectus to understand when and on what terms these changes are made.

2021-04-03 05:55:27,stocks,"Why is a share price on the market higher than value of the company portion it represents? In a very basic sense, stock is purchased for the ownership of a company. It‚Äôs price grows on the market following supply and demand, and as such the price of a single share may rise as the value of a company rises and more people want to buy that share than those willing to sell.

But why is the portion of a company granted by that share worth less than what it‚Äôs paid for?

Suppose a company has a book value of $180M and has 100M shares outstanding on the market for $5. Its market cap, which encompasses its intangibles and growth potential is nearly 3x as much as its book value, signaling the market believes the company is and will continue doing well (in theory).

Now since a share indicates owning a portion of the company, a single share in this company is worth 0.00000001%, or if the company liquidated its assets today, $1.8; so why would somebody want to buy a share of a company for more than what that share is worth? Is the delta between its intrinsic value and the market value the ‚Äúmark up‚Äù for the current share holder to earn for giving their position away?

This brings up the question, if you exclude capital appreciation from the equation, if the share price on the market is more than the intrinsic value it losses at purchase, the hope would be that over time the value of the company grows such that the shares intrinsic value eventually exceeds what you paid for it, right?"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yes. When you pay for a company you are paying for its future value determined by revenue, earnings, etc. The exact opposite happens with a lot of companies where the share price is less than BVPS (book value per share). That‚Äôs because people are predicting that the company will be worth a lower valuation in the future usually because of lower revenue, lower earnings, possible bankruptcy, etc."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Y'all are over complicating. An equity share is not so much a ""piece of a company"" as a claim to a share of a future stream of earnings. If the company does not return a portion of those earnings to the shareholders as yield, then the excess earnings should increase the value of the shares. This is why the price to earnings ratio is more widely used than the price to book in share price evaluation."
04/03/2021,stocks,"A typical valuation if you‚Äôre outright going to completely buy a company would be assets + 2-10 years of earnings.

04/03/2021,stocks,"""encompasses its intangibles and growth potential""

Its right there in your post. You don't buy a stock for what the company is worth today, you buy it for what it may be worth in the future.

Price to book value can be one measure of whether a company is overvalued or undervalued, but you shouldn't worry about paying over book value for a stock. If the company is a good company, book value will never come into play because the company won't ever be liquidated at that value. In fact, if a stock is trading at, near or below book value, that may actually be a sign investors think the company is in trouble."
04/03/2021,stocks,Because people speculate on the future of the company to a degree. Too little and the market won't move very fast but too much and you get a bubble.

04/03/2021,stocks,"Yes that‚Äôs what I mean.   Companies get bought all the time and there‚Äôs a need for the purchaser and seller to somehow establish a fair value of the entire company.   This fair value is almost never just the sum of the assets and cash of the company, but usually includes projections for future income and/or liabilities.   

The point is that the combined share holders are essentially holding the entire value of the company; and it‚Äôs normal for this to include projections of future revenues in addition to current assets.   So seeing a company with $1b in assets trading at a market cap of $3b wouldn‚Äôt really raise my eyebrows much unless there‚Äôs some other unusual thing going on.   In many cases it could be a solid buy at that price."
04/03/2021,stocks,"> Obviously I can sell stock that has risen in price and profit

That‚Äôs how the investment is repaid. 

Think of it this way. A dividend stock pays part of its earnings out to shareholders. A growth stock takes its earnings and reinvests in the business, expanding its future growth and revenue prospects, which are then reflected in the stock price. Either way, investors benefit from earnings."
04/03/2021,stocks,">Obviously I can sell stock that has risen in price and profit,

so you do understand."
04/03/2021,stocks,"The only reason I asked is because anytime one searches ‚Äúwhy does stock rise‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy does one buy stock‚Äù it‚Äôs revolving around owning a piece of a company that has value that is growing or has potential to grow.

It begs to ask, if you pay for such a portion, but your portion is lesser in value than what you paid, how do you get the value back for what you paid (if you exclude the possibility of selling for a capital gain). Basically, how do you get your value back from the company, and that‚Äôs to hold the shares at a lower cost until the value per share surpasses that cost along with dividends to recoup your initial investment."
04/03/2021,stocks,"What you‚Äôre asking is almost intrinsically nonsensical. How do you get the value of the share back if we pretend that it can‚Äôt be sold the same way it was bought? Well it can be sold the same way it was bought. You‚Äôre using a very odd way of assessing that value. If a company were to collapse to the point where all that remained of your share was their assets, guess what? The assets would already have been downsized to try to recover capital. The value of a company is not just assets, but assets and earnings, but not instantaneous assets and earnings. It‚Äôs more like a running evaluation of future earnings, depreciating assets, debts, liabilities, etc. 

But there are other considerations. Dividends are one way you get value added for owning a piece of a company. Usually companies that are stable in a stable market will pay out dividends as a share of profit. Expanding companies, or companies in a growing market are not expected to pay dividends because they can reinvest their earnings to fuel further growth, raising the value of the company and their shares. 

And now let‚Äôs get back to the part where this is a market, not a vending machine. Some stocks are more popular than others so they sell at a premium. Others get impacted by fear or short selling or ethical concerns and sell at discount. The market constantly fluctuates. Disney, Apple and Tesla sell  at a high price to earnings ratio while MO (owns Phillip Morris among other things) sells at a much lower price to earning ratio. That has less to do with intrinsic value and everything to do with popularity and perception. There are no hard rules about how much a stock should be priced, only general trends and rules of thumb. 

Does any of that make sense? When I get long winded I tend to go off on tangents, and at the end I‚Äôm. It really sure if I address the points I intended to.

Edit: I guess the core thing I‚Äôm trying to get to here is that at the end of the day, the shares are worth whatever people will pay for them. And it really is that simple. All the other stuff is just how people try to decide what the shares are worth. And yes there is a disconnect between the day to day of the company and the shares."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yes it makes sense, however I was mainly concerned with the recoupment of initial investment.

If I pay into a business to own 25% of it, my investment is made while by receiving profits from that business (think Shark Tank). This concept doesn‚Äôt hold with stocks (to me) if the company isn‚Äôt paying dividends yet, and the value I paid for my portion of the company was more than the present value of that portion of the company.

Yes, excluding the sale of my position is nonsensical, but this concept applies for when people hold onto quantities of stock to receive dividends as passive income. They must put down a sizable investment to recoup their investment via dividends over years. Until the money they spent on the investment has been paid back by those dividends, they are still at a loss; we are excluding the gain on the value of their stock because they need to hold it in order to receive the dividends, so it can‚Äôt be used here.

So when somebody says ‚Äúyou buy stock to own a portion of a company‚Äù, nobody wants to buy a portion of a company at a loss, so how would holding the shares earn your investment back and earn you income if you didn‚Äôt want to dispose of your ownership in the company. This boils down to dividends and or liquidation; the former is self explanatory while the latter revolves around ensuring that even though you spent $X, if the company collapsed and paid out to its share owners, you would at least (hopefully) recover your investment and then some."
04/03/2021,stocks,"You can sell the shares for more money than you bought them for. That is literally the value proposition. You put money in, the company grows, the value of the money you put in grows until you pull it out.

It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúyou buy a house so you lost money doing that, how do you get the money back if you can‚Äôt rent it out? Like my only options are renting it out or tearing it down and selling the materials.‚Äù No... you can keep the house intact and sell it at a profit when the market goes up, if the house is well maintained and in a good location. Same with stocks. If you pick them well, they will grow in value and can be sold. 

Actually this raises another point. You can take out a mortgage on a house. Borrow money against the value of the house at reduced interest rates. Same thing with stocks, they have  value that can be borrowed against at reduced interest rates (depending on broker). That money can be used to buy more shares, or spent on expenses. So you can, in a way and at some risk, access the value of your stocks without selling them."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yes, I understand you can always sell them at a profit in those scenarios, but again, the question is around owning the shares in perpetuity and realizing a gain.

In order for one to overcome the loss which is from the cost of the share compared to the intrinsic value that share holds, it must come from dividends, a buyout or a buyback. I want to be a part of the company, so selling my position makes no sense. If I want to earn my money back and make profit on top of that, this comes from dividends. In the case when companies don‚Äôt pay dividends, I would have to wait until they grew big enough to do it at which point the rate dividends come back might repay my investment faster, or sell the shares at a profit.

People who are living off dividends don‚Äôt sell their shares, they need them for the payments. So in this case, if it cost them $280K of an investment in order to receive $1K/mo in dividends, then it would take 23 years for the dividends to repay the $280K it took to achieve this payout, before the dividends would be considered profit.

In the house analogy, I profit every day I use the home. I have a dwelling. I can host dinners. I can host parties. My investment is already returning on itself in the form of use. When I am ready to leave the house I can sell it for a profit if the market is in demand, or rent it out later; this is the selling of position vs dividend equivalent to the house analogy you gave.

However, unlike the house, until the dividends from a stock pay back my initial investment, I am not earning anything from them day to day. Their extrinsic value comes from speculation on the market that one day I will be receiving dividends as well as their value, my position, has increased to meet the growth of the company."
04/03/2021,stocks,"If you never sell the shares, you‚Äôll never realize a gain except for dividends.  You have to sell to realize a gain.

Basically it boils down to you sell your ownership interest on to a bigger sucker who will pay more than you did.  Or you hold it forever until the company ultimately goes tits up. 

Shark tanks is really a terrible model for raising capital, it‚Äôs literally named shark tank.   Maybe it‚Äôs an Ok decision for people with an idea and no concept of how to raise money for a business, but I wouldn‚Äôt say many of them get a fair deal.   The sharks are usually capitalizing on some skill set or network they have that will help contribute to the future success of the startup, so it‚Äôs more than just a monetary valuation transaction."
04/03/2021,stocks,"‚ÄúBigger sucker‚Äù

Exactly my thoughts. I‚Äôm either hoping somebody wants to buy out my position at a chance to earn the same thing I did, but wait, what is that?

When you invest in something you want to earn your money back and then some. This comes in dividends or buybacks if you want to stick with the company, otherwise your forced to sell your position.

If you wanted to own a part of a company and make money from owning it, that‚Äôs dividends, which aren‚Äôt always guaranteed but they may be one day."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yeah that‚Äôs basically it.   Ultimately on a long enough timeline all company‚Äôs value will go to 0.

At the end of the day there‚Äôs a lot of money to be made or lost playing in the stock market, but value investment seems to be what‚Äôs attractive to you and that‚Äôs a great way to build wealth over time.   Evaluating the fundamentals like balance sheet and assets to find solid value that you‚Äôll buy and hold for longer periods time.   Either that or become a dividend focused investor so that you‚Äôre regularly getting a portion of your investment back.

2021-04-03 03:52:11,stocks,"Question on drawing s/r using different time periods So I am a swing trader and like to hold for a few days to a week but I had some questions in regards to drawing support and resistance lines using different time periods
-

So I absolutetly love using the weekly chart to draw my support and resistance levels

My question is in regards to the daily and intraday time frames, let say the weekly resistance is at $10 and the daily or intraday time period actually brakes this level and is now climbing up, would it be stupid to jump in since the week isn't over therefore the weekly candle hasn't closed above $10 therefore I shouldn't jump in.

Summary
-

Should I stick with one time period, so if I draw s/r using weekly, I shouldn't ever check other periods, my entry/exit should be strictly using weekly? 

OR is it okay to use weekly and daily together but not use intraday? So weekly resistance at $10, and daily closes above $10, while weekly candle hasn't closed above $10 yet, wouldn't be a good idea to jump in because by the time the weekly candle closes above $10 I would have missed out on the run

TLDR
-
 trade using same time period or can we make exception to use weekly and daily timeperiods together?"

2021-04-03 03:45:21,stocks,"Will SpaceX eventually kill ULA? I am getting more and more bullish on companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, mainly as a result of this ever worsening new cold war. Another area that interests me, when thinking about Boeing and LMT, is their joint venture....the United Launch Alliance.

ULA is SpaceX largest domestic competitor. After doing some research I have found ULA launch systems vary from $11K/kg payload to $20K/kg kg payload. SpaceX cost on the falcon 9 is $4k/kg payload. In addition, on their wiki page, I see their staff count has been decreasing significantly year over year.

Is ULA just going to eventually be left in the dust by SpaceX?

I am curious if anyone else has done further investigation on ULA, and their long term success / failure, and its effect on LMT or Boeing stock."
04/03/2021,stocks,"SpaceX already would have killed ULA if not for two things:
 * ULA is well-ingrained in Washington DC
 * The military (rightly) wants the country to have at least two launch providers to maintain access to space if there are issues with one.

SpaceX has been eating ULAs lunch for years now. From a bullish point of view, they are 5-10 years ahead of not just ULA, but anyone else in the launch business. And SpaceX is using that lead to develop an even bigger, more reusable rocket.

The ULA does have one hope: That SpaceX leaves the LEO launch business. That is a means to an end for SpaceX. If they manage to kickstart interplanetary travel the way they intend, I wouldn't be surprised to see them stop offering launches to Earth orbit and leave that to ULA.

Only problem is that there are 5-6 other companies in SpaceX's wake looking to get a foothold in that market."
04/03/2021,stocks,"SpaceX will more than likely always be more cost efficient, but will they completely kill ULA, who knows."
04/03/2021,stocks,Between Space X and Rocket Labs... yes.
04/03/2021,stocks,What is keeping ULA competitive is their Centaur upper stage. It is more efficient and reliable than anything else currently being built. The Centaur upper stage is used for most deep space missions.
04/03/2021,stocks,"But do you think a possible mix of spacex and blue origin with their new glen would be able to put ula out of business?

I'm not super deep into ula but seems like the fact they are just now looking at reusability is a massive problem"
04/03/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôve worked at ULA for 6 years.  No but not for the reasons everyone else here is talking about.  Cost is not the factor.  Assured access to space is the factor.  You don‚Äôt put you‚Äôre country‚Äôs future into one basket.  Consider how frequent falcon is upgraded.  If an issue rolls through production unseen and they need to rework everything they have the country can‚Äôt wait.  Always have a backup rocket.  Vulcan and falcon9 will both be successful.  Blue origin is too far behind at the moment and companies like rocket lab do not come close to the capabilities atlas/centaur Vulcan/centaur provide.  Also,  LSA has already been awarded to ensure this for foreseeable future."
04/03/2021,stocks,"In a capitalist view, yes they would go under

However, we operate under cronyism, ula will be around for a long time."
04/03/2021,stocks,I don‚Äôt know much but I do think that ULA has a better track record in terms of rockets not blowing up with payloads on board. So they win contracts for super important government launches.
04/03/2021,stocks,"The biggest factor is when will spaceX kill an astronaut(s). As soon as they have their first mishap with a human crew, that will drastically hurt their stock. And if you dont think it‚Äôs going to happen, then I have a bridge I want to sell you."

04/03/2021,stocks,"Astra will demolish a lot of the big players with their $3.5M per launch and are now doing around $.5 BILLION in commercial and government sales per quarter.

Astra in a few years will be pretty ubiquitously known as the FedEx of space delivery. None of the other big players can beat their price point, they're just so much more efficient and built to mass manufacture and scale."
04/03/2021,stocks,"The DoD and NASA won't allow SpaceX to kill ULA even though by rights they should since they don't want to go back to having only one launch provider.

I also doubt the feds want to see a return of the kind of industrial espionage that spurred the creation of ULA to begin with."
04/03/2021,stocks,"SpaceX will not kill ULA, also don't get on the price per kg as a use for comparison, ULA has better reliability and redundancy and don't keep changing their designs which is taken as an important factor by the military and also although NASA prefers a cheaper launch cost (their advertised 62M$ is not what they charge) they also keep redundancy in the loop. There is still a lot of competition in the Industry which might play a role on the redundancy factor but prices are only going to get cheaper and it will be a challenge to hold the same profit margins since there is just too much supply for a particular demand."
04/03/2021,stocks,Yes.

Moreover I wonder how much demand there is for heavy lift. Looking at falcon heavy launches vs falcon 9 there have only been a few falcon heavy launches. Seems like there is not much demand at the moment, and i think starship will meet any future demand and hopefully be even more cost efficient"
04/03/2021,stocks,There's a tesla in helo orbit that might have a different view

04/03/2021,stocks,"> ULA Delta IV rocket is the only American Launch Vehicle to be capable of heavy lift. Something SpaceX do not have.

The Delta IV heavy is the second most powerful rocket in the world, behind the SpaceX Falcon Heavy. You are right that the Delta IV is the only American heavy-lift launch vehicle, but that is because the Falcon Heavy is technically a super heavy-lift launch vehicle."
04/03/2021,stocks,They stopped making delta IV and have enough parts for maybe 4 more launches
04/03/2021,stocks,"Lmfao how can you even say that when there 5 attempts can‚Äôt even go to orbit, valuing them at around 2.5b market cap, compared to rocket labs 20 successful launches to date market cap at around 4.2b

04/03/2021,stocks,"> Why on earth would they do that?

Because they wouldn't be on Earth any more! (*cringey rimshot*)

Seriously though, I didn't say it was a strong hope - just the main one they have.

To entertain the idea further though, I could see a future 20-30 years down the road where LEO launches make up such a small portion of SpaceX's revenue - between Starlink and a hypothetical interplanetary economy - that it's just not an efficient use of resources to keep offering commercial launches there.

For several years now, Elon has sought to go ""pencils down"" on Falcon and Dragon and figure out plans to retire them because he considers them dead-end product lines. He wants to take the engineering and manufacturing resources from that and put them on his Mars projects.

And it's not like the LEO launch market is very big. SpaceX has had 20-odd launches in the last few years that totally could have gone to a commercial customer that was ready and waiting. But those don't exist, so SpaceX uses them to launch their own satellites."
04/03/2021,stocks,"True, but they've generally set themself up as a small payload launcher - their 300 kg payload capability doesn't overlap much with Atlas's 10,000 to 20,000 kg payload capability.

Even the in-work Neutron rocket from Rocket Lab is only targeting 8,000 kg, so it'll be a while before they really start pushing ULA out of the top 2 American launch companies."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Mhm, agreed."

04/03/2021,stocks,Oh fuck how did I forget that.
04/03/2021,stocks,"I think of Starship more as a landing craft (for the moon or Mars). As far as I know, it would be launched from Earth on a larger rocket. It's got fairly massive potential in it's role, though, if they can work out the kinks.

The Falcon 9 should be sufficient for most near-Earth orbit missions. The Falcon Heavy would be used more for heading out towards the moon or launching heavy payloads like maybe space station modules, so it may be more useful further down the road from where we're at now."
04/03/2021,stocks,Heavy launch is important not purely for the payload but for the ability to travel further than LEO
04/03/2021,stocks,"Starship will be able to lift more than any rocket ever built, it will be the largest and most powerful rocket ever built by a good margin. Starship will be able to get more than 4 times as much mass to LEO as the delta iv heavy."
04/03/2021,stocks,Most ppl don‚Äôt even know rocketlabs is VACQ
04/03/2021,stocks,300.0 kg is 660.79 lbs
04/03/2021,stocks,"While SpaceX wants you to think of it as that, for the foreseeable future Starship is just a HLV like Shuttle-C would have been, a large payload bay *atop* some fuel tanks instead of hanging off of one as Shuttle-C would have."
04/03/2021,stocks,Interesting; I guess that makes sense. Always good to have one's perspective widened.
04/03/2021,stocks,"The exciting thing about Starship as a HLV is that it's the true package TSTO that say, Space Shuttle, was meant to be. One big booster that lands, one big payload craft that flies to space and returns, both parts fully reusable.

The concept is as old as the 1970s, but unrestrained by congressional concerns this time. The only logical improvement would be a replacement of the SH booster with a flyback booster, like a flying Saturn V as seen in the [Right Side Up timeline.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6enhV8WQAAVV0M.jpg)"
04/03/2021,stocks,"That's cool. Clearly I need to update my knowledge of it. I haven't paid a whole lot of attention to Starship aside from it getting some R&D funding through Artemis. On the other hand, the Falcon 9 comes up extremely frequently for me."

04/03/2021,stocks,"You want to liquidate some of your position in a stock that you've entered into at different times and prices?

&#x200B;

From an ""I need some money""-perspective, it doesn't matter which shares you sell, X shares at $Y dollars gets you what you need in cash, now, $(X\*Y). It doesn't matter one tiny bit that the sales proceeds are to pay for 2020 taxes. And any sales gains will count towards 2021 taxes.

From a gains perspective, I'd sell the ones I've made least money on, therefore, owe least taxes on (in 2021), if that includes loses then the loses offset gains.

UNLESS your 2021 tax situation is such that your long term capital gains can be taxed at 0%? Sort term capital gains are taxed as income, get bundled in with income, are subject to standard (or itemized) deductions limits, etc., but basically are taxed at your income tax tiers.  IF your earned/job income and unearned income is below certain thresholds then there might be room under the (long term) capital gains thresholds to not pay taxes on the long term gains. And then I'd sell the long term held shares. A game of juggling your 2021 tax brackets and thresholds, see [https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/#brackets](https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/#brackets). Anyway, this gets a bit tricky, and with 3/4 of 2021 still to go, probably too many unknowns. So, I'll stick to my original of selling the ones you've made least on."

As the title suggests, I'm currently looking for sectors in which to invest other than Tech (I'm already quite tech heavy). 

I'm 21, I have read quite a bit about this and with 2 years of experience in this world, prefered to start early because ""Time in the market beats timing the market"", with a moderate risk tolerance. 
I understand the benefit of being diversified, but I personally think that knowing the sector that you are invested in gives 95% of the time better results than ""diversifying for the sake of doing it"", that's why I went tech heavy for a start.

I have no preference between value or growth, but I value some kind of stability AND dividends (aiming for looong term holding). 
150% a month plays are nice, but I prefer avoiding the -60% that comes the following week / month. 

My current holdings are:

26% TSM (Semiconductor manufacturing)

26% AAPL (Tech)

24% NVDA (Tech / Semic / IA)

24% LOGI (Computer peripherials)


EDIT: That's only taking the stocks % into account. Cash makes for ~40% of the portfolio right now.

The portfolio took a beating last month, but It's already well into the green realm. The beating is what showed me that I should consider diversifying to other sectors (after looking at them in depth) for the sake of stability. 

Currently considering: 

Volkswagen (Automotive sector, future safe EV play, nice div., Germany's prefered child)

Blackrock (Financial sector, too-big-to-fall, the ""safest"" I found)

Paypal (FinTech with a foot into the crypto world lately)

And a couple of spanish small caps (I'm from Spain) that I know locally that will grow during the upcoming years. 

Any suggestion of which I should choose, or what sector should I look into? (Green energy might be recovering, but I find it to be still overvalued for an entry point. Got a friend really burned with ICLN's European version, IQQH).

Thanks!"

04/03/2021,stocks,"Looks like IMHO, your portfolio could use some diversification. I do agree - it is helpful to fully understand the sector you invest in. Also to ""fully"" diversify - then just buy a few ETF's and leave them alone!

Maybe add in a financial - I like C, or WFC over BX. 

Then add in a green sector: I like JKS, CSIQ, or TSLA

Maybe a dividend stock: I like LUMN, and T

I would look at the 5-year charts for your existing holdings - and compare the chart to these ""new"" stocks and make sure they all just move together...

Also - This is just my opinion - holding cash is not sound, especially at your age. Instead of cash, I hold real estate or a stable dividend stock that is safe and does not grow...With the 10-y bond still below 2%, holding cash seems foolish...

This is essentially a data software service but one that requires on site staff in some cases. I mean, I don't see what secret sauce they have that can't be copied by poaching some talent."
04/03/2021,stocks,Why are people so excited about these contracts? These are a dime a dozen for normal tech companies yet you don‚Äôt hear any press releases
04/03/2021,stocks,So many people are going to loose big on this mediocre company...
04/03/2021,stocks,"I went to the company website, looked under press releases. There was nothing about this."
04/03/2021,stocks,"What does GS think? They run the show. Assume they‚Äôll pump it. Write Calls. Then crash it.  

It‚Äôs not personal. It‚Äôs just business. But sometimes you can be a few minutes ahead of them.  Their ALGO does have a few bugs.  

As one of the lead developers told me way back when: we don‚Äôt even understand how some of this code works.  And the guy that wrote most of it died years ago.  It just works. No one want to break it. So no one touches it. Heck some of it is still in LISP. 

It just works. 

True story from the belly of the beast.

04/03/2021,stocks,Meme stock
04/03/2021,stocks,"89 million seems terribly small, the good news here is they are moving into energy in addition to defense. Govt is ridiculously compartmentalized and the more drawers they can pull dollars out of the better.  Good luck.  This company helps big brother do some shady shit so in full disclosure I‚Äôm idealistically bearish but realistically neutral"
04/03/2021,stocks,Is Palantir a good investment?
04/03/2021,stocks,Is 500 shares a good position in this company?
04/03/2021,stocks,"Gross that‚Äôs 6 cents per share. Net that‚Äôs probably less than 1.

Not really a market mover."

I actually bought stock Tuesday. I hope it will go up up up."
04/03/2021,stocks,Just looking to profit on their April Double Click demo day.  Way overvalued still but the potential is there.  Next earning should be a good indicator if I‚Äôm gonna build a position or stay in the sideline until another catalyst can make the Apes hype it again.
04/03/2021,stocks,I think anything under 20 is a solid entry point
04/03/2021,stocks,What do you make? What‚Äôs the contact for? 89 million for data?
04/03/2021,stocks,Pump any day now.
04/03/2021,stocks,Down Monday so
04/03/2021,stocks,Buying the dip on tuesday
04/03/2021,stocks, is palantir now profitable? does anyone know?
04/03/2021,stocks,Fuck Palantir. I bet the stock went down because more people just learned they have to work with Palantir.
04/03/2021,stocks,"It will be worth 88,950$ and drop 4% on the bad news edit, changed a % to a $"

04/03/2021,stocks,The future is priced in
04/03/2021,stocks,I hope you don‚Äôt mean your PLTR shares....  Why do you think they will lose another 20%? ü§î

04/03/2021,stocks,"PLTR is the company of the future, and it will always be."
04/03/2021,stocks,Why would share price slide with the news of an 89 million contract? Apologies for being a noob.
04/03/2021,stocks,I hope so then I can buy more

04/03/2021,stocks,I came here to say this exact thing
04/03/2021,stocks,Owning PLTR is a form of masochism.
04/03/2021,stocks,I own PLTR and I could certainly use some good news. It has been a painful stock for me.
04/03/2021,stocks,lots of time to buy shares my man
04/03/2021,stocks,Right! What are the odds this thing goes up on new contract news. Takes a fuckin bulldozer to move this biatch
04/03/2021,stocks,Have you tried shorting at $23 and buying at $21
04/03/2021,stocks,LOL. This came first to mind when I saw the headline
04/03/2021,stocks,I finally sold most of my palantir to make room for more GME buying. I believe it will be worth more than it is now but I don‚Äôt know how much and when. They leadership team seeking shares a few months ago was not a very good sign. I lost faith around that time and would have lost less money if I just got out to then lol.
04/03/2021,stocks,I keep buying more shares and I'm just hoping things go north soon
04/03/2021,stocks,"BB and PLTR are sister companies I swear. Good news and you dip, bad news and you dip."

04/03/2021,stocks,"If you want to bitch about it, start shorting it."
04/03/2021,stocks,That's what you get for investing in meme stocks
04/03/2021,stocks,Exactly. Why does a losing stock get so much attention on reddit? The whole point is to identify stocks with potential growth whether short or long term. Here we are down 20% and it's still being hyped. Bears?
04/03/2021,stocks,'Potentially' worth 89M over several years. this is basically nothing to get excited about
04/03/2021,stocks,"Ikr, feels like November/December again when people would constantly post about these new deals as if that's all that was needed for the stock to moon."
04/03/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs about $70M more shares they‚Äôll just sprinkle on the admin and employees so they can sell them at $16
04/03/2021,stocks,"It should. This is god damn pennies in the grand scheme of things. Not even 100m . And this is over a few years. They should do better. After existing for over 17 years now...... 

They are expected to win contracts... that‚Äôs nothing special at all. This is like saying omg raytheon got a new contract to build more missile defense systems!! That‚Äôs unheard of! Stock should go up on this surprise news!! 

How the hell does this contract scream ‚Äúomfg amazing!! This totally justified them being valued at nearly 50 times sales!! Why aren‚Äôt investors buying the stock!! Don‚Äôt they know it‚Äôs so cheap!! ‚Äú"
04/03/2021,stocks,I hope you‚Äôre 64.9 years old
04/03/2021,stocks,This stock hasn‚Äôt even existed for 6 months yet and it‚Äôs already mooned once and now people complaining it taking foetever up go up?? Bruh it‚Äôs been only a month since it was all time high listen to the CEO and buy something else for short term
04/03/2021,stocks,"wouldnt it be better to do slow growth investing in your roth and mess around with growth in your cash acc lol 
20-40 years until you turn 60 could be a lot for a unproven company like pltr"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Same seems like a decent play, I‚Äôm 21 so I have time, it‚Äôs not a big position, but I‚Äôve picked up about 50 shares through the dips and beginning. S&P keeping me strong tho üò≥üòÇ even have that brick and brick and mortar company that sells video games in there"

04/03/2021,stocks,Son? I've been searching for you
04/03/2021,stocks,"From the many interviews I've seen, the CEO always bashes out to the public to buy other stocks than Palantir. So, yeah, head of the company depromoting his company's stock.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Well, i think most recent investors in palantir come from GME and they all are craving for ""catalysts"" to shoot the price up 69.420% in pre market. Hard to understand why PLTR is still a meme stock, since it's been behaving like a long term play for a while now"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Are you really complaining about PLTR and BB posts while the whole front page of wsb is filled with GME? Plus, Tesla delivery numbers were posted on all pages that had anything to do with the stock market. If Tesla and Apple sold their products to large business clients and their deals were worth in the range of 100 million dollars, we would have seen numerous posts about that too."

04/03/2021,stocks,BB warrior here... Damn too soon
04/03/2021,stocks,20% of my portfolio is in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it
04/03/2021,stocks,BB barely makes any money
04/03/2021,stocks,Exactly. Why do people even mention it like it's a big deal.  Meanwhile microsoft got a  21 billion contract.
04/03/2021,stocks,What is the PEG Ratio for PLTR?
04/03/2021,stocks,ITT: people who repeat the same fucking thing every time they see the letter PLTR in a sentence
04/03/2021,stocks,"This is the way.  

They could add literal Jesus as the new CEO and have a new contract with heaven for $2 billion annually. 

Stock price?  Down 4%."
04/03/2021,stocks,We got rid of the dead weight huzzah. Now we rise! Baibai.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Whoops.

Great company. I think you might regret not holding these long term in the future"
04/03/2021,stocks,I foresee that you will be able to get back in at a 35\~40% discount later on in the not distant future.  I will buy my first PLTR share at that level.
04/03/2021,stocks,PLTR is a piece of shit. You sound like a bag holder.
04/03/2021,stocks,Hyln is way undervalued.
04/03/2021,stocks,"They have a few moats in that it‚Äôs hard to replace infrastructure once it‚Äôs already implemented. It can be done but it would have a significant cost. Costs that palantir has paid. Basically it‚Äôs first mover advantage is significant. All of the software has to be implemented by highly paid developers. Plus now gov employees are trained in how to use palantir. This isn‚Äôt to say that people can‚Äôt compete for future contracts, but that it‚Äôs going to be tough to take away contracts from the agencies palantir already works with. 

This contract is a good example. It wasn‚Äôt bid out because they already had Palantir. No one could reasonably bid lower for the contract. It‚Äôs not enough to justify the valuation, but it‚Äôs enough to say they probably are going to keep whatever agencies they already work with."
04/03/2021,stocks,Call Of Duty. It's basically US is the boss and Russia/China are the enemies. Pretty simple imho.
04/03/2021,stocks,May I ask in which industry are you working? Just curious.

04/03/2021,stocks,It‚Äôs one contract yes. Hang in there.. there will be more.
04/03/2021,stocks,Agreed
04/03/2021,stocks,"PNTR depends on your investing time horizon. If you‚Äôre ARK, it‚Äôs 5 years. If yours is shorter, you should consider stop buying this meme stock and actually invest, or buy it with 1-2% of your assets and forget about it for many years."
04/03/2021,stocks,Tim Duncan approves.
04/03/2021,stocks,Yeah because market caps have shown to matter in this market...
04/03/2021,stocks,Market cap is one way to measure a stock. Sometime the stocks are driven by sentiments
04/03/2021,stocks,"Their market cap is $42BB. A $40MM contact is nothing when it‚Äôs trading at 25x 2025 sales (this is counting they even get to profitability by then) and they lost ~$1BB in 2020. 

Let‚Äôs take a more realistic number of 10x 2022 sales which imho is still generous. This would put the stock price around 9 bucks and that‚Äôs still overvalued."
04/03/2021,stocks,Sounds like you lost a whales cumload of cash on this.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Should be trading at 1.2X multiples of Lockheed, Raytheon and other defense contractors."
04/03/2021,stocks,It also crystalizes their long-run potential
04/03/2021,stocks,Which timeline?
04/03/2021,stocks,Yep
04/03/2021,stocks,I got excited....then opened the comments
04/03/2021,stocks,Meme stock.
04/03/2021,stocks,"I think the execs have to sell some because they have a huge tax bill coming at the end of the year, and also have options that they‚Äôre gonna exercise in December. So it looks bad that they‚Äôre selling, but it‚Äôs not a bad thing necessarily"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yeah this is one of the reasons people dont understand why good news != stock up


Sometimes you have to look at fundamentals. And getting government contracts is and has been literally their job for their existence. They start losing them and they are fucked. Lol"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yeah.. what the hell are they spending the billions on... they have the software, developers, and what appears to be a solid sales team. Time to make money"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Opposite really. I do my speculative trading in my Roth with my long term holds in my normal account.

The tax man cometh and he is a dick. No worries about STCG or wash sales in my Roth.

If I ever truly need the Roth money, I‚Äôll just pay the penalty, but I doubt I ever will."
04/03/2021,stocks,I have always done safer and dividend stocks in my roth as I can only add so much to that every year and dont want to risk it dropping a lot. But.... had the majority of my GME been in my Roth i would be much happier not paying windfall taxes.
04/03/2021,stocks,You know what they say: You gotta risk it for the biscuit
04/03/2021,stocks,Trying to buy a nice dinner?
04/03/2021,stocks,In all my years of investing I have always bought 100 shares of a stock. For whatever reason this year I started buying small amounts. It‚Äôs probably because they waived fees so now I can just buy one or two shares when something is down without paying for the trade
04/03/2021,stocks,"No reason not to sell covered calls with 100 shares, unless you're absolutely married to this stock."
04/03/2021,stocks,FUCK OSHKOSH
04/03/2021,stocks,Bingo. It was go up like 4-5% to start the day and end the day down .5% like always
04/03/2021,stocks,This is so wrong it‚Äôs unbelievable lol
04/03/2021,stocks,Your mom could grow 400% and it wouldnt surprise me either
04/03/2021,stocks,"Cause if its one thing we've learned in 2021, its that stocks are logical and follow company spreadsheets.

See: AMC, GME, Hertz, hell ACY declared bankruptcy 4 days ago, yesterday the stock jumped 350%.

Volatility is crazy right now and people are trading on feeling."
04/03/2021,stocks,"I'm in energy too lol, ex-international IPP and consulting.

There is a sense of momentum when it comes to winning contracts in heavily regulated and generally conservative industries."
04/03/2021,stocks,"You're actually right, my bad. Part of the J&A references that Palantir is already configured and deployed to nuclear enterprise safety professionals and working through an established NNSA ATO which I incorrectly interpreted as being on an existing NNSA contract ‚Äì maybe it's referencing a commercial deployment with similar requirements. Either way, the award is a couple months old and $89m is just a ceiling value over 5 years (only $7m is currently funded) so I wouldn't expect it to have any effect on the stock price."
04/03/2021,stocks,This is the only good news that I like seeing here. Them working with the DoE as a new customer.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Dude i can write an entire Bible about negative things to say in regards to GME. I don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs on the front page of WSB though that entire subreddit has been taken over by children. I care more about this one and r/stockmarket. And whenever I see a post about PLTR or BB it‚Äôs the same thing. Some sort of deal/patent was signed/approved and the expectation is that the deal/patent is going to make the stock pop and that‚Äôs where y‚Äôall are going about this all wrong. Because when you actually read the details about the deal/patent it‚Äôs actually a really small thing that‚Äôs either been priced in already, is old, doesn‚Äôt really change anything, or isn‚Äôt as big as the post makes it seem. This post here says potentially 89 million but when you read the details it‚Äôs only guaranteed 7 million. With PLTR having a market cap of 42 billion they need to be signing 300 million dollar deals, billion dollar deals to move the stock higher.

You guys are literally looking through every single crevice, digging through every Nook and cranny, analyzing every single statement put out by the company. You made this same exact post in multiple subreddits, as you have with previous posts about PLTR. It makes me question your angle here.

And here‚Äôs the thing. I have a bunch of shares of PLTR. I want the company to do well but I also understand the importance of patience. People are always talking about how they are in it for the long term but then when the stock tanks 5% on news like this they lose their minds! I mean if you‚Äôre in it for the long term it shouldn‚Äôt matter and if you truly believe in the company let them do their thing and stop obsessing about it."
04/03/2021,stocks,"PLTR's business model is signing contracts. PLTR announcing a new contract is like a car company announcing they've sold XX,000 cars this month, or Walmart announcing they've sold $XX million of toilet paper this month.

It doesn't mean anything unless it's hugely unexpected."
04/03/2021,stocks,By then they'll need a thousand...
04/03/2021,stocks,"Idk about that. My favorite investment Pinterest was as much a victim of the March downturn as anything else, but it's up 12% on the week. Rising yields just seemed like a convenient excuse for profit taking at the top and consolidating a new position at the bottom. I think the swing out of tech is as over as it's going to be for right now"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I almost bought into Workday from the TV commercial they put out. You know, the one where this guy on a video conference references Workday but his mic is off and everyone else answered Workday while he was muted?  Maybe I should not due my DD by making conclusions from TV ads."
04/03/2021,stocks,"No I‚Äôm extremely long on pltr, their business model is great, I appreciate their company values and they will slowly grow to have more and more customers in commercial sector as time goes on."
04/03/2021,stocks,I‚Äôm going to play them on a run up to earnings that I‚Äôll probably sell before
04/03/2021,stocks,If the government was a stock you could make free money shorting it

04/03/2021,stocks,"? Im not selling, I would buy. I made 30% on june call spreads from march 26th to 31st on this last dip."

04/03/2021,stocks,"I am posting this so people could be informed, plus those kind of news are pretty important for companies like PLTR that are just starting to expand. I know that PLTR is valued high right now and positive news might or might not change the stock price in the short-term , but they definitely give a positive outlook about the company's long-term sustainability.
PS: I am in on PLTR since the DPO. At that time the high-value of the contracts and the fact that those kind of news catch the media eye, definitely helped the appreciation of the stock price and pulled a lot of retail investors. However, I am well aware of the fact that while the company matures, contract announcements will probably stop being market moving news, cuz investors will start giving more and more value to the financial results of the company."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Well, not really. Yes, contracts are expected for PLTR but new contracts and extensions of contracts mean that they are successfully landing and sticking clients. 

On top of that, many of its contracts have been with new private clients, which is important because 1) they have launched their new proprietary platform that allows them to launch service for private clients faster than ever and 2) some of the primary criticisms that PLTR has faced have been being too concentrated on single clients and unethical clients. 

So many of these contract announcements are promising. It‚Äôs less like hearing that Walmart sold a certain about of toilet paper, and more like hearing that they sold a certain amount of online sales, which is important because that‚Äôs been a growth target for them and has significant implications on their status and future."

04/03/2021,stocks,The problem is that they haven‚Äôt transferred seamlessly into the commercial space.

2021-04-02 23:48:34,stocks,"Am I understanding 1k margin included in Robinhood Gold correctly? Tried posting several times on /r/Robinhood, but my posts are always auto deleted no matter what topic I write on...so hoping I can ask this here.

I've seen several posts on this from googling but none that ask some of the specifics. Please tell me if I have anything wrong.

1. The first 1k is ""interest free""/already rolled into the monthly $5 price of gold.
2. You don't have to pay anything back until you sell whatever you bought with it OR you get margin called.
3. You won't get a margin call as long as your portfolio is at least the value in your account options under Margin Investing --> Margin Maintenance. (This is what it says on the app)

So is there any reason not to at least invest that in some stable ETF instead of not doing anything with it? I understand you could lose money on it, but as long as I maintain the maintenance I won't get called so I don't have to sell and could theoretically wait 10 years for a gain before selling? Do I have that all right? If so, it seems like a waste to not do something with it, rather than have it sit there."

04/03/2021,stocks,"1k margin for 5 dollar monthly that's about 5% annually ""interest free"""
04/03/2021,stocks,"Do they have a certain amount interest free once you sign up for premium? Also how is there flow? I'm somewhat annoyed when I do market buys, it sure seems like sometimes when I execute the buy, the price purchased seems a non trivial amount higher, like they let someone get in between to skim. Then I do limit buys and the price drops that low and it doesn't execute and then the price rises up again.

I remember one time I had to wait 30 minutes for a limit buy to execute when the stock was sitting at that price."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Except I understood it fine and was just looking for confirmation to make sure I didn't do something I didn't intend to do, like you see sometimes with people posting big mess ups on options.

04/03/2021,stocks,"I use TD, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúpremium‚Äù service you get double the amount you deposit in margin to use, though obviously margin is risky and you should avoid using it. Never had an issue with limit orders sitting there and I don‚Äôt use market orders."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Yes, but I'm not looking at it like that. The tiny cost of gold is worth it for me for the level 2 data and reports. I wasn't using the 1k free though and it seemed like a waste."

So, on Xioami smartphones, there is an App Vault on left most screen. Amongst others, it shows stocks. But ""*Invesco Solar ETF (TAN)""* is not showing up on that.

Xioami uses Webull, but that app (if downloaded separately) shows the stock on its Widget, so it must be Xioami's fault / error.

That‚Äôs the tech side and it‚Äôs not insignificant.

Don‚Äôt disagree they primarily make cars.  Also agree they‚Äôre severely overpriced and overhyped.  I just think that the market as a whole doesn‚Äôt think they‚Äôre ‚Äújust another car company‚Äù.  That‚Äôs something to consider in valuations.

All cars today are digital/drive by wire, I think we'd be hard pressed to find a car using analog tech.  Sure, it may look and feel like analog, but every input you make in your car is converted to a digital signal and done by a computer...  Even your blinker, your wipers, turning the radio on, turning the steering wheel, stepping on the gas or brake... All digital."

if the company doubles in value, it doesnt matter how many shares you have.  all that matters is that you invested $20.

2 shares at $10, company doubles, now you have 2 shares at $20.

04/03/2021,stocks,"Aircraft autopilot is different though, there‚Äôs a lot less aircraft in the sky than cars.  The average pilot has more training than the average driver, and (hopefully) none of them are intoxicated.

I think autonomous driving is a serious technology.  It seems crazy now but I think only because it‚Äôs not widely adopted.  The more autonomous cars there are on the road, the better autonomous driving becomes.  More human drivers = more variables and unpredictability for computer to take into account.  If all or most cars are autonomous and talking to each other in real-time though, it‚Äôs a lot easier to react to road conditions and adapt accordingly.

I‚Äôm not saying that cars nowadays are analog, but the perception is that they are.  The first iPhone technically didn‚Äôt do anything technologically revolutionary, but it did bundle all these existing digital technologies into one UI (tablets, MP3 players, GPS, etc), and off of that Apple was able to leverage their software capabilities.  I think saying Tesla = Ford = GM is like saying Apple = Nokia = Motorola.

There's actual fire here guys, not just the usual ambulance chasers.

Read this disaster of an earnings call:

""Today, we announced that Renato Giger, who I have worked with and known for many years, joined us as our Interim CFO.""

New CFO announced on the earnings call? WTF.

Craig Irwin (Analyst):

Okay. The second question there ‚Äì there's a little bit of a contradiction in your prepared remarks. So Tony, you talked about how engineering IP broadens your TAM, but then you announced that you're deemphasizing your engineering services. Can you help us resolve that and maybe give us a little bit more color about why you would deemphasize engineering, given that the original story was ‚Äì it would subsidize the development and broaden the partner opportunity with potentially multiple hats on their license.

Tony Aquila (Executive Chairman):

Yes. So look, I would say that from the comments perspective it was a contradiction, it hasn't been a contradiction from my statement. Look, as I said in the new marks we looked into this, it kind of goes to your first question too with the talent war and everything just the $25 million, it would yield us. We at the board really feel like the best thing to do is to accelerate our derivatives and focus our talent on creating IP for the company. You also have a lot of IP leakage when you do this work. And from my perspective, if I had been more involved earlier certainly, I certainly once I started ‚Äì I invested and then I took the chairmanship, we started the analysis. I had concerns about this. If you study all OEMs, you can find a partnership or something like that if it makes sense. And we'll continue to look for things, but to be a contract engineering house is just really not going to drive the best shareholder value.

WTF!!!!!

Craig Irwin

Okay. And then, this is a tough question, but all the institutions are going to ask this question tomorrow, right? So first Alex Marcinkowski is gone now Paul Balciunas. These are the two gentlemen that sold the pipe. A lot of people met with them and Ulrich for your de-SPAC process. That's a fairly heavy turnover and we didn't have Ulrich on the call today, which appears like I'm missing. Can you maybe talk about the high turnover and what's going on here; and is Ulrich still Chief Executive Officer?

Tony Aquila

Yes. So look as we've kind of been navigating through going public. We're obviously bringing in people with extreme public company experience. We're making the call today from Dallas, Texas; not in California, due to the California still in a bit of a lockdown, and Texas being wide open. So yes Ulrich is still currently the CEO of the company, and as far as with respect to your comment about turnover, its true there's been some turnover in these positions, but we've been bringing in people that one and they have worked together as I mentioned in my comments, and this will stabilize. I think a lot of SPACs and a lot of companies as they go through this migration will be bringing in people with experience in the public markets. So, I just think we're a bit ahead of it and we'll stay ahead of it, and as we navigate this step-by-step quarter-by-quarter.

Craig Irwin

Last question, if I may. You're obviously deemphasizing engineering and engineering services. So that seems to imply that the original SPAC model is no longer guidance going forward. Is that accurate?

Tony Aquila

We'll be giving ‚Äì we're not going to give ‚Äì at this point that doesn't make sense to give guidance until we complete the work that we have started. And with all that's gone on in the SPAC world, in the pre-revenue side, we want to be very conservative. If you look back at the history of the team that is now more and more coming into play, they've been ‚Äì they never missed consensus. And so doing this at a high public company standard, I think is important for all SPACs, and certainly we're going to do our best to lead the way here. And so we will be step-by-step building this and we will be delivering information as it is. It is known and contracted, not based on light rev ‚Äì reservation models. I think that's dangerous. I think it could be somewhat misleading.

And so typical of any leadership change at different standard comes in and will guide you through that. Kamal, we'll be following up with you on a regular basis. Certainly do acknowledge your point; Craig that you got so to speak, as you mentioned showed a different model, but this model is better from a return on capital basis. And I think as you work through it, you'll like it, especially the areas and the margins of the areas we plan to operate under. So let's kind of table that and discuss through it.

Craig Irwin

So I will acknowledge that these are significant surprises on the call today, and that's not ideal after a SPAC IPO process. So, I just wanted to underline that? Thank you.

Tony Aquila

Totally understand your understand your perspective; obviously I wasn't here when they did the original model, but certainly wanted to get ahead of this and explain to you how this really is going to work and how to build a profitable company, which we've done in the past. And we intend to do here, but hey, we understand the situation it puts you in and we work closely to rectify that. So you can understand very clearly where we're going. And I think once you do, you will understand why we made these changes.

And the ‚Äúpivot‚Äù in strategy, which was not announced prior to de-SPAC, and the revised guidance significantly below what the SPAC said it would be, is also terrible. 

Spin this however you want, all this was avoidable, and a company with a competent management team doesn‚Äôt do this.

They just told everyone that the company they invested in isn‚Äôt what they‚Äôre going to be. And it‚Äôs not going to be led by the people who led it. If that doesn‚Äôt have you revaluating the stock, then you really have given new meaning to diamond hands."

2021-04-02 21:39:48,stocks,"Tesla Deliveries Smashed Expectations  

Tesla delivered a great bit of news Friday. The electric vehicle pioneer posted a healthy quarterly increase in deliveries, a number more than double 2020's first-quarter total.

Investors had been wary of the figures -- not because of demand or competition, but because of the global automotive chip shortage. Their worries turned out to be overblown.

Tesla delivered about 185,000 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 181,000 in the fourth-quarter of 2020 and about 88,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2020. Year-over-year growth is more than 100%.

Wall Street estimates ranged from roughly 162,000 to about 172,000. Estimates had fallen from more than 180,000 deliveries, mainly because of the chip shortage.

Tesla didn't mention the chip shortage in its report. It did point out, however, that the Model Y has been received in China. The company began manufacturing the Y in China a few months ago. .

The result keeps Tesla on track to deliver the Wall Street consensus of roughly 800,000 vehicles in 2021, up about 60% year over year. Tesla didn't provide 2021 delivery guidance, but didn't that it was targeting 50% average annual unit delivery growth for the foreseeable future."

04/03/2021,stocks,"It makes a lot more sense to see Tesla as a battery company. For a few reasons:

* Eventually stationary storage could be as big a business as automotive
* Many automotive companies split out there auto and heavy trucking divisions, but Tesla really treats them as similar products because battery limitations are the key constraint for everything they do
* Every big step forward the company has made has coincided with a change in battery tech. The original roadster using lithium ion cells, the S using their pack architecture (that still hasn't been copied by anyone), the 3 cane with the first gigafactory and the 2170 cells, and their next generation of cars (Plaid+, roadster, Cybertruck, Semi, etc.) are all based on the 4680 cells and pack design).

I think a lot of competitors put too much emphasis on the cells, and not enough on the battery. Cells will always eventually just be a commodity product, their price and quality comes down to material costs and manufacturing. But the tech to turn cells in to a useful battery is really underappreciated, and it's an area where Tesla has had an advantage since day 1. And it's arguable that their advantage has actually been growing, compared to either the industry average, and maybe even compared to their closest competitors.

I could see a day in 10 years where Tesla is becoming a battery and software company and leaves the rest of the manufacturing to legacy companies. That's assuming of course that Tesla doesn't end up as a leader in manufacturing along the way."

04/03/2021,stocks,"> Because they buy their batteries from Panasonic

They buy cells from Panasonic (and lots of other places too). But a bunch of cylindrical cells wired together doesn't make a useful battery. In fact, even getting them wired together is something of a feat. Like I said:

> Cells will always eventually just be a commodity product, their price and quality comes down to material costs and manufacturing. But the tech to turn cells in to a useful battery is really underappreciated, and it's an area where Tesla has had an advantage since day 1

Tesla is currently the only company that's made large EV batteries out of cylindrical cells, they're also the EV leader in a number of important metrics. So there's two ways we can explain this:

* Tesla is making the key component of their cars in a worse way, and has somehow managed to be an EV sales leader
* Making batteries out of cylindrical cells is an advantage, but it's difficult

Tesla had published countless videos from inside their factories, done tours, filed patents. There's tons of video and interviews out there showing and discussing just about every step in manufacturing every part of their cars. It's a worthwhile exercise to go and try to find anything about the way they construct their battery packs. Find any video, or any employee talking about it, or anyone ""off the record"" talking about it or any patents about how it works or what they're doing. Or just find someone who saw it and says that they're not allowed to talk about.

It's a complicated process, and either it's just dumb luck that this is the one part of the entire manufacturing of the car that's never been filmed or publicly discussed (or barely even mentioned). Or they're doing something they're very protective of. At the very least I think we can say we don't have enough info to conclusively say it's easy and they've got no advantage over anyone else."

04/03/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt know how much you know about Tesla, but they are currently building 2 more car factories to come online in Q3 of this year in addition to the 2 that they already have. Each car factory has a capacity to produce 500k-1 million vehicles once fully expanded. So the capacity is there for growing at 50%. How about the market? Tesla is an absolutely viral aspirational brand, with close to zero marketing costs and actually zero advertising. 5 years ago literally tens of thousands of people around the world stood in line to reserve Tesla‚Äôs Model 3 and another few hundred thousand reserved online. Elon Musk has 50 million Twitter followers. Every car that Tesla sells is the sales leader in its class. Tesla‚Äôs brand is strong enough worldwide to easily support 4 million sales annually provided that they have the right models. Right now, Tesla just started delivering their Model Y in China, and they won‚Äôt start delivering Model Y in Europe until later this year. They are also about to sell a refreshed version of their Model S/X, the Cybertruck, a Semi truck, a new roadster, and are working on a $25k car due in the next couple years. So the models and options are there to support the growth (my breakdown for 2025 sales: 2 million $25k car units, 1.15 million Model 3/Y units, 350k Cybertruck units, 100k Semi units, 120k Model S/X, and 30k Roadsters). How about Tesla‚Äôs history in achieving long term production growth? In 2014, Tesla outlined a 500k target for 2020, and wanted to grow 50% per year. In 2020, sure enough, Tesla sold 500k vehicles and grew from a revenue base of Ferrari‚Äôs size in 2015 to 7.6x that in 2020, so mission accomplished. Now Tesla says they expect >50% unit growth over a multi-year time period. They have the capacity, the brand and market, and the history of long term execution. 

After reading this, you might still think it‚Äôs worth doubting Elon Musk and Tesla. So tell me, what exactly do you think will prevent them from growing according to their ambition?

Also Tesla has >45% institutional ownership, so I am curious why you think only retail owns Tesla stock."
04/03/2021,stocks,Lol. Retail investors do not move TSLA by hundreds of billions. Where is your source for only retail investors go in on TSLA? Sounds like you are the one making up numbers to fit your narrative.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Ok so you didn‚Äôt really give any good reason why Tesla can‚Äôt grow sales to near 4 million by 2025. ‚ÄúCompetition‚Äù isn‚Äôt a compelling reason because more EV models will just grow the EV pie which is less than 2% of auto sales today. Besides, I already factored in competition in my projections.

I think Tesla will sell pretty much every car they can make for a while because their brand is that strong. Again, new entrants in the EV market will mostly grow the overall EV market pie rather than steal sales from Tesla. Currently, Tesla is on track to grow sales 70-100% this year while the overall BEV market grows 50-70% despite all the new entrants. So I actually think that all that new competition will prevent Tesla from growing market share further and actually reverse some of the gains Tesla is about to make in 2021/2022 by 2025. 

The global trucking market is over 2 million vehicles, I am assuming Tesla can conservatively capture 5% of this market with the excellent battery tech and economics of their electric truck plus the ability for autonomous platooning. 

Here‚Äôs an example of Tesla being best in class: the Model 3 outsells the previous leader in midsize luxury class, the BMW 3 series, worldwide. 

Tesla‚Äôs institutional ownership is like 10% lower than Apple and Amazon. That‚Äôs a laughably small difference. You think that 10% more ownership by retail makes it a bad stock? Lmao"

Also, 45% is actually quite low. let‚Äôs look at another high growth company in the s&p 500, >84% ownership. that tells me that the only non retail owners are the indexes of the s&p 500. is that not a lot of retail investors to you? tesla stock price has come from retail investors buying in because they like the brand. the brand helps the company, but fails to help the stock price when it‚Äôs inflated to the point that all the growth you and everyone else expects is priced in."

I‚Äôd love to see how you got the 50-70% yoy because the actual data pans more towards 50%, years that showed minimal total sales don‚Äôt count. this year is not a good data point as the pandemic skewed any data. let me put this into perspective, you think that 1 in 5 evs sold will be teslas, when there are so many other brands, just because they have elon. there are only so many markets that tesla can be dominant in, and i don‚Äôt think that the 25k, unreleased car, can compete with other brands that aren‚Äôt just american brands. tesla is an american brand because it caters to americans. they go into suv‚Äôs and pickup trucks because americans like big cars. europeans love european car brands, and you assuming that they will adopt tesla like americans is awfully prospective.

uhhh, idk what metrics you are looking at but 58% and 45% is not 10%. also, look at the market caps of those companies, 58% of 2 trillion is 1.16 trillion dollars, compared to 45% of 600 billion which is 0.27 trillion dollars. there‚Äôs a reason why you see so much more volatility in those stocks because the real money is with the investors that don‚Äôt react to elon tweets.

But 200 share as a ""high growth ecommerce powerhouse"" is something I could see. That puts the mcap of gamestop around 13b when chewy is 33b and constantly exceeds expectations. 

Video gaming industry has a total addressable market of 151B and a compound annual growth rate of 12.9%

Pet industry has a total addressable market of 99B with a cagr of 4.9%

So the market for the video gaming industry is bigger and faster growing.

So the Financials and I don't have the numbers in front of me but if I recall gamestop ended the year with 400mill cash 225m liabilities so they greatly improved the Financials and avoided missing the payment on their March 15th notes(which was the bear these when gamestop was trading at 5 a share that they were going miss that payment and perhaps no longer be a going concern), and even though eps decreased, comparable store sales increased by 20% and online increased by greater then 130%... 

Also, almost 50% of leases expire in 2021. So there could be further considerable cost cutting measures this year.

So I could see by end of year if ""chewification"" succeeds being worthy of a 20-30b mcap by eoy.

But if it doesn't the downside is the same as others who have tried to pivot to online and failed like RadioShack... in which case gamestop would be worth not much and we could see gamestop with poor fundamentals worth maybe it's book value if that so less then 1B mcap...

So as a valuestock a Benjamin Graham with a wide moat cigar butt... I wouldn't invest in it unless it was less then 20/share.. 

Me myself personally I'm willing to take the risk of gamestop having a successful turnaround that would put it around 500/share eoy with fast growth afterwards... but that's what I mean when I say a binary outcome.. if he doesn't succeed in the cost cutting, lowering retail footprint, transitioning to an Amazon like website with a loyal customer fan base, while fighting against the fact that people can download from consoles, then gamestop is worth just the sum of parts and could be back to less then 10 eoy."

04/03/2021,stocks,"You're completely missing the point with technicalities. The point is Tesla is about 1/4 EV and 1/5 of all plug ins. This is not supporting the theory that legacy car manufacturers are behind and Tesla will join ""any day now"". They are already there and growing. Yes Tesla is still number 1 worldwide, but not nearly the dominant player their valuation makes them out to be and their competition is capable of getting market share, which means that them investing as heavily as they are will bake Tesla's job much harder then when there were 3 or 4 other plug ins and none very exciting. 

Now you can believe Tesla will continue to grow. It might and my girlfriend is long on it too. My advice is that discounting companies with the financial resources legacy carmakers have and thinking they are idiots who won't put up a good fight is a huge mistake. Take into account in your valuation of Tesla that VW, Toyota, Honda, GM, etc. will likely take at least as much market share as they do now while the EV market grows, probably more even (Toyota is at 0% of battery only.

Anyway... In doing more research about dividends I found out that all you need to do to receive it, is to buy the stock 2 or less days before the ""record date"" to receive the dividend. I also learned that if you trade the stock within 60 days of the record date you get taxed at your income level and... The price of the stock drops by the dividend amount the day after the record date.  After holding it for 60 days, the tax rate is much lower. 

Seems like a reasonable strategy would be to find some trusted reliable stocks that offer an annual dividend, invest just before the record date, hold for 2 months for taxes. To give the stock time to rebound after the stock price drop from the dividend payout. Then you could rinse and repeat with next stock, or simply move your money into the next thing you want to take advantage of.  

Is this already a strategy? Do people in this sub do this? If so are the calendars or a cycle that people use?

Edit: thanks for the replies so far, people are asking why don't I move the money into xyz stock etc instead. Here is my reasoning from another comment.
The reason why I could see it being beneficial is that I at certain times have money sitting in my brokerage account from selling a stock.  Then the money sits a bit before I find the next ""big thing"" to park my money into. The thing might take some to present itself. I would like to park my money in a annual dividend stock for 2 months receive the dividend, and hopefully the stock is higher or equal to when I invested 2 months prior. Of course all stocks could go down. But instead of risking my investment into something that only benefits me if it goes up. I'm risking my investment into something that benefits me if it goes up or stays the same.

Essentially, I'm trying to reduce risk and gain profit. If the dividend stock is the same price or increases after 2 months I profit.  

If I invest into a non dividend stock I lose if it goes down or stays the same. (Time value of money)"

[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-CAPL/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-CAPL/)

For me, it's all there - reopening play that has not fully been priced in, exposure to rising gasoline prices and demand, consistent and high dividend payer, RSI is stable, MAs are all on point, P/E ratio among the best out there in any industry, uptrend is steady with entry points along the way...

This stock is largely flying under the radar because it gets lumped in with the ET / ETRN / EPD crowd - relatively safe, longer-term energy plays with dividends...which it is.

BUT

It's fairly valued - or even undervalued - moves in a sector that is currently largely accurately priced, has plenty of room to grow as gas prices increase - see CDC travel release today (!) - and you can tell your family you bought it and they'll think you're not a degen from Upcountry playing with stonks like it's the floor at the MGM Grand. 

Daily trading volume is low, so price movements are somewhat stable. Last time it flash dropped in isolation was because they announced a cut to the dividend yield in May 2017. That is unlikely to occur again, and certainly not in 2021.

I see this as the perfect spring and summer accessory for your ROTH IRA brokerage account. Let it ride and get a cool $2 in dividends a share over Q2 - Q4 2021 ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CAPL/dividend/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CAPL/dividend/)) - note that the value of these dividends could go up 10% or so with increased earnings due to higher gas prices and convenience store performance. CAPL had paid upwards of $2.40 in dividends a share in 2017.

In February 2020, prior to the COVID crash, they were trading at $19.35 on gas prices of $2.50 a gallon ([https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM\_EPMR\_PTE\_NUS\_DPG&f=W](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=W)). If they break through 19.35, I think we could see a return to early - mid 2017 share prices. 

Daily trading volume is low, so price movements are somewhat stable. Last time it flash dropped in isolation was because they announced a cut to the dividend yield in May 2017. That is unlikely to occur again, and certainly not in 2021.

This isn't a ""can't lose"" - but the dividend cushion means you could easily take a scalp here of nearly $2.00 a share and break even. If you think there's room to grow in travel - and I believe there is, at least in terms of interstate travel by road - I believe this could be a + $3 - 4 a share play by the holiday travel season when you incorporate dividend yield and stock price increase, which should be wild. 

***TL;DR:*** *CAPL could offer 15 - 30% upside over the next 8 months, with roughly 10% downside protection built in at current share prices due to dividend yields.*"

-Tesla reaches scale production of Model 3 in min 2018, leading to huge Model 3 Sales as it worked through pre-sale backlog

-But by 2019, production capacity outstripped domestic demand, leaving Tesla with excess Model 3s it needed to sell - so it started exporting Fremont production despite its own overseas factories already under construction


-During this period, two CAOs one CFO and several GCs were replaced and Tesla restated its financials based on revised revenue recognition relating to lease sales.  Red flags abound.

-Under new accounting, Tesla could recognize lease sale as regular revenue so long as the expected future fair market value (determined by Tesla) exceeded the guaranteed buyback price.


-But looking closer at the description of these new leases, it seems tailor made to overestimate sales via financing agreemens (repos) with offshore entities. 


-Only problem is that cars depreciate. In a repo, you pay a higher price at the end of the term than you receive in initially, therefore any sales would have to be written off as the counterparty's ""put"" is int he money - indeed Tesla 1Q2019 wrote off $500M in sales.


-To fix this problem, in 2Q2019 Elon and Tesla make the claim that the Model 3 is an ""Appreciating Asset"" based on its potential future FSD capabilities, providing public corroboration to underpin its accounting claim it was about to make


-Setting the stage for Robotaxi Repo. By claiming the Model 3s were appreciating asset, they could recognize 100% of revenue for their excess production, without recognizing any offsetting liability or write downs as the estimated future value would exceed the buyback price.


-Beginning in 2Q2019 Tesla ""Other"" international revenue mysteriously exploded, as its inventory dramatically shrank. From 2Q-4Q2019 these sales represented 36% of total Tesla revenue. Tesla stopped breaking out this category in 2020.


-We estimate $2.5bn of Robotaxi repos took place over three quarters in 2019. Operating cash flow ex. this amount was negative. FCF was -$2.5bn vs $0.0bn as reported. This could have included up to about 100k cars or likely 10%-30% of 2019 deliveries depending on sales price.

He never said the car is an appreciating asset, he said the FSD package is an appreciating asset which is undeniably a fact as it's gone from $4,000 to $10,000 and take rate's gone up. On top of that, the Model 3 might not be an appreciating asset, but it's a fact that it depreciates [much more slowly than other cars.](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33935142/tesla-model-3-depreciate-electric-car/#:~:text=Tesla%20Model%203%20Bucks%20Trend%20of%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Depreciating%20Rapidly&text=On%20average%2C%20your%20average%20new,of%20cars%20coming%20off%20lease.)"

04/03/2021,stocks,"Some more facts about FSD that torpedo this argument (even if it wasn't obvious it's just a wild conspiracy theory):

* Most cars aren't sold with this option, so even if Tesla was accounting for FSD this way (and it's almost certainly not), it wouldn't apply to most sales. And it's likely that lease buyers are even less likely to pay for the option
* In their accounting Tesla hasn't recognized the full revenue from FSD software already sold. Their accountants and auditors say they can't recognize the revenue until they deliver the product. So they've been able to recognize some revenue as features are rolled out
* Tesla had in the past, and recently brought back, the ""enhanced autopilot"" software option, which is just the existing functionality. This couldn't be an appreciating asset, so all cars sold this way should also be excluded from the ~~calculations~~ *conspiracy theory* (there's no actually calculations we can check in these tweets, just throwing out numbers hint: even *if* it were true the impact would be almost nothing)
* The tweets make it sound like Tesla can't sell the Model 3 because they had one quarter over quarter decline in sales. But Model 3 (and then Y) sales have been trending up in all markets, to record high levels recently.

So, the idea is that, Tesla's auditors won't let them recognize the current (low) sales price of FSD as revenue now, but they will let them recognize the appreciated future value now as a repo agreement? Also, the auditors still haven't let Tesla recognize deferred tax loss as income because they're not convinced Tesla can use it all, but they do recognize this huge future income from buying back appreciating assets?

To accept that this crazy conspiracy theory would be true we have to accept that the auditors are signing off on extremely creative/lax accounting on leased cars, while also enforcing strict/correct accounting for FSD on all cars. Even ignoring that they'd probably be signing off on obvious fraud, they'd definitely be applying two different accounting systems to the same transactions, which would open them up to ask kinds of liability and would likely show up as all kinds of red flags in the reported numbers. Despite all the graphs and numbers they've come up with, they don't bother to go through and show what an adjusted financial statement would look like. For such a big claim, they've put almost no effort in to actually proving out the impact. They're claiming they've ""discovered"" enron like fraud, and the proof is a few tweets and bar graphs?"

04/03/2021,stocks,"Here's a rebuttal to OP's bear thesis of Tesla ""overstating"" their earnings: the exact opposite is true, Tesla has been **understating** earnings for years.

For example there's a $2.02b surprise GAAP profit item [1] being rolled forward on Tesla's balance sheet, that they might recognize anytime.

[1] Source:

> https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm
>
> ""Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance: $2,018m""

These are $2.02b in GAAP profits Tesla was not allowed to recognize yet by the GAAP rules of tax allowance treatment.

But once Tesla's auditors declare it ""more likely than not"" that Tesla is GAAP profitable on a sustained basis, Tesla will **have to** recognize these $2.02b in GAAP profits within 1-2 quarters.

Tesla bears don't seem to realize that Tesla's accounting practices are ***exceedingly*** conservative compared to legacy auto. Here's an incomplete list of the differences:

- Tesla accrues sales & revenue only when the customer has paid, takes physical possession of the car and all paperwork checs out.
- Legacy auto (Ford, GM, Volkswagen, etc.) accrues sales/revenue basically the moment the new car leaves the factory, or at the latest when it reaches the dealership - even if it sits on a dealership lot for months. (See the recent scandal about VW ""self-registering"" over 50% of their ID.3 sales in Europe.)
- Tesla depreciates & amortizes their production equipment on an accelerated schedule of 3-5 years. This artificially increases their D&A expenses on equipment with an expected true life time of 10+ years.
- Legacy auto depreciates & amortizes their production equipment on a slow pace of 5-10 years - delaying the expenses greatly. 
- Also, most legacy auto factories built today will be scrap metal in 10 years, when most sales will be EVs. There's a large wave of forced write-offs of factories building the wrong kinds of cars looming.

These are 3 real examples of conservative accounting practices that understate Tesla's earnings significantly.

The Twitter thread linked to by the OP, conveniently authored by an anonymous person 'TheLastBearStanding', not by an ""analyst"" as falsely claimed in the editorialized Reddit post title, is a hodgepodge of misunderstandings and outright falsehoods about the accounting standards around the treatment of leases. Don't let the length of the Twitter thread bamboozle you into believing that there's any merit to the accusations. Complaining about lease accounting has for years been a favorite tool of TSLAQ bears, as the arcane nature of the topic makes the argument seem sophisticated, and also makes a quick debunking harder. This ""fresh"" report does in fact seem to have been authored in April 2020 - a year ago. There's no serious Wall Street analyst today who claims that Tesla's books are 'fraudulent' in any way.

Tesla has the cleanest books and the most robust balance sheet of all of the automotive sector, by a large margin.

Accusing Tesla of ""accounting fraud"" is a classic ""Big Lie""  moment and projection."

04/03/2021,stocks,"The thing is, the Tesla bull thesis, in its simplest form, is exceedingly straightforward:

- Apple got to 2 trillion dollars valuation by capturing ~15% of the 0.5 trillion dollars smartphone market, selling $1k iPhones at good margins.
- Tesla could easily capture more than 15% of the 5+ trillion dollar EV market, selling $40k ""iPhones on wheels"" at good margins.

Tesla is targeting a future market literally 10 times larger than Apple's main market ...

Today Tesla is where Apple was in ~2009 in terms of phone market penetration - but Tesla has an order of magnitude higher revenue & profit runway than Apple had ...

And here's how it's going:

- **US market:** Tesla has captured ~80% of the US EV market fourth year in a row - while the market has grown 400%. Tesla has, for all intents and purposes, achieved a growing quasi-monopoly - despite EV-hostile policies from the Trump administration and a $7,500 federal EV tax incentive buyers of non-Tesla (and non-GM) EV buyers get today.
- **Chinese market:** Tesla has captured over 50% of the Chinese EV market in Q1 by revenue, growing rapidly, with a Tesla EV factory fully ramped up, a second Tesla EV factory in China ramping right now, and a third Tesla EV factory in China being constructed right now.
- **European market:** Tesla has grown deliveries in Europe by around +100% year-over-year, and their new EV factory in Germany is starting trial production within the next 2-3 months. Tesla's EV market share is the weakest in Europe, primarily because they are not selling their most popular, most popular product in Europe yet (the Model Y).
- **Global market:** Tesla has grown +109% year-over-year in Q1, while their sales are still only scratching the surface of the global auto market at a 1-2% share.

I've seen no good arguments from Tesla bears why Tesla couldn't become the most valuable company on the planet and reach 2-5-10 trillion dollars of valuation, based on their EV market dominance alone.

That's not the views of a ""cult"" IMO - it's a rational bull thesis."

That said, it DOES apply for robotaxis. There's a very real possibility Tesla gets it right first and will have a 100% market share for the first couple of years. This market has similar margins to Apple's software with much higher recurring revenue. If Tesla does figure out robotaxis first, they'll instantly be the biggest company in the world."

04/03/2021,stocks,"> EV margins are nothing compared to the margins of Apple's phones and software.

We can run the numbers to verify my claims. :-)

Tesla's automotive cash margins are actually ridiculously high, they are at almost Apple levels today (!).

Tesla's GAAP margins are highly distorted, IMO it gives us a clearer picture if we look at Tesla's cash margins (""cash from operations"").

In 2020, Tesla's cash earned from operations was $5.94b [1] - almost all of that from their auto business (their other businesses are break-even or even loss makers), on sales of 500k vehicles, on automotive revenue of $26b [2].

That gives us a pretty good idea about average sales price and margins:

- ASP: ~$52k
- per unit cash earned: ~$11.9k
- per unit cash margin: **~22.8%**

Apple's cash margins in 2020? $80.8b cash from operations on $274.5b of sales, or **29.4%**.

And Tesla achieved these margins in 2020 during a global pandemic, which hurt auto sales big time while people staying at home buying customer electronics helped Apple sales.

I.e.:

- Tesla is already within striking distance of Apple's cash margins, while growing so much faster (and less efficiently, because fast growth always invites operational inefficiencies),
- and Tesla is growing into an order of magnitude larger market...

Everyone who thinks TSLA is overvalued should IMO check these figures."
04/03/2021,stocks,"> Yeah but people buy iPhone every year. 

Yes, that's correct - the product replacement cycle is longer - that's why the full EV market is not ~40x but ~10x of the smartphone market.

Note that while cars are replaced less frequently, they generate significant service revenue and used car revenue as well during their years of existence."

That's false, see the source I linked to, of the $5.94b cash from operations, the cash income from ZEV credits was $1.58b:

> There was also an increase of $986 million from additional sales of regulatory credits to $1.58 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020.

And due to global warming getting worse, ZEV credits are a growth market years into the future: in 2020 global automakers made use of over $20b in ZEV credits to increase their income - the bear argument of somehow not recognizing them for Tesla is illogical and nonsensical.

Without ZEV credits all the major European carmakers would be going bankrupt.

Even Volkswagen is buying ZEV credits from Tesla now:

> [**""Exclusive: Volkswagen to buy credits from Tesla in China to comply with environmental rules - sources"" (Reuters)**](https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-tesla-china/exclusive-volkswagen-to-buy-credits-from-tesla-in-china-to-comply-with-environmental-rules-sources-idINKBN2BO53Y)

Volkswagen is benefiting from their purchase of ZEV credits, and Volkswagen is was using about ~$10b ZEV credits from their EV sales in Europe in 2020, why shouldn't be Tesla able to account the $1.5b ZEV credit income in 2020 as well?

The bear argument there doesn't make much sense: taxes, import tariffs, regulatory credits and tax credits are all part of the business environment, they all get accounted as expenses or income."

04/03/2021,stocks,"Yeah, the ZEV credits bear argument is ridiculous and anyone who knows more about it than just having read a comment on Reddit knows it.

You make some good points with the margins. The only counterargument I have is that the gap from 22.8% to 29.4% is still pretty large. It's easier to go from 0% to 6.6% than from 22.8% to 29.4%. That said, I agree it's not unthinkable.

Also, go figure what Tesla's valuation will be if they manage to solve robotaxis. It could truly be in the dubbel digit trillions. Ridiculous as that may sound, anyone who's run the numbers on it knows this is true.

The math is really quite simple, as an example, let's assume Tesla to ramp up to 10 million car sales per year by 2030 (well below their own targets):

* That means 50+ million cars on the road in total
* $500 FSD subscription price per month at a 50% take rate (both conservative if robotaxis exist) gives a $12B revenue per month
* 90% SaaS margins on the subscription (conservative) puts that at a $134B yearly operating income
* That turns into a $107B yearly net income (almost double Apple's current values)
* Multiply by a PE of 60 (conservative for a growing tech company) puts you at a $6,5T market cap from FSD sales ALONE.
* Add to that everything else Tesla will be doing by 2030 and you're already around a $10T market cap with very conservative FSD numbers.

The only question is whether Tesla will be the first to get there and if so, when?"
04/03/2021,stocks,Bush's baked beans? I edited my reply.
04/03/2021,stocks,"> The only counterargument I have is that the gap from 22.8% to 29.4% is still pretty large. 

True in principle, but in Tesla's case there's a couple of additional points:

- Tesla's very high growth expenses are mostly capex, but are also burdening operational cash expenses: which expenses typically lead income by 2-3 quarters, sometimes by more - will automatically become lower as growth is reduced to Apple's slow pace in 5-10 years and income catches up to growth.
- Economies of scale will improve Tesla margins as they grow.
- Tesla still has to take full advantage of Say's Law that Apple's ""ecosystem"" of products has mastered, and which are driving Apple's high margins.
- Tesla is also in the early stages of taking advantage of Wright's Law, the manufacturing learning curve.

Each of these forces is significant in isolation - the combination of them will IMO make up for substantially more than 7% margins.

Also, Tesla is reducing prices aggressively, to be able to grow into the markets it wants to conquer first. At a slower growth pace, should Tesla maintain its quasi-monopoly status in the premium segment, they can charge monopoly margins ...

Tesla's valuation will first be dominated by growth valuation, but then will gradually phase over into an Apple-alike valuation, driven by high margins and a very strong market position."

04/03/2021,stocks,I really don't understand some bears and the negative outlook. It's literally as if people dont want to make money. It's all emotion and zero logic.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Let me try to explain my worries for TSLA (I like the brand!), what you see usually in Europe is that many countries hold out with their subsidies or tailor make them to fit home market brands such as Renault / VW. The same happened 2 years ago when NL shifted subsidies from Tesla price ranged cars to only fit the Egolf (VW). 

I expect this to continue making it harder for Tesla to win in Europe without significant presence here (they are finally building a factory in Germany). Of course you might ask what the value is of NL and the EU as a whole -> it‚Äôs growth surpasses that of China in EV.

04/03/2021,stocks,It kinda sucks knowing I missed out on a lot of gains not investing after March 2020. People are even saying it was easy mode to make money. I was more worried about keeping a roof over my head in middle of pandemic and didn't think about stocks. Ended up getting in right at the top when a correction/inflation panic happened.
04/03/2021,stocks,Coinbase coming in under COIN on Apr 14th.
04/03/2021,stocks,"To my understanding, the moves by bond yields do matter, but the reason it matters is more because of the velocity of the moves instead of where they're at. 

TLT (which is a look at 20+ year bonds) lost 6.31% from mid-February to March 8th (being specific on time frame, because it actually was doing poorly before then but for whatever reason, the stock market was ignoring bonds until this time period). It hasn't really gained any kind of footing since (seen in the fact that we've seen bond yields go higher), but instead of it being like the move that was seen earlier in the year, it has only lost 0.23%, and in that time period, QQQ is +8.21%. 

In fact, during the time period that there was a decent amount of bond buying, QQQ lost 3.28%.

Tl;dr: QQQ was around this level on January 20th and TNX closed at 1.09 on that day. It was about 1.68 yesterday. It's not how high they get, it's the velocity of the move, and in fact, if they move down too fast, it can torch everything (which is what I believe happened on Tuesday)."

04/03/2021,stocks,"I've learned something interesting today. So this weekend I was looking at various stocks in financial sector. Visa, Master Card, FIS, Global Payments, that kind of stuff. Just doing shallow dive. Anyway, I came across American Express. It runs its own payments network and issues credit cards. In my mind Amex is this credit card for rich people that is not accepted anywhere except in fancy places so I thought meh, boring. Well it turns out Amex is like Apple of credit cards. It has big population of millennials who love the prestige of Amex. There is this whole thing about what color is your card and there are rare colors and you get attention with those and then there is black Amex card that is like epic rare. Then there is whole community about gaming Amex points and such. And I know that gaming credit card bonuses is nothing new and people been doing it for ages but with Amex it's not just that. There is genuine community of young people who enjoy prestige of using Amex. And its not just people shit posting. I watched this news video with Cramer where he said that 50% or so new Amex card owners are millennials. Anyway, maybe its not news for anyone else but it was to me. I had wrong perception it seems. In any case Amex is a decent company too but a bit expensive right now. I'll put it on my shopping list and might get some when it goes lower."

04/03/2021,stocks,What are your thoughts on MWK - Mohawk Group? Recovered pretty nicely from 26 up to 31 this week after a falling wedge pattern. Analyst ratings on finviz and yahoo finance are at 45. My understanding is that their tech allows them to either create or acquire brands/products for cheap that are profitable. Revenue growth looks good YoY. The only bad things I can find are that they are not profitable yet (it is a growth stock) and rely on amazon marketplace. I've looked around and found people are bullish and others that wouldn't touch this with a stick. I own 20 shares and I'm up 5%.

04/03/2021,stocks,I learned my lesson about holding today. Got too panicky and sold after I averaged down because I was afraid it would keep free falling.

04/03/2021,stocks,"Can anyone provide me the bear case for UWMC? I want to try to make sure I‚Äôm not drinking the koolaid too much. Everything about them seems amazing except:

1. Small percentage public ownership

3. Super minor thing but the weird shit where they contracted a software company to build a software product and allow them to start distributing the product themselves after 2024.

4. Falling home purchase rates
5. User experience from perspective of the home purchaser(this one is only from a family connection who said creating a UWMC account took way longer than it should)

I have arguments why all these things don‚Äôt matter too much, can someone link a compelling bear case? The fact that this stock has basically fallen constantly and is trading really close to book makes me feel like I‚Äôm missing something."

""long term"" also means different things to different people/young investors. for example to me long term hold is 10 years plus. some investors think that is crazy and only want to hold for a year yet somehow beat the market consistently.

04/03/2021,stocks,Definitely not. AAPL and PLTR are in no way comparable in either content or conversation. AAPL isn‚Äôt constantly pumped based on promised potential. It has solid fundamentals. A proven track record. It makes money. Investments in it are based on its intrinsic value. PLTR is invested in by folks around here because enough people on Reddit are selling its snake oil. I don‚Äôt think ARK buying it hurts either. But PLTR is currently a meme. Apple is not.

04/03/2021,stocks,"I agree with the overall. Stocks are bound to attract gamblers a plenty and I think loads of people education aside just don't have the temperament to actually invest and yeah may be better suited for indexes.  

That doesn't mean that a lot of people who don't treat the stock market as it should can't learn to do it though and I disagree with the mysticism that the market is treated with."
04/03/2021,stocks,"As a whole sure or else most people wouldn't fail to beat the market and the market as a whole wouldn't be driven by emotion but I disagree on an individual basis or else literally nobody would ever beat the market, and there is a decent chunk of people who can do that pretty consistently(I myself am on a 3 year win streak for instance and have for the most part avoided emotionally charged decisions and have held through red periods just fine). I think a lot of that comes with education and patience as well as personality type.

Loads of people are way more logically driven than emotionally and loads more don't even check their stocks much more than once every few weeks or so."
04/03/2021,stocks,"Originally he was more focused on Jan 2021 accounting for the console cycle, he had 1000 call options for that date. He also had Jan and Feb 2020 calls that expired worthless, other 2020 calls were ITM.

He added to Apr 2021s based on price action and other factors. He doesn't 'know' anything such as insider info, etc.. He has a thesis that is widely available and he's sticking to it.

He exercised 500 of his Apr 16th position in Jan 2021 leaving 500 contracts open until now. Apr 16th could come and go and nothing more happens other than he exercises the options and he has another 50k shares.

I've been following GME for over a year, made my gains on the way up and I'm out of it now. I'm sure there could be various factors that push the price higher during April but Keith's choice of date isn't a significant 'something will happen' indicator, in my opinion."

04/03/2021,stocks,"Then why is a buyout a good thing for the investors in the company getting bought out? I'd imagine that you get your exact worth in the other company's stock, yet it seems like if a buyout of a smaller company was announced the smaller company's share price would have a run up?"
04/03/2021,stocks,"That is my concern of currently buying at the $11 range.

04/03/2021,stocks,Yup
04/03/2021,stocks,"I never said that you cannot make tons of money with emotion based trading. Actually I am saying quite the opposite really. Understand how emotions impact price and you can make more money. For example, a stock is going stark raving mad. You take notice while the fever is raging. Volumes are 10 time daily average in minutes after the opening bell and the price is already up over 100%. This is a horrible time to buy, right? Not necessarily. If one times it right with a 5% trailing stop loss you could double your money in minutes, or stop out for a 5% loss. It is very exciting, quite risky, although the stop loss minimizes that, and on average can be quite lucrative. The expectation is that you may only hold the stock for minutes. Nothing about the fundamentals have anything to do with this sort of trading.

Even when you buy a stock after extensive research you buy it because that research gave you confidence in the stock. But next week you could find out that someone was embezzling from the company, or maybe they get sued. All of a sudden all that research does not mean a thing. And, if you are paying attention, you no longer love your purchase.

When logic is used it is used to form an opinion. In the end it is the opinion that matters, no matter how you choose to support that opinion. Many a logical choice fails. Many an illogical choice succeeds. There is always a bit of luck, fate, or divine intervention involved. Except for those market leaders who have enough followers that they can tell investors what to do and count on them to do it despite fundamentals.

What ever you are doing that is working, keep doing it, until it seems to never work anymore."
04/03/2021,stocks,When it comes to your money there are no dumb questions. It does not matter if it is a little money or a lot.
04/03/2021,stocks,The company buying out the smaller company almost always pays more than the current market value of the stock by a few percent more. Before the last couple of years where things shoot up 5% a day it was generally a good deal. The current stockholders of the smaller company assuming they have voting rights have to agree to the buyout before it can go through. It's just that us normal people with our measly 10 to 20 shares don't usually influence a vote a whole lot it's the institutional investors who get the final decision just because of sheer number of shares they own.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Nice. Yeah, I'm currently trying to figure out how to transfer my individual investment account into my Roth that are on the same broker. I wonder if it'll get done before tax day so I can contribute the $12,000? Guess I gotta wait till Monday to ask"
04/03/2021,stocks,The stock market is a delicate ecosystem and inverse bets have a vital role in that. It helps create balance on the whole. A market without shorts/puts would be way more volatile I think.

04/03/2021,stocks,Sounds like a movie plot.
04/03/2021,stocks,"Do it, what could go wrong?"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Nope not illegal. It‚Äôs exactly what ALL major hedge funds, banks or serious investors do! It‚Äôs then typically followed up by a a schedule 13d if buying over 5% (Cant remember exact %). Or at minimum if you‚Äôre a serious investor you‚Äôd enter into an LOI ‚Äúletter of intent‚Äù (binding agreement to purchase X amount of shares). You can also make your LOI ‚Äúnon-binding‚Äù upon specific criteria. 

This is actually the ‚Äústandard practice‚Äù for investors AND the correct way to invest in a Co.!!! Anytime I consider a substantial position in a Co. I call and ask exactly what I want to know. Like your said their operations for example. I ask a lot of other info also. 

ALL Co.‚Äôs will have an ‚Äúinvestor relations‚Äù dept. for any potential investor interested in a large stake, even small or just questions! Again, it‚Äôs absolutely normal! 

Where it is illegal is when THEY disclose specific info of upcoming buybacks, acquisitions, mergers etc. (anything that typically will impact the SP) then YES you are insider trading and subject to the full weight of the law! That‚Äôs if you DID NOT immediately cut them off and report the conversation to the SEC. 

Ask Martha Stewart, as the basic scenario I described above is almost exactly what happened to her; she was told inside info, didn‚Äôt report it, sold her shares to prevent a loss = initiation of criminal SEC Insider Trading law(s). Yes there are several other variations of insider trading too long to type out."

04/03/2021,stocks,"It's not broken. It has evolved or mutated. The way that most people invest and trade is based on how things were long ago, long before the average retail trader or investor could buy stocks on the internet. People today still buy stock using systems developed way before we had up to the minute, and up to the tick stock charts available to anyone, with technical indicators drawn on those charts automatically. People trade and invest the same way people were trading back when it was cumbersome and costly for the average retail trader to enter and exit a position. Today people still trade and invest the same way people did before they could research a company from their couch using Google. 

The market is not broken. It is changing because the people (and the algos) participating in the market are participating under much different conditions than 50 years ago or even 5 years ago."

Using your basis of insider trading then even directors couldnt buy their own stocks because they have too much non public and non material info about their own company- lol. Afterall they would have the most complete info available on a company for ‚Äúevaluating the operation‚Äù etc etc which puts everyone at a massive disadvantage compared to them, yet its still completely legal.

Not the point.

Not even an apples to apples comparison -- employees are HIGHLY regulated when they can trade on their own securities.  My company has multiple blackout periods a year when I cannot buy stock.  

My clients also have the same thing; some tech firms I know of and depending on role, one can be blacked out for up to half of the year from purchasing.

>  Using your basis of insider trading then even directors couldnt buy their own stocks because they have too much non public and non material info about their own company- lol. 

I don't know what you're loling about because what you're mocking is indeed a thing.  My current and my previous company send(sent) frequent communications from legal and leadership to staff clarifying the difference and when we can buy stock based upon such information.

MOREOVER, when I was in B4 consulting and subject to independence rules, I had to disclose every financial interest:  investment, investment type, bank accounts, credit card balance to the firm whether there was a genuine concern or not.

So you may be a chartered analyst but by your latest reply, it's clear your experience is not relevant or current."

04/03/2021,stocks,Were you not aware of the liquidation this week on discovery and Viacom due to the hedge fund going bust? It was all over the news but I don‚Äôt notice you acknowledging this in this thread. Maybe I‚Äôm reading it wrong but it is well known that this hedge fund leveraged to the tits to pump discovery and Viacom and went bust/margin called and then had to liquidate fast.
04/03/2021,stocks,"You responded to my response of me acknowledging that a hedge fund liquidated their positions. However I‚Äôm iffy even on that theory because if they did liquidate their big position in the stock then why did it rocket if the exact opposite is supposed to happen. On top of that this same stock had this issue exactly last year so this makes me think that the hedge fund going down has nothing to do with it. My personal opinion after research is that some form of statistical arbitrage happened twice on this stock especially in this clsss b shares of worth 1 is with 10 shares.

But at the same time he also has some weird political views that I don't like.  I do find him insightful but I don't take everything he says as truth.  If I did I would be much more bearish than I really am.  And I see why you think I got some of my stuff from Schiff - I have been following him.  Good eye."

After DD on AITX, I decided to focus on AITX and no longer have an interest in Knightscope. If I could, I would take out my investment in Knightscope and move it to AITX.

I personally think Grail / cancer patients are better off with this blockage."

04/03/2021,stocks,"So you are saying for example following my table above that on $1000 investment you have $1232?   While I absolutely applaud the optimistic goal, returns like this over a long period of time would be very challenging (impossible) to maintain. Do you do shorts as well? Because being able to time the down turns in the market would be absolutely critical to your plan space‚Ä¶either be out of the market when it turns down or even better to be shorting on the down turns.

To be fair when I evaluate a stock for my own purchase I‚Äôm looking for relatively short term gains of 25%. So my goals aren‚Äôt much different than yours I‚Äôm just a little bit more realistic about the possibility of maintaining that. I guarantee you I‚Äôm not even close to being 30% accurate on picking stocks that will go up 25% in 1 to 2 months."

I know Archegos is a family office, does that mean all the money in Archegos was Hwang's own money? Or has he lost a bunch of money for investors whose cash he was supposed to be managing? If investors, is he likely to be in legal jeopardy for doing something silly with their money? 

Sorry about the basic questions, just trying to learn a little here"
04/03/2021,stocks,"Archegos probably lost money. There are some clear pieces of evidence that show that, because they defaulted on their margin call. Family offices manage high net worth individual's money (non-institutional) so its probably all not his. When it comes down to liabilities when losing other people's money he's probably not liable if it had to guess. Fiduciary responsibilities are for if you intentionally pick a bad investment even though you know other ones are better. On the other hand managers aren't liable for your losses."
