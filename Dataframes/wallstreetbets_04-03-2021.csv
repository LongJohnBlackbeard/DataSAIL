Sexiest thing I've ever heard"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,“Buttlicker our prices have never been lower”
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Endgame DD that actually checks out. Yep, buying more on Monday & holy shit... this is going to be amazing & wilder then the first rocket. Edit: I was buying more on Monday anyways.

✋💎🤚"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m going from 100 to 300 shares on Monday. LFGGGGGGGGG
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Small contention: The price rising from $40 to $90 most likely was not the announcement of the CFO resignation; that's what the news was picking up on. It was because of a gamma squeeze and a whale pushing the price up when market makers had their pants down. It was the last 50 minutes of the day, and some whale pushed the gas pedal. I say this because I don't think 99% of people even knew who the fuck Jim Bell was, so it'd make no sense for everyone to go at the time, ""Oh thank GOD now he's gone!"" The number of people who believe that he was an inside mole sabotaging the company would not be enough to all at once push the price at the announcement of his departure."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the info OP. Some other posts I've seen recently claimed that the company doesn't/can't recall shares, only the holder of the shares can do that. Is that right? What role does GME have over and above recommending shareholders contact their broker?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I also woke up with half a chub.. confirmation bias ^^peaking
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some of the most enjoyable DD I've read on WBS, kudos."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've seen SO MUCH reporting about companies being able to/not able to recall shares, and that it's Texas/Federal/SEC regulations that say you can't recall/announce a recall/declare that shareholders need to recall. 

No one has yet (to my view) actually cited the actual legislation and policies that state it. 

Does anyone actually know? This is one of the few details that I feel we haven't seen actual citations for. I think it's being bounced around in the echo chamber without verification right now. 

Can anyone help? Might make a full question post if this doesn't get any traction here."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Have a reward for staying medicated
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Something to note, this happened without the big players like Blackrock, as they did not call in their shares last year. This year, I bet they do."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"There were articles saying last year the banks didn't give a shit about trying to find people's shares. I imagine this year that 800 number for shareholders to call would be getting A LOT more incoming calls. We all want to make sure our shares are legit and available so we can vote.

Question: if I own more than 1 share share do I get multiple votes?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If this was done in 2020 why would they (Cohen & friends) NOT do it in 2021?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,All of this makes me have huge regrets i didn’t get GME when it was $2  share last year. Instead i got it more recently when it cost way more. But what matters is that i hodl and wait for tendies 🙌💎
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't read the whole post but Ironically I was going over the proxy statement last night and was going to post some interesting finds from that. The board and Kurt were very public in their battle. The board's nominations were ""the most qualified"" and blah blah blah. The ENTIRE board is leaving in June less Ryan and his two seats. 

Kurt wanted to recall the shares and buy back to lessen the float too. These next two weeks are going to be very interesting!!!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m confused about “share recall”. The only thing I can find when I search online is the the owner of the shares can recall them from the person they have loaned them out to. 

Everyone keeps talking about GameStop recalling shares. I can’t find anything about that. A company “recalling” it’s shares would be repurchasing them. 

Is this idea if a company recalling shares something people have just talked themselves into, or a misunderstanding, or is this a real thing? If so, can someone provide a link to a source explaining it."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You should cross post or repost this to rgme
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kurt Wolf is still very much involved and helping shape this with Mr. Cohen. His actions have shown to be invaluable in helping GameStop shift gears!

>Cohen is serving as chairman of a special committee formed by GameStop’s board to help its transformation. Board members Alan Attal, Chewy’s former top operations executive, and Kurt Wolf, chief investment officer of Hestia Capital Management, also serve on the committee."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I think Cohen is more likely to be named President (chairman of the board) rather than CEO. I'm hoping he picks another rockstar to handle the day-to-day executive stuff

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the confirmation bias we all crave.  You’re getting laid tonight.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would GME benefit more from this sideways walk up rather than a MOASS, similar to Tesla burning shorts over a longer period of time to increasingly create supports in the stock price? Just curious if a true squeeze would help their value in the long run, either way deterring shorts is the goal. No fud, just my one doubt on the situation"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"To add onto to this as a warning:

If you have open naked positions elsewhere in the market, you might want to close those positions out before the squeeze, unless those positions are short. GME going lunar means that every hedge fund that is short on it will DEFAULT... they will be margin called and forced to liquidate their assets elsewhere to cover GME. 

This is going to mean that there will be discount buys everywhere across the market and the retail investor will be king."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read this post as if I were Mad Max looking for revenge against the Nightrider (""I'm just here for the gasoline."")  LOL."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm taking out a loan to buy GME.

Good Ape! 🚀🚀🚀"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earliest I think they can suggest a share recall is April 12th, which is just inside the 60 day window ahead of the annual meeting."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The short positions are significantly less than 100% now - so will that have an impact on the amount of change this year?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for this! Excellent info!

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets," If a share recall happens, how does that work for investors? How do you initiate that? A lot of us are outside the USA, does that matter?"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How is this not getting more attention ?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, totally smooth brained question:

How do you know there is a high short interest?

The ""High Short Interest"" site I'm looking at says the short interest now is 24.1%

Before the january squeeze that site showed it was 140+%

Thanks.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"A really important consideration for any DD: dates of when large YouTubers covered the events leading up to January. I joined due to Cold Fusion's coverage. Wish I'd known earlier... Regardless. When these pieces get wide coverage, I imagine they also influence stock value. I wonder if someone can join those dots to inform a wider analysis of GME stock price (and whether petitioning large YouTubers for more coverage is a possible catalyst)..?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, buy n hold, rocket prolly leave soon, maybe have fun with some fd’s bc shorts are fuk? ✅

Edit: some autists had found a backdoor just changing the year in the URL from last year’s vote and found the vote was sch for 6/10/21.  I had followed it myself and confirmed, but the link is now dead.  I believe it was also screenshotted in the ‘other’ sub"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice. I looked at gme last year when I didn't know shit about fuck in terms of investing. Could have purchased 250 shares with the $500 I started out with.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long, informative, yet quite lovely. Was this a meth induced rabbit hole?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sir are months late on this crackhead analysis.  Let me explain to you why this is all smoke.  The majority of the GME shares that are being loaned out to shorts are held by institutions that do not give a shit whether to vote or not.  Literally could not care less, these are ETF’s that hold GME based on a weighting.  It’s just not gonna happen.  That is why nobody cares when short interest was over 100%.  I saw it there a year ago and it sat there for months and shit all happened.  The likely reason for the jump 1 year ago is that is when burry was actually purchasing the shares before actually announcing it.  Full disclosure I have gme calls but I do not expect a share recall to be the reason it goes up."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"While this is about GME, I have a suspicion that the same entities are holding down the prices of both AMC and GME.  Should the SHTF on GME, my feeling is that they will let AMC go to fight the battle on one front and deploy their dwindling capital where it matters.  We might actually see AMC moon before GME."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Back in 2020, would the shorted shares have been from real ones, or from counterfeits conjured up by MMs?  What would have prevented Citadel Securities from selling puts to  HFs like a perpetual motion machine for six months?"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy wall of text
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the DD. I wonder if you know the answer to a couple of question I've had about this for a while.

Last year the board members were nominated to get rid of some old assholes that were not doing their job. 

Do you know if the currently vacant board has to go through the same nomination and voting process, or if they can simply be appointed since there are the vacancies and no one to kick out of a filled seat at the moment.

Last year the float percentages weren't nearly as out.of whack as they are now. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but if there is a vote of any nature whatsoever, it cannot take place until after the squeeze. Because it would be impossible to vote without knowing who holds the shares and CAN vote."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here, have an award I didn’t pay for"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I have one question - in the 2020 announcement that states, “since shares on loan cannot be voted, it is imperative that stockholders who wish to vote at the 2020 Annual Meeting make certain they have their shares in proper voting order before the record date”

I read this as, “if u wanna vote, cover your shorts.” In theory though, what if hedge funds never wanted to vote and didnt care about “their shares being in proper voting order”

Edit: i really appreciate the work you put into this!!"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hijacking this to remind you what ""The Big Short""s Michael Burry told you to do:

Demand that your broker deliver your physical shares.

When he did that, it took them 3 weeks to round up those shares. Why? They didn't actually own them in his account.

This has many, many effects: It forces your broker to actually acquire your shares. Not just on paper, but in reality.

If many brokers are actually forced suddenly to acquire shares, what do you think happens to the share price?

Stop your broker lending your shares. Demand physical paper.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry about your stutter.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets, Some have said that there are some whales battling to take one another  out Blackrock vs Citadel and Blackrock is doing this since Citadel  shorted Tesla to hell.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am a noob ape but always questioned, was that some shorts covering? If it was, I’d guess it’d drop back (which it did to 80 from 200 or so)? Again, I don’t know enough to answer those questions properly...

Edit: I want to emphasize I said SOME shorts above. Not many."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct. They can ask the shareholders to recall their shares in order to vote but the company can’t force it to happen. Also they can’t request until 60 days before shareholder meeting. So earliest they can request it is around April 12 I think.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is true, and last time, a lot of institutionally held shares weren't recalled because firms like Blackrock weren't interested in voting.  There has been some speculation that this year may be different for Blackrock, though."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some have said that there are some whales battling to take one another out Blackrock vs Citadel and Blackrock is doing this since Citadel shorted Tesla to hell. If it is the case, Blackrock would definitely be interested in calling their shares in as it would be the demise of Citadel."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you get the number of votes as you have shares.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, your voting power is weighted based on how many shares you have. If you owned 51% of existing shares then your vote would be the only one that mattered."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta be sneaky. There are shorts lurking.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Better late than never.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine if we had gotten into Radio Shack early 😩
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry I've no source, just repeating what others said: The company can send out a notice to all shareholders saying that they mustn't be loaning out their shares if they want to vote at the next upcoming meeting. This in turn usually causes anyone who owns shares to ring up their brokers and make sure they aren't loaning out their shares to anyone.

This is good in combating shorts because  just 1 share can actually be shorted several times. This can happen when loaned shares are loaned out again- that's how there can be more shorted shares than actual shares.

This is mu understanding of the situation, if you've a source for how a company can change their voting to force it to only allow true shares, and also what voting in this context would mean, I'd be very interested."

They are required by law to. But they can only do that if they actually possess them. And the only way they can actually possess them is to actually purchase them (not just have some backdoor agreement with hedge funds to keep them on paper ... for a fee.)

Michael Burry is a smart dude. Know why? He assumes they're crooked to start with. He doesn't trust any damn one of them. And neither should you.

If you own shares in GameStop, demand that your broker send them to you. The physical written on paper stock certificates.

GME did that twice on the cup people were trying to trace out of its January and March rises, the first of which preceded the earnings sell off. You'll still see the GME cult posting the cup-and-handle memes though like they even know how to cup their brokerage's balls when they're giving them blowjobs at Wendy's for one more day on their margin calls."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Im not saying it isn’t a cup and handle situation.  But every time the price moves it’s the new cup or the new handle until it moves again ad infinitum.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've had to stop swing trading on GME too.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me explain it to you: Some people want to hold for tax reasons. In the US, there are very different tax treatments for short term, versus long term capital gains. So there is advantage in holding, even when your stock is way up. Did you know that you can borrow against stocks? At extremely, virtually no, interest rate?

DFV is holding. Ask yourself why? Now, granted, he did collect $11 million to secure his position. Now, he has plenty of cash to both pay the short-term capital gains tax on that taking and secured his future, but he also did it to secure his longer-term calls. He needs that cash to exercise his calls, should he elect to do that, and I think he will, because that will force his broker to actually deliver those shares to him.

And you bet your ass he's forcing his broker to do that. Why? Because they're all crooks. Forcing your broker to deliver the actual stock certificates to you eliminates their edge."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like Autodesk. Long ADSK off/on since 2008 (back then stock was around $33). Currently a shareholder, no options.

**My likes:**

* TINA. There is no alternative. When building bridges, ships, skyscrapers, consumer products, the cost of a miss due to a software bug is tremendous. Skim a few hundred thousand on software licenses for a firm and expect a few million insurance premiums if your cheap software resulted in a defect that Autodesk would have caught.
* Reopening play for infrastructure. As described by OP.
* University training in the software. Companies know what they get from software and also their new hires.
* Low overhead, high margin business.
* Good acquisitions and growth into adjacent business.
* The move to subscription worked well for Autodesk.
* USA domestic company, so no software backdoors for hostile countries to harm government infrastructure.
* Ecosystem to add to the moat. eg: Shipbuilders can make a shipbuilding module for Autodesk instead of making new shipmaking software from scratch, to a guaranteed audience.
* Not a monopoly. There are alternatives that exist enough to keep antitrust woes at bay.

**Headwinds:**

* Shareholder value gets eroded by their employee option granting over the years. That's life in tech companies.
* PE ratio reflects a lot of years growth already baked into shareprice. Sort of part-and-parcel nowadays in tech growth stocks, but I'd rather take ADSK than a lower P/E unprofitable unicorn just running on hopes and dreams."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, somebody talking about Autodesk on here. I’ve made 6 figures on their stock in the past 2 years. They are going to dominate construction in the next couple decades."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are plenty of alternatives to Autodesk software. I work in the transportation industry, and nearly every DOT and federal agency that works in transportation use Microstation (a Bentley product) instead of Autodesk.

I do like Autodesk (a lot better than Microstation), but I don't see it exploding. There are plenty of alternatives that are just as good."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is so rare I see encouragement for certifications in the same writing as bottleneck, lean, & LEED.   Hats off to you, sir.  I will look into Autodesk.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Like it. But I have to say it. Positions or ban
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Love the sustainability aspect but how would inflation be affected by this? is it such a long time period that it won't matter?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I dont know much about the stock market, since I have only been here for a few months, so I cant really talk about whether this is a good buy or not long term.

What I can tell you is that I am a post graduate german in traffic engineering (yes, that is a thing here. Basically civil engineering with the main emphasis on everything traffic related - road networks, public transportation, airport design and so on) and AutoCAD (by Autodesk) is the only software in the field that is being used even over here in Germany because every other CAD software is really lackluster for those uses."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,2024?! Dafuq
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was also a motley fool recommendation.

Autodesk like many other software companies now wants a subscription fee. Can't just buy a copy and be done anymore.

Short term they have little competition I'm aware of (microstation is the only one I can think of) so would guess companies will pay their fee.

Long term if they get too greedy its possible competitors may emerge. As someone who does side work I can't afford their fees so I use something else.

Seems like a good play for now - not sure how much of the infrastructure package will actually go to infrastructure though have been hearing it's not a while lot.

Gotta feed the piggies their pork.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a mechanical engineer I have used autodesk products.

If your interested in the engineering software niche, check out Dassault Systemes, they make an engineering software that is used for modeling of 3D parts. 

Another one to look at is Bentley systems. They are a smaller company but offer cheaper software then autodesk."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't know if I'm more impressed by your DD or your lack of emojis while making it.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's an art to taking complicated stuff, showing you know what you're talking about, and then simplifying it so others can understand it in a broad sense.  Systems thinking, right?  ""Knowledge"" is understanding how all the systems in the car work, like a muffler or airbags, stereo and sound dampening, etc..  ""Understanding"" is knowing how the car fits into larger systems like traffic and infrastructure and energy, etc., or macroeconomics and the stock market.

I feel like you spent a lot of time on the knowledge part of it but I have no understanding of what to do with the information.

In retard: uh so should I buy calls or puts?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I used to use it as a student when I was interesting in 3d models and modding games.

The huge bottleneck, which I felt with autodesk software and relevant skills is that there is a massive gap between the students and the industry.

You can build your skills and be very good at it, there are companies wanting to hire such people, but the lack of proper formal acknowledgement which can be used as a filter/point of qualification for a company to hire is severely lacking. There barely are any popular universities offering degrees for this and the self taught ones have nothing but their portfolio to show for it which the companies can't possibly sit down and go through for thousands of candidates."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Well though out but isn’t the point of WSB wild risk taking for large benefit or loss?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't own Autodesk as a holder but rather as a consumer. To me Autodesk and Revit can't justify their prices. I understand the main concept behind moving to subscription. But the price is too much for the majority of small architects doing residential and small business sects. In fact most of the work done is for Revit models. But that being said the overall experience is mediocre and for a price at 2k+ it's simply not worth it for the lack of any sort of meaningful updates aside from small convenience factors. If they lowered the price, or even did dual business set ups on a permanent license and upgrade later like microsoft it'd be much easier to stomach. But they only run off subscription and do very little in terms of software updates. Thus in my eyes without a shift in the way they handle their product, they won't be able to get anywhere near the levels of a company like Microsoft. Would I short it? No. There will always be a demand considering it has an education license and is the one most people teach, but in the long term I expect a small decline in value but not by much. If they make that product turnaround, I'd expect it to rocket the fuck out."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s education?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I prefer real CAD platforms.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great DD, love the detail on the industry's potential. What I'm wondering is, what makes Autodesk more attractive than their competitors? I know Procore is IPOing soon so do you expect Autodesk to completely dominate the market, and if so, why?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Labor is superfluous.  Wage labor does NOT have to go on, and federal spending is a sure sign that wage labor is being kept alive.  

Stock market/asset prices to real economy/wage labor is the disparate ratio of keeping wage labor alive to expand capital.  

No other analysis even matters.

Superfluous labor begets superfluous capital.  “Economics” is meaningless when prices diverge from values so wildly.  Everyone is just waiting for the state to subsidize everything."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that the schematics to the Death Star?

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Many state DOTs require the use of Bentley design products for road and bridge work. Bentley is currently private. Autodesk is still heavily used for private sector work but it does have healthy competition.

Edit: Bentley IPO was in September 2020."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll check it out. That's the second reccommendation on a long discussion over Autodesk. Much appreciated and there's certainly much more to be bullish about.

As for solidworks, yeah. It had a good showing in screw manufacturing while I was there. But you know... Buy American."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Easy to be mad bullish on something when already holding.  My big concern for those of us not holding, but looking to buy, is that the stock has already been sent to the moon, sort of like a reverse short, except its the little people (like me) who have to pay the higher price to get a little piece.  Ex. I paid $120 x8 for $AAPL (thats peanuts, but again, Im a little person here).  I saw another post with margin on run chart, displaying margin use at crazy high levels; have assets not been ran sky high to sell to the rest of us at high price?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I use AutoCAD everyday, it is too expensive and taking the power away from the user, may do well for a while but a cheaper software that works better with others will take it's place at some point.  Like Google Docs against Word."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is saying Autodesk is an extremely good long term investment. Think 3+ years. While the DD is good, it doesn't really fit the narrative of wsb where you buy 20,000 weekly calls that expire the next day. Basically, OP is saying buy Autodesk and come back in 3 years to see where it goes"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That one, although I do see that colleges are getting better about it. One of the more painful cases are mostly men in the manufacturing sector, ages 40-60, that are left behind skill-wise."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bentley has delayed their IPO twice, and as of now I dont think has any future public plans.  Its something I try to keep my eye on since Bentley actually has the monopoly on infrastructure design and planning.

Edit: They went public and I missed it."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Solidworks is industry standard in everywhere not involving cars, marine and aerospace."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The subscription fees are insane. They did successfully transition from a paid model to a subscription model, though. And as Andrew Walker discusses, even the firm's that sent an angry letter to AutoDesk about the direction they were heading didn't actually switch software. It's too difficult to learn a new platform and migrate all of your data. That's what investors call a moat. Currently the most popular ""cheap"" alternative is Fusion360... also owned by AutoDesk. As a SolidWorks user myself, Fusion360 is a flipped over port-a-potty of a user interface. I guess eventually someone will come along but industry trend momentum is a hard thing to change quickly.

Still, I don't plan on buying in on ADSK... ever, really."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ironically my company is going in the opposite direction. We're moving away from AutoCAD towards Civil3D/Infraworks, Inventor & Revit (depending on what discipline we're in)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh no! Everyone boo Mexican Joker, kids! Boooo!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,now you're getting a little closer to expectations around here
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah i agree the DD is good, as i said he clearly knows his shit.  just spent a lot of time in the weeds and didn't really get to the point of, what is the actionable advice?  I don't just pretend to be a retard, and I need my DD to at least do a little bit of stock analysis, not just general commentary on the macro."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So basically when interest rates spike this year and the value of its future earnings crumble, buy the shit out of it."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly that is my biggest fear. Seeing my dad struggle with some new features on smartphone breaks my heart honestly. And then you see how many people would be absolutely fucked with automation despite their best intentions to learn but inability to keep up.

I hope they get way way way better at education and hold workshops at several levels."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very true. Being able to wait for your perfect shot and how to know when to push all the chips in the pot makes all the difference. Without naming specific stocks, it does seem like many users here go all in after the train has left the station"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree with the person's assessment above
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit I didn’t realize they’d gone public. Thanks for that. I’ll have to look into it more.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every company seems to have a different reason for choosing a different software company to use.

When I was in college: Solidworks

When I was in oil: Autodesk Autocad/Inventor

When I was in aerospace: Siemens NX

For personal use, Autodesk Fusion 360 has been cheapest for me and what I use. It has its flaws, but generally I found it great for how it auto updates components relative to each other. Also cheap/free.

If I was a large company, I don’t think I’d choose Autodesk, tbh. For micro company, fusion 360 is probably competitive depending on how much you’re pulling in. But if you’re making $1MM+, the $3k licensing fee for a seat on another platform is more stomachable."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's gonna be pretty hard to talk about the micro when they're dishing out a 2 trillion dollar plan.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Something tells me hedge funds have better tricks up their sleeves than to let it go up another 100%
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You cannot possibly believe that anything in this chart that is more than correlating the stock price with real events is more than reading tea leaves.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Has there been a single chart analysis posted in the past two months that predicted a *decrease* in GME? Super fucking suspect when everything always every time shows a massive increase right around the corner

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technical analysis is already bullshit.

This is bullshit from someone who doesn't even understand the traditional bullshit."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,ohh.. because it has been posted now GME will be trading sideways for another week

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The answer is, nobody fucking knows, if you believe in the stock just shut the fuck up and hold."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA is already comparably as effective as reading tea leaves, but trying to apply it to a stock like GME is especially nonsense. It's silly to think you can meaningfully apply traditional rules or concepts to something that almost exclusively behaves anomalously. 

Also, clickbaity question mark titles instantly make me not trust anything the author has to say."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"In one parallel universe it will for sure go straight up but if it will also go up in this one, I’m not sure... in my personal opinion... it’s a definitely a clear... maybe!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets, Maybe on more bounce
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,100 percent increase still isn't enough for me to break even
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh for fuck sakes guys
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rather than drawing lines on a chart that exists, why not extend those lines and see if the chart ends up where your lines say they be"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m seeing the same.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the fact this guy took the time to read a chart and analyze it but this is literally the worst technical analysis I've ever seen. There are no pattern indicators, there are no volume indicators and I can see at least 3 pattern formations indicating breakouts. I'm not being a hater but as someone who spent a whole year learning technical analysis when trying to learn to day trade, the biggest pattern in that chart is the short wedge formation. Funnily enough, GME acting as an index for WSB stocks: BB, AMC and NOK all had this wedge formation during the same time frame. You can compare the 4 on a monthly 5min and see what I mean. However, they also show a lot of downside from the wedges, particularly if measuring it all against the VWAP, MACD. 

This is why using technical analysis for these stocks creates a bias for long-term forecasts. For these WSB stocks I would rather use fundamental analysis during day. I've found more success by using fundamental analysis because it provides a glimpse into the day to day volume trades of GME.

Not trying to be a hater but slightly objective in hating."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you please ask a 5th grader to draw more random shit on your graph please? Then I might believe you.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably not

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not how this works. Finding one instance where a particular set of prior returns was followed by a 100% stock price increase does not mean anything about performance after seeing another such set of prior returns.

There's less than a 5% probability it will double next week. I can't say what the actual probability is, but it's less than that."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably not

You have none other than ""squoeoze"" and ""cheese wedge"". What makes it a triangle and not lower highs and lower lows. Looks like a bearish reversal to me."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"We all have access to so much technical information now days:  earnings, sales, profits, forecases........... It seems like CNBC likes to talk about that but it's all about Social Media making stocks move.   Let's keep making stock prices eratic"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What percentage of WSB are hedge funds?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"These triangles look different than the last triangle post I saw. I think it could go up or down this time, by a lot or a little, quickly or slowly."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honest question: if we can do this analysis, why wouldn’t supercomputers that manage billions already have done it and traded accordingly? Any reasonable analysis would already be priced in"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This fucking guy can’t even spell within or structure
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Posting something like this should be punished by a legion of midgets jumping out of the bushes to pelt you with bar soap while you're waiting for coffee.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,technical analysis doesnt seem to work very well in such a heavily manipulated market
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chart trading is a bit like astrology to me.

They're so vague, and there are so many god damn triangles, just as a matter of pure statistics, you'll have to be right at some point.

And if you're not, nobody sees it as the real reason anyway and/or cares except the person telling you about it"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thought this was a COVID cases graph at first.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I got lost in burmuda triangle but a bunch of apes pulled me out 🚀🦍
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So what does this mean?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,But!... do we have enough crayons?!

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV is a time traveler. GME hits 1k April 16th.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Tbh I don’t need anymore confirmations. I just HODL.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey im kind of new to all this stuff how can i begin learning about technical analysis?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, those red circles are the only things holding this friggin ship together."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Or a 100% loss. Haha. You neva knows.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,TRIANGLES!!!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,God I hope so. Invested to try and pay off my medical bills and now I just added another 20k of debt from a new AC unit for my house. I need this blastoff already
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So lucky I bought the dip into 120s, that sucker zoomed after that."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you just ignoring that it was the exact same pattern from the 15th to 22nd with no increase?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you guys think hedgies see these analysis too and say this is where we shake the tree? And then short attack at pivotal pattern and technical uptrends, fighting the pattern to screw with us? Simply because people keep posting TA on WSB? lol"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Im really over someone putting something potentially useful up and scrolling through comments for discussion and reading the same stupid fucking ways for everyone to say they dont have a clue what theyre looking at. The jokes about being a retard are stale af. You dont have to type it just cuz you think it. Someone else already has. 4000 times now
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think we should pick on our fellow Ape for doing a technical analysis based on charts. I believe some use them fairly successfully to try and anticipate moves in the market. With that said (And I’m far from any kind of an expert) I don’t think this type of analysis applies to GME. I think it’s obvious GME is not following any normal market patterns. Even if you look at the Volkswagen squeeze in 2008, no one anticipated it. It was just a set of events that got set in motion because the heggies were asleep behind the wheel. The SI wasn’t even that high (something like 12%) however they over estimated the amount of available shares. As it turned out, I think there was something like less than 5%. A well timed statement from Porsche triggered a mass exit of short positions and BAM! I’m not saying I think it will be excactly like that, but maybe something similar. As massive excess of SI compared to actual available shares, and the SOME catalyst. Could come from the DTCC moves, could come from something we can’t even foresee. Either way I believe we are doing the right thing. Buy (actual shares) and HOLD! From there I think the big boys can handle it. Just strap in and be patient. If you have read all the DD you should be confident at this point. My two cents. Feel free to rip me apart as you all see fit. Ape strong!!!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain this to me please 😅
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Here's the full analysis for those who want to get behind the technicals: [Another 100% increase for the GameStop Stock?](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GME/g7JopbEy-Another-100-increase-for-the-GameStop-Stock/)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP you are actually retarded.

And not in a funny way."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,POSITIONS AND BAN. Mods can you please start banning these people for not posting positions. Really needs to be positions and ban no OR.  If this crayon eater truly believes in their Analysis they should be holding positions.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s ballsy
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did he say: ""Buy and Hold?""

Sorry, I can't read.
Also I am autistic.... and I have autism.
So I won't be able to read your replies."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No. GME has had it fun it’s time for it to be put to sleep.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine believing in this fucking shit for a stock that is, almost by definition, an aberration"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Heavily manipulated stocks don't follow normal TA patterns.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys are buying because of FOMO. Do your own research. I don’t want idiots complaining about their two shares when AMC and GME drop a dollar. 

Understand that prices are high right now. Buy low, Idiots."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Past performance is not indicitive of future perfromance
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will be interesting.  I think everyone knows that DFV's calls are due to expire on the 16th.  I assume he is going to use them.  So, that alone will either stimulate the stock by having an army of apes dumping money into it.  Or the Hedgies will try to push the stock down so DFV loses some money.  Plus he has enough stake himself that just him collecting might move the ticker a little.

I have no idea what will happen but it will be interesting."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,#positions or ban
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another  “GME is going to 4948382 a share next week” post 

I wonder if it’s just karma farming at this point.Doing TA on a stock GME is like trying to predict the weather with the patterns in the stars. Schizoposting at its finest"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely yes. I know how to analyze charts and here we see clearly an accumulation.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ban OP if this doesn’t happen
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you've been watching the only three things that matter in this play, it's not over. Fintel is now reporting 129% institutional ownership of GME after showing 105% all week. 100k shares available to short and AT LEAST 10mil shares sold short.

 We are riding the backs of giants with a grudge. Every time they short, sea mammals buy it up.  That's +/- 40mil shares that need to be bought back. The extra shares that don't exist need to be recovered first just to clear the books. I'm ashamed to say only 85% of my portfolio in GME. Luckily, I'm sure I'll only be paying capital gains tax.

Not advice.

TL;DR: 🚀🚀🚀

Definitely not advice."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope so this retarded 🦍💎👐 hodl 69 @247
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry to say but you guys are living in a fantasy world... Market makers are NEVER gonna let GME run again. All technical data and any other traditional tools of the stock market are out the window when it comes to ANY meme stock. They are watching every move made on reddit as well as stacking the the deck against us in every way billionaires can. You all would do much better focusing on stocks that actually have potential. Millions of dollars were made last week on EEENF with more to come. While you all are focused on meme stocks that are WAY over bought and being manipulated against you.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,GME is dead price has stabilized at around $190 everyone should get out
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll take the under
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Prob not tbh
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they'll try to short the fuck out of it before the DTCC rules get fully implemented.

Try to scare us off again.

I've got $5k lined up to buy more stonks if the price gets anywhere near below $150"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, we won't.

See this? This is me managing my expectations.

Don't misunderstand - I'll be absolutely giddy to and foaming at the mouth to be wrong if it does, but it won't."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Or 50% decrease

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"More triangles, my confirmation bias will be 100% guarantee."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short interest is way below 100% so, as of right now, no.  Quarter two may be a bad one."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,ToO ThEe MoOn... LaMbo
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,All TA posts should have a wager attached to them. If you want to draw lines and call it analysis at least put a pee martini on the line. Getting very tired of these posts.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’ll be $45 by the end of the week.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,A squeeze has nothing to do with technical analysis.you either believe in a squeeze or you believe it’s over and the Stock Is moved by normal trading action.you can’t mix both things.every 3 day new triangles

Only people on WSB like GameStop. If you had enough time you could probably count them all.

Forget all that though & hear this: *as long as the buying demand pressure we keep seeing in GME maintains, a price up is all but guaranteed*

Not hating on GME.. good for you guys but rolling out “technical” DD in a stock that trades at basically infinity x earnings is just wasting everyone’s time.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Short answer; no. it will not increase 100%

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I liked the one of the boob. And a sleeping cat
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Too bad TRIX cereal didn’t have green triangles Along with diamond hand horseshoes
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,And pretty colors
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The conjoined triangles of success!

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Triangles so bullish on geometry.  What color of crayon should I eat
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Some hardcore trigono-metry going on here
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Triangles go Brrrrrrr
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Admiring the pattern here, we can see they simply dumped a large amount of shares in order to actually drop the price therefore they can acquire more at the bottom”"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m calling it now. 1000% increase in triangle posts over next 2 weeks.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,best shape

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is consistent with the Magic Triangle Theorem from number theory, which states that any arbitrary math problem can be solved at least in part by drawing a triangle.  The Magic Triangle Theorem is how I passed calculus on my third try back in college."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Strongest shape = Strongest stock!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Strongest shape, i honor thee!"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Much so. I was considering a square and trapezoid but that would be silly. Triangles and lines with a chance of Golden pitchforked reverse trampoline.

I'm sure this makes sense to some autists but I'm a retard and I hold."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right? There was no correlation between previous movements that would dictate a future outcome. 

I'm all for a bit of technical analysis, but there is zero setup here that suggests any confirmed move. Buddy just looking backwards with 20/20 glasses like he's seeing matrix coding now."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, everyone knows these kinds of posts are utter speculative bullshit based on literally nothing right? I hope no one sees the three or four daily posts with a bunch of lines and overlays of other trends and thinks they are actually based on anything real."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe he will read my palm next or perhaps some tea leaves?

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,My tea leaves were shaped like a rocket today. TO THE MOON!!!!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think once its mooned, we should start a campaign to rename Uranus to Myanus, because self deprecating humor is funnier."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"1%? Why put so many 0s past the first decimal?

/s I know why you do it and I think it's stupid. Freaking EUs."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA studies like the ones being used here are typically done on much larger scales using 1Y:1D chart. At minimum an 8 week chart. 

That's not saying that they can still be applied and accurate on shorter term charts - but they become less reliable. 

Besides - since when has anyone that's in on GME trusted TA for their plays?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It's possible that they could be running out of steam though with new rulings and regulations.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,the hedge funds can also participate in the stock going up. it’s not an either/or thing.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Doubt. If they could've gotten out of this mess by now they would've. I imagine they're just hanging on for dear life and giving themselves fat bonuses
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hedge funds aren't the issue now. The issue is Citadel, the market maker. It is in a potentially bankrupted position.

How will it get out of this? It will attempt all of the following:

1) It will break whatever rule is imposed on it and pay whatever that costs down the road. There is no rule they won't break in order to stave off bankruptcy.

2) It will hold the DTCC hostage. It will threaten the entire system in order to stave off its bankruptcy.

And it will likely succeed.

Citadel has the DTCC by the balls at the moment because the DTCC didn't bitchslap Citadel when it could have.

This stock won't be allowed to moon; because doing so ends the game for all players. Things that cannot be allowed to occur won't be."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean yeah this type of technical analysis has long been proven to be pretty well useless.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the reason it works is that everyone reads the same chart, draws the same triangles, and then trades based on those charts.  TA works because people believe it works and then act on it, which makes it work."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"But, these randomly placed triangles seem so convincing this time"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, yes. 19 days ago:

If you observe the price action from the first anomaly and compare it to the one we are currently experiencing, they both exhibit similar behavior. 1st you have a gap up. Then there is the 2nd gap up followed by an exponential explosion. We are currently in the first third of the 2nd gap up. IF price action follows, we should see a slight decline in the price day over day over the next couple of weeks. Will this be enough to squash sentiment? Time will tell. 
I urge others to examine this comparison. Would love feed back. My estimates are using a 5x time stretch and a 2.5(modest) - 2.9x price multiple.

This is a comment from r/options I made."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, people think that if these simple triangles worked, algo traders won't fuck the shit out of it."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know what others are posting but technical analysis works as long as you apply it based on experience and don't overcomplicate the chart with an overload of indicators and theories. 

Here's a previous Tesla Trendanalysis that worked out very well. I don't want to convince anyone to ""believe"" in technical analysis, but there's a reason that this constantly exists throughout the past 30 years. As long as i'm profitable, i'm okay with people downvoting and disagreeing.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was one that popped up last time we spiked to 200 showing a graph and their predictions for 300-500. I swear to God, every single geometric shape, line, and arrow on that chart was pointing at 160.

I think they might have brewed the leaves correctly, but read the signs wrong."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This chart could also be interpreted as a down trend with negative divergence over the week.

Tells us people are willing to buy the dip but not drive the price high. Meaning no momentum"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh yeah, triangles and bull flags/cup and handles etc. can all break downwards if momentum and volume dies off. This is known, we are just predicting the movement not creating it."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh that's just how it's always been with everything
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well thats the thing, for the last few months GME has had a 3 to 1 buy pressure yet it goes down sometimes or rides flat like the last 3 weeks.

There is no right or wrong, even though it's funny to hear this from someone who's learning this for a year. There's a lot more to come

I keep the fundamentals in mind but i personally focus only on risk/reward ratios, fractals and other stuff. The strongest fundamental point for me is a whole subreddit going crazy about a stock for months. That's enough to make money of it, at least for me."

Much more likely is that a bunch of billionaires will try to scare out as much retail as possible so they can drain trillions out of this situation, then phone up Biden for a bailout while they blame a bunch of lazy Millennial Redditors for the entire economy collapsing. Win-win-win-win. All they do is win."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,During the actual squeeze it went from around $20 up to $480 rather quickly. And then back down to $40. Doesn't look like that can happen again since the float is so much less now. Likely will hover around $200 until there is some catalyst for better or worse.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"With a short interest no where near what it was in DEC and JAN, it won't squeeze.

The newbies here are so desperate to make what the actual smart people made on this ticker, they will believe anything to confirm their fantasies."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It went from $2 to $483 in one year. If that wasn’t the squeeze what caused a 20,000% increase ?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Only a few elements of trend analysis work in this case. Volume and moving averages help you to smoothen out volatility and see convergences/ divergences between what the candlesticks are telling and what buyers & sellers actually do with the price.

citadel might be somewhat powerful and may have tried to force a “too big to fail” tag on themselves, but they are a petulant child compared to the DTCC.

some players on the short side will go down, crash and burn style, bear sterns and lehman brothers style. but the majority will survive just fine and some will be better off, like blackrock. 

there are too many paper hands in here and outside to bankrupt the entire market. and even if it came close to that, the US govt would step in with bailouts for the DTCC and some of it’s members."

Well, DFV has to exit his calls position in the next couple of weeks as well.  That might also help squash sentiment when he reveals that they're gone.  Of course, he could execute the calls instead of selling them and double down on the stock, further rallying the troops."

My post wasn't even about technical analysis generally, but rather, how it is done here. Technical analysis can work, but it sure as shit doesn't mean that every example of it is valid. And even when done well, its *extremely* rough, otherwise the patterns would get algorithm'd out of existence. 

And because it is sometimes wrong when done well, and often wrong when inexperienced people use it, I would expect at least some TA for GME to predict price declines at some stage. Either such examples don't get posted because people don't want to discourage potential investors, or it gets downvoted or ignored."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"  No, totally get the trend factors you’ve identified here (which you did a great job at) and it makes the most sense -- but when using trends as indicators (even with fundamentals) you can identify price patterns that form and those trends make a forecast for the overall direction of the stock. Which is the basis for technical analysis. I can see three patterns in GME that form and repeat a couple of times. 

Like I said, I’m not trying to be a hater and get what you’re saying -- backtesting is great, especially if you’re trying to quantify the variables in relation to risk. I use similar strategies as well. Particularly with swings when using momentum. RSI and Chalkin are great indicators for these strategies, they’re fancy because they use moving averages to show the direction of the trend and help limit risk ratios. But what I’m arguing is, these stocks are soo volatile sometimes you can’t gauge the trends. They displace daily even when patterns form. That’s why fundamentals are better for these stocks if you think there’s a bias in the technicals."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What I mean is looking at graphs or any kind of data that traditionally can be used to predict a stocks outcome can't be used on meme stocks. They're totally unpredictable. Especially one as famous as GME. There's manipulation on both sides that aren't normal. But the side the hedge funds and brokers are playing have far more advantages including having market makers that can flood the bid side with 100s or 1000s over and over to drive the price down and prevent it from ever going up. In other words they're not natural orders they're just being inserted in places where there are no natural bids. If people start buying a lot and the price starts to rise they insert these little orders and instantly buy them over and over to drive it back down.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice to know there’s some people with sense watching this happen. I can handle the downvotes but this cult of never being wrong and confirmation bias is just sad.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can’t understand how people don’t recognize that $2 was truly undervalued like DFV said, $483 was the squeeze (or at least the likely high), and the current price that keeps getting circled back to is probably, likely, the correct valuation.

Also, seriously, the people here with all their jokes really underestimate the hedges. There’s no real beating them."

The housing market also crashed after decades of poor decision making and many huge banks getting greedy, which caused the government to step in and stop the bleeding through TARP, where they literally forced solvent banks — private companies — to accept bailout money. Yes, they exerted control over private entities as the government.

I personally don't trade this short squeeze theory, i trade the momentum and back in november it was obvious that masses will hop on the train. This is free money - everything we're seeing now is buyers and sellers pushing the price up and down.
I can tell you that the price won't dip below $80 based on the recent price action - enough buyers will appear way before this.
On the other hand, i can tell you that $500 are out of reach for the next week because there are enough sellers wanting to break even.

Just trade what you actually see and ignore this thoughtful BS. Numbers don't lie, statistics improve you performance. It's as simple as that"

You are claiming to be taking an objective stance while shitting on someone's work for not seeing the same patterns you see or using indicators you favor. Basically your own opinion? Some of the best technical traders I know keep it very simple because at the end of the day it should be used to manage your own risk only. Saying that you have nailed it in a year, your view, and indicators are better than his really shows your immaturity in ""charting"". And in my opinion, GME price action has strayed far away from fundamentals and has to do a lot with option vol. I'm unclear to see how using fundamental analysis is helping you gauge day to day movements that sometimes range between 20-40%. Post earnings, what fundamental changes  of GME explained its quick 30% decline then an even stronger bounce the day following?"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Common misconception. It's love Triangle by the B-3's
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Well fuck. Imma b singing love shack all day now. Damn.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,With 10k i bought at 4. Sold at 7. Mega facepalm.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You retards are the most awesome. Congrats! 🍾
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought this stock at $270 for the loss porn
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,i bought this stock at 234 cuz i like banana
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too except at 325
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought this stock at 192$ based on not know what I’m doing.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,And who will ask them? And on what basis will they halt the trade?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm exaggerating to make a point. My own sell targets are all over the place, lowest one being around 1.2k"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Like they get a fucking choice lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets, it only goes up or down or neither.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Those are coincidences. If it doesn't provide actionable information on a standalone basis then it doesn't magically become useful when you pair it with fundamentals. If those trades were to have gone the other way you would have come up from some excuse for why your TA was off or that you just saw the wrong indicators. There is a reason the vast majority of Wallstreet doesn't use TA and why the first thing you learn in any reputable portfolio theory class that TA is bullshit.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost certainly they have already found a way around all,of that.."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree but at the same time, there has to be a reason for this thing to be sitting at 200 still, and its not from retail traders holding. The way gme bounced back from that slide after earnings tells me something is coming. I hope lol"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"DTCC rulings:

https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings

The most recent ones were:


- 3 different amendments to the ""wills"" of the different arms of the DTCC


- the requirement of members to disclose their positions daily instead of monthly


- increased supplemental liquidity deposit requirements at end of day, which means ""pay up or else"" in the event of a margin call


- most recent and important: locking up share rehypothecation and option trickery to hide fail to deliver situations and short interest. Share is borrowed once, cannot be borrowed again, end of story.


If this is all a coincidence, it sure is a mighty fucking coincidence, don't you think?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree. I don't read legal speak much, but all I've seen is documents that say ""the sec/bank/lender whoever *MAY* do XXXXXX"". Given the way the market seems to work from my layman's perspective may means won't ever do this thing. Additionally, regarding reporting, they removed the monthly reporting requirements, yet everyone seems to think that now they have to report daily.... How does a loosening of regulation make them think that things will be tougher for hedge funds and others?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I have read that yes they have to report positions for the end of 1 quarter but it will only be sent 45 days after the end of the 1 quarter. It varies from the amount of money the HFs have though
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,">and not once have I seen a single click link to an actual report that we can get our slimy retail fingers on.

It's because the actual reports don't confirm WSB's propaganda/conspiracy theory, so it must therefore be a lie.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

The officially reported numbers as of 3/15 indicate 10.19 million shares short, \~45 million shares float, \~70 million total shares outstanding.  This gives us a short float % of about 45% which is still very, very high, but nowhere close to the eye-popping 140% short interest we saw a few months ago.

Nobody can predict the future for certain, but I am guessing that $200 GME *is* the short squeeze.  I do not think that $1000 GME is realistic.  I will be happy to be proven wrong, though."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m getting confused now...! Yes, there are shares for the HFs to buy, but they ‘borrowed’ them at a lower price, in the hope that they would go even lower. To buy them now in order to return the borrowed share, would be to lock in their loss. IMO, and what do I know, it would be cheaper for them to do that at this level than later on. But maybe they just hate to admit losing?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyone can purchase shares of GME and it is a guarantee that any new shares purchased are synthetic or hypothecated shares. The difference is that when you buy a share of GME, you own that share and have entitlement to sell it at FMV. People who are/were short GME, however, have to return the shares they are short. The general consensus is that they are still short more shares than currently exist - even newly hypothecated shares. 

To give a simpler example, they are simply using a credit card to pay off a credit card balance. This does not eliminate the obligation to pay, it just extends the deadline."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Factor in this - retail and other inst are controlling the float pretty much and since HFs proxy shorted GME over ETFs, that means shares trading > shares existing. And still they need to rebuy 100%+ of the float. How if they can't return the synthetic shares? Haha, good question there.

Maybe nicely ask the apes what their price would be? And also you can go different route that involves regulators and erm - creative redistribution of wealth from HFs to the pockets of said party. The American way."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was gambling on a much smaller cap stock for weeks that was the most shorted ticker with the smallest float ( per my research using finviz) . Red candle. Matching green. Green candle. Matching red etc over and over. In the last hour before the merger that pulls their ticker comes a abosulte short shit storm. Where did the shares come from? Some billionares ass I guess. Point is...they dont ever ""run out of shares"" I guess. But Im no expert Im a gambler."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They get to cut the line in front of us on buying shares.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The real shares are drying up, everything else is synthetic. Several brokerages already warn their gme buyers there could be liquidity problems regarding GME shares due to scarcity"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol yeah the new generation of ignore every data point and scream hold over and over and over hoping a squeeze happens a second time 😂😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's my guess. If he exercises, and keeps the stock through the one-year anniversary of buying the apr 16 options, then he pays long term capital gains tax instead of short term. Basically 20% vs 40%

I'd certainly exercise them on that basis alone

Edit: see u/poopyfist reply below. My understanding was incorrect. You must own the stock for a year after exercising.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's scary to think that if he exists, the morale will decrease."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Theres a decent chance he will excersise at least some of them... he has 11m in cash in that screenshot as well
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So do you think we also wont have a repeat of the share recall like in April of last year?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hope you did not take my comment as kind of an argument of sorts to your post. Just that I have seen others trying to speculate when and how it is going to move. I like how you have shown it and agree with what it looks like and I hope you are right in the end. To be honest. I am ready for the ride to be over. Everyday when I look at other tickers or the market as a whole, I feel like this one is messing things up. DD is not doing me any good with my other prospects and I feel it's hinging on one. Things go up and things go down, but some are going down or holding steady when they should be going up. I know the system is big and the money involved is bigger. Hopefully "" the tendyman"" comes soon and things can settle back into that pattern driven masterpiece that is the market we love. Appreciate your DD and await the results. Until then I guess we watch the in-flight movie, eat some complimentary bananas (and various candy), and wait for the moon to appear outside the window."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If TA was a reliable indicator then there is zero reason for a human to be in the loop. You could automate every single trade using the same lines you drew on the graph and make billions and billions a day. 

Instead, it’s a coin flip.

Hell, your candles don’t even touch a lot of your lines, you keep moving the lines as the chart moves over time which by itself is an indicator it’s bullshit. Just rewriting things to fit a narrative, with the theory it’ll trade between $500 and $80. I could guess that range too based on literally nothing. It’s done that for weeks."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"When did I say I nailed technical analysis in a year? I stated I spent a year learning technical analysis. And what technical traders do you know? By stating you think technical analysis should simplified, is arbitrary to the definition of technical, technical analysis is used to analyze price patterns from trends and forecast buying and selling opportunities. Using indicators like the MACD (to help you understand MACD= moving average convergence divergence) help with those forecasts and were created by quants using technical analysis. Day to day volume, is apart of fundamental analysis? A little confused as to why you think it's not apart of fundamental analysis??? No offense --  it sounds like you need to sit down and maybe learn the stock market before you make statements that aren't accurate."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s morning for me 🤷‍♂️ you gme cult members are pretty funny tho. Too bad y’all banned the guythat did steel DD from wsb months ago I’ve made huge gains from it

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey you can always buy back in brother the expensive shares are fineeeee. Just ask me and my shares at $105
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You had over 1000 chances to get back in below 20, which would have given you between a quarter and a half a million.  You’re retarded, good place for you to be"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Much better than buying a stock at $2 .. selling at $1.60 .. checking it 6 months later and seeing it at $30 .. go long alcohol in this case.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If it makes you feel better I sold a black lotus for $20 and Moxes at $15 each when MTG came out. I made a decent amount of money off that game but would be rich today if I held.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You made a lot more than Melvin did!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,this makes me feel better about buying PLTR at 13 and selling at 20 on the way up
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re not retards...they’re just lazy people wanting another gift from the money gods when they already had it. The short squeeze party is over.  I sold mine on the first go at $350. Waiting for it to happen again is lazy wishful thinking not retarded. If I had a choice between being lazy or retarded  I'd choose retarded everytime.

And you're asking me what basis will they halt the trade???
Who f****** knows.. they got the power they'll make up some reasons ..they do it with all kinds of stocks.. shoot now and ask questions later basically..
But realistically they will halt the trade because the numbers don't add up. They said it before.. I repeat..they outright came and said it before!! people just ignore that"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh.... You realize that any kind of analysis when it comes to price movement, volume, etc is TA? Claiming that wallstreet doesn't use TA is just plain wrong man. I'm not saying that TA is the only thing you should use when making trading decisions, but if you're not at least looking at the charts and historical information then you're not too bright."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"They still have to actually pass those rules. That hasn’t happened yet, and probably won’t for a couple weeks."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the rule applies to GME, how about Tesla? The shorts love to F@*k with it for years now."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they don’t want to admit defeat and they are also very full of themselves. They looked at WSB Apes and said we can outlast these guys. Little did they know, when we said diamond hands we meant it and I know that HF did not (and maybe still do not) respect that at all. They won’t exit because they would rather watch the greater economy crash and burn than lose money off a greed bet in public."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"""as someone who spent a whole year learning technical analysis"" makes it sound like you think you are an expert when it only highlights your infancy. Technical analysis can be as complicated or as simplified as someone wants it to be. What works for them, might not work for you. The whole point here is that it is stupid to call someone else's TA bad just because it's not fitting your own narrative. Then calling your own narrative OBJECTIVE? Remember you are the one bagging on someone for not using certain indicators or patterns not me. By all means use MACD if it works for you, but that doesn't mean his is bad for not using any of your indicators. You're missing the whole reason of why I commented and instead trying to force down more indicators LOL. Volume analysis is more technical analysis than fundamental analysis which is more towards looking at company fundamentals. If you don't even know the difference between technical and fundamental analysis please don't tell me to learn the stock market. I won't reply to this anymore because it's not worth talking to someone who is arrogant. 😂"

For DFV feels no FUD at all and I’m just as confident as him idk when he’ll sell but it makes sense to sell around the top of the mountain which we are only a few climbs into.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"They said what before? ""If GME get anywhere near 100k we will halt the trade?"".  When have they said ANYTHING about this?  Edit: I don't really think it's going to 100k, but I can see it going to 2k-5k pretty easily. Tesla literally did the same exact thing last year."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,100k is unlikely but how likely is 10k? 8k?? What about 5k? Gains are gains and I know I can gain on this stock both short and long term. Now get off the stageeee
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Equity analysts like the CFRA make technical reports becsuse they sell them to the public and generate revenue. They don't guide their investment decisions and you could literally bet against the CFRAS reports and make more money than you would if you followed them because their reported accuracy is often below 50%. Looking at historical price returns and volatility isn't exactly TA. Making inferences and predictions based off of recent trends is.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. No timeframes. But assuming they were passed to minimize fallout in the case of short defaults, this means that the DTCC sees risk in the future. I doubt they'd pass this many rules after so many years of allowing the system to stand as is if they did not anticipate risk to themselves."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What are a couple weeks compared to the months of holding we already have under our belts though? Literal water under the bridge
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tried to do a DD breaking down the timing and a couple Apes commented with better understanding of the legalese than I had. It appears the type of amendments being made allowed the DTCC to make effective immediately upon filing, but there is a window for comment or potential for suspension of the new rule if there is objection by the SEC or sufficient comment to the DTCC to have revision. They specify within 45 days, or up to 90 if deemed necessary"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"They should (keyword should) apply to everyone. Tesla doesn't have as many rehypothecated shares, to my knowledge, so it should be less impactful on their stock, but who knows if there are short positions hiding in the bushes."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"They don't have to diclose those positions to *us*. It's not public. They only have to diclose those positions to the DTCC, which can then go ""oh fuck no"", and force them to either unwind the positions or cough up cash. If they can't do either, liquidation. All of this happens behind the scenes. Some of those rules are still not in effect, also, so patience is key."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so they are on the hook, and everyone agrees that the hedge funds have WAAAAY over extended themselves right? So if the DTCC makes a move to force them to cover they will be left owing massive money right? So why would the DTCC do something that would fuck themselves over? Why do anything when they could do nothing and let the current game continue?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,With a side of ghost fries
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That sounds about right. I guess they are so used to crashing the price and panicking people to sell, that it must be puzzling to them that we are seeing their efforts as buying opportunities. Bullying tactics no longer working. I think you’re right, they would rather bring the house down than make a loss. Not good people."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,">I think they don’t want to admit defeat

Allowing defeat to happen equals a business ending event for those hedge funds, and a career crippling-or-ending event for their C-levels. Of course they're not going to roll over and accept it, and they'll spend every remaining cent trying to stop it from happening, because taking a loss that can be survived is still better than taking a loss that kills them."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I loved B-1's before anyone knew who they were.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You made 75% profit. 
Trading in hindsight is easy."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What? Did it go that high last time?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pfff I have shares in my RH account that I bought at $300 and I’ve been holding those ever since. Bought more on my fidelity account bc why not. With that said, my hands are so fucking diamond"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla also wasn't sold short nearly to the same extent GME is and with not nearly as many eyes on it, hehehe

This really could be the squeeze to end all squeezes. The DTCC itself wrote into existance rules that forbid assets from being rehypothecated and also forbids options to be used to skirt obligations (fails to deliver), just this week. It could have nothing to do with the GME, but the timing is eerie, especially if you consider all the recent rule changes passed.

I truly believe shit's about to go down, I just don't know when."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude got fucked on 30k of put options and is salty. 💎🙌 🚀🌕
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I see it going 100k simply because of how shorted it is and how much demand there's going to be for it.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Y’all are delusional . It went to $483 in January. It was beautiful. The absolute top....it was glorious selling then. Lives were changed.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not talking about that stuff though - I'm talking about using historical information to help determine trends and price levels which a security will meet significant movement or stagnancy based on multiple factors. Levels of support or resistance, RSI levels, volume, all of these things give you information on when trades were made, how many were made, and for what reasons trades were made. 

That's all valuable information. It doesn't mean that what is predicted to happen will, since there are thousands of variables that impact price action. But that doesn't mean that it's still not an effective tool to help determine the likelihood of a price movement."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Because the longer they wait the more money they owe. They didn't revise their rules on how to survive as a company in case of a defaulting member causes complete liquidation for nothing.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I like to think of it as trying to call their bluff and hold them accountable. It’s a dangerous game because the price could drop and never come back and you’re left with bags but every time it goes down I remember that citadel and HF are just selling shares back and forth to drop the price down. Then upward pressure picks it back up. There was upward pressure like this back when we were at $40 in early February. I’m an optimist here but I do think she’s set to bust out in the next few weeks and increase. Then again I am just a diamond handed gorilla
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Underwater.  As in short and paying more interest on their position than they stand to make. 

Given that there are shares to be bought without restriction right now, and the last 20 days alone have seen average daily volumes of 20 million shares...why on earth would you think that anyone desperate to close their position because they’re deep underwater, hasn’t done so already?

Yes there’s a ton of short interest now.  Because everyone expects this stock to be worth less in a year than it is now.  

I have a hard time buying into the “squeeze hasn’t squoze” mentality when there are tens of millions of shares moving every day...

I honestly think at this point it’s HFs buying shares to trigger mass buying, convincing retail that “the squeeze is on!!!”, watching retail drive up the stock price, and then selling said shares all at once to trap retail..."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why will they be the biggest gaming company in the world? I don’t even think they can overtake Best Buy.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,lol fair argument.. flair me then pls: Technoking of Karen’s
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit’s GME moonbois. I think that much was obvious.

I mean look at you, literally claiming the floor is $1,000,000. It’s such easy money why isn’t everyone just buying one share????"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't make you an expert so why did you feel like one to shit on someone else's analysis?

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They are the bomb!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"They were talking about the price of the call option, not the underlying. And in that case, yes it most definitely did."

Although the buying part would’ve been fucking tits."

DD has been bullish AF so far, I have no regrets buying the dips."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It won't be long. It might have another dip for a couple week, but once it bounces and gets into 300s a LOT of eyes are going to be on it."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Youre even admitting that its not reliable and requires accepting low effective likelihoods of price movement.

Bro if your predictions cannot be made reliably and the likelihood of success is, on average, below 50%, then your method is useless and provides no meaningful information lmao.

Successful day traders are better marketers than they are traders (which is why people think TA works), and no one ever talks about the exponentially greater amount of day traders who lost everything."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The really great thing about this situation, is that apes would be well placed if GS was its old, mediocre self, and there was nothing but the short situation. However, with RC turning GS around, the shares look set to increase (IMO) anyway. The next twist of pain for the hedges might be the new board members being announced. Who knows, might even prompt non ape investors to come along."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think on the current fundamentals and direction the company is going, company could hit 500+ without a squeeze.

Current price at an absolute minimum if the new GameStop is poorly executed.

Squeeze is just potential juice on the salmon, I like the stock.

On top of that been making bank options trading."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Same day delivery was huge. Public sentiment is huger.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Best Buy isn’t a gaming company though. They are an electronic goods store that happens to sell gaming items. The shift in GameStop to selling PC components will fill that difference in stock between BB and GME went it comes to gaming. If some of the rumors about GME getting into eSports with that whole 🐸 🍦 thing a few weeks ago, then they would be well poised to be the premiere gaming shop. The AWS hires and other rumblings about cloud infrastructure also hint that way as well."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Listen man, the facts say it's possible. Say it's delusional, isn't going to happen etc etc, but if you don't have counter DD, then you're just wasting everyones time.

Put up facts, thats what traders work off of."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope not so obvious.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I was under the impression it all had to stay in the Roth.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, so a person who's not an expert, telling another expert that they're not an expert, yet doesn't understand volume is a part of fundamentals of the technicals in charting.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you smoking crack? This is gamestop were talking about, no one above the age of 12 has had any reason to go there for years..."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"When did I ever say that likelihood is below 50%? Or that it requires accepting low effective likelihoods?

Don't put words in my mouth. 

TA isn't the end all be all. Everyone knows that. TA just allows you a small amount of confidence that something is more likely than not to happen. It could add 1% of confidence in a movement (51/49) or it could add 10% (60/40), that's all up to the analyst to determine how confident he is in the research and analysis they have applied to the prediction. 

It's no different than what vegas odds makers do using historical information and performance of players and teams to determine spreads and lines. It gives them a little information to help determine an attractive starting position to get bets. That line may move a ton depending on things not even related to that analysis they used initially (amount of money on either side of the bet) or it could move a ton based on new information (injuries, etc). It's the same exact kind of thing as TA - it just provides a bit of insight that's used as PART of the decision making process."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The DD that claims the DTCC insurance policy will bail out trillions in losses and funnel the money into the hands of retail investors while destabilizing the entire market? You want me to tell you why that DD is retarded?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You think the floor is $1m. We used to make fun of people like you here, the real retards. 

This sub sucks now. You are so dumb you couldn’t use context clues to figure out which redditors I was talking about."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Naw. You can take out any principal that you've deposited at any time without penalty.

If you take growth out early (currently before 59 1/2) you have to pay a penalty and income tax"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fundamental analysis becomes fundamentals of technicals in charting 😂 so technical analysis, no words for that twist of words from the original post and attempted recovery. You still don't get the point how TA in general is based on one's perspective so how can you try to shit on someone else's. Notice that I am not even criticizing your own points or methodology for GME. It is just wrong to think that your view is objective and his is subjective yet all you can argue is that ""I am retarded"". Can you explain why your view is the objective one vs his is the subjective or will this back and forth just be you insulting?"

You def don’t want to wait until expiration for sure on the further out the money plays. Def hold the $690 and $700 and every other contract closer in the money. Honestly it might barely get to $700 this coming week. You don’t want that time depreciation eating away at your contracts value. I don’t think there’s any big news this week for Tesla besides other companies having rebounds this week and the coming week in a similar sector such as (BLNK) after earnings. Not the greatest earnings, but it rebounding after sell off. Tesla isn’t moving like it used to."

2021-04-02 20:28:41,wallstreetbets,"MicroVision Investment Thesis and Summary of DD and compelling events MicroVision (MVIS) Investment Thesis

Disclaimer: I am not a financial or investment advisor.

Disclaimer: This is a monster stock.

Note: I have attempted to pull together the business case and investment thesis and summary of recent compelling events based on the work of many in the MicroVision community r/MVIS, including u/S2upid and u/BigBlackWifey to name a few, with the intent of spreading the word about this great company with massive potential.

Many of you may have first heard about MicroVision due to the recent news of the $21.9B US military contract awarded to Microsoft for over 120,000 IVAS/HoloLens 2 headsets over the next 10 years. 

This is significant for MicroVision because their tech is in these headsets. We know this because the now legendary Hololens 2 tear down by u/S2upid:[S2upid Hololens 2 Teardown](https://tinyurl.com/S2upidHololens2Teardown)

This is why MVIS spiked 50% following the news.

Full article: [Microsoft Wins US Army Contract](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html) 

This deal will surely lead to an significant increase in MicroVision’s AR vertical revenue, however, the military contract is just the tip of the iceberg...

The big PR that everyone has been waiting for has yet to drop... MicroVision has best-in-class 4D LiDAR for with technical specs and price per unit meeting or exceeding OEM autonomous driving requirements.
The company has announced at the last EC that the LiDAR A-Sample will be complete in April 21, and all signs point to a buyout already being negotiated with Google for the Auto Lidar vertical and possibly Microsoft for the AR divisions... there could be a bidding war soon unless a deal has already been inked.

(1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 apply to MicroVision)

Nobody is defending the price. (Sign #1)

Wild fluctuations in the stock price (Sign #3)

Large amounts of phantom premium on the table (Sign #4)

Unusual Options activity (Sign #5)

More and MORE FUD across all platforms. (Sign #6)

The only real argument is that we don’t have a working product that anyone has seen and very little revenue.

That’s about to change... (See $22B Microsoft US Military IVAS contract and upcoming auto LiDAR A-Sample)

Naked shorts and MM’s are driving the pps down. Bizarre price action prior to upcoming milestones.  (Sign #7)

Let’s connect some dots...

Summary of the recent compelling events:

Note: Some of the below DD based on summary from u/t-jameson-corazon 

Feb, 2020 - CEO Sumit Sharma takes the reins. Sumit used to be Director of Google Glass. 

June, 2020 - Dr Mark Spitzer joins the BoD. Spitzer has ties to Google.  Dr Spitzer is the leading AR expert in the world and came out of retirement to be a part of MicroVision’s journey.

Q3 2020 - Ford announced a stake in Velodyne (VLDR), a competitor in automotive LiDAR.

Dec, 2020 - Judy Curran (Ford) joins the Microvision BoD.

Judy Curran previously held executive positions at Ford Motor Co. She has more than 30 years of experience in vehicle program, engineering, and technology leadership. Judy Curran is very pragmatic and would not join the board of a failing company. Curran currently serves as Head of Global Automotive Strategy at ANSYS, a developer of multiphysics engineering simulation software. ANSYS could conduct testing for interested parties to have benchmark data.

Ford and Google have a strategic partnership.

2/1/21 - State of Michigan has purchased 1 Million shares of MVIS (not $1 million worth of MVIS, 1 Million SHARES).

Ford is based in Michigan.

2/5/21 - Blackrock buys 2.4 million SHARES.

Mid-Feb 21 - Ford sold its position in VLDR.

Feb 16th 21, MVIS announces a $50M ATM offering agreement with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. This ATM gave MicroVision the Net Working Capital (NWC) needed to facilitate a Merger and Acquision. This was filed with the SEC in a way that allows MVIS to pay fees based on the current share price and not disclose the future share price (Sign of incoming buyout - This is BAFF (Bullish as Fucking Fuck).

March 2nd, 21’ - BoD Bernee D. L. Strom steps down to make room for the newest board member, Seval Oz. (Sign #8)

Seval Oz, the newest BoD, is a recognized global business and marketing leader in mobility, autonomous vehicle technology and intelligent transportation systems. 

Oz was a Founder and CEO of Aurima, Inc, a multi-sensor awareness platform powered by AI deep learning for autonomous vehicles. She was previously CEO of Continental Intelligent Transportation Systems, a division of Continental AG Interiors Division. She has served as Head of Global Strategic Partnerships for Google[x]'s Self Driving Cars Program (Waymo) where she supported global business and marketing efforts for Google’s self-driving technology commercial launch. In addition, she is an executive board advisor to automotive industry leaders and an investment advisor to several investment funds and holds 10 patents in vehicular technology software.  

Seval Oz - “I am thrilled to join the MicroVision board of directors at this opportune time. I am excited to bring my expertise and experience in autonomous vehicle technology and mobility to the Company as it develops its automotive LiDAR technology and explores strategic alternatives.”

Seval Oz has been on the board for the last month and has not filed a Form 3 or 4 with the SEC yet. Seval Oz would not just join the board of a failing company, and she certainly would not join the board without compensation. The only logical reason for her not filing a Form 3 or 4 with the SEC already is if she is being compensated by the acquiring company (Google). This is BAFF.

Several BoD’s have stepped down in recent months (to make room for the new appointees) and have not sold their stock. (Sign #8)

Sumit has repeatedly stated he is interested in exploring strategic alternatives including the sale of a vertical or multiple verticals. 

Direct quotes from the earnings call on March 11 with [transcript](https://tinyurl.com/ECTranscript):

“The ability to deliver a high performing long range Lidar sensor that is designed to meet or exceed current OEM requirements”

“The scalability of our sensor to meet future price targets”

“I believe that adding these new expertise and insight to our current board, to augment existing expertise in business, including expertise in mergers and acquisition, strengthens our ability to create value for our shareholders”

“We’ve pioneered scalable solutions that we believe are far ahead of global competitors”

“The impact and value of what we’ve achieved was hard to measure (insert SS chuckle) since there were no competitive solutions for these verticals”

“Our automotive Lidar product addresses an emerging market segment that has the potential to impact millions of lives, in mobility and safety, with potentially billions of dollars in sensor and ? sales for OEM’s, and multi national technology companies over coming decades”

“With such capabilities, in our first potential product, we believe a future product could then include a Lidar, and a camera module, combined in a single sensor”

“As I mentioned in our call last October, regarding our A sample timing, we expect the hardware for demonstration, along with select benchmark data from our development platform, will be available to interested parties, in our April timeframe, followed by complete benchmarking and testing. I also expect that a version of our solid state long range Lidar sensor could be available for sale, in small quantities, in Q3 or Q4 this year”

“Our solid state long range Lidar sensor could enable any interested parties to perform testing, with our sensor, on their platforms, such as cars, and long haul trucks”

“We expect to establish a pilot line with appropriate capacity to demonstrate scalability as we have done over the last decade for multi technology national partners. Let me be specific on this. Our capabilities include delivering ? maps, control plans, supply chain partnerships, automation, and product integrity qualification, for high yield design, that can ramp”

“In conclusion, we remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the company, in part or whole, to maximize value for our shareholders”

“I am profoundly optimistic”

“During the year ending Dec 21st 2020 we applied a total of 2 million dollars against the prepayment”

“We anticipate the financial statements that we will be releasing shortly, will no longer have a going concern opinion” (have since been released)

“On our April 2017 customer, we are expecting that royalties in 2021 will increase over 2020, and we’re rooting for that product to do well” (note April 2017 customer is Microsoft (22 Billion doable contract awarded last week)

“We are a stand alone company right now, but we’re up for sale”

“I’m always optimistic about the company. A year ago, where we were, people asked, what do you think, you know (insert SS chuckle) Microsvision, you know, even back then, I think it’s worth billions”

“I’m trying to draw the bigger picture of how important it is to actually solve these problems in these segments”

“I want to be very crystal about what we’re working on, and our commitment to strategic alternatives”

“If you solve a key problem, and your extremely valuable, of course I’m optimistic about the company. Hugely optimistic about what it can enable”

“The demonstration would be for potential customers or other interested parties. It’s not a public demonstration per se, but for folks that were in conversation with”

“This is a fight for the future. The last time I remember feeling this kind of excitement was what we call the internet age in the late 90’s, mid 90’s, where we knew that there was a big revolution that would impact everyone’s life, so I’m excited. All of us are”

“This is benchmarking data that is provided for interested parties”

“Everybody’s thirst for data, will be done, who is working with us under NDA”

“...we need to give confidence to customers, people, you know, perhaps in a strategic transaction”

“Save millions of lives, and make billions of dollars over decades”

“The process continues, but we will not be commenting on any specifics”

Short Squeeze coming...
There is significant short interest against MVIS, in fact several short firms have been very vocal about being short on MVIS. Based purely on the P/E ratio, it would seem that shorting would be a good strategy, however, MVIS value is not in the current earnings, it is in the IP of the LiDAR and AR tech, and upcoming buyout.

Look at the short interest, borrowed shares and float. The shorts are all-in and there is about to be a massive short squeeze...

From a TA perspective, we are seeing bullish divergence on the weekly chart. We are making higher lows on the weekly and lower lows on the RSI. This is bullish divergence, a sign that another breakout is coming soon... We are also about to see a Golden Cross on both the MVIS chart and the Nasdaq, another sign pointing to an upcoming breakout... the shorts will be forced to cover soon, which will cause a short squeeze. Wait until the A-Sample PR drops... let alone the buyout PR...

Samuel Kang, head of total solutions North America for BYD says last week, “we believe in mvis” and comments after, “they have better tech then Luminar.”

MVIS is considered a Mid-Cap stock since its market cap is over $2B. This has let to a further increase in institutional ownership.

Competitors:
Luminar (LAZR) LiDAR is currently valued at $8B, they were $10B prior to the tech correction, and MVIS LiDAR is superior in terms is specs, size, and scalability. Therefore, we can estimate the fair market value of MVIS auto LiDAR vertical being at least equivalent to LAZR at $8-10B ($51-$63.50/share). I personally think MVIS LiDAR should garner more since it is superior to LAZR, so I am estimating $75-100 pps for the Auto LiDAR vertical. That is not even mentioning the value of the Consumer LiDAR and AR verticals. MVIS has a portfolio of over 460 patents. My price target for the entire company is at least $150/share.

AEVA is the new kid on the block, recently went public via SPAC. Founded by ex-Apple guys, so they have generated some buzz snd have a current market cap of $2.6B. AEVA also has 4D LiDAR, their tech is based on a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) system that integrates onto a chip. Our key advantage over AEVA is timing and speed to market. AEVA has announced they will not be ready for production until late 2023/early 2024. MVIS has comparable if not superior technical specs and has a 3 year head start on AEVA... 3 years...

MicroVision regarding their LiDAR:
“We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have a range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any LiDAR with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters, 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters, and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters. This equates to 520 points per square degree.”

I have been holding and accumulating since May 2020.

I emptied my bank account (again) last week.

I currently hold 10,000 shares in my ROTH and 3,300 shares in brokerage along with 93 calls/LEAPS.

This is a YOLO for me as I have 95% of my folio in MVIS.

I don’t want to regret not buying more pre-buyout.

This is the way."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't help but laugh at all the support for MVIS on this board now. We tried to tell you all when it was $2 and got spit on
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Honey, why did you invest all of our savings in this stock?”

“It was a calculated move based on the analysis of BigBlackWifey, relax.”"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Been in here with 25k shares at sub 30 cents. When I said something about Mvis before on here I got railed by the community. Now Whatsup bitches!!!! Even tho I sold 20k shares at $9 I’m still holding 5k. Fuck you retards.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"As noted on a post in r/MVIS in March, the fact that Seval Oz hasn't filed the forms could be very telling to a very quick buyout coming.  Also with her ties to Google and her automotive experience this makes me very suspicious that Google and a top tier automaker will be coordinating their efforts for purchase.  


My guess for top three potential suitors buyout is now: Google/Automaker, Google, Apple, with Microsoft in fourth.  They really should have bought the company already though.  I feel MSFT has missed their chance in purchasing at the great value they could have had in 2019 or 2020."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,When we look back in 5 years and this technology is in every car and in every home and in everyone’s glasses we are going to laugh at how smart we were for investing in world changing tech. Sorry to anyone that’s going to miss to MVIS train!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Target is 45,000 shares by June. Hoping my 650 April and May calls can get me there when I sell em.

And yes, 100% mvis till buyout."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"All that writing and no emojis???

I'm so in"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s also worth noting that in the very near term this could have a decent short squeeze (not GME like) but a good one none the less. The 50% run the other day showed no short shares returned on that run and they actually kept shorting it. They used up all but a few thousand available shares to push it down on Thursday according to Iborrowdesk. Last time it went from $6-$24 it was nowhere near this shorted, it could easily 3+x very quickly if we can pressure the shorts to cover. If we can push it to $20 it will be a very violent move higher from there"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I say this made my pp hard, I mean like rock solid. I have 1,095 shares at 16.71. If this goes to $75 pps I think my pp will grow a pp."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,4k shares deep already. Buying calls Monday.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"First off, thank you for the extensive write-up!  Bought a small position earlier this year and have been buying the dips ever since.  Up to \~4,000 shares and a few calls.  Can't imagine what it feels like to have 10s of thousands of shares at <$5/share like some of the people on the MVIS subreddit.

Thinking of picking up some more calls if there's a big dip next week, or just buying at whatever price on Monday because I feel like a PR drop could come at any day.  You done accumulating for now?"

What to do is what I ask myself."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The fucking premiums on microvision are insane right now.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So the MSFT contract got announced and MVIS jumped 50%. Until today there is no official confirmation that mvis tech is in the hololense. Image what will happen with the stock when they announce a partner or investor. This is some serious mars quality stock!

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not in for much AND I bought a market order which went for ATH price lmao, retarded.

But, even at ath... at conservative estimates on buy out you're still looking at 200-300% gains... that's truly retarded.

Buy at $24/share and sell at $164/share if buy out is in vicinity of $25 billion. That's 680% gain...

I'll believe it when I see it though. Honestly I just like the stock. Best in class lidar has so many applications in Entertainment/Industrial AR/Military/Automotive/Security/Drones...

If they buy-out, that's fine... but if not they'll see their tech everywhere anyways."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you pay cash when you could get a loan for very lower interest rates? You would get better returns in the market

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course! I feel it’s my civic duty to share this story so as many retail traders as possible can benefit. I don’t want it to be just the institutions that benefit from this. That’s great, 4,000 shares and a few calls is a great position. There will always be people with more or less than you, the important thing is not to compare yourself to others, but instead to compare yourself tomorrow to yourself today. Self-improvement is the key to life. In that light, I have continued to add and will continue to add to my position up until the buyout. Why wouldn’t I when I know the company is worth minimum 5-10x+ what it’s trading at today and all signs point to a buyout being announced sooner than later? 

This is the way."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s good. I don’t mind increasing my cost avg. As long as the company is still undervalued, I’m making ROI."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s great! Congrats
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow. What price are you holding until? Though I guess MVIS will most likely be getting acquired for at least $75 per share soon, so it’s a moot point 😋"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did as well. I would not have done this without extensive research and understanding of the company, the technology, the potential fair market value for the verticals, and all of the imminent buyout signs. I am willing to stake my future on this company."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I did this under $2
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do it. I did!

How much OTM?

I went for MVIS 5/21 $18 calls"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great note, added"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just depends on your risk/reward tolerance. You have to make that decision on your own. The more ITM a call option is, the less risk and the less reward. Near ITM and OTM are higher risk/higher reward. Regardless of your risk tolerance, I recommend buying call options when the stock price has hit the long-term support (ie buy low)."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Because everybody knows it's mooning.  Just buy the stocks.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,after MVIS flies
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The chart looks like we are in a consolidation phase for the next few days or week or so. We may consolidate for the next week or two and then breakout again, or we could push through next week on strong volume, sentiment, market conditions, and increasing FOMO. A lot of it depends on if we get temporarily held back by rising bond yields and their impact on the Daq.  Everyday that goes buy is another day close to the expected A-Sample PR, so I expect FOMO to increase as the days go by. It will also be riskier and riskier to short.

Once we close above the key resistance of ~$19.30, we will pull back slightly then we will moon into the Mid-High 20’s... everyone will have the green light and will be loading up at that point. There is barely any resistance after $19.30."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,We like the stock! 💎🙌💎🙌💎
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most of the internal power players already have millions of shares and significant options, so the lack of insider buying doesn’t scare me. If I believed strongly in a counter argument I would not be so heavily invested. If there is a counter argument it would be that there is still risk until the A-Sample demo(s) is/are successful. You could make an argument that AEVA may be a competitor of merit, although I think a 3 year head-start to market is a significant competitive advantage for MVIS, and again, I believe there can be more than one winner in terms of autonomous driving market share. AEVA has not proven they are superior to MVIS. You also need to consider the potential value of the other MVIS divisions and IP patent portfolio. Consumer LiDAR and AR are huge growth spaces and the recent MSFT IVAS US military contract only increases the value of the AR vertical. Connecting all the dots, Seval Oz’s missing Form 3/4, the BoD changeover with autonomous driving power players with deep ties to Google and Ford, the resignation of GC effective June... they way they filed the $50M ATM with the SEC... it sure does seem like a deal is all but done already..."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,All you need to know is 3M in revenues last year.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t think there is a strike available right now that is above what the BO price is going to be but you are right about IV.  Selling your calls on the spike is the best strategy even if they aren’t in the money by some chance.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe try your hand at Walmart then, scared money don’t make money."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look up definition of:
1. Patent moat
2. M&A
3. LiDAR
4. IVAS

It’s like not buying Tesla ~10 years ago (or today). MVIS will be 5x on stocks and 500x on options. Best of luck to you bears."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Remindme! This is going to be like one of the guys who talked crap on DFV LMAO
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Disruptive tech like this is ahead of its time. All of MVIS’s parents are just now becoming extremely value due to emerging markets and the growth in technology
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh so you don’t think a buyout would significantly increase the share price? That’s a bold take considering our next closest competitor Luminar (LAZR) in the automotive LiDAR vertical alone has a market cap of $8B, and our 4D LiDAR is superior to Luminar. If we assume an extremely modest valuation of the auto LiDAR vertical at $10B, and an extremely modest valuation of the consumer LiDAR and AR verticals of $5B, you see looking at a price target of $95.25/share. If you’re only comfortable with a few OTM calls I don’t know if I can reason with you."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on big institutional buying is risky just buy and HODL
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"To my understanding.... The buyout won't be finalized immediately.  The share price will shoot up to probably just under ...5% maybe?... of what the buyout price will be, at which point you can take the substantial profit or buy the shares and wait for the ink to dry on all the contracts and make X% more."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every investment has risk, but based on all of the DD, the company IP, the strategic direction, and the recent compelling events. I’m confident enough that the company is worth minimum 5-10x what it is currently valued at that I have gone all in.  They have best-in-class LiDAR for autonomous driving and massive growth potential in the other verticals. Recommend you check out the deep dive link at the bottom of my post, that should answer all of your remaining questions."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"3M in revenues and the company is valued at 2bn.
There are hot dog stands in Central Park that make more annual revenues.

The play is for a buy out due to the technology. 

It may happen or not but this company has never made more than $20M in a year and has been in existence over 7 years. It needs a buy out. 

If the buy out happens those who bought in under low will be making tendies."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if they have decent resolution up to that range, (Microvision lists 250M as their range because they still have excellent resolution at that distance, but it can technically see farther too) how much does that benefit self driving? How far ahead do we look in city driving? Maybe 20-50 yards most of the time because all the traffic and pedestrians are closer than that and we’re going at slow speeds. On the highway at 80mph average braking distance is about 100 meters, so over doubling that seems plenty adequate. Diminishing returns on distance seen over 200 meters IMO."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The deep dive link has a lot of good competitor analysis info, including comparing MVIS to Luminar."

Is the idea that a buyout announcement will rocket the stock price higher and you sell the leaps?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You sell to the shorts that are scrambling to cover on the way up. We could see a nice squeeze above the buyout price.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Better off to lock in the loan for all time low rates and save the capital in some sort of safer investment IMHO. Save that powder for something better (investment real estate for example).
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really, shares would spike in anticipation of a special dividend, causing options premium to increase relative to the delta. Kind of a similar situation to how sometimes shares get called away for slightly OTM CC’s when underlying goes ex dividend."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The price of the call contracts would definitely reflect the special dividend as the share price of the stock would grow after the announcement of the dividend. 

So you could sell the options contracts based on the climb in intrinsic value as a result, or just execute the options and hold the underlying shares if you want to capture the special dividend that way."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No confirmation of timing for a buyout announcement, though I do think we’re poised for another breakout in the next few weeks due to bullish pattern forming on the charts and fomo increasing every day. There are a few different ways to play it depending on your risk tolerance. There is always inherently more risk with options than stock. Less risky are DITM calls, but also bigger premiums. OTM April/May calls are high risk/reward. LEAPS are less risky due to the extrinsic value.  Your call."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Shareholders would need to vote. CEO has been trustworthy and is constantly working on increasing shareholder value.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fucking the shareholder over is also a way to fuck them over (future job prospects, their value/share). Sumit Sharma (CEO) has said numerous times that he want's to see MVIS get its fair market value and best value for shareholders. Of course there is always a risk in any stock though. However, I don't see it with this."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Based on other companies valuations, specifically in the LiDAR sector. With one being at \~8-10billion (Luminar I believe - LAZR). If MVIS in fact does have superior LiDAR technology, which they have mentioned multiple times as being ""best in-class"", then they should be valued higher. That will be confirmed this month with their A-Sample.

 That is where you get the \~60pps from. That is only for ONE of their verticals."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not reading that, bitch"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is true and I agree.  I don’t think we are going to have BO news for at least a few months but I believe we will have a run up past recent $24 high in the next 30 days due to A sample lidar PR and that’s why I have a handful of May $25s and the leaps are for the really big news of BO or major partnership.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some companies, like Motorolla, are purchased for their patent moats. MVIS is one such company. The patent valuation alone is estimated at $7-$10bn, so it's current $2bn valuation is what I call a 'deep discount'.

With your logic I should've never bought Tesla calls all these years.

My bet is you are poor."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s no product to sell bc the market hasn’t emerged yet. It’s emerging now, and the tech MVIS has is exactly what will be needed, in MULTIPLE VERTICALS. product will be complete in April after demo, payday comes after $$$"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That is a great question for your accountant!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends it would be a short term capital gain if they paid out in cash within one year. If they did a share swap, you could potentially hold those for the (combined) length of a year and those could become long term capital gains"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"How long ago did you buy those? The premiums have been too high for me lately. I did but a couple May and June calls on March 31. I had a 135% gain in 1 day!

I should've sold before end of day apparently since gain is now just 55% or so. No biggie. This was just a little ""birthday money"". I couldn't be sure if 50% was the top of the pop or if more investors would catch on about MVIS and push it even higher.

It's never a BAD idea to lock in a 100% gain! 

The toughest part about interesting is removing the emotion."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold half of the stock the company I work for gave me to buy more mvis 😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m guessing the lesson was that cash wasn’t  settled and since it was under a dollar I think there are more restrictions on buying power with unsettled funds. At least that’s that’s been my experience with fidelity in the past.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got my eye on this as well. I am going to a vocational school, from what I heard I'll qualify for $10k. Which is about a third, not complaining.  

Got hyped for MVIS during the first  GME run. Now sitting on 300 shares with an average of $16. Still think I'm set up for a good return on this."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The more time you sleep, the quicker this demo and then (fingers crossed) the buyout comes.  So sleep!  I think a good and more realistic number lives somewhere between 12-18"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was more so getting at how calls might be slightly more complicated were MVIS to spin off one of its verticals as opposed to selling the entire company outright. Just because with shares you would just receive the value of whatever the one vertical was bought out for in the form of a dividend whereas with calls you might need to sell after the dividend amount was priced into the calls and then if you wanted in on the other aspects of MVIS that were remaining, you would buy back in again afterwards. Since it would be a special dividend I would expect the calls to temporarily increase in value (as you point out), but to ultimately settle once the dividend was issued at whatever the market values MVIS sans the sold vertical."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Typically they adjust the option price down to accommodate the special dividend.  See RKT option chain.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So say you’re a shareholder that wants to buy in but you want the most bang for your buck. In this hypothetical, you buy calls on MVIS and afterwards MVIS receives 8b (cash, to make things simpler) for its LiDAR - which will be distributed to shareholders through a special dividend. You sell your calls after the premium on your calls skyrocket to factor in the dividend (since the majority of the time, selling your calls for the premium is more advantageous than exercising). Since you still want in on the other verticals you now have to watch for a reentry point into MVIS once the dividend has been issued, at whatever market cap the other many verticals (the value of which are somewhat speculative at this point in time) are priced at by the market. Choosing the right reentry point on verticals that are at an inflection point and will likely be prone to volatility is a difficulty that call holders have to deal with that people just holding shares would not. It might be minor, especially since in this scenario you’d already have the gains from the LiDAR sale so you might not care, but it’s something else you would have to consider if you’re holding calls rather than shares."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Weird, it's back. Not sure if wsb mods are doing something or reddit issue"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Very nice
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's fine, tl;dr you lost."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Any source on the patent valuation?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t buy penny stocks so way above poor.

Look I hope it works out for you but I don’t see any hidden gem here."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope you all make tendies. 

At the current price it doesn’t make sense to invest in it since it was around $2 a few months back as given its revenues that’s the price it should be at.

I guess the potential buy out justifies a higher price."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s great! Don’t worry about your average, this company is criminally undervalued right now. You have a great ROI in store for you."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I eat rice with rice!

Rice 10/10, with rice 11/10"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Google it
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, fair point"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. I'm 95% shares but have dipped my toes into some May calls. Calls are inherently riskier since you are paying a premium by definition to control more shares than your liquidity investment.

Can payout nicely, but there is some risk of not capturing all the upside in some circumstances.

I buy and hold shares to accumulate. And play calls just to flip when I feel the stock price is majorly oversold. It's how I fight the urge to trade the shares I am accumulating. Flip calls on bounces and buy shares on dips with the proceeds. If we dip further, buy some more calls to scratch the itch."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently not lol. Get ratioed bitch
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guess you could say that.. or it could be that MVIS was extremely undervalued for the past couple years. Depends on what DD you find. And thank you, I’m planning on making a nice bag from this investment. Avg price $10.. been adding since $2 and haven’t stopped since👍"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How much cash and how many stocks in the acquiring company?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Many of the price targets for the short term are $30-45 by end of April and when it moves it moves fast. May $25 strike calls for short term will likely print to flip on the next big run this month. Leaps - Jan 2022 $35 calls are cheap for the least amount of risk if the big event takes a few months to fully play out. I think a conservative price target is $60 a share and blue sky price target $120. Those calls will be a goldmine at $60-120.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This...sell the calls on the spike to take advantage of the IV increase.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’ve been doing the same, just flipping calls to take advantage of the volatility but leaving my core share position alone. At first I would buy shares with the intention to sell on the next spike, but buyout/catalyst fomo causes me to just buy and hold the shares in the end lol. The volatility here is amazing for swing trading."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I think maybe you're projecting onto the mods.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will take time to finalize the deal but the stock price will still jump and hover around the expected buyout price. So if you aren’t interested in waiting you should still make out good after the announcement. Unless of course we have multiple offers and tier 1s are out bidding each other. In that situation sticking it out would be worth it. 

Depending on the final deal I’ll probably pull some out at the announcement then let the rest ride. Unless we get a stock offer and get a 10:1 on google shares or something like that. I would certainly keep the Google shares to avoid short term capital gains."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on what the buyout price is. If your strike is a penny higher than buyout, they're pretty much worthless. Ask me how I know. Also, IV tanks big time after the buyout price is announced, so that kills premium a lot as well."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Buyout should be higher than any strike currently out there. So you should be able to flip the contracts or exercise if you have the funds.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t enough to say conclusively, I’m still a layman, but I don’t see it hitting 60$ by May. 

But I’m a degenerate so I’ll buy both! Thanks for your thoughts"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Those 35 2023s look tasty too
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You think it will reach that price soon?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If we don’t get BO or major partnership news then it would be a stretch to hit $60 by May for sure. I think we will be over $35 by then though. Either way I see us having a decent spike by the end of April when the PR hits about A sample Lidar and that is when I’ll be selling the May $25s.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,$35 is a realistic target by the end of April. Once the lidar news drops we should have another 50%+ green rocket.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,$15x1.5=22.5....
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just so you and the other smooth brains reading this understand, I said 50%+, meaning it could be 50 or BIGGER. You’re also assuming the price will still be at 15 when the news drops. The price could easily get back to 24 before the lidar news drops. Since you like math 24x1.5=36......"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you doing 1.5?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,OMFG JUST GET A ROOM AND HATE FUCK 69 ALREADY (and call me maybe +1-310-865-1234).
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because he said 50%

Don’t get me wrong I’m about to yolo on MVIS it seems set up to go well."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The more the merrier 🙌🏻
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Literally nothing happens different to other contracts. You could sell your contracts immediately upon announcement on the spike in share price, or you could hold until the buyout is completed. If it's a stock share buyout, or has stock shares, then you could execute your call options early, own the stock, and then get your compensation for the shares you have.

If you don't have the liquidity to cover executing the calls, then selling them after the BO announcement would be just fine.

Calls at that point wouldn't have any/much extrinsic value, all the value would be intrinsic, or the difference in share price after announcement vs. strike price.

So if you paid $10 (per share, so $1,000 per contract) for 2022 options with a strike price of $20, your breakeven cost is $30. If the share price rose to $100, you would make $7000 in profit per contract ($100-30)\*100. 

Only reason I can think of that you would potentially want to execute the calls would be in the case of a stock swap deal. You could execute the contract, own the shares, and then when they convert to the acquiring company's shares you could hold until you unlock capital gains taxes.

Maybe after announcement of first buyout a second better offer comes from someone else, that's another reason to potentially hold. But the initial buyout offer would act as a ""floor"" for the share price which would in turn support your call option price to a minimum of the intrinsic value."
2021-04-02 23:11:02,wallstreetbets,"UNIT DD - COMMUNICATIONS/INFRASTRUCTURE PLAY - FIBER/REIT - AMERICAN JOBS PLAN - MICHAEL J. BURRY Hi Everyone, I have been a retard on here for almost a year. Mostly just a lurker and upvoter but decided to start doing some DD. Looking forward to feedback and discussion on this stock.

**EDIT 1:** u/dickpal made note that Blackrock and Vanguard are not direct backers but are the largest shareholders due to their ETF’s they manage and the fact that UNIT is a part of those ETF’s make them the largest shareholders

**EDIT 2:** Uniti signed a deal with Dish Network in November 2020 to help them roll out their 5G network

**EDIT 3:** u/mikecm11 pointed out their EPS was (-3.47) which appears to be a bad thing. However after looking into it it appears **REIT's valuations are calculated differently** than regular stocks where EPS is not very important and use number's like **FFO** to calculate their true value when compared to other REIT's. There is an article here [*https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/reits/reit-investing-101/7-valuation-metrics-you-need-to-know/*](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/reits/reit-investing-101/7-valuation-metrics-you-need-to-know/) which explains more. It looks like it may take me a little while to fully understand the meaning behind each calculation and compare it with UNIT's performance. But that is a starting point for anyone who is interested until I am able to gather more details and post it.

**TL;DR for retards at bottom**

I am going to break this DD down into 4 parts.

1. **The Company**
2. **The American Jobs Plan (Infrastructure Plan)**

***What is a REIT?***

According to [*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp)

""A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. Modeled after mutual funds, REITs pool the capital of numerous investors. This makes it possible for individual investors to earn dividends from real estate investments—without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves.""

""REITs can play an important part in an investment portfolio because they can offer a strong, stable annual dividend and the potential for long-term capital appreciation. REIT total return performance for the last 20 years has outperformed the S&P 500 Index, other indices, and the rate of inflation.﻿""

**2. The American Jobs Plan**

This last Thursday, President Biden unveiled his plans for a 2.2 Trillion dollar infrastructure plan, which includes plans on how to :

Fix highways, rebuild bridges, upgrade ports, airports and transit systems. Deliver clean drinking water, a renewed electric grid, and **high-speed broadband to all Americans.**

One of the goals of the plan is to:

**Build high-speed broadband infrastructure to reach 100 percent coverage.** The President’s plan prioritizes building “future proof” broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas so that we finally reach 100 percent high-speed broadband coverage. It also prioritizes support for broadband networks owned, operated by, or affiliated with local governments, non-profits, and co-operatives—providers with less pressure to turn profits and with a commitment to serving entire communities. Moreover, it ensures funds are set aside for infrastructure on tribal lands and that tribal nations are consulted in program administration. Along the way, it will create good-paying jobs with labor protections and the right to organize and bargain collectively.

The plan includes providing **$100 Billion dollars** to build this infrastructure.

\&#x200B;

The fiber optic network in the United States is worth about $5 Billion in 2020, now if we UNITI were to grab even 1% of the proposed $100 Billion, that could **increase their market cap by about 30% or more**

[*https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/fiber-optics-market-238443438.html*](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/fiber-optics-market-238443438.html)

\&#x200B;

**TL;DR Pt. 2 - The American Jobs Plan could provide the opportunity and capital for UNITI to grow much more rapidly in size within the next several years**

*data from* [*https://whalewisdom.com/filer/scion-asset-management-llc#tabholdings\_tab\_link*](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/scion-asset-management-llc#tabholdings_tab_link)

***ETF Exposure -*** According to [*https://www.etf.com/stock/UNIT*](https://www.etf.com/stock/UNIT) Uniti is being held in **78 U.S. - traded ETF's.** and has around 45.8 M shares in the U.S. ETF market. The largest of which is iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (**IJR**) with approximately 15.38M shares. Another notable ETF's include the **IWM** and **VNQ** with about 4 million shares each.

Bonus - It also pays 0.6 dividend

\&#x200B;

**TL;DR Pt. 3- UNIT is backed by some pretty smart investors, including Blackrock, Vanguard, and Michael Burry**

\&#x200B;

**4. Short Squeeze Possibility**

*According to fintel* [***https://fintel.io/ss/us/unit***](https://fintel.io/ss/us/unit)

Short Interest as of 3/15 is 7.49%

However, days to cover is at 4.18 due to low volume in this stock.

If 85% of the float is owned by institutions, that means 85% of 225 million is about 191 million. Which leaves about 34 million shares remaining.

If we say only 1 million WSB subscribers actually are active and have money to spend, they could potentially grab hold of the free float market share

1 Million x 34 shares each ($383) = free float capture = squeeze.

Not to mention the options market and a gamma squeeze possibility. If you look at the options chain there is only 2,216 open call contracts which expire 4/16. And there are open contracts available in $1 increments and are dirt cheap ($5). So a couple hundred thousand contracts OTM ($12 - $20) spaced out evenly by some retards definitely has the potential for a wicked gamma squeeze.

\&#x200B;

**5. Price Action - On friday close I saw some very interesting price action.**

It bounced up and down all day basically from $11.00 to $11.15 extremely consistently until about 12:30 when the price rocketed from $11.00 to $11.28 at close. Now, this could've been shorts covering, or people getting ready knowing it's about to take off soon.

The last minute of the ticker saw some wicked buy orders of about 250k shares.

\&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

**UNIT looks like a solid fundamental investment, backed by Smart money like** **~~Blackrock, Vanguard, and~~** **Michael Burry. In addition the American Jobs Plan provides a tremendous opportunity for this company to grow it's fiber optic network and leaseback opportunities. On top of that, a squeeze play is also quite possible, both with short squeeze and gamma squeeze potential. It may be boring but growth looks like it's fading and value is becoming the name of the game.**

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good collection of info. Adding to this:

P/E multiples are useless when valuing REITs; use NOI and balance sheet NAV to calculate cap rates and inverse it.

Another metric that is much more dependable is P/B, at least for a 10-K -- as these will have mark-to-market assets. Even then, you still probably need to mark-to-market the debt.

Overall, M2M for Assets and Debt will get you a proper financial metric -- I doubt that many care for this, but for the few financial valuation-centric investors: this is the way."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,username checks out
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,so that explains why i see them in literally every stock pretty much. thanks for the explanation. will edit
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Starlink will eat their lunch in the rural areas. $499 + $99/mo and service issues in poor weather will have a hard time competing with fiber where it’s properly built out. 

I’m willing to acknowledge this as a Starlink (psth) truther/holder .

Bigger question for OP since he did all this investigation: why the negative EPS in the most friendliest of times for anything in the internet business? And is the share price near all time lows because of share dilution or poor performance?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,REITs dont pay dividends. They pay distributions. Distributions are not subject to the 50% mark down that dividends are for tax purposes. As such REITs are great for 401k or RRSP/TFSA but should not be held in margin accounts.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No nothing to add, this is pretty accurate tbh. Im out for this same reason"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,NP. Used to work in one of them.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes ""distributions"".  Alot of people dont know the technical difference.  I like these in my Roth & kids ESAs."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ditto.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya I have smart centres reit in my rrsp. Pays a handsome solid 7% and I have it in a drip. Going to just roll that forever until I retire in 30 years.
2021-04-03 06:39:28,wallstreetbets,[Loss] I truly belong here 
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"For those wondering why it’s tagged as loss (because you are retarded as OP): OP could have sold the contract for $15,000 but instead sold for $385.

OP did not hold on to the contract for too long, as indicated by the time stamp in the RH message.

The fact that I have to explain it shows that options are a fucking mistake to all you retards"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s why your wife left you
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it’s good enough to take a screenshot, it’s good enough to sell."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamond balls were forged but tendies were lost in the process 💯
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’ve been robbed by Robinhood, any decent broker would fill you the highest bid price at the market even if you entered a “bad” limit order."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m struggling to understand what you were holding on for, but obviously that’s what got you to (almost) making a huge return."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This $100 call option was not worth 15,000. The price on 2/26 was very close to the strike. This price was only displayed due to a liquidity issue with only one published ask price at a ridiculous amount that would never fill. This can happen at the end or beginning of the trading day before market makers fulfill their contractual obligations.

Correction: I see that GME was at $119 during the screenshot which indicates that his call option was worth around 19.00-30.00 depending on time left on the contract. The bid-ask spread is fake because he took the screenshot after the market closed. Never consider option prices to be accurate when the market is closed."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't get it
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey at least you tried
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Dawg I had $45k at my height with GME. I ended up exiting with $10k on a $1k investment. That's not a loss and neither is yours.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Turning $100 into $15K wasn’t enough for you?!? 

Thats 1000% your own fault. AND YOU GUYS SAY THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE THE GREEDY ONES? 😂"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"this retard was up 15,000% and didn’t sell."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been there 2 weeks I'm a row.. freaking sucks. Held to long on runners. I need more self control
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jeez!  This is truly a loss. 

I highly recommend you to get out of Robinhood if you haven't already. It was certainly your mistake and you became the Christmas miracle of an unsuspecting call writer, but a proper brokerage that doesn't use PFOF or has an interest to serve you better would've given you the best market price possible. 

More than once Merrill Lynch has given me a better price than my limit when selling or buying options."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So selling calls for profit is a loss now lol... better put them in actual shares and convert ya account to cash. Turn off instant settlement. Not financial advice
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish all my losses were gains.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it’s good enough to screenshot

It’s been good enough to sell for a while"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes. I too like to purchase my shares like a retard. 

Seriously you fucking belong here. Can we make OP mod? That fast 300$ though."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy General Electric now make some money over the next 12 months
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options with this stock is like playing Russian roulette with a double barrel shot gun for big money ( duel trigger, one loaded barrel).

You can eather win big, or loose messy as hell.

There's not much room in the middle."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit old
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh how the mighty have fallen
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but wsb considers loss to be a net loss right? OP belongs here, but not his thread 😔"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I had a similar experience before. I make sure I check the current price before I sell
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a true retard! I have no idea how this is bad. 
Looks like 15 grand in equity to me! 😋"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,U don’t deserve dat money i guess
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks I was as lost as OP
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks man
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Still not a loss though
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,By this theory DFV has loss porn with his calls
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"He spent $100 on that option. If he'd gotten in early enough he could have bought *one share*, which at Thursday's prices would have doubled in value. Instead he 3x'd over a month ago and has been able to do *whatever he wants* with the money since then. 

Options are a mistake for people who are scared of risk. You will not turn $100 into $30k (even if you mistime the top and lose most of it) in any reasonable time-frame buying shares.

We like to trade options because with the amplified risk comes amplified rewards. Thanks to options, I walked away from the GME saga two weeks after I entered with 10 bagger, despite missing the top by literal days and getting IV crushed at the tail end of the squeeze. Making the same moves with shares could maybe have given me 3x. Had I played it *perfectly* - 100% perfect, I *maybe* could have pulled down 5x, but that would have been playing it absolutely perfect. Playing it perfect with options, if my math is correct, would have been more like 25x.

Options are only a mistake if you're a coward."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The explanation made me laugh harder than the actual post. Thanks man
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The highest bid was 12.50 and highest ask 300. Fake news, no one would have bought it for that high"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the explanation. Reported as misuse of flair because that's not how ""loss"" works."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I got too cocky :/
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,May the balls be with you.   I've been there done that....welcome home son
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't feel too bad i had four 390c expiring 03/05 and only sold one on the big spike that week for like 2700 and held the other 3 hoping it would continue going up and eventually sold the other 3 for next to nothing lolol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,People are truly retarded. So many RH screenshots.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The screenshot isn’t fake but I took it when it hit a breaker that morning. The actual peak of my call was 8k when GME hit around $185. This is the only screenshot I have from that day :/ also the first screenshot is from that Thursday and I sold on Friday.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Was up a couple thousand and sold for $200 profit
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"15,000% his fault. true retard"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP just held too long and his contract became worth significantly less than it was when it peaked.

GME was close to his break even at close on expiration, which is when it was executed."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Had TD do this on a few limits recently. Nickel or penny here and there.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You don’t understand
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I was banned for a while
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Not at all because dude sold his already
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Squeeze has not squoze.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact you’re being downvoted shows how little people understand spreads.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"$385.00/100 shares = $3.85/share. If the contract sold at $12.50 it would be $1250 if it sold at $300 it would be $30,000. Instead it sold at op's minimum price of $3.85 for a $385 contract price"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,uhh.. exercise the contract and sell the shares ???
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah...did the same thing when I was at like $195k and didn’t sell. Sold for $30k.

Edit. In relative terms we both equally fucked ourselves."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wasn’t implying that the screenshot was fake. I was just stating that there was only one unreasonable ask price which created a fake price for the option. The underlying was 119 during the screenshot and thus not even close to worth 300.00. The screenshot was taken at 6:57. I assumed the market was closed based on that time and a lack of option liquidity. I suppose you can be in a different time zone and the circuit breaker would result in option liquidity issues. On 2/25, GME did hit 184.68 for a brief period so you could have sold for over 8k, but your window of opportunity was small."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Options prices are always fucked during trading halts
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good job, retard."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently the spread was really wide and it wasn’t actually selling for that high. In that case he’s just a loser for even posting the pic 😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh, sure, why not. At some point John Frum will descend from the clouds on his giant shining bird and bring you and the other apes all the tendies you could ever desire. I'm sure all you gotta do is keep saying the right words and doing the right actions and he will come back one day. [Fucking Cargo Cultists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult?wprov=sfla1)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You have a gain marked as a loss and you expected to have hope....
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"same thing.  Nobody would have bought it for $15,635."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m in California bro, it opens at 6:30 here"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,spread or no spread the value of that deep itm call could be exercised and sold the shares for 6k profit
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,My call peaked at 8k but this was the only screenshot I had of that day :/
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe not for $15,365 but for $130/share, absolutely."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Which is why I said you may be in a different time zone in my response.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep true
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"He owned a call option with an expiration date of 02/26, not shares.  He purchased the option for $1.04 ($104 total)."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"fuck why can’t i be in these 15,000% profit positions lmao"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You must be new at this. The contract represents the ability to buy 100 shares. Somebody would of paid $130/share (also known as the premium) or $13,000 for the contract at that time. An ask price of $130 would have been filled immediately."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would somebody pay $130/share on top of the $100 strike for a total price of at least $230, when the share price was $156.35?

The intrinsic value was $56.35 ($156.35 share - $100 strike).  A $130 premium would be an extrinsic value of $73.65 ($130 share - $56.35  intrinsic value). The option was expiring in 1 day."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re right, I’m a full blown retard. I also belong here."
2021-04-03 06:24:33,wallstreetbets,GO BIG OR SLEEP ON THE STREET — YOLO 
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit

Edit: Nvm, just saw date of expiry. This play might be a little too conservative for me personally"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I got a refrigerator box I will sell you for $34
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remaining buying power $34.83, This is the way"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck you could be making so much damn money by selling covered calls against all of those positions...
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If you’re homeless... just buy a house.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf January 2022? That’s not how we apes play options. Let me repeat. We spend our Wendy’s paychecks so we can buy short term way out of the money options that will either make us homeless or millionaires
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Numbers too big for my understanding
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd be careful with AMC. They are pissing off all the apes that saved their company from bankruptcy. Although I'm sure some of that hate is just the GME-only crowd. I'm making money selling weekly or monthly calls and puts. 1.5% gains per week or 6% per month doubles your money in a year.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Any Robinhood ss gets shit on here except ones with AMC and GME. This sub is full of NPCs
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Retarded on so many levels.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,BDE 🦧
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Alright who gave this ape all this money
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, life changing money! I hope you land on moon fellow autist!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,IV CRUSH IS REAL！
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If that was a 4/09 expiry.....🚀🚀

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"YOLOing on a company that was dying before the pandemic even hit, has diluted its shares 4x in the last year, and wants to dilute again by doubling the number of shares. Solid move."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could afford that 🤣 have nine in gme and 8 in amc
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro LEAPS aren’t a yolo
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"And here I am struggling to reach 1000 AMC shares! But you sure motivated me to do it!

AMC🚀🌕💎🙌"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought that same AMC call the day before Robinhood destroyed us.

I paper handed out at 295."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Enjoy your cardboard box because AMC's balance sheet gonna need A LOT of money from guys like you.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Over 200 AMC calls expire in 2022. Congrats
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Robinhood ? U have half a million and u choose RH. Wow
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Get off of robinshit. You’re gonna miss the squeeze and the sell button will stop existing
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you meant to hit ""sell"" on those calls ... :) If you sell calls in AMC , you be cha.chinging a linging"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Currently sleeping on the street
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve got 20 4/09 12.5c . Should I cash out the few hundred they’re worth or let it ride till expiry?

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Robinhood? Really? Bruh
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like a royal flush to me

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is dead. The company is saving themselves and will dilute. They have no turn around story and the execs are cashing out.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro sell those amc stocks I lost 14k on them in the past month so far and don’t see them coming back
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This portfolio is way too diversified. Sell the AMC and double down on GME.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"An actual LEAP? Sir this is WSB, please post only if you got FD's smh"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,rip 🤦‍♂️
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everything is perfect 🤩 except the RH User interface, use TD, Schwab, Fidelity anything but..."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Biggest risk here is RH
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why the hell do you have so much in robinhood? Rh is meant to be a little play account. Anyways I hope you turn that into double commas!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Got amc calls for 4/23
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is pretty risking since we are now heading towards a new wave of covid infections.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow, that was a bad idea.

Price targets for this stock are well under $12, more dilution is coming, and there is no clear indications that movie theater revenues will return to pre-COVID levels.  (and pre-COVID #'s were already trending downward)

If it were me, I'd strongly consider getting away from those calls.

For the stock, might as well sell CC's and make some income.  That would offset stock value price drops.  Of course if stock moons you'd miss out; however, not sure what the odds of that are these days."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh I’m doing the same play with $OGI. Good luck ape man
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,*And/or

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Charge your battery ape
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,lel you investing now not yolo
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not both?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,daaaaaaayum
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Now that is impressive.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no idea what those option plays mean. Can someone explain to this turd what this call is please?

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Please for the love of god transfer to Fidelity. Leave a few shares if you like the pretty colors but do you seriously trust Robinhood with like a billion $$ if it squeezes
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Dang this guy fucks! 🤘🏼 let’s bankrupt these hedgies!! 🚀
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How the fuck do you have 2000 shares and still use robinhood???
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"January 2022? might as well buy a damn 10 year treasury, fortunes will be made and lost well before then"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's nothing conservative about it. Dude paid a heavy premium for time. People think Leaps are some less risky play, but they're far from it. He's banking on a big move, if it moves decently up soon, then good, if not then this will be a painful long."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"With that much money, you can be conservative and still make bank lol"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Better not to be fake like your sunglasses
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this is a margin account, then this is the way."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Purposely do that for Robbinghood Gold
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, he could make around $8,000/week selling pretty OTM calls on those"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,he cant sell any calls because he doesnt have shares. this shit is fake as fuck
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hos for years.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I don’t understand why anyone would ever buy options more than a week or two out.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,they were only saved for this year. they still have $5 billion of debt to get through
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"until IV either drop out or stock price drops down, then you are either forced to sell quarterlies for a pittance or risk assignment and eating a loss.

But if you're going to be holding them either way, might as well."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine not understanding how A M C has taken advantage of retail, and actually thinking you’re fighting “Hedgies” when there’s like 11% of float shorted. 

I have yet to see any coherent logic with actual data from these clowns that think it’s still going to moon somehow."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop regurgitating the shit you see every other FUDfuck posting. 
Gamestop is and was a failing retail chain, and their officers were laying down and ready to be bankrupted by these shorts before your GOD Ryan Cohen stepped in. Lmao

AMC is a fucking fighter. You do you, boo. Have fun holding the bags when Gaymestop comes back to earth."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You'll lose it all if you don't cash out. AMC has fucked their short term holders, aka the guys that brought them out of bankruptcy"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The hedgies have you on a big white couch and they are all standing around you with their shlongs out waiting for you to please every single one of them. They and CNBC have you EXACTLY in the right position. You’re gonna please them so well. I bet you’re rock hard thinking about it.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea CNBN said AMC no moon 🤡
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao what the fuck you're trolling right?

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,All I want to know is what play you made to go from 10k to 500k. Very impressive retard
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,selling calls on meme stocks is not the smartest thing
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The reason is simply because the further you go out and the deeper ITM the calls are then the closer you are to simulating real shares  


Also a big part of it is Theta decay. It eats up your money if you get a short term option."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the low price attracts new investors. People want it to be the next GME and think it will shoot up to $100+ from $9. They’ll make up all sorts of reasons to justify buying it lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow that's a lot of dumb shit.

AMC: stuck under 14$. Has enormous liquidity.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah anyone who doesn't agree with your opinion is a 'hedgie'. do you have any evidence that AMC will moon?

AMC has only 10% short interest. what evidence do you have that those shorts are even from institutions rather than retail? insiders own 9% of shares, institutions own 10%, the other 80% is retail. if retail own most of the shares, they've probably done most of the shorting too.

AMC is overvalued as is, has $5 billion in debt, has diluted shares from 100M to 450M in the span of a few months, and is talking about adding 500M more, which would cut share price in half. 

I don't know the future so i don't know for sure whether it goes up or down, but what's the case for a moon shot? i don't see it"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Covered calls are very different from naked calls. If he sells covered calls above his cost basis and it ends above his strike he collects premium and the difference. If the stocks go down he collects the premium and lowers his cost average. Covered calls don’t get blown out like naked calls

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t even add the dilution of shares into the equation. That is pretty much irrelevant. Just because CNBC scared a bunch of people doesn’t make it true. It would be the same thing as saying Kanye West is going to be our next president just because he is running for president. That is why we are voting. Do you think the retail investors that own a vast majority of the shares want to dilute? Why do you think there is a vote to revote on dilution if the first vote is no? To dilute at a higher price after a squeeze? Just a theory but sounds right. The CEO is well aware that the people he would be helping by doing a dilution have been trying to fuck him out of existence.The percentage of short interest is probably way higher than what we know. When these people start having to buy back their shares, then we will see. To just flat out say “a squeeze won’t happen” is just talk. There is more evidence for a squeeze at this point then not having a squeeze. GME and AMC will both squeeze. People were saying the same shit about GME when it was trading up and down in the 8-13 dollar range and now look at the price."

> People were saying the same shit about GME when it was trading up and down in the 8-13 dollar range and now look at the price

when GME was in that range, short interest was something absurd like 140%. i see 10% on AMC currently"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Or a whale's vagina.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That's diversity. I think he may be referring to the idea that something holds or catches one's attention
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I first went to work in 1990, my boss had $1.5 Million in 16% yield long term CD’s. He retired very well off."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where do you see 10% short interest quoted? Because in January it was somewhere around 50% and GME was around 140%. If they have covered 40% of that even over the past 2.5 months, the price would be higher than $9-$14. Even if it was say 12%-15% short, that is still short enough for a squeeze."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s about the time my broker sold me on 200 shares of Enron stock with a price target of $50 by the year 2000. Different times for sure!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Just write em naked
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I’m aware. This is what makes me even more sure a squeeze will happen. I feel if they wanted to prevent it, they would publicly post what they shorted and how they shorted it. That would literally put an end to it all."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,how can you sell covered puts? the covering at puts just means that you deposit the cash needed to buy em at strike price or not?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"devil's advocate: if 80% of shares are owned by retail, then 80% of trade options might also be retail. which would mean hedge funds have 2% of float short interest, and the other 8% is retail. 

>they would publicly post what they shorted and how they shorted it

do hedge funds publicly disclose their trade option positions? i see no reason why they couldn't also have bought calls to profit from the spike"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling cash covered puts means you have the money on hand when you open the position.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m saying that if you are so bullish that you are buying shares AND selling puts, you might as well just write them naked  since you are so certain the stock will rise"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It all comes down to the amount. If they bought calls to hedge their shorts, they would just be taking on more risk. They also pay a borrow fee on the shorts so the risk wouldn’t be worth. And yes, they could very easily post their positions and it would get national attention. If everyone saw that the shorting was that bad, the stock would tank and they would win."

2021-04-03 06:04:36,wallstreetbets,"RKT's pivot point in 3rd week of Apr So I see a lot of people complain about RKT's price action - it looks like it's continuing its trend of trading sideways with an oscillation since its IPO, even with the large spike on Mar 2nd. However, I just want to remind everyone that we have not completed an oscillation cycle after the big spike. I will do a quick FFT analysis to get the frequency of oscillation and show that the 3rd week of April is the turning point. I will discuss the two outcomes: if RKT continues its oscillation (short term bullish), or if RKT wants to trade with a new regime (unclear outlook).

RKT closing price since IPO:

Taking the Fourier transform, and then fitting the low frequency peak with a Lorentzian:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ax7qu55d7vq61.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cd03ddb621dc581b6e2ac2e15d4e615f1846d8c

We get the following parameters of the lorentzian:

y0	=25.305 ± 2.89

A 	=0.012523 ± 0.00457

x0	=0.032551 ± 0.00155

B 	=0.00015029 ± 6.38e-05

&#x200B;

x0 is the peak center, and a frequency of 0.032551 (1/trading days) translate to a period of 30 trading days. From the Mar 2nd spike, which is very well-defined, we get Apr 14th as the next point in the cycle.

As we look to be currently in the trough of a cycle, there are 2 possibilities:

1. We continue the oscillation cycle, meaning that we will turn bullish over the course of the next week or 2. This can be caused by swing traders and technical traders anticipating the end of this cycle and turning it into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
2. It's possible that others already consider the big spike to have broken the cycle and RKT doesn't continue trade with the oscillation. This can be both bearish and bullish, but at least we will trade in a new regime and people can stop complaining about how RKT is trading sideways.

I personally think RKT will likely continue to trade with the oscillation, because the big spike happened to occur at the same time as the bullish part of the cycle, which would reinforce the oscillation. I think there needs to be a big piece of news at the trough of the cycle to break it.

Edit: the main point of this analysis to provide the time frame where you can look for this continuation or breakout. I provided a short argument for why I think it might trade a certain way, but you should decide how you want to trade RKT."

They can only supply their top few customers and the rest don't get any siding. This is going to really cause problems for banks.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fast Fourier Transforms are operations used on signal data. The stock price isn’t a signal being emitted and measured its price data driven by human action. This is mathematically done correctly but it’s just another way to generate a formula that gives you a graph that matches similarly but there is literally no reason to believe  doing FFTs means the price is trending a certain way. It is just a graph that happened to have that shape.

That being said, very bullish on RKT, finishing up loan papers this week with them. I disagree with OP, but wouldn’t mind buying a few shares next week

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the beginning it was maybe coincidence. Once the oscillation takes a hold it gets reinforced because swing traders will anticipate this and their trades in turn reinforces the oscillation. For example, short sellers might anticipate the upswing coming up and cover, causing the price to rise. Until some news breaks the cycle i do expect it to continue."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The summary is as follows: Based on his presumption that the price chart of RKT will continue to oscillate to infinity, he says this happens every ~1/0.04 trading days, or approx 25 odd trading days."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"fft tells you the ""distribution"" of frequencies in some time-series curve. So here there is a strong component of a oscillation that has a 30 trading day period.

In fact, RKT may earn extra income when loans go bad (up to a point, of course).  RKT is not a bank and doesn't hold the mortgages.

Inflation is bad for mortgages.  But we know what the mortgage market will likely look like. It's $2T minimum. People aren't going to stop seeking shelter because interest rates are high."

I do provide a short argument why I think it might trade a certain way - the longer the oscillations go on, the more reinforced it would tend to get withot big news. This is because swing traders and technical traders will reinforce it as long as volume is low."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks.  Went ahead and saved the post from visual mod for you, and did another command in the comments.  You should definitely do some more analysis like this in the future, look at a few different stocks to find the best pick analytically, and maybe use a few different methods to make a nice long post about why you think the price will move a certain way."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You've characterized the past, with considerable care. But the potential catalysts you offer for one future versus another seem just as valid without curve fitting (yours or any other) as with. In short, I don't see a thesis with predictive power here.

RemindMe! 3 weeks ""spectral curve fitting"""
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You cant throw an fft to anything, although the oscillation has continued for 4-5 cycles, the presumption behind the use of an fft is that the signal is infinitely continuing to do the same. This is unlikely.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Banks don't hold mortgages either.  Lenders make money off the fees they charge for their services.   The risk of holding the mortgage is offloaded elsewhere (MBS).
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree. However, people will seek less shelter. EG .. I know two couples my age who have had their Adult children move back home in the past year. That is 4 adults not taking up additional space. If RKT just writes the loans and sells the packages to hedgies.. They take less risk than a bank but also make lower margins. Guess we see how this plays out in the coming weeks. Some are saying that the market rises for another 4 years. If you look at the daily QQQ .. Gap up, Gap up ... Two days in a row where we gap up. This last one, we gapped up but no go.  So, was that just distribution? This is getting more confusing all the time."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Although inflation is bad for mortgages it's good for reducing refinances. Which eat away at lenders profit margins. It's probably a net wash.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So you're saying RKT is a high growth stock?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"RKT is a very careful lender. They never touched subprime loans. RKT's delinquency rate is less than 4% (from tjeir 10-K), even lower than industry average for before covid. If smaller lenders fall that will only mean RKT will get a larger piece of the pie"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The float is 104 million shares x $22 = 2.2 billion market cap

but you will see the market cap is $44 billion. The 44 billion includes all the shares that aren't currently in the float but can be added to the float at any time. Theres 1.6 billion more shares that will find there way into the common stock float. It probably won't happen now, but it will happen"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much!!!  I’ve been wanting to comment and support my fellow GME apes!!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Just kidding... I’m long with 12k shares and looking for confirmation bias 😬
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly that’s fair, you do. Just feel it’s kinda overlooked in comments, ya feel me? At the end of the day there’s no real reason (described) to think the price should/would follow the pattern. It’s like the Gestalt Law of continuity in psychology."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the assumption is that whoever bought half $1b shares at a premium probably has reason to believe this is the best place for that money to be right now, and when you have $500M to spend, you’re clued into things us regular folks aren’t."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Except for people who short??
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"no i'm just talking about short term price action with no comments on stock growth. Also I literally have zero mentions of a squeeze in my post, I'm just discussing a couple short term outcomes. I think you are putting words in my mouth lol, maybe read the post again and then think about accusing me of something?

Also, you know that the 20m shares was sold in private right? and not at the peak. He sold it privately for $25.25 when the price of the stock was $23. Please double check your info before you post"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So when should we purchase calls
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did give an opinion on why i think it would trade a certain way, but the I did not tie predictive powers to the analysis. The point of the analysis is to provide a date range where one can see if the stock will want to continue the pattern or not.
This is kind of in response to many RKT holders who complain this stock is going nowhere. So with this post im suggesting they can wait for at least 3rd week of Apr to see if this sideways trend is continuing or not"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,With higher interest rates a refi is less likely and thus the mortgage itself is worth more when resold.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. No. I owned it last year and it moved .01% and am done playing it. The higher 10 year and inflation going to hurt the housing market
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually think a larger float might help this stock. One of the downsides as a share holder is we get a very small percentage of ownership in the public float. That’s what keeps me scalping this instead of holding shares long.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh that’s because Dan Gilbert the owner owns most of them. Are you thinking Elon musk will flood the market with 227m Tesla shares and tank the price? 

Owners aren’t out there to screw shareholders. Dan especially seems to have a good eye for PR and wants to build good shareholder relations after recent IPO."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Im not a genius that noticed the discrepancy on my own. I saw it on seekingalpha... so yeah
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Volume is so low buying 500m$ might cause a spike above that price. Could’ve been a discount
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Cause there are no dumb rich people?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not buying stocks.  It's called short selling,  not short buying."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold in private?? What?? He sold for 24.75. Go and check what was price on monday of RKT and then come back to bullshit me. Noone pays more than the stock goes for when they buy big block. More than likely u re selling to broker and then he resells it for.profit etc. 

I dont need to reread your post since u cannot even provide.real.info about.price.

3weeks into.future is not short term btw."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well if you think it will continue to trade the oscillation then now is a good time for monthlies maybe. If not and you think he fundamentals and environment are good then leaps are fine, as IV has dropped quite a bit. But patience is needed for this stock."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Inflation means that housing prices go upward.

Whether people can afford them is a different story....not like that has stopped the banks in the past."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The company is good, im not saying not to buy the stock"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s not true, it’s a private holding...like a lot of other stocks do. They’re a part of the float but they are privately owned stocks. Complete speculation to assume they’ll all flood the market. 

500m worth just traded hands on a private sale at a price above current market price."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Those weren't public shares
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"He sold it privately (i.e. not on the open stock market) to one or a few buyers, so it doesn't affect stock prices. Its like a dark pool trade

3 weeks is definitely short term unless you are a high frequency trader...."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I was thinking about doing weeklies for rkt since iv is so cheap and it does seem like it will return to $23 but who knows with market makers
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I read that seekingalpha article about a month ago, but they're a certain type or ""class of shares"" that can be converted into common stock very easily - that was the way it was described"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that was his point.   If he bought those on the secondary market,  by the time he bought the last share he wouldve been paying $200/share (I made that number up arbitrarily, but the sentiment remains)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Meaning he could sell it to broker and that broker sold it again making massive gains and stock tanked. U see the correlation here?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you need to look deeper than a seeking alpha article man, they’re pretty trash most of the time. These shares are owned by the owner himself, who is not going to dilute his own company that’s trading at less than 3x p/s. He sold some recently but he did it off market so it wouldn’t impact the price directly. 

Elon musk owns 23% of Tesla but people don’t trade under the fear that he’ll dilute the price and dump his shit"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea but look at the date of sale. They sold it to MS for $25.25 a share on 3/31, and then MS sold it to one or a few buyers at 24.75 (see sec forms). The stock was at like $23 on and after 3/31, so there was no way anyone can sell on the open market for a quick buck. Dan sold his shares to one or a few long term investors who bought the stock at a premium compared to the open market price."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah true. Seeking alpha isn't that great but its worth noting that he can dilute the float.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,3/29 end of day it dropped to 23. His own company documents show it going for 24.75 so not sure where u getting 25.25. More than likely MS sold it for small profit of .50. Still it was danny that allowed this downfall to happen.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is wrong info. [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1569007/000095014221001141/xslF345X03/es210141241_4-gilbertd.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1569007/000095014221001141/xslF345X03/es210141241_4-gilbertd.xml)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean it’s a risk for literally any stock with private or institutional holdings..so every single stock. Ryan Cohen could dump 9m GME Shares any time but he won't. These articles are often crafted hit pieces that show up during periods of intense shorting.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got the number order mixed up. He sold it to Morgan Stanley priavtely for 24.75 on 3/31(shown by the sec forms). Then MS advertised it for 25.25 (see news about the block sale) again as a private sale. The sale didnt go through until after 3/31. MS make 50 cents a share fkr handling this sale. This is typical (IPO shares usually have similar cuts for the broker)
How was it a downfall? On 3/29 the price jumped because people heard about a potential sale at $25.25, meaning that they saw someone who was willing to pay a premium for the stock. It got sold off for other reasons."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No this is different, than Elon musk or Jeff Bezos (not sure about Ryan Cohen assuming the same for him)

Those guys (Elon and Jeff) as far as I know own common stock that are a part of the actual float. This is different in that they are a different class of shares that are subtly excluded in the float. I don't think that Dan Gilbert is going to flood us all with those 1.6 billion shares but I would expect to see the float increase by probably 50-100% in the next year, who knows how much in future years, not sure how that will affect the valuation of the company, because the company is legitimately worth $22 a share at least in any case regardless of the size of the float because it is a $50 billion company in the end"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Downfall because shorts were able to close theirs positions. Price was skyrocketing last friday already. Monday morning it went crazy. MS info about selling big block came later. Most people are blaming stock tanking on this sell.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s done to provide liquidity as the float gets eaten up by institutional holdings and by retail investors. Having liquidity in float is a genuinely good tactic and healthy for a share to a certain extent. It’s not something to fear if you understand how the company operates and who holds them. 

It’s essentially a non factor"
2021-04-03 05:33:47,wallstreetbets,"10k on TSLA 665p 4/9 - Call me Michael Beary 🐻 Bought these at close after TSLA sold off all day while SPY and QQQ rallied. The stock is in such a weak state I am predicting delivery numbers close to expectation will be a ""sell the news"" event. Since Tesla beat by 10%, and now all the bullpens are frothy with excitement... it's a less appealing position.

I saw some bullish YOLOs so I figured I'd share my bearish one.

(Also, $9,920 is approximately $10,000; right? The position was $10k at one point on Thursday.)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I will be back in a week to either congratulate you or enjoy some 🌈 🐻 loss porn
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I literally have 90% of my portfolio in 4/9 $662c so one of us will be happy Godspeed fellow degenerate.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Alright. So we got one guy yoloing on 700C and the other yoloing on 665P. I guess that means it will expire right around $682.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if 10k is a lot of money to you , but why not straddle. You seem to have thought this through. So why not just buy some insurance just in case you were wrong? or puts closer to the money?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"How can you say it is a ‘weak stock’ when it has literally outperformed expectations since day 1?  Its current valuation, whether it be $400 or $900, is a direct contradiction of your thesis.   

That being said, given how volatile TSLA is, in normal circumstances you might get an opportunity to exit this position with a healthy profit before expiry.  I play this ticker both ways, so I normally wouldn’t say this was a bad play.  But man, right now?  TSLA cooled off last trading day and is primed to continue climbing with the significant delivery beat as a catalyst.

TL;DR not a bad bet in principle but as usual with bers the timing is wronk and u r fuk"

I think you are in the higher probability trade here as more people are crowding into $700+ calls every week and they all expire worthless over and over again. NIO and TSLA rallied last week to deliver MaxPain for all the puts. It parked on the money as I shorted the shares Thursday and covered at the close as that was my target price for MaxPain. So, when you are 3 or 4 days away from expiry I would check the MaxPain as this stock is more manipulated than most."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"All EV stocks are beating. Tesla hit the high side of the consensus range. Nothing spectacular considering the stock price. So, I think lower is more probable than higher.  70/30 ... find out soon enough."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla's slowing down too-- that's why they haven't produced a single Model S or Model X all year.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,4h and Daily candles also show the down trend. The 1 day view highlights the recent weakness I am seeing versus overall market.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I literally think we gap up and run to 730 by Wednesday
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,staaaaahhhhp
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I've had like 3k waiting to be dropped on a yolo play. Read up about a lot of guys who saved for the Model 3 initially into a regular savings account instead of saving it in the stock. They would've had over $850,000 instead of $50,000 they saved for their Model 3.

I'm 3 years late to the game but I'm going to save all the money I can by putting it into the stock and see what happens by the time I want to buy one. I like the car. I like the stock."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, it is feeling like a RIP right now..

Looking at the WSB TSLA sentiment it is very bullish at 4:1

[https://stocks.comment.ai/trending.html](https://stocks.comment.ai/trending.html)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man, with enough volatility we can all feast on tendies :)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did buy ATM puts, and these were slightly ITM at close.

Straddling seems like a losing strategy to me, I'll have to check how that would have played out. IMO insurance just waters down a position, if I think I need to do this then I probably shouldn't make the trade."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Headlines say a lot of things.

Good luck!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nonsense, they destroyed sales with no S/X sales so very bullish. Market is forward looking and next qtr S/X sales will hit the roof. Tesla record profits."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is true, though my current thesis is TSLA is like QCOM in the 2000 tech bubble, a good company but grossly over valued. I think we are seeing the start of the 2-3 year sell off period as the EV bubble pops.

Of course, even if this 2-3 year sell off is happening, it can still rally in the short term. If TSLA hype relights I can easily get flattened on a weekly position. Though, if the hype doesn't relight on this 10% beat, I think panic sets in and it massively sells off.

""A 10% beat didn't even stop the downward trend? What will?"""
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do my own MaxPain math and I have it at $640 ... Does not mean he has to hold till Friday. If you watch TESLA trade you can see it Gap and Crap . Pop and Drop or Tank and Crank .. So, if he gets a Tank he can unload on someone else and cha ching and watch teh position expire at the money .. I sell TSLA premium as it is very high and very tough to beat being the buyer."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Too late for that!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hell yeah! Ride the wave 🚀🌠

What do you think happens Monday?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man you timed that perfectly, minus not selling your put at close... you really think it'll go to 675 next week?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"**🐻**  
🙏"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for rooting for me!

I have a couple trade plans, listed most to least probable:

1. TSLA opens way up: > 680, buy calls and either close puts for a loss immediately, or hold for 30-60 minutes to see how the day progresses.
2. TSLA opens flat: \~660, hold and monitor; sell at signs of sharp moves up.
3. TSLA opens down: < 650, celebrate and either harvest profit \~$4k per contract or hold for a couple days.

After one hour on Monday, if it is flat or down then I think it will be a bloodbath so I might hold the contracts for a couple days in this case."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, funnily enough I’m arguing against soft communism in another thread. Oh wait, no politics here! Just degenerate gambling :)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here's a popular TSLA bull talking about stock price impact: [https://youtu.be/KuhgJNAJVU4?t=740](https://youtu.be/KuhgJNAJVU4?t=740)

Looks like even he thinks it could fade.

Plus he says delivery numbers are already priced in and not super important; if they had missed he said he didn't expect much price impact."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Which broker?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why not?

I find paying for extra theta is counterproductive. Make your predictions as short term as possible, get maximum delta and gamma paying minimum premium; and close quickly if you were wrong."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. The demand for the model S and X according to daddy musk is extremely high. There was only 2k deliveries of those modes out of almost 185,000 units. Think about that for a second. They are refreshing those models and starting production on the new refreshed ones. Once those start full scale production these delivery numbers can go up another 50-65% with super high margin cars. This is bullish AF"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They announced they were temporarily stopping Model S production because they're preparing their factory floor to build the new model S sedans.....
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"They faked everyone out last week. 700c volume was insane, it expired at max pain. 

Now it's going flying this week after ya'll doubled down on puts"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you’re in TSLA for the next few years, you’ll be very happy"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,sentiments rarely matter lol. some hedge funds use sentiment analysis to trade against *favorable* sentiments and for a very good reason.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel this I normally only straddle meme stocks because of how wide the range can be. Hoping $TSLA  gaps down to 400 for you
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. Profits are higher in S/X than with 3. Downtrend is consistent across the board. Long term bullish, short term puts. I'll post my profits later this week"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"i was wondering why you didn't do a longer position, any news that sounds even slightly good and ppl will start buying tesla. sometimes nothing happens at all and it goes up."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of lingos, and I don’t understand your bingo language."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't be surprised to see a couple of good days but tesla always bounces up and down
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,First time for everything
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It has followed the curve most weeks. The odd week it has ended lower than the middle of pain. Last week it hit pain perfectly. So pain is around $640 if you observe the curve.  Another strat you can employ instead of closing your position is sell against it. if it opens Monday and is falling quickly you could sell 4 x $590 puts and collect that premium against your position. That is if you feel like you should hold but want some insurance against a sudden reversal higher.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Degiro (netherlands). Also tried signing up for trading 212, but the waitlist is too long; been sinds mid February."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. How many days till expiry was it, when you bought it?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"But you just lost 3 days of theta by holding over a holiday weekend on a weekly, so you need to be expecting a huge move by opening bell...or IV to go up tremendously"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Now you lost me twice. I don’t know either of these people. 🤦🏻‍♂️
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Your timing might prove more effective. We’ll see :)

I don't even have puts. But google isn't cooperating and I don't really believe you as of this moment."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"i'm guessing ""most automotive companies"" are the fully grown guys who expect small growth YOY. Tesla is the first actual growing automotive company that has made it to this stage (500k+ car a year) without dying since probably toyota or something."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"When they shut down production of the Model 3 a month ago, that I could buy as temporary.  ""Out of semiconductors, be back soon,"" fine.

The ""temporary"" shut down on Model S's and X's has been going on for a while now."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought on Thursday, so 8 DTE."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"IMO when making a directional bet you should prioritize higher delta even if it costs increased theta; heck, this is *why* it costs increased theta. I view the weekend theta burn as a fee to make the bet."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,wait what??? this weekend counts for 3 days of theta? how does theta decay when the markets arent open? sorry if it sounds like a dumb question.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s the ta gang??
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla was created by literally God himself. Look it up on your google bullshit
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Can confirm. 4Q is the hottest quarter for autos.  1Q they down the lines for 2-4 weeks for updates and maintenance  usually.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,shut up gay bear
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hm, I may be wrong then. I thought I read something near the time the the 1100hp version of the Model S was announced that they were going to halt the production line and install new machinery specifically for the Model S.   


My info may be out of date, or just straight up inaccurate lol"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Or it’s just a casual metaphor for the market action. You must be fun at parties.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good luck buddy, market is hella rarted right now"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Good to know. You don’t like leaps?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good luck, it does have a high delta, so if it does $10 at open you make up for the lost theta"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Theta is just a concept to explain how options decay per day.

Arguably you could say buyers of options recognize this 3 day weekend so they pay less for the options, effectively pricing in this gap and reducing theta cost."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fri, Sat, Sun

Theta decay happens even on weekends and holidays"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"🐻beary🌈assessment, fur sure"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So mature. I say $640 by end of week. What is your price target?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have not produced a single Model S or Model X since the factory shut down on December 12th.  Every single car produced in Q1 of this year has been a Model 3 or a Model Y, that's it.

I don't think they're just retooling their lines or something.  I think they literally do not have the semiconductors to run all of their production lines at once."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I find I’m more fun after a few beers.

As for these “just a joke” metaphors, I think bad thinking like this leads to QAnon type stuff. The meme seed sprouts into a retarded plant."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I found I never held my LEAPS longer than a few weeks anyways, if I'm short term trading there is no point to pay for the extra time (plus they have wider spreads, closer dated options have more liquidity).

LEAPS are good if you really believe in the company and are planning to buy and hold through ups and downs. Good places to buy LEAPS would have been on TSLA in 2018, on PRPL when the purple kings were posting about them, on GME when DFV called it out. I think LEAPS are for leveraging these buy and hold company plays. I'm still looking for my LEAP play.. I'm thinking maybe CRCT is the next PRPL, but CRCT really betrayed its customer base so idk now."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, yeah, I'm looking for 650 or below at open. If it's above 670 I'm rekt."

I am expecting Interim Phase 3 II results for Covaxin within the next trading week, from the timeline given in the above Pfizer example.

Covaxin plays an important role because it is one of the only vaccines that has been shown to have a high defense to current and potentially future mutations of the virus.

If anything I'm looking towards the drug treatment side of the COVID play for people who will still contract this before their vaccine kicks in or before they get a chance to get a vaccine.  


But more vaccines in play means more vaccines to the public which means a quicker return to normal."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's going to be boosters and mutations so I see them getting eua. Not to mention they use a different type of vaccine then others. They have a few great products they are working on in eye care also.

So, no way it doesn't get EUA."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm down 44% on this one with an average cost of $11.99. Some days I feel like a bag holder.  Some days I feel like I've got a mini $NVAX situation in my pocket.  Either way, post like these are encouraging. I'm hoping to just break even at this point with no desire for profit even.  Thanks for sharing."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If you dig deeper than surface level information you will see OCGN (Covaxin) has a lot to offer.  This would be the only EAU approved vaccine that is not mRNA besides J and J.  Edit.  If phase 3 data is favorable and it is EAU approved — we will have a runner!  The only issue that worries me is how big pharma does not want any competition.  I think it would be smart to approve — if the data is supportive and let the citizens choose which vaccine they want.  I’d love for this to happen next week!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks about right timing wise. What about the other vaccine companies though? How long did that take? Also did shareholders decide yet on dilution? That could drive the price down further near term, although it makes sense to dilute the shares to gain capital to bring this product to the US in large numbers."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I have some positions at around $6.5. Too lazy to look up how many exactly lol. But I do hope it rockets!

“Covaxin had reported an interim efficacy of 81 percent” which is less than Moderna and Pfizer and around J & J.

The efficacy is much higher than J&J, and lower than Moderna & Pfizer but regardless that isn't the play here. In the case you missed the title or any of the content of the post, you would realize that this is a **mutation play**. The listed above have shown to be less defensive across various different strains of the virus. 

The Brazil situation is annoying but if you know anything about Brazil their political system is sub par at best. I personally don't think it is all to do with the vaccine itself. There has been 5 countries to grant EUA already without any roadblocks, shown below.

Only Pfizer has any real lasting effect of those tested so far against variants, and is less effective than it is against the original virus strain. It is most likely similar to what Covaxin is/will show with the data about to be released. 

Next question, shorty? You aren't fooling any apes here."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's what it says."

2021-04-03 03:46:10,wallstreetbets,"The Massive Bull Case for X and other infrastructure stocks (X gon give it to ya) President Biden just released his [infrastructure plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/).  For those who don't want to read that honestly massive document TLDR, they intend to have probably the largest infrastructure improvement initiative since the New Deal.  Now President Biden and Secretary of Transportation Buttigieg are both on record as massive train nerds, and what do trains need to work?  They need rails, what are rails made of?  Steel.  Steel is also going to be used to repair all the bridges across the country so they stop being such a safety risk.

&#x200B;

So, what stocks are we talking about here?

&#x200B;

Obviously US Steel (Ticker $X) is going to see a large increase in demand.  This stock has already seen a very large increase in the last year, and you can even get it at a slight discount after yesterday.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6h71ly0dhuq61.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a7fb892abed5330853e590836ee1bd2a12e50a

Similarly, Concrete is going to have a huge demand boost for improving bridges and other infrastructure.  US Concrete (Ticker $USCR) has seen a similar boom to X, and is also discounted after yesterday.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bf9prq94iuq61.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=4177421c9042908fafbe7401dde0d7277798342f

Then if we want to get into roads we will need asphalt and gravel, so let's take a look at Vulcan Materials ($VMC).  Just like the other stocks they dipped a bit yesterday so buy the dip.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0qwisy6sjuq61.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=a97858a1131f765e98384a2c71b1c72c57e645b1

There are a lot of other construction materials companies, but most of them are under 1 B market cap so I can't mention them here.

&#x200B;

Positions, I bought 20 shares of X on wednesday, also holding 120 GME, 100 UWMC, and 10 RIDE.  Going to buy shares and monthly calls on these stocks on monday.

Edit: specified positions.  Also, after looking into it further, CLF is probably also a good play"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Up vote for the DMX reference
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The last major federal infrastructure infusion came from ARRA, and it took years to spend that money.  Infrastructure bills sound great, but the typical strings that make federal dollars impossible to spend quickly still apply.  Projects get bogged down in federal red tape from the outset.  There should be no expectation of quick infrastructure work happening out of any federal bill.

But that is the real world, and it doesn't mean there isn't a financial play here.  The vast majority of people aren't versed in the nuance of federal construction dollars and will look to invest quickly, even though the actual material sales increase is years away.  

There is scarcity right now though.  We received a material quote one afternoon a few weeks ago that got pulled by the supplier first thing the next day because of a major steel price increase that morning.  I've never seen that happen before in our industry.

This might be more of a steady longer term play, with supply problems driving up prices now and demand keeping them up in a few years when this money is spent.  There could be a quick money play if you can time the infrastructure bill announcement correctly, but I'm not nearly good enough at this to try myself."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Own 8000 shares, let's go!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like CAT (and maybe to a lesser extent DE) would be the plays here.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The comparison to FDR is ridiculous. The infrastructure funding is woefully inadequate. It is 1/3 of what he campaigned on and will get watered down even more... if it gets passed at all.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Trying to get new gme mania wsb to care about anything else is a waste of time fam

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe I'll do dd on where the money is going
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I completely disagree.  I think the market expected an infrastructure plan that had a lot more basic materials outlays in it than what Biden released.  I think everything you're saying was already priced in and then some.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The DMX reference seems like a strange premonition in hindsight
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah you are pretty late to the party
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe Chinese steel companies go brrrr
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would agree with you ONLY if the $2 trillion dollars was actually going to infrastructure. Only 5% of the $2T is going to infrastructure with the rest being union payoffs or some shit (but that IS $100B). Plus demand for concrete and steel is not immediate, it would take years for the federal government and state governments to plan any upgrades."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where infrastructure needs to be built you can guarantee you'll need cranes. $CR $5.5B mkt cap price $95 49mil float 1% short, 528k short interest, 1.8% div"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You really ought to read it.  Less than 30% actually goes to infrastructure.  Reminds me of an $845B ""infrastructure"" bill in 2012 for shovel ready jobs that weren't.  Still waiting to find out where all that taxpayer money really went."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve got June calls for steel, not in X tho. Regardless of  how long this plan takes to go into effect steel is in high demand, lower supply and the prices have been steadily rising. Every call I have expires in June because I don’t know what lifting the eviction/mortgage moratorium is going to do to the economy and I don’t trust it."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds great, not banking on politicians doing what they say they're gonna do. 

But Biden's in bed with warren buffet, I'd consider whatever Buffet's doing is safe, albeit not WSB worthy."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"A construction project manager (concrete and rebar). Lost of materials are bought offshores. There was a big issue with China dumping steel not more than 4 years ago. Materials are bought from all over, Mexico included. These projects are giving to the lowest bidder. That bidder then buys from the lowest cost supplier. Anyhow.. US steel may go up slightly, after planning (could take years), permits and drawings (could take years), after city official invites from general contractor to dinner and sporting events in efforts to influence their bid, then after this the US steel market will be countered by foreign material. This would need anti dumping efforts and shutting out foreign steel trade to see the spike you’re hoping for.
Sorry Op I’m neither bull nor bear in this. The money will just go to the contractors they choose. I haven’t dug into it myself, but my brother in law mention (as I read here as well ) the bill is not solely for infrastructure, lots of other things get put into bills, like raises..."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The price of steel has literally doubled since August 2020. Demand is strong on all fronts. There is a worldwide shortage for shipping containers. Scheduled shipping is in a terrible state. They don’t know when containers will be picked up or unloaded. There’s a shortage of truck drivers. The chip shortage has severely impacted the steel sector as well. Lumber is through the roof, as well as copper. PVC is on allotment. Right now is the absolute worst time to build, but it’s going strong!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The time to buy infrastructure stocks for a quick flip was 2 weeks ago, I bought in about 20 different tickers, steel, copper, iron, concrete, home builders, canadian timber and pretty much everything shot up 10-25% last week. There was some pullback on thursday but  US steel went from 19.50-26 in a week so that was to be expected. I bought these all as long holds because the price of building materials is skyrocketing because of supply chain issues so the market will be strong for some time , especially with a housing shortage since a lot couldnt get built last year due to covid."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I doubt they will source from China, even with the higher costs of producing domestically, if they are going for job creation, this is going to help their numbers in the upper midwest.  Also, tensions with China are pretty high so that is another point against buying from them."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls on China for me 😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,this money is federal instead of most infrastructure money which is state level.  I figure the federal government is going to be pretty protectionist especially since a lot of steel manufacturing is done in the upper midwest and Biden certainly doesn't want to lose any of those states in the next two elections.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,this isn't flaired as DD
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn't dd
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I got burned so hard yesterday too.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,X dumps on all good news as do most steel stocks have you never been vitarted r/vitards
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,X will come back.  That was people taking profits on Thursday before the long weekend
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you first hand, it doesn't get expedited. There's not really a way to actually expedite it even if you wanted to. Transportation construction is a slow process."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Government, and quick..... I see you’ve never at all worked anywhere near the government or federal government. These are dog and pony shows. Oh we signed a huge amount of money, then expense reports, EIS’s, prioritization, oh we need money, let’s dip into the fund we signed for infrastructure because of an emergency tsunami hurricane tornado earthquake happen... See we’ve done this for years, and it’s why every administration promises more for infra. But just like everyone else, shit ain’t happening. Also, trains are a joke, a major waste of money, check out California, way over budget and not anywhere near or ever will complete. Infra is not sexy, and doesn’t sell well. Manned mission to Mars would sell so much more"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty wild. 🙏🏽🙏🏽
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought in 2 weeks ago big on infrastructure/materials and it paid off well, at this point its probably a little late to jump in for a quick profit as things havent pulled back too much yet, I think these will all be solid long term plays regardless, the supply of lumber and steel is never going to get larger and the demand is unlikely to get smaller in our lifetimes."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you’re honest-ish. TLDR of Government TLDR
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape? Now this play makes sense
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess my bigger point is they pull the trend up and say “oh up whatever% in the last 3 months it’s priced in” and have no idea about the current steel market or commodities in general. Respect for posting in here though.

You should keep up with r/vitards for steel gang info tho"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check out r/vitards WSB banned the original DD writer for ""market manipulation"". Turns out he was 100% right."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a highway contractor I can tell you that Chinese steel is strictly prohibited on federal projects. I am required to use American steel only.

Edit: Here’s a [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_America_Act) to the piece of legislation that requires American steel."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol dude this is Xiden we're talking about. Get real.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Positions?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t say I have
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eh, it will but I think I was wrong to think X would get a boost from the infrastructure bill. Like others have said that money is years away from making it to these companies."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually work as an air force contractor.  I know exactly how slow that sort of stuff goes.  I was just hoping that other more public areas with a bit more public view might move a bit faster.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I read all that in a condescending Psaki voice! (try it too!)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not so sure this admin is into moving slowly.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chinese steel is shit, that's why."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That's good news then
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,dont know if you've been paying attention to the news but he hasnt been hitting it out of the park on us-china relations so far.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not OP, but I sold a 1DTE $27P, got assigned at 25ish, with 0.88 of credit but I'm not too stressed, one or two weeks and I'll get those bags taken away.
I have another 5/21 $22P that I'll most likely close at 50% profit."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell at the ding ding ding on Monday morning. Use the 26% that’s hopefully left to by some new contracts of something else and nail a 400% profit to get squared up

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Just hold
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Contact the seller at r/thethagang and ask for a refund.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So cool to see this. I have been selling AMC options and wondering who was buying them. Junk bond status, diluted shares, short squeeze happened, more shares coming to market, theaters have yet to open in my city, boss takes big pay bonus. Here is what I can suggest. Get rid of this option and start selling Bearish Call Spreads in AMC and start making that money back. One day the debt holders will take over the company and the shareholders will get $0.00"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You should keep starring at it daily as a reminder not to waste your $ on AMC buy calls
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have 50k in amc and am very bullish....with that being said.....any momentum in the 10...$12 range ......anything with a small loss sell immediately and buy stock.

This is very very volatile"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,💎✊ 😂😂😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Average down if u can than sell or hold up to you.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you asked for a refund?9
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Meh.... It could happen....
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly? I wouldn't see the point in selling for a loss. The capital has already been spent, I'd wait it out and see.

Not financial advice"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Prayers help sometimes
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Cry?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Watch it expire worthless in 2 weeks
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ride to zero then do it again the following week
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Not buy options
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You should buy more
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Not getting to 14 by 4/16 sadly.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,sacrifice ur first born to appease the market gods or sell that shit the first chance u get
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I would call the manager.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d unload it at the first sign up upward momentum

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Go watch Monkee vs Godzilla and forget about it.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's still worth nearly 2k. Dump it. *Probably* should have dumped earlier, but that's in the past. Bad plays happen, and if you hold on to this one it's just going to keep bleeding until there's nothing left.

If you're *absolutely* confident that the price is going up, or you *absoluetly* must stick this position out, look into ""rolling"" the call. You sell this one and use the money to buy one at a later expiry. That will cost money, *but* if you've got advanced options approval (which RH hands out like candy) you'll be able to sell a shorter term call to offset the price. Worst case scenario you have to put up a bit more capital as extra collateral to do the sell, but you get that back if you don't get assigned.

Actually, worst case scenario is that there's a huge spike up past the short leg of your new calendar spread and it blows up the whole position, but unless you stuff up the setup big time you shouldn't be out more than you stand to lose on the 16th anyway."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been down 80-90% on an option because someone decided to sell off a ton right after I bought, one choice is to sell right away and accept the small loss, other option is to weather the storm and hope it rolls back big. In my case, I find out in 2 weeks. Good luck"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Guh
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you considered looking for a time machine?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell it and fast.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cry, but cry knowing this is particularly AMCs fualt lol.

When they got the meme stock boost.

All AMC did with the investment is not close down and give its Ceo a bonus.

Meanwhile GME is over there making actual money moves bringing its core value up."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell and buy GME
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold obviously
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly... I'd sell it and either stay out or buy in another call expiring much later. Probably a 9 or 10 call would be more reasonable now
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Exercise it.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Roll it over to June 16th. Using the credits you currently have.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It could still go up, although to $14.50 by Apr. 16th at the rate things have been going at - In my overly optimistic-opinion is like 75% not gonna happen(Someone else said 99.99%, but I made 25k from $789 on GME calls in FEB. I've been through so much in life though, I don't discount anything happening. No one knows what could happen, but it sucks the call contract value decays everyday it doesn't happen and rumors going around that they possibly manipulate AMC price... \[Call debit spreads = No theta decay? Gonna go look more into more strats. :x\]) Not impossible, though. You can use the remaining capital to day trade spy(What I hear are the least expensive contracts with the most frequent expiration dates) to ensure safety with some nice gains. (What i'll do if some of my long calls start to bust.) 1.5k (I always overshoot losses and your calls, like mine, may be worth lower come Monday) is still quite a bit of money to day-trade SPY with. If it's the last of your capital, you may want to consider getting out even more. If you still have other money to work with, maybe you can hold - as I'm doing with some May AMC calls. The sensible thing would still be to pull out capital asap and put it into something a little more under your control / that you're more confident with.

After making 40k over the last 3 months starting with 6k and now being at 4k, learned a lot. Including borrowing other's money, buying calls, being careful about what and how you share investing advice, understating gains/losses or not telling people at all - especially while it's unrealized gain/loss, etc. I've only been trading since Nov. 2020. Now I assume all calls or going to expire worthless, and only put money in there that I swear i'm going to lose. I still look at this as my career, but investing in  cr. ip to.  and holding stocks long-term, I think imma have to do at this rate, lmfao... And day trading spy for the rest of the year(along with some other etf's I have my eyes on I.E: SOXL. Still have some wild GME calls expiring as late as apr. 16. >.< Probably all lost money. Hopefully i'm done losing money after 6 months of investing, really wish I would have just saved 20k when I was up 40k 3 weeks ago. Gonna go learn spreads / strangle/straddle/butterfly/condor in like 20 min. unless one of my friends wants to game for a little...

Anywho, I have a $10 amc call expiring Apr.9. I personally think AMC is overshorted and could shoot up anytime. I think I heard may 4th may be an amc share recall - but don't you dare hold me to it. I have AMC calls going late into May, but they may all expire worthless. I hope DTCC rules and all we've been through creates more of a truly free market. Anyways..."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How can you squeeze AMC shorts if AMC will sell them shares any time the price goes up?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What exactly is the long thesis here?  How can you squeeze shorts if AMC is willing to issue infinity shares the moment the stock hits $15?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,it’s easy to easy. but once you use a real broker you realize how little robinhood has to offer except easy to maneuver with a few clicks

Who tries to flex on the strength of Robinhood? Or any brokerage for that matter?  

Believe in yourself Joe.  You don’t have to go around shitting on popular opinion to feel superior.  I’m sure you have lots to offer if you just be yourself.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never seen anyone feel this strongly about any trading flat form. Either way I guess it makes sense, when you put your market order in and you don’t get the best pricing you can just blame the platform and not yourself. When the stock you bought doesn’t do 200% in the same day you can always blame the hedges for manipulating it. Make a post about how XYNZ stock has some squeeze potential without understanding what that even means what what a short interest means.

Your first paragraph was about the mother. Your second  paragraph was about defending yourself. Your third Paragraph what about hating Robinhood. Your fourth paragraph was about the father. 

In a way you truly represent everything I despise. Bandwagon into hating your platform, and then start insulting build a persons family. In a sub where we joke about self deprecating humor, you may have hard time fitting in with that much of an ego.

Find some self responsibility and stop blaming on others for your own failures."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not a  Bull Put Spread ?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha wow this is fucking retarded I love it good work ape
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m holding shares @600. Hope this will work out for both of us 🤞

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you're gonna be very happy next week
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If you uninstall- then you lost nothing. Good plan- big brain style.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Theta’s gonna be a bitch on this one good luck bröther
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Since option sellers make the vast majority of money it’s a wonder that there is a market for buyers other than those who are aware of mergers before public announcement.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok now i am going to short this baby to the ground! I am calling Melvin!
Hahah nah I am kidding man! 
I really believe you got high chances it will hit it! Market looked good again for tech"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Brah, no. You’ll lose most of this, but you don’t have to lose all of it. Sell calls against your position. You won’t post any gain porn if this moons, but you’ll live to make another stupid buy."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn serious question. Because I have a 7 figure account and I would NEVER throw money like this on weekly calls. What kind of account balance do you have to make bets like this ? Im extremely curious.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Watch out for 713. That has been some big time resistance in the last month.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,These will print np
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,you'll loose it all mt friend
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally cannot go tits up.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s a bet all right. The most exciting trade one can make is a fuckin weekly LOL!!!!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahaha you could have covered your eyes with a bandana and go for a car ride on the highway, you would have a better chance, godspeed guy"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"i feel sick reading your post. my stomach is turning right now. wow 150,000k i think is going to trash bro. even with all this negative nasdaq sentiment."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Remindme! in 7 days
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a question what would happen if 107k shares in tesla would be sold in one shot. How much would the price on the stock drop?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Balls of steel. I hope it works out for you!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you ask from your wife's boyfriend's father?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok sounds good

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I forsee great printing
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I think prepared to get rich 😁
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSLA gonna make you rich again 
Make wsb great again"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got 900c 6/16. Pick me up on the way, will ya?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If only you bought these when Tesla was at 600 last week
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is a call may i ask, i understand puts, but i have never understood calls."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Best of luck, deliveries were good so it might just work out"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is how I become millionaire...

started as billionaire and lost...then millionaire and even more down... (closing to ground zero)

Good job..."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,**** SEC has entered the chat
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You lost more than my annual salary.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you ever do with your baba jan 300c?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice those bad.boys are gonna print.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,so stupid. shouldve just bought an amg g wagon and driven it off a cliff
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you're going to lose all your money, but godspeed to you for making WSB great again."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,after the GameStop fiasco it lost half its volume and hasn’t regained it yet. I expect that to change this week and pass that 700$ resistance with ease.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whatever happens, we get gain porn of loss porn.

Thank you for your service!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I am a noob. How do I be like you?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,F
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"With the positive delivery numbers, this might actually pay out.  Might... market has a strange way of screwing over big bets by small players."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t get this
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I only have enough to buy 20 of these contracts. Might yolo and ride or die with you lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"will probably buy this on open on monday, or do you think it’s a bad choice?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m here w u. 3 4/9 650c, 3 4/30 665c, 5 9/16/22 420c"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This about to print IMO fuck! Good luck bro 🚀🚀
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla was my first stock that I ever bought. Lost $$$$$ but thats when I learnt how to stock. Made the gains back with GME and MARA. Good luck.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Does your money grow from a tree?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,this is ... risky.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you need support, will pick up contracts on monday"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is it always weeklies. At the very least go 3weeks out
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets, remindme! 4/9
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no words.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,NOW THATS A YOLO WORTH JACKING OFF TO
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 6k in puts for 4/23 and honestly I'd be okay with losing that 6k if it means you make millions cause this is a legendary yolo!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Gl! Tesla is too volatile for me. Playing Tesla through ARKK.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,God speed. Hopefully it pays off. Great news about deliveries so hopefully stock shoots up premarket.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Youll be good
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,And I thought that me shorting NSDQ100 was a stupid idea....
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,*retard
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,thats pretty optimistic
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn that’s a big buy for both of you guys. I bought 6 4/30 700c. I won’t make anywhere near the gamma returns you guys will but cheers to Monday and the delivery beat. 

What was your main driver to buy so heavily? Was it expectation of beating deliveries or just a down day body fill on Thursday’s candle or just plain gambling let’s yolo on Tesla this week?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, much smarter to buy two weeks out. Good for you for being relatively more diligent with your funds."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla’s technicals tell me those will print. Unless a larger market correction hits. Tesla is about to break up out of this channel.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,To the writer yeah.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm betting against
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Right. Talk of GME outside of a GME thread should result in ban. Fuck GameStop for ruining WSB. Not a hater just getting tired of being unable to find anything else with n00bs posting gain charts of 1000-3000 like we’re supposed to be impressed.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like, better than a 50% loss well?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Want to buy a few more?""









-Theta Gang"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't worry when you YOLO a big amount once they will all just be numbers.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla can even do almost a 20% in a day.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"maybe, maybe not. 180k production is not a guaranteed rise in stock price"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk what that is
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why a put spread instead of a bull call spread? He's buying calls already
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good EV news from others I’ve noticed hurts TSLA stock price. Remember TSLA was like only EV play for years. I think a lot of TSLA monies are being dispersed to other EVs like QS, NIO, GOEV, RIDE, WKHS 

That being said I am a TSLA Bull good luck, I may join Monday if I can"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,thats my  first thought
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lucky one that got them here with a few gamble that paid off big. You have too much money to understand. When you get into options with 5k and suddenly it goes to 25000 from a good entry on tesla or Nio before the last secondary, you get hooked. 

It happened to me many times over the past year with huge winners and after thinking I know how to handle weeklies switch from monthlies then begin over trading and poor risk management kicks in and you give it all back. A few survive long enough to get to high levels and when it goes south they often lose it all or 80+% on one week. Crazy but I’ve been through all phases of greed success and guilt, followed by much more discipline and higher success. 

I switched to intraday scalping primarily and swinging on massive down days and only play 30+ days out and usually 40+ and I feel like I have a groove now."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Inverse this for tendies
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,He's a retard. What's this ape talk - I thought that was just GME
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla sold off for FUD for deliveries not some dumb fantasy about GME. You probably think this sub has the power to move a 600b company. Wake up man.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You apparently don’t understand markets. This isn’t how it works.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Only one of us can be right!

Why is this? What's the correlation between SPY and TSLA?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a final hail mary on your puts. Hope it doesn't expire worthless.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes that is how options work
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,He can sell at the open for any gap up like he said he would for a significant gain due to IV and gamma ramping up. That’s his plan anyway did you read?

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You will lose with those delivery numbers depending on the expiration.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,don't attach numbers to real world value. once it's in here it's just a score. 100% gains on 10k or 100k cost gives the same dopamine rush
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Contract to buy 100 shares at the strike price, so in this case the option seller is selling the right to op to buy 100 shares for $700 ea + premium"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It means you spend so much time chasing stonks and giving away money that your wife acquired a boyfriend while you are graphing and averaging up or down. 

Also, sometimes he loans you money for letting him bang."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I just did and I feel like you may be a retarded genius
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"youre a true retard king amongst retards, this is the shit we love to see"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is only something to check, if we had a camera on you too 24/7 since your birth, since you might have other accounts that are a complete failure.

This is what one of the other posts is about: being able to check positions, the lack of which could mean the death of the sub at some point.

If you really bought this, you certainly have balls. I think TSLA is hugely overvalued and only exists to make Elon Musk rich (and perhaps options traders)."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You have some fuckin schnuts holding Tesla calls through a 3 day weekend. Hope it works out
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"> What I've learned with TSLA is never become attached and hold on too long. If you see an opening, get out because there's more chance to get in lower and give you more time/room. Holding on to hope is what kills most trades

Reads last line of original post. Amazing"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it gaps up to 700-720, unload at least your cost basis so you don’t have complete fomo, Godspeed retard"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think Monday opens red than a bounce up to mid week, then another sell off to 600."

QFT!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,When 7 figure gamble pays off and it still isnt enough lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,True. My cost averaging buys are around $705/share so I was shitting bricks last month but I held on to hope lol. Easy to buy Tesla on emotions (high) and sell when down.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You just described every Apple option I own and now watching expire worthless
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I've gotten better at swing trading tsla this year. Last year i got burned. When are you exiting your position?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The down day when the market popped made me buy on anticipation deliveries would meet since Elon never disappoints
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I was looking at the 800 4/30 as a great way to Lambo or Bridge
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I love you
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,and did you buy 150k worth of weeklies?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's quite the change in tune out of you.

>Well, that’s too bad. I called the top at $880 sold my shares, then have ridden it down watching TA continue to tell me there’s more room to bleed. $500 is currently strong support but strong support can quickly fall with a larger market fall. It’s traders like you that remind me heavily of the tech bubble. Sees something run up thousands of percentage points and thinks there’s more to come. **There’s further downside. Much further.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf6rfl/generoustreetbets/gsm5az8/

Fucking kill me"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So fucking glad I can find other people that share my opinion of GME lol.I respect your gamestonk play, now please shut the fuck up about it. It's been a constant for 10 weeks."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This and also short squeezes it’s so painful to read
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla will likely go up Monday
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,it did 20% in a day last week or the week before
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. Toast bread (bread becomes toast!)
2. Spread bull cum on toast
3. ???
4. Profit"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate the insight. Obviously I take large risks, and I want to make a quick $1M profit, but I can’t bring myself to buying $100K worth of call options. I’d rather sell $10M worth of put exposure than buy just $10K in weekly calls. I always look for it though. Maybe one day it will stand out"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think limiting yourself to only playing a small percentage of your portfolio on these risky bets seems reasonable. I've been limiting myself to using around 5% on risky options and am glad for it.

I know where I am tho, yall want 1000% gains not 20% and godspeed to you. I'm neutral on TSLA but I like ARKK so I hope this prints big."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape compliment ape to make ape feel less retarded
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe the rising yield and chip shortage was the bigger reason.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. I'm expecting a spike Monday from those delivery numbers and a good run to 750 at some point next week. At which point I can close out my 4/16 620/640 bull spread for max profit. If I were holding those 700 calls I'd sell them in batches starting at 730 or so in case it keeps running.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,you apparently don't understand how beta works nor do you have any clue just how much HFs shorted GME
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,TSLA is part of S&P 500 SPY is etf of S&P
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The probability of both TSLA going to 700 and for SPY to drop to 391 is very low.. It's possible but very unlikely.. He's basically aggressively betting the market to go up while I'm betting the market is gonna  aggressivevely drop next week
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't buy puts. Buy Credit Spreads. Thanks for asking. Puts decline in value in time. Credits grow in time so long as the stock trades sideways or flat. No hailmary this time.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If I had retard strength like you I could’ve gotten 21 of my calls instead of 6 long dated ones. I can’t do it after losing so much on weeklies I’m 3+ weeks out for life from now on.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is so funny how WSB and options in general, warps your mind. Until you have to tell your significant other it seems like such a game. I want more points on my 6 700c 4/30 I bot late afternoon. 

Cheers. Let’s get it. Gap up over 700 please and sell at the open."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This mother fucker can't figure out why he's broke. You can't live the jealous life let your wife have her sugar daddy and reap the benefits.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,lol at being so worried about paying taxes that you don't try to make money
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re right, I’m going to quit my job because I have to pay taxes on my salary, bigly beautiful brain"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Do it in your IRA. It's tax protected.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought the 800 4/9s at close. 4/30 is an eternity to wait!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The volatility we’ve been seeing is its effort to finish out this descending wedge. High volatility once it reaches its corner.

Dickhead loves to pretend his technicals can predict until they don't and then he pretends they can predict the other way."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay I’ll explain. Here’s the situation:

[S&P 500 100 year. 1990 Dot com top vs us now.](https://imgur.com/a/U5gqofm)

[Tesla’s channel](https://imgur.com/a/UfJwMzk)

An ascending triangle can still stay close to the lower half, or go through the middle or move through the top very bullishly. But it could follow another bearish move.

See what I’m saying? Tesla has been on a massive bull run channel to expand its over all channel. Movement is unpredictable in general.... but, the overall market topping out would be pretty bearish for everything. Tesla can break up or down pretty soon here."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, he's the first one to say the letters. Everybody here knows what ""new WSB"" means."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You are aware of the fact that TSLA has been attacked by hedgies ?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone in for killing a 🐧?

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, it looks so likely It's basically guaranteed to do the opposite."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds more reasonable than this trade.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What's with the weird baby talk?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Chip shortage worried the investors that inventory numbers wouldn't get hit. And they did.

A comment ago the calls were going to print because of the technicals.

Now, with that comment? Well it might go up or it might go down, because of the technicals. 

You can throw more graphs and lines at the take, it doesn't change the fact you're not as sure or accurate as you claim to be."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why? I thought they beat production numbers?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,True...   I wonder if they will later revise the 50% YOY expectation? Or maybe it grows with the Semi truck coming end of year? Thoughts?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great. And with that you can predict the stock price? If so, you are a certain winner in this market. Wish I could say that a stock is going higher after it already went higher when good news hits the tape. I say it goes lower, you say it does what? That is all I care about ,, getting the direction of the stock price. I don't make money on what they deliver, only on the trade."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How much profit did Tesla make on each sale? Maybe you can convince me I'm wrong as this turned out to be a windfall.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I sell overhead bearish spreads. Why? TSLA premium is very high and this enough profit for me. Sideways or down = winning trade. Thanks for the love! Cheers.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I forget exactly. The 2023 was something like 14k for the one option.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This news is not bullish. This was already known to everyone. The number fell inside the consensus estimates.  if they printed 220,000 or something then it would be a holy shite moment. Find out soon enough. I have no position in the stock ahead of this as we aren't 100% sure how the market will react. Buying and selling of shares by the public nor public sentiment moves this stock. I've watched it overnight. Traded by an algo pair. This combined with setting huge premium in the options. This stock is a big money maker for those running it."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://imgur.com/a/PLRdbjm


Because I started looking at SPY more I said that. You don’t understand. Look at the 100 year chart. A market correction is supposed to be happening soon. That’s why I said that it would go down. Tesla’s bullish channel & a possible bearish channel are two scenarios that can exist at the same exact time. Should I be so sure if I think the market is going to correct soon? Probably. I guess we’ll see."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re claiming you can predict the stock price too
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock wont go up until they make a profit? That's a very short sighted and uninformed take. I suggest you read the whole Ark invest's 1500-4000$ valuation analysis.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"> I sell overhead bearish spreads.

Can you give an example of a spread you bought ?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You mean 1.4k right? Otherwise your breakeven at expiry is like $2,700."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"it’s not a loss if you ignore it, all problems can be solved this way"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't make bets one month out. Let's see whose closer after 1 week. I bet Tesla finishes $710 end of week.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,!remind me 1 month

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Traded it for 10 years.  I'm never 100% right .. Is trading not predicting the price movement of a stock? Is there another better way to make money in the market without making a prediction? Please share as I'm keen to make coin.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock went up from what to where? The stock went up already. Now it is in a downtrend until it is not.  $420 is my target .. maybe I'm wrong. Maybe koo koo Kathie is wrong.  What is your short term target. I trade by the weeks not the years.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Last spread I bought was 2 contracts of Selling the $700 and Buying the $705 Calls ... Paid $190 credit each. They expired and I kept the $380. I'm not a big gambling type so took no position before the delivery announcement. Same for earnings. I will look at the price action tomorrow and decide what spread to take.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I mean it was listed on the brokerage for ~140 meaning my out of pocket was $14k."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll say $640.  No big rip and no big crash this week in my opinion.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Adjust this to 1 week. They are wagering on EOW.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, you think TSLA in 2 years will be worth more than Amazon is worth today?"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Well he used remind me wrong so there’s nothing to adjust lol

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,interesting hmmm
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Good news = dip = buying opportunity
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Just did another Shadow of War play through... I'm never going to escape it will I...
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe this will get the hedgies out of their short positions  🩳🚫
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I love it!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Std 3% dip on any other day...but I was unfaithful and decided to pick up pennies selling calls, so PLTR will punish me by mooning on this news and never looking back."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They better make a profit this time
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Neat.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,TO THE MOON RETARDS
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow... this is like Accenture style contracts
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,BUY THE DIP!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Dated April 1. Use your own discretion.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So puts on PLTR it is..  The fuck?  With this market does that mean anything?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What am I supposed to do?!?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,yay more corporate communism
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll prepare my account for the dip, then."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Already sold my PLTR for gme because it went down every positives news.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,LFGGGG
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,O believe it's undervalued.  A darn esiganture platform lime docu is worth more SMH.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Great. Means palantir is down 3% on Monday.  Will load my stimulus chexk Tuesday past lunch pls keep track of my gains
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s incredible that that a story that isn’t about GME is so high on the front page. The apes must be off in the forest.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Priced in
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,LISTEN. YOU DUMB FUCKING CIRCUS ANIMALS THIS IS A BUY AND HOLD. STOP LOOKING AT IT EVERY DAY.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m contacting Joe Biden about this contract. I think they’re having late night jerk sessions behind the the wife’s back. Who is the real wife’s boyfriend???? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,1 trillion market cap in no time 😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, you must own High Tide."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop I can only get triggered so much
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know if I’m just a gullible idiot or is there actually a way to come up with the ~~~percentage changes~~~ shares value predictions based on the market cap, volume, revenues, debt, etc? It’s been a long time since I’ve taken a financial class"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is already priced in.. lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,GUHHHH PLTR Y R U LIKE DIS
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking hate how you're right.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"yep, I have some cash ready for this dip"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy the dip
Fill the gap
Then
Enjoy that math"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why dip? They won a contract, is a good news, isn't it?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just 3% dip? Boy, you are an optimist."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I see you're a man of taste as well.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,El Oh El
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oughta be real solid for my 4/8 $29 CSPs

F."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I just put in 100 dollars on this one in new to this shy advice please
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn't Nokia.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know!  Right?  I believe in this company and I think it has incredible potential, so I have been holding onto it.  But, my God....I've been in the red for so damn long!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The 89M is already priced in
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a $7m contract, with a potential to be $89M. So I guess actual would be something like -0.41%"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m sure Citadel will make sure this happens haha
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA I was looking for this comment
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, 89M is chump change, and the stock is absurdly overvalued."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a tiny tiny contract. It means nothing. I work on one of these contracts and net margin is very low. They’ll take home a wapping 5-10% of the contract value in profit.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Big* dip
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, I should have sold this shit yesterday. Ugh, red Mondays here we go again."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell puts
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since they’re priced for $50B in contracts, what do you expect?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s been forgotten and price dropped 3% as a result
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Analysts weren’t worried about government contracts though. Palantir needs non govt
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is market open on Monday, on account of Easter Monday?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,CEO selling off tons of shares will get more news.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally. In the money.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Time to buy the dip, I guess😭"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,12% gains over the next 78 years? I'm doubling down my position on Monday!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. This is a good one.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean if they split 7 times between now and 2099, then, yeah, I can see this."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Investors brace for an imminent correction
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"A Palantír is a dangerous tool, Saruman."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its 89 million...the market cap is 39 BILLION. So, maybe 1% increase in value, if the company is actually worth $39 billion. 

Not poo pooing Palantir, I just think it was kind of like Tesla when it started to go big here, and overvalued. The hype could bring it up big on Monday before going back down."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not that it’s weird, the company burns through Cash, bad money management"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm so down on that and roblox..got them when they ipod thought I was getting ahead of the game..and fuck no lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If you are really looking for something that dips on good new go with BB ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"89m in government contracting and for a company the size of pltr is literally nothing, not even worth considering... It's a drop in the bucket.

You guys really cling to anything to confirm that bias huh?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tbh, it's up 100% on the year. At that rate, they will have all the money in the world in 10 years."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"buy the rumor, sell the news."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It will make sense in 291 days when it is revealed how over leveraged in shorts this stock was. See you in January.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That's like 89 ferraris or 178 football fields wtf
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like the only people paying $40 at that point would be WSB.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Mama Cathie can bring you to the promised land!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to make sweet tender love to Cathie Wood.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah shit p gonna drop 50% on Monday
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The PLTR hype-men will completely ignore that. And also question why PLTR price is not increasing.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah I see you too are a student of ""are there any numbers besides 4?""."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The dollar amount of this contract wouldn't even affect the decimal points of serious deals being thrown around by the market heavyweights.  Now, let's take a glance at PLTR's market cap..."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Big data crunching for domestic and international surveillance.  Palantir was the name of the all-seeing eye from LOTR.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Better not to ask.. I just keep dumping my cash in. Shoot now ask questions later sort of deal.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Good news is the price will take a massive shit ayer anything good happens.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Umm wouldn’t you be happy to just get rid of this shiii lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which covered call did you sell? My 23s just expired today thank God, the stock closed at $23.07 and they didn't call the stock from me
Because the aftermarket was $25.98
How far out did you sell?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s literally every tech companies.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Let’s go !
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why??
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Aug $25 here.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So you're saying they're overpriced?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you even talking about?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean GME was cute but don't be surprised when the people YOLOing 5- and 6-figure bets are actually trash humans
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How are they burning cash?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The also have a 300 million dollar contract with the army.BTW tell me one soft startup that gets those kind of contracts.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this satire or can you show us how PLTR is being shorted to oblivion? Lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Investing in that hoping to profit?  Good luck, they always go over budget.  Could make good loss porn though."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Who are those software companies winning billion dollar contracts from the U.S government except MSFT?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a meme that PLTR falls on good news.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Show us on this stick drawing where the bad PLTR touched you.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"First of all it's not a small contract and your logic is very weird. That is like saying why is  business x paying Microsoft only 100k for using their software and services, aren't they a big company."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Then buy the dip until it rip
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a meme, in the past 2 months PLTR dropped from 45 to 23 dollars. The stock is still up more than 100 percent since DPO."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy the rumor, sell the news. A financial industry tale as old as Buffet"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What strike and expiry?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully Puts
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, but I am high on Tide."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Both of you, get out of my portfolio!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Amen brothur
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I can relate to this
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I KNEW the position of the moon affected the price of PLTR! 🌊🌗🚀
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, this is just PLTR. The consistently announce new contracts from 40-100M and it's always a 1-5% dip. Good news never seems to help. Probably still recovering from being a meme stock, but it's so much more than that."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Butter the rumor sell the news
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact you even know those classes exist mean that youre not cut out for this subreddit
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short answer is yes. Wall Street people are interssted in the intrinsic value of stocks to determine whether the current price is undervalued or not. This is what they used in their decision whether to long or short. In corporate finance, there are 2 methods in computing this: first model depends heavily on current and projected dividends, while the second model depends on what we call Free Cash Flows."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"EPS Earnings Per Share is what you need to calculate.

Once you've done that then you use the current P/E (multiple) to determine potential new share price"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"With 1.82 Billion shares, the gross impact of an $89 Million contract is about 4.9 cents per share. I don’t know what their profit margin is with the contract, but most companies run a fairly thin margin of 10% or less, so expect somewhere less than 1/2 cent per share impact. Essentially negligible news, in other words. Full disclosure: I am long PLTR with both shares and options."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm very new to this but from what I gathered you can't ever predict the share values movement. However contract winner news like this, plus high volume is apparently a good indicator of a stock going up at some point in the next few days"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not for anything that's traded here, there isn't."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the rumor sell the news. If they're announcing the contract the hype is over in the short term like 7 out of 10 times
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,/r/theydidthemonstermath
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Not an advisor. Do you.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The finn are the problem. They were a bit like those super star still having problem to understood their own success and the failure thereafter.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I like a good chip dip 😋
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone that's been wheeling PLTR for a few months now, I can tell you IV has cratered recently."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you know if your shares are loaned out?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets, This news doesn't even move the needle against their market cap.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The drop was already priced in too...5D Chessckers
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell the news
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Strap on! Bout to be the longest sideways dip in history...  iRemindme! 78years

Edit: [sounds about right](https://imgur.com/gallery/JcROSBZ)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The Viking Dude (K something) loves PLTR lolz.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the right answer
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have very little interest in the stock.  I really do not know why it is a big deal on wallstbets.  The internet says it is a data analytics company.  Which in my mind is a front of some sort.  Maybe Government.  But, with google analyzing everything how much money can be in analytics.  But, the company is probably dependent on Government contracts.  So, it probably will never meet any point of need or demand.  So, what would fuel a spike in the price.  Unless their is a major War.  idk,  Maybe I just do not see it."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. Has been a rough ride but I believe
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,At least AMD popped last year...
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold some at 21 and 22 that I was hoping to get assigned, but both exired above the strike on Thursday. Ended up just buying in at 23.81."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I have been thinking about it and I’m going to buy Monday Jan 23 $20 calls. They are offered at $10. It would give me a $30 cost basis in 2 years.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie got me again!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shhhhh, don't try to explain market cap to palantards"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They seems like a good long hold stock where you can park a good $10k and leave it for years .  Then again.... I rather put those 10k on Microsoft
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They probably havent even looked at the float. They have 1.7b outstanding shares.. thats more than they have in $ revenue. And they're still diluting to pay their execs and have no plan to stop.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s not even news worthy! Just goes to show don’t read stories and invest in a stock. In fact go against the grain!!!! That’s my DD
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Umm the palantiri are not the all seeing eye. They are group of crystal balls that do 2 things. 1. They communicate with each other. 2. They could see things from afar. The all seeing eye was the banner of the orcs as it alluded to sauron. It should be noted in the books unlike the movies there was no literal eye on the top of barad‐dur.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, so they sell intel to the highest bidder"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,hell no i bought it at around 20$ a share and I'm up 13.99% on it
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I don’t think this is how it works. Assignment is automatic if the contract you sold is ITM. $.01 above strike means assignment."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is a meme (Or is it 🧐)

But PLTR has just been going sideways or down even tho tons of news of new partnerships/deals have come out. Usually a stock goes up on positive news but not PLTR 🤣"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re saying the entire market isn’t overpriced?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their use of data to detect ""terrorists"" and im pretty certain they have started using it in certain american police forces to predict where crimes will happen...or there were at least talks of it"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Read the 10K and 10Qs noob!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Booz Allen, Raytheon, Leidos, etc."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Let’s see how weird my logic is when the stock plummets on monday
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks man
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Gold
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Underrated comment.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I was high on potenuse.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear the pods with OXY-clean are the best.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"And sir, would you say that you’re more or less retarded than 🖍 🍽 🦍?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hugs make everything better. Except $HITIF.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s straight out of the BB investor guidebook.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So you are saying buy the dip?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I've learned anything from GME, it's ""fuck the news"""
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem with Palantir is the insider trading.  The stock voting rights are structured in such a way that no matter how much stock the CEO sells, he still has control.  (Yes, I'm aware that this is a slight oversimplification.)  That means that initially his interests start off being tethered to the interests of the shareholders, but the more stock he sells the more his interests diverge from the stockholders.  Once he gets down to 1 share, he could short PLTR, take actions as CEO to run the entire fucking company into the ground, and make billions, leaving the shareholders holding the bag.  And yes, technically that would be illegal, but the thing about illegal activity is that when you have billions of dollars to spend on lawyers, it turns out it's actually not *that* illegal actually.

That's why I try to keep an eye on the insider trading.  Don't get me wrong, PLTR is a great company with a great product, I just don't like their incentive structure."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a long haul stock. It's been trading around it's support consistently though so probably a good time to buy.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every time there's news about PLTR, some set of retail investors learn what the company they're holding does and get out."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like BlackBerry lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly in my extremely short time paying attention to the market, whenever there is “good news” of something big happening the stocks always dump.  But whenever a celebrity mentions a stock it jumps. I don’t get it."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,90 million dollar contracts are bad news. Low margin nonsense
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll buy that dam dip so hard just like last week
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s been overvalued, any news is a just reminder of that..."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Trying to learn but new any advice would be appreciated I'm doing my own research but if you guys could provide me some tips I'd really appreciate it. I think my mom may pass away soon so I'm trying to see what the hell I can do besides go to financial advice
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,As long as it's red!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Is THAT what I've been doing wrong?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"By my logic, the moon can be reached by flying north or south"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It keeps dipping and I keep buying!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Not if you are selling options.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,moar dips till my brain falls out
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,i love a good laugh
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you are using a brokerage that has a lending program, then you have the ability to see reports on that. WeBull shares profits with you and allows you to see frequency and amount."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're not using Robinhood or a broker that lends your shares for their profit, you get notified and earn interest and can exit at any time (recall your loaned shares). Webull for example (no comission) allows you to lend your shares as an opt in program and recall your shares whenever you want, dm if you want a link."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I question it. No reason a solid company with good financials should see their stock dipping when they announce a large contract.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Because the company is already overvalued. This is a good contract but they need bigger contracts or a lot more like this for their already ~50bn market cap to increase.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This comment is severely underrated.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Not your first rodeo
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I thought I'd grab 5 @ 30.

You're among long-term hodlrs, don't worry."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit, the thread of replies to this...

This is why I wsb.

20 shares @ $37.00 and suddenly not feeling so shitty about it"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"means you need to buy more, buy enough and your breakeven can be 24"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Look on the bright side you used up all your anti-luck for the year.... Right?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking same. Bought 100 shares at $29/ea because I figured having a nice round number would help me keep track of it. At this point I just want it to go back so I can break even
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Average down!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Same :(
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats my average too....hahahhahahhaha i believe in skynet tho......

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[$89 million can buy many peanuts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgct3Jn8pFA)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember when Amazon didn’t make a profit either?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I almost caught the bottom after months of watching it I got in at $21.70 avg. And got some $30c May exp."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course the stock price will increase with time but that will happen to most tech stocks. Nothing special about PLTR unless they get some crazy contracts or groundbreaking innovations.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"no, they sell their analytics and software platform to governments and businesses that already have data to analyze."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No that's GOOG.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what I thought, I sold the 23 calls and the stock closed at $23.07 and my stock wasn't called. How far did you go out? The January 40s are like $2.25 or something"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, the problem is Karp, Cohen and Thiel keep dumping stock, else it would be trading around $28.. now I hear Karp has to sell 1.2 Billion worth just to cover his tax liability, that's some bullshit"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What does that have to do with hedge funds?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you have even basic accounting knowledge? PLTR is operating at a loss,due to the high-level of SBC it gives to its employees. The company has over 2 billion in cash."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Raytheon is not a soft.only company and PLTR has  beaten them numerous times when both firms competed for the same contract. Actually a lot of the contracts that PLTR gets from the government are sole-source, cuz PLTR is basically the only company that fulfills all of the requirements."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,A stain on our reputation as internet curators not to upvote
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're adorable, thank you!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, BB.  I shall hold thee until the end of time because I believe in the company.  And also because I'm 50% below my cost basis."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB bag holder checking in, can confirm."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought at $23, fml"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,And NOK years ago. And still holding that bag.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I am very long on PLTR. I'm not much to swing trade it, but I think it has legs for years to come."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,ABTFD
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,">And yes, technically that would be illegal, but the thing about illegal activity is that when you have billions of dollars to spend on lawyers, it turns out it's actually not that illegal actually.

Depends on whose billions you're reposessing"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t that the same structure as Facebook tho?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The problem with this anal is all the govt and intel community business.  They’d find a way to ruin him.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's likely more than just the incentive structure. As they work extreemly closely with government agencies it's important that the company remains under consistent ownership in terms of voting.


Imagine how quickly it would kill the company if share holders started requiring them to do disclosures on the things their platforms are used for."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"he can get more shares as form of compensation.

it would be unusual for him, as a ceo, to not be compensated with an equity plan like ISO/RSU for no other reason than tax treatment. He'd much rather pay capital gains on shares than income tax on a high salary."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Good observation. Is that moral hazard for PLTR's CEO?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh it make sense.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the rumor sell the news
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t buy Palantir. Don’t buy things once they show up on Reddit it’s too late most of the time. Screen stocks for gems that are oversold and have indicators that they will moon or recover soon. Look at the cost distributuon graph if available. Don’t buy in the morning. Don’t sell in the morning for a loss. That’s about it
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he means this 📈 when you read it from right to left.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,solid red foundation builds a green house
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,...Do you know de wey?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the way
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a minimum account value for webull to use this? Fidelity has a minimum $250k account value :/
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the feedback.  I use TdAmeritrade.  Did a cursory glance to see if this is an option there and didn’t find anything.  I’ll keep looking.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"my old acct got banned for calling a GME bagholder's logic, in a less polite manner, ""very stupid"". They responded the way they always do by calling themselves ""retarded"" and that's the whole movement about taking back wall street or whatever. Of course I'm the one that ended up getting banned."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,90 million are tiny federal contracts
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So are the other tickers, have healthy Q revenue and yet still keep dipping in value..go figure."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Watch the demo. I worked it on school manufacturing companies. Shit makes my life so easy. If your company is global, no way it doesn't meet your needs"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like the $22 billion contract for Microsoft doing augmented reality (or whatever the fuck) for DOD over SEVERAL YEARS.  That's peanuts.

FWIW, I'm in the Army and have worked on the acquisition/development side of the house for the last few years.  I've never had direct dealings with Palantir but I know people that have done business with them... the results were *underwhelming*.  I steered clear of PLTR because their reputation in certain defense circles is not good."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,800 @ $29 🤡
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in at 26$ a share at 500 shares fmllll
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 25 shares @ $37 and then bought 26 more to average down some but I'm still at @ $33 per share lul. 

I'm holding long term though."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm already in by 7k...
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not entirely accurate. I hope more people see this as to clear up the confusion.

Wall Street still makes bank on DPOs. A buddy from MS said they still collect their fees. It’s just as a financial advisor instead of as an underwriter. Go look at Spotify or Roblox and check their financial advisors. They still use Morgan Stanley and Goldman. Companies need banks to help with the filing process, creating the presentations for the roadshow, drafting the story for the prospectus. The only difference is finding the institutional investors, since retail can invest directly in a DPO."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Man this is so helpful. So who is “Wall Street” in this context? Just an umbrella term for the big investment firms in New York? Like Ivy League?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahhh. That makes sense now. No wonder it won't behave itself. Greedy fucks on Wall St at it again.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like this, count me in"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"MU was entering the memory downcycle which is why it wasn't ""mooning"" back then. they had quite a bit of convertible debt. they got out of that last year and the upcycle began, which is why they are mooning now.

stop with the stupid conspiracies, please."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly and word of mouth gets them more business
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Client diversification into private sector would be big. I agree it's a deal, if it's a one year contract that'd be more impressive which I I hope it is."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"And its also worth noting that the value of their existing contracts have a pretty consistent rate of growth. Palantir grow their contracts vertically, not horizontally."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"💯

This is all about the PLTR Biz Dev pipeline.

Moving from Gov to Business.

Any company in any industry.

The business world is drowning in data."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Care to show your math on that? The company is valued at over $40B and according to this the entire market in 2021 would be worth $40B (2019 value) x 1.42 (2020) x 1.42 (2021) = roughly $80B so 50% of the TAM. They don’t own anywhere near that but it’s also a stupid way to determine value. They had roughly $1B revenue last year and are forecasting 30% growth this year so $1.3B which gives it a roughly 32 P/S making it one of the most expensive stocks in the market.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It wasn't until almost 8 YEARS after amazon's first profitable quarter (q4 2001) that it cracked a $40 bil market cap (Q3 2009).
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Super Mario Day?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the honesty
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is great info on here about Palantir, please research and decide if it fits your portfolio interests!  It’s very affordable and there’s a lot of interest in it.  This stock debuted late last year."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The holiday may affect assignment and/or settlement, but rest assured those shares will be called away from you at the 23.00 strike. In either case though, this sounds like a win for you, though. You’re going to be paid 23.00 per share for either shares you already have (had) or you’ll wake up with a short position that you can close immediately by buying cheaper as long as the price actually stays below 23."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Got better accounting skills than your dumbass. Keep buying that shit stock. You probably bought Gamestop at 400 and AMC at 20. Sit the fuck down.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m speaking specifically to software contracts. I’m not talking about multi billion manufacturing contracts. The other problem with stuff like this is that it’s all speculative aside from the first $13 million or so it’s not guaranteed money, and contracts are not optioned fairly regularly. With regard to winning no bids, yeah, that happens because of their analytics software and with stuff that is specifically designed to take advantage of said software. The point is that in the defense contracting world, this is not a substantial figure for a large contractor. Being that Palantir is a mid-sized contractor, it may be significant for them, but I still don’t think it’s enough to move the needle. If they snag something in the hundreds of millions in the coming years as a prime or sole source, then I would expect movement."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Also highly underrated.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"> *You’re adorable, fuck you !  

For the mother of all dildo’s sake where is WSB going, why this ??!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I too am BB fomo survivor. Group hug? 🥺

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,500 @ $25 here😭
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB is solid hold, operating system for EV 

you're not holding bags you're hopefully buying more early"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,$26 for me
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re weak hearted crying alpacca, I'm holding from 44s, 42 save 40s'... Got more n 30s and 25s.  Collect the shares... They'll rip again upwards"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,$23 is cheap lol.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That's not even bad lol. I have 700 shares averaging $30 LMAO
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If youre really concerned just sell covered calls against them with a $25 strike expiring on Friday. You can do that every week.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where are your positions? I looked at Nokia but with the price, amount of shares etc I decided against putting money on them."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eh, here pretty soon im gonna get tired of waiting for it to pop off and I'll 
do you all a solid. I'll sell and eat my $500 loss it'll jump up to $45 the day after, then $60 the next week.

I have the power."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would do the same, if I had money to burn. Given the time frame PLTR has been out there, and their end game, going long is imho the only good option right now."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t get the investment thesis on pltr, why are you long on it?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy and sell covered calls is the way to go.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It's only illegal if the government doesn't have their cut of the deal.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How about Appian?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I cancelled the purchase before it was set to go through this morning. I am a newb and was drinking too much last night but thanks for the advice.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://mapmeld.medium.com/charts-when-you-read-right-to-left-614f0a2cf54d

I've been wondering about this for a while.

I've heard the emojis are red and green because in some Asian countries (all? At least Japan) red is good.

But I've wondered for a while about r2l languages. Do they have time run right to left? Looks like some hebrew sources do, but some arabic sources do not.

Fascinating to me.

What about the bottom to top languages? Idk."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"My exit strategy is a homemade 12ga 6"" PVC ram-pipe loaded with some pissin' hot ratshot.

No offence to dirty ghetto bitches."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,There is not.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously I got banned from reddit for a week for using FD spelled out on here. Reddit admins are so....not autistic.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What did I just look at?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,True but was thinking a position. I've been watching for a few months and would a good stock to be patient with.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"90m for this contract alone, but they also have other contracts with the government and other international offers."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,With a completion date of 2026......
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What does palantir do for manufacturing companies?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"200 @ $38 

Don't try to out ape me"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,hope you're selling ccs
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,1300 at 29 here. I don’t even bother checking it some days anymore
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"43 shares at $34.21. I was in earlier way lower but then I bought ""the dip"" on the backside of the meme action. The dip is eternal."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell some Covered calls you’ll make bank. Not financial Advise
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude! 👈🏼This guy fucks backwards!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,everything is overpriced!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"OK...do you think Wall St still prefers IPO?

I assume IPO still drives more Wall St revenue than DPO."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They already are playing in the private sector...see 3M and Henkel
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Boiled please, like all the cousin fuckers down south."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,And in 2008-09 we were in a recession....different market now
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,March 10th
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you SuperUniC0rn it definitely is affordable, and about the only thing I know is that it debuted last year at like $9 haha. I watched the commotion from WSB when it jumped up late last year thinking how ridiculous & high quality the memes were, but then I figured these retards are making bank of course it's this crazy.

&#x200B;

Now I get it."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I got a notice on my account and it said that the Options Expired. Usually when I get Called, it doesn't give me the expired notice, it gives me the Call was assigned notice.
You're right though, I will get $23 per share and if it opens up on Monday lower, I'll jump back in. What Calls did you sell?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually bought CFD's on PLTR when it was at 10 and sold at 30. Bought shares at 24.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was late and I felt thankful, but you're right. Fuck em. And fuck you too.

❤️"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,bag holder too ✋🏼
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't have a super large position, about 200 shares.  Everything seems to be trending downward so I don't think I'm missing many other potential gains right now.  At least none I'm yet confident enough in to take a 50% loss on one of my positions."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Let’s hear it for “buying more early”. Sounds like good investment strategy just feels like $hit.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought more on Friday
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know where the stock will be in a year and down the road further. I’ve averaged down, but will continue to buy throughout the year. Mostly shares, some Jan 22 and 23 calls, especially right now at current price levels."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,$26 gang rise up
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,My average cost of PLTR is $36.23. It's not a loss if I don't sell.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought like 20 shares at $26, sold in 24hrs for $30.50.


I bought myself a Tony's Pizza with my winnings and put half away for my large tax bill I assume is coming up."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately I don't have 100 shares so can't do covered calls
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought a small position years ago when it was around $5/share and figured with 5G development it would eventually come back. It has not.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds great man! We’ll get you back
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,But I thought I controlled the market
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If you wanna buy back in at 60 I’ll sell you my shares
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,plz halp
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m glad this doesn’t just happen to me
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That is the worst feeling.  I've had this happen a few times...actually more.  I decided to just stop the bleeding and cut my losses.  I sold at a big loss and then a few weeks later here we are now and if I had just held them I could now sell and have a profit.  It is so frustrating.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmk when you sell, so I can buy 500 shares!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So if both of us sell will it jump $90 the next day?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"buy the rumor, sell the news. AMIRITE?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold tight bro 😎.  Wait til it drops some more
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Please do. I bought high thinking it was a good solid stock then it kept dropping so I did my part for the hedges. I didn't even know it was a meme stock.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Your powers are a lot like mine
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gonna need you to go ahead and get on this. You don't happen to have any GOEV you want to prematurely dump as well, do ya?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy straddles
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,same here :-(
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe in you, man.  I’m in at a comfy $22, so I’m good for now.  I’m only buying more PLTR dips of $20 and under to average down."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone on here just needs to buy a bunch of puts so everyone else can go green. Need a sacrifice.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Great platform with incredible moat. Check out some of the posts from people who’ve used the software in their organization
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The start of a rabbithole. Should you follow it it may distract you from what would be a devastating options loss.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Heres another one to learn about: https://youtu.be/0qcNiHBvMWM
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I choose companies I hold long I only go with companies that have leaders that have a proven sound morale compass. Peter thiel has proven the exact oppisitte. Wsb is making a huge mistake trying to make pntr a meme stock. It's bad news, their leadership is bad news. They will never have a company that can inspire their employees to do great things. They will bleed brains at a huge rate. They are just not good. They are not using technology for good."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I also think it will all lead to bigger contracts.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The smoothest of the brains. Not a wrinkle on it.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell some CCs to try and wrinkle out that smooth brain
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did you buy at 38? I hold 204 @24.6 and I believe pltr is great but why did you buy at 38?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This MOFA king ape fucks backwards AND pokes holes in his condies! 🦾💎
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Premiums have been shit lately
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy more, sell covered calls at $34 a share until PLTR starts getting closer to $34, get your cost basis down, my average buy was $27 a share but my cost basis is down around $19 thanks to reasonably high IV and sideways or downward trading for the last couple months"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,43 shares is so easy to average down just buy 100 right now
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I unloaded all my rblx yesterday when it finally went green overall for me. At $45 I might actually buy some to hold lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, Roblox did a DPO. No new shares were created. Initial sales were all from existing holders, employees and previous investors.

This is very different from selling half the company to a bank and having them re-sell the shares as in an IPO.

It may not have looked like a DPO from the consumer side because hype was high, liquidity was low and the price immediately popped up because there were more buyers than sellers.

There were a couple of people who posted here about having their lower priced buy orders filled, but those were filled as the price shot up to the first public ticker value.

You're forgetting that any stock's ticker value is a trailing indicator of what previously happened over the course of many transactions, not some definitive forward looking indicator that can be repeated or relied on absolutely."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya and I bought opening day ..![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hardly. Which is why diversifying would be good, private sector is where the money is and sounds like 3M contract is around $10mil"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,“Diversifying” doesn’t mean between the private sector and government. You apes I swear. Spying on fucks and being paid for it by governments is quite possibly the best business to be in
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't know boiled existed, but saw cajun seasoned and I'm led to believe you're statement is accurate."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, well I bought 4000 shares at 8.99 and sold at 30. Made a fuck ton of dough. But PLTR isn't worth shit so I GTFO. I had high hopes for them but they're a glorified beltway bandit. You're not American so you probably don't understand what that is. They are an overvalued government contractor. If they get their act together I'll go long on them again. Bit I aint about this cult of personality Karp has."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you my dear, fuck you too 🚀🚀🚀"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"2…uh, hundred shares here…at…uhh…27^ish

Hold me…"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So my $12.3 is coming soon?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"$18, September contracts though"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,650 shares at 26.04.  LFG
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So was mine, but I actualized that loss to invest in a certain gaming related company :)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You did not overpay you just purchased sooner

2021-04-02 23:15:16,wallstreetbets,"Canadian Lumber Stocks 🪵🇨🇦 **Lumber Sector**

First of all the lumber sector is booming right now so the lumber companies have been doing very well because of it. Right now lumber prices are skyrocketing as we are seeing lumber futures above $1000 once again making new all time highs. Lumber is in high demand as covid has caused a lot of these companies to not be operating at their maximum so there is a shortage on supply. A lot of these companies stock prices have surpassed their 2018 highs while others are nearing it. A big reason why lumber stocks peaked in 2018 and have decreased since is because of the new laws and regulations that have caused higher tariffs on their revenue, sales, etc. In 2020 the new stay at home lifestyle has caused people to take on new projects such as building a new deck for their backyard, or renovating their house as a whole. Canada has seen a huge housing market boom because of the shortage of supplies and people have been upgrading their houses to put in on the market and make a profit. Not to mention the increased immigration once Covid settles down which will spark a increase in building of new homes. Lumber prices won't be going down anytime soon and I believe it'll maintain these prices for 2021.

**Lumber Stocks**

Right now I see a company that is severely undervalued when compared to its competitors and that is Canfor Corporation, $CFP on the tsx. \*Note all numbers are expressed as millions of dollars\*

&#x200B;

[Canfor 2020 Financial Reports Summarized ](https://preview.redd.it/6srhobyp4tq61.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae213b4863e40a8862e4100903e2bd5ca32f8624)

As you can see their revenue and shareholders equity have been increasing quarter over quarter at a nice rate. Their price per book is looking good and their market cap in comparison to their quarterly revenue is also extremely good. Now let's compare it with Stella-Jones, $SJ and West Fraser Timber, $WFG.

&#x200B;

[Stella-Jones 2020 Financial Reports Summarized](https://preview.redd.it/cvqtqd2c5tq61.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=92d04d8e989b0ccf8d14dce25e463b1ad974f898)

&#x200B;

[West Fraser 2020 Financial Reports Summarized](https://preview.redd.it/2ltf63mg5tq61.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5c0b055b146d2e79485e369259e082345fae6a9)

**Analysis**

There are some key differences that we should make note of:

\- SJ and WFG both are trading at much higher price/book than Canfor.

\- Canfor is posting much higher revenue than Stella Jones (nearly doubled) yet is trading at nearly the same market cap.

\- Canfor and West Fraser have nearly identical revenues and net income yet West Fraser is trading at an 11 billion market cap while Canfor is trading at a 3 billion market cap.

**Conclusion**

In all honestly you could buy just about any 3 of these companies and you'll make a decent ROI in 2021. However, Canfor appears to be the most undervalued amongst its peers and offers the highest value. This isn't financial advice as what has said is just my mere opinion on the matter. I don't have a position in any of the mentioned companies but I am looking to take a position after the long weekend. Remember to do your own research and due diligence where necessary."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"""I lost my life savings to Canadian lumber futures"""
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The housing boom in Canada is simply retarded. Theyve built so many new developments in my city. The HUGE boom was 10+ years ago. But still. There putting homes next to a garbage dump where I live right now cause they are running out of room. Tons of condos and apartment buildings. Its absolute madness.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,First DD that isn’t GameStop I’ve seen in a while. Bless your heart Ape
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Am home builder and can confirm on this. My company is taking it up the ass on lumber pricing and no company can promise pricing for more than 5 days cause these prices are more volatile than penny stocks
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would knee pads be a good play, anyone have some tickers?  Home builders need good knee pads, and with the influx of wsb users behind wendys that could use them as well this could be a huge play"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I negotiate lumber pricing for builders and can confirm what everyone here is saying. There are many reasons why we are where we are but in short/COVID/Texas Freeze(plastics and drywall), MDI resin shortage(insulation, garage doors, freezers/fridges), MDI also has an impact on the OSB market. The price run up in OSB has been significant and is trading at levels never before seen in history with no end in sight. Lumber however has seen a drop on the composite indicator published by Random Lengths report. Having discussions with larger national LBM suppliers, this has little effect in the near term of street pricing as open market wood(as opposed to contracted supply) is trading significantly higher than Randoms. LBMs can’t raise pricing fast enough, and neither can builders. Boise/LP/Weyerhaeuser have all had decent earnings reports if I remember correctly. Personally, I feel like we are at a tipping point with demand. When lumber is close to 3x from last year and it takes longer to get an appliance than a build cycle lasts, things are seriously fucked. I don’t know that I have great advice for the investment in lumber, but the second demand stops which could be as simple as one of the top ten builders saying they will slow production schedules or the fed upping rates, you’ll see a dip in price and and increase in supply.  Anyways, ramble over, I probably won’t play the historically high lumber market myself but could see some potential for gains if the market stays hot.

Edit: I should add I am in US, but a huge portion of our lumber comes from Canada."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I can see it now.  WSB buys all Canfor stock and renames it as USfor.

Lots of run way to get back to the all time highs of yester-year. And the weak point of this market are protectionist policies from the US. Not saying they won't happen, but I doubt they would choke supply when infrastructure spending and home building are key to keeping everything rebounding. I looked at CFB (among others) last weekend and was kicking myself for missing the 10% week. Re-evaluating it, it is still a great buy at a PE of 6 and a ton of runway. Thanks for the reminder DD."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a Canadian Tugboat Captain who lives in western Canada and I tow Chip barges and log barges to the Mills and dump sites. I wouldn't touch any of these stocks with a 10 ft pool. The industry has been highly depressed between the softwood lumber dispute and the nationalism with the Biden and Trump administration. Not to mention also the Canadian dollars fairly high right now I believe 80 cents to the US dollar so if that goes down then you would lose value just on the exchange. Assuming you're investing in US dollars.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Late to the party but since I work in the lumber industry I can give some more input.

Canfor and West Fraser are both massively investing in new Neural Network driven grading technologies for their lumber. The technology is ground breaking in the lumber industry and offers very short ROI (think around 3-6 months where normally lumber mills aim for a 1 year ROI for their optimization systems). The Technology is spreading fast but those two companies (along with Georgia Pacific) are the first to the party. 

Canfor has mills in Canada (mainly west coast) but also in many places in the south of The United States.

I don't know what that means stock wise, but thought this might help you guys figure it out."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This squeeze has squoze on this already. A crash is incoming for lumber and the housing market in general. The only reason people are building right now in the US is because the interest rates dropped. Even with lower interest rate the prices have finally eclipsed the cost effectiveness of building. The cost of building a house has increased 75-80% at the very least and people are getting gunshy.

&#x200B;

I totally see the pricing continue to increase until the Canadian housing bubble bursts, or the cost of lumber just becomes prohibitive to build, and people switch to metal 2x4's.   But even with this switch, you will still need flooring boards, walls, etc.  So there is only upside on a lumber play as I see it."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The issue with lumber is that a lot of people are putting projects on pause right now due to the prices. Yes, some are still buying, but a lot of people are just waiting for the prices to go down.

I feel this is similar to when gold spiked to like 2k 10 years ago and all the gold scrappers in my area (NY) just refused to accept scrap. Just because the price is going up doesn't necessarily mean people will buy - they will find ways to pause projects and go without and wait for the price to go back down."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn you’re missing out on some gains cause of ignorance, but good luck with your other plays man"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. They are high because of mill closures/idling in 2019/2020 that lowered supply, and the massive boom in demand from home remodels and home construction. Perfect storm of supply/demand imbalance that is projected to last over a year."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. 

1) for the larger lumber companies, some of the surge is priced in, but lumber has surged so much more so its not fully priced in. For the smaller value plays, they have very low Forward PE’s which will get even better after Q1 E and analysts revise estimates 

2) futures show this elevated price is going to stay for a year or longer. Google cme lumber futures. January 2022 futures already at 750. Historically, anything over 600 is awesome for these companies. May is already over 1000. So the prices arent coming down meaningfully for multiple quarters"

Maybe it has to do with electricity because metal studs? Is that something? Lol 

There ....enjoy my thought process..and let me assure you I’m not going to touch the metal studs I just overheard the men talking .... and got excited I could contribute to this conversation and now look what happened a single follow up statement has shattered everything 😩"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. March was my personal best in 20 plus years. I can’t believe how many lumber packages are 70-125k right now. Most of my career they were 20-50k. We get straight % of sale vs % of GM
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had similar thing happen to me in housing crash in 2006. Lost everything and watched the majority of our my customers/friends go bankrupt while the politicians friends got the huge bailouts. I got out of the business for 12 years, never thinking I would be back."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not missing out on any gains. My investments are doing just fine thank you. I'm giving you an honest opinion of my experience working in the industry since 1988.  I know first hand how volatile the logging industry is but if you want to equate that to ignorance then by all means it's your money.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. I'm not disputing those factors. Maybe should have worded my original post a little differently. I thought covid PPE was also a contributing factor.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,it makes me wonder if its too late to get in on it .. market cap doubled alone in the past 6 months. then again ive noticed all these canadian lumber stocks are rebounding nicely idk how much the rally can continue
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh boy, sorry about that.  Didn’t mean to be cryptic.

CFMF = cold form metal framing (eg metal studs).

MC = metal clad electrical cable.  It’s required when framing with CFMF.

Romex = those white and yellow plastic-clad wires that electricians use in wood framing.

Your less cute contractors will presumably know all this already and will price things accordingly.  Anyway, good luck with your project!"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe your not seeing things clearly. Youre not seeing the forest for the trees (yes, i did.)

This is a basic situation: Prices have exploded.  This will create back pressure on demand.  Leading to longer term demand at production.    Costs of production havent risen either (at the same degree) to the producers -- leaving more margin to be had as supply evaporated.

Id say this basic reality gives these players a series of very good quarters (8? 12?) ahead.  Is that already priced into their shares?  Maybe.  Looking at these three in historical perspective, you can see they're all at or near highs.  But never have we seen this explosion in the price of the commodity itself."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you’re arguing with bots.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Underrated post
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That may be for the price of Wood pulp which is also sky rocketing. Wood pulp being the basis for almost all paper products. So ppe surge could contribute to that. But generally wood pulp and lumber prices are unconnected because their sources are different. The trees used for paper products are different than those used to make construction lumber.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"To the moon. 
Consider that lumber was less then 300 USD in march last year. Most of these lumber producer  were nearly bankrupt. Huge debt and no profits. Now its totally different. They are all cash maschines with lumber more than 1000 USD. No worries. Rallye is not over."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for explaining that was nice of you to do that!! AND I was totally right about the metal studs and electricity lol my god I’m almost a triple threat!!!! Just need one more threat! Is good at stocks a threat? Cause if so then I’m a triple threat!  

All joking aside, my husband is an electrician because everyone in Canada has a trade job or is a lumberjack at least in the western provinces. So hopefully he knows this if not I’ll repeat your words and he will think I’m a genius lmao 

Unless he asks a follow up question then I’ll be screwed....lmao"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've actually never heard of that rule before, maybe it's specific to your location? I've seen people run romex through metal studs with plastic bushings. Bit of a pain but a lot cheaper than BX"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"ICF offers completely rot free, waterproof, extremely airtight, almost completely soundproof, structurally strong (with proper rebar) and lightweight building solutions. Another benefit on the rainy coast is that you din’t run the risk of having your build be soaking wet and have to dry it out after envelope completion. One of the reasons the crew likes it so much is we’re  playing with styrofoam blocks instead of heavy formply and etc. Far less wear and tear on the body. 

We can do ICF all the way to the roof, and then plunk a truss package on top and roof it."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure there is money to be made, it's just out of my comfort zone as far as risk to  reward goes. So, let's have a quick look at Canfor. There's hardly any volume 3month average around 300k. 50% is held by Insiders. It's not available in the Options market so I can't leverage it in my TSFA or RRSP account. It doesn't pay a dividend so there's really no value to the stock other than speculation. The soft wood tariffs just increased April 1st. I'm not saying there isn't money to be made I just don't think it's the best bang for your buck. I'd rather buy a real estate investment trust (REIT). They usually pay a good dividend and you can chase them by selling covered calls. Just my two cents thanks."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I concur, plastic bushings are possible sometimes, but the increase in labor often outweighs the material savings in my experience.

The top 5 most purchased cars in the US in 2020 all have entry level prices less than $28,000. There’s zero indications from Tesla that they are making moves into that price range, and are instead continuing to focus on the $50,000 and up range- which is fine, but that price range will never allow it to be “the most popular vehicles”"

I just thinks crazy to assume within the decade the Ford, GM, and Toyotas are all going to be overwhelmed by Tesla’s on the road. Tesla just doesn’t have the man power or the vehicle demographic to do so anytime soon"

That’s all I was ever saying. Stock price will still soar and rightfully so, just slow the roll on it taking over the auto industry- it’s not even about that for them anyways."

$PYPL - PayPal is still in the midst of a pretty significant dip. Look for them to bounce back to 300.00 in the next few weeks. Cash is becoming outdated, finance is becoming simpler and easier.

Now, I think personally PayPal is the blockbuster of payment companies. Old. Successful but *old*. Really good numbers but Paysafe already has all the companies kids will be using. And if those kids grow up and continue to use Paysafe it'll just get more profitable. 
  
Square is wildly popular. Jack Dorsey is obviously a smart man. And I think cashapp will be around for a loooooong time. Have you ever been in the inner part of any city? All the poor people use cash app. It's UI is simple and people with 4 kids in the tough brooklyn neighbors who are always paying their baby daddy's and momma's child support all use cashapp. 

But nothing is gonna take off like e-commerce in the next few decades. And Paysafe has a heavy e-presence already. I see Paysafe and Cashapp dominating the payment game in 2030."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll give you one guess
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pll does? I will check the deal out. If they do, it is a big deal! Thanks!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha spodumene is a fun word to read.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah and it struggles to even stay above 10. Definitely not a play to recommend.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with this completely.   Good food, beer and old movies would be awesome.  I think AMC will come up with something and so I'm holding for a few years.  If they simply continue what they were doing prepandemic with dirty theaters and overpriced food then I will have been wrong.  They have an opportunity to reinvent themselves and hopefully they will take it."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Cinemas wont die but amc hasn't been profitable in years
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I don’t have cable TV or a printer anymore and life is fine without them. 

I have zero intention of ever going to a movie theater unless it’s for the once a year spectacle of Avengers or next Avatar. And that will probably be the IMAX theater. 

I watched Godzilla v Kong st home and it was awesome. Big TVs are cheap and wireless surround sound is easy setup. One purchase and all streaming platforms make your living room a move theater. 

COVID accelerated the death cycle of movie theaters."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,wtf are you talking about? Do you know what P/E is or do you seriously believe this company that makes 150M in revenue is going to make 400M in net income one year later?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hehe. I was so stupid. I bought both amc AND Sundial...
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock already got diluted like 4 times in a year and went from 105million float to 450 so far. Now they want to double the float yet again but somehow ppl still think there's a possible squeeze
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You really think so? Hope u are right. Every day the stock is going down...

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"United took the most drastic steps in the first part of the pandemic to reduce cash burn and turtle up. They were the leaders in getting concessions from all unionized employees to work with the company, and Kirby has talked publicly about his desire to come out of the pandemic as a larger airline while all other CEOs are talking about coming back. UAL had been leading the pack, Delta has been following, and AA is licking windows on the bus. Honestly I haven’t been following SWA because I can’t look at more than 3 things without getting a headache."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think its exploitation visa, you see it in the start of each movie. But even with this they can make bank from derivative (food and drinks) and by airing old movies (cheap licence).

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree that amc situation is whole lot different, they weren't profitable even before covid"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Movie theatres will never die completely, I don’t understand how people keep making this argument. I mean, I’m not investing in them as they are definitely going to shrink in the next decade. But people pay for things that they could be doing at home all the time. People pay 5$ for a Starbucks coffee they could make at home, people pay to eat out on a Saturday night when they could cook at home. It’s definitely not a growing market, but there will always be some demand for movie theatres and arguing otherwise is kind of dumb tbh"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Well aren't you a cranky pants - it's a young company who is just starting to grow and doubled revenue last year.  So.... yes?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re not alone. 🦍
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dilution vs going bankrupt... they did what they had to do. Just because they have authority to issue 500m new shares it doesn’t mean they come all at once either. They can do 100m, 200m. Whatever the case. Again, it has to be VOTED on by shareholders, which is it seems, most will vote no. So I don’t understand all these ridiculous arguments like it’s a sure thing."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Spreading fear, uncertainty, doubt. Clearly it’s working. The numbers don’t lie though and the amount of shady manipulation is insane. This is not normal, I’m holding."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Those were my early days on stock picking and WSB. I’ve made some bad decisions, but had only invested Small money (100s of $$). Getting burned like that is an approach to learning I suppose. 
Best of luck on your future investments!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those were your early days? As in like 2 months ago? Dude, I hate to tell you but you still might be there 

Seems like you’re learning though, sorry to break your balls"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yeah’ I’m still in my early days. Up to 3  months ago I only bought conservative ETFs stocks such as VUSA. Still have a long way to go but sundial, ZOM and AMMO we’re bad decisions even for a novice like me."
2021-04-02 21:29:42,wallstreetbets,CLF 2nd Leg Up on Monday. Slight pull back Last Friday. Going to $22 min. Putting the whole account on it. 
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"NICE, put up a weekly chart with RSI 13 ... You will see the 70 line approaching.  Watch that like a hawk as this is a common pattern where the stock goes above like this one did in January, then it pulls back, consolidates and makes another run but gets refuted at that 70 mark on the Weekly RSI .. If it can push past that it should really really fly. However, if it hits and is rejected I've seen stocks crash afterward."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've got 120 calls spread over april, may, and june.  I hope to exit my 4/16s this week.  $22 would be great!"

BULL CASE 2021
- PLTR converts 10% of AWS Top 10 Users...1 new customer
- PLTR converts 5% of AWS Enterprise customers...5K new customers
- PLTR converts 5% of AWS Mid-sized customers...that excludes Small Business...let’s assume 20%...9K new customers 

That’s large incremental client base...from just one partnership.

Anyone wanna change the conversions and/or project the incremental revenue?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you asking to buy aws(amazon) or pltr based on this?

If aws, they have 100s of software vendors on their platform and this is a drop in ocean.

If pltr, it's like selling shoes. Either you sell on amazon or Walmart or anywhere else, shoe must be good to sell not the platform. So doesn't matter for pltr 

Basically it's not a news worthy of moving stock."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Your a piggish ape I see.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"My post is about PLTR’s Business Development Pipeline.

Testing PLTR ERP software on AWS is a great prospect conversion tactic.

That’s why I only did % conversions...and not revenue.

PLTR software needs to be experienced...and PLTR clients are very sticky.

This isn’t just another vendor.

If you don’t understand PLTR’s software or moat...just grab some popcorn and sit this out.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once accumulation is finished, which can take months. Good way to check if this is Wyckoff’s thesis at work is to check institutional ownership. Last I checked there was some decent buying going on with Palantir I think the Canada pension fund took some profits, which I don’t blame them for but the vast majority was buying. I don’t check Palantir often since my time horizon is long but when I do skim through Palantir news and updates everything seems fine to me so I don’t dig any deeper. Just keep an eye on institutional ownership when they update the numbers."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"They sell a unique product. More of a unicorn than a monopoly, really."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk if they even have that unique of a product. Microsoft has literally the same functionality with Dayaverse and Dynamics 365. I think palantir had the hype + niche with gov contracts, but idk I’m holding just to see how far the speculation can go"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"God I need to go learn fucking spreads more this weekend!\~   


How advantageous has learning spreads(And perhaps strangle/straddle/butterfly/condor), been for you compared to solely using calls and puts?

Do you think it helps you realize more income?  


(I know sell/buy calls/puts, and call debit spread, and put credit spread, so far, and I haven't practiced spreads as I haven't turned on margin on RH/WeBull yet to access them, but they look useful!!!\~ I'll be using advanced options trading by Apr. 16(End of my RH contracts/May 21st(End of my WeBull contracts) at the latest.

I just started using a Margin account and only taking 1 play out at a time. The other VIAC calls are just pure speculation that the price will bounce back based on the stock price being underweight now just like I was writing calls when the stocks were high and premiums were insane.

You will make mistakes learning but just make sure you understand the risk and watch the underlying for news and updates.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serious question: How many degrees of separation does it take before it's not insider trading and it's just a rumor going around?







Like if Brooklyn man told his buddy he might have good info, and his buddy invests, would the friend be indicted too?





Or what if Brooklyn man told his friend (friend #1), and friend #1 doesn't invest but goes to friend #2 and is like ""hey friend #2, I know Brooklyn man is a weirdo, but he says GNUS has a good play coming up"" so friend #2 says fuck it and throws some money in it - is that insider trading for friend #2?









I guess I'm wondering at what point in the line are you no longer considered an insider trader but just trading based on some whispers going around. Because technically Brooklyn man would be at least 2 degrees of separation from the actual insider. Insider>Journalist>Brooklyn Man"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a grand jury indictment, not a verdict. He'll still have to go through trial. But at my old firm we had an US Federal prosecutor come in for a talk and he said he could've talked a grand jury into indicting anyone with no evidence. It's really just who they want to go after or not."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"They shorted nomura and credit Suisse. They both wanted to exit Archegos positions in an orderly fashion. Goldman and MS said fuck this shit we don't want to be left holding the bag, and they unloaded before market open and opened shorts on the other two. Basically Nomura and CS were left holding Archegos bags, just to make their shorts go even more brrrrrr goldman strong armed moodys into downgrading nomura and they were done (2008 style)."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not only that, but the article states the reporter is not accused of any wrongdoing. Umm arent reporters supposed to be asking question and not the other way around? At what point is leaking insider information part of his job?"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sorry that you are fully retarded and need to pin it on someone you don't like to help maintain your cognitive dissonance.  Everyone in congress is doing it because they all made sure it's legal.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Just outta curiosity what happens if you don’t have the funds to buy that much. Does it sell automatically?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Robinhood... 🙄
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sorry for your loss.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like how you don’t need to say which stock it is or show it in your picture; we all know it’s GME. 😂

Edit: Oh. I guess it does say GME at the very top in tiny letters if you open the image. Well... still."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You like the stock
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If I were you I would do covered calls to bring the cost basis down. Then again Iam saying this to a fellow gme ape. Diamond hand them to the moon.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is effectively the same as selling your calls or taking the cash without the stock. You just have to sell the stock on Monday and you have the same return as an option with one extra day.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the most WSB purchase ever. This is literally the way.

Jk. This exercise is gonna fuuuuckkk one day 🚀"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Immediately selling the shares after the call is exercised (if the underlying has not changed) is basically the same thing as selling the ITM call.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s your plans?  Sell on the uptick and call it a successful quick flip?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You made a good move. Apetard for life

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Move your funds to TD or another reputable broker. Glad you exercised; good move. Hold strong
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"What does that mean exactly? Having contracts ""excercised instead of sold""?"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe sell one share at a time when it’s at its high🤷🏻‍♂️
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I hear this is going to be a good week for apes so you may have lucked out there bud

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,He accidentally flew to the moon 🌝 😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It only gets exercised automatically if it’s ITM.
So, you’re gains are still realized but the leverage of the contract has expired. 👍"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No you didn’t, that just means....deep down, you like the stonk"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Also a fine retard move. Done like a true ape. We speak your name.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You lucky bastard!!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Way to fail up.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,RH should sell ur ITM calls automatically 1 hour before expiration. strange that it didn't happen to you.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re for real still using rh? Whats wrong with you? Did you join this sub yesterday? There’s no hope left for this place.....
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is gonna get downvoted but if you’re not comfortable couldn’t you just sell most of them next week to not be at such a risk? I’m not sure what the big hoopla is?

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool story bro, you bought some GME. Thanks for letting us know."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Cheers mate
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What app is that?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you finally own some shares?  You are more colorblind than most of us.  This is a downtrend, and you bought into it?  Hell of day trader, more like yearly you are."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Move to a real broker you have the option to sell and buy at the same price on a real brokerage or try transfer just remember the ""The hoods at Robin's nest"" can close stop your account at any time this is not financial advice this is my dummy's opinion."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Robbin the hood
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's good Friday my guy, markets ain't open, but nice try!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Make sure to not allow robinhood to loan them out!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Fate
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Good job OP! Hopefully you didnt have any extra contracts that expired ITM too
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s actually fantastic. Much better to hold the shares than the options
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,He accidently bought. Dump it
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you and your Robinhood
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude move on to other stocks jeez it was a nice ride but there’s more to trading than game stop
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You are so fucked LOL
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t get your hopes up.. he’s gonna sell these on Monday
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,RH? Hhahahahah
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good luck. I think this is going be a huge day for GME!

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This reply makes two jokes.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, the perfect line to wrap up a Good Friday."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You could have dropped 100k and had it expire like the other dude did a few weeks ago. At least you have something to show for it.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,April fucking fools
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since you have the share now, use the over juiced IV values of the OTM calls and sell some covered calls."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can sell the shares lol.

You can also write covered calls now."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell CC and CPS to profit more. Not a total loss.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What was the cost of your contracts is the real question. I’m assuming that cost is on top of the strike price you paid.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So just... sell it on Monday? What's the big deal, not like it's gonna suddenly tank 10% (and if it does, it will come back)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,There he iiiisssss! 🍌🚀
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,God speed retard
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you my girlfriends boyfriend?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You can just sell on Monday as long as it doesn't tank.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Remind me Monday when it sky 🚀🚀🚀 and your my new best friend that u owe me a ride in his new lambos
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isn't your risk level today holding shares lower than it was a couple days ago holding $185 calls? If the price drops to $180 Monday your shares are still valuable, if it had dropped to $180 on Thursday you would have been screwed.

Owning $37,000 of shares seems *way* safer than owning $37,000 of calls."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Acats transfer, takes 2-5 days (mine took two from RH -> fidelity and 5 etrade-> fidelity)

They're going to charge you $75 for it. 

It's worth it"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should be in the clear; the only fuckery I had transferring from RH was they sold my remaining partial share (0.99651...fuck me) at market and then don't allow me to transfer the cash because the account automatically deactivated when the transfer was initiated.

So I have ~$187 in RH that I can't touch, but with those nice fat round numbers you're fine.   Also, remember to sell a couple of $690/$800 CCs and then buy more GME with the premiums!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess OP has never heard of limit sells
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Assuming they're real? Wasn't there some DD a few weeks back that seemed to indicate that RH only actually buys shares when you sell them - assuming that you're selling them at a loss, usually?

Basically, you ""buy"" a share at $10, and RH takes your money. Then, the share drops to $8 and you paper hand that shit. You sell, RH *then* purchases the share at $8 and immediately resells it, giving you the $8, and RH gets to pocket the $2 difference. They effectively used your transaction as a shorting vehicle. 

The exception is when the price rises. When this happens, RH actually buys that share before it gets too high. This is why RH blocked purchasing of GME: they normally don't actually buy shares, and GME's price was getting too high, too fast for them and they couldn't adjust their strategy to use their users a long vehicles instead (not on the fly, anyway). This is also possibly the reason why it is a bitch and a half to transfer your positions out of RH (compared to just closing your positions and transferring the cash): you're forcing them to buy, and they need time to actually obtain the shares you previously ""bought""."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes it does, which is what I expected it to do."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea I forgot to actually put GME in the title, but you’re right. It’s pretty clear which one it was haha"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Forgive me papa
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’ll be a loss of $2,700 if I sold right now"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It certainly is since the share price should be $99,999,999/share"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t believe you
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Exercising a call contract means purchasing the underlying shares (100 per contract). Selling the contract is selling your right to purchase the underlying shares.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I paid ~$4,000"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I don’t recommend using them. Ever."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone who needs to research how selling covered calls works exactly, do you mind elaborating? I would love to not lose money."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why it isn’t already, I don’t have shares of anything else."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Finished the transfer request a few minutes ago
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,100% I can
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The title explains it. OP had call options that expired yesterday. His calls were ITM at expiration and auto excersiced, which means he bought them at the strike price (185). If OP had been watching his options at market close he would have sold the contracts and made some money but instead it auto excercised and now he owns 200 shares at $185. Not a terrible thing at all but not exactly his plan."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"A shitty one, use Fidelity or TD Ameritrade."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh how far wsb has strayed. From “positions or ban” to “stop posting positions”. Very cool.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I said this happened Thursday soo..
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Made sure of that right after I finished with my heart palpitations.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Careful.  You're breaking the first two rules of r/thetagang
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Not if he only sells CCs with half his shares.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Just sell weeklies for a few weeks. Premiums are pretty crazy right now. I don't see the squeeze happening in the next week or two
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats ok you get your max profit earlier but miss the rest of the rally
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Tripped over his dick and lost his virginity 🐓🚀🌕
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is sorta the way?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is accidentally the way.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome. A few questions for you:
1. What does one year of dividend income mean? One year of mortgage payments?
2. Do you keep separate accounts? One for dividend stocks, one for X, another one for Y? I keep everything all in one but interested if others split out intentionally!
3. Do you keep the 60k just in flat cash in the account? Or do you put it in something safe like bonds?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Going through fidelity to initiate the transfer
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,took me only  2 business day     good luck
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Well you better not sell your shares haha. (Jk I don’t have anything in GME. I’m a Nio fanboy)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha its all good, I just find it really funny. I hope you don’t retroactively add it in now!!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,😫 I bought and sold this stock very fast and made money.  No money in holding it interminably
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Given the ‘f -ing’ and ‘testicles’ comments.  I’m not a cat is clearly who I am. Just sayin. 🤷🏼‍♀️
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Can relate totally to contract YOLO 😜
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Underlying shares?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks brother ape i'm still learning a lot, just started trading in January."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The likelihood of you ""losing"" money is slim, as in a covered call scenario, your worst case scenario is your shares getting called away for an agreed upon strike price (which is set by you after you, as you collect the premium). My main concern is how your gains would then be ""capped"" at the strike price.

If your entire plan is based on the ""woops! I never wanted to own these shares!"" Then by all means, sell some CC's, make some extra money due to volatility until these shares get called away.

But be warned, I am of the belief that GME is a unicorn and will be subject to the greatest short squeeze in history. If you sell CC's, you're locked into your gains and can't make any more money than the agreed upon strike.

Know what I mean?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Cash
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay. I love you.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, Thank You"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok cool I thought I was maybe missing something.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did it auto exercise? Was it a glitch?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This ape is ape
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What broker should he move to?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me put it this way. 4 months ago I had $4,000 in my savings."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s why he was driving to the hotel! 🥵🤫
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah. Your wife’s boyfriend just found his new wife, the OP."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry. He won’t know.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, sexsomia"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So you’re saying there’s a chance
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So $40/ share? So your break even is $225/ share?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh you're right. I'm sleepy and forgot to think about how much the actual contracts were worth.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Mods on the GME discord are banning people for using the term because they found out it’s a racist slur that the nazis used. He’s right when he says it’s ammo for the media to use against us
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Or gay bear
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got a warning they would permanently ban my account and this is my first ""admin nono messages"" I've ever gotten lmaooo

Looks like the general public found wsb and isn't happy you're talking shit about their kids. Reddit used to be so much cooler 😫"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea the first thing I notice about these types of posts is that they’re on RH or Etoro/Ameritrade. If they wanna get fucked out of being able to properly trade when this is in the MOASS then that’s their prerogative I guess
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I'm not taking a blog post *by Robinhood* as evidence that they are on the up-and-up. Especially when the obvious, in-disputable evidence so-far (disabling buying of GME and others during a price spike) already shows they at the very least are willing to engage in unethical (and arguably illegal) behavior."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I only need to set aside 10% but yea I’m on it.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. 20k and 40k respectively 

2. Mortgage I try and maintain from my personal income but have moved dividend income to over the years. So my standard checking is my emergency shit because it’s hard to get literal cash from my investment portfolio. Which leads to 3...

3. I keep 60k in cash. It fluctuates but I aim for no less than 50k. I use the 10k for options trading which I then transition to shares over time. Unless I nail a trade and need more cash to pay Uncle Sam"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have 2 long contracts of NIO as well, I’m right there with you 🤝"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The shares. 100 shares per contract, so depending on how many contracts you have will determine how many shares can be purchased."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No worries! Get out there and make some tendies!!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha, thank you very much! I also believe GME will lead to the greatest short squeeze and I wouldn’t want to miss it. So I probably won’t do any CC selling, but I appreciate the info and I’ll be doing research just so I know the strategy!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Love you too ❤️
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, thats how they work. You can check a box that says do not auto excercise. Most of the time people will sell the contract before they even hit expiration or the option is OTM and expires worthless. You also have to have enough cash in your account or enough margin for it to auto excercise, which OP did have enough. Options are interesting and I'm still learning so I could be wrong about some of this stuff"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I know someone who had this problem and he lived in Atlanta where it gets mighty hot in the Summer.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You use your bidet and watch stocks? Nice.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think we use our toilets the same way

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m all out of awards but damn if this doesn’t deserve one.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Robinhood shares dont count because they dont actually buy shares from the market ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trust me, spend the $75 and get into another broker. I transferred over to Fidelity, so nice to be able to actually talk to somebody when your shit's messed up."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"> APE shall not kill APE.

Tell that to Harambe."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No more wife... Regret
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh. Well sell high? Hopefully the rest of the apes can buy buy buy, but uhhhh good luck"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No worries, I’m a prime example of what sleepiness can do 😅"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The SEC can gently nibble my taint and the FBI, well, they're watching anyways, so they can watch again."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same excuses as Tottenham supporters calling themselves yiddos. Because at some point, the original attributed meaning as an insult holds no value, like Citadel's rehypothecation techniques to create synthetic shares. Now help me take this marker out of my belly button."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You think that is an issue with these retards?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Racists ruin everyone's fun ☹️
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Been getting into investing the play money in slightly OTM weeklies lately. Any tips?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha, thanks! Did you consider doing bonds or something low risk to earn a return on that cash, or do you prefer to keep it cash so that it’s basically 0 risk?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trying to catch a falling knife with your bare hands...and yes, I am still attempting theta gang with GME 🙃"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yessir! I bought a 60c 1/22 and a 60c 1/23 before the little spike yesterday. I sold the 1/22 for a 15% gain and im holding onto the other. 

I was wondering if you know when the next good time to buy another 1/23 60c would be? I have ~1000 dollars to spare and I wanna know what your advice is on when to buy these LEAPS and for how long to hold them"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely not financial advice, and make sure to do your own DD."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,My wife is anal about cleaning the toilet and I have one of those little blue tablets hanging on the tank.  Geeze man what kind of effed up well water you using?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Condensation makes it 100000000% worse as well
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,As someone with a PhD in Biotechnology I might be able to tell you the strain if you tell me color and appearance o.O
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"  I trade a lot on the shitter.  It is the only place my wife leaves me alone.  So yeah I do courtesy flush for my own sake.  You are some kind of analyst predicting how I shit, you must make lots of tendies."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lets put it this way, it has snowed here the past 3 days...   It snowed here on the 4th of July one time..."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I nearly spat out my crayons
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea..... I don’t use Robinhood any longer. Started with it awhile back and moved on.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t the need to disclose lending shares? Other brokers you have to enable lending a share...
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you hahaha
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"they should have some addendum too, this happens with RSU payments. 

just don't file your taxes when you sell and count them as free,"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unless it drops before he sells, he's still up more than if the options expired without exercising right?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You're thinking of the SEX; totally different agency.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Reading up online and just diving in with cheap stocks to see what happens. I still have much to learn though.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t fall asleep on the expiration date for one. But honestly, look for trends and manage your risk well."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I dislike how much cash I have on hand. I do not recommend it. 

I am looking to invest almost $300,000 in real estate in the next 18 months so, otherwise I would probably be at 3% overall cash instead of 6 or 7%. 

That said I’m bearish right now. If we see another event like last March accompanying a GME squeeze then I’m ready to buy"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Im a plumber. Get rid of the blue tabs. Eats away the rubber seals. Casues leaks... seen thousands of dollars worth of repairs because of them.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was about 10 years ago, so I can't say I can describe it too well beyond ""gross"" and ""dark-ish"" lol."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes- he would have lost all options he paid $4k for, opposed now he’s only down $2.7k. 

GameStop has to hit $205 for him to break even. 

I do think op said somewhere he intended on selling the options. As of Thursday he could have sold the options he bought for $4k for $4k, breaking even. But now he’s down."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Your mistake is thinking I think. You retarded ape. I'm retarded.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol tx, I appreciate it"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I change the guts of my toilet every couple years.  Have done tons of plumbing and remodeling myself.  Worst thing that happens is I fix a subfloor, which is totally worth not trying to reason with my wife."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know about the second half of your post but I know that Robinhood does show your ""break even"" price per share on the options and factors your option's cost into that."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Would it more likely have been filled if using another broker?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Can be same thing. Mushy banana. Ape mistake in dark.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Go for it!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Go ahead and explain rationally why robinhood is so terrible.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes- when you’re buying the options. But it does not calculate what you paid for the contracts into the average cost, or total return figures of the shares you purchased by executing the options. If it did, u/finitelite would be down ~$2.7k, not up $1.3k."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure. I’ve not don’t a lot of issues trading and I have to admit I’m chicken so I trade options for long term contracts, so usually stuff 1+ month out. I’ve never gotten close to the contract date on any of mine so I wouldn’t know."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you didnt get the joke yet, ""cleaning out the bathroom"" is code for a gnarly poo. Everybody's gotta go cause it's a hazardous zone."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thinking of buying shares on Monday - do you think it’s a sketchy FOMO at this point or do you think this is just  starting to really move towards its proper valuation?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is $35c 4/16 safe? First time buying options, thinking of starting with ASO."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What the heck is that line below the total return
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Very good should I do the same as you?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,As much as sir jack lot
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Volume just recently picked up this last week. This isn’t financial advice, but my personal opinion is that ASO is just now coming into the spotlight and will continue to go up. DD on the company looks promising long-term as well"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I think 32-35 price target is reasonable. If someone has to covered could go to 35-40. I like the stock and fundamentals of the company
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You can do better than me. I hedge a lot of my positions. Just aim for 15-20% returns
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sweet, I’ll keep a close eye Monday morning. It sounds like many people think it will spike - I just worry about buying in during the spike and having it drop down but this even seems like a good long term investment"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I use the premium from selling the calls to pay for my buys and still keep some profit from the covered calls
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"But if the calls you bought get itm, that means your shares would be called away at the lower strike and you'll miss out on gains greater than the premium you kept. If I'm understanding you correctly, you are essentially mixing a covered call with a credit call spread. One is of course bullish and the other is bearish..."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks to Gamestop, the human race is about to put the first apes and kitties on the surface of Mars. God speed to you sah!"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,FUD
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,if we all buy a few amc shares on monday with the new rules on the market then the rocket would have to go off? no financial advice
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,truth. AMC a close second
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, AMC aint going anywhere"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't bother. These clowns turned their back on AMC when they saw all the FUD. And then turn around and tell you not to believe the FUD surrounding Gaymestop.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You caught half my drift
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I am super excited about the prospect that the person who bought 20mil shares from Gilbert was Buffett, who has indicated recently interest in the stock, as well as indicated he has started taking a large position in an as-of-yet undisclosed company. I think if that gets announced a big jump in price will happen."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I only have a few hundred shares left in AMC as ive pushed everything into GME.  Thinking about takin a hit on monday and just dumping the rest into GME so i can start focusing on building position on BB.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,$GME is the only thing here with potential?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shiz that'd be nice! I am confident it at least trades sideways, aside from bumps - that'd be a game hanger thou"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You too? Haha… knew I wasn’t the only Ape
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Took my hit Thursday, got out at 9.99, realizing a $1000 loss. Still have the 3 4/9 $8 protective puts I bought. If it tanks hard enough, I could make my $1k back there. Still kicking myself for not dumping it at 14 for a gain."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"How many shares were ""unloaded"" by insiders? Can you tell me?"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc/insider-activity
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I already know the answer: not many.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok agree to disagree but it's saying 34M shares sold by insiders last 3 months.  The CEO sold 500k of his 750k.  Do what you want with that info.  I don't have any positions in AMC.  I made a quick buck on the first run up.  Good luck to retail.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,good
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind that separate social media sites that are also being used to track interest in stocks have also reported declines in GME interest as well. Keep drinking that copium though.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,All in MVIS !!!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ummm that’s exactly how this sub works. We don’t know what green is.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Been patiently waiting for Monday to roll around so I can get buck wild on some ASO.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,AMD so gangster
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you believe the audacity of those 🌈Mods?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it would be WAY higher if we didn't delete all the absolute garbage threads that are basically just ""who's still holding GME!?!"" followed by 500 rocket emojis.

That said, our rules don't target specific tickers unless they're below $1B market cap.

If anything GME is probably underrated here because a lot of the conversation has moved to the megathread which isn't captured here. So take the visualization with a grain of salt."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,LMFAOOO
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"LoL, so 30 million deep in the money calls on GME looks normal to you?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’ll be all the talk once Lidar PR or BO news drops.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell weekly puts on PLTR. Only way to make money from it. Trades sideways.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I just keep buying PLTR
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC shorts are immune to theta and IV. Interest is dirt cheap right now too.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly most of them are so weird i was wondering if there might be bots as well. I mean, all post history deleted except for the past 2 months of non stop gme hype and emote spam? It's odd."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thx bby ur the best
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Conservatives like Biden never met a spy technology they didn't like. PLTR is that perfect sweet spot of plausibly deniability for enabling drone strikes and also high tech that won't get you in trouble for supporting monopolies like Amazon or Google.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,i feel attacked
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I mean the hedge funds are long in GME right now, and making bank selling calls to idiots. They keep the price stable at max pain for 3 weeks rolling now. Selling strangles is where its at."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"the divide and conquer strategy worked so well this time with gme. with silver they timed it really well, but it was debunked quickly as a community (no one really fell for it anyways). this gme thing has tons of people fooled and it really is a shame."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought at 8 sold at 14.50 ish. Everything posted in amc sub is literally ripped from gme. Shits weird as fuck. Then random twitter accounts being praised that state gme has squeezed? Nah fam. If I'm wrong on gme then so be it but amc is pure bullshit imo.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ugly sister of GME that nobody wants lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Uh huh. Ok.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s with all the gain porn. Totally inappropriate. Just chill and Hodl. Reveal nothing.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember when you guys were blaming ladder attacks LMFAO
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ken’s too busy begging his ex wife’s boyfriend to quit giving it to her like a champ.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme go berrrrr
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh, a fellow private bank member, I see."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I was a former Wells Fargo holder and customer-(pause as i was also a victim of unauthorized account created in my name). Strangely  they’ve survived some brutal payouts for Class action suits- often the Phoenix rising of the banking industry .
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hubris... 🤲💎🤲🇦🇺
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember the first GME hearing when they asked DFV if 40 dollars was a good price point? He said yes it is a great price point and undervalued. There was clearly laughter coming from the other talking heads maybe kenny g. Clearly they believed that 40 dollars was overpriced and was on its way down. Also at the same time “experts” on tv were pricing it at 8-12 dollars. Clearly they underestimated the apes!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"My opinion from what I’ve been absorbing for the last few weeks, is that they didn’t have enough liquidity even then.  Everything is propped up by something else and you can’t just take out the jenga piece without knocking over the whole tower.

They would have had to sell shit and take a huge hit to pay all their shorts off.  So instead, they’re hiding and scrambling to pass the buck before the whole thing blows up."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Also a HUGE amount of arrogance.  They believe they are superior to retail traders and they assumed that retail traders had no stomach for a fight and would paper hand it all away.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They probably shorted much more than we even dare to think. I’m guess 1000%+
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"To end the short positions, the majority of the hodlers would have to sell their shares.

Example: if a HF thats heavily shorted managed to exit their position and buy millions of shares when it was ~$40, either they got it from us apes (they didnt get it) or they’d be buying from a market maker or other HFs who was just replacing them on their short position... so net net, the shorts are still there bc a lot of us didnt paper hand"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"They don't care about losses,they know they will get bailed out and admitting defeat is bad for their resume."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"They did in large part according to all the data I've seen. They used to be 140%. Now its closer to 25-30%. 

Also, not all shorts are the same, but they all are lumped together in one reported number. Shorting at $300 is a dramatic difference from someone who shorted at $50 a few weeks ago."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They did...
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,As a Canadian who's premier is a piece of Conservative trash also named Kenny I find myself saying that A LOT
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, geez... Do you think I should sell my GameStop shares?

Oh gosh, ah geez..."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"100,000k minimum ape gang strong 🦍 ooh ooh ah ah"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,And the exciting part is with the new dtc rule coming out they can’t hide the shorts anymore. Houston prepare for liftoff
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They forgot that a lot of us never forgot 2008.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read one well written DD that said it's quite likely over 10,000%"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,how do you know?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,enlighten us oh all known
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Three. Guilty as charged.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Porsche / one company made the HF pay them 10bn.
It was very clear to the regulators that the short HFs could not physically borrow their shares to cover the shorts. 
Porsche didn’t loan out the shares so had them by the balls.

Here is different as all the big index funds (Blackrock etc.) are lending out their shares and the regulators are not doing their job. 

It’s similar but not the same."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The first part of your post basically. I don't know but it seems naive to think they would just ignore giant losses approaching them.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you forsee this ending?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,so you actually didn't know but said they did?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,why are the losses on GME shares capped at the share price they were sold to?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this will be a long stand off. The longs have the power tho and it depends what the average short price is. We really could be in the same position in 3-6 months time.

The regulators really should intervene as I believe some hedge funds are selling naked shorts which is illegal. You can fail to cover but if it’s happening over 10+ days there is a problem."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, as a response to 'how can these idiots not cover' it seems pretty important to consider the 'they did' outcome"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Because the lender can't lose more than they were worth when they gave them to the short. The potential losses for the lender are finite. The potential losses for the short are infinite.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Cheers!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,just because you can consider an outcome doesn't mean it is the actual outcome
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I’ll sell for small gains on GME and their bankruptcy will help deflate prices for a bit. Good advice."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"but don't lenders have potential to lose nothing at all? after all the lenders are the ones who are collecting interest. it's the person who borrows the share, then sells it off hoping to buy it back at a lower price, the one who's losses are infinite"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You just explained yourself why GME to 100k and other bullshit price targets aren't possible. After the shorts have blown up, there's nobody left with an obligation to buy GME. Those shorts don't have the financial firepower to bid GME up to that value in case of a short squeeze.

Lenders can lose the shares if the short fails to deliver them back. They were worth something after all. Yes, they collect interest, but there's a reason why they margin call the short if he's underwater. They still want their investment back. I'm all for the GME shorts getting obliterated, especially after the bullshit that saved them in January (as I was in GME myself back then), but people have to stop pulling these unrealistic price targets out of their ass."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,so what would you say is the target price when they buy back?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's total guesswork, but it's not 100k as that would require shorts to have up to 5.5 trillion in capital. Everyone needs to make up their own mind unless you're actually in for the long haul as a long term investor and want the company to succeed (dfv is this kind of investor, but his buy in is in the 20s and he has over 10 million in cash). Dreaming about Lambos before the cash has settled has destroyed many wsb accounts in the past."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMAT, ASML and LRCX are the real winners here.

Fuck all the nerd talk shit with ARM and arguments over companies like MU v AMD v Apple v Intel and the gritty deatils of their designs etc. etc.  Who gives a shit? You're overthinking it. Don't pick chip designers and makers, the winners are chip equipment suppliers because they're agnostic to the competition. They all need equipment to make chips.  Applied Materials is at the center of the solution to the entire chip shortage problem, regardless of what chip company you're talking about.  AMAT is an absolute beast of a company. Incredible balance sheet, back log of demand for their products, and massively bullish forward guidance. Guess who wins from TSM spending $100B AND from INTL spending $20B addressing the chip shortage?  AMAT benefits from both because they supply both companies with equipment."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think its important to emphasize that 10nm/7nm are marketing numbers. Ironically they used to make Intel look good, and now that it makes them look bad, they're looking to move on from that type of measurement altogether.

Regardless, Intel is much denser and that's whats most important. Denser = better.

Estimated peak densities (million transistors per mm2) at:

TSMC 16nm 28.2

TSMC 10nm 52.5

TSMC N7 (7mm) is 91

TSMC N5 (5mm) is \~171

TSMC N3 (3mm) is \~290

Intel 14nm 37.5

Intel 10nm 101

Intel 7nm \~200-250

&#x200B;

Note that these are peaks. Critical logic isn't made at peak densities.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The answer is yes. AMD had an ARM based server division a few years back when no one cared. Now I’m sure they have clients who want it. Intel would be stupid to not enter. There will be 3rd party OEMs that will want the cachet of having an Intel ARM chip in there mobile device. 

The goal of ARM in the data center, desktop market, and mobile phone market is to stream line development cost and increase code base efficiency. Today, mobile drives the server market, not the other way around."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,TBH my biggest fear is Amazon/Apple opening their own fabs but I don't think their shareholders would be too happy with spreading themselves that thin. Samsung can because it's the nation's powerhouse. Too much room for competition here in the states.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Nvidia does acquire ARM (highly unlikely) China would be blocked from making chips and they're not gonna react kindly. Take that as you will.

There is nothing stopping Intel and AMD from producing ARM chips except for themselves. They already have the licenses and will begin developing when ARM is past its infancy in the data center world. Let deeper pockets be the pioneers, let all the software transitions happen (x86 software is not compatible with ARM), then poach their engineers. Intel and AMD are sitting back and letting AWS and Apple try their hand at ARM on purpose.

IBM thrived on providing services that were being phased out. x86 isn't going to be phased out this decade and Intel will begin ARM chip production for clients in 3 years. IBM is dying, Intel is 3 years away from the start of unrivaled growth and has potential to eventually surpass TSMC as the industry leader in chip production thanks to the gov/mil backing within 20 years.

If you're looking for big gains in the next 2-6 years Intel is probably not the stock for you. It's at a 13 P/E ratio because people perceive it like IBM which is fine with me, I'll keep adding.

No clue what TSMC will plan to do after 3nm to prevent stagnation. For now they are the leader but physics doesn't let you go smaller than 3nm, possibly 2nm. At 3 times less earnings per dollar than Intel and lacking vertical integration... I'll happily put my dollars to work in Intel."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape can’t count but ape no bigger better
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP didn’t ask that? OP was saying why would they use 7nm if 10nm was cheaper and got the job done. Everyone here recognizes that 7nm should (note that it’s only one spec so the nodes could have different specs that outweigh the benefit of being 7nm, like transistor density) be better than 10nm, but 7nm is also more expensive.

This isn’t a matter of customer’s interpretation vs reality. This is a matter of unnecessary quality vs lower costs.

If two nodes are identical in every regard except one is 10nm and the other is 7nm, then the customer is absolutely right in preferring the 7nm."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Applied Materials?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh wow thank you so much for enlightening me about that. Are there any specific articles you recommend reading more about them?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"As pointed out, the server and laptop markets are what's ripe for the picking for AMD. And you better believe people/companies running server farms and designing/producing laptops are putting plenty of research before making purchases of that scale. As far as investment goes, having your own fabs is great, until it's not, like we've seen over the past 3 years. What tips the scales in AMDs favor IMO is their involvement in GPUs as well as CPUs. Their current gen GPUs are actually pretty solid pound for pound, but lack features like DLSS, NVENC, CUDA etc. If they get the software tools figured out, and are able to meet demand, they could have a valuation above Nvidia."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh lol. Isn’t it pretty typical for companies to immediately drop after earnings? Like for no reason at all. Pretty bold play haha.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Articles can probably explain better than I can.  [Here's one that gives an idea (with a nice diagram) of how it's different from FinFET.](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/291507-samsung-unveils-3nm-gate-all-around-design-tools)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's geekbench results out for engineering samples though which are usually somewhat reliable. Regardless intel doesn't need to really make a comeback, they have increased profits every year for a while now. Obviously this could change but if I was intel I still really wouldn't be worried. They are in a way better position then amd was 5 years ago"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also waited to get myself an amd laptop (2500u which I know is shit compared to what's out now) because I wanted the strong integrated gpu. Intel is closing the gap rapidly for integrated graphics tho. Also as far as efficiency for enterprise you are absolutely right which is why the industry is creeping towards arm and custom silicon like AWS's graviton chips which are even more efficient then the newest epycs. One last thing enterprise also cares a ton about is support, and while AMD has made strides here intel is just too large to outcompete on this front"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup that's a good point. MOBOs too. You can build a whole system with AMD stuff. Like I said, I don't really think you can go wrong with either long term. Might as well get some Nvidia too!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey thanks so much Naskin, have a great weekend!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"In YoY revenue growth, Intel is up 23% from 2018-2020. Meanwhile, AMD has gone up 72%. 45% in 2020 alone. In terms of market share (via passmark), Intel has gone from 81.9% to 60.5% (2017-2021) and AMD has gone from 18.1% to 39.4%. These latest gen chips are only going to accelerate that. Analysts are already expecting a decline in both revenue -7%, and earnings -13% for intel this year, while AMD is expecting an increase in revenue +38% and earnings +53%."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that's because Intel is the market leader atm it wouldn't even be possible for them to grow at the same rate as AMD. I'd also argue that the laptop surge from covid is what drove their insane sales last year and the reduction analysts are forecasting is just a regression back to the mean but Im at work and can't check their financials at the moment so I could be wrong. This isn't happening to amd because obviously they are taking market share. Regardless I'm not really sure what your point in that reply which leads me to think we are arguing about nothing really. Competition is necessary and I hope and expect intel will bring that in the second half of this year with alder lake.  Why don't we come back to this conversation in a year and see who is right. 

RemindMe! 1 year ""has intel stopped the bleeding?"""

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was just pointing out the facts that contradict your statement. I realize they can't grow at the same rate, but the rate at which they're falling is what I would be concerned with. I can't see how anyone would be bullish on intel over the rest of the year, so it's nice to chat with someone who has views that don't align with my own. I wouldn't necessarily call that arguing.  It's just nice to talk about something other than GME. Anyways have a good day/night weekend man."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No you're right we weren't really arguing I apologize, I started trying to kick marijuana this week and it's got me very irritable and looking for arguments haha, tbh I should get off reddit until I can be nice. You also have a good one!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was looking at DFV last yolo update post, when I realized dude's got 500 call options with a strike price of something like 12.    Expiring April 16th. Someone will need to pony up 50,000 shares to sell to him for 12 lol. He has 11mil Cash position so certainly he is going to execute for the shares.

If they were naked on that sale, it might cause a bit of a bump up in price."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Everybody's GME holdings are making my 3 shares look like a peasant's pocket change 😭
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So is purchasing some stock in GME still worth it ?? I see all these fantastic accounts and I am envious yet happy and proud for these individuals . Just wanted to see opinions and see if it is still worthwhile and how many to even start with buying regarding shares . I am a noob to this all
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,400 in one account and 375 in other

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No hope for us small share holders
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,For a moment there I read it as 1 million shares. That was trippy.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,31
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s really crazy how much money you guys have in this company. Just in the first 10 posts there’s been over 6 million. Make sure you sell this bitch and don’t get caught holding the bag. Although f it, I paper handed the first one and could have squeezed another 50k out of them but would have probably sold at 200 anyways."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought $1 of GME weeks ago just because it makes it easier to calculate the gain or loss when I look at it in the morning. No regrets, man. No regrets."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Those shares were likely bought a long time ago by whoever is on the hook.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Some of us only have 3.. you are sitting pretty bud
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel the same lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I have about the same but I’m tripling down on Monday
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a big e-dick
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It might
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, $500-$1000 range is my realistic short squeeze scenario. I'll be watching closely and if it gets to $1000 I'll take some profits to cover cost but will leave the lion's share on the table I case we really do get to 5 digit numbers"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"500k. 

Short squeeze means indefinitely squeeze potential, theoretically. But with the amount they have shorted, big institutions won’t sell they shares (I think they can only sell 10% before they need to file paperwork and it takes a bit), and there’s r\GME that will hold til the moon because retail owns the float. 

Furthermore, during the squeeze, there will be block trades sent out at a certain price and if it doesn’t get fulfilled, it moves up in price. 

[Here’s a link to a comment that explains why it can reach whatever price YOU want better than I can explain. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mihn43/this_is_not_investing_this_is_not_even_gambling/gt5tmsb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)

The Ferrari gives you more control and let's you actually drive the car, the lambo practically does everything for you, if that makes sense. Naturally, the R8 didn't even compare. I'm sure with all the driver aids off they're more similar, but at that track you had to have them all on. The Ferrari just felt faster, I was sure I had my best time in it, but my fastest was in the Lambo. Anyway, my inner child must have a lambo someday anyway, they were my original dream cars."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not medical advise, I just like the kidney"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool 13 here
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I’ll probably sell some to cover my costs but definitely gonna stay in the casino for the jackpot"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This never happens, the SEC will halt trading and settle in a closed door session long before you eclipse 1k a share.

You aren’t living in reality if you think 500k a share is possible"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol @ 200k per year. That’s FatFire territory. I’m going for that but most people don’t need nearly that amount.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Love it. Good call
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm at 55. But that'll be going up until the squeeze, slowly but surely!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Same plan for me. I will sell maybe 10 shares at 1k and hold many many more
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would absolutely destroy the image of America. Trust me, I’ve had my doubts about this too but I don’t think it’s in the best interest of America to interfere with this. 

With all the current events going on, the *last* thing America needs is the final straw. If the government steps in, people will take their money elsewhere and people around the world would take their money elsewhere (cough China cough). Remember, this is a global issue now, not just an American problem.

Edit: taxes as well. Not to mention the vast majority won’t hold til those numbers so the payout who be as big as you think."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not financial advise. But sure!

Or you could buy 100x more shares, and only need a $230 increase to retire happy.

Sounds like a no Brainer to me."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Me
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"He did say he was in Vegas, that's got to count!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If squeeze Hasnt squoze in like 3 weeks I’ll be dumping like 5k into gme
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No it wouldn’t, it’s happened plenty of times before. 
Letting large funds that hold teachers pensions, 401k, municipal debt bust, now that’s how you lose an election.

Look at how LTMC or AIG were unwound or any other failed bank. 

And I think the exact opposite, if regulators don’t step in and people not directly involved get hurt because some funds and market makers go bust our image of stable financial markets will be harmed long term.

SI is surprising low, so none of this is ever going down. But yeah there’s 0 chance GME breaks 1k a share with out a two week halt, nevermind 10k
(Most bargain brokers tap out on the DTCC deposit long before 1k a share, RH couldn’t get past 350ish)

Not to mention that in this fairy tail land where shares are 10k each, the hedge fund just walks into their prime broker and says I’m out, here’s what I owe ya.
And that’s that, no rebuying of shares"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Let’s see which one of us turns out to be correct
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hodor
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m holding 2 and would love to double it!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm trying to get one share my guy
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or just look to the past, several bargain brokerages couldn’t get past 350, RH top of the list.

What on earth has you believing these places have the money to cover a deposit on even 10k a share?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Same boat
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hang in there homie. It’s all about rate of return.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, you guys are getting whole shares?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm unemployed... are these unemployment numbers from people that have actually found a job or just those who stopped looking?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Like when the unemployment rate was 3.5% and inflation was 1.6% two years ago?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The more I see everyone say this, the more it scares me. This is the kind of thing a hedge fund who wants to sell out of their positions would love to sell into."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So the market will be green so GME will be red
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How many people got jobs
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,And train for six months and they still don't understand how everything works. Now you wonder did you really paid them less?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This^ 

On job training but it needs to be tied into educational institutions so the company cannot sidestep actually  training people. Our company takes on interns. All they do is sit around and haul shit.  One or two make the best of it and climb on equipment and train themselves. It is wrong."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Many people just rolled off the UI tallies counted in this statistic because they ran out of the 1st 6 months of their state claims and had to be moved onto the PUA/PEUC federal programs which aren't counted in the official unemployment statistics even though the large majority of unemployed people receiving benefits are on these extension programs.

Again, the statistic in the OP does not reflect total unemployment. It only shows the # of claims in the front 6 month rolling window. Many more are on extended programs or have dropped out entirely"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wanna believe you really, but please provide evidence to your claim."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy is a genius
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Real Jobs? Or min wage burger flipping manual labour jobs?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes there was a pickup in shit retail jobs. Decently paying job gains are flat.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk if stocking shelves requires six month of training lmao
And yes it was mostly retail."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The whole system is a house of cards. It all started with the government being able to get away with corruption and no one being able to hold it accountable. It started with the constitution and the only way the people can hold the government accountable is through voting(doesn't work) or revolution(doesn't work).

When the constitution was written, it was written for 1776 societies, not 2000's societies, hell, not even 1900's. Back then revolutions were much more likely and easier.  Voting was more legit was it would be easier to validate since there were far fewer people."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They never include things like people of working age that've simply left the workforce .. there's more I'm just but at liberty to type it all out right now
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"As Eddie Bravo would say, look into it"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You realize everything you posted about is likely transient? 

Demand restarted faster than supply was ready to fire up so we have temporary commodity inflation. Vaccine rollout was faster than expected among other factors. On top of that we have had huge injections of 1 time fiscal stimulus. This excess money will be siphoned off via corporate gains that are then transferred and trapped into investment assets. Within a year or 2 we will be back at an equilibrium where inflation is almost entirely a function of wages. 

I've yet to see a single person explain why in the next few years our economy should be stronger than it was from 2015-2019 or why the deflationary trends induced by tech & globalism during that time would reverse from here on out."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If the FED buys the majority of the bonds then the rates don't even really matter the treasury since the FED kicks any interest straight back
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They can't inflate away the asset.  In the end the rich will win.  The motherfucker with 100 million in assets and 90 million in liabilities will walk away with assets now worth a billion and still have that 90 million in debt to be paid back.  The rest of us will be stuck paying 10x for the goods and services his companies produce.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. But papa elon tweeted that and the word has taken a second life
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Spy isn't phased because a ton of the included companies have large amounts of free cash flow which becomes more valuable as rates rise. 

The long duration tech shit with cashflows far in the future are what is getting hammered since there is an increasingly expensive opportunity cost for waiting on those returns"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol when employment was too good they changed the employment figure they used and kept rates at zero.  All this shit is made up as they go.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Just goes to show how insane it was to lower the overnight rate in 2019.  Really gave us a good margin of safety for 2020 lol.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"revolution doesn't work? 

Historically, violence is the only thing that EVER brings about substantial change"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean they could... Russia defaulted on their bonds... I know it's highly unlikely but it is a situation that could occur.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"They already justified the gas tax hike ""it hasn't been raised in a long time""- like it isn't percentage based... crooks."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to pay back your repo loans in a day. It doesn’t effect anything in the long term
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone loses with high inflation. Yes they cannot inflate away your house, but some assets , like certain stocks and bonds for sure, will be hit, and eventually everyone will be hit with the devaluation and debt restructuring downturn."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,bingo
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Remindme! 1 month
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao people really have to ask?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes? If everything a comment says is so painstakingly incorrect, reread it with dripping sarcasm. I just hate the /s convention, people don't need markdown text. 

Also, pulling up sharply with a rounded back is bad for your back. Not to mention trying to hop fences with your bootstraps is ridiculous."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Not yet it ain't!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh hey, you're right. _And_ I'm not banned on this one yet."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um, when a revolution happens it doesn't' fix the society it destroys it. Yes, substantial change... change no one wants until it is pointless. [Yeah, sure, a lot of idiots think revolution will be fun. A total collapse of everything they know. They think it will be like going to the candy store... it will be hell. Go look at what happens in wars by occupying armies... the massive rape of women and children, the torture, the murder, the starvation, the fear, etc. We are not talking about revolution in some 3rd world country]

Seriously, the only out is to destroy everything? That is psychotic. Why the fuck isn't there more ways for the people to fix the government besides voting and revolution? 

Revolution as means to fix the government is the most moronic fucking thing. You literally have to wait until most people are so fed up with all the insanity to get any change and that change then is so chaotic and uncertain that it might lead to something. Anyone that things that is the way for real change is an idiot. Revolution happens when it has to happen... so to use that as the only out besides voting really only leaves one with voting... and that fails after a certain threshold has been crossed.

Revolution in 1776 is NOT the same as Revolution in 2020. The more successful a state initially is the more it grows and the worse revolution becomes as a means to rectify any failings of the state. Destroying the state is not a rectification, it's a last resort.

We are precisely in this mess because there was no other means to rectify the failures of the state except through voting, which is a failure in and of itself."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course wealth is up given the trillions in cash distributed via Unemployment & other fiscal stim. 

Those are 1 time events though so on a longer timeframe those gains will not be sustained. Most of that money will not flow back to the initial recipients after several cycles through the economy"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The thing about this is; most of this isn't going to lead to a significant net increase in consumer spending power. Almost all of these people are rolling from unemployment programs (that have run consistently since last March) that payed state + fed + extended. So each new job is only adding at net WAGE - UI and not just +WAGE. For the worst jobs the equation will be negative where UI > WAGE. 

These numbers alone don't tell the whole story especially long term."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a reason the US literally goes to war to defend the US dollar's status as the world reserve currency.

You cannot compare the Venezuelan dollar to the USD; they are extremely different"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The US government cannot default on their own bonds, and we are not in debt to any country in any form that is not denominated in US treasuries.

Russia’s situation in the 90s is dissimilar to the United States because of two important factors.  First that the Russian economy was not diversified away from oil and gas, and second that the Russian government employed a “floating peg” policy that sought to ensure that the ruble-to-dollar exchange rate would stay within a particular range 5.3-7.1 RUB/USD.

In order to maintain that ratio, the Russian Central Bank had to spend their own foreign hard currency reserves to prop up the ruble.  During the Asian financial crisis beginning in ‘97, demand for oil and raw materials plummeted and depleted Russia’s reserves of hard currency - causing the ruble’s value to drop far beyond what the bank’s reserves could support.

This is a massive oversimplification of the situation, but my point is that the US is not in danger of facing a similar financial situation to Russia because our economy and monetary system is so incredibly different."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,We are the world reserve currency so we don't have to worry about maintaining a peg like Russia did back then
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,invest in bit corn futures
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can roll the loans daily though & there is also term repo 

Not all repo is used for purely intraday business"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That has more to do with interest rates which are the opposite of inflation.  Inflation should in theory increase rates but Fed intervention will give us Turbo inflation without the rate increase. Win win for asset holders.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd be impressed if anyone could get banned from this Wendy's. The owners are all cracked out of their minds and they let apes throw poo at eachother in here
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not saying revolution is a good thing or something we should want. I'm just pointing out that historically it has been virtually the only way to make substantial regime changes. 

Literally look at all of recorded human history and you will see that this is the case. The only real outlier is India but the English pulled out there for economic reasons, not because of Ghandi's movement. 

How could voting change anything in the US when the corporations and media have so much control and everyone is tricked into voting for 1 of two parties that are virtually identical. 

anyways, not going to dive into this but if we wanted a totally new form of government in this country it wouldn't happen via voting. We can make incremental changes via voting and maybe that is all we need but there is so much regulatory capture in the United States that i personally believe things are fundamentally broken and the poorer/less fortunate members of society will only ever be pandered to by the elites and given just enough to secure their votes and keep them placated. Just take a look at how occupy wallstreet threatened the establishment so they brought in identity politics to divide the plebs and subvert the movement (eliminating the threat). These companies went from enemies of the people in 2012 to allies of the progressive youth and future of the country. Lots of gaslighting going on by both the dems & republicans (together they form the neoliberal uniparty ruling the United States)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You have no idea what you are talking about
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not going to confirm nor deny those allegations.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,True for the long term but if the vaccines are as effective as they say then it can’t go tits up.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, that growth since Reagan has gone almost entirely to asset prices and the rich while wages remain stagnant."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm learning a lot. Thanks for this comment  gives me something more to read on during my free time
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,USA owes over a 100% of its' GDP to China
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I like mining bit corn the old-fashioned way
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s a win-win in the short-term, but eventually it’s a huge lose — way bigger than 2008."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot of people who lost jobs got pay bumps.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You play my emotions like a fiddle sir. Well done.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong. Just so you know, the correct spelling is [Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi)."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not disagreeing with you. My point is a technical one. Revolution does not change the system, it destroys it(if it is successful). Yes, destruction is change but I mean that if the goal is to repair the system then revolution cannot by it's very essence do that. 
I'm specifically talking about how the constitution(The thing that created the system) forces us to choose voting or revolution.

Essentially all those fuckers did was give us voting. They build a great system but a very flawed system. It had a critical flaw. Just like Chernobyl... how the reactors were designed with a positive void coefficient... solidifying that one day the reactor would have a meltdown. Essentially the founding fathers did the same with the constitution. No matter how perfect they designed any of it, they designed it so that one day it will fail and a revolution would occur(hell, they could have done this on purpose).

What I'm saying is that our founders established the rules about how government was to be created and function. The people were given only two ways to change government, voting and revolution.

Voting no longer works, as you have said. Once the government becomes too corrupt then voting can't work... so now we are only left with revolution.

Now, if enough voters work together they might be able to reverse some of the problems of the government, but it is the *STRUCTURE*(The rules of the game) that are flawed. Just like the stock market, how the rules benefit the psychotic criminals like HF's that use the flaws in the system.

Any government that will succeed must be engineered to do such and must be constantly updated. E.g., take Windows or OSX... they constantly are updated. Imagine having an OS that was built once and it could not be updated. Any flaws would always remain... that is sorta what we have with our government(well, it can update itself but that is like corrupting the data).

The problem is, that any revolution is almost like starting over form scratch. You will have power hungry psychopaths willing to kill others to get power, these people not being intelligent or willing to work with others. They will just create dictatorships using torture and death to control people. That is what the founding fathers forced us to deal with.

Now, with the constitution we still have the ability to change it, it is not impossible. Simply that the more corrupt it gets the harder it gets to change. But if 200M people stood up to the government, all in unity, they could force change ASSUMING they new what to change. The fact of the matter is that most people are imbeciles and have no idea how government or finance works. It's not their fault, they were not taught in school. Nor were they taught engineering, mathematics, psychology, etc... all the things that need to be understood to make a better government. This is why they constantly vote in lunatics because they think the lunatics will save them when the lunatics are the problem. Ultimately the voters are the problem, but no one is to blame. It is what it is."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Real dollars and nominal dollars go Google girl
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,More of a reflection of fiscal policy than monetary policy there.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s good if the government needs to spend money into the economy.  Sovereign currencies are how governments provision themselves.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"of course we can pay it. the treasury can always borrow more from the central bank and the central bank will continue rolling that debt forever. We maintain the world's largest military and have intelligence agencies interfering in every foreign country not for national defense, but to maintain this financial hegemony for our benefit and Israel's."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No worries.  I’m glad I could help.  

I’ve realized that outside of interest rates and debt, even very seasoned investors and financiers don’t have a solid grasp on what our money is, where it comes from, and what it’s real limitations are."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Umm that’s easily proven false.  I’m not sure where you saw that, but the federal debt is structured in the form of US Treasury bonds.  Of the $28Tish of outstanding treasury bonds, China holds about $1T US treasury bonds in their reserves.  It’s important to note that Treasury bonds have a fixed interest rate, and that this debt is not something that can be simply “called-in”.  If China wishes liquidate their position in treasury notes, they could simply sell them on the open market to many other holders of treasury notes."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Na not even close to the case. China actually divested a ton of their UST

Total outstanding UST is about GDP and 1/3rd of those are owned by the FED

FED + US entities like primary dealer banks/pension funds/etc. own the majority"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea and just neoliberalism in general
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"

>	If businesses cant handle a 2.25% interest rate or whatever it was, they shouldnt exist.

Then you get mass unemployment"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not talking about bonds, I'm talking about your national debt, look it up, or better yet, don't, if you can't handle the truth go back to pretending everything is fine, 100%+ of GDP is perfectly fine and normal"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Japan is the way it is because they are the opposite of America, rather than put everything on a credit card, they pay with Debit and only spend what they need to spend, that is what causes a stagnet economy.  Look it up."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The national debt literally is outstanding bonds

The US raises money via the Treasury selling bonds at auction..."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Japan has a high savings rate, they're also the biggest trade surplus nation in the world and largest net creditor. 

The reason Japan is messed up is because central banks never allowed their 1980s bubble to de-leverage. And also the entitlement scheme requires infinite population growth. 


America is able to get away with it because world reserve currency."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Thank you for proving youre a newbie bitch

Esit:checked and confirmed, straight newb"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll be looking for your loss porn as well
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again you don't even know what I am in. You're confirming that you're a gme newb. It's OK, maybe one day in 40 years gme will squeeze"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont have any gme
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure bud, I'd venture to say you don't even trade."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I invest I don't trade its waste of time and money
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"And you're on this sub?!?!?!?!?! 

I'm thinking you need a perma ban"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,For what exactly? I can look at all the loss porn I want
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You just openly admitted to going completely against the culture in this sub. 

Perma fucking ban times a bazillion"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Its not against sub rules
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right! But it is again, against the culture,  don't understand the point of just here for loss porn, if you're that miserable, you must be holding the largest bags ever  or again, nothing at all"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Not holding any bags I'm up right now I thinks it funny to watch a lot of wannabe Jordan Belforts lose money
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck man you're just a straight up pussy then. 

Youre in the wrong sub. 

Hopefully the mods get your broke ass the fuck outta here. Be with us or be out bitch"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah so my tsla puts are fuk?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Baught TSLA on the dips and dont regret it.
Will be buying more. Bullish."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Should I be worried for the 4/9 $780 calls I sold ?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,My strongest conviction is Tesla. The fact there are still so many doubters is a real positive in my mind. The doubters will be invested in like 10 years when Tesla pays a nice dividend.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Monday can't come soon enough.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Some people are still short TSLA. Can you imagine?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't Papa Elon tweet (and then delete) that he thinks TSLA could be most valuable company in a few months 👀
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Full 🌕 Monday!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,so they basically blew out the lowered estimated....TSLA gonna moon on Monday!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit!!  Should be worth 3 trillion
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,$3000 is not a meme soyos
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh no the TSLA stans are going to be even MORE insufferable.

And really I'm just salty because I'm regretting not buying at 600."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I am one of those!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! They increased YoY sales by 100%. Now they only have to keep doing that every year for the next five years to justify the *current* stock price
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It all adds up
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! They increased YoY sales by 100%. Now they only have to keep doing that every year for the next five years to justify the *current* stock price
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla has brought the concept of vapor ware to the automotive industry.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Finally, my 4/16 725/720p credit spread should print......"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Real question 🙋 is what prime broker is ready to offer us 🦍 TRS w/ 50x leverage, preferably before Monday open."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,More importantly where is MY Model S order in January?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,priced in
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s it??
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Jeepers
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,These are election winning results!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, it feels like just the other day when that used to be their annual production"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting questions on their revenue recognition: [https://thelastbearstandingcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/the-robtaxi-repo-2.pdf](https://thelastbearstandingcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/the-robtaxi-repo-2.pdf)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is likely to me is that, left over units from 2020 were sold in Q1 2021."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It really hurt me when selling these ...  


Hopefully will find some more to buy on the Moon or Mars..!!!  


I hear apes thrive up there..."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,And none of them are mine 😭
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,AND still not worth more than 300$/share :)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, these numbers look sad comparing to Voltsvagens projections..."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"For the quarter, Toyota reported sales of 528,813 vehicles, up 20.3 percent on a volume basis.

General Motors Co. announced it sold 642,250 vehicles in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2021,"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm thinking they had vehicles left over from last quarter.
but since the hedgies can borrow vapor stocks, maybe elon is making vapor cars!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"9.2 million in revenue, how much in profit? not a huge deal considering Teslas massive market cap. EV markets are 100% in a  bubble."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn’t they charge people twice? That would check out!!!!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla double dipping and selling the same car twice! Bullish!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Newbie here. Don't @me.;) What doesnt wsb do what they did with gme and do it with tesla instead... And hold the shares ... Or apple stock? 

I feel gme can't sustain these high prices"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,">Estimates ranged from 145,000 to 188,000 deliveries.

not bad, but not a blowout. Worth +2% on Monday fo sho"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Previous quarter production retard 😄
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope that’s not what people were focusing on. “Hey those numbers don’t match”.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Photoshop
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,for some reason I was reading this in Gordon Johnson's voice
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they had 4,800 returns then they were resold 🤷"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol inventory
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy all the calls...
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I live along i80 in wyoming and I see trucks hauling tesla's almost every day. So they're selling somewhere.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Raleigh, NC. These fuckers are everywhere. I plan to join the club ASAP."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold 600p expiring all throughout this month.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,God I hope it goes up again so I can short it again.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Didnt nio produce like 25k cars last year? Lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Democrats aren’t blocking self driving...
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The circle jerk and the market saying fuck you meme stocks says my puts are just fine thanks
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their revenue is still 1/4th of what GM does.  And GM has higher margins.  With Tesla at the bottom of auto quality.  Yet TSLA cap 8x larger.  They still have work to do to match their valuation.  

But as we all know, good stocks and good companies have little to do with each other."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm short and I'm not scared
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,People buy what they can a Ford. But they *want* to buy Tesla.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,One is opening new factories and the other is paying governments to close them.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do i find tesla to be more impressive i think its cuz given the context tesla is on the way to becoming behemoth while ford is about to fade into obscurity.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The diver didn’t just say the sub was dumb.  He told Elon to stick the sub up his ass.  That’s when Elon called him a pedo.  Considering the diver was an old white guy who had moved to Thailand, there’s a good chance it’s true."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah lots of word. Show us your put position or gtfo.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So how much would you price in self-driving?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,🖕
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If you still can't see the value in Tesla's future then good luck staying poor for the rest of your life
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao, spoken like a true poor butt hurt Idiot...."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Vw only sold like ~500 EV’s (id.4) in America, that’s pitiful coming from a major OEM"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,But how many is that is EVs? Like 7?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock market is forward looking
 It doesn't give a shit about current profit, the stock is priced at potential future profit"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's not that many hedge funds betting against them (short selling).

Although Tesla used to be the most shorted stock iirc"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Because we already did! We still are buying and holding! It’s all you newbies who came to the sub late that don’t understand that...smfh. If you see people hating on papa Elon for no real reason that’s how you know they are either bots or stupid newbies that haven’t been here that long and only know about GME.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Forget the range, the average was 170,000"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So despite this news it will still be -3% from Thursday’s high? 

I think it gets to ~700 on Monday"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont you go using logic on them thier interwebs. We will not allow it!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I remember about a year ago, we'd all wake up on any given morning, turn on the news, see ""record breaking COVID deaths this week, job losses are increasing for the fifteenth straight day, Adolf Hitler has been successfully cloned by a terrorist cell, and there's an asteroid on collision course with earth expected to impact next week"" and SPX would be +1.6% at open because ""iT's pRiCeD iN.""

Meanwhile, a year later, it took these twats an entire six fucking weeks and counting to decide whether they're scared of a 0.1% increase in bond yields or not"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Stocks never move. Invest in marmot belly futures.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,11.0 earthquake on an unknown fault line with a 4 mile high tsunami from Lake Michigan...priced in.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If this was true the price would never go up.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hol up, so you saying Apple won't get QuantumScape battery?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair it SHOULD be priced in at this price point ffs.  P/E of over 1,000 and people acting like every Elon tweet or positive news byte should run it up to 2,000 P/E"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your comment reminds me when Nokia’s CEO said of Apple: “we sell more phones in a day than they sell in a year.”

How’s that Nokia phone doing?

Tesla is so far ahead of everyone else as the world moves to electric that one day we will look at Ford, GM, Toyota and laugh how they could not get out their own way moving from ICE to electric.  Business school cases will be written about it. 

Try to buy a Bolt and watch the dealership steer you to anything else."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't forget that OEM manufacturers like Ford have something like a hundred and forty billion dollars in debt
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The 188k wasn't a serious analyst. Bottom 1% on tipranks. Same guy has a price target of $67. He set it that high so he can claim Tesla missed.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSLA has the highest-rated customer feedback. A car company that makes the whole industry change and develops autonomous driving on the side is not a good company? Everyone is free to short TSLA if they think otherwise, sell now and buy in later for cheap."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Define “bottom of auto quality”
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"> $1b in fantasy money that’s now worth just over $2B.

I have $12B in fantasy money. Sadly, it is worth $0B. Not sure how this works."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm just saying the price people are paying for shares of TSLA is far too high. Might be a good business, but it isn't worth $600/share."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It's the best now but there's lots of competition and in five years they won't have all the market share. They are priced as if they will.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If you can’t see that Tesla is a big ass bubble then Good luck staying poor :)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,thats how they sold more tjan manufactured.  the rest is just funny stuff

sarcastically of course"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Other than EPA ranges that don’t live up to reality, where is Tesla beating the competition? They use Panasonic batteries, their FSD is crap compared to waymo, their quality control sucks, the only thing they have going for them is better acceleration."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Only thing floating Tesla is tax credits other manufacturers aren’t getting
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Charging station is hooked to the power grid powered by what? That's right.  Every roofs solar panels can reduce their dependence on utilities, they don't run our grid.  Tesla technicians didn't install all the solar panels in my state, nor to they maintain them.  Every car manufacture out there is coming out with EVs.  Solar companies are abundant and not owned by Tesla.  98% of charging stations in my state are not owned by Tesla.  Your blind bullishness is why TSLA will fall, breaking the dreams of the ignorant."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually laughed out loud when I realized you weren't being satirical.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It got massive media coverage but if you missed that go read rule 4 and why I can’t just say it
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget the green credits they sell to their competition just they can achieve their bare minimum profitability requirements. 

Tesla makes cool cars, but anyone believing they will earn their valuation is fucking stupid."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty sure they had to rip off more systems due to shit Install quality then they actually turned on in 2020. Not to mention all the v2 cancelations, because they are trying to bait and switch customers for the inferior v3 systems."

They've seen a growth rate of around 50% YoY of sales every year for the last 8 years. Sometimes even far exceeding that. When the Model 3 was released they went from 103k sales in 2017 to 245k in 2018, with Model 3 making up 145k of that number.

Q1 2020 they delivered 88k vehicles, where model S and X made up 12k of that number. This years Q1 they apparently did 184k deliveries with production of model S & X shutdown for the whole quarter.

Model Y didn't come out until last year and production, obviously, wasn't ramped up fully.

The fact that they produced 180k vehicles and sold 184k, shows they pretty much still sell every car they produce (they have very little inventory.  They are on track to exceed sales growth of 50% this year again. Which would mean 750k - 800k sales this year.

They're also coming out with Cyber truck and the Semi this year or next, which will hit new segments. Then there's the model that will truly target the mass market at a $25k price point they plan on having in production in 2023. Regardless of if they hit that target, whenever it comes out it is certain to create massive sales growth, because the addressable market becomes that much bigger as seen with the model 3 vs model S and X. The model 3 sales absolutely dwarf them.

My point stands, it's easier to grow when you're dealing with small production numbers. The growth numbers I threw out originally was to illustrate a general point, it's harder to grow substantially when you get bigger. They've been growing big on a % basis, which many small companies do, but they've grown fairly slowly in terms of absolute numbers. Right now, they're still working with small fry production numbers. 

""The fact that they produced 180k vehicles and sold 184k, shows they pretty much still sell every car they produce (they have very little inventory. They are on track to exceed sales growth of 50% this year again. Which would mean 750k - 800k sales this year.""

Which still leaves them as a minor car manufacturer with an unsustainable valuation. As I repeat frequently, my argument is never against Tesla surviving, it's about it being able to sustain it's current valuation. It's competition is beginning to roll out in all the key markets and a key part of Tesla's hype, it's ability to attain global EV dominance (with 40%+ market share) is a a total fantasy unless they attain substantially above 50% growth. Their competitors can change capacity over to EV from IC cars much, much easier and quicker than they can create entirely new factories. 

""They're also coming out with Cyber truck and the Semi this year or next, which will hit new segments.""

I'm honestly not sure that the Cybertruck has legs. It's original pre-order numbers were reported as being lower than expected and there's plenty of much more traditional looking alternatives or immediately compete with ICE for many work related roles. It's Semi, we'll see. There's competitors already in the market (Scania and BYD come to mind), they're niche markets to target and may distract for competing in other areas of the EV market that could benefit from them ramping up production. 

""hen there's the model that will truly target the mass market at a $25k price point they plan on having in production in 2023. Regardless of if they hit that target, whenever it comes out it is certain to create massive sales growth""

Except, their competitors already have cars operating at similar price ranges which are going to be rolled out in the US this year and next year. Their free run in their domestic and some international markets is at and end. 

""There is still ton of growth left.""

There's growth, I don't see the current growth rate being sustainable past the next few years. Certainly not enough growth to justify it's current valuation."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, diversification would mean buying at the top and selling on the way down. Whatever this is, its horse shit."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,At this point you may as well close your eyes whenever you press the buy button.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Dollar Cost Averaging in a way. Lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same same.

Those $40 shares just hit different."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,God damn!!!

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What he is using is Saxo
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I've only been investing exclusively in stocks for the past 10 years but got attracted to the idea of options just last year. Still think stocks are the way to go 95% of the time. GME was a conviction purchase hence the options :)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well this was my yolo account all along. I placed in 15k and just been doing random shit with it. Mostly GME.

Also hope you give me the chance to say fuck you back in the future too.  Hahaha"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How have you done since investing? I’ve only started this month with stimulus money. I’ve been subbed to wsb for a long time sucks i never saw gme posts before it took off $100 plus
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s up about 600k
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Not enough because I see some Ford calls wasting valuable space. Liquidate those to the moon!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Apes together strong!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,When I can Yolo 15k you can tell me to fuck off just to do it lol. I did bang out about 38k on GME. Big trade for an infant account. Now back to modest returns compounding
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m up 120% over the last 3 months.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you miss GME posts if you’ve been subscribed for a long time? GME was literally one of the most mentioned tickers around here since it hit $10.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Well probably 1M or so after tax
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing! we all have hope apes.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Kill joy!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No idea man maybe because I’m
In 100 other subs. Even when it was $100 a share wsb wouldn’t automatically show up in my feed unless I typed it in a bunch. Other theory is they somehow limited recommendations wouldn’t put anything past them"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This beautiful ape is getting a lambo
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It's called printscreen.  Boomer approved
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Awwww damn you right
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The shares were from various sales of options I held expiring in Jan. I also sold a quarter of my holdings at 350 and 400 when I heard about the buy button being deleted. I then proceeded to buy the dip as and when I could and also exercising the options I had expiring in march 

From start to finish I deposited 15k into this new account. That's about it!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, $146 average. Entered a small position at $46, Averaged up at $180ish. Wish I would have gone all in at $46 🥴"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,$4.50 for me but never learned how to sell lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got shares in two Fidelity accts. 
2 @ 110 (IRA)

Anyone know how to calculate combined cost avg? I suck at math (never even passed HS algebra). Thanks!!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I see. I would just go straight to the daily thread and see what’s going on there. GME was posted a bunch in the daily thread since last summer."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That would be pretty epic if we could get Levar Burton to do a reading rainbow video for WSB. Now that I think about it we could just deepfake it.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,he's joking
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you seen the firetruck red crayon? It's missing from my 128 pack with built in sharpener. I can't color sell buttons without it so I just keep having to buy.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you my man. Hope your CSPs are making bank
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That super weird that the best tasting color is missing. I dont think I know it's at buddy, sorry"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, gonna roll my Apr16 to at least July $50P"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rod, I love your work!  Much respect to you!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope you like losses retard.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You'll probably be fine.  Just wait until this stock gets way more volatile later this month and sell the options on a spike.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You used to get banned for asking questions like this...
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sooooo... how tight are you with your wife's boyfriend?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short answer, yes.

Long answer, I'll pray for you but probably still a yes."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I would close out of that slow bleeder and put everything in 5/21 $18 MVIS calls instead: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/minugt/microvision\_investment\_thesis\_and\_summary\_of\_dd/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/minugt/microvision_investment_thesis_and_summary_of_dd/?sort=new)

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should average down and buy another 36.

Then once you have a 100 you can sell some weekly CC."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, what exactly is your exit strategy when your company votes to dilute its shares on May 4th? Do you think the stock will go up? Rhetorical question, but with people who buy calls like that as yolo's - I fear your understanding of the markets is at about 2/10, and because you are above the people who are 1/10, you feel like you're 9/10; you're not.

Instead you have an actual company that has built one of the largest patent moats of today: MVIS. They are about to M&A and release across several verticals (LiDAR, AR, IVAS / HoloLense 2.0). Stop playing kids games with your ape stocks and start doing actual DD, or at least read other people's DD."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Safety squints.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you guys realistically see AMC @ ? How  high do you think it can go ? Obviously speculation buy where do you see it in a year ?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No one is predicting it will be above 12 so it kinda has to lol. It’s based off of what a price will likely do and in this case it’s not expected to be above that. How could he sell it for more if it is not expecting to be above 12? Unless it was...
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No a split is something different. This is just an add.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"$5 or so?  They were struggling pre pandemic, have debt in excess of cash and continue high exec payouts.  AMC is not GME"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s wrong about this particular option tho. I was talking about one option not all of them. He’s just trying to sound/ look good.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol $5? That’s funny. We’re already double that and there’s a huge opportunity for a squeeze. Why do you think the media is bashing AMC so hard? Literally we’re being hit harder than GME is and it’s for good reason. I can’t wait for it to pop and everyone talking against it regrets all their shit talk. The only reason we had a dip recently is because of all the FUD the media is spreading about the 500m share dilution when it hasn’t even been voted on yet 😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was an AMC shareholder from $8 until $13.  I would feel some FOMO if AMC mooned and I love my local AMC theater.  AMC needs to issue those shares to survive.  That’s why it’s baked into the price, it’s not FUD."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This statement is just not true. There is no need for an additional vote and there are no SEC rules to my knowledge that limits the issuer of a stock to a certain amount per quarter.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This rule applies to affiliates, not the issuing company"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol no they don’t. It’s not even their goal to issue the shares to survive. They have enough cash on hand to survive this entire next year not to mention the large amount of profits they’re already experiencing from re-opening. And yes it is FUD. Media lying to the public saying that “CEO Adam Aaron to issue 500 million shares” which is a straight up lie. Adam clearly explains the reasoning for the share approval and also states that it’s not even something they would utilize anytime soon. And even if they did it would require an additional share holder meeting to do so. What does all this mean? It means that we have A LARGE AMOUNT OF TIME TO STILL SQUEEZE. Moon tickets are a lot cheaper on the AMC rocket and if you actually do your own personal DD instead of listening to all the FUD being spread by the media you would realize that.

I’m not going to argue either. Just remember this comment when AMC squeezes. That’s all I ask. If I end up being wrong, then I’m wrong. But all of the numbers and facts point straight to a squeeze just like GameStop and you have to me ignorant to believe otherwise."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,https://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-20-rule-offers-greater-clarity-and-flexibility-nasdaq-listed-companies
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This rule does not apply to public offerings and has nothing to do with your argument. It simply states that if a company wants to issue more than 20% of its stock in OTHER than a pubblic offering (such as selling a significant stake to another company) for less than market value of the day before or medium of the last five trading days they will need to hold a shareholder vote. Doesn't apply in this case.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So the play is long equities (via futures or w/e) and short bonds (via ZB or ZN or w/e)?

Not very good risk parity there.

What's your directional opinion on the following:

* /ES
* /NQ
* /RTY
* /ZB
* /GC
* /6E
* /NG
* /ZS"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ageing well so far. NFPs came in at 916,000 (!!!)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Equities are questionable... if yields rise moderately, that's good for stocks. If we get another tantrum like last week, then equities not so good. 

/ZB and /ZN honestly I treat the same. I don't expect the 10/30 differential to suddenly blow out, but of course /ZB would do worse. I just do /ZN because way more liquid. 

/GC and /6E I honestly don't know. You got the yield story, but again you have inflation. 

Commodities you just get lucky or you get bankrupt. Fixed income is the clear play in these next 6mo or so"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,">Equities are questionable... if yields rise moderately, that's good for stocks. If we get another tantrum like last week, then equities not so good.

XLNX is merging with AMD.  Every XLNX share will be converted into 1.7234 shares of AMD.  AMD is currently worth $81, so a share of XLNX should be worth $139.  But it isn't, it's $130, because there is a small risk the deal wont go through.

The last major hurdle to the merger is the shareholder meeting on April 7th.  So take your 4k and buy 20 $132 XLNX calls exp 4/9.  If the price goes to $139 after the meeting, you go up 350%."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Right but I took that money out of AMC options put it into GME and got lucky with the first squeeze. And we are here now
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You think it’s gonna go up 25% in the next few months?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,25% yes. Maybe even a lot higher.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You have time bro
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you chase it when it was mooning during the squeeze hype?

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're completely wrong.  Here's what you do-- you wait until your position is worth about the same as a pizza dinner.  Then you sell it and buy pizza with it.  Then you eat the pizza, and as long as you can fool your brain into thinking ""Wow, this pizza tastes as good as a $16,000 pizza!"" then you're not some idiot who lost their money in the stock market-- you're just a guy with a very refined pizza palate who maybe spends a little too much on his pizza hobby.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he holds, then yes, all that happens is he loses what little is left.  Which isn't much compared to the ~16k he's already down."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The red is showing the loss of my premiums, just  around $16.5k, because I have a total of 20 contracts.  The options will not be exercised and will expire worthless, unless I can sell the contracts and clawback some of the loss in the next couple of months.  I have other accounts/ position, so this doesn’t ruin me.  I didn’t use anything I couldn’t stand to lose.  I do, however, recognize that these positions weren’t purchased using proper due diligence.  These were purchased because I was trying to ride the wave at the time, and I just went for it.  I’ll be spending time considering why I used greed as a reason to make a purchase, when I knew already that wasn’t a good reason.  I let it slide this time and paid the price.  Lesson learned, and I’ll be spending time in the future developing my trading skillset using this lesson.

Edit: a word"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I did
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,or at least buy LEAPS. all the meme stocks are tainted in the eyes of the average joe investor and will be for quite some time.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy more OP. What's a couple hundred bucks more to average down your position? If it turns around and pops back up your break even will be much lower. You could actually make more too.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"50% if I can salvage at least 1k. 

And put that shit on a 0DTE SPY call and hope for the best"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks man. Good job and good luck
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't read.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The problem I have is that when you buy an option 2 months out and the stock drops 5% within 2 days the option drops 20%. A stock like NIO a 5% drop is only $2.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The way prices are calculated on options is a subject noobs really need to read up on. one jackass making low bids on a low volume option strike can really fuck with your head.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's pretty low IV for GME though, lowest is seen since January was like 140"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,My positions are in the final paragraph.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol that's why he said drywall. And it depends. I'm a skilled laborer but the products I install are sold in big box stores at less than my cost from manufacturers. The only way to make money is by trying to be the company contracted for a region so that you get all of the work. You could try buying them at the store and not up charging, but here's the thing. You won't be able to offer the same price for labor because you don't have 3k+ jobs a year coming in. So where's the consumer going to go for the contractor? The store offering a lower price for the labor. Not Jonny Dingus and his rusted rape van in the phone book charging double. Plus the store pays us far more than what they charge to the customer. So in any industry where suppliers are in bed with retail, the cost of labor will probably go down."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol Johnny Dingus coming back with a vengeance after reading this
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,He's gonna John Wick me for bursting the bubble he got after reading yours
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So from what I read the biggest thing going for them it seems like is qnx and cars. This is only what others have said, but they say qnx is a bitch to work on, can anyone weigh in on this? I know they're already in 100 mil cars so it does seem promising."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL, you would think that being up 80% was a good time to at least cover some, but no, greed got the best of me. Lessons learned, I am just glad I didn't do a YOLO play on money I cannot afford to lose."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"80%, if its good enough to screenshot its good enough to take profit from!!!!!!"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buyers of Options contracts end them in one of three ways. 1) They expire worthless (the strike price is still above (for calls) or below (for puts) the current mkt price.
Or they still have value in which case they are either

 2) Exercised (bought or sold at the contract price; in this case 50,000 shares can be bought at $12 a share), and he would own 50k more shares of stock.

Or 3) the contract can be closed. In which case he would get the current mkt value of the contracts he bought way back when for .20 each for $10k and sell(close out the contract) for $181.30 each and get $8.948 million. 

Note: a) as the buyer(owner) of the options contracts he could have done # 2 or #3 at any time before the Apr 12 expiration date. 

B) the ‘other side’ of an options contract is not a call/put or vice versa. The buyer is betting the direction of the stock will go up(call) or down (put), and pays a premium to the other side. That $ is all the seller of the options contract gets. 

When one buys a call option, they pay a premium; the “other side” ‘writes’ or sells a call option, and gets the premium.

When one writes or sells an options contract, they either have the 100 shares of the underlying stock (for 1 contract), which would be a ‘covered’ call or put; or they don’t (a naked call or put).

I’ll just leave that naked call dangling there..."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"er .... there's also the fact that if he sells them there's no guarantee they get exercised and therefore his long position that already exists is risking a decrease in value as that would be .. handing market makers a lot of free money, whereas if he exercises and immediately sells  even to pocket some gains, it still forces them to keep those shares allocated to cover him which while they are already hedged, are not insignificant to the big picture....if you look at a chart correlating days to cover and price, here's a hint, the price doesn't skyrocket at the apex of days to cover. guess when it goes up the most. of course that would be strictly squeezing shorts and this is more thinking on gamma squeezing but..yeah sure, no relation between any of those things. i guess he'd just not think about any of that and blindly give back a handout to marketmakers potentially at the detriment of all of us and also his long position. you don't even need to be altruistic for being altruistic to benefit here.  and mostly you just need to be shortsighted or spiteful not to. there's no advantage to selling to anyone but the MM if it's in the money at expire in this case. liquidate at the pop on the open if that's your bag....i think that covers the retardation in your bearish position well enough. did you sleep through what's going on or are you just that heavily underwater from shorts

https://termbin.com/8hti6

source: nasdaq daily short exempt/short/totalvolume. prior to 2017 / that first record, they don't break out short exempt individually so i was just trying to get some idea of things generally and also i'm interested in short exempt as well, so...yes. the entire exchange data for 2019 is obviously not listed in this termbin. but, if you wanted all the daily short exempt and short and total volume that is both the order of appearance right in that sentence fragment there, and the entirety of them traded in the regular session on NYSE since near end of july 2017. there is a metric fuckton of other short data kicking around, but..tis hilarious when they're dumping bonds at the clip they were a few days in to february to come up with more shares to short...it was a wee bit over the average lololol. if this shit isn't shorted to oblivion already again , it's shorted to past oblivion already again. that or i'm terrible at maths and out of my depth both of which are absolutely true no matter what so ymmv. i did this math with sed, grep, piped in to bc, and a bash loop"

I recognize the safe, logical play is to lock in some profits at some point, which was actually part of my original plan... but at this point, fuck it dude.  After all the learning I’ve done over the past few months... could $1million+ per share really be possible?   Can that really be pulled off?  Is all of this really happening??

NO POLITICS"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Cite the political party or affiliation from the previous statement. There isn't one. Neither are their policy recommendations or any references to any present day political system. Disliking the actions of individuals is not politics and reading something you disagree with is not politics. History is not politics. Comparisons are also not politics. Maybe familiarize yourself with the word.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they said if you were a gear head there are even better cars to buy than these but they're not a car aficionado. Again, it's not *really* about the car - it's about the frivolousness of buying these out of boredom. Also I don't know who these women are dating men for their exotic cars. I'm a woman, I've worked with men that drive these cars. Just, no thank you. It is definitely a kind of person: his time is more valuable than yours (in his mind), you're already wasting his time, and you should immediately feel like the luckiest woman in the world because he happened to find you attractive. I don't know what about this women find appealing but no thanks."

And who also is very threatened by your competence, does not take an interest in your life, will be jealous if you succeed, etc etc. Just wants you on their arm because you make them look good. To each their own it just doesn't seem very authentically satisfying. Also sure not *all* men who drive exotic cars are like this, but it's not uncommon."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats not my point. I know I genuinely loved my last girlfriend, and she acted the same in return. But when the cards were down, it was clear I was just a stable option, not someone who genuinely cared about me."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't saying that was your point. My point on the exotic car buying trope, he typically sees women like another flashy thing to bear witness to his almighty ego. He typically has a wife, a girlfriend, a side chick and others. He flirts with and probably more with the girls in the administrative roles at his office and very much despises having women in his field a la me. He brags about all the women in his life to the boys at work (and I have overheard these conversations). He's usually pretty decent looking but his personality is so toxic it's difficult to imagine that people find him appealing and he is goddamn positive every woman who's ever seen him immediately creams themselves and thinks about him when they're with their man. Also every other man wants to be him and there's no convincing him otherwise. I'm describing a few people in one but they were so similar to each other it was uncanny. 

I am sorry to hear about this. I am sorry to hear when good people are mistreated by shallow people."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,lol they are even getting rid of radar. All they need is their 8 cams and those aren't even HD. Humans only have 2 cams. Of course its possible. Teslas are driving 100s of miles with 0 intervention right now.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"haha they call you because you are holding tesla shares? lmao. IB doesn't give a fuck and never calls me. 90% in Tesla and crispr, some of it on margin. Tesla is going to alpha centauri. Even if it doesn't reach 20k it WILL be at 10k in 10 years max. People here buy porsche because of some bs 30% arbitrage upside instead of buying tesla and crispr for infinte upside.

Tesla will be at 1m this year which is 100% growth with 100% more for next year. Lets see if the market has priced this in, even though consensus is way lower and most think 50% growth is very bullish.

nu-wsb has lost its way tbh."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. See you on the beach with your Tesla Roadster in 10 years time bro
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I know I’m buying one
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"A levitating roadster with space thrusters on the beach. Just imagine! 

Lets just hope tesla keeps selling cars at all by then. But I think the roadster is safe. The other cars will probably be only produced for robotaxi. This is why I have my cybertruck reservation. Its basically a free call option on FSD. If they double the price next year, I still have my FSD price locked in. Same if they stop selling cars altogether, they will probably still honor the reservations.

In a few years I will be driving around in my cybertruck, come back home and send the cybertruck to earn money at night. It will be awesome."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been in the liquor industry for about ten years now and the Tempus Fugit banana liqueur was honestly the first liqueur I had that was actually addictive. Most fruit liqueurs have a super artificial flavor to them with rough, astringent alcohol underneath (especially bottom-shelf stuff), or they're super light like most french style liqueurs. But this stuff... it's fucking dank. Imagine the flavor of super ripe bananas when they're mushy and spotty and almost black. Then imagine mixing half a cup of brown sugar into it.

Tempus Fugit usually does a pretty good job of making spirits. Some I've not been a fan of, like the fernet that tastes like toothpaste and dirt. But man, that banana stuff is liquid gold."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn that sounds great. That's always been my problem with any kind of flavored liqueur. Sounds like the kind of thing I could make all sorts of random delicious things with.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey u/AllDatDalton Great stuff as always! Thanks

i'm liking the VST play, and I may get some puts on PLUG for good measure.

I'm seeing a great setup here, with the recent great DD from u/NrdRage on $BE. Looking at the details, float is a relatively low 144M, with a price of $26, I'd imagine that inclusion in the index will rocket this stock. Also seems like a good long term hold for what its worth.  

Thoughts?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3mhkm/nrdrages\_friday\_dd\_spring\_is\_in\_the\_air\_the\_birds/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3mhkm/nrdrages_friday_dd_spring_is_in_the_air_the_birds/)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dalton you legend.

I’ve got your newsletter so I’ve been looking into this. I’m not a fan of puts (I’ve been hurt too many times) so I think the safer play is finding the new entries.

I assume the existing 30 stocks will remain in the index.
Therefore they will be adding another 50-70 stocks but the rebalance may take a month to play out.

There was some wording to say it will be based on market cap but they don’t necessarily have to be 100% green. 

Is the play to look at this sector and try and figure out what the next 50-70 stocks could be.

And then narrow that down to the ones with the lowest available float % as they will most likely spike the most? 
Then load up on calls, collect tendies and tell your boss to go fuck himeself."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah GEVO might be a great play here
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How could they have rebalanced already? If you look more deeply it appears that its been going back and forth as to if it was even going to happen. Later articles seem to insinuate it was uncertain if rebalancing was going to occur in february and i think even march it was still in question
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s the way I see it. For starters the pro-forma files came out on the 2-apr. I’m sure there will be some price movement based on that.

5.  Hit start.  
6.  Watch the brew come out until it turns from black espresso to looking like panther-piss (just a few seconds).  
7.  Hit the RED X for cancel.  
8.  Repeat steps 4-7 three or four times, five or six if you'd like cardiac arrest.  
9.  Take your brew  to the espresso machine and fill the remainder of your cup with Extreme Mocha espresso.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"A common narrative in markets is that with global rates so low, equities are the only game in town for investors with an appetite for upside. But after the worst selloff in Treasuries since 1980, the edge for stocks is starting to dull.

While yields are still low relative to history, the mantra of “there is no alternative” is losing its pull with 10-year Treasury rates nearly 80 basis points higher than they started in 2021.


As a result, the so-called Fed model -- which compares corporate profits to bond yields -- shows that S&P 500 Index stocks are the least attractive relative to Treasuries in more than a decade. 

The equity benchmark’s earnings yield  is about 1.3 percentage points above the yield on 10-year Treasuries. That’s the smallest advantage since 2010

Luckily, I’ve been DD’ing the fuck out of this stock, and can tell you that the timing of this article is more than troubling

MVIS is on a verge of a breakthrough announcement in not one, not two, but three different verticals:
1. LiDAR + EV cooperation with either MSFT/AAPL/or WVAGY
2. Giant, and I mean giant, patent moat that they are sitting on, as it’s gaining value, in billions (think Motorola being bought by Google for their patent moat)
3. The $22 billion dollar (just the initial leg of this contract, probably hundreds of billions when all said and done, once other branches and UN follows suit, like they’ve done in the past) with MSFT for the IVAS (augmented reality unmanned drone control goggles, or simply - remote digits vision goggles)

The last point happened just two days ago, and will be officially confirmed only next week, while the other 2 points are having announcements in Mid April.

So why a hit piece based on “historical averages”? Why now?

This is a 5x bagger if you play straight stocks, and possible breakout 500x bagger if you know what you are doing with debit call spreads.

Price now is $15
Price target is $75 (with buyout announcement possibly taking it to $150-$200)

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"read 1984. just like planned obsolescence - this is planned destruction of wealth.

tl;dr 1984:

poor has $100, rich has $1,000

war happens, missles are destroyed, ships are destroyed, planes are destroyed - global wealth is reduced by $99 dollars per person

poor has $1, rich has $901 (+the profit they made from insider trading on war)

before poor : rich was 1:10

not it's 1:901

1984, truly a great book. but instead of a big ass tv, it's your smartphone, and instead of 5 minutes of hate it's cnn"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You are absolutely delusional if you think BB will be $100 in the next 3 years.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they continue down the path they're headed, there's no reason why they shouldn't be. Whether analysts continue to undervalue them is one thing, but every big company is working towards the same goal, and all BB needs is partnerships with a few of them and that's huge $$$. Securing autonomous tech is something everyone will have to do, and furthermore, monetizing the data is where the money is. 

I'll mark my calendar, and I'll gladly eat my words if I'm wrong."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can totally see them at 30 dollars per year in the near future, but 100 seems crazy. A company that has been floundering for years isn’t going to all of a sudden gain 1000 percent.

That being said I still like their Cylance purchase and I think they are undervalued. Maybe I’m just nitpicking, I just hate the inflated expeditions ie: GME 100,000"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah,I hear you on the crazy expectations. That said, if GME hits 100k, I couldn't care less what happens to BlackBerry!! Haha

BB peaked in 2008 with a stock price in the $140s and revenue of about $6 billion. I think in 3 years, they'll get to somewhere around $2 billion but I think the data they'll have accumulated at that point will be worth multiples of that. It's such a weird age of valuations where companies like Amazon and Uber can show no profit, but be worth insane amounts because of their data."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Been holding since January. Was up huge but i'm selling on Monday. The just keep diluting the shares. 100M to 400M already. This shit will be worth $4 in a month fuck this
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The CEO basically gave himself a 100 percent raise during the pandemic.  I know basically for the long term survival they need to raise money to pay their debt. And if they go bankrupt the stock goes to zero.  But why is that the shareholder's problem?  Maybe renegotiate with lenders and landlords.   They(the people AMC owe money to) have money invested in them and will get peanuts if AMC goes under.  Shareholders can leave anytime.

Hey I have a 10 dollar stock(or whatever it is at the time) I'll vote to cut my value in half to 5. (Only if the board decides to issue the shares, they've shown such restraint before like not giving themselves raises.)
You have to be real stupid to vote to dilute and then hold.  How about sell the stock, then buy it for half price after the dilution if you're such a fan of the company.  They really need to just start a gofundme and end the charade, because that's what it basically is if you buy, vote to dilute, and then hold."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes we all know but it doesn’t change the fact that during the height of the apes trying to squeeze they were selling off like mad men and even gifting shares to family members to sell so they didn’t have to report it. These guys are just as bad as the hedgie IMO greedy pigs,  they don’t care if the boat sink as long as they can get there money before it does. Common sense tells me not to believe the shares won’t be diluted. Why would he tell any outsider that it will happen before it happens knowing that the apes will cause the stock to plummet before he can trade and barter the stock with his business associates. Ie landlords and vendors."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you understand they diluted their shares from 100 to 500 and plan to add 500 million to that? Share holders holding when only 100m shares were around will get diluted 90%! CEO just made retail bag holders.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you realize what your saying lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Better hold 1 share gme at 200+ that can go to 1k+ vs 20 shares of amc at 10 that will go to 0.

I don't like the shorts but I wouldn't feel bad if amc execs got fucked either. Honestly stubbs is a much harder sell with shorter release windows and some kind of disney, prime or similar subscription including theater viewings sounds kind of attractive for major premiers. If I go back in its because I think there is value waiting for them to be bought out by someone actually smart, not because I think it will pump back up. I know the dilution factor is huge and will wait for it. AMC is run by morons lucky that people just wanted to fuck over shorts."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"By literally doubling the number of shares, in addition to the dilution they've already done. They were losing money even before the pandemic, and have billions of dollars in debt. Had it not been for the first squeeze they would've already filed for bankruptcy by now. But even with that they're still in danger of going bankrupt in a year.


Yeah yeah, economy will reopen and all that. But here's the thing: the majority of their theaters are ALREADY open. I wouldn't expect a major surge in revenue when the pandemic ends, especially considering how studios are coming out with their own streaming platforms like Disney+ and Paramount+, completely bypassing the theaters in the process. 


Are theaters completely doomed? No, there's still demand for them. But there's no guarantee that AMC will survive just because other theaters will. Even if they do manage to avoid bankruptcy, they're gonna do it by issuing hundreds of millions of new shares, and that means buying it today would yield a terrible return on investment. It would need not just to survive, but to have incredible growth to have a chance at making money at these prices. 


So while I still think GME is insanely overvalued, AMC has far worse fundamentals IMO. I firmly believe it will nearly be a penny stock by the end of the year. <$2 is a very real possibility."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If you are 🤡 enought to hold amc through that go right ahead

However one point that you have discounted. There are millions of people like me that love going to the movies And are excited to watch good movies on the theaters. 

Godzilla’s results on Monday will tell the world if the movie buisness is relevant."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Time will tell. Not you. Vote will be completed May 4th, and it will be a “no” IMO from what’s been said in the AMC community. Even if it’s a “yes” that doesn’t mean the shares will be issued immediately. I’m betting that the business will not only survive, but thrive in the long term. That’s the cherry on top. The cake is the potential squeeze."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. I cannot believe the insane marketing/business model bashing from a community who began by backing a store that sells hard copies of games and t-shirts in a 15x30 room. “The movie experience is now in my living room”. By that logic the entire GameStop experience has been on Amazon, Console marketplaces, and every other large retailer for years? 
Yeah, bUt GaMeStOp Is GoInG DiGiTaL and EcoMmErCe. What?? Like every retailer has been doing for literal decades now? Until very recently Theaters were the only source of new releases, same day. Revenue streams from movie sells and concessions really can’t match or exceed the purchases of a couple Nintendo switches and Zelda shirts per month? Cmon, these are both aging, ultimately failing, businesses that we want to see prosper (squeeze). 
Christ sake, these stocks follow the exact same trend and the communities shit on each other. What happened to, “we’re all apes after our bananas”? We all want our tendies etc? 

This is not the way."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most people in WSB missed the VWAGY squeeze just this march...

talk about the og infinity squeeze."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"you should be nervous selling options without knowing options greeks, yes. you're pretty close to going in blind if you're selling without having a basic idea, and this has the potential to burn you.

theta on a option is time decay. basically all else being equal, over time, a contract will be worth less because there's less time for it to go in the money. (charm is basically how fast theta changes)

vega is sensitivity to implied volatility. if implied volatility goes down, the price of an option will go down, because high implied volatility implies large swings in the price of the stock, whereas low implied volatility implies small swings in the price of the stock.

--

normally for most stocks, IV goes up when the price drops down. but for GME, it's the other way around.

you as an option seller, want the price of an option to go down (preferably to 0), so because of the sensitivity to IV, selling puts at a strike price of something like $50 is often very profitable."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,They're taking time since there are so many people.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"We read the “dd”, it’s good for a laugh."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I guess I've been more or less ""wheeling"". I sell puts at a strike slightly below for sweet premium, then sell covered calls when I get assigned for slightly above. 300 shares total, wheel with 200 to keep 100 free just in case the cult is right... am I stupid?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Calling an ideology gobbledy-gurk is just baiting some one into a political response by insulting some one's political stance.

Again, not all stances are valid. World is round, yadda yadda. I don't care if that rustles your jimmies.

What did actually bother me is I had to say ""gurk"" instead of the real word because apparently that's a slur now?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"First of all, talk for yourself. Secondly, wtf is so funny about reading how fucking corrupt is the market and the world overall. People are scared of things they don’t understand, so they tend to mock it to feel better about themselves. Respectfully, go eat a dick"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wheeling is a decent strategy but the thing to watch out for is if GME craters too far and doesn't recover, you could be eating a loss if you haven't made up your cost basis.

Be on the lookout for if GameStop decides to issue shares imo as that's probably the one thing that can stop this madness."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Saying some one else's point of view isn't valid or insulting is asking for an argument that would be political in nature. No reason to bring that shit up. To be fair though, any talk of some sort of ""movement"" should have been removed from this sub from the beginning as it's basically political bullshit."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, what’s funny is how the DD that you guys say is so amazing makes no goddamn sense. And the reason it’s funny is because when people try to explain to you cultists why the DD is wrong or why GME is not a “sure thing” you just get pissy and whiny. Like you did just here. So it’s impossible to feel bad for you. If you want to stop being mad and start making money, do some real fucking research instead of constantly relying on confirmation bias. Good luck!"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd say the play is buy in and then sell calls. You'll be even in less then a year. Risk pretty well mitigated. 

Mind you I'm a meat popsicle not a financial advisor so YMMV."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the company’s future is entirely dependent on Dragonfly sales after the pandemic. That’s an unknown so it literally can’t be priced in.

I would of went with nio 40c and hit the same numbers but I was out of funds. Literally my last $380 in my account. I needed a solid win to start this bullish month.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Working class here too. We are not double taxed.

If you make $75k you're taxed on it, let's say your net is $55k. You invest $10k into a stock. The value goes to $15k, you're not taxed. The value goes to $7.5k, you're still not taxed. Now say it returns to $10k and you need the cash for some family emergency and sell, withdraw the cash, use it. You are still not taxed.

Now say that $10k hits the meme stock lotto and is now worth $150k, you withdraw it. You're taxed on the income you earned in trading, consider this like a second, part-time job, a side-hustle. You're only taxed on the $140k gains, not the $10k you originally invested that you were already taxed on. Now you've earned $215k for the year and will be taxed accordingly.

Some people quit their job to take up trading. Should they be tax free?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. 

If the principle they are starting with was already taxed. 

It penalizes investment and it’s a hinderance on moving capital to new investments."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's added income. Doesn't penalize investments. If you have $3k to invest and you lose all $3k, you get a $3k deduction. If you gain $3k and sell, withdraw funds, you get your original $3k back completely untaxed, and the new money that has never been taxed now gets taxed.

Point is, there was no double taxation, anywhere."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,👋 Hello
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like he fled to OGs with HELLBOY - didnt comment a lot but does have high scores for his comments in these threads
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,She’s shadowbanned?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,We were having our sub wars and then made fizzy pre photo so it makes sense tbh
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You did. And no one calls me mom here anymore now. Lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, which means rich is still my main simp"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t it be hilarious if u/fannypackphantom was some kid using his moms photos.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Face reveal was a week ago and I didn’t even remember you being here for that. Pretty impressive mod bracket pandering considering this is a lot of time
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ive been pity simping
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys also saw a weird photo, idk - I realize there’s a lot floating, but the eagle one doesn’t really look exactly like me."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately I can’t help the situation because I’m also an asshole and I’d do the same. I’d be a dick teacher.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s fine. I had goals recently. Plus everyone but me wipes comments
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you like those, you’d probably like Vinland Saga and Made in Abyss. Mushoku Tensei is also pretty good, the first season just aired, I liked it better than AoT s4 🤡"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Code Geass, Monster, Made in Abyss, and Steins; Gate are good mystery shows. If you liked OPM, you’ve got to watch Mob Psycho 100, made by the same guy but it’s better"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Never heard of it 😏
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Also Hulu’s animaniacs 2020

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Also we should look at mod simps and I already know it’s me especially with comment deletes but that would be funny too
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/VacationLover1 is definitely a higher simp level but he says Carrie to avoid algos 🙄

It’s like the Icelandic and emoji hack for small caps"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t know you were a lesbian? Lol. 

I try not to post in the unpinned because people will check my profile from the daily and find your safe haven in the unpinned through my comment history 😔"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sus
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Better to not smile probably ^(or show your thumb, you know the one) shit did we not start yet?"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This video was a trip 😂😂😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,“Fuck off and die” lmaooooo😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m ambidextrous. Like born that way kind
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I was left handed for a week because I wanted attention from the teacher and wanted to feel special. Notebook rings suck
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a sneaking suspicion you have paid for one of his pencils
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re a 5 to me 🥺
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You gotta yolo on some FDs and upgrade that ride

I am biased though because I think gravel bikes are whack"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit you had me excited, still really cool though!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That would be pleasurable tho.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is some of the most stressful shit 😣 CEO came to visit a couple years back and had never been more nervous
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha I was just saying that to troll Rich but good to know
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How many upvotes!?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait hold up. I commented in unpinned less than marsinfurs and cutiesarus?!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I have stuff at my place but have to leave the house to get motivated. I’ll be happy to berate you to motivate you like you did me 😬
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes plz
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep! As long as you can stick to it. It doesn’t matter. I think at the time I really needed something to focus on so that’s why it worked for me.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Liar! My nipples are way better 😤
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't ask him to take a pic with a banana. He'll definitely get the wrong idea
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Give me the name. I’ll get to the bottom of this
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,#YES WE DO - ME
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I gotta see this
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I gotta seee
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you fucking serious!? You mean I didn’t have to have r/jelqing in my active subs when that aapl day trader jelqer posted months ago 😳
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Most normal city in America 😎
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I never wanted to be a tease and if I was #1 it would have hurt you more 💁‍♀️ plus i tag you in comments as a stand-alone way more so the data is flawed anyway
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve never replied to you in my life either.  In fact, who are you?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s just cuz I nuked my comments. I was your number one simp promise
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I only simp for ~~soxl~~ best bun
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,ya i got you bun
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I’m thinking because I  make new comments all the time instead of commenting to him and say “rich” because I know he’ll see it and it’ll be like I’m talking about him not to him

So I’m saying maybe i simp more but I forget where I was placed"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That was the first one I clicked obviously
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"hell yeah dude! keep at it!

yeah just stopped for some food, back on the road again soon 🏃💨"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You some sort of pencil artist or something
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"NO

I dont need more confusion in my life.  It's hard enough to know you are straight and to still read the shit you post"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If you own blackwing 602s I would be impressed
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,oof
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Mime are quality and quantitu
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine posting in OGs 😳😳😳
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk why I can’t remember him. I recognize most everyone else except for a few on this list.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"We lost a lot on the list to them. 

Stupid fucks."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk. Coulda said the name of fuck boi wish is a nickname for rich since it’s banned from wsb
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,We are like the two guys in stepbrothers with sub wars and then our own sub as like the final cut scene
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh heyyy step mom 😳
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,its hard to call you business mom when you're hot af and not much older than me
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,LOOK AT THE SECOND CHART
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You just fucking love this don’t you 😭
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It could be true. u/GoBeaversOSU knows pictures can be lies.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I took a Polaroid selfie of myself the other day and I looked like a serial killer, I know what you mean"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"In that case, I'm sure /u/Darkbyte would appreciate more sample data to get a better mental picture.

Purely for better dream visualization, of course.

👀🔎"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Now you’re my unpinned nemesis
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude season 4 was pretty tight but it sucked to wait each week. Steins;gate is definitely my favorite tho. Too too ruu 😢
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wrote these down, I'm gonna see which one I like and watch one of these, thanks 😎"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn I didn't even see that, gonna add that to my list too 👌"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh shittt I know this show!!! I'm gonna binge this right now
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It is 😭
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I found the post ;) I am winner
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,posted
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,these are only direct replies to your comments not mentions
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not a lesbian 😂

this is just when I doxxed with photos from a bet and u/Darkbyte declared I’m a lesbian. Measuring comments from that day. I don’t remember if you were even in here. 

And that’s cool of you guys to avoid, but it doesn’t matter. Unpinned has a bracket in pinned and people watch us talk. It’s weird, but it’s a legit thing we just found out about and now pinned people know my real name ☹️"

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL. Respect. Notebook rings, desks, scissors, high end pencils, high end pens - it’s all bullshit for lefties"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I have looked but I’m pretty stingy and I’m no simp
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"are you from tennessee? because you’re the only TEN I SEE.... 

wait...doesn’t apply in this scenario"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You read my mind! I actually want to get into year round biking and so wanted to get the fat bike Trek Farley 5. The problem is i need atleast 2500 dollars for it. 1700 for the bike and the rest for the car hitch and rack .... TSLA needs to ride again for this to happen :)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,1442
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the day 1 and 2 did you in I think, they finished uploading in-between queries"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds good. I like resisting ppl
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now get up off your lazy ass and get yourself to the top of those stats (yes, all of them)"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s true it’s just we both know he’s gonna have a tough road ahead with girls and stuff and I wanted to boost his confidence
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shhhh there is definitely no bracket, none at all, nothing to see here 🤫🤭"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,But what if it's actually... me?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you find it, let me know!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s in his head and I’m negative points because I worked for an hour today

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,carrie pls know I am only joking with you I know you are straight and forever not an option lol.  but you are a hot lesbian 💯% 10/10
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,who is this?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn reverse psychology 😤
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I plan to bro. My goal is completely shredded by the summer or at least when I go back to the office in October. How many hours total you gotta drive?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I like a good pencil to write with and I use graph paper.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I get squeamish if a girl tries to kiss me but will move in with a boy if he teases me.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Lol, I own blackwing 602s"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I can tell 🤭
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Sour taste in my mouth over some of them for sure.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I knew it was going away. Kinda miss Kmart Janet Yellen tbh.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao. Reminds me of the kid from Seinfeld who mails Elaine the Play button off their VCR
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I look hot as fuck in the mirror than taking a selfie reminds me I’m ugly as fuck.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m probably going to have to post one of these kinds so it chills out. I tried that with Darkbyte and it didn’t work, but it’ll work for dudes."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I gave her no makeup shitty pics and it didn’t help u/Darkbyte
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Great. I need one
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I don’t know if I can wait for the next season 😞You’ve already seen the best shows, so it’s all down hill from here lol"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Start with Mob Psycho 😉
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Cheers!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ohhh ok. this is so much fun. I really love stats. Lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"> now pinned people know my real name ☹️

My real name is Jessica.

Now people know mine too so you aren't the only one"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,FYI DarkByte sent me the link 😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know carrie is not a real lesbian i saw the photo before I knew it was her and she looks 

# 🌈GAY AF🌈"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whoa whoa whoa. 

Unpinned has a bracket in pinned!?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I definitely would have remembered that 😂

I don't think it helps tho"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO your responses 💀
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No matter the pic, I already have mine locked and loaded 😬"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Pens and markers leaving the smug mark sucks so much.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Being a simp is understandable when its the pencil sharpening god himself
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,How’d you know? 🤭
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes sir!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Who’s the top bro? I need to know
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That I would accept. But others 🙅‍♂️
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol not really because I didn’t comment there but I always like making those jokes
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol I know, and also not one guy here has a chance anyway 💅"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,👍 good job
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"nice man. i also lost a lot of weight from covid, shit was awful. i’m back to my pre-pandemic weight now that the gyms are open 

i’ve got three more hours. ready to get to my place and face the feds that u/timforbroke called on me."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Weirdo. I was hoping you’d say you were drew with them bc I woulda hit you with the draw me like one of your French girls line or whatev the quote is from the titanic
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,what if a butch lady tried to kiss you
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I never thought I would talk to another person that knew what those were lmaoo.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfaoo
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I get weirdly bitter with that one.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it makes you feel any better, in my mind's eye you'll always be a ringer for Janet Yellen."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"😂 omg, I forgot about that episode"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,u/darkbyte sees the truth 🥵
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty sure that means you're just a hot lesbian then.

/u/Darkbyte is a black box hot-lesbian-detector learning machine with a lifetime of training data to build a model. If she thinks you're a hot lesbian, you must be a hot lesbian ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

May as well just go ahead and break the news to your husband!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m watching hunter x hunter but only half paying attention
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that ones description sounds like the one I'll like the most 👌
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,same this is why i dreamed of us last night lmao
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If was on your march madness bracket lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t know if u/Darkbyte saved it but she’s your best shot
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Now I'm curious 😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently but it could be a joke and only in individual heads. Like they see it and rank someone in their minds only. I didn’t ask questions but we got a guy in here now that seems to confirm this place is known
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,So. Much.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s true. I do hope someone will buy it for me for Christmas. I get weird gifts and I’m hoping
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[whupshhhh](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/NJ71L7u)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well usually it's me, but I'm open to new ideas"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I was gonna say either way hilarious
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh shit Timmy snitched bro? That’s no good lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s for another comment days goal
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If I can’t squint so she looks like Angelina Jolie I won’t even try
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks 🥲
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Ok help me out- how many photos have you seen?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You missed the other night then. I tried having a girlfriend in high school and I couldn’t deal.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never seen it, too long for me 🤡"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The animation is amazing 🤯
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol yeah I know but idk who saw that
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh she did ! 😂
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,posted a link up there 👀
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s up with your nose? I didn’t notice anything. You want to hear mine now or wait?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You know they're gonna go through your comment history and see this right? Now you've shown weakness!
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s a great idea we should have an unpinned secret Santa.....Actually on second thought giving you guys my shipping address might not be the best move
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"#🥵

Yes plzzzz"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,#🥵
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"found out i was laundering money for the Navarro Cartel SMH

i gotta get back on the road now but i’ll see you later big man ✌️🏃"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,oh so you like femmes more?? 🥺
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I have personally only seen the gif with the bird landing on you and the one with you looking at the eagle. So only two. Maybe you can delete them off imgur?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Darkbyte model is never wrong!


Just kidding though. Sorry if this is all is starting to make you uncomfortable, I can stop if it's not funny anymore."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s so weird how many stalkers were got but I guess ppl are just bored. Lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,See ya bro
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It would just have to be a femme to even think about it and have to be like or be Angelina Jolie. Besides that most guys would have a better shot
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah the one of me looking at the bird is the problem photo. It’s not accurate. I didn’t even think people would notice it was me from the other gif
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol you’re fine. I doxxed myself just to keep the comments going and it’s all for fun.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I looked at my profile traffic stats yesterday, 😬"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmm idk that’s hard. You could say a mini roast about you in the title I guess
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s actually the retardation that doesn’t allow me to wipe, either way."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I'm sure they're terrified with their purchased market %."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,!remind me 1 year

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Big bull testicles for the hedgies
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That's how I like the bull best
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This getting stupid and not surprising. You must have some rich parents or some bullshit to go around like this.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Not quite.... white collar worker who got in on GME in October after reading all the DD and taking a risk with the $10K in this account. I wish I had waited until now to BUY these $800 calls or July $800 calls as IV has collapsed tremendously in the last 3 weeks.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I completely agree.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"!remind me 12 days when this big man comes through ITM on all his 800c’s

You got this. 💎👐"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Banger song hope the position works out or u sell it
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"also depends where you live. I recently cleared 100 for the first time. I'm def not poor anymore but I'm also far from rich.

Well,  my GME profits might also have tipped me in that direction but I immediately invested that in regular market shit so it doesn't really feel any different."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I am increasingly impressed with people's knowledge of my eclectic references.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I like to eat paint chips myself.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't.  I'm just saying, if everyone who had calls exercised them, that would likely cause the squeeze.  I never said it was likely, I never said that those people have the money to exercise them, I never said that it was a good idea for anyone to do so.  I just said that *if all the calls were exercised at once, it would absolutely trigger the squeeze.*  

Don't read too much into it bud."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Could you crush that up and snort it?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,">They are projected to earn about $7.50 this year and over $8 next year which at the current price 

per share?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,">Hopefully most of you are getting your vaccine

Stopped reading right there. We joke about being retarded here.. not actually being retarded."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly why I will never invest in this company. I don't believe in the company and secondly, they treat their employees like shit. Investing in them is an awful idea"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't like Robinhood but suing over a meme tier newsletter makes Ice Cube look like a douche idc who he is suing. It was a damn pun Jesus you thin skinned dbag
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I got some last words..."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"...."" Fuck all yall"""
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"No need to sell, it's great to always see that bit of green optimism there, 99% profit.     Expecting a dip on GME?"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It's been pretty stable lately around 190... Plenty of upside. But also plenty of downside. If going really heavy in GME a defensive put is a good idea just to cover your ass.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Just remind him after bo
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold tendies are coming be patient
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I am from country of God ..... I bet u come from hell .....

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,When did you sell? While it near 690 before the tank on Thursday?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,100@12.71
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone is being scammed by their insurance companies lol. It is what it is.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit. At this rate, this DD is going to convince me to max out all my credit card at 25% APR and still be able to profit more than 130% of the original cost? Fuck yah. I'm Jacked to the tits."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Good DD.  Prayers for your daughter.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,\^this will be our new ape saving charity funds
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll fucking do it again
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,FYI warrants are better when stock is under 18 instead of calls. $4.5 warrant is a 11.5 call leap.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,400 shares and 1100 warrants here
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Hilarious cause it’s not a spac anymore. Not that I disagree with you.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just want to add another thing.
I really think that BB will boom in the next couple of years why the reason is because they have partnered up with 23 out of 25 OEM cars this exclude any oems mainly from China. So here's the thing, think about it if Chinese owned EV vehicles start partnering up with BB there are over 400 registered vehicles manufacturers in China this means that it's going to be a big boom for BB to acquire some stake in their business. Plus BB already partnered with Baidu. this is my 2 cent. BB to the moon!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"nicely put, when other contracts end, BB will win when other cybersecurity companies clients are compromised. It's not matter if but when."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"nobody really knows the timing otherwise we all get rich quick. Buying stock is alot to do with market sentiments, sometimes work with fundamental when all is settled, but when volatility kicks in that's when sentiments come in to play as well. The question is are you up for it? it's both you know and I know, but it all will end up in your hand, profit or not. My 2 cent."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You forgot this at the end. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Def feel better about my 90 shares a $12 each
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"i also got in nok when it was high, not as high as yours because i was late into the game, anyway still a hodler."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"i also got in nok when it was high, not as high as yours because i was late into the game, anyway still a hodler."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont think $300 will take away many hands.. people are stuck higher than that
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The concern is when GameStop sells a ton of shares, the price will take a steep and fast nosedive, likely we’ll under $100.  Normally, that alone wouldn’t scare most, but it will take “much” longer to go back up and the volatility will be much less than it is now.  I suspect that it wouldn’t reach $150 again for at least a couple of years if ever.

Again, this is all speculative, and hopefully I am wrong, but it is a possibility."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow! A rare FUBO DD post! And that too with so many awards!? Get in there boys! Let’s take this to the moon 🌙 🚀 

I teared up while reading this 🥲"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Curious about how you find the product.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,In with you with my 1500 at 45 lmao.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve had Sling, Hulu live, etc. It’s good for live sports and streaming cable. It’s UI is nicer than sling. It gets local channels too, which is nice since most bug games come on local network affiliates. 

I think they will struggle with their price point at $65/month. Long term for the stock- who knows right? Any number of companies could start streaming cable. That’s not proprietary. I’m holding a very small amount."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t legally trade American weed companies until federal legalizes from my understanding.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You can trade the MSOs on the CSE (Cad) and OTC (USA) markets. You can also buy an index fund of American companies on the NYSE with the $MSOS ticker
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure how multi state operations or MSO’s work. From what I read you have to buy them over the counter. How does one do that?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,If you live in the states you’ll need to find a trading platform that allows you to buy OTC stocks. Robinhood doesn’t allow it and I think a few others like Webull may not also.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"The #2, #3, and #4 have nothing to do with Aphria either. I’d actually wager a bet the Safe act will do more harm for shareholders than anything. If MSO uplisting happens a mass exodus of capital is expected from the LPs on big boards to where the actual opportunity lies (US license holders). Make no mistake, the momentum we are seeing this year is disproportionately about the USA vs anything else.

Also: many expect a massive sell the news event when the merger actually happens. The most easily priced in thing for publicly traded companies.

And no I don’t short companies."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I use E*TRADE. But I’m not even sure how to buy over the counter. I’m down for that.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Got it. Again. Thanks for setting me straight. Let’s move on.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"If e trade allows OTC trading, just search the companies you’re interested in and it’s like anything else."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I was in a stupid mood due to bad family crap going on which apparently is serious but I can't be told about and i threw out stupid crap online in response so I apologise. Ape no fight ape. I do actually want to expand my knowledge and US cannabis stocks get a lot of attention but there is so much back and forth on it being a great opportunity then people saying it's a meme stock and loss porn all over. I'm literally the only person I know trying to get in at this sort of level and have mine and my children's investments to deal with. Mostly I have vanguard funds for the majority since its reasonable returns and safe but I've a fair bit for more risky investments. 

Basically MSOS etf is worth looking into? My knowledge of that market consists of buying Legendary OG to help reduce my insane opiate intake for chronic back pain. Also starting a new qualification that should double my income but takes up a lot of time, trying to clear and remodel the house and prepare two teenagers for leaving home if they can ever find accommodation since we live in  a tourist destination and the G7 is coming too, which I also have to work on. Sorry for my previous comments."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll put 50 bucks on it. U down?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,No no I NEED May to be good.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"sounds like credit suisse is still bag holding some VIAC on leverage they need to de-lever, but most banks have already exited enough to where they are comfortable holding it. Watch for a fade to $40 ish and that could be a great long entry for 3+ month calls. Took a week to crash, so probably going to take 1-3 months to recover to $75 ish."

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Or a lot of people will lose a lot of money.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Lived in San Diego for 10 years using Bovada. Moved back to Indiana and been on DraftKings ever since. Love the app and sportsbook compared to the rest. Future bets are insane on there..
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It's happening its happening its happening
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Why’d you sell?
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Saw weakness in the charts
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,You wrote saying ocgn isn’t at phase 3 yet but it was back early March
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"I messaged you , would love to chat"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,1600 at avg of 6.19 😏
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Well now that BB earnings are fucked up the charm is gone. I have been trying to sell the calls at bid price and still not going anywhere. We are officially bag holders of BB now. :'(
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,When does this 19$ start???
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because of your posts with OTM calls, I decided to buy ITM call options. It doesn't mean that it will stay as ITM with RKT lol. But this stock fluctuates by a few dollars within a week so it it's worth it. $22.5 call 4/23. Hoping to sell around $25 to make some bucks."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, yeah, options are tricky with this stock. I personally think you'll be alright, I think the market didn't know how to react to the news that Dan Gilbert sold off a chunk of stock, but I think it will go up when people realize it's a good thing, but there's also the issue of people selling out now thinking it'll be harder to squeeze. Who knows. Good Luck though!"
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"> but the fundamentals and general consensus is the same. 

&#x200B;

> Lol fundamentals don’t matter this is a casino dude.  

Are you just retarded, or retarded?

You are missing my point. This is not a scenario where the stock will go back to its ATH because the stock was already artificially inflated in the first place. There are other tickers affected by this that have much more opportunity. Play the casino intelligently to win, retard."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,not surprising at all. great dd.  how about $viac doing an offering just b4 the sell off ..well timed Id say. VIAC owns part of fubo which I own & we got crushed as a side affect. once again across the board who holds the real bag? us.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Bill Hwang belongs to here.

04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the big takeaway from the thread. Imagine being offered millions of shares privately and knowing the impact that will have when you and the couple dozen other people like you decide to pass on a private transaction.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Where are the articles at for the 14 million revenue in single day sales prior to this weekend for Godzilla vs kong? ARTICLES????
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"And Otter,... who sold meat and weed."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,*looks* Your astrophotos are great! You might want to try sticking to that instead. LOL
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,But gambling so much fun....
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I am sure there must be a way to combine your hobbies. *something something to the moon*
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,The majority of stock exchanges are private.
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,It's about to pop
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,That's like 500% growth bruh
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea haha it doesn’t technically start until April 2nd as mentioned in the OP. I actually picked up 5 more $65p at 0.25
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, here we are 1 week after. The stock didn't move much and I still think it's going to tank back to where it was before and probably under because the dilution due to the new shares but it still didn't happened so wait and see. For sure we can forget about a new squeeze,  I'm one of the few long time short all the other ones are day traders."
04/03/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought the cybertruck was a joke.
