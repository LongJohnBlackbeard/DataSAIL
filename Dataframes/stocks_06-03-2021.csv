2021-06-03 19:37:48,stocks,"They're great through a recession. Sectors boom and bust, but even in the worst times, people make sure they have money to keep the lights on.

You won't see wild growth with them, but most pay a healthy dividend and it's a position you can count on over the long run."
2021-06-03 19:53:19,stocks,I like ED and VZ best - I count Verizon as utility but maybe others don’t meh.
2021-06-03 19:43:14,stocks,"Utilities tend to have longer term contracts.  They can provide stability, which allows a larger dividend payout ratio to be safe.  This means a larger dividend yield.  They are a defensive play, good for income.  They also tend to have lower capital appreciation."
2021-06-03 19:41:14,stocks,"In oversimplified terms, the expenses are reflected in the unit price. You won't see a fee, but the price per unit would be 1% less than the exact same ETF with a 0% ER."
2021-06-03 19:15:39,stocks,The volume you would need to buy to make this worth while is out of reach for the average investor.
2021-06-03 19:25:36,stocks,"I think Amazon is a strong buy right now, and will offer more returns over a 1-5yr period than VTI or any of those other companies. It's been consolidating in a relatively tight range for about 10 months, which is a relatively short time in mega-cap stock timeframes.

Wanting to have more cash is a real issue to consider. But if this is a long term account then you couldn't really put your cash in an investment which offers a better combination of safety and growth prospects."
2021-06-03 19:03:05,stocks,Look into QQQ.
2021-06-03 19:02:35,stocks,Rather buy $MSFT.
2021-06-03 19:24:17,stocks,Amzn is going to plummet
2021-06-03 19:10:43,stocks,Doesnt have Amazon in it but look into QQQJ or QQQN both are beating VTI
2021-06-03 19:29:30,stocks,"In terms of the time line ... ""is it worth pulling thr trigger now?""

I am just guessing here, but I think that once the infrastructure bill is signed, SPY will go past 425, large caps keep melting up, and Amazon has a good chance to finally break out.  But who knows. From a technical perspective, the 50 week average is coming up to it literally this week.  That could start to push it.  

I'm not going to tell you that it's going to start moving next month, or next year, no one knows. But as you point out, the PE screams ""buy"" and good gains come to those who are patient.  In 3 years, people will wish for a $3200 share."
2021-06-03 19:04:26,stocks,"Interestingly enough, VTI has outperformed QQQ so far in 2021."
2021-06-03 19:11:26,stocks,Can’t get any thing like that for my ISA

2021-06-03 18:56:23,stocks,"Probably wasting your time tbh. But at least it makes me feel better and confidently hold through tough times to know the real value of the company.

2021-06-03 19:19:29,stocks,I’m physically and mentally exhausted and know so many people feeling the same way. Once this AMC run is over I’m taking a 2 month break. Enjoy the summer

2021-06-03 18:41:09,stocks,"I love this post because there’s some reality attached to it. I feel it’s important to only put money at play when you have a play to make. I have probably 35-40 of my cash deployed in the market in long plays that have all been vetted, parameters set for sell/buy alerts for catalysts set etc. that said I’m always doing my homework, I learned that if I’m deploying cash just to not miss out, I adopt an almost cancerous mindset. You’ll make more money on 20-30% of your cash making educated plays than you would half assing all your money. Happy trading"

2021-06-03 19:45:42,stocks,"I must be insane because I look at the ticker everyday, just to see if the squeeze started.

OP is right, but not for the reasons he/she thinks.

The market has two players, institutions and retail.

Retail’s mistake is believing everything they’re told, even when it’s coming from the institutional side.

Just bought shares?

Congrats the broker works for the institutions, and they have sold your order flow to the opposing party.

Watched the news?

Congrats, they are also owned by institutions, which dictate who can talk about what, in order to make sure you remain ignorant and naive.

Read through social media for public sentiment?

Many influencers from YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit have been approached by “marketing firms” looking to hire them as shills.

As long as retail investors doesn’t realize how conflict of interest is affecting them, 80% of them will always be on the losing side of their bet/investment."
2021-06-03 19:53:06,stocks,I agree with you but in order to catch these huge moves you gotta be monitoring in some fashion daily or just be okay missing out on them.
2021-06-03 19:55:56,stocks,But you won’t be able to buy the dip if you just delete your broker app and aren’t watching your stocks😆
2021-06-03 18:37:46,stocks,Some people get too greedy and don’t know when to quit. I’m up around £300 (started with about £200) and I make sure to sell when it starts dropping

2021-06-03 19:35:47,stocks,i went off on my homie for mentioning AMC BB and GME im pretty much over hearing it from people who dont regularly make trades talking about all this squeeze here and there bullshit. Once the euphoria wears off well what price point the companies end up at but until them im out. Im buying nothing But MO TSLA MSFT and AMD for the rest of the year and im shutting down. Sorry if i come off as an asshole i went on a hell of a tangent.
2021-06-03 18:51:29,stocks,you're up 50% and telling me about how others get too greedy?
2021-06-03 19:50:42,stocks,The market does not create money... or maybe you just didn't understand what he said

2021-06-03 19:01:40,stocks,If I hear the word ape one more time!
2021-06-03 19:43:21,stocks,"Not coming off as an A\*\*hole at all. To each their own. For me personally, I've sifted through hours and hours of DD on some of these 'meme' stocks enough for me to comfortably hold for the past couple months. My gains have been about 100% just in GME but I was burned by other tech stocks when I was a rookie (now Rookie Sr.) before. 

What I regret doing before GME was not investing in the long term plays you've mentioned, and looked solely for speculative plays that would net double digit % yeilds within a week. I wanted money fast but the motto I hear now is ""the stock market is a tool of transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient"". I've basically donated so much money from my impatience, and talked to a lot of patient investors who've netted more than 30% returns in some of these long term plays, especially TSLA.

Don't ever feel bad for expressing your opinion because someone in this subreddit will learn a lot from a different perspective!"
2021-06-03 19:19:02,stocks,Also it’s over 100% not 50. Great maths 👍🏻

2021-06-03 18:49:14,stocks,"My take on the skyrocketing prices is: 

1. COVID has made a lot of city dwellers want to move to the suburbs 
2. There are a limited amount of homes available, so demand for wood has increased considerably 
3. Production of wood hasn’t kept up with newfound demand 

And/Or 
1. There aren’t enough transporters to move lumber around the country as post-COVID employment levels are still getting back to pre-pandemic levels 

But I’m just a guy with thumbs so all of this could be wrong and I’m just as confused as you are OP"

Do you think one reason for them to be able to hike prices so much might be increased demand with a resulting bidding war due to a inflationary scenario (remember how much money the fed printed in 2020?).

2021-06-03 18:06:41,stocks,That's actually what stirred my friend to look into it. You'd think short supply would mean the difference in price going to pay for labor to get more wood. But seeing how profit margin for mills are up massively clearly debunks that. The profit is going to these mills.

2021-06-03 19:35:18,stocks,Lumber is up but timber is not. It's not entirely inflation related.
2021-06-03 19:55:33,stocks,"It's not inflation, it's an opportunity. For this example it's lumber, lumber mills have lived on razor thin margins since 2008. Most paper companies got out of the lumber game because of it. Covid has presented a way to throw open margins while blaming it on external factors. Why wouldn't the entire sector follow this? 

I think when the moratorium on evictions lifts you are going to see a complete fallout of the housing and the suppliers for that market. Right now the entire housing market is being driven by low interest rates and low supply.  When people start getting foreclosed on, you're going to see a HUGE spike in supply. I would venture to say it's going to be like 2008/2009 all over again in the housing market."
2021-06-03 19:22:01,stocks,"Yeah, this is what I was thinking too. Loss of production coupled with unchanged or increased demand means the price of lumber is going to go up. Same with lots of stuff where the production of the given material wasn't deemed ""essential"" or could only produce at reduced capacity and the demand of the material didn't go down accordingly.

Like we're seeing gas prices start to go up now. During COVID gas consumption was ***way*** down so there wasn't an immediate effect, but now that more people are returning to the office... Gas is going up because production had been down for a while."
2021-06-03 19:40:27,stocks,"I’m in transportation, we never got shut down either we were essential since day 1. The lumber yards weren’t essential for awhile supposedly so they hadn’t been operating the whole year last year. Not sure how much I believe that though, I’ve been across the country probably 40 times since 2019 (literally across the entire country along i40/i20/i10) and the lumber yards I pass along the way were always operational.

2021-06-03 18:09:55,stocks,But that clearly isn't true. Because lumber is still being consumed and inventories aren't changing. Meaning that their inventories can keep up with demand. There isn't a supply shortage. The price is mainly to do with mills increasing their prices and blaming it on covid.

But that only showed up once. If what you're saying is true then I could see it be a situation where they dumped their supply in hopes of saying ""see we can't stop logging because we don't have enough for demand!"""
2021-06-03 19:22:04,stocks,"It is because these large commodity suppliers can’t just ramp up production. It is not like you can buy a whole lumber mill from Walmart. The mills got disrupted during covid either via supply line issues and or having the mills run at lower capacity than normal. It is not like they can make up for that downtime easily past peek load. People still need lumber, so there is a shortage causing prices to rise. As far the tree farms or the people cutting it down they aren’t the bottle neck, the milling companies are... so the choppers and the farms can’t exert any extra pricing power in the market."

It's not first-time buyers, or even single families... they're buying up all the properties because they think we won't be able to afford them, so we'll *rent* the properties from them. Inflation is the only thing that trickles down.

This isn't free-market capitalism, it's bullshit.

In IBKR, if you want to buy an asset in other currency, for example in your case, first time IBKR will automatically convert CAD to USD and buy the asset, but when you sell it, it will retain the USD cash recieved in the account, which can be reused for next buying in USD.

If the 'Use base currency' is not selected, the account will show cash in two currencies. 

If selected, I believe it will do a mark to market conversion of the USD to show you CAD equivalent entries and these entries you mention seem to be because of that mark to market conversion at end of the day for reporting."

when I buy on my leverage itll show as -6k usd my cad value will never be converted on my screen it will always show a - USD value 


oo okay that ending im trying to understand a bit  the mark to market will show a cad equivalent of my entries which is why it shows forex and a - or + value for the day

2021-06-03 15:42:40,stocks,"Hedging is basically buying insurance against a particular adverse event. For example, if you wanted to hedge against the S&P being down more than x%, you could buy put options that pay off when the index is down by more than that amount, cushioning your portfolio against further losses. Those options will cost you money, and they will expire worthless when the index goes up, so you would have to keep buying new ones if you want to continue carrying that insurance. This would weigh on your return in the long run, but could make you sleep better. It would probably be more economical to simply decrease your portfolio size if you're uncomfortable with the risk you're taking."

If you're constantly holding a buffer against those types of events, it'll just slowly bleed your gains over time.

There are a bunch of inverse ETFs you can look up for betting against all sorts of things if you don't want to short or buy puts. (E.g. if you really think the S&P or QQQ is going to drop by a significant amount over a period of time, not a single-day drop.) DOG is 1x inverse DJIA. PSQ is 1x inverse QQQ. SH is 1x inverse S&P 500. There are leveraged versions of these, but you can lose money real quick in those if you're wrong.

2021-06-03 15:14:09,stocks,👀
2021-06-03 18:53:50,stocks,That is definitely not the best way to hedge
2021-06-03 14:11:17,stocks,"The ""Chinese FUD"" (It looks like Chinese Food) is the only reason to stay away from BABA. So why not include it? You are asking people to look at a stock/comoany, but not to look at the massive risks surrounding it. So your argument is pointless. If you don't take risks into account every stock on the market is the best stock ever."
2021-06-03 14:20:23,stocks,"Finally, I was waiting for today's BABA thread."
2021-06-03 14:24:53,stocks,"If China were an open and free society and not a Communist dictatorship, many things in this world would look very different. China is by far the largest (soon to be) developed market in the world and the potential is absolutely huge.

But you can't just exclude that very real problem. The CCP giveth, and the CCP taketh away at the leaderships pleasure."
2021-06-03 15:51:28,stocks,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but Baba has a p/e in the low 20s doesn’t it? Amazons is what - 50 or 60? That would suggest people are very bearish on it...?"
2021-06-03 14:55:36,stocks,"There needs to be a mega thread for BABA... someone posts about it almost every day whether it’s a bear or a bull post, 99% of the time, it’s the same body evidence, either a “it’s so undervalued, why?!” Or “China govt is going to ruin this company, sell!!” 

I hold shares of BABA and even I am tired of seeing these posts here daily..."
2021-06-03 19:04:08,stocks,Sadly idiots in this thread don’t know how to read.
2021-06-03 14:43:28,stocks,Is baba a good buy?
2021-06-03 17:11:18,stocks,"One thing I think OP got wrong is that it's not FUD anymore when it's been proven time and again that the Chinese government will make sudden moves that depress a stock's price.

Sure, if we're just using make-believe companies, then yes, BABA is potentially cheaper than it should be."
2021-06-03 14:23:33,stocks,"It's not an argument, it's a question. 

The numbers don't show it as a valued play, it's not like it's undervalued because of the Chinese FUD (I did that on purpose btw). So why not just invest in Amazon or another online retailer? Unless I'm missing something, it does less then 1/5 the sales and revenue of Amazon but is valued 1/3 as high."
2021-06-03 14:24:34,stocks,"I'll be making one again tomorrow, same time"
2021-06-03 14:27:43,stocks,"Right but my point is that even if China is an open and free society, Ali Baba still doesn't look undervalued compared to other online retails, Amazon being the first example"
2021-06-03 16:13:14,stocks,if you're not gonna read the post then idk why you would bother commenting
2021-06-03 17:14:51,stocks,"It's pretty close to its 52-week low, so yes, there's potential for it to go up (to around $319). That said, the potential may not be realized in the near term. So from a trading standpoint, there are better near-term options than BABA, without the concern that a government will take any big action against the company without due process."
2021-06-03 14:34:38,stocks,"Yes, your better off with Amazon in my opinion and if you still want some Asian E Commerce exposure maybe look into Coupang. Its fairly valued and doesn't have the same risk as Baba since its not in China."
2021-06-03 14:12:43,stocks,Just an FYI most of these companies aren’t even listed on US exchanges. It would take a brokerage that allows foreign exchange purchases to even hold these companies. The big tech companies that Reddit talks about are safe from this expanded ban.
2021-06-03 18:02:00,stocks,Out of curiosity do other countries have such lists? Like nationals of country X can't own say Raytheon? Suppose it wouldn't matter as much compared to the US capital market
2021-06-03 17:30:05,stocks,I remember when people were saying biden is a puppet of the CCP
2021-06-03 17:22:51,stocks,I've got NIO... kinda nervous this is even being discussed again.
2021-06-03 17:17:01,stocks,"Makes me anxious about holding Chinese ADRs that are basically glorified IOU notes to begin with and then these ban talks on top of that... Maybe, if I can't buy real shares on HK I shouldn't be playing with it at all..."

2021-06-03 18:15:32,stocks,how does this affect icln? last I checked they had some holdings in hsi listed Chinese stocks
2021-06-03 17:41:30,stocks,But god forbid i mention literally anywhere that Chinese stocks are a risky investment. Just get downvoted into oblivion
2021-06-03 14:01:46,stocks,So Trump was right again…
2021-06-03 19:59:18,stocks,"There you have it, Biden is continuing down the road to confrontation instead of cooperation.  Imagine all the good that could've happened for the world if the US and China cooperated.  But the US can't fathom not being the strongest country and is now dead set on undermining China's growth.  But competition from China is tough, hope the US is prepared for defeat."
2021-06-03 16:39:17,stocks,Fuck this senile demented boomer
2021-06-03 18:41:06,stocks,Thanks. Could be part of the reason why QCOM's stock price  took a dive.

2021-06-03 19:56:07,stocks,RIP BABA even though it's unrelated
2021-06-03 18:44:59,stocks,I think what’s really driving this is China is out-teching the US. Look at Intel getting smoked by TSM. Tesla is rapidly losing market share to Chinese EVs
2021-06-03 16:18:26,stocks,"Safe for now, the fact that this discussion is on the table again still raises the political risk a bit. Although judging by the price action on some of those stocks it doesn't seem like the market agrees yet."
2021-06-03 16:41:19,stocks,"Are US funds banned from owning shares? If so, the funds will have to liquidate en masse and non-US investors will be able to scoop them up cheaply"
2021-06-03 17:27:54,stocks,"As someone has said, not yet. But also, I wouldn't rule out BABA or TCEHY being banned too. Remember what happened to Huawei or ZTE which were big names back then. US declared that they are working with Chinese military (like US tech does not work for US military...) and that was that. Bans, sanctions, all that. Huawei got practically destroyed. Went from 5g leader to not being able to make their equipment. Don't say that can't happen to other Chinese companies."
2021-06-03 17:59:05,stocks,They still will despite all evidence to the contrary.

2021-06-03 16:51:56,stocks,"I think any US entities have a year from the time this ban goes into place to divest their holdings. 

And honestly, I want to see the numbers of how much is actually invested by US investors into these companies. Cause I doubt it’s as big as we think it is, since none of these companies seem like they are popular with US investors, at least on the retail side of things."
2021-06-03 17:56:49,stocks,"Let's be clear, Huawei's involvement with the Chinese government is nothing like the US government and Verizon or AT&T. The fact is that Huawei and the Chinese government are nearly one and the same, with Huawei allowing unfettered access to its phone technology and networks. So when Huawei was pushing HARD to build 5G networks in Western countries, thus allowing the Chinese government control of communications and the ability to monitor and track people at will, said western countries took exception.

When it comes to BABA or other non-State owned companies, yes, they are still tightly aligned with the State. However, the US has no reason to see BABA or other tech companies as a threat similar to Huawei. The situation with Huawei was unique and should talked about as such."

2021-06-03 18:09:16,stocks,"I think you are looking at it from purely logical perspective and discounting geopolitics. Just to come back to Huawei for a second. US could have said we don't use your 5G equipment and that's final. But that's not all they did. They forbid Google licensing Android to them, they forbid everyone from selling chips from them, they even made a big fuss about Seagate selling HDDs to them. It wasn't just about 5G equipment. They destroyed the whole company just to spite China. Now, yes BABA probably don't care about spying on US but say if their cloud business really takes off, and there are these tensions with China and US really wants to damage China in any way they could just say BABA is selling software to Chinese military to enslave muslim minorities or some such bullshit and we would see all sorts of bans and sanctions. Certainly say goodbye to your ADRs. Logical? No. Makes sense to weaken your biggest rival in any way in geopolitical sense? Yea. I would not think something like that is impossible."

2021-06-03 19:54:03,stocks,I think the better way to put it is that taiwan is not currently under the control of the CCP. the Taiwanese government's official name is the Republic of China and they controlled mainland China from 1911 until thier retreat to taiwan during the Chinese civil war in 1949 and took over Taiwan from the Japanese in 1945
2021-06-03 18:46:20,stocks,[removed]
2021-06-03 18:35:23,stocks,"Yes, but the ones that we see popular on Reddit like FUTU, NIO, and EH are where most of the mid to small cap money is. These 59 companies that are being banned are not easily accessed for most investors and as far as I know not popular cause of that. 

If this ban targeted companies like NIO and the popular small caps, this would be a way bigger deal at the moment. But it’s not, so I’m not worried about my portfolio that has an allocated amount of Chinese tech holdings right now.

Edit: Thought JMIA was Chinese for some reason, so edited it out."

2021-06-03 14:05:37,stocks,"- Would the US government even allow such a sale or merger?

- Would the Ford Family even consider the idea?

- Aren’t the company cultures of Ford and Tesla drastically different? Ford has more in common with foreign car makers like Toyota or Honda then they do with a tech-oriented company like Tesla."
2021-06-03 14:02:22,stocks,Lmaoooooooo
2021-06-03 14:12:02,stocks,"It will never happen.  In order for a merger like this to happen Ford would get a deeper peak into the financials.  Once they discover that most of the income Tesla pretends to have is coming from carbon offsets, crypto and accounting recipes from ""20 top vegan recipes to use a pressure cooker"" F would run away from the table.  

Just because the SEC turns a blind eye to every time Musk tweets in a last ditch effort to bring the stock price back up doesn't mean that F would."
2021-06-03 14:15:16,stocks,"Musk has repeatedly voiced that the ""dinosaur"" automobile manufacturers have no chance of competing with him because they have assets that turn into liabilities during the transition to ev.  Theres no chance he will merge with them if that's his perspective, from his perspective it would be a hindrance to tsla to merge it with a company with depreciating assets."
2021-06-03 13:54:59,stocks,"Not a chance in hell. Ford is off to a decent start with their EVs, but what most don't realize is it's going to be unprofitable for many years to come and that's not including the Osborne effect with their ICE vehicles. 

What many believe are assets - equipment, engineers to name a few - are really liabilities needing to be flushed out, rebuilt and retrained (new engineers). 

Ford is the only US based EV I see surviving the decade. GM is more show than anything else. Huge mistake hyping up a Hummer EV that's not going to be available for a few years. They needed to do what Ford did and focus on their Silverado.

Back to your question though. Tesla is vertically integrated and the cultures are no where near compatible. Note: this isn't about valuation or their futures. They simply have no need for acquiring any legacy manufacturer. Tech and battery side, that's the only possibility I see."
2021-06-03 14:03:17,stocks,"Ford family would never sell, only option would be a hostile takeover if possible."
2021-06-03 14:03:20,stocks,"it's an interesting question but Ford has now finally seen the light- in a good way! and has gotten ahold of what the future will be. 

Google is also a deep ally of Ford and is far ahead in autonomous driving and AI. If I'm Ford, there is no way in hell I'd let Tesla buy me out. The legacy, the new lineups, the following, the infrastructure... No f'n way.

Good news is that I see Ford being very undervalued, even now. I believe Ford is actually a $40-50 stock. Seriously. And I have put my money where my mouth is on options as well as Ford stock. I see Ford doing very very well in the near, mid, and long-term (without Tesla)."

2021-06-03 13:59:51,stocks,"Stuff like this is why I love reddit. Thank you. Though I do disagree about the osborne effect in regards to the F-150 and other offerings. I think the chip shortage and lack of production is allowing Ford to see what the demand is and then gear their production to meet it. So yes, they may lose some gas powered customers to EV, but that will be more profitable especially with their new subscription based software that all the carmakers seem to be sneaking into their next gen EV's."

2021-06-03 13:43:44,stocks,"If you're under $25k balance, your broker will limit the weekly trades allowed. Makes it hard to ""day trade"" under those restrictions. Also, finding a volatile enough stock to realize a large enough gain on few trades. The more trades you make, the higher probability that you will hit some bad trades.

I would add to the list time-cost opportunity. Are you working a day job? This would limit your screen time to search and trade these stocks during market hours. Quit your job to free time up? Your fund source is now killed.

There's nothing easy about doing what you're laying out."
2021-06-03 15:25:49,stocks,"Not to discourage your enthusiasm but watching a stock you just bought for $20 a share drop to $19 then $18 then $17 and maybe even lower is much harder than you think. You believe it will go up to $25 a share? Well it can take minutes, hours, days, and even years. Sometimes it never recovers. Do you sell? Keep holding? Once you’ve been through that you’ll understand why people say everything you wrote. 

The market as a whole has gone up over time but each individual stock has its own chart and doesn’t always follow the market. Do tons of research and start small.  

Either you are cut out for the roller coaster ride and it doesn’t bother you (maybe you love it) or you decide ETFs (less volatility) are your better option."
2021-06-03 16:07:03,stocks,Wow you’re a genius!  Why hasn’t anyone else thought of this?!?!
2021-06-03 13:31:10,stocks,And what goes up doesn’t always go down.

If you sold at a loss and rebought, then your loss is no longer a valid tax deduction. If you sold at a gain, there's nothing to consider."
2021-06-03 12:53:11,stocks,"It seems like a nasty penalty to me because I bought into the stock, and was immediately down $300 on it due to getting my cost readjusted. I wouldn't have bought back in if I had known! But maybe I'm not seeing the bigger picture since I don't file my taxes and don't know much about claiming losses and such.

Anyways, I'm still a bit confused, as it says I have to wait 30 days or so after in order to not get washed out again. But since I sold those washed shares for a profit, I would assume I'm out of the woods and can rebuy safely now.. Hoping for confirmation on this if possible. Thank you"
2021-06-03 13:14:55,stocks,"I'm trying very hard to follow along with what you're doing.

You bought a stock. Your cost was $X. You sold that stock for $Y. You lost $Z - which is a capital gains loss on your taxes.

You then rebought the stock for $Y. There's no ""cost readjustment"". You paid $Y- that's it. You may be dollar cost averaging with the remaining shares you own, but you don't have a cost readjustment because you have a wash sale.

You don't have some broker trying a failed ""gains harvest"" strategy?"
2021-06-03 13:53:41,stocks,"There was cost readjustment though, according to my TD account. I bought the shares @ 13.2 and then woke up next day to see the cost per share had risen to 14.7 in my account. 2nd time this has happened to me now.

I then waited and sold the remaining shares for 14.8 and made a slight profit. Now I'm looking to buy back in and really hoping I don't get my cost jacked up again is all.

EDIT: Maybe you're right.. I added up the actual amount of money I spent on the shares, and then how much I made when I sold. Made a good $300 profit. So maybe the purchase price going up in my TD account is meaningless? SO CONFUSED!!!"

2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Meme stocks are Ponzi schemes, and too many investors are falling for it. The sentiment on Reddit seems to be short percentage of a bunch of meme stocks were decreased by naked shorting, creating an endless amount of shorts that are hidden within ETFs and other investment vehicles. If this ends up being true, the entire market will collapse as the shorts are covered.
 
However, the stock prices of these stocks are most certainly going up due to FOMO and more savvy investors being able to take advantage of others less understanding of the stock market. There are definitely some whales out there that have profited big time by these stocks going up and down like they have been the past few months.
 
If the shorts were truly covering the prices would be 10x higher than they are today, causing most likely a Great Recession event. Which won’t come to fruition.
 
It’s a shame because there’s going to be a lot of investors who lose a lot of money that they can’t afford to lose. 
 
Most of the DD people post is badly misinterpreted data or straight up lies. But for some reason, whenever someone points that out they are heavily downvoted.

Let me put it this way, if you know a stock is very overvalued you would sell instantly. But if you knew a stock was artificially being pushed down in value, would you not buy it since you know it will go up? 

You can say it might never go up but then you could use that same logic to the overvalued stock that it may never go down."

Maybe the speculation is correct, maybe this will lead to a crash, maybe it wont, if you have the money to spare why not ride along? Worst case scenario you lose your entire investment, best case scenario you gain ridiculous amounts of money.

2021-06-03 13:18:28,stocks,Someone who moves 5K out of savings one day to buy GME because they saw on TikTok that it's going to be +60% tomorrow is not an investor. And these are the people most often burned.
2021-06-03 17:44:41,stocks,there's always gonna be bag holders in any situation
2021-06-03 16:37:43,stocks,"I think the people who just bought a stock at its downturn during covid and are still holding it, expecting it to grow as covid restrictions end, far outnumber the few who bought in at a high price and expect it to explode.

In the last six months there was only a handful of days you could have bought GME and held it, and be down money right now. I think I counted six days in the last six months.

For AMC only yesterday could you have bought it and be down. You would have lost money if you sold any day before yesterday 

I don't think it's a particularly crazy or meme level stock view to buy a stock when it's low due to covid restrictions, and hold until you think those restrictions have gone down to a minimum. For most of us, that still hasn't happened."

If you were telling people to sell stocks that in February that then went up by 500-800 percent in a few months, you're probably just embarrassed to admit how bad your advice has been.

What's the difference from your bad advice and any other redditors? They were at least more successful"

2021-06-03 15:35:45,stocks,"I can't tell what you actually believe and your investing goals etc etc.  Market makers, big banks, and hedge funds absolutely do game the market.  Naked shorting is much more common place than we realize, gme/amc were just the tip of the ice berg.  A lot of the AMAs done by Superstonk are very informative and will lead to good literature written by former wallstreeters, I'd suggest listening to them as they're very informative.  Otherwise study the case of refco and their practices of naked shorting, to my understanding they never closed their positions and it still is dragging down the market to this day.  Gme is a play on making the market abusers close their positions for potentially massive gains."

2021-06-03 13:11:38,stocks,"If you think ""everything is overvalued"" then you should either short the market or sit on the sidelines with your cash.  The problem with shorting the market is you will lose everything if you are wrong.  The problem with cash is that rapidly rising inflation is reducing its buying power.  Median U.S. home prices were up 19% year-over-year for April.  Gasoline prices are up 80% for the same period.  The stock market is setting new all time highs every week or two, so is ""everything overvalued""  or just adjusting to a weaker inflationary U.S. dollar?"

I mean, you could look at a price chart and say ""the dollar is overvalued so really this company is trading at a fair value"".  But if the PE is 40 right now without good fundamentals to back it up, that's still an indication (although not the only one) that it's overvalued. 

Valuations are high right now in terms of dollar-value, which could be explained by an overvalued dollar, but other metrics of overvaluation cannot be explained that way.  In this market we're seeing both."

2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Why does pre market exist and why are options not included? Seems pretty unfair that the market is only “open” from 9:30-4pm yet trading can still take place practically all day long. It really sets you up for failure when a stock closed high but then opens at half its price. I know that “I can trade after hours too” but seriously I cant possibly pay attention to something from 4am-8pm every day. 

And why aren’t options tradable? I am supposed to just sit there and watch my options loss all its value in pre market but cant do anything about it? If the price can change after hours why cant I tend to my options? 

Doesn’t make sense to me."
2021-06-03 12:17:39,stocks,"Mostly to concentrate liquidity.

Most options aren't sufficiently liquid (ITM and OTM ones) even during normal open market hours with wide big ask spreads.

Even stocks when they trade in premarket or afterhours have bad liquidity.

A stock has just a single ticker, but for every stock there are maybe hundreds of options prices across strikes and all expiries.

For market markers it isn't worth the trouble in non market hours for options. They generally have to hedge their option positions they are selling you by immediately buying/selling stocks but the afterhour stocks market isn't liquid enough to do it efficiently. 

Thus providing MM activity of those hundreds of quotes for each share which themselves are illiquid isn't lucrative, hence nobody demands afterhours for options.

It is better to have option buyers/ seller concentrate their trade activities in limited market hours window than spreading it over entire day. 

Index futures which are way more liquid for example are allowed to trade 23 hours each day. So it is all about liquidity."
2021-06-03 13:40:24,stocks,"**Market hours:** Those are a hold-over from non-electronic trading days. It's hard to change up the status quo. It forces everyone to trade in the same time period and not give an advantage to hedge funds located in different time zones. There's no reason this couldn't open up more, but it's been this way for its entire history up until about 2 years ago so it'll take time to change

&#x200B;

**After hours trading:** This isn't done on the same market as the ""market is open"" market. It's happening on what is called the ECN. This system matches up buyers and sellers and is independent of the market price. That's why a stock can run up or down crazy amounts after hours. But when the market opens the prices in the AH don't matter - that's why they snap to the opening price. AH price CAN affect market price, but usually the volume in the AH is so low compared to the open market that it really doesn't. This isn't to screw the retail trader, it's just the way it works.

Imagine you and a buddy buy a bunch of candy and after the grocery store closes you decide to sell the candy. You may be able to drive the price up because the supply is low and demand is high, but as soon as the store opens again the price of that candy is going to snap back to market prices

&#x200B;

**Options:** Options prices are affected by the stock prices. As stated above, after market close the actual, real price of the stock isn't moving so options prices aren't moving either. You selling your candy after the store closes isn't affecting the price of the candy in the store, so the options you bought for that store candy isn't changing price either. You can't trade options after hours because they're in the grocery store with the candy and the store is closed. That's not to screw you, it's just like asking ""Why isn't my gas mileage improving"" when your car is off. Because you're not moving."

I feel like a 9 to 9 for US markets would be ideal and eliminate some of the late day frenzy of what is basically lunch time for west coast investors."
2021-06-03 16:56:49,stocks,"I have noticed this as well, and haven't taken the time to research why the market is structured in the way that it is so that the dynamic you describe takes place, where you can literally watch the value of your options disappear in aftermarket trading ... Since an  after hours tradable stock continues to be traded, but it's underlying options cannot be traded. I really don't know why that is the way it is, but when I buy options I tend to look in advance as to whether or not a stock can be traded after hours and I take that under consideration when I buy/sell options.

 Options with high volatility and aftermarket trading capabilities I stay away from.. just never know what's going to happen..I also tried to go down the rabbit hole of figuring out how the trades get done overnight. What I mean is, let's say a given piece of news releases between market close and market open, and that news will move the market price of a given stock. 

The first thing I would do is execute an order in response to that news. Let's say it's positive news on the stock, and I'm sitting in put options, so maybe I want to sell the put options the very first thing in the morning.  How are the order tickets prioritized on market open? 

 I have never been able to find a straight answer to that question.  E-Trade won't disclose how it works, they even claim to not know how it works.. I've asked other experienced brokers and they also claim to not know. Seems sort of a conspicuous piece of information that everybody should know.

All that said, I am a little bit disgusted with quality of responses you received on your question. It'ss a very legitimate question especially for somebody who may be relatively new to the market.

You deserved at least a polite response, and not this vitriolic toxic cesspool that these people have been offering you."

2021-06-03 19:03:09,stocks,"You can trade earlier than 9:30 AM. Some platforms support trading from 4AM until 8PM.

It is a huge advantage if you can do so. This is one of the ways institutional traders are able to run circles around retail traders with certain plays outside regular hours. 

I was trading pre-market and was able to see some of these plays which allowed me to capitalize on them with certain stocks.

Bear in mind, volume tanks outside regular hours. Just because you can buy or sell doesn't mean you'll be able to. Not everyone is going to be up at 4, buying and selling.

That also means prices can fluctuate wildly. It only takes one trade to change the price of an equity. If someone makes one trade at 100% over the regular hours price of the stock, the price will jump 100% which is illusory because price doesn't mean much without volume to back it up.

I don't have the answer to your options question but it would likely be very hard to fill trade orders even if you could. Option trading volume is less than trading volume. After hours, it would probably be tiny."

2021-06-03 18:30:46,stocks,didn’t the stock market start in the USA? at least in the capacity of selling shares to the public. The whole market hours thing was established from that time because people had to physically be present for decades to do the actual trading. If you wanted shares in a company you’d have to take a boat and get over the wall street to buy it with cash i. hand and you’d get a slip of paper saying you owned camping of shares of that company. The pits were the last rendition of that before online trading became a thing.

2021-06-03 12:06:07,stocks,I am asking a genuine question as to why the market hours are the way they are and why you are locked out of options during certain time. Are people just instantly toxic now for no reason if you ask a simple question?
2021-06-03 16:05:55,stocks,Yeah except I am only one human. Financial institutions have computer algorithm trading and can also hire people to work different shifts around the clock. But honestly that part doesnt bother me as much. What I am concerned about it how options are at the mercy of extended hours trading. When the market closes you essentially get locked into your option and only after the market opens again can you trade your option again. Meanwhile the price could have tanked or exploded and you had to sit out.
2021-06-03 11:58:14,stocks,"Im asking why it is this way though. Again, I don’t plan on staring at my screen from 4am-8pm everyday yet a price can change dramatically at any time within that window. And again why are options not included? I am literally trying to learn."

2021-06-03 17:50:28,stocks,"Basically for increasing liquidity.

They act kind of like middle men in option pricing. To do trade without them, you need a person always on the other side of the trade, which is not always possible in options.

For example, if I decide to sell, say a random option, AAPL 17 SEP 117.5, at that exact second, it is possible that no one(normal trader) is interested in buying that one option directly to me. If no one is buying that exactly at that time, there wont be any bid price, hence there wont be a reference price, very illiquid market.

So the job of these market makers is thus to always give you quotes and to act as buyer and sellers of last resort at all the time. So even though there may not be normal trader like me trying to buy from me, the market maker gives me a quote and is ready to buy it to me at the bid price at any moment.

Then say a few seconds later, there comes another trader who now wants to buy that option. Now the market marker gives him an ask quote and transfer my option to him.

The market maker thus makes money between the bid value given to me Vs the ask value recieved from other.

Remember there are hundreds of option prices for AAPL for different strike and expiry, but only one stock price, hence it is always possible that nobody may be interested in that one random option at that exact second, unlike AAPL stock where there is always demand, so MMs become more important in options market."
2021-06-03 18:14:02,stocks,"They just sorta popped up, people realized there was profit to be made offering to always be available to buy or sell, with the idea being buyers and sellers don't necessarily want to all buy and sell at the same time, and may pay a premium (crossing the spread) for guaranteed execution now rather than later.


The result in only a few market makers being around in most markets is from competition and the required huge investments in the computing power and algorithms to do it faster and cheaper than the other guy.


Algo MMs are net good for the market. Look at the contraction in bid-ask spread between now and say, 20 years ago. It also makes it possible to buy any one of a million different options, even if there's nobody else who wants to take the other side of the trade. Options would be entirely illiquid without this."

But since GME we've seen a lot more people taking AH prices seriously. Taking BB for example, it closes around $14 and by the time the market is about to open the price is now $18 but the AH market isn't allowing anyone to buy. So hundreds of thousands of people put in limit orders and instantly at the bell all of those orders kick in. Now the price may dip for a second or two but suddenly millions of dollars are being bought up in the first instant and the AH price has effectively managed to force the market price upward.

Long story short, the AH price is technically imaginary until enough people buy into it to make it real"

2021-06-03 18:21:50,stocks,"Not questioning if you understand this, but for more clarity.

Market makers generally do not participate after hours so it dries up liquidity. Less liquidity means **more** price volatility if sentiment is unbalanced, which it is massively for stocks like GME. This has nothing to do with Pre/Post GME, other than the meme stocks having sentiment and price speculation completely untethered from reality.

This low liquidity creates larger moves since the high volume provided by the liquidity stabilizes price. Meaning it requires less shares to move price now. See low float stocks that move quite large in either direction because of limited amount of shares. 

People who are buying do not have enough sellers so sellers can raise the price, same in reverse. If there was volume to provide liquidity, the asks could satisfy the bids and it would take more volume and less balanced sentiment to move price. Ultimately the sentiment will drive price further in any direction.

If there is too little liquidity and equal sentiment, the price will just hang with a wide spread as some stocks do before the open and volume actually comes in.

Low liquidity plus unbalanced sentiment creates large moves. Hence why earnings move so much and why GME and BB move so much after hours.

What is happening with GME and BB is mostly short squeezes, liquidity dries up after hours and people are forced to cover positions (creating fake bullish sentiment) with low volumes on the ask as well as opportunistic buyers adding to the imbalance to the bid/ask in their favor."

I'm bullish on this one because well1 results were pretty good. They also announced today that well2 is showing signs of a petroleum system. This confirms the findings from well1. Stock was up today due to the news. It will just keep climbing till 10 as it did the same trend when well1 results started coming out, but leveled at 6 to 7. During this month and next more results will be released as testing is done. Same as with well1. I think they really found oil and it would be conventional.  Just means cheaper to extract.  
The estimates are around 100 to 120bb if oil is found. A well known oil investor gave it a sp of 72cad for every 10bb of oil found. If all this is proven then it will be a life changing stock. It would still take 5 years or more to reach that level if light crude is found. You can still play the stock as it will go up more from the current sp since well2 results are still pending since they test portions of the core drilled. I'm not a geologist,  but so far there has been nothing but good news on the results. The bad news seems to be coming from nat geo, but no proof as recaf has responded back with proof their claims are untrue. It's high risk, but the 2d mapping should derisk it. End of summer is when these results should start coming out. I'm long for this one even with the risk because that amount of oil is like investing in Saud Arabia back in the 70s."

I have about 70% of my portfolio YOLO’d in them. They make the best solar panels around, and have a pedigree (spin-off from SunPower).

They are heavily kept down by their abysmal margins, but a little known fact is that those bad margins are due to a legacy contract for out-of-market polysilicon at 3x market price. If not for that contract, they would be profitable.

This contract will expire in 2022, so starting Q1 2023, their earnings will have a sudden jump. My plan is to keep buying low until 2023 and retire on the money from all the FOMO caused by their sudden increase of earnings.

They are also planning to expand into higher-margin businesses, such as services instead of just manufacturing. It remains to be seen if they will manage, but even without that, I think it will turn out great."

2021-06-03 16:22:31,stocks,"Some great stocks that I've been following since July 2020 that I think are just solid plays:

AGCO - Agriculture equipment manufacturing company. They're up 200% since July 2020, and have crossed into 52week high territory. they just pulled back for some consolidation, but could see another breakout. Lots of room to grow, and investing in agriculture can help bring diversification to your portfolio.

TEX - Heavy equipment machinery company. Great play if you're betting on infrastructure expansion and projects. Good company with good fundamentals.

PLCE - Children's clothing. This is going to be super hot this summer, and with wide vaccinations we're seeing lots of travel and school reopening. Kids who have been stuck at home for the past 18 months are now going to be outfitted by their parents in clothing that doesn't have holes in it. A lot of their growth may be priced in, but they're a great niche player thats been on a solid trajectory.

BGFV - Sporting goods store. More volatile, but you can see that their revenues are sky rocketing as everyone is ready to break free of the burden of lockdown. DSG is similar in this vein, but BGFV could see more growth.

COF - Financial company that primarily draws revenue through credit cards and financial instruments. Just announced a quarterly dividend. Normally underperforms SPY over long term, but short term financials are booming.

PWR - Electricity infrastructure play. Has put on a reliable 5% a month for almost 12 months straight. Only goes up, but has recently seen some pullback and consolidation.

MTZ - Communications and infrastructure play. like PWR, solid steady growth over the past 12 months.

GPI - Shortage of new cars will drive up the used car market. GPI stands to benefit from that as they own lots of dealerships throughout the US.

AZO - Similar to GPI, but more of a ""pick and shovel"" play. More used cars means more maintenance, which could benefit AZO.

BLMN - Blooming brands if you think the masses will flood chain restaurants. Has climbed nicely with reopening, but is consolidating currently."

I'm very bullish on the future of the entire creative design industry as a whole, and the number of people working in it. Adobe has captured this market in a way that is incredibly hard to compete with because of cross comparability issues.

There might be competition for any individual product that Adobe offers, but Adobe has an entire ecosystem of software that is very hard to break away from.

Their switch to a subscription based model is still relatively new if you take the long view, and I think it will work well for them."

>I'm gonna just take less than 5 min on each... So what you said about BKEP - completely incorrect at $4 a share... they are actually over valued at that price and way over leveraged - and it looks like they have taken out some new revolving credit recently too... 

>AMKBY... So again no clue where you are getting your numbers from LOL or maybe you are misplacing numbers but their total revenue is 39/40Billion for 2020 giving them an EPS of 145 for last year which considering their Price of 14/15$ is a lot - their total assets is about 56B with only 25B on their liabilities side and a net income of 2.9B - they are a great buy IMO but not for any reason you said lol - why would you even look at Market Cap unless you are swing or day trading ??? Where are you getting their earnings to be 15B - looking at their technical trends they are definitely over bought and due for a pull back just from people taking profit anyway... 

>IPIX... This is very much a big bet considering they have never turned a profit and they have been financing their entire operations through investors' money so keep that in mind and their entire success is contingent on this one study at this point which they have been trying to find test subjects for 4 months now (?) Idk if that's true but that seems to be a long time.... Anyway kind of a big red flag unless you have some insider info.... 

>EXROF... They will need to raise more than 50 million that they have now and will likely need more after that... I'm not sure what's happening with their patents or their strategy going forward but just from a fundamental analysis of their finances and nothing else... I mean they are not in the BEST shape but can be a good bet if you REALLY believe that EV is the future no matter what... Personally I don't think so but it may be so who knows.... 

>SIRC... Okay so this one it was NOT easy to find the financials but again where are you pulling the numbers out of? Like which hole did you find em in...? Their YEARLY reported revenue went from 5m in 2019 to 9m in 2020 or about 0.052/share to 0.059/share... To say they are at 8m A MONTH is literally just lying...

As of today the study has full participation. Will conclude near the end of July.
Huge gamble. If their product does what they claim the returns here are infinite. But obviously their drug has existed for 20 years and has not gotten approval as an antibiotic yet. So definitely no one should be going all in. But a few hundred bucks to grab a few thousand lotto tickets? I'm comfortable with that risk."
2021-06-03 16:30:46,stocks,"BKEP you are looking at old stats. Once they sold the pipeline they paid down most of their debt. This is a reit. They will always have some leverage but very very low. 
You need to read the earnings call and look see what they're doing. 
They're also buying back the preferreds which are yielding 10%.

AMKBY - read the last earnings call. Rates have dramatically increased last few months. I work in the shipping industry and am familiar with all that's going on. Management is estimating 15B in earnings this year. With what's going on with shipping rates, equipment and driver shortage, and port congestion I think they set the bar low. They're have 1 1B in buyback and initiated another 5B to be completed in next 2 years. 


IPIX is a tiny biotech. It's got a few good drugs in the pipeline. Brilacidin finishing up Covid trial. Should have results in August. 
If good it will fly if not it will tank. 
So either $100 or 5 cents. 
Brilacidin is one of the best drugs tested in pre-clinical so it may be a fair bet. 

EXROF seems to have a few good products in testing in multiple industries.a Raymond James has a c$9 price target.

Go search WSB for the last thread that mentions an MSO. You might find some from months back.

Also, just FYI, US MSO's gain ~2B per state that legalizes, just adding to their TAM growth. 20% should be consistent for a decade or so from here.

You can interpret that as a negative thing in that they are tied to the hip of Peleton’s fate. or you can say that they snagged a huge customer and that speaks to their ability to grow. If they can do it once why not again? I think worrying about Peloton is short sighted. Affirm is a young company with many opportunities and challenges ahead.

The company's stool DNA test for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is poised for growth. Cologuard was recently recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for all adults at normal risk for developing CRC in the 45-49 year age group. This represents 19 million potential new customers for Cologuard, and Cologuard has been shown to be particularly effective as a screening test (high sensitivity and specificity) in this younger age cohort. There are other significant tailwinds for growth in the next 6-12 months, including sales reps (both Exact Sciences and Pfizer reps) slowly returning to doctors' offices as the pandemic wanes, colonoscopy capacity insufficient to handle giant backlog in CRC screening, electronic ordering now online thru EPIC, and patient wellness visits increasing as things get back to normal.

In addition to Cologuard, Exact Sciences' Oncotype DX test for breast cancer patients is standard of care worldwide for treatment decisions for 70% of women with breast cancer to determine whether chemotherapy may be beneficial. Exact Sciences also purchased PFS Genomics recently, and as a result will bring to market a test to determine whether radiotherapy may be beneficial. These tests will spare countless women from suffering from needless chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Exact Sciences surveillance test for hepatocellular carcinoma - Oncoguard Liver - is currently available and will be rolled out in the next 12 to 18 months with data to be released soon and FDA/CMS approval being sought.

Exact Sciences studies for Cologuard 2.0 and CRC blood test underway and expected to cement Cologuard's position as the leading CRC screening test for adults ages 45 and over at normal risk for developing CRC.

Exact Sciences is developing a multi-cancer blood screening test incorporating recently acquired Thrive Early Detection's CancerSeek technology along with it's own DNA methylation technology to create the world's leading multi-cancer screening test. This would obviously be a game changer with a total addressable market of $25 billion plus annually.

Exact Sciences has the technology, scientists, labs, commercial team, and management in place to become the GLOBAL leader in early cancer detection and treatment! I'm very proud to be fully invested in this company, which is leading the fight against cancer by means of early detection. When detected in its earliest stages, cancer is much more survivable (approximately 90% survival rate vs 10% in late stages) which is why early detection is so important."

One trend is clear, and it's that when there is a crisis, everyone (funds, foreign central banks, investors) flee to the safe haven i.e. USD. As rates are cut and QE and repo are flooded, USD weakens against all currencies, especially in developed markets. At some point, inflation heats up, the rates are raised and QE is tightened, so the dollar rises.

Trying to time it is hard, although not impossible if you track the Libor futures, bond rates, etc. The golden rule is to buy when it's cheap and sell when it's expensive. USD is relatively cheap now; you could say the same about gold miners or a few other stocks.

Another good rule is if you see an opportunity, capitalize on it. For example, oil stocks were cheap in early fall 2020. It didn't matter if the dollar had bottomed by then; those stocks were cheap regardless. Same thing now - if you see a dysfunction in the market (ex: a stock trading lower than it should be, or a house is being sold very cheap), and you want to buy it anyway, just buy it."

$1.42 and $1.45 are key levels in relation to GBP, as 3 and 5 year highs, and currently it's struggling to get past $1.42 despite the money printing making a lot of $! It's likely that the Euro has certain levels, and I'd be inclined to look at those.

Effects of a Dollar Collapse
A sudden dollar collapse would create global economic turmoil. Investors would rush to other currencies, such as the euro, or other assets, such as gold and commodities. Demand for Treasurys would plummet, and interest rates would rise. U.S. import prices would skyrocket, causing inflation.

U.S. exports would be dirt cheap. This would give the economy a brief boost. But in the long run, inflation, high interest rates, and volatility would strangle possible business growth. Unemployment would worsen, sending the United States back into recession or even a depression."

Yes the US has been spending money it doesn't have for years, but it can easily be accelerated and things are in place for that to happen.   I think you are going to deep into what I said where I tried not to be all political esp where I dislike both sides for excessive waste.  Its on topic of this post though to talk about govt spending.

Socialist projects = free college, student loan forgiveness, free healthcare, free housing for poor people, appropriations, growing benefit programs like food stamps, increasing intake of non-citizens and paying for their housing etc..    These are projects the current majority party typically advertises for votes and they cost billions/trillions and once started will be hard to take away.

Crisis = every once in a while the media in the US picks up a story that fits a narrative and inflates it in a way that suddenly the government has to spend money on it.    A future example is the climate crisis - something slightly out of the ordinary will happen like an extra dry month in California and it'll be crisis all over the news, must act now spend trillions to rebuild infrastructure and get rid of ICE vehicles, green new deal etc...  Another future example will be the current majority party and media focusing on every single gun related incident and passing a gun buyback.. that would easily cost $100,000,000,000.       Another example I can see happening is starting up a new war with the media hyping some minor incident like they did with WMDs.  The media tried to do this multiple times to the previous president with North Korea, Russia and others.    There is always something the media focuses on and where the main stream media is in bed with the current majority party it would be easy to sway the public with propaganda into things that cost a ton of money."

China's dominance in the next 10 years will continue to be similar track to what it is now, supply chain and manufacturing dominance, and a high yuan would absolutely choke and drag them from their potential. After 10 years, we'll start to see them moving into AI dominance - at which point they can move the Yuan up in value and into reserve status.  There is no way they'll let the Yuan rise unless we're talking 20 years out. It just hurts more than helps them right now if their goal is to achieve global dominance.

Let’s use your example of an option with an $80 strike. A call option becomes profitable when the stock price goes over your strike price because you are allowed to buy in at that $80 price, then sell for the current higher price.

With a put option it’s the opposite. You make money when the stock falls below your strike because you are allowed to buy in at whatever the current lower price is, and then sell that stock at the strike price of your option.

So as the other comment mentioned, your $80 put option only becomes profitable once the stock price falls below $80."
2021-06-03 08:37:29,stocks,If you don’t understand them DON’T buy them!
2021-06-03 08:29:33,stocks,The bank is always winning.
2021-06-03 07:50:42,stocks,"I also noticed that contracts tend to get more expensive the closer they are in price to the actual price of the stock.

Is it still worth it to get the more expensive contracts, if you believe it will go down to a certain point?"
2021-06-03 08:52:25,stocks,"Thank you, this makes perfect sense.

So, if possible, I want the strike price to be closer to the current price, giving me the best chance of a profit?"
2021-06-03 08:53:19,stocks,That's why I'm trying to understand them.
2021-06-03 15:05:33,stocks,"This!  I'm an engineer so usually in my career when I say to myself ""I don't understand"" that is exciting since it means I have the opportunity to learn, but when it comes to the stock market when I think that, I almost always lose money.  My biggest loss was the ETF MSOS which their holdings are pretty opaque.  It's down $20.4% since I bought on Feb 12, so I think that is a good buy opportunity for others right now.  I apparently didn't understand what I was buying since I thought it would go way up."
2021-06-03 15:06:09,stocks,Don't you mean the casino? /s
2021-06-03 07:52:42,stocks,Thats the premium for owning that price.
2021-06-03 09:13:36,stocks,"That’s generally correct, however as you observed those options are priced accordingly higher, so you would stand to lose more if the trade goes against you.

I gave a pretty simplified example of how options work which didn’t take greeks into account. It’s good to read up on those and try to get a basic understanding of them and how they can change the price of your option independent of the stock price

2021-06-03 07:56:47,stocks,"alright thanks,

I think I understand now."
2021-06-03 10:27:34,stocks,"Do you know if there are other types of investments that are like options but pay you the difference of your bet from the current price, instead of paying you for the amount past your bet?"
2021-06-03 19:15:27,stocks,"... That's just a put option ATM (at the current price) with a date in the future, when it presumably costs less.  

Theoretically you can then buy the asset, then exercise the option to sell it at the higher price."

2021-06-03 10:40:37,stocks,Huh. I’ve been on r/stocks for years. I never knew we had a daily meme stock thread. I guess this thread gets buried under all the AMC and GME posts.
2021-06-03 12:26:03,stocks,Does it look like BB is set to make a similar run like AMC closer towards the end of the day/tomorrow?? Im convinced it is...wondering what everyone's opinion on this almost definite jump? Thanks in advance for everyone's grand wisdom:D
2021-06-03 11:25:03,stocks,"Regardless if AMC, (BB) blackberry, Cinemark or Naked is meme/reddit powered. I want to see these companies succeed! I have grown up with AMC & CNK. Am more of a cinemark guy now just because of those comfy seats! Love those seats. Pre-pandemi, I remember seeing a couple sleeping in these chairs after the movie ended lol. I couldn't believe it 😆. I will continue to support these companies. 

I've always said I would always goto the movies because of it's the experience of going with family & friends. Remember the clapping and cheering of Marvel movies right as the movie started. Or when everyone is laughing at some funny scene. Love it and cannot get that experience at home w/ streaming service. 

Am a hold on a these companies as long with others not listed. Lets support our companies and can't wait to see what AMC/CNK to do with our contributions. Hopefully to make our movie experience even better!!!"
2021-06-03 10:38:48,stocks,Please help me options nerds - I got caught with my pants down on some Sept covered 20Cs on B B. Really don't want to buy them back right now. Thinking about selling shares and running the risk of holding on to the calls naked as I feel it's unlikely I actually get assigned and then I can buy the contracts back after the crash. Is this totally idiotic? Was looking at rolling them to an earlier but obviously the numbers aren't great there. And I fear the stock will be back in single digits by Sept.
2021-06-03 11:43:22,stocks,So is this a congratulations to all the new bagholders? Selling stocks should be a heavy signal that a company doesn't believe in a MOASS? Or what do you guys think?

2021-06-03 12:16:43,stocks,Never sell naked. If the stock does infact run up to those levels (unlikely imo) you would be caught with far worse than your pants down. Either hold and collect the premium or buy a put to hedge your stocks

2021-06-03 13:47:17,stocks,"For real though, who is buying up all these meme stocks? The volume is absolutely bonkers. BB volume is at 424 million, which is 2100% above its 65 day average and nearly the entire float. AMC volume is 406m which is 335% above its 65 day average and like 80% of its entire float. WKHS is at 125m which is 953% above its 65 day average and actually more than its public float. 

This can't possibly just be due to retail investors, huge institutions are clearly trading these stocks too.

2021-06-03 19:25:24,stocks,Thats kind of what I do. I actually have two accounts outside of my 401k. I use a roth for long term stupid index funds/etfs.

I did like 200 dollar investment into GRWG when it was four dollars a share and sold some when it hit like 50.

2021-06-03 05:42:10,stocks,Instead of coping I guess it is better to make it clear to oneself that this is just how investing works. You lose some and you win some and after a while you will win more then you lose. There will always be another play!
2021-06-03 07:43:16,stocks,"I remember that I didn't have a time machine, so I was only able to use reason, valuation, and risk assessment to make my decision. Using those, GME at $45 and AMC at $10 are patently absurd. Congrats to anyone making money on them. But those are not valuations that are tethered in any way to reality as we know it, so I sat on the sidelines. 

You can also try remembering that you could have gotten in on COIN at over $400. Or HYLN over $50. Playing the hype game is dangerous."
2021-06-03 06:00:31,stocks,I'm getting at least $10k into BB tomorrow homie. It hasn't even properly begun and WSB is salivating. How will you feel if it hits $30 by EOD and you missed it? Just be disciplined about your sell price and lock in a good profit.

If today doesn't have to do with the meme stocks (I'm skeptical because of the behavior by the major averages yesterday, it was very sketchy), the problem of today is the S&P and Dow took way, way too long to break out of the top of this range.

This isn’t even the first time that cults have formed around stocks. One of the reasons that the Great Depression hammered the country so hard is because even regular joes living normal lives were taking out loans to buy certain stocks. During the roaring 20’s, it was common for people to word-of-mouth pump stuff and people with little money would take out a loan and buy the stock because the stock would certainly earn more than the loan. When the markets crashed, the loans got defaulted, and people had no equity or collateral worth seizing so the lenders went belly up alongside them."

Just my anecdotal evidence, but I say it's an accurate predicting 60%ish of the time for a good gain or loss ( to short ).  But you aren the only one looking at it, so the best advantage you can gain is predicting it BEFORE the cross happens."

By itself it doesn't mean much unless you rely on momentum alone. In context it can have utility."

2021-06-03 11:12:41,stocks,which ones
2021-06-03 11:27:37,stocks,"I have a long way to go for that, I still have ICLN (@$32.19), NIO ($56.88), ARKK ($140.86), ARKG (@$110.92), ARKF (@$55.57) and PRNT (@$45.33). 

I started investing in November last year (I only had 401k before, which is mostly S&P 500) and did not know what I was doing and got carried with reddit hype. Though I have sorted out my future portfolio and I am selling the ones I don't want to have in future."
2021-06-03 07:46:03,stocks,Leap puts might be a solid idea. It seems like the fall is already priced into options. Mightnt even be profitable.
2021-06-03 07:12:53,stocks,Because short squeeze pops up the price and then it comes back down. Puts just take advantage of that. Same with GME. Yes it went up to $400+ but it then went back down to 40-ish
2021-06-03 10:06:53,stocks,Big F
2021-06-03 10:07:15,stocks,I don't see it going above 18. Thoughts?
2021-06-03 14:03:01,stocks,">  front run tech stock earnings again

2021-06-03 12:31:36,stocks,"Is there a reason why? I'd normally imagine for options to do well, it has to go up, if you're buying calls, or down, it you're buying puts, but holding on till it expires, just drops the value doesn't it?"

2021-06-03 07:31:42,stocks,"Ya, I have to do some math on it, but trading on 3% allows me to also use a bit of leverage, should the market fall. 33% CGT is also a bitch, so if I can see myself gaining more through the 2nd option as time plays out, I might go with it."
2021-06-03 11:40:58,stocks,"Yeah that's what I was thinking myself, currently own some AMD and I'm going to buy Nvidia but may wait till the split, but I don't see the ETF providing me a better return than owning these two outright.

2021-06-03 06:23:06,stocks,"Not invested in GME but the play is specialty e-commerce. Chewy showed you could do it on a large scale and people believe GME can do the same. I can see physical copies sticking around for awhile yet and could almost be the gaming equivalent of vinyl for music. You can already see this phenomenon a bit with the renewed interest in collecting retro games, plus collector's editions of AAA titles always seem to sell pretty well so if nothing else that will remain."
2021-06-03 07:24:51,stocks,I mean I don’t actually think it’s going to happen but at least in theory they could successfully switch to an e-commerce model. AMC is just movie theaters and I haven’t even heard any theories about how they could pivot to something that isn’t a dying industry.
2021-06-03 09:55:36,stocks,Sold @ $19 at open this morning. Feel fucking good not to be holding this bag anymore but I'll jump back in when it drops to <$10

He is a genius just not in the way you were hoping for."
2021-06-03 07:26:00,stocks,AMC was dying before COVID happened. There’s little reason to go to a movie theatre anymore when you can get a 75 inch 4K TV in your living room for less than $1000.

2021-06-03 15:47:50,stocks,The memes fell off for a long while so they probably felt it wasn’t worth the trouble. Then they came back to life. Although I do think there have been meme threads recently. Just not pinned

2021-06-03 11:33:22,stocks,It's cute that some retail investors think they're in the driver's seat with that.
2021-06-03 18:10:07,stocks,"we already at inflation, market knows these “growth” stocks are fucked once feds step in and increase interest rates."
2021-06-03 16:02:09,stocks,I think to some regard yes. GME feels like a pandora's box event and now you will have a ton of investors looking for any short squeeze. People want to be rich and get rich as quickly and and easy as possible.
2021-06-03 10:31:25,stocks,Yes probably should... I am feeling greedy on this one

2021-06-03 13:14:22,stocks,I personally own a peloton and find myself using it less than ever now that everything is reopened. It was a great pandemic stock but they may need to rely more on precor for post-pandemic growth.

2021-06-03 19:58:23,stocks,Lil bit of both. My cost avg is 26$ CAD and it's been struggling to get back over 20 ever since February. Market mentality seems to have changed since February and I'm holding a few too many speculative growth stocks that have suffered hard.
2021-06-03 08:17:30,stocks,"My man. Cheers! Some of these responses act like they’re so smart and “above the meme plays” or some shit. Which is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard, if they think big smart institutional money isn’t playing these things and banking themselves.

2021-06-03 10:47:46,stocks,Wow yeah that doesn't sound very fun. Thanks for the warning. My cost average was $14 so just want to get out of this at even. But looks like I will have to take a slight loss given how expensive the CCs are to buy back.

2021-06-03 11:11:12,stocks,I just bought back the CCs on this dip (hopefully just a dip?) so I am now in the clear. hoping for another green dildo so I can end this misery. cost basis $14.74

He asked about “tech”, such a vague term, you have no idea what HE means by it, and he has no idea what YOU mean by it, unless there is some telepathic communication I’m missing.

For what we know, one of you may be talking of Microsoft and the other of Fastly.

Especially since he says he has a 4 years horizon, and “tech” is currently weak. If you look on a timeframe of the past 4 years, I’m not sure where this weakness is."

But essentially institutional holders are the only people that have enough capital to trade enough stocks to really move the market. Aside from meme stocks (and TBH, who the hell knows what is going on there), retail traders don't have enough capital to move the market. Retail traders like us are basically a few drops of water in the ocean to those folks.

Our trading strategies are different. They more or less make the waves, and we ride what they send out."
2021-06-03 11:48:13,stocks,"I don’t know the exact answer, only observations. My feeling is that people were moving their money to trade these meme stocks which made other people jittery. This happened early this year too (whenever the meme stocks were on full blast the broader market sold off).

Aka you won’t the stock to stay flat or go lower so the option you sold expires worthless and you keep the premium.

When it goes HIGHER is when you get fucked, unlimited risk cause there’s no limit to how high stocks can go.

Unless you are an expert on their field yourself and can accurately judge the business merits on your own - how realistic are their growth plans and how well they can execute them, what is their present and possible future competition, which risks - but if that was the case you wouldn’t be asking here.

Well 'tapering' necessarily includes shrinking the balance sheet. The question is just at what point. Conceptually, the Fed Reserve might say tapering should start with unwinding their balance sheet *before* significant interest rate cuts. 

Currently they're unwinding their liquidity facilities they started in 2020 for COVID without rate increases, so it wouldn't be out of left field if they start the same for all the other unusual strategies they've developed

It’s probably part of a longer-term strategy as the US looks to outperform the Chinese economy, which is slated to surpass the US in GDP within the next few years (obviously not in GDP per capita, though).

China has been massively self-investing the way that the US should for future growth, and as a result they’re running hot and very worried about projected population decline because that deflation will hit in the next decade, so if they react too sharply to deflate they may end up with a pendulum that swings too far.

Chinese companies also aren’t doing so hot in terms of accurate financial reporting, so that’s scaring investors off.

How can someone invest in foreign companies and not care about international politics? I’d also be worried about global pushback against Chinese exports if investigations into the origin of covid-19 show uncertainty about China’s official narrative. The US and Euro bloc may well end up working together against them."

2021-06-03 16:58:56,stocks,"So, assuming a diversified basket of solid proven companies, the best in their fields, the risk probably isn’t so much in them continuing to make money, but future market conditions affecting their shares valuation.

In 4 years I’d assume they’ll do well, but I know nothing.

In the next 6-9 months I’d expect them to be largely flat or see high volatility. No amazing increases in share price, probably.
On one hand, US big tech is making lots of money, which should put a floor on their valutation.
But they also face headwinds. Market conditions are going to become less favorable, with increasing interest rates and taxation.

If Biden’s tax increases pass, we should also see some additional volatility as investors sell to lock gains on the old lower tax rates and buy again. Maybe this will happen in a orderly way, or maybe we will see some short term senseless tantrum like it happened in February as bond yells rose. Who knows.

Then there are the usual risks due to international tensions, which can lead to supply chain disruptions, costs increases, protectionism and loss of markets access.
(I seem to be the only person believing there is a real possibility of China acting heavy antitrust measures against Apple, for example, if the latter keeps fast gaining market share there).
Etc etc. Risks of financial crises, antitrust pressure, social inequality and stability, so on.

TLDR:
When investing in a well balanced portfolio, yuor risk comes largely from market conditions, so is most important to stay updated on the macroeconomic and political situation.

So say I bought 1 contract on a stock at a strike price of $45 at a premium of $.10. If the price is $40 at the time of expiration how much money do I stand to lose. Only the cost of the premium? Or am i then forced to buy 100 shares at the price of $45?"

From what I understand, say I buy 1 call contract for a week expiration at $1 I understand that I pay $100 for a strike price of $9 then 5 days later price jumped to $15.

So now I have $400 minus the contract I bought, do I buy 100 of the shares of $900? does that mean I have to top off $500 so I can sell the share for $1500??

Or when I bought the contract I automatically have the 100 shares of $9? then I can sell the contract with the price of $15 per share?"

DENVER, May 25, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mydecine Innovations Group (NEO: MYCO) (OTC: MYCOF) (FSE: 0NFA) (“Mydecine” or the “Company”), an emerging biopharma and life sciences company committed to the research, development, and acceptance of alternative nature-sourced medicine for mainstream use, announced today that it has received approval from Health Canada to significantly expand its cultivation capabilities at Mydecine’s Canadian Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) facility at Applied Pharmaceutical Innovation (API).

Under the new guidance from Health Canada, Mydecine will begin construction of expanded cultivation facilities in an effort to scale its supply of pharmaceutical grade psilocybin for both internal clinical research and its industry partners. The increased cultivation will also allow the Company to more efficiently and quickly study the medical utility of naturally occurring psilocybin and psilocybin-like compounds. In addition, Mydecine will be able to take a more extensive look into the diversity and undiscovered chemistry of these compounds and test their medical efficacy in treating mental health conditions like PTSD and addiction.

“Nature has produced a diversity of psilocybin producing fungi, all with their own unique chemistry and much of this diversity remains unstudied or undiscovered. The expansion of our cultivation capabilities will give us a unique lens into better understanding this incredible diversity and how it may be utilized in a therapeutic setting. It will also enhance our ability to produce pharmaceutical grade psilocybin at scale and increase our capacity to support our novel drug candidates like MYCO-001 and study its production in nature,” said Rob Roscow, Chief Science Officer at Mydecine. “Clinical use of natural extracts has seen a recent surge of commercial interest and success and expanding our capabilities to study the cultivation of a multitude of psilocybin producing mushrooms enables incredible intellectual property value and puts us on track for further discoveries of novel molecules and tryptamines.”

“Through our partnership with Mydecine, we’ve built a world class drug discovery and development platform that has positioned the Company for long-term success in its efforts to discover and better understand novel psychedelic molecules,” says API CEO Andrew MacIsaac. “Once completed, the expanded facility will have the capability to cultivate various mushrooms in quantities needed for the expanding clinical trial production needs of Mydecine as well as serve as the one of world's broadest libraries of legally imported psilocybin producing mushrooms under a controlled substance. Tying this with our significant capacity and research infrastructure and you’ve arguably got the most well equipped companies in the space to truly move the field forward.”"

Fungi in general imo are the organic resource that we have ignored, theres a lot of technological advancements that can come from fungi. It's an interesting organic in that we havent studied fungi in the same depth as the other plants, which is where a lot of our medicine comes from. There might even more to it once they start researching. 

Fungi are pretty amazing, they're worth looking into because they're capable of helping us in a lot of different directions. They're just underneath us at all times but we never consider them like we would a plant or animal, but they're just as necessary for our ecosystem. It would literally collapse without fungi."
2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"How do return calculations work? If i were to purchase $100 of a stock who’s share’s cost $500 a piece and $100 of a stock who’s shares cost $0.05 a piece, and they both say that they’re ‘up 10%,’ do I make $10 on each of them? Does it matter what the shares cost?  
I’ve seen many prices go from $0.05 to $0.06, but the increase percentage only states 2%-3%. It this just because the actual price change is closer to $0.0599999999-$0.06, or is the percentage based on something entirely different?  
Along the same topic, is it more beneficial to hold entire shares rather than portions, or is it really just the dollar amount of your investment that counts?"
2021-06-03 02:35:40,stocks,"Despite what people on tik tok tell you, share price doesn't matter. 

Yes, you'd make $10 on both. 

Something trading for less than $0.10 would likely have increments smaller than 1 cent. Plus the bid-ask would probably be relatively huge."

I’m not even sure what a bid-ask is, tbh with you. I just have cashapp and coinbase, and i’ve played around a tiny bit with them, but I really don’t want to be one of those people buying stocks like powerball tickets with no idea what they’re doing. I’m tryna scrounge together at least a little bit of knowledge before putting any real money down.  
Idk if i’m allowed to ask this on here or not, but i doubled my money on that AMC thing and have it scheduled to sell at 9:30 when it (or cashapp) opens. Do you think that’s a good idea?"

2021-06-03 19:13:38,stocks,"You never lose when taking gains. Sell at a price you're comfortable with and laugh about what you could have had over the drinks those gains paid for.

As for when to sell, market open is odd because pre-market trading moves the actual price but the price-of-record doesn't reflect this until the market opens. So if you're selling using a limit (as in ""only sell if above this pre-determined value"") - which you should be - the order may not fill. If you are doing a market sell (which just means sell it for the best price you can get right now) the order will fill, but the price is unpredictable.

The stock market is like an auction house. Bid is what the buyers are offering, and Ask is what the sellers want. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the requested buy and requested sell price. The closer these are, the more liquid the stock (i.e. the faster it moves because buyers and sellers match more easily).

You should read up on a some of these concepts. Investopedia is a good place to start. Good luck with the trading!"
2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Am I understanding this correctly? I want to buy an option on AMC to try it out.

As far as I understand, if I buy 1 call with a strike price of $65 for $12, and the price goes up to $80 tomorrow, I can sell the call for a profit because this now means that I, or someone else, can buy shares at $65 and then be able to sell them for $80.

I feel like I understand options enough but all of the resources I can find online aren't clicking enough.

So would I be right in buying at that strike price?

Or am I off and the strike price is the price that I think the stock will reach? E.g. buy a strike price of $80 while the market price is $65 and if it reaches $80, then I win.

Thanks.  Explain it like I'm 4 ½ if I am incorrect on my understanding."
2021-06-03 02:18:07,stocks,its 12 x 100 so it would cost you 1200$ but yes
2021-06-03 02:30:01,stocks,"Couple of things here.   


First, don't expect that price to be 12.00 when the market opens. After hours option pricing is only good for getting ballparks, but that could easily be 20.00 in the morning.  


Second, yes you add the premium price to your strike price to get your ""break even"" price, so with a 65.00 strike and 12.00 premium you would need the stock price to hit 77.00 or more before you are working on a profit.   


Third, you will pay less of a premium for a further out of the money (OTM) option, but further OTM option price will not rise as quickly either due to the lower delta. You also need to hit your strike price to ""win"", so if the underlying gets to $80 then both the $65 option and the $80 option will ""win"", but the $65 option will win more.   


Finally, I would highly recommend checking out the resources available at r/options to really help you unwind all of this."
2021-06-03 02:24:48,stocks,"I am no financial analyst but imma explain it to you the way I understand it. So the strike price is like your reference, so if, at your expiration date the price of the stock is over that strike price it's good if it's beneath it it's bad(if it's a call)
However the problem is that the closer you get to your expiration date, the lower your option value goes. So the ideal would be to have a far expiration date and have the stock get past the strike price in your case 65 which would make you be able to sell in profit"
2021-06-03 02:22:10,stocks,I believe AMC will hit $100/share tomorrow around 12:00-1:00 PM. These hedge funds are loosing their ass on AMC. Gotta cover their ass by buying more which in hand drives the price even further up.
2021-06-03 02:27:01,stocks,"The options market is continuous. By this I mean the difference between the 65 strike and the 64 strike is typically 50 cents. And they both move together.  When the stock price increases they should both increase by the same amount.  On a per share basis, owning the stock changes the most with the stock price. Every dollar of change in the stock price causes the value of your position to change by a dollar. This is referred to as a delta of one. As you begin to leverage yourself by agreeing to buy it at some higher price with a call option, the delta, or amount of change your position has for a given stock price change decreases from one towards zero. The 1000 strike call won't really change in value at all when the stock moves up or down by a dollar. You can choose whatever delta between zero and one that you like. Of course, options suffer premium decline as their time to expiration approaches. There are tons of other considerations but it would be too much. Considering these trade offs should he enough to get you started"
2021-06-03 02:29:56,stocks,Yesterday morning $73 strike price calls expiring 6/04 cost 61 cents a share at open. During intraday trading those same contracts hit $18 a share. A 3000% increase. And it never even hit the strike price.
2021-06-03 02:43:18,stocks,"options are not as straightforward as shares, have to consider delta, iv, and theta

let's take the 6/4 65C which we'll say is trading for 12. 

scenario 1: amc goes from 65 to 80 in 10 minutes. your call will go up at least 100% because it'll get a nice bump from delta but mostly from IV. if amc can go from 65 to 80, why won't it go to 95 in another 10 minutes? that possibility will be reflected in your option which is why it'll go up. since it's a weekly, it gets the biggest boost. the further out you are, the lower the boost but also on downturns, the lower the loss.

scenario 2: amc trades at 65 for the entire day. your contract will more than likely lose 50% of its value from a combination of iv crush (the stock isbarely moving so its volatility is decreasing) and because theta is murdering it

scenario 3: amc slowly trickles to 80 by your option expiration. your contract will be worth exactly 15 and you'll have a 25% profit. if amc is below 77, you will have lost money."
2021-06-03 02:44:26,stocks,"Your profit will be (stock price @ closing on expiry date - strike price - premium paid) x 100.
Until expiry, the Greeks are playing in the price.
This week va last week, is theta, so the value of time. The more time you have ( later expiry) the higher the premium you pay.
Longer options also have higher delta, so premium change when stock price changes…
I recommend you google “options greeks” and give it a read. Options can be complex if you do not know your basics."

2021-06-03 02:41:53,stocks,"This actually made a lot of sense to me.  So the buy price will most likely be different tomorrow.  So if I placed an order for a $65 strike at $12 after hours, what happens when the market opens and the ask price is now higher? It just never fills?

The way I'm seeing it is that even if I buy it tomorrow at a bit higher ask price and the price jumps a lot tomorrow, I'm still going to make a decent profit from what I invested.

So if the call expires on the 4th at closing, it's worth less because it expires so soon?"
2021-06-03 02:27:29,stocks,"So if mine expires on the 4th at closing but the price jumps to 100 tomorrow like another commenter mentioned, my profits would be lower than if I bought a call that expires in a week?"

2021-06-03 02:37:04,stocks,"You do realize though that the single option costs $1200 though right? Be prepared to lose this full amount. 

AMC is the exact wrong stock for your first options trade since you don’t really understand how they work. There are two days left to until expiration. That means if the stock just sits still Itll decay $600 per day in theta. 

When a stock is this volatile it needs to continue to move massively to make options worth it. I suggest sit this one out and learn more or pick a stock with cheaper options to start."
2021-06-03 02:23:25,stocks,you got it. the call can still go up even if you dont hit the strike price too but obviously worthless if it expires without hitting it
2021-06-03 13:37:50,stocks,"Chaining off of what /u/CanyonLake88 said, if you really want to make an options trade for an option with extreme volatility like AMC, I recommend doing it with one of the lower-volatility meme stocks. I don't recommend doing meme stock options trading at all for a first time, but starting off with one that has lower volatility lets you understand how volatility functions better without being backstabbed by it.

For example, if you don't understand volatility and owned an AMC call option today you might have panic sold during the significant plummet the stock had because you saw a 20% drop and might assume it's options would go down much more significantly than it did.

If you try this out with something else like RKT, TLRY, or SPCE (again, I am NOT recommending this for a first timer, but giving you more affordable choices for your first time) then you can be harmed less by the significant volatility levels than you would with AMC.

If I were to make a personal recommendation, don't even do those. Learn options by starting with a less volatile stock that has low premiums so that you don't throw away $1200 dollars on untested guesswork."
2021-06-03 09:48:45,stocks,Yes. Your order will not fill because the ask price is higher than when you placed your order.
2021-06-03 02:48:30,stocks,Yup at least that's my understanding of it
2021-06-03 18:46:29,stocks,😂😂😂
2021-06-03 02:42:55,stocks,Yeah. Keep thinking about it the way u did in your original post. Just do the math based on your price target. Given any specific price target and date. You can always pick the option that maximizes your gain. For example if the stock is at 65 and u think it will reach 100 on Friday then compare your options. For example. If you can buy a 99 call for $5. You lose 4 dollars since it will only be worth $1 on Friday. If u can buy a 65 call for $20. U only make $15 since it will be worth $35 on Friday. $15 on a $20 investment does not double your money. Instead it might be best to buy an 80 call for $10. It will be worth $20 on Friday and you will double your money from $10 to $20
2021-06-03 03:59:39,stocks,"The ask price is your price per share. So yours are $12 a share. And yes it can happen again. And yes, just go into your contract and set your ask and sell it.

2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Advanced Options Questions, Can you Sell a Contract you don't own and How does it work? I know the entire part of how Calls/Puts works, essentially Calls giving you the right to buy a stock at a predetermined price, Puts giving you the right to sell the stock at a set price. You can execute the contract or sell the physically contract itself, they are bought/sold in group packages of 100 shares. 

A couple more advanced questions came up and maybe I'll number them for ease, if anyone more skilled was able to maybe help explain them, even part of it in any way, thanks so much btw!   

1. When I glance at my brokerage it looks like there are 4 options, what's the difference between Buy to Open, Buy to Close, Sell to Open, Sell to Close? I believe buy to open is the simple, buy the contract itself and sell to close to sell the contract you own. How would buy to close and sell to open work then? 

2. It looks likes there's a way I can sell a contract I don't even physically own, or at least seems like it's giving me the option too, how would that work? Is it essentially the equivalent of a short where you now have an infinite amount of downside you can lose, but can only make the amount you buy/sell the contract for?  

3. Each day the contract decreases overtime, if all other factors, like price were to stay the same, and it moves sideways. Is there a specific percentage or way to calculate how much less the contract is worth with each passing day or is it really random? Again assuming the stock price and everything else about it stays the same. 

4. I see it also gives me the options to buy the call/put options using 2/3/4 leg spreads, what exactly is a leg spread in this situation? 

I'm thinking about experimenting for education reasons, but figured I'd grab advice from others more experienced, and figured maybe others might like to know, since doesn't seem to be many resources explaining it and well in this depth, so huge thanks if anyone is about explain even part of it."
2021-06-03 00:50:16,stocks,"For calls, a buy to open will get you the option, after that you can either exercise the option or sell to close (sell off the option to someone else that is buying to open)…. A sell to open is when you give away your existing option (often a covered call on shares you own). If you want to buy your rights back you do that with a buy to close.  The 4 transactions are the buy/sell for getting an option and the buy/sell for giving an option"
2021-06-03 00:53:50,stocks,"Thanks for the explanation, so is it possible to sell to open if you don't physically own the option or do you have to buy it 1st to be able to sell to open?"
2021-06-03 01:01:03,stocks,"That depends on your broker and what kind of account you have.  If you sell an uncovered call, your risk is that you have to buy AT ANY PRICE if the person holding it exercises.  For example, if a stock is $5 and you think there is no way to go to $10, easy money, you sell 10 calls at $10, the price spikes to $20, you are forced to buy at $20  and the person who bought gives you $10, you just lost $10,000 (10 options, 100 shares per option, $10 loss per share) (excluding the value of the premium you made)"
2021-06-03 01:01:51,stocks,That’s called naked
2021-06-03 01:04:48,stocks,"It depends on which option you're doing. Selling to open an option on shares you don't outright own can be called selling a naked call. You can also sell to open an option as a poor man's covered call. This is known as a diagonal spread.

When selling a normal covered call you have to own the underlying 100 shares in case you get exercised.

I'm not sure about the other spreads."
2021-06-03 01:09:35,stocks,"Holy snap, I have Schwab and actually do think my account is set to Margin, I don't think I use it though. So is it essentially the options version of shorting a stock? So once you sell the contract to someone, do you have any power or does the person you sell too have total control if they want to exercise or buy/sell the contract back? Are you forced to return back the shares or can you just return back the contract itself?"
2021-06-03 01:13:56,stocks,"Cool thanks for the explanation, so is there really a purpose to sell to open an option, if you have to own the physical shares to sell/buy, since I figured the whole purpose of options is to leverage, so for example buy/sell without actually having to pay for the 100 shares of the stock. In this case, if you already have to own them, seems like you're better off buying the stock or shorting  it if you're truly confident it'll go down?"
2021-06-03 01:29:41,stocks,"Margin is usually always automatically used. That's what the accounts are for, to keep your money free for higher investments. Even if you wouldn't require margin it can still use margin.

That said, stay away from selling options. We are talking about limited risk (premium) vs unlimited risk. 

This needs to go wrong only once and if you don't know what to do you might be fucked. The way to get out is buying an equivalent which cross each other out, but if you can't afford that anymore then you are literally forced to buy at whatever price, putting you at an unlimited negative amount. 

Don't get me wrong, if you know what you are doing you can earn money with it, but I don't think it's ever worth the risk."
2021-06-03 01:18:43,stocks,"You’ll need to check with your broker how that is different from a cash account.  The actual thing that allows options trading is slightly different but certain levels of options trading might have to be done on a margin account.  As for selling an option, yes that gives the other person the option to buy at any time (regardless of the current price the stock is trading at) forcing you to deliver.  That often causes a taxable event too.  You might want to lookup some intro YouTube videos on options, it’s easier to learn when watching someone explain it in real time."
2021-06-03 01:22:08,stocks,"You can sell to open a put which can be a good strategy for stocks you would like to own at a specific price. Let's say Apple is selling for $130 and you think it is too expensive, but you think Apple at $125 is a good deal. You could sell a put at $125 strike price and if it hits then you buy the shares at $125 and collect the premium received for the option. If the price does not strike then you just collect the premium and can sell another put."
2021-06-03 01:38:07,stocks,"Yeah think I noticed all my trades were margin like for years since I started, even though I always had the amount of money to buy what I was interested in. I normally stay away from shorts, exactly since the risk side is infinite, so I assume selling to open options should be the same way. 

I assume buying the equivalent means to for example buy the other call/put version, in case it goes up/down. Isn't this a strategy to almost always win, say a stock is at $20, you buy at call at $21, and put at $19, then you can just exercise whichever one ends up correct, while letting the wrong one expire, or is there something more to it? 

I assume it's always safe to buy to open then sell to close though is that correct, since it means you can only lose the amount you put into buy the contract?"
2021-06-03 01:47:47,stocks,"By buying the equivalent I mean buying the exact opposite and it cancels out your short option. Some broker also just have a close button which does the same for you. That means you pay premium twice and also have to take the losses.

What you mention is what I call hedging but I'm sure that's the wrong word (I suck super badly at remembering how something is called). One scenario can be the one you are talking about, where you open positions close to each other for the opposite directions to minimize risk. It's not as great as it sounds, you pay premium twice and this is only effective if you have volatility given or expect volatility. In the first scenario premium will be very high. Then you have to determine a point to sell and hope that it then moves in the opposite direction. Once it moves far enough to equalize the premium you are good.

Usually you get a short dated option for the move that you expect soon to happen and a longer dated option for the reversal. 

Also, let's say I bet the price goes up and buy calls. Now it went up 10% and I want to keep my position open but market looks uncertain. NOW I buy puts equal in amount to my calls, so not right away but after it already moved. This is riskier because a part of the time wasn't covered, but if there is absolute reason to believe it goes up, then this is better to do."

I haven't really seen anyone commenting on it much, but it seems like with so much volatility you are likely to hit the strike price one way or the other before they expire, so investing in one or two of these options seems like somewhat of a no brainer.

Does anyone have any thoughts or experience doing something like that during these massive surges? I know there have only been a couple of days like this.

When price spike, IV will also increase thus increasing price of that option due to the fact the 'chance' for an option to be in the money increases. If you buy a call/put at 500%, your upside is very small and your downside is so huge, you'll lose regardless of any side when IV drops to 200-300% or lower (IV crush)."

NVDA is in a great place right now. Its retail product GPUs are in high demand, deep moat with AI research, and partnerships with key players like Tesla and Nintendo. The Arm acquisition might fall through, but if it goes through, that’ll be big. 

I’ve bought in at a DCA of $520, and the rise to $675 has been great. Got in way before earnings, and plan to hold past the split. I do hope it cools off slightly after the split, as I plan to run covered calls against 400 shares to supplement my income then wheel those 400 until IV crashes a bit."

The main thing for me is Jenssen Huang. Dude is a genius and puts great people around him. The leadership team here will continue to make the right decisions, and they put an emphasis on creating value to the shareholders.
The price and valuation are very high, but I believe they are justified. The expected earnings growth is phenomenal, and they ALWAYS beat expectations. Don’t use a lagging PE when talking about valuations, at least use PEG. 
Do yourself a favor, buy NVDA and hold it for a couple years. It is a volatile stock, so you will have to tough out some gut wrenching dips, but hang in there. This stock rewards shareholders."

Can it continue? Sure, AI/ML aren't going anywhere and AMD is going to have a heck of a time gaining traction there, plus Mellanox was a good buy.

That being said I also don't think they'll enjoy the same kind of GPU hegemony they have in the past with more credible competition from AMD and eventual increased competition from INTC as well. Nor do I think their automotive aspirations will succeed: their platform is too energy hungry."

2021-06-03 01:59:36,stocks,"1st you need to understand that this is a fanatical stock. The sentiment is dominated by gamers and crypto miners and if you are either, you know how they can be total zealots. Thats the biggest warning I can give you. Right now they are high on NVDA but the knife cuts both ways and if the tide turns, price will fall below reason as well.

See CD Projekt Red to see what happens when Gamer sentiment turns. They seem to believe that CDR is dead and all future games they make will fail. The price has been shredded despite the best financial year in their history, low PE (albeit cyclical), massive dividend, and re-alignment to make twice as many games going forward... But the sentiment is apocalyptic. They may as well had help make COVID in the Wuhan lab at this point given how people are talking about them. Which is perfect if you are a buyer now but not so much if you were in prior.

So back to NVDA, that is what you are facing. Crazy investors. Not bad folks, but just nuts. Can be a good thing if you take advantage of it but can also cut the other way.

Fundamentally NVDA in a good place business wise. But its not rainbows and unicorns. For one thing, they are currently heavily influenced by crypto mining. Whether you think thats good or bad is a matter of opinion. Im of the opinion that this is not good for business because if cryto goes away, they may well lose 50% of their rev... the risk is high.

The other issue is PC sales really havent gone anywhere in a while and there is a good chance that the move to streaming gaming will eat a huge portion of the gaming market especially consoles, down the road. I would imagine they (Sony, MS, NIN) are all eager to switch to cloud based streaming if they can to eliminate the high cost of consoles and charge monthly fees (and such). So just like how we switched from hard copies to downloads the last 10 years, we may be switching again to streaming in the future. This would be horrible for video cards.

Now I am not saying all the above will happen and maybe you dont plan to hold that long anyway. But that would be my bearish argument for a long hold. In the near term, they are obviously overpriced... that is unless you think that they can maintain 50%+ growth for the next 3-4 years or so."

2021-06-03 10:11:17,stocks,"Yes, but his comment sounded more like the very short term after the split. Also I dont know if they came out strong because of the split or if this would have happened anyways."
2021-06-03 09:26:55,stocks,"Shareholders on June 21st will receive 3 additional shares for every 1 they own and those shares will be distributed after market close on July 19th. Whatever the share price is on July 19th will be divided by 4 for the new share price on July 20th

NVIDIA isn't going anywhere. Could be a great way to increase ownership in a business that will continue to grow and dominate in rapidly expanding industries.

If you think the price is currently overvalued, wait for July 20th to buy. If you think the price will keep rising before July 19th, buy now so you won't pay more for the same # of shares on July 20th"
2021-06-03 14:38:10,stocks,"It may not be a day, but they're going to be up for sure. People will take some profits immediately after, but that won't last long."
2021-06-03 15:30:08,stocks,"Tis called inflation my dude. Goodluck getting away from that one, it's gonna wreck growth stocks this year."
2021-06-03 08:18:16,stocks,"20th

Stock split is why I can't see it hitting any noteworthy lows in the near future. Time to buy in was a few days back when split was announced. Sure price might dip a bit, but you are still going to be paying premium."
2021-06-03 00:30:42,stocks,"NVDA is a better growth story than AMD. Their QoQ and YoY results, along with fwd guidance paint that picture. Adding AMD would be a good hedge, but I think it's very difficult to say AMD>NVDA"
2021-06-03 00:59:08,stocks,Amd is catching ground on Intel but is still pretty far behind Nvidia. If the Arm deal goes through (which is probably a 50/50 but Jensen is still confident it'll go through) it'll be an even bigger behemoth. I hold and love both companies but slightly prefer Nvidia.
2021-06-03 02:26:00,stocks,"You made a bet, and now you gotta pay the bookie. This is why the buffets hold 20 years and ignore every movement in between. Zoom out enough, and the usual drops after earnings disappear. 

If you still believe (things changed, should you still believe?) eat the loss, get back in and don't touch. If I were you I'd invest in the guys who nvidia is a customer of. The chip makers! Nvidia sells out every gpu? Chip makers get paid for each and every one. Nvidia stops buying chips? No worries, Elon will buy every chip you have. Teslas disappear? No worries, washing machines want those chips desperately."
2021-06-03 11:24:30,stocks,"What happens to shares purchased after June 21 but before July 19? Since they aren't eligible for the stock dividend is their price still divided by 4? Won't affect me, just curious."
2021-06-03 08:48:40,stocks,So we still have some time until the split. I can actually see it going higher
2021-06-03 11:04:44,stocks,"Yea I agree with what you said, I even like NVDA slightly more as a **company** than AMD it's just that the valuation is so bloated that I can't invest in it."
2021-06-03 09:24:41,stocks,"I can too, but I can also see it dipping a bit after split. Seems risky.

If could be a few years till you hit break even."
2021-06-03 12:54:08,stocks,Completely fair
2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Placing market orders when market closed Let’s say I want to buy something at open, at market. Is there an advantage/ disadvantage to me putting the order in now vs. at open via Fidelity’s app? I know they can open sharply higher or lower…. So whether I push the trade button tonight or at open, what’s the difference?

Ridiculous question I know, thanks for helping a newbie out."
2021-06-02 22:56:14,stocks,Don't use market orders
2021-06-02 23:04:20,stocks,"10 dollar stock. you place a market order tonight. pre market the price rises to 11 bucks, and market opens you might pay 11."
2021-06-02 23:39:32,stocks,"Depends on if the stock has extended trading hours. Some trading pre market, some trade post, some do both. It also depends on your broker. Some brokers allow you to submit an order with extra conditions (submit for extended hours trading, submit at a certain time, submit at a certain price). 

When the order is placed it’ll go to your broker to route to whichever exchange is deemed best. If the security isn’t in its trading hours yet, it’ll sit there in a que with other orders. As soon as the security can trade, your order will be placed the way you deemed. Since you did a market order, you’re going to get your order filled very quickly BUT you’re going to get whatever price is shown on the graph (which is basically the average between the current Buy and Sell price). There’s pluses and minuses to this depending on your strategy."
2021-06-03 00:17:30,stocks,There is a good argument lately that buy just before close and sell at market open (not pre-market) is profitable due to bid up from intl. players. Also there is research to suggest buy on a Thursday and sell on a Tuesday is optimal.
2021-06-02 22:51:49,stocks,The only difference is that you can change your mind before placing the order.
2021-06-02 23:22:47,stocks,"Market orders do get filled before limit orders, but there’s not much that really make them better….

Edit: then again if I ever do put in a market order im watching like a hawk the 5 minutes before premarket ends. I have gotten in on some stocks at decent prices because algo sell off on news that was interpreted incorrectly"
2021-06-03 00:33:09,stocks,If you’re going to do this at least get up and check (or stay up until) premarket to get a trend idea. Sometimes I check premarket before I go to sleep and might place a buy or sell order. If it’s market though it’s only if I’m buying a handful. Usually I put a limit order and then maybe wake up early enough to check it before market opens. But this time of year it opens at 6:30 and I’m not a morning person 😂
2021-06-03 10:46:49,stocks,"Don’t do it, as bid/ask spreads are too high and cost you most likely return in the long run."
2021-06-02 22:51:38,stocks,Following!
2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Beware of what AMC shorts are holding! I understand that most people in this thread invest safely and aren't willing to risk their money on a risky play like a short squeeze.

However, I would recommend to everyone to at least acknowledge that a short squeeze is potentially happening, and could potentially continue to happen. What this means is you should be weary of which Hedge Funds are shorting AMC at the moment, AND WHAT THEIR LONG POSITIONS ARE.

If AMC or GME begin to cause Hedge Funds to get margin called and liquidated, we might be in for a flash crash of some of the biggest named stocks.

2021-06-03 04:02:25,stocks,What people don’t understand is that most of the funds mentioned above are market makers aka high frequency traders aka liquidity providers. They don’t care if the price goes up or down because they are delta neutral or close to it. They make money from the spread between the bid and ask. They don’t like volatility but rather a sideway moving market. You will fuck them a little bit sure but they will not have to liquidate shit. I really hate these uneducated tin foil hat posts

2021-06-02 22:47:39,stocks,"> I would recommend to everyone to at least acknowledge that a short squeeze is potentially happening

God damn the definiton short squeeze has lost all possible meaning.

That being said we would need more evidence that someone is getting caught with their pants off, as in not hedging their positions and have more money in there than they can actually afford.

short share availability and fee rate indicates that its not as crazy as some people make it out to be. People will probably open new short positions at the peaks all the time, as long as they are right in set amount of time, they will make their money.

It would definitely start being interesting if AMC just keeps doubling its stock price or stays sideways at the peak. If GME in January is any indicator, we can definitely consider everything if it doubles at least one more time, you don't get margin called or are forced to liquidate if the stock price just increased for few days, and even then as i said gotta know their positions in the AMC, maybe they are a complete speck in comparison to their financials.

I doubt that any of the big companies are going to flash crash enough for it to be worth waiting for, first of all there is going to be buyers, and second of all it will all amount to few % of decrease in stock for them best case scenario, if you happen to have spare money in sideways good for you, but for example selling your positions now and waiting for it will result in murphys law where you end up buying these companies back at higher prices."
2021-06-03 01:54:09,stocks,Very good post. I've been in AMC for 6 months. The amount of dd I've read and done. This has the potential to crash the whole market. I think over the last month this has been a planned event as all of these SEC/DTC rules have gone in place to keep the damage at a minimum but still....
2021-06-02 22:00:52,stocks,I feel like this is a win! Let the pricey stocks crash so the average investor can afford to get in. They will rebound. If you own stock in those companies you can sell now and buy back in later for a better price.

2021-06-03 07:37:50,stocks,"This post is kinda misleading. It doesn’t distinguish whether the “long” positions are actual securities or whether they are derivatives. In the case of Citadel Advisors, you show them having two positions in TSLA. That’s because Citadel has a *lot* of leverage and TSLA just so happens to be one of the option positions they hold. The reason there are 2 separate positions is because they own calls *and* puts. So to say this is what will tank is quite misleading. Although it may be like a grenade blast, even though you didn’t get hit you still die. Some of these may very well tank just because the general market is crashing."

I will continue to support these companies. 

I've always said I would always goto the movies because of it's the experience of going with family & friends. Remember the clapping and cheering of Marvel movies right as the movie started. Or when everyone is laughing at some funny scene. Love it and cannot get that experience at home w/ streaming service. 

Am a hold on a these companies as long with others not listed. Lets support our companies and can't wait to see what AMC/CNK to do with our contributions. Hopefully to make our movie experience even better!!!"
2021-06-03 11:41:57,stocks,Looks like we are having a pretty awesome AWESOME sale time to buy more
2021-06-03 12:17:23,stocks,I need some karma
2021-06-03 13:15:10,stocks,Buy Apple after crash got it.
2021-06-03 13:42:51,stocks,This might be a controversial post but I doubt the short interest is that high. Although it does make a appealing target to short now that it’s risen to insane levels
2021-06-03 15:04:16,stocks,Every time stocks like gme and amc run like they are currently it takes most other stocks lower. Its starting to get old. Imo amc is not moving higher due to reddit buyers/options surely hedge funds are playing this game as well.
2021-06-03 17:55:45,stocks,It’s very Shilly in here 🦍🍌🚀
2021-06-03 18:08:43,stocks,Im saving this for some friday day trading. Appreciate the info m'dawg.
2021-06-02 23:03:31,stocks,I saw my profile hit 5 digits and keep rising all day. I will hodl until the downward fall. If it ever comes...gme kept 60% of its value after the all time high. Hope we are as lucky also. All we fan do is hodl and help each other
2021-06-03 10:50:05,stocks,"Oh joy, meme stocks are now being plugged in the few subreddits which used to try to distance themselves from wsb"
2021-06-03 04:39:39,stocks,There's no squeeze because no one was fucking short. This isn't GME this is just mass fucking hysteria driven by the media. It will end very badly for longs.
2021-06-02 21:15:41,stocks,I like this
2021-06-02 21:18:37,stocks,That’s interesting 🧐
2021-06-02 23:28:41,stocks,"I'd love to get in Google or AMZN.

Question though, why they haven't closed their short when it was at $5 or $6?  or are these new shorts?"
2021-06-03 00:46:51,stocks,"Good post. I had this thought earlier today and liquidated a lot of my holdings and went short QQQ. I could be wrong, but I have cash to deploy when I see something I like and it's not a huge put position so I'm comfortable waiting to see how things play out."
2021-06-03 01:57:09,stocks,No wonder micheal burry is short on tesla
2021-06-03 02:25:17,stocks,"AMC short % was in the low 20s when this started (compare to GME's 140+% in Jan), what's there to squeeze? How is this more than just fomo?"
2021-06-03 02:43:59,stocks,"Tesla puts, got it"
2021-06-03 03:14:15,stocks,"Honestly it’s going to happen sooner or later so be prepared if you have positions in FAANG and other big names. Once they have to cover their short positions shits going to hit hard and fast

2021-06-03 03:22:02,stocks,Can someone explain what the game plan is to me like I'm five?
2021-06-03 05:50:53,stocks,I’ll take some amazon and Tesla at 3$ a share..
2021-06-03 12:18:02,stocks,"I'll be honest, I sold most of my AMCs today, only kept enough to be happy if a short squeeze ever happen AND I manage to sell at high price... I sold at more than 5.5 my entry price. Still hold a few, and I'll buy back if it goes back around 10-15$. Cause I think long terms (a year or two) it could be worth 30-40$"
2021-06-03 07:37:08,stocks,"Lol short squeeze?
1) AMC short interest is ~21%.
2) Yesterday’s volume was like 700m shares, their whole float is 500m, anyone who wanted to cover their shorts could have done so at any time 
3) The issued another 8m shares just a couple days ago
4) AMC’s value is currently $30B, roughly 2x what its ever been worth up to last week. 

5) this is no squeeze, you’re just getting played. The people you think are getting squeezed are laughing their asses off at the idea of selling retailers AMC at $50+

Sorry :/"
2021-06-03 00:43:29,stocks,"That’s the point. Crash them all to infinity. They have been crashing us all for decades and no one bats an eye, all they’ve got was a slap on the wrist an a bail out (2008). Screw them for not learning the lesson. Redistribution of wealth is a must. 🚀🌙💎✋🦍"
2021-06-02 21:54:31,stocks,Hopefully they unload SPY tomorrow

2021-06-03 01:02:14,stocks,"The squeeze potentially started??? 

I thought they were still borrowing shares."
2021-06-03 11:02:23,stocks,won't happen. AMC is smart enough to continue sell shares during all of this. That gives shorts an out which makes it harder to squeeze.
2021-06-03 12:17:06,stocks,Tinfoil hat shit. Great..might as well ruin all investing subs
2021-06-03 08:05:28,stocks,Meme stocks are just Ponzi schemes. That’s the only reason the price is increasing not because of shorts covering
2021-06-02 21:19:48,stocks,Ty sir
2021-06-02 23:21:49,stocks,cant wait for tesla to crash <3 hopefully it drops below 600 again!!
2021-06-02 23:54:13,stocks,What does this mean in layman's* terms lol?
2021-06-03 12:55:36,stocks,"At the risk of being called a shill, I don’t think this is remotely a risk or possibility whatsoever... the short interest is under 30% and citadel is literally the biggest and most profitable alternative asset manager in the world (not even to mention their huge market maker business segment). If you think citadel is at any risk of getting margin called off of a position with less than 30% short interest I think you’re living in a WSB fairytale 🤣 that being said I’m balls deep in BB and have GME & AMC calls way OTM for july so I’m in for it, just think it’s important to keep a realistic perspective"
2021-06-02 22:19:48,stocks,If I had positions in any companies that these hedge funds hold I’d be pulling tomorrow and dropping in amc and GME. I mean get out before drop and also speed up margin call since they would start losing collateral in those positions. Then once it has squoozen I’d by back in on margin to the positions they held then sell GME and amc on way down. Not financial advice just what I might be doing.
2021-06-03 02:57:09,stocks,"Guy's n Gal's... Go to Superstonk page and read.... A House of Cards 1,2 & 3 and Citadel Has No Clothes. Outstanding dd by an admin over there that will give you a great run down of all of this madness with  AMC/GME it's truly mind blowing..."
2021-06-03 00:27:29,stocks,When I said there will be a major crash months ago I was downvoted and laughed at. Now finally someone here is posting about what is going to happen. The people denying the upcoming market crash will be featured on r/agedlikemilk lol
2021-06-02 23:53:10,stocks,"So basically they might need to sell a shitload of Tesla to cover their shorts.

Lovely. Elon Musk is a douche that over promises on everything."

2021-06-03 00:18:05,stocks,"Can JP Morgan crash?? And if so the insurance is only good for up to 250,000$. So should people take their money out??"
2021-06-03 00:43:22,stocks,"This is what I'm looking for, hedge funds getting margin called and/or fire sales, if I time everything right buying the puts I'll make some good money."
2021-06-03 00:50:02,stocks,Interesting.
2021-06-03 00:57:50,stocks,it doesn't show shares shorted. I highly doubt they have naked short positions. The put options could be a hedge against their long positions so this information is not really useful. It's also very outdated.
2021-06-03 01:02:05,stocks,"This is smart thinking. I think it's also safe to assume that if they did have to liquidate those stocks that it would also confirm that there is in fact a short squeeze from a margin call occurring.

&#x200B;

However, it's also possible that they had cash to cover and didn't require a liquidation and simply chose to cover a losing position.

&#x200B;

I'm still very doubtful that a short squeeze occurred here though. The short interest wasn't that high. And how could they have shorted it that much that it popped up 600%? Doubtful."

All these long positions you mentioned (minus SPY) have been hammered since Feb under the guise of ""inflation fears""

2021-06-03 03:59:55,stocks,"Right, because how dare those poor poor Hedgies not be allowed to short feeble stocks out of their miserable existence. Thus potentially bankrupting companies. Maybe those newly unemployed should learn to code. All of my positions were green today. With a gain of 221% and over $12k. I hope those HF’s have to cover every single one of those naked shares.

2021-06-03 04:11:24,stocks,Good thinking. How can we compare the 'size' of what's happening until now with the januari short squeeze? In Januari we had a small sell off of Spy. Purely based on gut feeling I would say that it was rather a panic reaction and not significantly the effect of hedgefunds being margin called. I'd love to hear other thoughts.

Give r/superstonk a chance if you like and read the research available (go to 'About' section and find the 'DD'). 

Hedgefunds and their very wealthy investors are in over their heads. They have been manipulating the stock market for too long. They bet on businesses going bankrupt, but GameStop has turned itself around as a company and will continue to prosper. They have shorted this ticker to oblivion, which means this short squeeze will go very high. The media has been keeping it hush hush for obvious reasons.

But don't take it from me, but have a listen to journalists and industry professionals who explain it very well in AMAs done at Superstonk (you can find those on YouTube)."

You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions, however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, including those who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemble a commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day’s supply.”

2021-06-02 21:31:14,stocks,Basically Tech is gonna get ass blasted if they're forced to cover.
2021-06-03 06:45:52,stocks,"Yes. This is what we saw recently with Archegos. When the HF's short positions become EXTREMELY red (as in negative values greater than the total value of other positions), the banks/brokers that lent the HF the shares can FORCE the HF to liquidate all of their other positions in order to close the short position. For example, if Susquehanna was forced to close their SPY position (\~84M shares) while the 10 day average volume for SPY is 63M shares, SPY (and all of the stocks that make it up) are going to TANK. This will likely trigger panic selling elsewhere, putting the entire market into a crash. As the prices crash, the value of the long positions goes down, meaning the HFs will need to close more positions to cover their shorts. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Now, anyone with any cash on hand will be sitting pretty to capitalize on such a crash, as the fundamentals of SPY won't have changed, and it will recover eventually. But short term, things could get WILD.

&#x200B;

TLDR: BTFD"
2021-06-03 01:21:57,stocks,"Yes, they will be force liquidated if GME/AMC keeps going up."

2021-06-03 16:56:38,stocks,"Hedgies over-shorted AMC, GME and a few others. They won't have the liquidity to buy back the shares during the potential squeeze. When they get margin called and have to pay up, their other holdings will be liquidated to cover their losses.

AMC and GME will moonshot briefly while anything the hedgies bought long will see a flash crash from their assets being sold off suddenly.

Unlikely to be long lasting by any means, but seems likely to be a significant short term bump. SO - if you're looking to invest long term right now, I'd wait out this squeeze to see what happens then jump during the flash crash when everything is on sale."

2021-06-03 01:36:32,stocks,"Some of them absolutely have. But the running theory is the biggest hedge funds created synthetic shares to short, effectively making counterfeit stocks. Banking in the company going bankrupt and never having to pony those fake shares. Now it's not only sticking around, it's SOARING, and the hedges have to pay ""rent"" to keep those fake shares from being called out. But at a certain point the clearing house(broker for the broker) will say enough is enough and demand enough money to cover the hedge debt. That is called a margin call and the hedge will be forced to sell other holdings to cover."
2021-06-03 01:56:06,stocks,"A. You pointed it out- no ethic. And this is what the whole premise of this squeeze is, that they haven’t covered and unethically over-leveraged themselves by shorting these stocks beyond legal short positions. And B. Retail does not move a stock up 100% in day on 750m+ volume. If you look at these stocks, you can see there’s something funky going on, it’s not normal. Someone is trying to fight it, and they wouldn’t fight it if they covered and weren’t short beyond belief."
2021-06-03 01:39:22,stocks,"I agree with you, the fact that these stocks mentioned by OP isn't crashing is a pretty clear sign to me that the hedgefunds are not being squeezed"

2021-06-03 11:44:15,stocks,"Valid point and this is important to consider and discuss, but with this assertion you would need to provide a *when* as well. It’s entirely possible they “closed some short positions”, sure. 

But from my uneducated perspective, that does not at all seem equal to “short positions are closed, they’ve now went long to make money alongside retail…” 

Without short positions, how would AMC go from 30 to 66 in 24 hours just yesterday?"
2021-06-03 14:03:09,stocks,there is so much DD out there that is trying to answer this question as objectively as possible.

2021-06-03 12:10:54,stocks,"I haven't looked into the specifics of their trade, but generally it's a hedge. For example you can buy shares (long) then sell a call (short). A naked short call position has limitless downside risk. But if you cover with the long, then you limit your risk.

Also, a few people have noted that some in this lost are market makers. So they will be long and short because they are not trying to make money from their positions. They need shares available to provide for market demand. They will offset their long holdings with short positions to be as close to neutral as possible. They'll typically rebalance daily, if I'm remembering correctly.

And as one more example from the options world, you can buy a put and buy a call. That puts you in a position where you profit if there is an extreme swing in either direction for the underlying asset. That strategy is a long straddle. It's a strong strategy if you expect increased price volatility but don't have a strong prediction about which direction it will go."

2021-06-03 00:08:23,stocks,"There is an Infinite downside to a short position. 

People that bought GME before January would have been happy with 500$, if the trading wasn’t halted by Robinhood and other brokerages. after that happened, THEN the large majority of investors came onboard. 

There are still folks who only own two shares (at 350-400 each) and there are people who kept right on buying down to 40$/share them up to 140. Down to 80 up to 260, down to 140 up to nearly 300. 

 By now, most of the apes who originally thought this would take a week are ready for ungodly numbers, or bust.

Partly because these hedgies will be fukt and have to sell everything,  but also because people have been saying this since January, that GME mooning will crash the market,  therefore people will panic sell and you get a self fulfilling prophecy.

In theory if the losses are big enough, a bank can go bankrupt. The FDIC insures your checking/savings for up to $250k per depositor.

In this sense, if you have say $2M in cash on hand, it would probably be best practice to spread that out between 8 different banks ($250k each bank).

That being said, I think there is a low chance that JP Morgan goes out of business."

2021-06-03 04:20:38,stocks,"Correct, Burry is a smart cookie. He most likely noticed the hedge funders short positions in all kinds of meme stocks and other dumb stuff. Then realized that the thread connecting them was that they were all heavily invested in TSLA. This would explain his massive bet against TSLA. Not the fact that he dislikes Elon Musk or Tesla, Space X, etc as a company. Never bet against Burry, ever. Remember… this is the guy who spotted the short positions and resulting squeeze in GME, a whole 4 months before RoaringKitty did.

2021-06-03 04:05:08,stocks,"Hedge funds currently have negative shares of amc and gme (google what shorting is if you have to).

AMC has traded *billions* of shares in the past few days, it's not like the shares to cover aren't available.

This is where the whole ""shorts haven't covered"" thesis falls apart for me. I can accept that hedge funds are evil and greedy. I won't accept that they're stupid, at least stupid enough to understand what's happening and abandon any attempt at self-preservation."

Fool me once, fool me can’t get fooled again, etc. 

Remember, this is *what they do*, and they have access to resources (not to mention capital) far beyond what you or I have. It’s not like they’re checking Robinhood on their lunch break to find that suddenly their shorts have moved against them 5x.

If I were a hedge fund, I like to think I’d see the writing on the wall, close my shorts, hop aboard the long train for some big profits as it rides up, and continue to open new shorts as the price skyrockets so I can make money all the way down, too.

You seem to be focusing on the moral implications of the word “ethic.” A lack of defining ethic to their choices — other than profit — is not in any way a case  against their intelligence. If anything, it’s an asset. Honestly, my implication is that many retail traders are adhering to an ethic (“fuck the evil hedgie’s! power to the people, they’ll wrong us no more!”) is leading to irrational decision making that can potentially end in big losses. Hedge funds do evil shit, but they aren’t driven by evil, they’re driven by profit. What gets them that profit (going long, going short, giving blowies in a back alley) is a moot point. 

B. You’re probably right. My guess? Hedge funds going long to profit off of the run up. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that there are “sides” in this game. Hedge funds will switch from long to short and back to long the moment they see more potential for profit by reversing their position. The *ethic* that long = right and short = wrong is exactly why there are retail investors sitting on 30%+ losses from a position they opened within the last 24 hours.

Edit: clarity"
2021-06-03 12:25:20,stocks,"This is a good takeaway, and a good guiding principle for trading/investing in general. 

The dangerous takeaway (and one that I saw reiterated in the comments), in my mind, is that you should sell off things like SPY or AAPL and pour into meme stocks with the expectation that the memes will continue to run, the big names will rank, and you can perfectly time and execute all of those position changes. As the events of this morning have shown, that would not have panned out well."
2021-06-03 12:33:13,stocks,"Entirely possible they still have some short positions open. Also entirely possible they had to cover some yesterday. What’s likely — and this is as much a guess as anything else posted here, but is based on the premise that hedge funds aren’t inept at their job — they’ve closed some, opened some long positions, and opened new short position as the price continued to sky rocket. A short opened at $70+ (on a stock that, mind you, is now sitting around $50, and reached below $40 this morning) has FAR more potential value than one that they opened months ago at $10 or $15. I would think it would be in their best interest to take advantage of this profit potential.  

And my guess is that a combination of HFs closing some shorts, opening new longs, and retail investors piling in, all contributed to the massive run up of the last couple days. 

Again, just guesses, but I would wager them as better guesses than “HFs are sitting on the sidelines passively watching their positions crumble.”"

Unless we have a man on the inside? 

If I’m wrong and the SEC is now releasing daily short reports or the hedge funds have started tweeting their positions, I’m all eyes and ears.

Buying and accumulating more of it. You only need it to go up when you stop buying/need to cash out. Until then you're happy if it's an eternal dip.

Yes, while one man does in fact have a large following and a lot of influence, it is impossible for one man to have been the catalyst for a MARKET-WIDE crypto crash and burn that ripped over $1T with a T out of the crypto market.

Especially when the prior Doge endorsements and memeing he did, didn't affect the price of almost every crypto on the market, and didn't even rocket Doge that much (in comparison to the massive tank we saw, again, in almost every crypto in existence.)

In conclusion, I think Elon just caught himself up in the eye of the storm as the hurricane formed around him. Yes he has a lot of influence, but even with a following like his, markets aren't moving this drastically from 1 billionaire tweeting about Doge. Just doesn't make sense.

In this case, he doesn’t want to help the shorts who are long on his company because this will destroy its price. I speculate he also probably double screwed them over inadvertently when he opened his mouth about BTC which is where they probably held a lot of their cash reserves, causing them to start pulling out of it and causing the flash crash from few weeks back. Again, I speculate."

2021-06-03 16:23:52,stocks,"Do your research.  Find the dividends that actually return 6% (which is very doable) and you will live comfortably.  

The basic formula to get you started is your expected yearly income (we will call that E)  the interest rate return of the dividend (we will call that I) and the total amount of what you would need in dividends to sustain that income (we will call that T)

E / I = T

$100,000 / 0.05 = $2,000,000

That is a modest 5% dividend fund.  Find yourself at least 5 of those funds and spread your investment over them.

You can also reverse the formula to figure a rough estimate of what your return could be.

T \* I = E

$2,000,000 \* 0.07 = $140,000

I am not sure of what kind of income you believe you have to have for your lifestyle but I can surely manage on $100,000 - $140,000 easily.

2021-06-03 17:53:17,stocks,"Oy.

Look. Hedge funds don't ""get revenge"". They're companies with investors who demand results and accountability for the decisions made by the people who control them.

They exist for the sole purpose of making money. They don't have feelings. They don't trade based on emotions. Most of their strategies and trades are created based solely on analysis of data generated by top minds in finance and economics, then implemented by computers, not people. They have unimaginable resources in comparison to retail traders and the ability to do things retail traders can't (like sell big blocks of shares off market).

This isn't a tv show plot. There is no big, bad evil dude trying to screw the little guy. It's greedy fucks being greedy fucks because that's what they're paid to do. 

A small group of people popularized the idea of a short squeeze play in these stocks. Others saw the viability of their strategy and got on board. Hype took off. Media makes a frenzy of fad buying. Big institutional investors got involved and took it to a while new level.

Some of those guys got burned, yes. Just like some retail Investors got burned. But a lot of funds and banks made (and continue to make) a metric fuck ton of money.

Today, they ran up prices in the pre-market when most retailers don't trade, then dumped at open when there were massive market buy orders from people who don't know what they're doing. Then the stock dropped which then let them get rid of their shorts at a discount.

Here's an example:

Say they got short positions at $40, then they run the stock up with long positions until the price is near $80 (which requires very little volume if done after hours). At market open, they sell those long positions, they now have made enough profit to cover shorts without a loss when the stock goes back down to $40.

A lot of the first run up of GME went like this: dump shares in the aftermarket/premarket. People wake up and see the stock seems to have dropped a ton in an instant (because a lot of people don't even know about after/pre market trading), they freak out, dump their stocks. Price plummets. Hedge funds cover their shorts cheap, then buy long positions and run the stock price up and sell en masse. Rinse and repeat. 

The own shares. The own shorts. They own calls. They own puts.

They get paid when it goes up and paid when it goes down."

There is a chance some small funds will blow up but for something systemic to hit a large firm will have to fall. In my opinion that wont happen, i will explain my reasoning. 

AMC isnt co-operating for the creation of the squeeze. They put nearly 15 million shares in the market within two days at 50 dollars a piece. Why wont they just keep doing this when the stock goes even higher.

A firm like citadel would, if in distress, be able to get tens of billions in loans from banks or even the government or fed. They make too much money when times are good and contamination wont be risked. Citadel is also too instrumental to the health of market liquidity. 

The banks wont fail due to a drop in market exposure since 08' and far greater capital requirements

Facts should be treated as facts, theories as theories. The fact-theory soup is a dangerous space to operate from. 

Without a doubt, some hedge funds lost BIG on the GameStop events in January, but let’s not forget that, for example, Senvest Management made $700mil on GameStop, and I’m sure other funds did, too.

but OP wasnt talking about options - i mean he did mention it, but his strategy did not make any sense conceptually speaking. if you understand what shorting is, you’d instantly understand that his example makes 0 sense. how can you simultaneously short and buy a stock or a single options contract? what does that even mean?  the only way to interpret that would be to not even have a position on it meaning your capital wouldnt be influenced by the price action of the underlying."

My bigger issue, though, is that I'm not sure I understand the details of such a fund. Most high-yield dividend stocks in recent years have also stagnated, or fell—if nothing else, with respect to the S&P. 

So if you have 2M+, why not just shove everything in VOO, get your annualized 9% return—which becomes about 6% after capital gains, depending on where you live—and live off that?

Don't get me wrong; I respect dividends for what they are. But If you have that much capital to begin with, you probably don't live in a place where you'll be able to sustain yourself comfortably."

That 10 mil a share just wont happen, gme and amc would just sell shares to bolster their balance sheet. They are both distressed, cash strapped companies. They wont let that opportunity slide just to fuck with some hedge funds. It would also require a million asset owners to not get greedy and to stick to the plan. 

A new recession would be horrible for the normal people as much as the financial sector. Its just far less likely to happen. There is a tremendous amount of liquidity in the market.

2021-06-02 20:36:49,stocks,"Roughly:

Calls are a bet a stock price goes up. You choose a price and pay for the bet. If the price doesn’t go above the price you chose before the bet expires, you lose how much you paid for the bet. If the price goes higher, you start getting a payout, which increases as the price goes higher. This is because the call also gives you the right to buy the underlying stock at the price point you bet on, so as the price goes higher and higher the holder of the betting ticket (the call) gets a bigger payout from pocketing the difference.

Puts work the other way. You bet prices will go down. If they go below the price you bet on, the same thing occurs.

You can be on either side of the bet. For calls, if you were making the bet (buying the call), then technically the maths means your gains could be infinite (if the price goes to infinity), while your loss is just the initial bet you put down. If you’re on the other side of the call bet (selling the call), you get to keep the money the buyer put down, but if the price keeps going up your losses could (technically) be infinite as you’ll need to pay out at some point.

If you buy a put, your max loss is the cash you pay to buy the bet. Your max gain is the difference between the price you chose and zero (simplistically). On the other side, similar to the person selling a call, the person selling the put pockets the down payment, but could lose a maximum of the difference between the chosen price for the bet and zero if things go really badly.

I’ve glossed over the complexities here but that’s hopefully the bare bones of how it works. Inviting others to point out any errors in the analogy.

Edit: use cases - puts are often used to protect yourself against down moves. You don’t want to sell your shares but you don’t want to take some or all of the capital losses from your shares if the market goes down. A put is like insurance and the gains on the value of the put from prices going down offset losses in the value of your shares. Yes you lose the down payment you bought the puts with, but that’s the cost of insurance. Calls can be used to gain exposure to the underlying stock in the case where you don’t actually want to own it (maybe you spot a very quick opportunity to take advantage of and don’t want the hassle of stock ownership). Or they could be used as leverage - doubling down on a stock you own because you are convinced the price could go higher.

Note that because these are effectively bets, they could be applied to anything. Stocks are most common, but also indexes, commodities, etc."

You want the expiry in a year, rather than one day, which gives you a higher chance of being in the money? That’ll be double.

You could if you wanted buy a call option at $9 when the price is at $10, but you would be paying high premiums for this and it would likely cancel out your existing gain and possibly then some"
2021-06-02 23:41:37,stocks,"Market makers in options are basically large hedge funds, traders, brokers, investment bankers, etc.

The market on which options are traded is completely separate from the stock market.

The CBOE is the largest options market. It matches buyers and sellers. It's a lot like the stock markets in that market makers post open quotes at what they estimate to be the proper bid and ask prices, and other traders can take those prices or quote their own.

When an option holder wants to exercise, they tell their broker and their broker tells the OCC, which runs an algorithm to decide to whom goes the honor of being assigned. I.e., it's not likely to be the same counterparty who wrote the contract. It can be anyone short those options.

Market makers make their money on the bid-ask spread, but also by very carefully calculating the implied volatility and setting the bid-ask to straddle it."

2021-06-03 17:19:09,stocks,"The problem you have with this is the Chinese government never sanctioned these ADR's and have always stated that foreigners cant buy Chinese stock. In other words, they wouldnt be betraying anything by canceling these ADRs. The blame will fall entirely on the ones who created them, not the CCP.

I am not saying this will happen but I have a feeling we are indeed being set up for it.

1st globalization is not always a good thing. I would say that it really a wash for developed countries. Its a boom for developing countries. Its probably a bad thing for us because it raised prices for those within the country making it harder for them to buy things, most notably, real estate. I actually think that foreign investors should be 100% banned from residential real estate or anything fundamental to living in the USA like agriculture land ownership, utilities, and water ownership. Im ok with other stuff but there needs to be limits.

2nd, the idea that stocks control business is false. They do not. The underlying businesses will be perfectly fine even if all stocks collapse to $0 today. What would happen is they lose access to selling shares to raise money. But that is all. No one is going to stop buying from Alibaba because the stock is gone. No one will stop manufacturing in china because the manufacturers stock is gone.

3rd, the folks who own businesses will be at a huge advantage if stocks collapse because they can now buy their own shares at a huge discount. The rich will become much much richer with a stock market collapse just as they do here in the USA on every crash.

Last, this is one hell of a weapon to use.

Unlike the USA, China is not driven by the finance sector. They are a productivity 1st country. A collapse for us would hurt a lot of jobs in finance. We are 80% ""service"" while they are just 50%. Not all service is finance but you see the problem here. This would hurt us a lot more than it hurts them. On top of that, we are a free speech country while they can control the narrative any way they want within China.

Again I am not saying this will happen. Just that it will not result in the collapse of China's economy. Not even in the least. In fact, it might actually help their economy in the long run and the perception will not be that China lied, it will be that a few fraudsters made Caymen companies to defraud the world despite Chinese law and a bunch of fools bought into the fraud while knowing full well that they cant own Chinese companies.

For me personally, I just dont see the point to playing into something that is in the grey. There are other places to invest."
2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Stockloan Shorting question Relatively new to shorting, so running a few experiments on what I consider to be the true losers.

So today I tried to short 25 shares of something that is around $8 (will likely go back to $6 in a week or 2), and got hit with the rejected notice.

Is there ever a situation where shares won't be loaned because it's TOO FEW ASKED FOR, or is it always purely a matter of none to loan?"
2021-06-02 20:37:51,stocks,"Yes, set up for it. Already completed one short."
2021-06-02 20:38:27,stocks,I am set up for it. One has already been done.
2021-06-02 20:04:50,stocks,"I'm still trying to understand the exact calculations, but it would be somewhere from .07-.15c daily for me to hold this.

If $8 goes to back to $6 in 3 weeks, I made $50 minus $1 or $2.

Trying to understand your writing. **So it IS possible that they didn't want to loan out such a small amount?**

If I had requested to borrow 1,000 shares, the order may have been filled?"
2021-06-02 23:26:39,stocks,"if its 0.07 to 0.15 cents daily on 200, thats about 0.1*365/200, which is about 18% yearly borrow rate. That's definitely a hard to borrow stock, so you aren't getting filled because there aren't shares left to borrow. You can also check, on iborrowdesk.com, which follows IBKR. All the discount brokers are similar and actually mostly use the same pool of shares available, so you can check IBKR's rates and it will somewhat match what you can get."
2021-06-03 00:10:28,stocks,"Sorry, that was a goof. The .07 -.15 is for TCS (not the ticker I got rejected from -- I can't even list it here or the auto-mod kills it). I still can't get straight answers from TD, though the page says 9.5%.

If TCS was 20 for $270, then the TCS daily borrow should be .07, right ?

If that formula and percent is correct, then the other stock at 25 for $200, should be .05c daily.

Is that all right ?"
2021-06-03 00:20:41,stocks,"I am not really sure where you're getting 9.5% from, but TCS (the container store?) according to iborrowdesk has a borrow rate of less than 1%, on TD (TD ameritrade?) this should be about the same or lower (0%), since it's so low, and you might be able to short it for free. Every stock has their own borrow rate so the other stock borrow rate can be completely different and can also change every day. If you are using TD ameritrade, your hard to borrow fees are shown to you daily."
2021-06-03 00:32:15,stocks,"Is there a good resource to learn the rates? TD is crap, and I cannot find any good tutorials/detailed charts on YouTube or elsewhere...

$270 of Container Store was shorted at 13.50.

Was aiming at K\*\*\*k also (former king of photography). Trying to short 25 shares of $8. Couldn't get it to fill - rejected."
2021-06-03 00:36:59,stocks,"Like I mentioned, iborrowdesk.com would be generally the quickest but not the most accurate for super hard to borrow stocks, if you can't see the rates on your broker. TD is annoying because you would have to call their hard to borrow desk to know the rates. If you have schwab or Fidelity they show the rates when you make a trade. There is no point ""learning"" the rates because the rates can change every day."
2021-06-03 00:45:22,stocks,"I also use TD and I would suggest you call them and ask for the hard to borrow desk. If you didn't know TD actually has 2 different types of account for shorting, easy-to-borrow and hard-to-borrow. If you have margin you can short anything that is easy-to-borrow, which includes TCS. KO*DK is hard-to-borrow but there should be shares available. You will need to call them and ask them to make the hard-to-borrow stocks available for you."
2021-06-03 01:10:42,stocks,"Ok, then this:

How do you see in your account where your fees/interest to borrow is? Is there any way to measure it cumulatively on TD?

None of these are intended to be long-term shorts (less than 1 month), until we see The Fed really fk this country; then I will forget I own them, and ride gravy.

I'm angling to spend $1 - $10 in interest/fees for the duration of each, but I would hesitate if that were substantially higher."
2021-06-03 01:22:41,stocks,"If you have any hard to borrow fees accumulated, it would be shown in the message center, they send you a report every day. If you haven't seen any you probably were not charged any fees but I would  call them to make sure."

Completely different game than long. 

I'm only pissed it took me this many years to do it !"
2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Overpaying for Stocks Today was my first day with day trading, and I had a weird problem: Every time I purchased a stock with a trailing stop loss order, the system purchased the stock for more than its actual value. I can't figure out why. 

Example: I bought SPLP stocks for $29.31 per stock today, with a trailing stop loss order of 1%. Now that I'm reviewing how the stocks performed, I'm seeing that the stock never even hit that price point. 

Any advice for how to avoid that? My hope was that the trailing stop loss order would let me purchase the stock at its current price, and then automatically sell it off if it falls more than 1% after the purchase. But in this case, I ended up buying stocks for more than they were ever worth, and the trailing stop loss didn't do anything even if they fell more than -1% after purchase. Are you supposed to make limit purchases first and only afterwards add the trailing stop? 

(I'm on Webull, but I imagine this applies to any brokerage that offers trailing stop loss orders.)"
2021-06-02 20:08:17,stocks,"Learned that you always buy a ""limit"" order (not ""Market"" and you can actually change the amount you want to buy it for. Words of advice here though... If the price of the share has changed during the time it takes you to fill out that little form, it won't buy it until the share reaches that price. I think of it like this- you're asking to buy a share from someone for a certain price. The seller of that share is moooore than happy to sell one to you for a crappy price, if you're willing to buy it (they would make money.) Also, with TD Ameritrade, you can call the help desk and ask for a ""tour"" of their platform. Really handy!"
2021-06-03 07:12:56,stocks,"A 1% stop loss is essentially going to guarantee a 1% loss most of the time. Almost every trade you make, you will be down at one point in the near future. It only really makes sense to use stop losses if certain price action would change the reason you bought the stock."
2021-06-02 21:53:22,stocks,"After fixing the entry error.. why did you pick 1%?

Minimize the round trips using at least 2 x ATR  for your time range.

Remember: Commissions are free, transactions are expensive.  Taking a stop is expensive.  Paying bid/ask spread is expensive.  etc"
2021-06-03 00:03:06,stocks,"I finally figured it out, if anyone's following. You have to click ""sell"" before finalizing the order, so it's a trailing stop loss order instead of, I guess, whatever a trailing buy order would be. Wish I knew that a few hours ago haha."
2021-06-02 20:03:04,stocks,"I could be misunderstanding it. I'll try again tomorrow with small purchases, just to test the functions out. Dumb thing to say, but day trading is so much harder than it looks."
2021-06-02 22:17:22,stocks,"I was going after stocks that seemed likely to move past 1% anyway, so the trailing stop loss should have ended in a positive sale one way or another. But I messed something up to where I overpayed for the stock, and the trailing stop loss did nothing. Idk, maybe I just need to place a limit order and then put a trailing stop. Just thought I could be lazy and do it all in one click."
2021-06-03 00:00:33,stocks,Not a financial advisor and everyone likes to play the game different. But maybe try going long instead of day trading. If you invest in well established companies that have continued showing growth every year the stocks will only go up over time. Maybe not as exciting and and quick of money as day trading but a slow and steady safer road to success.
2021-06-03 07:23:05,stocks,"You do you Bro! But one little advice : Daytrading is for fuckin pros, people who do that Stuff for years. Of course you need to start at one point but easy ? Not even close to easy. This topic ist so complex and you need to understand and lern so many things to actually start profitable day trading . Idea sounds nicer than reality really is."
2021-06-03 00:02:44,stocks,"If you're entering at-market orders, you're paying whatever the current ask is. That's the upper number on the spread. You may also be paying commissions and fees, which could be included in your cost basis and make the entry price look bigger than the price of the stock.

If you enter a limit order, all the shares that fill your order have to be at that price or better."
2021-06-03 00:33:08,stocks,"This. You want a limit order not a trailing stop loss. Other consider it cheating but it bears repeating, when you buy at market value, you are going to pay more than what the actual market says it is at that moment."
2021-06-02 20:01:15,stocks,Haha. What do you recommend instead?
2021-06-02 20:50:05,stocks,"It's your choice really, but I avoid any ""broker"" that offers fractional shares.

The thing to remember is that brokers are really nothing more than [netting operations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netting.asp).  Think about that for a second in the context of fractional shares and you'll begin to see how that lets them play around with order flow."
2021-06-03 00:05:29,stocks,"They all do fractional shares (aka ""stock slices"") now.

You're buying those out of the broker's own holding. They don't bother the actual markets with that shit."

2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"The Weekly DD - Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Rise of The Gamers The video game industry has taken off since the pandemic and is expected to reach a value of \~**$290 billion by 2026**. How does this compare to the global box office industry? From 2019 to 2020 we saw revenues shift in the following:

**2019 -> 2020**

*Global Box Office*

\~42 billion (all-time-record) -> \~11.5 billion

*Gaming Industry*

\~152 billion -> \~164 billion

That’s right, in 2019 (pre-pandemic) the gaming industry was already over 3.5x the size of the box office entertainment industry and over 14x in 2020\*. Gaming’s 2020 growth outperformed the growth of both movies and sports combined.

&#x200B;

There is a shift in the ecosystem from gaming for fun to becoming more of a social event, ie: hanging with friends *while* playing video games for the hobbyist gamer, and streaming for the professionals. Gaming, once thought to be an activity for the young, has proliferated through all age groups and demographics. In 2020, 64% of all American adults (214.4 million people) played video games.

&#x200B;

Check out evolution of streaming platforms since the Pandemic. Out of the top 3 competitors (Twitch, Youtube, Facebook) Twitch was the clear winner here with users streaming and revenues jumping significantly. This massive expansion of total addressable market (TAM) is most likely a one time occurence, but the gaming industry is still expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11% moving forward.

**eSports**

Another beneficiary of the gaming industry boom, which is not talked about enough nor well-understood by many, are eSports. Essentially, eSports are gaming competitions that offer cash as prizes and draw YUGE crowds. The eSports industry alone is set to surpass \~1.1 billion in revenues in 2021, a 14% growth from 2020’s \~950 million. To put things in perspective some of the top eSports events compete with the US Open Tennis and US Open Golf tournaments where the winner takes home *millions* of dollars.

**Enters Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)? They are a designer and manufacturer of high-end gear for all things PC gaming. They offer four different segments of products, almost all of which have 5-star ratings on Amazon.

&#x200B;

1. PC peripherals: keyboards, headsets, mice, mousepads, chais, etc.
2. Streaming equipment: green screens, capture cards, microphones.
3. PC components: almost anything outside the graphics card that can be found inside the PC tower (the big metal box that the computer is made of).
4. Gaming PCs for those that don’t want to self-customize their own.

**Corsair - Outlook**

With the rise of gaming comes new opportunity for CRSR to expand its sales. In 2021, the PC gaming market was estimated to be $45.5B with \~50% of all gamers using a PC to play video games. This creates a very opportune market for those who can provide value to the PC gamer.

The target market who purchases peripherals are a passionate, well-researched group with access to many other brands. Therefore, only a well-liked (and popular) brand can succeed in this market. Thus, the market advantages large incumbents over smaller up-and-comers. Their brand value is also obvious in the premiums that their brand allows them to charge. Their gaming components and systems products, which they are currently the market leader, demands an average of \~40% premiums compared to their competitors! This means their products cost 40% more, on average, than their competitors and they are still out-selling them.

**Final Thoughts**

Given the rapid growth of the gaming industry boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, CRSR is on track to capture a large segment of this growth and expand its business as a result. However, CRSR is not expected to have any massive shifts in its business nor do their growth strategies include any drastic changes to their current strategy. Corsair is a premium brand with solid market penetration. Although they may not experience the same explosive from 2019 to 2020, they are in a great position to remain a market leader in a fast-growing industry.

**Positions**: None at this moment in time although I trade in an out of positions on this ticker frequently."

Considering a swing trade right now because volume is still rather low and there are no real catalysts/news right now that could justify a breakout imo. Only bullish signal might be that the price is currently higher than the EMA100!? Any other arguments/signs that speak for/against a breakout?"

2021-06-02 21:04:30,stocks,"Yeah I definitely agree, PC gaming has become a lot more popular in recent years. However, it has also gotten to be extremely expensive too. Hopefully the prices of GPU's and similar hardware calms down and gaming PC's become affordable again but I don't see that happening any time soon especially with the fact that NIVIDIA has raised its prices on its newest GPU's. Essentially, if these prices remain in the $1,000 price range I think it will drive more people towards consoles, but hopefully CRSR is thinking about that possible future and seeing that they are investing more money into streaming equipment/R&D I think they are at least somewhat prepared and able to weather this storm."

2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Is Shopify (SHOP) deserving of its current price? I have nothing against Shopify as a company. I think it’s a great business model and will continue to do well, but I’m struggling to understand this stock price.

At $1200+, you would think it’s been around for decades and established itself like an Amazon and Google. Its so hard to tell if the “future expectations” are baked into it or if this has plenty of room to grow.

Really just looking to spark a discussion on Shopify. I think it’s a great company, but the price puzzles me. Maybe I’m wrong and the price will continue to soar. Im open to any and all opinions on this."
2021-06-02 20:31:55,stocks,"The valuation of SHOP is driven by it's revenue growth.  The company has a five year annualized average revenue growth of 70.2%  Since the 4Q-2020 earnings announcement- about four months ago - the mean 2022 FY revenue projection has risen by about $700M.

Get that?  2022 revenue projects are \*RISING\* at an annual rate of 47%!  In other words, if the forecast keeps rising at that rate, by the end of 21, the 2022 projection will be up another $1.4B!!!  That's FREAKIN' MASSIVE REVENUE GROWTH.  

In reality it probably won't be that good because pandemic-related growth will probably slow.  If people expected it to keep going at that rate the stock price would be even higher.  Alot of stocks that benefited from the pandemic are in a holding pattern now because growth is expected to return to ""normal"" but people aren't sure what that will be."
2021-06-02 22:49:22,stocks,"The price right now is high but SHOP makes it very easy to set an ecommerce site. Yes, they charge about 3% on sales and a monthly fee (depending on plan) but they are the easiest ecommerce solution to use. 

WIX is not as good but cheaper (lower fee and whatnot).

The only other way to do it super cheap is if you go with wordpress and use the woocommerce plugins but you need to handle everything from server and other plugins (payment gateway) to make your site as good as Shopify. Doable but not for everyone.

There are many other solutions but, shopify is easier and faster.

And if you are a small business trying to sell your product, in the begining 3% is nothing. Rather have a site running now than have it all worked out in 2 weeks by someone else."
2021-06-02 21:59:31,stocks,It’s fairly valued IMO. I wouldn’t buy more here but wouldn’t sell either. I’ve been in e-commerce for years and SHOP is used extensively these days. A lot of larger companies are even shifting their existing e-commerce platforms to SHOP which was a trend that convinced me to invest quite early on. Perhaps it’s not as established as the tech giants but it’s about as established as a company can be in e-commerce and given how rapidly e-commerce is growing and how big the market already is SHOP probably deserves its multiple. That said I would expect growth to slow in the coming years and I doubt we’re going to see a repeat of last years stock appreciation anytime soon.
2021-06-02 23:48:40,stocks,If it’s a monster of a company and has no competitors than why would you say it’s overvalued? It’s stealing merchants from Amazon left and right.

Sounds like they established themselves as the top dog in their industry with low competition, but they will need to continue to improve and grow. Otherwise I could see Wix improving their interface and all to compete. That seems to be the only differentiator from my discussions on this so far. Appreciate the input"

Monthly.  In perpetuity.  Complete b.s. for a small business that needs to minimize it's monthly expenditures in order to make money.  Great for developers and Shopify, but there's no magic in any of it that any competitor couldn't do a better job in 3-5 areas and then people would be jumping ship.  I have been using/modifying e-commerce since SquirrelCart was amazing back in the early noughts, so not your average user, but srsly they are just building themselves up to be disrupted.

Its actually priced extremely cheap if you believe it can maintain its average growth and margins.  If it maintains its current growth and margins for 5 more yrs it will hit 50B rev and 20B profit, giving a valuation around 1T (20PS, 50 PE) currently a 6x return from today.

I've heard all the usual talking points in dealing with this; hindsight is 20-20, nobody can really predict in advance where the market's going to go, profits are profits, etc...but even with all of that in mind, I can't help but feel a world of hurt when I think of the additional money I could've brought in. When you’re looking at a nice return it’s a good feeling, but the idea of a phenomenal return as a distinct possibility only a day ago continues to linger in the background, and I don’t know how to get it out.

Keep in mind that this really only applies to meme stocks and some other high volatility assets; the rest (and overwhelming majority) of my portfolio is in long-term index funds, which obvi don't see the type of crazy volatility that I'm referring to barring times of economic downturn; the type of volatility that makes you wonder what if you'd held on for only a day or two longer. I'm sure at least some folks on this forum have gone through the same motions, so I wanted to ask if any of you had advice as to how to successfully put the regrets and the what ifs of selling a skyrocketing security too early out of your mind?

So for me it was low risk and small investment so I'm willing to hold out a bit. Also considering taxes being taken on short term investments"

It's kind of nice playing with the house money and if it goes way up, great. If not, I don't lose my initial investment. At the moment though I'm high enough over my initial that as long as I'm not late to the inevitable sell off I should be good to pull with even more profit."
2021-06-02 21:42:19,stocks,"Yup, I bought BB at the top-ish and got caught holding the bag. I lost 40-50% which is about -7k.

Over the course of the last few months since the initial selloff, I've been averaging down to sub 14. 

I saw my chance today to breakeven and don't care if it goes up to $20+. The feeling of no longer bagholding a 50+% loss is greater than any potential profits. It's better for my mental health and besides work has given me no time to monitor volatile stocks.

Once you baghold for years or months, the feeling of unloading is AMAZING. Guess I'm just risk adverse."

2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"My concerns about railroad stocks Recently, I saw a video on Vice about the issues with precision schedule railroading, a new trend that is meant to boost profits and efficiency for railroad companies.

The concern about this trend is that it has resulted in an increase in railroad derailments. This surge is caused by multiple factors as a part of this move to precision schedule railroading:

1. Inspectors have less time to inspect rail carts and even neglect to check some of them despite going over 35K miles (or even 90K miles) without inspection. Rail carts need to be inspected every 3,500 miles.

2. Workers are being overworked and underpaid and I worry it will cause more issues down the line

Please let me know what you think. I don’t see this as sustainable for the railroad industry. Thank you."
2021-06-02 23:21:04,stocks,"Hunter Harrison introduced his concept of precision railroading at CN about 20 years ago and it definitely puts stress on the operating crews and the fixed infrastructure and rolling stock.

The goal of this operating model is straightforward: maximize utilization of both people and assets, maximize efficiencies, improve the bottom line and make investors happy.  

There will be accidents that the public never hears about, accidents that endanger communities and strikes and labour unrest.  The industry is heavily regulated and the railroads will always operate around the fringes; they have large risk and legal departments to manage and deal with their violations.

But the returns for shareholders will be there.  Aside from any moral objections that an individual investor may have or broader macroeconomic factors that hurt the rail transport business, they will continue to be solid investments."
2021-06-02 21:02:21,stocks,The last thing you have to worry about is railroads.  They are not a government monopoly.  They are a monopoly by virtue of the massive cost that would be required to build a competitive business.

2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"SBBP - Strongbridge sold to Xeris I have recently started doing some individual investments outside of my 401k which goes into mutual funds. 

I only have 57 shares in this company, but I still want to understand what is happening. 

Strongbridge sold to Xeris and now E-Trade shows three different law firms are investing the company to see if they broke the law and whether they were fair to shareholders.

Here is the jist of the deal:

Strongbridge Biopharma plc (NASDAQ: SBBP) was sold to Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Under the terms of the merger, Strongbridge shareholders will receive 0.7840 shares of the combined company and 1 contingent value right (""CVR"") for each Strongbridge share that they own. The CVR is worth up to $1.00 in cash or stock of the combined company upon achievement of certain triggering events. 

Can someone explain what I am in for here in simpler terms? I am thinking about just closing minimal position."
2021-06-02 21:17:55,stocks,"I'm invested in XERS, so I can explain it. Assuming the merger goes through (which is very likely), every share you have in SBBP will become .784 shares of the new combined company under XERS. So if you have 57 shares in SBBP at the time of the merger, you'll wake up the next day with 0 shares of SBBP and 44.69 shares of XERS. I believe the CVR can't be fully achieved until 2024, so if you still own the shares at that point and every benchmark is met you would get an additional $57 in cash or $57 worth of shares in XERS.

Those law firms are the equivalent of ambulance chasers and claim they're ""investigating"" tons of stocks whenever news is announced that potentially caused the price to drop. It costs them almost nothing to announce the ""investigation"" and the vast majority lead nowhere. They should be ignored."
2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 2, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 2, 2021**

The three major indexes traded roughly flat in an otherwise action-packed day. The rally in the movie-theater company AMC went to another level, with the company gapping up more than 100% today (up roughly 255% in the week, 570% for the month). AMC now has a larger market cap (roughly $30 billion) than Gamestop (GME) ever did at the height of its rally. In other news, market participants continued digesting incoming economic data reports. 

The month-long battle between short-sellers and retail investors took another drastic turn, with AMC rocketing up, reaching as high as $72.62 and overtaking Gamestop (GME) in terms of market cap. This year has been nothing short of insane and vividly demonstrates the power retail investors are gaining. Shares of other so-called “meme stocks” that have risen in prominence on Reddit this year also gained on Wednesday. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) gained more than 60% while Naked Brand Group (NAKD) and BlackBerry (BB) were up 28% and 30%, respectively. Shares of Gamestop (GME) were up roughly 13%.

New economic reports showed more signs of disruptions in the supply chain. The Institute of Supply Management’s headline index of the manufacturing sector beat analyst estimates but showed production remains constrained by a rise in prices in key materials and labor shortages. The report found that companies and their suppliers “continue to struggle to meet increasing levels of demand”, noting that “record lead times, wide scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodity prices and difficulties in transportation products are continuing to affect all segments.” As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. The ISM's headline index registered a reading of 61.2 in May, an increase from April's reading of 60.7 and the 12th straight month the index has indicated expansion in the sector. Any reading for this index above 50 indicates the sector growing faster; readings below indicating contraction. 

However, it’s important to note that as the economy continues to reopen and the labor market improves, material constraints and supply chain are expected to be resolved. And as supply starts to meet demand, the rise in prices in key commodities and consumer goods is expected to slow down.  In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory and have expressed no desire to tighten monetary policy in the near-term. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Looking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper.

I remember when the jobs report was very bad in April (+260k jobs vs expected 1 million) but bulls went nuts because it meant that the fed wouldn't raise interest rates for corporations. I was very puzzled at first. Then later we had another jobs report in May where numbers were good, so the rates could go back up, but nope! Bulls took it as a positive sign.

2021-06-02 21:43:19,stocks,"Here are two other real costs:  shipping subsidies and conflict arbitration costs/customer service

They have buyer/seller protections, that can cause them to eat a loss - I have seem them refund the buyer and let the seller keep the cash when there are disputes.

They cut deals with USPS to provide $5 shipping (or close to it) for up to 5 lbs of stuff - the buyer pays that, and the seller gets simple shipping - as long as they print the usps label through poshmark.  Unsure if poshmark eats a loss on that or just has good deals with the post office.

The shipping is great for the customer and seller if they bundle items together because the shipping is the same as long as it is under 5 lbs.   encourages ‘filling up the cart’.

I think in the short term sales are slumping due to the USPS being slower lately and covid ending. People are gonna go out instead of shop.  All that will pass by fall.  Holiday season  - the ebay/poshmark/etsy platforms have been doing very well."

All this is anecdotal and/or gleaned from what my friend tells me about poshmark and reselling.  No clue as to how fairly valued it is at the moment.

Each of these online reselling platforms has to carve out a niche and protect it.  Beyond that the company that can keep fees lowest for the sellers, and has  the best search placement will be the most successful."

Right now they are valued at 5.5b which is criminal in my mind for the growth they are projecting but still we are talking about high multiples which scares some value investors.

If you think people are going to use there phones less post pandemic then maybe?  But that seems like saying electricity is a fad.  Also not guessing on 300% growth for the next year, that's what the company guided to and they have been sandbagging there guidance for the past two years.  Why would they lie about the numbers now?

Everything, gaming, streaming, food delivery, everything. We saw huge huge growth in some sectors so you guys extrapolate growth over last year into perpetuity and it looks amazing. Any argument against is again replied with, oh you think X will not be a thing after pandemic, stupid? Nobody stopped using internet after 2000 or buying real estate after 2008 but some stocks still got hammered. It's such a weak argument. One final thing, I'm not saying they are lying about their growth estimates. However, have you never heard about guidance revisions? Never heard about quarterly taget misses? Just because they estimated future growth to be certain % doesn't make it magically happen no matter what. And really you talking about it like it's the only company that does digital advertising. Far from it, this is cut throat saturated industry. It's full of listed competitors and there are even more unlisted ones. All that crap with pre installing apps, they did not invent it. Apps were preinstalled before they came to the market, they don't hold patent to that. Bypassing store to install apps? What like sending link to vendor landing page that has download button? Not that amazing to be honest. Not that they don't have tech, they do, but it's  not as amazing as you make it sound. Not only that but actual customers fucking hate services they provide.

I mainly trade fidelity IRA/HSA, but that would’ve pumped up my webull nicely and that’s an individual account i could’ve pulled from if and when needed... even after a 35% tax would still be a $4000 or so profit. I’m not sure it’s a stock you can hold a year for less taxes pay the tax man and take your gains or it’s gonna be $2 again."
2021-06-02 20:05:16,stocks,"I'm mad that last year when I wanted to invest in a theater company as a COVID recovery play, I chose to invest in Cinemark instead of AMC.

They were both undervalued because of the silly fear of theaters going extinct, but by all metrics, Cinemark was the much healthier theater company. Unfortunately, I didn't take into account that AMC would get all of the attention and have so much more meme power than Cinemark.

I still doubled my investment, but it could have been far more money if I would have listened to which one was chosen by Wall Street Bets instead of going for the healthier yet lesser known theater company. Sigh."

2021-06-02 21:55:51,stocks,"Always remember that when you sell, some poor sap is the one holding $70 AMC when it falls to $10 range. You could've been him but you're not. Move on."

2021-06-03 02:34:37,stocks,"I had 10k shares at 2.5 and sold at 3. AMC is a garbage company, and you did good selling for profit. keep to your fundamentals or you'll get eaten alive. Don't feel bad about missing gains on these lottery plays. Just be glad you didn't fomo and lose money. I only feel bad if I missed out on stocks I have high conviction about but  got FUD out of it."
2021-06-03 06:17:13,stocks,"thank you for this, i felt like shit too when i sold at 14. but I've learnt not to chase plays and no ragets"

2021-06-03 07:13:43,stocks,Did the same thing
2021-06-03 07:14:32,stocks,"Gain is gain. You had conviction that it would not go higher than 4-6$, and the market just proved you wrong. It's alright.

2021-06-03 09:49:43,stocks,"Yeah I had similar, I probably 1st heard about Bitcoin in the early 2010s, but at the time, everyone was convincing me it was for trading drugs or buying illegal merchandise lol, and it technically was, but I contemplated it, but then didn't buy, thinking I should just be a good person. My biggest fomo was probably Roku, starring at it during IPO, someone convinced me it was a basic TV company, so I stepped back. 

Thankfully I actually did buy AMD/NVDA/SHOP relatively early, especially SHOP, was probably my best purchase to date, since everyone told me to grab Amazon back then, but not having much money, decided SHOP was better, and stood by my word, since I also actually use SHOP as a service. 

That's wild you didn't even have $100 back in high school, I would've imagined most parents give allowances, or even money to their kids, even just to buy school lunch, and $100 is literally 1 paycheck, or even a fractioned of a paycheck for most people. Gotta be grateful then, for all the high schoolers we used to see, coming to class, with reasonable nice clothes. I was in my last year of high school in 2012, so we're probably even the same age too lol."

2021-06-02 21:15:38,stocks,there are 8x as many outstanding shares as gme. It would need 8x as much price action. Unlikely. Its already approaching the equivalent of gme’s high.

The problem with that is I’m not giving myself credits for the times where I held through red and the price rebounded. It goes both ways but we only feel the FOMO when we sell. 

Try not to get too hung up on people posting their gains. You have no idea how much they lost on their way to that point. They may be at a total net loss or even despite a huge payoff on their most recent stocks."

I’m definitely a newbie with this stuff but I can’t help but imagine that the hedge funds have to have a better plan after that GameStop disaster to deal with AMC stock right now.

That's not what's actually moving these stocks. Whales are buying them (i.e. the dreaded hedgies), algos are trading them, and hoards of retail investors chasing FOMO are buying them and that's what's causing the massive run up. Well that and a Gamma squeeze with so many people buying options. 

It also means that when the whales unload their shares the algos will start selling and the FOMO traders will bail, and the stocks will crash hard."
2021-06-03 13:52:42,stocks,"Very true

As important DD is needed, it is a test of your mental fortitude and keeping perspective. It is absolutely good fun to be on a meme stock, but there are always bag holders.

2021-06-03 00:25:31,stocks,"Yeah it’s just the option chains for amc is what’s driving it up rn. Sure the float isn’t what GME was, but at this point for most that HODL (myself included) we are speculating that there is some further manipulation. If naked shorts or synthetic shares were created then this can be huge. But aside from that there is still a bull thesis for another week or two on amc given all the contracts itm that are set to expire the soon and all the puts otm the same expiration date."

I saw a Call Buy this morning for AMC, and I said wow let's try this out. Thinking hey this is probably going to go up today.

I purchased the said call, and the brokerage sent me a confirmation email.
Now, it's 4 hours later, and the purchase is still pending.

I reached out to the brokerage and they said it's because the call wasn't filled as they don't guarantee execution. There wasn't an actual buyer/seller willing to trade at the specified price.

 How do they have a call available for purchase, without having someone actually selling that option?

What am I missing?

I'm a little upset as in the time writing this email just one option would have put me up about $4k."

Do you hold on market close or do you keep hold? And if willing, why?

2021-06-03 00:42:25,stocks,"Day traders get different margin (borrowing) rules as long as they maintain enough free cash in their account every night. If they hold stocks at close it reduces the cash they can use to qualify for the special treatment the next day, and can even cause a margin call,  even if they aren't borrowing any money on margin at close.

They also trade based on what they see as market sentiment, and their ability to react just as the market shifts is a key feature of daytrading methodology. The illiquid market, wide spreads, and increased chance of a big gap move that can happen in the off hours is a huge increase in risk that upsets the daytrading model. They would rather come back in in the morning and trade the latent dynamics of that gap."
2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,Can you have more than one type of contingent sale on a stock? I bought a stock thats doing well but I'm not sure I wanna keep it in the long run. Can I have it set up to sell if it falls and reachs a certain amount and have another to sell if it keeps going up and hits a certain amount or do I have to cancel the contingent sale and sell manually? I'm on etrade if that matters

2021-06-03 00:00:00,stocks,"The pretense of knowledge: my bear thesis. ***""The future is better foretold in the streets than in the morning news""***

One thing I'm exploring lately is how people on the ground tend to have a better read on things than ""experts"".  Obviously this is not always the case, and I think when it comes to things like Covid and stuff it's best just to follow the restrictions and what not.  But immunology is deeply rooted in science, and is easily testable.

I have a degree in economics, so I'm not one to sling the profession through the mud.  But I think that some economists are attempting to bring a degree to certainty to the field that simply is not realistic.  F.A. Hayek talked about this.  Economist William White, who predicted the '08 crash, also talked about this.  I'm not the only one saying it.

I recently read in a book, *The Shadow of the Wind,* by Carlos Ruis Zafón, a passage that struck me.  I will provide the original text in Spanish, for those who speak it, as his words are far more beautiful than my subpar translation:

*""Era un buen lector de la historia y sabía que el futuro se leía en las calles, las factorías y los cuarteles con más claridad que en la prensa de la mañana""*

*""He had a good read on the future, and he knew that the future was better foretold in the streets, in the factories, and in the troop quarters than in the morning news.""*

&#x200B;

**The '08 Crisis**

When the real estate bubble burst in '06, and the financial system came toppling down in '07-'08, economists and central bankers were left scratching their head.  They would eventually say that it was impossible to see this coming, but in the [Federal Crisis Inquiry Commission report](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf), they debunked this, and said that there was plenty of warning.

People on the ground at mortgage originator firms saw it coming.  Consumer advocacy groups saw it coming.  People at ratings agencies saw it coming.  But at all levels they were ignored.  There was an assumption that somehow, via technology and financial engineering, we had beaten the system and unlocked a new paradigm.

But Michael J. Burry saw it coming.  He was a bit of an outsider, and it's no surprise to me that he would be the one to take a wider look at things and say, ""wait a minute"".

Peter Schiff saw it coming.  I have mixed feelings about him, as he has strong (and oftentimes incorrect, IMO) political views.  But what I like about Schiff is that he doesn't pull any punches.  He didn't buy it when Bernanke said ""subprime is contained"".  A lot of people did.  The market did.

**2021 - Anecdotes from the ground**

My mom traded in her car yesterday and she told me she was surprised that the were willing to give her $11,000 for it.  It wasn't in bad condition, but this amount was surprisingly high to both of my parents.

She told me that a year or so ago they took the car into the shop because it was making a funny noise.  They paid a lot of money to have it checked out, but no problem or solution was found.  My mom mentioned this to the people at the dealership, and they even took it for a test drive.  No problem.  They were willing to give her the full $11,000, no more questions asked.

To me this looks like speculative behavior.  Used car prices are going through the roof due to, not only decreased supply, but more importantly to *increased demand*, with so much free money sloshing around in the system. And since prices keep going up and up, the dealers were eager to buy her car so that they could later flip it, regardless of the state it was in.  Sound familiar?

How about Warren Buffet saying he's seeing massive price increases all across the board?

What about the boom in that which shall not be named in this sub? Look at the meme stocks.  Look at Archegos.  Look at Tesla.  Speculation is running rampant right now.  Last night I heard Josh Brown on CNBC say ""let's not overcomplicate it, it's goin' north!""  Ie, the trend is up right now, so it's going to keep going up.  What in the world kind of analysis is that?

In addition, the S+P 500 hasn't had a serious downturn since 2008... remember, stocks always go up, right?  Covid doesn't count.  It barely scratched the market, and the rebound has been insane.

I follow a channel on YouTube called Everything Money (highly recommended, this sub won't let me link it).  The main analyst, Paul, has been investing since just before the dot-com bubble.  He knows that it's NOT normal for stocks to always go up.  This guy isn't an economist.  He's not a new investor.  He's not some pundit.  He's an investor who has been battle-tested.  He's a guy on the ground.  He knows this isn't normal.

&#x200B;

**The Stubbornness of Ineffective Paradigms**

In my own job as an English-as-a-foreign-language teacher, I have seen how many teachers stubbornly cling to ineffective methods that don't work.  I had one friend today tell me that ""this is coming from a place of ignorance, but I don't think their method of focusing on grammar works"". I told him, in this case, your ignorance is more insightful than their ""expert"" methodology.  He is correct, as my best students are those who do less grammar and have more exposure to real English.

It is the teachers who think they have to micromanage their students' learning who simply end up getting in the way.  We can't engineer the ability to speak a foreign language... all we can do is provide contact to it, and just like a baby learning their native tongue, eventually it starts happening.  Yet teachers cling to the false notion that it is through their deliberate efforts that students will learn.

And if such an ineffective paradigm can persist so stubbornly in this environment, why not in others?  How about the war on drugs?  Can we simply force people to stop taking drugs?  Does it make any sense?  No.  But people don't like to change their views - they cling to them.  And I believe economists, the Fed, and the market are clinging to the view that we can predict the market, and as long as we make the right adjustments (via QE and fiscal policy), we will be OK.

F.A. Hayek would call this ""the pretense of knowledge"".

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I don't know what's going to happen, and hey, I could be wrong.  Maybe stocks will always go up and we'll just avoid any major crises from here on out.  It could happen.

The issue is that the bulls and the central bankers never even seem to posit the idea that ""hey, I could be wrong"".  To them it's science.  Physics.  Math.  That's the economy; that's the market.

But the market is not science.  We can do our best to try and understand it, but IMO, part of having a true understanding of it is realizing that we will never be able to figure it out entirely, and then planning our policies in such a way that takes into account our limitations.

I'm predicting that this situation is not sustainable, and I'm predicting that we are going to see some sort of crisis in some ways comparable to 2008.  I believe that ultra-easy monetary policy and the resulting extraordinary levels of public and private debt are going to end up causing some sort of crisis.  I also believe that inflation will be a problem, and perhaps a serious one.

I'm not shorting anything because I recognize that I could be wrong.  I'm still learning and developing my theory every day.  But I am playing things very, very conservatively.

I am going to take the step to post this, because by taking a position I will either learn through being correct, or learn by being proven wrong.   The worst thing anyone can do is take no position at all and neither succeed nor fail at anything, and thus guarantee that they never learn or advance in any way whatsoever.

Good luck to everyone."
2021-06-02 22:09:28,stocks,"The Fed is not oblivious, but they cannot predict the future either. Burry himself said it (back when he was still tweeting) that the market is on a knife edge and can go either way.

Sustained inflation and higher rates may not happen, and the Fed may be legitimately worried about the deflation monster coming up after the ""transitory"" inflation. The bond market as a whole seems to price that in, if you look at yields."
2021-06-02 23:45:26,stocks,"On a comparative price to revenue basis,  the stock market is currently not extremely over priced - just a bit. I would expect 12 months  so of flatness. 

However, there is a massive crisis looming by 2025. This is due to one of  history's greatest technological transformations about to occur, across most industries - based on AI, biogenetics, batteries etc. *IF* this plays out then about 2/3rds of current firms (large & small) will be in trouble. About 1/3rds of firms will boom. If you pick the right firms its the investment chance of your lives. 

There will be massive social issues due to mass job displacement. For example - what say EVs take over as expected by 2026 or so. Based on current trends GM will go bankrupt, Ford may be half the size, Esso etc will be in trouble as will most garages, mechanics, engine oil suppliers, oil drillers, local cafes, equipment suppliers, etc etc. Tesla booms, wind power booms, nickel miners boom. A normal technological disruption but at a very rapid pace. As people lose jobs, other things spiral down. Repeat across medicine, health, banks, insurance, retail, etc. Social disruption, extreme wealth inequality, political consequences. Read the history of the early 1970's and multiply 4x."

Meanwhile, someone who invested today might see their equity balance drop back to today's levels (or a bit less or a bit more) and then recover (depending on the continued rise leading up to a crash).

Make no mistake - the market continues to go up. It doesn't do so in a straight line, but sitting on the sidelines waiting to time a bottom is a fool's errand.

I tend to agree with op. Although I look at it from a more macro scale, and my background is not economics so I come at it from a slightly different angle. 

Personally, I think the fundamental problem (as well as the biggest underlying issue that I think makes your thesis correct) is that we are running into resource constraints. The original thesis of the American market system (and capitalism) is constant, unending growth. It’s not physically possible, at least in our current carbon based, extractive system. And yes, that’s about as close to a scientifically “proven” fact as anything. 

There are too many people on this planet, at least considering the level of resource consumption of the western world (and to a rapidly increasing degree, the eastern world too). We are in the midst of a forced evolution, due to the climate crisis, complete with chaos and upheaval in the form of heatwaves, droughts, storms, fires, floods, and yes, pandemics. That’s not even mentioning the secondary effects of water wars, refugee crises, and the collapse of civil society— including the collapse of the rule of law, the insurance system (things become uninsurable), and authoritarianism rises. 

Leaving aside the climate science, “peak oil” is an accepted thesis even among the oil companies of the world. Yes, now there’s natural gas, but let’s not kid ourselves into thinking it’s limitless. We are seeing resource constraints for the minerals used to make solar panels, batteries, and other electronics. Lumbar, cement, and steel. 

The way I see this playing out differs depending on how optimistic and hopeful I’m feeling. Usually not very, unfortunately. But I don’t kid myself into thinking the “market” will just go away. There will continue to be winners and losers, even if the day to day game is punctuated by increasingly common, as well as severe, black swan events. 

I also believe that we, the ever more prevalent (and together, powerful) retail investors can put our money towards creating the future that we want to see. And in doing so, hopefully we also profit, and redouble our efforts to help people and the planet—and in turn, ourselves."

2021-06-03 02:40:18,stocks,That is you.
2021-06-03 01:01:03,stocks,"See, here's the thing though. There's a difference between trying to time the market through prognostication (i.e., assuming that a downturn is forthcoming) and simply refusing to buy something at too high a price, which is diagnostic and has nothing to do with timing. If something is too expensive to buy, then I would choose not to buy it on that merit alone---the presumption of whether it will be more affordable in the future is irrelevant. If it's not, I still won't buy it. Regardless of valuations, I robotically throw a chunk of my monthly pay into market indices without a second thought---I pretend I never had it to begin with so there are no worries there. If the bull market runs endlessly then I won't be missing out. I just won't be as wealthy as I would've been if I YOLO'd everything into the market.

All I know is that in my examination of individual stocks and the market at large, I find it hard to deny that U.S. stocks are generally far too expensive with only a few exceptions, at least by historical standards. For this reason, I'm going very conservative with what I control outside of the retirement account. If prices never drop, then my retirement will assure that my nest egg grows unabated. If they do drop, then I can revisit my watchlists and spreadsheets to see how things stack up in the moment---diagnosis. If something appears fairly or undervalued in the moment, then I would feel compelled to make a purchase. That's not timing anything. It's just looking at the price tag and making a determination on whether it's fair or not."

2021-06-03 07:42:48,stocks,"Great comment!  I do have some degree of faith in humanity's ability to deal with all the upcoming crises that are sure to come, related to climate change and all the other things you mentioned.  That said, I think many people are completely discounting these things and think that it's going to be smooth sailing just like it's been since post-WW2.  We've already had two huge black swan events in the past two decades what with the financial crisis and the pandemic, and I foresee more of these things happening as we go along.

Like you, I still have faith in the market and I think smart, diversified investing will be a good long-term solution.  Short and medium-term, however, I think investors need to be prepared for unprecedented volatility.  I think there's an assumption that advancement has made things easier and more predictable... in many ways, the new interconnected nature of things plus our ability to greatly impact our surroundings can lead to the unleashing of a lot of destructive forces.

Me unfortunately I am not much of an ESG investor.  For what it's worth, I don't have much money in the market, but I suppose you could argue that every little bit helps.  As for me, my part is trying to do the right thing in my day to day life and inspiring people to be happy and have respect for life.

2021-06-03 02:40:17,stocks,"I think GDP and unemployment would tell you another story.  And I think your view is a decidedly US-centric one.

Even if we do take your hypothesis true, that would only mean that the fiscal and monetary response have been entirely inappropriate.  More money was created in the first 6 weeks following the crash than was created in all of the aftermath of the financial crisis.  

Either they believed this was a serious issue, or if not, they've had a response that is completely out of proportion.  In my opinion it's both."
2021-06-03 04:21:45,stocks,"It is.  But I think even Mr. White would admit that it's not conclusive.  The jury is out on whether this type of monetary policy is a good idea or not, and that's even within mainstream economics. In my understanding the most prevailing mainstream point of view is that we should start moving away from monetary policy and start focusing instead on fiscal.  You saw this move from the current US administration, but monetary policy also ran hotter than ever.  Most mainstream economists would agree, however, including White, that easy monetary policy is effective and even necessary in the short-term following a crisis. 

But there's still no abiding consensus on the proper use of these policies, and in part we just haven't had enough time or data.  Me personally I think White makes a lot of sense, and he's also by no means some crazy fringe guy.  He also predicted the financial crisis.

Simply think his reasoning is flawed and that it on it's own is not exactly a good indicator that we're doomed for a recession on the horizon. The topical 'GDP is X while the S&P 500 is Y' is not a good argument to make because the S&P 500 is not the whole economy, just a slice of it, and the markets have never been an accurate indicator of the actual economy. So pairing the two together and jumping to a conclusion makes no real sense you'd need to do a deeper dive to really prove the points he's making. Especially his notes on unemployment and the really silly hyperinflation fears were arguments I took issue with as the former has practically fully recovered and isn't due to reasons that particularly harm our economy and the latter has been proven (so far at least) to be about as real of a fear as Y2K.

I even note that we definitely *could* see a recession or crash on the horizon based on that alone but simply find his precise reasoning and doom and gloom to be flawed. I also think this rodeo can go on for another 2-3 years before anything significant happens or hell maybe even longer.

EDIT: Think of it like this; I'm talking to someone and we both agree that this ice berg we're looking at may or may not fall off as it looks a bit precarious. But while I think it's because of global warming and temperatures rising globally the other guy thinks it's a government funded heat ray because he vaguely remembers seeing some guy who looked like the president talking about heat rays one day. I still agree that yeah, that ice berg may or may not collapse but I'm definitely not going to agree on the heatray analysis.

> when the economy isn't fully recovered yet

GDP actually reflects a near full recovery by now as noted in our discussion. This will only continue to improve in the coming months as more states and countries re open and we continue to see a return to normal.

I have spent hours researching this topic, with no luck. My father (a retired antique dealer) has tasked me with figuring out whether a collection of old stock certificates have any negotiable value.

But before I research the individual certificates, I need to know whether he could even legally claim any possible $ the stocks might be worth. According to pretty much every source I’ve read, you need proof of ownership or family connection to claim and endorse a certificate. But from what I can tell all those sources were referring to certificates that were never signed/endorsed by the original owner (which is typically the case when people find old stock certificates).

But what if the person who owned the stock already SIGNED/ENDORESED IT on the back? That’s the question I can’t find a definitive answer to. Of the many old stock certificates my father got in various auctions and other lots of old paper and antiques over several decades, a couple dozen were actually endorsed on the back and never canceled.

**Even though he is not a relative of the original (long-deceased) owners, does the fact that the stock certificates are already endorsed make them automatically ""bearer certificates,"" and my father eligible for any funds they might be worth?**

While it is unlikely any stock certificates are ""bearer instruments"", you may unwittingly have a ""bearer bond"" and that is a potential windfall.  You may not recognize the difference or, depending on how old the bonds are, the language may be very confusing.

I was trying to turn my 30k into 100k so I could pay off some big bills that would actually have a big impact on my life. 100k in student loans, 200k mortgage, medical bills, etc. And I still think I would’ve killed it if trading wasn’t halted. I had planned on pulling it out the next day or 2 tops."
2021-06-02 20:40:27,stocks,"But imagine you sold a call at $10 after buying it at $9 and it jumped to $15. That's what happened to most people selling calls on AMC. Their cost basis were around $5 to $10 and AMC was hanging around that price for months, so they sold calls slightly out of the money for premium and then, last week, it blew past their strike price and they lost ALL up side.

Yes, selling calls can make you a steady stream, but it forces you to miss the flood. Even if AMC does eventually come down, the amount of money you missed because you sold a couple of calls at $10 far out weighs any gain you made from the premium. Being short on volatility is *not* the way to play stocks like these because their volatility isn't predictable -  it doesn't revert and stay down like most other stocks. Being long, now, could have merit, and I'm pretty confident that the optimal play on stocks of this sort is actually to go long on volatility or to just buy and hold."
2021-06-02 23:08:59,stocks,If it keeps shooting straight up I'll sell off a bit to buy back once it comes back down
2021-06-03 08:44:12,stocks,Thats why I visit this sub 😂 This is like the MSM sub for stocks
2021-06-02 21:09:20,stocks,"It's not though. The hedgies didnt cover on catalyst day. They're just paying interest to a bank today. Other retail investors are holding the bags for the people who got rich.  

Acceptable risk taking on the people who got in early sure. But for the people who bought yesterday and today...not so much."
2021-06-02 20:43:20,stocks,"That’s true you’re selling upside potential for a premium. I think BB is perfect because it’s so volatile you get a very high premium (right now). So in my example I could collect a cool 30% premium on my initial investment and the strike is so high even if my shares get called I double up the initial share price, plus the premium I collected. It’s true it could go up 100x, but the risk reward of selling covered calls seems really rewarding to me"
2021-06-03 07:19:55,stocks,"It can be agonizing deciding when to pull the trigger but I am kinda wowed by the people saying they are holding until share prices hits hundreds of thousands of millions even. Just seems like giving up a huge profit out of greed, which is kinda ironic given the anti hedge fund sentiment"
2021-06-02 21:22:19,stocks,Everyone needs to be burned by FOMO once in their lives to realize it is not the way.
2021-06-02 22:29:14,stocks,"Yeah, short-term trading is a zero-sum game. The meme stock investors would probably like to think they're taking money from the hedge funds, but they're instead taking money from other retail investors that got left holding the bag.

I'm tired of the narrative of wealth transfer from the rich to the poor that these meme stocks have. The way people are getting rich from meme stocks is not too different in principle from the way the institutions they're ""fighting"" against got their wealth."
2021-06-02 21:14:30,stocks,"Agreed, 1000000%. Some get lucky, of course, but overall there's far more bag holders than anything.

I realize we live in the YOLO era, but saving and investing responsibly for long term wealth has worked 100% of the time for those who have done it."
2021-06-02 21:16:02,stocks,"Worst case the shares get assigned and you can always repurchase them at the price they get assigned at if you're watching closely enough to know when it hits the strike

Well the real worst case is the shares drop in value, but if they're your long term holds who cares, they'll come back up"
2021-06-03 00:21:42,stocks,"I actually find meme stocks to be the worst for covered calls. Sometimes the IV is relatively low, the price stagnates for months (and it seems like it's never going to take off), and then you sell strike price that is low for a premium that is mediocre simply because you did not think that AMC would go to 25 dollars, let alone 70 (I do not own AMC, but I do have BB, and wish I didn't sell covered calls on them right before this frenzy).

The perfect covered call stocks are the stable boring ones. Meme stocks are good to hold (and sell at whichever price suits you) at times like these. For example, if I had wanted to sell BB covered calls for a 15 dollar strike price (which is now in the money) two weeks ago, it would have been literally worth 1-2 dollars. No one was buying them at such a high strike price until a week ago."
2021-06-03 08:47:19,stocks,"Most likely people that talk like that don't actually hold that much, they just from others to hold to these levels so that they can secure the profits"
2021-06-02 23:11:05,stocks,Exactly. I buy and Sell a Covered Call at the spot I would be happy selling it at. Worst case I collect the premium best case I get premium AND profits.
2021-06-03 10:57:28,stocks,I agree sadly: it makes me frustrated seeing naive people exploited like that though. But then who am I to tell people to invest in or not invest in
2021-06-02 22:17:08,stocks,they will only learn after a .com style crash followed by bear market. it is just matter of time when this type of mentality is so prevalent.

2021-06-03 02:09:00,stocks,"I think one aspect you're missing in this analysis is that moderna was not built to be just a vaccine company. They are developing what has the potential to be a revolutionary drug development/delivery platform with potentially limitless application to human disease. I was excited about them long before COVID because the ability to directly target disease causing genes with RNA therapeutics is a potentially game changing development on the same level as CRISPR based gene editing. On top of that, they're using cutting edge LNP technology to deliver these RNA's into cells (there may be some patent issues surrounding this https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0674-1) 

If you look on their website now, they have multiple drugs in clinical trials for non viral diseases (cancer vaccine, immune oncology, cardiovascular). I think there's no doubt that MRNA at its current valuation is based on hype. There is also a possibility that RNA based therapeutics are the future, and that this is just the beginning. Impossible to predict, but there is a lot of potential beyond COVID."
2021-06-02 22:18:07,stocks,"It is pretty transferable technology for other vaccines too.  Think influenza, cold viruses, etc.  Would allow for fast production.  There are also tons of potential uses for this technology outside of vaccines as was mentioned in another reply."

I’m no biochemist, but a friend of mine told me using mRNA vaccine is a first and depending on the long term effects of this vaccine, this could be a game changer in vaccination industry. I recently read Moderna has started their vaccination research for cancer and HiV. It’s not like they’ll be able to do a quick turn around like the covid vaccine, but eventually when they do, it’s going to be amazing both for humanity and for the investors"

I would own all four and you are set.   Out of the four like Google the best.   Last quarter top line over 30% growth and bottom line over 100%.

But it is the assets Google has that they have yet to monetize.  Plus adding new ones.  Google Classroom for example now has over 150 million active users.   

Google is really good at running up users and then monetizing.  Google has the luxury of having the profits to make it possible.

So for example they have given away storage with Photos for years.     The expense with over a billion active users with Google Photos had to be material.   Now they lose the expense and gain a new revenue stream with people subscribing to Google Drive.

They will do the same with YouTube at some point.  They are allowing the ad blockers.  But they can take away when they want.    We can see it with YouTube TV where you can NOT block ads.  Google puts the ads instream.

At some point Google will do the same with YouTube.   Which will drive more to YouTube Premium subscriptions."

We will see one industry after another eaten by big tech.   But it will mostly be the big guys like Google.

Google is just good at not losing things and gaining new ones.   Look at search and Google continues to gain share and at the same time their chief competitor, Bing, losses share.

Microsoft for example use to have over 90% share of browsers.  Today below 10% and declining.    Even their new Chrome clone, Edge has stopped gaining share and actually declined last month.

However, none of the Big 5 banks like TD or BMO offer them and a majority of Canadians, nor does Wealthsimple, and those brokerages have majority marketshare. 

There’s also a certain psychological need to have round numbers. Even those in the Reddit crowd don’t buy fractionals because they don’t want to own 0.038531 of an Amazon share. 

You also can’t run options on fractionals, and wheeling 100 shares of NVDA at $665 is too rich for some people’s blood. But lots of option traders might be willing to sell wheels on NVDA at $200."

NVidia is an attractive stock because the company is solid, has good guidance, and a great moat that defends it from its competitors. The only barrier right now from retail buying more and putting more supply pressure on the stock is the current price per share. The stock price of $600+ scares a lot of retail from buying, but the split will remove much of that barrier. If NVDA hits its $800 price target by the July split and then readjusts to $200, I predict a nice run to $250 to $275 then it going flat for a few months. 

Semi-related, the split will also attract thetagangers looking to run wheels on NVDA. At 35% to 40% IV, a lower costing stock will attract those like me who want to run covered call on a stock that’s attractive to hold."

Reddit is not a super global power with incredible buying power. 

It's a small catalyst that has been massively hyped.

Consequently, the rest of the stock market goes along for the ride (ever since the first GME/AMC stuff). Lots more people jump in and this influences price. 

Consequently, hedge funds and banks use all that trading to their advantage. This influences price. 

Hedge funds own stocks, shorts, calls, puts. They have refined strategies to make as much money as possible. They can even trade off market. 

Some of them have screwed up. Some of them are making billions.

Second, you do realize that if it really is as big of a conspiracy as you say it is, then the Powers That Be can just pull the strings and force Game Stop's executive board - which ISN'T made up of retail share holders - to dilute the shares? Like if they issued 100 million new shares, what do you think would happen to Game Stop's share price? 

And the moment Game Stop threatens the basic fabric of the market, I guarantee you, the US government will step in and force liquidate the shares or force dilution.

As they are now, I dont think they can be profitable any more selling VG's. Their business is fundamentally over unless they shift away from video games and start making money another way. They have been trying but it hasnt worked in the last 4-5 years.

No growth in 10 years (at least... might be worse if you can go back farther). From 2010 to 2016 they were barely sideways. 2017 was terrible and they never recovered to 2010 levels since then. This year Q1 was worse than 2020 Q1 (prior to covid). I expect Q2 will be better than 2020 due to re-openings but probably still worse than 2019. They are shrinking...

Even when they had profitable years, they were razor thin running margins between 2% and 5%. Combined with no growth and you have a perfect storm for bankruptcy unless they find new ways to make money.

Now all that said, its possible they find new ways to make money however if the same board of directors and execs are in charge, then its highly unlikely to happen because these are the same fools who sucked the wind out of the business the last decade.

One person on WSB just happened to notice the irregularity of the short interest and tried to alert everybody to it (he got lambasted hard by even folks on WSB at first). If gamestop's short interest had been 60% then you might not even have a GME saga to tell. The game now is low floats with high short interest. No seasoned investor would ever consider Gamestop a long term hold based on the business itself unless they drastically change their outlook. Back to this point about short squeezes, the funniest thing is one actually happened in 2019 GME style. Tesla was probably at one point the most shorted stock on the market. Their SP languished in the low 200's to high 100's for a good duration in that year but guess what happened when Elon posted they made a profit. That shit ripped hard. Now Tesla's SP barely moves. Coincidentally, if you check Tesla's short interest, it's probably a lot lower than it was in 2019. People know when a company will legitimately succeed."

2021-06-03 08:29:20,stocks,">	if retail investors hold the entire available float of Game Stop and they’re not selling, how are people able to buy Game Stop shares right now?

Because of rehypothecation and naked short selling creating synthetic shares. It’s a huge problem in our market, as has been reviewed in detail with evidence, both on superstonk and in court cases and FINRA/SEC filings. 

The available float *should* be around 30M shares, and the **total** float is around 70M. But there are perhaps a couple hundred million GME shares in the market. We don’t know for sure how many, but conservative estimates put it at 100-200 million. Multiple independent analyses have concluded by different methods that it *might* be as high as 1.8 *billion* shares. 

Look up the Taser court case or watch last night’s AMA/interview with attorney Wes Christian. Taser was oversold by 200-300%. This predatory short selling happens, and it’s happened many times in the past, and is an ongoing crisis in our financial system. 

>	the moment Game Stop threatens the basic fabric of the market, I guarantee you, the US government will step in and force liquidate the shares or force dilution.

They might, but if they do, it will collapse the entire US financial system regardless. No one would ever invest in our markets again if they did a rug pull like that. Hell, I’m probably not going to once all this is over. Will likely move to investing in Japan’s new blockchain market, or somewhere that isn’t as shady and manipulated as the US markets. We’re hosed no matter what happens. GME is just a symptom and the tip of the iceberg."
2021-06-02 23:22:18,stocks,"It's interesting that you bring up ""how can there be stocks to sell?"" This assumes that the system is finite,  which it should be. However, hfs can loan out shorts multiple times on the same share multiplying a shares tradeability. ""Market makers"" (Citadel is one) can ""rehypothecate"" the stock up to %140 of cap. Sounds a lot like counterfeiting to me. How else could one explain months of institutional ownership showing over 100%...or the January SI being at %140? These statistics were across the board, yahoo finance, trading apps, tda, Bloomberg machines. So the assumption that only the total float can exist is faulty."
2021-06-02 23:10:36,stocks,"""How are people able to buy Game stop shares right now?""

The fact you ask this question tells me you know very little about how the market works. Market makers are obligated to provide liquidity, by any means necessary including naked selling of shares.

The President of Interactive Brokers in an interview stated plainly that they stopped people being able to buy because the price ""could have gone into the thousands"". He literally said those words. If it went into the thousands, his firm would have been fucked.

Read about the risks of shorting a stock. You will inevitably see the line ""The risk of loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited since the price of any asset can climb to infinity.""

If people refuse to sell but the hedge funds HAVE to buy shares to cover their shorts (due to a margin call) eventually algorithms will take over to get shares. The price will go up to a point where people are willing to sell. If nobody wants to sell until it's a million dollars, they will sell for a million dollars.

If the actions of the hedge funds have been so egregious where they have created so many synthetic shares that retail actually owns the float or more than the float, than they have put themselves as close to that theoretical infinite loss position than anyone ever has.

And if their is a theoretical infinite loss, it stands to reason on the other side of that transaction is a theoretical infinite gain.

If the price hits $1000, that would just confirm that this thesis is true. If it hits 1k it can hit 10k. If it hits 10k it can hit 100k. You see where I'm going with this?"

These people are about to lose every penny they have. They’re going to lose their jobs, they’re going to lose their retirements, and they’re going to have no idea why.

2021-06-03 00:47:09,stocks,"See, what kills me about Wall Street Bets is not that they're making tons of money from these short squeezes - all power to them - but how irrational the thinking gets. Your post is a perfect example. You *really* think the US government will allow retail traders to squeeze the market until it collapses the system? You really think you're going to over throw the 1% by dumping money into Game Stop and AMC?

This is where it goes beyond what can be considered rational gambling, and into the mind set of Occupy Wall Street. We all know there is an intersection there - people who have long felt left behind by the system, anger & contempt for the rich and their corruption. But just as Occupy Wall Street failed to bring any revolution, the same is the case for Wall Street Bets. Because the people running the show will never allow a bunch of angry protestors - whether in person or online - to threaten the fabric of the financial system.

And trust me, you're not threatening anything pumping two stocks with a combined market cap that's less than Roblox. Any one of the real blue chip companies have a market cap *fifty times* that of Game Stop. To even touch one of those companies, you'd need a fifty times the capital of Wall Street Bets. If you can't even pump a company past the bottom 100 of the S & P 500, how delusional do you have to be to think you can short squeeze the entire market and threaten people's retirement funds?

Transfer every cent from Game Stop into Apple, and you'll move Apple's share price by maybe 1 to 2%. And there's dozens of companies in the league of Apple. The reason these blue chip stocks don't move while Game Stop and AMC go to the moon is because the amount of money it'd take to move them is simply too enormous - there's not enough money in the US to pump and dump a company like Apple. 

Yet, this same mathematical inevitability applies to Game Stop and AMC. The higher the share prices gets, the less it can move. You can force the hedge funds - those that are against you, in any case - to exit at a loss but you can't multiply that loss past a certain limit determined by the capital that is available to squeeze.

All of the short squeezes Wall Street Bets is doing makes for entertaining news, but they're just a side show, in the end."

2021-06-03 02:50:48,stocks,"No where in there does it say a market maker can create a share that doesn't exist. Yes, a market maker *can* short a stock to sell to you if they don't have one on hand, with the promise to cover it later. But they aren't *obligated* to. This is why certain stocks and funds have liquidity issues - where you *can't* sell or buy at market price and an order takes forever to fill. Guess what, this isn't an issue with Game Stop, so there obviously *is* enough liquidity to go around. 

[Market makers can't create liquidity if *no one* is selling.](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/selling-bear-market-does-your-broker-buy-your-shares/) They can only facilitate trading by moving shares from one party to another and profiting from the spread.

Short squeezes dump when they're over as well. Also AMC conveniently hit a wall at 70. Which happened to be the top of the option chain at the time before MMs released new strikes . So there was likely some gamma squeeze mechanisms taking place. 

For the record I own no AMC and bought puts on it which I quickly noped out of once I saw what was happening a few days ago. But it has been incredibly fun to watch from the sidelines.

Also, why do you assume my belief that they have no chance to crash the market indicates I think Game Stop will crash?

Wall Street Bets can keep this up for a long time since ""buy and hold"" is the easiest strategy on earth - you just have to do nothing. But it doesn't threaten the market at all. Game Stop can have a market cap of $100 billion - five times its current value - and it'd still threaten nothing. Whether it gets there or not is irrelevant to my argument, which is that this is a side show. Hell, Tesla is even more over valued at twenty times the market cap of Game Stop, but that doesn't indicate Tesla will go down any time soon."

You can't CREATE more shares, and delayed delivery still requires delivery - it's just a matter of timing. No market maker is going to sell you a stock that they can't reasonably obtain for a profit. That is the bottom line you're missing. If the entire float is owned by retail and retail is not selling, market makers can't do anything."

Apple: float 16tril average volume 96mil today 1,8mil

Both the customers and the theater gains from this, in my opinion. 

Is it bad that (the?) largest movie theater chain in the entire country (US) is talking directly with retail investors who hold their stock as well as using their input to actually make informed and collaborative changes? 
Is it bad that AMC may offer a more desirable experience after this whole thing BECAUSE of the amount of money coming to them as well as said input from people who actually care and want to see AMC do well? 

I really don't see a downfall to this 'unless' AMC doesn't at least 'try' to offer an enhanced experience. People are going to want to go back to movie theaters."

This is what Hedgefunds do; they profit from bankrupting companies. Not only did they short these stocks, they used *leverage* to short them, essentially going all in on this bet. 

But many people caught onto this, that these hedgefunds had exposed themselves completely, and that if these companies didn't go under, they would be absolutely fucked. And so an organic community formed behind this idea; to save these companies and fuck over hedgefunds. With each month that goes by, as the news spreads, the price of these stocks stabilizes at a higher and higher point, forcing the hedgefunds to pay more and more in margin calls, forcing them to liquify their other holdings as they desperately try to make the bleeding stop. But it won't stop. Because we won't sell. Because we like these companies. We like the stock."

If you weren't so emotionally triggered, you'd see that this paragraph **PERFECTLY APPLIES TO YOU**.

I understand how when a cultist is challenged, I am not attacking an idea, *I am attacking their entire personality and community*. Hence the outlandish, hyperbolic, insulting, over-the-top, outrageous reply. Hence you doing exactly what I say you do.

Ironically, this all began because one of your cultist brothers did the same thing ""OMG LOL"".

You did the exact same thing I described above... you couldn't take a second for self-awareness.

I captured your reply perfectly and you're literally so programmed that you just ignored me calling you out and did exactly what I said.

I expect overall revenue and profits to begin to skyrocket in the second half of the year, and carry on that trajectory for many, many quarters, with their booming e-commerce figures leading the charge the whole way through. Take a gander at what their new chairman did to the last company he overhauled, Chewy, which now rivals Amazon in the pet market. More specifically, note the timeframe of earnings reports vs. company value.

I'm extremely curious to see what their Q1 earnings report reveals next Wednesday, June 9th - though it's important to note that the vast majority of the benefits that the company is seeing from their growth plan combined with millions of new shareholders purchasing from the company they are part owners of won't be seen until the *next* earnings report following this one.

2021-06-02 22:04:31,stocks,"When you buy a share of stock, you're buying a part of a company that has some total value or worth. If a company issues more shares, your ownership slice of the company gets smaller.

So $AMC, which was trading around $6.50 in Jan 2020 in normal times, isn't just 10x more expensive right now. They diluted their shares 4x (meaning they issued 4x more shares), so $AMC is actually 40x more expensive than they were in Jan 2020.

In other words to return to its pre-pandemic valuation the stock would need to trade at $1.625 (not $6.50)."

LOL! This is one of those low-IQ cult things where you post unrealized, unsold gains as ""real"", claiming to ""be up"" before you sell, right?

Don't you cultists say ""It's not a loss until you sell?""

Funny how it's not a loss until you sell, but you're up 600% without selling.

🤷‍♂️

You can dip in and out on the daily. I've already recouped all of my initial investments so now it's just a profit train to moneyville.

2021-06-03 00:46:09,stocks,Why do you care about my trading strategy so much? Kinda sus. The hedge funds can have my shares if they want since I don't discriminate/care who buys my shares. Idgaf
2021-06-02 22:18:59,stocks,Yeah but the companies balance sheet increased as a result of selling shares which means there is more inherent value in the company
2021-06-03 09:22:12,stocks,"Certainly! We're on exactly the same page about that, or course.

The whole concept of an ""infinite"" squeeze doesn't really suggest the price of the stock will transcend numerical value - which I'm sure you know, but just to guard against potential readers who might see the word ""infinite"" and immediately leap to assumptions about the squeeze itself being imaginary nonsense or how investors in a stock are delusional, etc.

That said - and I know this is an unpalatable suggestion to many people who are still under the impression that GameStop is the same dying, decrepit husk of a brick and mortar company that it was in 2019 - I have the utmost confidence that, with the current short and long term corporate revitalization roadmaps being what they are, the company will see a surprisingly rapid, likely permanent, 4-figure stock valuation.

I really appreciate the pleasant and respectful discourse, by the way. It's utterly mad how few people can't separate the irreverently goofy, youthful joking around that goes on in socializing-specific subreddits, from the fact that investors in this particular stock are no less knowledgeable (and in my honest, economic-academic opinion, in many cases much more so) than any other investor.

As a value investor first, I like GME's business plan, and as an activist investor second, I like that they're an historically, monumentally over-shorted microcap stock that may allow millions of lower- and middle-class common folks around the world to see a bit of real change in their financial lives.

I make every effort to not *recommend* any specific investment - stocks or otherwise - to anybody. I do recommend that, if you have the time to spare and an interest in learning more about the (forgive me for using this phrase) ""dark underbelly"" of the securities market as a whole, you'll find an incredible wealth of information in that regard in places like the subreddits DDintoGME and Superstonk."

It makes it impossible to filter out the things you really want and they don’t limit or punish those abusing the system. Also the pricing on UK’s version is exorbitant for used shit vs America I was able to nab some gems for super cheap (which is how it should be used as a thrift online).

I was a long time user of Depop from the states but haven’t been able to purchase anything I like since so I deleted the app and haven’t used it other than to check if there’s still tag griefing and high prices."
2021-06-02 21:26:55,stocks,"I think the company has solid value, but a few downsides to consider are: 1) It got a one-time, unsustainable revenue boost from COVID last year with so many people making masks and stuck at home where they're more likely to do in-home hobbies such as crafts; 2) It relies heavily on brick-and-mortar stores which haven't been doing so well in the previous years leading up to COVID; and 3) It has a lot of debt, even with some of it being erased with their IPO."
2021-06-03 02:49:48,stocks,What did you learn?
2021-06-03 02:18:28,stocks,You probably earned a lot on it already. So I would recommend to sell a few shares / 1 share which will cover your initial investment costs and gamble with the remaining shares. That way you actually cannot lose your initial investment. AMC is already at an extreme valuation though. So maybe you also start looking for the next meme.

Then what will your idea be to sell it off or trade then?  Well the wall street money short sellers don't care about nothing but profits and any single cent to make off buyers thinking they're getting in on a good deal then you see the stock lose value and you think to sell it then what?  Be a big bear.  The whole ""APE"" hype going around is just a metaphor for ""Dumb 'Money""  so that is a **trend** for buyers making profits for the seller, or the ""Smart Money""."

2021-06-03 02:35:23,stocks,Thats not the right way to look at it. Actually AMC is already at a much higher valuation than GME (28B vs 19B USD). You need to look at the market cap rather than share price.

But right after the squeeze it will drop as quickly as it rose. And unlike GME short investors are now aware of collective betting. So my advice would be to do everything possible to cover your initial investment (maybe with a nice bonus) and use the rest of your gains for continued gambling."

2021-06-02 20:34:52,stocks,"How old are you?

The reason I ask is that if you focus too much on a cash stream, you lose out on a whole lot of gains which can then generate that income stream you need.  Here's how I would play it:

* Growth combined with stability.  You don't want to lose your principle, but you want to grow with the market.  Nothing hurts you long term in this category like a market / stock decline.
* Once you get to a position you're comfortable, shift slowly.  You may have bought a high flyer like TSLA or AMC, but you don't want to lose the gains you've made.  Go to SPY or VTI for the solid returns without incurring the risk of a SEC violation taking out your CEO or Chairman for too many tweets.  
* Index funds pay maybe 2% in dividends.  You don't want to focus purely on that as a 2% dividends combined with 2% in growth means you can sell that 2% and still see a 4% rate of return (2 + 2 = 4) which is how we can be safe with a 6% rate of return
* The variation on the above bullet is to then go after a CEF which pays a flat dividend (based upon stuff like NAV) which can yield that 9-10% as well.  Point is that you can have someone else manage your dividends and just pick the premium along with the investment portfolio to give you the rate of return you want.  
* Options chains exist for an income stream, presuming you don't want to go with naked calls.  But a wild swinging market can upset the equilibrium of a steady income stream.
* Get a job.  $12.5/hr working full time gives you $25K a year pre-taxes (2000 x $12.50).  Of course higher paying multiples will help you here so that you can get by with 10 hrs of work at more pay.  This includes buying into a business or into a seasonal job.  

Rule of thumb for me.  4% rate of return meaning $500K.  It'll cover inflation."
2021-06-02 22:46:16,stocks,"This answer covers how does someone make 20k without direction aside from direction.  Hopefully this encourages further research.

# How do you make money with stocks

There's two levers add cash or add buying power.

With 150k, PM margin (6x leverage), and solid understanding of delta neutrality -- that's do able every quarter.

# How can using standard margin help

Moving past and extreme retailer, you have standard margin (2x leverage) that opens a lot of strategies.

Selling puts on dividend stocks (that you'd be willing to buy). Worst case scenario is you own stock. This approach pays 3-6x more than the dividend (but no appreciation)

If you get assigned then take the stock and sell covered calls (1-3x)

I don't actively follow these guys but stockoptionschannel's ""YieldBoost posts"" have many get rich slowly versions of these ideas.


# What about cash accounts

Within cash accounts (eg Roth IRA); I typically buy /MES micro s&p futures over SPY directly.  

Each contract equals 50 x SPY using $2k buying power.  That leaves 13k for low volatility dividend stocks and enables appreciation.

Then I ensure my ""portfolio beta weighted position"" stays around 0.75 to 1.5x net liquidity (google it).  That keeps my sleeping well and collecting on.

# How could I take that further

Stepping on level further is Ameritrades support of full futures in IRA. Within one account I use:

- 1 x long NASDAQ future

- 1 x short NASDAQ future call

- 1 x short ES future

- 1 x short ES future puts

- Collateral Required: 50-75k

- Theta decay = $85 / day

- average quarterly return -5 to +12k"

“You need to invest 10k a month” and “if you’re young put in $5k a month” are of no use whatsoever. 

Those amounts could range from x to y % of someone’s income, and your claim of needing that amount to get to a million depends a on timeframe AND % returns. 

If you invested or even saved 10k or 5k a month you’d have $960k in 8 and 16 years respectively, without even accounting for compounding returns based on anything from X to Y %.

Needing 5 or 10k a month would be completely dependent on various factors lmao"

No. The money is still in your bank. The brokerage is letting you buy stock with money you don't have because they want you to feel like you're getting action. If they told you to wait 4 days for ACH to catch up they know you'd cool off and maybe just take the money out again.

Not to mentioned there was still the learning curve for that and heard prices were sky high for getting in them. So sold that next day when it doubled, but not as early as I should have after hearing you shouldn't sell at the open and wait an hour for the price to come down as this is normally the case with meme stocks. Unfortunately that didn't happen... it dipped from $38 to $36 immediately and then kept climbing... me sitting there refreshing waiting for the supposedly hour range where they'd be at lowest for the day.... watching 1700 shares go higher, and higher, and higher, losing 2 grand for every $1.16 increase in price.. but I got out. turned out to be a much bigger loss then I even thought. Was up $22K on AMC on the year and now down $33K. $55K swing. Well at least I got out lower then where they are even right now after the reversal ($48 post-market now). 

Really just want to walk away and focus on other aspect of my life that don't bring me stress, but I did end up getting back in today hoping to go long this time and push for $100+. Got in around $55 and kept slowly adding up to $67, only to see it reverse. Was up $1,400 at one point before reversal and got out on a stop loss order I set for a $500 loss (triggered at $57.25), adding another half grand to my loss total. Somehow I'm still up $10K for trading on the year.... but I know that's just what I sold this year, not from this years trading... most of that work was done last year. Going to tell myself I'm up on the year though. 

Probably will try to catch it on its way up tomorrow. Maybe Just keep trying to do that with setting stop loss orders after I purchase for even closer the entry I got in. IDK. Probably will be a loss of time with this vitality I'll have to catch it right on a good leg up. I. Don't. Know.

I know two people that got in early. Much easier that way when already pulled your investment and just playing with the profit at this point. Both got in around 12. One is up over $250K and another $45K and pulled his initial investment. $250K dude says he's holding for over $100. I'm like where was my damn tip when my dumbass was shorting?

2021-06-03 17:37:50,stocks,"The danish donkey is a newly listed company and I would consider it the best very long term play I have. It’s currently trading under its ipo price which is nice - lots of upside. It’s a bike renting company, and it seeks to dominate the parts of Europe that really likes bikes (Holllqnd, France, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden ect).

Play Magnus is a meh stock that are heading upwards now, (Norway likes chess), however I am considering dumping it within the month.

Polight has invented a new type of screen lens, and is either going to get bought at overprice by another company or will be at 500+ at the end of the summer. However it’s quite volatile these days. I personally have a sell target of around 800+ NOK within the year, maybe update if the potential is a great as some estimate. (People are throwing wild price targets at this - upwards to 2000+ given its low amount of outstanding shares.)"

2021-06-03 06:10:48,stocks,"Sry I forgot to mention that TSLA is the only position that already did a x10 for me. I cannot liquidate too much because of tax reasons (I did cut it in half tho). Also, I don't think it's impossible that TSLA will do another x10."
2021-06-03 13:46:41,stocks,"Mind Medicine is a company that researches therapy with psychedelics and looks pretty interesting. Also my girlfriend has experience with thoses types of therapy that's why I liked it. Also there was a post about it on a subreddit which I've read. That convinced me. 

Quantafuel has a partnership with BASF and is currently building new facilities. They are on track to become profitable soon.

Embracer is profitable, is it not? I think their business strategy is good and there is potential.

As I said, I'm new to this and I also got told that I shouldn't just look at revenue/profits."

2021-06-03 08:58:35,stocks,Congrats on that!
2021-06-03 05:57:11,stocks,"All of the meme stocks are heavily shorted.

The GME/AMC subreddits have had people communicating and crunching numbers. It’s gonna be ugly lol"
2021-06-03 19:28:37,stocks,I suppose then that I’d want to do both. I enjoy having longer term investments but I also enjoy the short-term profit
2021-06-03 06:35:33,stocks,I would think so since overvalued growth stocks don’t usually fare well with inflation. Because future earnings is not an interesting metric in an inflationary environment. But hey predicting such things like the scale of inflation is impossible and can’t know for sure how the federal reserve would react (raising interest rates). Besides I can’t imagine people prioritising a Tesla (kinda luxury) when inflation hits over necessary things - especially if wages does not immediately follow the rising prices on everything.

It turns out that people are very picky about pet food, and get extremely chatty on the phone about their pets.

Chewy customer service encourages touchy-feely engagement, rather than slam-bang triage and closing.

Amazon customer service is only there to read you the part of the website you didn't look at, or to issue a refund without caring about the actual state of the product or where it went if it never reached you."
2021-06-03 06:42:39,stocks,Their price point is competitive with all the above and none of their competitors can touch their customer service.  Their growth has been incredible and their margin has been increasing.  They're a gold mine all the way around.

market has consistently gone up but APPL is not in spot light right now. It’s 125 now. Great investment stock long term.
You should do fine. I would have split it between DIS, which is a reopening stock and should be moving
up this yr. Just my opinion. Good Luck."

It’s value, financials, insurance and snubbed stocks of 2020. Sometimes these moves are short, in this case it is long. Everyone has a different investment strategy. 
I am not a financial advisor. Stock investing can be difficult and scary. Look for warning signs. I used to have a rule that depending on the new position, I would expect not to be in the green consistently for at least a month. 
Growth will return. And strong, when, I don’t know"

2021-06-02 20:19:51,stocks,"You cannot argue that a farmed fish is better than a natural, free fish. Overfishing is a regulatory issue. In canada, you get a license and can only fish 2 salmon a year. Sometimes they shut down the fishery if numbers are low. Maybe other countries should start looking at regulating their fishing, like they do with hunting. Kind of like chickens and cows, they aren’t wild but they taste way better fresh from a farm than they do a packed slaughter house pumping them full of hormones and shit."
2021-06-03 15:21:59,stocks,"Aquabounty doesn’t pump any antibiotics in it.  The problem with your assessment is you expect countries to behave sustainably…it’s not going to happen.  Most of the fish eaten in this world are from land based aquatic farms, ocean farms(which spread disease and kills the ocean floor), big fishing rigs (which trap and kill any and all sea life). Very few are caught on poles.  The majority of America’s fish come from abroad(leaving a huge carbon footprint). AQB uses genetic technology to grow fish faster in land based systems- thus saving the need to overfish especially since humanity is already past capacity.  World population will continue to grow, thus exasperating the problem. AQB uses no antibiotics and the fish contain no metals…ocean fish have high metal and plastic content.  Ocean is also heavily polluted with toxins such as Fukushima nuclear waste and oil and trash.  It’s your choice, but ultimately science and health win."
