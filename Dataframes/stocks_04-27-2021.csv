2021-04-27 19:52:38,stocks,"I like realty income (O). It historically has high performance, a strong dividend, and pays the dividend monthly too."
2021-04-27 19:49:15,stocks,I really like NRZ probably the strongest dividend return for the price as well as decently priced options for passive option sells
2021-04-27 19:12:00,stocks,It still looks fine.  Honestly only 230 EOY would be disappointing because it was that high in February.
2021-04-27 19:48:28,stocks,Sell the news
2021-04-27 19:14:58,stocks,">  Is it normal to see such a drop after hours on the day of an earnings report.

yes, earnings are literally a coin flip because you have no idea how investors will react to earnings. save yourself the headache, don't try to anticipate them"
2021-04-27 19:48:26,stocks,The price dropped for us to buy more for cheaper.
2021-04-27 19:04:12,stocks,"tesla yesterday. Microsoft and texas instruments today. all positive earnings, all dropped. im curious as to the reason as well."
2021-04-27 19:14:04,stocks,"Buy COST now, if it dips after ER then raise cash and buy more."
2021-04-27 19:04:24,stocks,"It is not normal to see these drops on good earnings. It is a very good indicator that things may not be well on the market (I say this based on other indicators taken in tandem with the observation you're making).

Also, PINS is overvalued as a stock which doesn't help. 

I won't get into the specifics, but the stock market is incredibly and demonstably overvalued, buyers are leaving the market and many are clear and certain there will be a correction soon."
2021-04-27 18:34:15,stocks,That must be one bouncey cat to jump above the four week high after hitting its 52 week low.
2021-04-27 18:59:47,stocks,Does Reddit give out shill awards?
2021-04-27 18:26:10,stocks,Dead cat bounce
2021-04-27 18:34:56,stocks,What's the chances of it being place into the S&P MidCap 400?
2021-04-27 18:48:11,stocks,You mean ALL TIME LOW
2021-04-27 18:30:27,stocks,On a company with a Forward P/E Ratio of 6.5 (At the time Barclays posted) for FY 2022? I highly doubt it.
2021-04-27 18:52:27,stocks,"There's not enough of a float for that. Insider's hold  94, or a little less than 94 percent of the shares. In time, certainly though. I need to refamiliarize myself with the S and P's requirements for index inclusion before I can give you a definitive answer on that however."
2021-04-27 18:58:09,stocks,"My entry at near the all time low will print, so no worries here.  I will paper hand profit again, probably this week."
2021-04-27 18:54:26,stocks,One in the same.
2021-04-27 19:57:22,stocks,"Forward P/E is not a good metric to use.  Why compare today's known stock price to unknown future earnings? But in financial,  10 is about what you can expect."
2021-04-27 18:33:21,stocks,"Don’t listen to this clown above , small investors that don’t make money, just get jealous. UWMC is a clear winner. Dividend yield is huge. And earnings should be massive."
2021-04-27 19:00:56,stocks,Just curious..that would be a huge catalyst
2021-04-27 18:37:47,stocks,"I think youre looking at your chart upside down

What are you like, 30% off IPO in a steep neverending nose dive ever since?

4% dividend yield makes up for losing almost half of your principal though lol

ALSO, ""earnings"" LMAO"
2021-04-27 19:21:30,stocks,"Yea but that would require Mr. Ishba to release a large part of his holdings... This is why they were not included in the russell 3000...I am bullish on rhis, but until he sells a large amount of his shares ...  indexs will not allow them to join to prevent the Ishba family from getting  stupid rich selling their shares to the Index funds.

Esit: this was the last post i read on it. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m911ba/uwmc_is_not_on_the_final_russell_index_inclusion/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I got the impression is was because ownership was too high. Maybe. If this information is wrong that makes me happy my august calls will print."
2021-04-27 18:40:29,stocks,"TDA app tells me:

Latest earning Actual: 0.00

EPS: - 0.11

Maybe I'm missing something"
2021-04-27 19:49:32,stocks,"Actually, their allowed into the Russel Index. I'm not sure what you're getting this from. They weren't added last quarter, because they were not regarded as an IPO, but June is the annual reconstitution so they should be fine then."
2021-04-27 18:50:25,stocks,"Like, right off the bat that's wrong. The company went public in January, and had their Q4 2020 earnings on Feb 2. Their EPS was .62 beating analyst expectations of .32?"
2021-04-27 19:00:02,stocks,You are clearly missing something...ESP was .62 and expected was .32
2021-04-27 18:57:47,stocks,That's what I have
2021-04-27 19:28:18,stocks,"I wonder why TDA is showing those numbers then

I also remember reading something about UWMC manipulating their earnings to show profit when they actually had losses, but I can't find anything on google about that so I'm not sure if that was some reddittor talking out their ass or not"
2021-04-27 19:22:04,stocks,"The GME-related subreddits are basically cults. They are all teaching each other about the stock market but none of them is actually qualified, so they're just learning total shit. The things they say barely even make sense. They use words in completely incorrect contexts, they misinterpret data, they ignore everything that doesn't reinforce their belief that they are going to be rich.

Whatever happened to GME is not happening anymore. GME will not go above 200 again. Maybe 300 at a push."
2021-04-27 18:50:10,stocks,The stock bottomed out at $3.77 in March and then ran to $500... you think thats not a squeeze?
2021-04-27 18:43:38,stocks,"Since so many people on WSB are holding GME shares, you may consider contacting a company such as [ShareIntel](http://www.shareintel.com/index.cfm) to investigate what the hedge funds have been doing exactly. Moreover you could propose this to the board and management of GME since you probably hold quite a bit of voting power by now in aggregate. You could also [contact](https://smithonstocks.com/contact-us/)  [Larry Smith](https://smithonstocks.com/about-us/), who worked with ShareIntel and has lots of knowledge of [naked short selling](https://smithonstocks.com/part-10-of-illegal-naked-shorting-series-legal-shorting-of-stocks-is-a-losers-game-but-illegal-naked-shorting-transforms-it-into-a-winners-game/) and stock price manipulation by the usual suspects. ShareIntel and Smith might even be interested to work on this pro bono given the public interest in the case and the fact that it led to congressional hearings. They have been strongly critical of share price manipulation by hedge funds."
2021-04-27 18:26:45,stocks,GME has already gone further than folks ever expected. The speculation of the crowds is unknowable!
2021-04-27 18:54:29,stocks,"People put out ridiculous numbers like that because it fits their narrative and serves as a false anchor point to get other people to think, ""That's ridiculous to expect $1,000,000 per share, but if it even hits 1/100 of that, I'll be rich!"" Hypothetically, it could be get to that number. Realistically, the chances are exceptionally low. What is a realistic number? I have no idea, but it's not $10,000 per share, or even $1,000 per share. If those numbers were realistic, institutional investors would be all over it to make a ton of money and screw over their competitors. Of course, institutional investors *have* been buying into it to a degree, but not to the degree that that would be warranted if all of the crazy narratives about Gamestop were true."
2021-04-27 19:02:12,stocks,"I’ll say this from a traders perspective. Anyone that tells you a price is either A) Incredibly smart or (more likely) B) doesn’t know wtf they’re talking about.

The best thing you can do is sell some shares to make back your initial investment and let it run. Another option is have a stop loss or stop profit. If it’s up 20%+, let it go down like 5% before getting out. If you’re down 10% gtfo

In 1999 stocks jumped huge percentage points for just  announcing “we will make a website”. Price predicting is a weird game to play. Riding the wave and have an exit strategy a better play"
2021-04-27 18:23:31,stocks,"Theoretically, the moon is the limit.

Realistically, noone really knows, and if anyone tells you otherwise, they're either from the future or they're just speculating."
2021-04-27 18:45:29,stocks,"Seriously ...it's never going above 400 again that ship has sailed so talk of 1k, 10k, 100k that's just a ridiculous fantasy. There are only 2 stocks over 10k and only 1 in history over 100k and let me tell you Gamestop is no Berkshire Hathaway"
2021-04-27 19:55:53,stocks,"I don’t understand enough about how short selling works. But I feel like there is a price where bankruptcy is better than covering shorts, and it’s a lot lower than 1mil a share. Am I right that this could occur and shorts just say fk it, fold and don’t cover?"
2021-04-27 19:52:34,stocks,Sell
2021-04-27 18:31:35,stocks,I hold xx shares I intend to own a xxx I plan to sell half at 1k and ride my other half on the way up mathematically the squeeze is inevitable I don’t believe in some 10 mil floor or whatever 1k is very reasonable and obtainable from the price we are currently at now. We cruised from 150-450+ in what was almost no time it will squeeze or the gooberment will step in and won’t allow the squeeze as long as everyone holds that says they are Holding and no one is selling that says they won’t the sky is the limit idk about 1 mil limit or anything cuz even I myself will def sell all shares before hitting 1 mil a share lol
2021-04-27 18:26:21,stocks,I know for sure there is a more than 0 but less than 100% chance of it going to 1k.
2021-04-27 19:24:58,stocks,Institutional ownership of gme is like 40mil lol black rock holds over 9million shares themselves vanguard around 9mil papa Cohen 9mil thats thats 27mil just from three entities and there’s a lot other institutions in on gme with over a million shares
2021-04-27 18:25:13,stocks,Understood. I’m asking for YOUR opinion - as you are not in the GME echo chamber. Very curious what someone outside that environment genuinely thinks.
2021-04-27 18:36:41,stocks,"Thank you. They can say they’ll hold but, faced with $25K, 50K, or $100K (the later of which seems quite literally impossible) they’ll sell for sure. I’d love to see $100K but cannot imagine a world in which that happens."
2021-04-27 19:21:47,stocks,I’m going to hold my other half and hope for the best would be cool for 10-20-50-100k but very doubtful lol everyone freaks out over 10-20 dollar gain they are going to paper hand as soon as they see profit or break even
2021-04-27 19:14:28,stocks,"Swing trader.

Take an hour a day to go though everything each day. Go about my day and just monitor trades to make sure things haven’t hit stop loss/profit"

2021-04-27 18:25:44,stocks,I actually bought it today but not for a short squeeze but an earnings play. It’s stabilized in April after a brutal decline and is undervalued here. I also sold a Call Spread. This and LOTZ are on the top of my undervalued micro cap stocks though LOTZ has more upside potential longterm.
2021-04-27 18:19:06,stocks,Wtf are legit traders and investors?
2021-04-27 17:42:13,stocks,How about ladder attacks 😂😂
2021-04-27 17:53:48,stocks,Idk I find it amusing when shorts get rekt
2021-04-27 17:50:55,stocks,And all the account activity is pretty obvious low effort karma farming on default subs.. not a single thing outside of that. I hate the new wave of Reddit 😐
2021-04-27 17:36:50,stocks,That must be it ;)
2021-04-27 17:47:34,stocks,Buying GEO or CXW right now is straight-up foolish.  It will be at least several years--possibly most of a decade--before the political winds shift back in their favor (if they ever do).  Your money can do much better during that time.
2021-04-27 17:53:55,stocks,"What do you mean? Hedgies are very educated, they are the smart money!"
2021-04-27 18:31:18,stocks,"People who understand 33% short interest doesn’t = a short squeeze

2021-04-27 17:56:38,stocks,Most people do. But a short squeeze is a one in a million. People have no fucking clue what they’re talking about.
2021-04-27 18:51:25,stocks,I don't think this is really new. I can remember this kind of activity back in the day too.
2021-04-27 19:16:27,stocks,"You give us Americans too much credit. 3 years unless GOP's presidential candidate is Ted Cruz, then yes, it'll probably be a decade."

2021-04-27 18:37:47,stocks,I'm looking for short ladders. Which shed are they stored in?
2021-04-27 19:19:41,stocks,The one next to the short bus.
2021-04-27 17:25:59,stocks,"It's down because their guidance for MAU was lower than expected. People who are selling are missing the point. PINS already has more MAUs than Twitter or Snapchat. They need to monetize their userbase, not necessarily grow it tremendously. And they are doing that. 78% growth this quarter and a guide to 105% next quarter. If this thing bleeds to $65 or less, I'll add to my already large position."
2021-04-27 18:49:47,stocks,"I've been meaning to start a $PINS position for awhile now, this may finally get me to pick up some shares"
2021-04-27 17:22:55,stocks,"They missed MAU by 0.5%, overreaction."
2021-04-27 17:16:07,stocks,They beat earnings expectations and their revenue grew 78% year over year. They have a brilliant product and the management is aiming towards long term growth. I’m not worried by a short term offset in user growth. Will buy more tomorrow.
2021-04-27 19:28:27,stocks,"Ladies and gentlemen, merely a few weeks ago Microsoft attempted to buy Pinterest. Enough said. Consider this pullback your buying opportunity."
2021-04-27 18:03:49,stocks,"Just like the Netflix 10% nonsense drop, I also bought some shares here. Had none prior to this, but this is a clear overreaction."
2021-04-27 19:40:48,stocks,This makes me so happy!!!  I hope it tanks tomorrow cause I’m going to buy it up!  PINS is the most underrated social app right now.  Man what a great buying opportunity
2021-04-27 18:05:48,stocks,"Sold 25 put spreads at 3:58 pm at the 60 level, let's watch the iv decay tomorrow."
2021-04-27 19:49:11,stocks,definitely over reaction. They have a solid product
2021-04-27 17:23:37,stocks,"I bought puts in anticipation of this, I'll sell them tomorrow at market open. I have 80 shares and will be definitely be doubling down if it goes back under $70."
2021-04-27 17:29:13,stocks,"I bought 25 more shares at 70.70 during after hours and looking to add another 25 if we go sub 67. Current average is 70.2 after grabbing these shares, losing my 69.69 average lol. Will become my biggest holding next to AAPL and TSM and one of my favorite tech stocks. Just wait for more integration like they have with target. Even without massive user growth they’ll be able to monetize better the users they have in time."
2021-04-27 17:26:03,stocks,"Not about the miss, it’s what the management said about the miss."
2021-04-27 17:29:18,stocks,"> overreaction

The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. 

With that said, I’m buying more around these levels."
2021-04-27 17:54:45,stocks,"Yeah all of the numbers were great except the user growth.  

And it already dropped two weeks ago when Cleveland Research said that they would miss earnings (which they were wrong about).  

Absolutely no reason for this additional big drop. I expect price upgrades in the future and a return to the mid 80’s."
2021-04-27 19:07:45,stocks,Sell 70 strike puts.

2021-04-27 17:36:18,stocks,What did they say? Missed that.
2021-04-27 17:32:04,stocks,Doesn't matter much to me. Will be buying tomorrow off this.
2021-04-27 17:48:11,stocks,"TSM, AAPL and PINS? I think it’s relative but I’m pretty happy with that. I also have a small position in Corsair, but have a a large position in RTX and balanced positions in TGT and WFC which have done well for me as recoveries and SPY. Eyeing JD or SHOP to balance things out and I’ll just keep adding forever, give or take obviously. I have a small position in OSK that’s doing ok, might trim to add elsewhere but it’s so diversified I feel ok with it but it’s so small I forget about it, I’m torn on that."

2021-04-27 17:11:46,stocks,MSFT is a great stock to own not trade. I wanted to own this but it keeps going higher. Sell on the news. Probably overbought as it has gone up 30-40 points heading into earnings release. I wouldn't worry about this. Opportunity to initiate new positions imo. Good luck 🙏
2021-04-27 17:28:45,stocks,"Why?  Maybe if it had gone up 44% from pre-Covid levels instead of 50% it would have gone up 3% rather than down 3%.

I’d be much more concerned if a mega Corp that went up 50% in a year DIDNT have a record breaking revenues."
2021-04-27 18:34:33,stocks,"I’ve learned something about earnings over the past few years. Beating the analyst’s estimates is not nearly as important as beating the market’s expectations for those estimates. Let’s say that the earnings estimates are that the company has grown 50% yoy, but every shareholder thinks, “we are definitely going to beat that by at least another 20%”. If we beat estimates but only match the shareholder’s expectations, then the price will either drop or stay relatively flat. The earnings has to be unexpectedly higher than what the market is anticipating in order to raise the share price. 

TLDR: 
 Beating estimates does not matter. A company has to beat the market’s expectations of its earnings by a margin that we didn’t see coming."
2021-04-27 17:00:28,stocks,For us to buy.
2021-04-27 18:16:13,stocks,"$MSFT down AH is probably just a short-term reactionary move. It will soon settle. Microsoft is one of my favourite stocks and it isn’t going anywhere. It’s a forever-hold in my books. 

They beat EPS and revenue and that’s a sure sign the momentum will continue."
2021-04-27 17:24:03,stocks,What the stock does tomorrow is irrelevant. There was nothing wrong with the quarter and Azure still grew by 50%. I expect you will see analyst upgrades tomorrow morning roll out.
2021-04-27 16:59:48,stocks,It was priced in but they are positioned great long term
2021-04-27 17:15:34,stocks,Well it went up 13% in a month on no news...
2021-04-27 18:32:19,stocks,"Why worry about short term swings? MSFT has been one of the best performing stocks in my portfolio and it is just a forever hold. I never cared for momentary ups or downs. If you look at the bigger picture, with Azure, MSFT is guaranteed to keep doing well.

good time to jump in and buy more. MSFT is a long hold"
2021-04-27 17:16:13,stocks,Because of profit booking. Good time to buy if you sold when it was high. It will go back to $260 unless the market goes in corrections again
2021-04-27 17:30:40,stocks,That’s how earnings work
2021-04-27 18:12:47,stocks,"One reason is “buy on rumors, sell on facts” once everyone knows your advantage or speculation is gone. The other reason (I believe this to be the case for Tesla for instance), a big deal is made of the numbers that suit the narrative, so headline earnings could be up, but net profit is down, or there are other one time charges that are excluded."
2021-04-27 17:37:14,stocks,As expected lol! But I'm long in MSFT.
2021-04-27 18:46:05,stocks,"Most of my stocks go down after good earnings, its normal. MSFT is a great stock to buy and hold."
2021-04-27 17:38:45,stocks,"No one giving you an answer so I'll try.

Another company reported at the same time. Alphabet (Google). Their cloud computing business rose significant, causing many to see them in the future biting into AWD and Azure market share. Wall St loves the underdog vs the favorite.

2021-04-27 18:59:12,stocks,Microsoft ALWAYS dips after earnings. ALWAYS.
2021-04-27 18:33:18,stocks,I would put too much faith in “ pajama traders “ AH moves are on light volumn because real traders are off having beers with buddies already. The best judge of a quarter is 2-3 days after when upside FOMO or downside panic have subsided.

2021-04-27 16:57:05,stocks,AH means sod all but also why do you care? Just buy more and hold
2021-04-27 17:33:02,stocks,Rumours and hype fuel increases in stock value and hard fact like news or earnings are to test the hypothesis and correct overshoot.
2021-04-27 18:38:31,stocks,So we can jump on that dip and make 3% tomoro. That's how it works right?
2021-04-27 17:13:54,stocks,market expected higher

2021-04-27 19:04:11,stocks,"MSFT dropped aftermarket as they reported good earnings, but not great.  Alphabet(Goog) absolutely smoked it and had more quarterly profit and MSFT although MSFT is valued $400 billion more than Goog.

2021-04-27 18:21:00,stocks,"I do wonder at what point it becomes an IBM though.  Surely owning ""the Cloud"" is a lot like IBM's owning the PC back in the day, eventually if someone makes a PC2 for 50% cheaper people will just flock to that."
2021-04-27 19:00:46,stocks,It wasn't priced in since nobody knew in advance. It is hedge funds playing against retail and short term traders. They use software to buy instantly on announcements and then sell short all the way down.
2021-04-27 17:47:29,stocks,No news? winning the govt contract is not news?
2021-04-27 19:05:35,stocks,"It's not speculation, they have software that buys within 1s of an announcement, before anyone else can react. Then they sell short once the price has increased."
2021-04-27 18:08:09,stocks,"Absolutely, in fact I hope it goes down more so I can buy more!"
2021-04-27 18:32:04,stocks,"As they should, Google docs is better than Office 365, and they pretty much created Kubernetes and orchestration of docker containers.  I've always thought it was strange how few people use their cloud when their technology is always so far ahead."

2021-04-27 18:46:37,stocks,"I bought at 238 and 250 earlier this month. Even with the AH drop, I'm still up."

2021-04-27 19:45:48,stocks,I don’t think the estimates will ever truly reflect things accurately. It’s more an issue of shareholders expectations than anything. The estimates could predict all of a company’s numbers perfectly and still be off when it comes to the actual share price if the shareholders think the company is worth something different.
2021-04-27 17:51:54,stocks,No it was at an ATH so it was kind of expected unless it was a huge beat like Alphabet...I am a long term investor so day to day price movements don't matter to me
2021-04-27 17:54:59,stocks,"not when its only a 20bln contract over 10 years for a company with 143 bln in revenue in one year...  ""news"" of a contract - $143bln --> $145bln is practically a rounding error"
2021-04-27 18:34:28,stocks,You think that deserved a 13% rise in 1 month?
2021-04-27 19:32:27,stocks,"Ive used both and still use both, but google docs is not better than office 365. Only thing that gives docs any sort of leg up is that it's free. I would rather use excel, word, ms teams, and outlook any day of the week, hands down."
2021-04-27 19:55:19,stocks,"Google Docs is not better than Office 365, not even close. You may have a point on K8s but there is NO WAY Google Docs is better...Ive seen a lot companies buying Google Docs and then having to go back to msft"
2021-04-27 19:53:48,stocks,"Yeah 100% agree with that - I just think on some level, for a decent amount shareholders , their estimates are pegged to Wall Street (could be that they expect atleast a 10% beat on Wall Street etc..) I just imagine if Wall Street had for whatever reason had slightly lower estimates that still projected growth overall but were slightly below what the current ones were, when MSFT has announced earnings,  nothing has changed from an actual earnings standpoint but the picture looks slightly prettier picture. I saw someone mentioning a good comment earlier - this is an emotional market more than anything else at the moment and prettier pictures are what’s feeding it right now!"
2021-04-27 19:02:59,stocks,"""Priced in"" is just a thought stopper pandered by the media so you won't figure out how the game is played. They can't price in what they don't know yet."
2021-04-27 18:39:44,stocks,Ya but they had historically never entered that government contract space in defense. This could be the start of something.
2021-04-27 18:35:13,stocks,"No, thats why its pulling back. Right?"
2021-04-27 19:53:36,stocks,"What do you feel gives Office 365 a leg up?

As far as criticisms.  Interoperability between apps is bad, document formatting is bad between web and win32.  Teams is a chat app which you can edit documents in, except it closes the documents you were reading when you read a message.  Using VB in 2021 is pretty dreadful.

Maybe having ODBC is nice if you are on prem and using the legacy version of Office, though its becoming kind of obsolete I think as even Microsoft shifts everyone to the cloud."
2021-04-27 17:01:39,stocks,It went down so we can buy in cheaper. Buy and hold.
2021-04-27 16:59:29,stocks,"How about people stop freaking out about the stock  and focusing on the company itself , msft is growing and so will the stock price with it , temporary setbacks are normal ."
2021-04-27 16:50:31,stocks,"Makes no sense how they crushed earnings and fell so much after hours, wish I had money to buy more."
2021-04-27 19:02:00,stocks,"Is it true that Microsoft and Google are the only tech companies that the world wouldn't be able to survive without? If Apple disappears, you can just get a samsung phone.."
2021-04-27 16:56:14,stocks,"Underpromising and overdelivering is expected of MSFT so I guess people expected the ""expected"" numbers to be an underestimate. Still good numbers if you're long-term with MSFT. Might buy another share next week if the price stays down a bit."
2021-04-27 16:53:39,stocks,"Down in AH which means sod all to be honest but good entry point if they are also down tomorrow. Buy and hold, MSFT will do you well"
2021-04-27 18:44:24,stocks,So why is it falling
2021-04-27 16:51:42,stocks,and im getting fucked as it drops freaking 3%
2021-04-27 19:11:21,stocks,MSFT going down after hours i heard. Some whales buying the rumor and selling the news
2021-04-27 16:54:11,stocks,Should have bought google instead
2021-04-27 16:50:46,stocks,And the stock is down haha
2021-04-27 16:57:55,stocks,The magnitude caused it to go down ?
2021-04-27 17:58:51,stocks,"don't forget that eeeveryone will switch to m365 in the coming years and to azure, and thats a lot of subscriptions

our company is at least, right now"
2021-04-27 17:55:14,stocks,"It is up 1500% since February 2009, consider even a 50% pullback should be normal."
2021-04-27 17:15:58,stocks,Maybe because the stock is up 100% since the same time last year?
2021-04-27 16:52:29,stocks,Pins is getting drilled too. AMD will drill tomorrow.  Market makes no sense at times
2021-04-27 17:14:53,stocks,"MSFT is definitely a buy-and-hold stock, so just hang onto it forever and you'll be OK"
2021-04-27 17:34:58,stocks,I mean you’re not swing trading it are you? It shouldn’t matter long term
2021-04-27 17:16:06,stocks,"But you won't get ""fucked"" long term."
2021-04-27 17:16:18,stocks,It will comeback give it a month or two
2021-04-27 18:01:59,stocks,50%? Do you know hoe percentages work?
2021-04-27 18:30:41,stocks,Stop doing drugs
2021-04-27 16:57:58,stocks,You really think AMD will go down tomorrow?
2021-04-27 18:27:31,stocks,they increased their forecast from +37 to +50%. no fucking way.
2021-04-27 17:33:04,stocks,Where can I see which stocks are getting drilled today AH?
2021-04-27 16:58:35,stocks,Judging by recent stocks who beat earnings recently and  went down yes.
2021-04-27 17:01:40,stocks,"I thought it would tank AH regardless of earnings,

sold my 60c near the session high @ 45% gain."
2021-04-27 18:43:16,stocks,Just going off the recent market trends. Part of me wants it to dip so I can buy more. Wouldn’t be mad if it moons though.
2021-04-27 17:47:18,stocks,"Robinhood, yahoo...many have AH numbers"
2021-04-27 17:57:41,stocks,Yahoo finance app.

2021-04-27 17:45:51,stocks,This revenue growth is unreal. I am a happy investor.
2021-04-27 16:45:35,stocks,"Amazing, Intel better watch out because they're being left behind.

Wish I hadn't sold this at $82"
2021-04-27 16:53:30,stocks,"This was expected after Intel reported loss of over 20% in data center.

It's all coming to AMD, plus some.

How anyone is buying Intel stock is beyond me.

Edit: I'll add that Intel is the Nokia of our times, at least for the short term."
2021-04-27 17:14:17,stocks,Good feeling to have both AMD and XLNX in the portfolio.
2021-04-27 18:31:19,stocks,Been holding since $42
2021-04-27 19:30:47,stocks,This is one of my favorite stock to own. Bought 200 shares @ 4.35. Buying and Holding for a long time with this one. Same with Apple and Microsoft.
2021-04-27 17:05:22,stocks,Glad I grabbed some at 74 during the panic over bond yields
2021-04-27 19:18:39,stocks,Lisa Su is one of my favorite CEOs. As long as she is steering the ship I’m going to be happy holding AMD!
2021-04-27 18:52:49,stocks,"If you guys missed out, don't worry, AMD always tanks on fantastic news, then slowly climbs to new highs. Buy the dip if there is one tomorrow."
2021-04-27 16:47:05,stocks,Seems that they are not badly affected by the chip shortage
2021-04-27 16:46:56,stocks,Looking good for AAPL
2021-04-27 18:35:00,stocks,"Wow they beat earnings?! I'm ready for the 8% dip!

 /s"
2021-04-27 17:11:26,stocks,Awesome
2021-04-27 18:44:05,stocks,Why did NVIDIA drop 8% after crushing earnings last quarter?
2021-04-27 17:20:07,stocks,"Wich means the stock will probably drop again.
AMD is reacting so poorly to ERs"
2021-04-27 18:56:30,stocks,Big short.  This stock is going to be taken out by Tesla superchip Elon says they have
2021-04-27 18:03:48,stocks,Im glad to see one of my holdings go up after a good earnings report!
2021-04-27 19:33:58,stocks,Good feeling for a change. They normally drop after an ER regardless if it’s goos
2021-04-27 17:54:40,stocks,I wish I had bought a lot more in the 70s.  It dipped there several times but I'm to the point where I have an uncomfortable amount in it and I don't like loading up on a single stock.
2021-04-27 19:26:00,stocks,Holding 104 shares at $23 in my IRA so I’m in it for the long haul with this one
2021-04-27 17:34:26,stocks,Just sold my AMD before earnings -_-
2021-04-27 17:38:22,stocks,Wish I bought more at $12 : (
2021-04-27 19:23:31,stocks,They've been left behind*
2021-04-27 19:30:26,stocks,With a PE of 12 INTC might have dropped enough to be a buy at this point.
2021-04-27 19:33:35,stocks,Wish I didn't have a 88CC.  Oh well.  88s good
2021-04-27 16:56:21,stocks,"“Undervalued” lol, these people needed to actually hear how intel board were rambling about their losses on last earning"
2021-04-27 18:56:11,stocks,"people who are buying don’t understand how bad the lack of manufacturing capabilities of Intel are. They are several years behind TSM. AMD is almost guaranteed to eat intels market share for the next 5 years. 

tldr: people aren’t doing their DD whatsoever"
2021-04-27 17:52:59,stocks,"I've been trying to say that but all I get in response is MURICA and THEY'RE BUILDING MORE CAPACITY.

It doesn't matter.  They're years behind.  EPYC is going to be a massive growth driver.  Can't wait for 5nm and beyond......basically the current product line but big rumored performance improvements."
2021-04-27 19:07:02,stocks,Intel will come back. Maybe it will take 2 or 3 years but they will. They still lead in market share and I think that won't change much during that time
2021-04-27 19:28:28,stocks,Intel will be back and in a big way. Eventually
2021-04-27 17:14:13,stocks,I picked up some for $22 in 2019
2021-04-27 17:08:44,stocks,"I feel like all the major chip producers are fine, it's just the tech companies that need to purchase chips in a much smaller numbers from ODM/OEM suppliers that are feeling the crunch.  The large comps I imagine have already settled production allocations with TSMC years in advance."
2021-04-27 19:27:28,stocks,"They're not, and people who have done their DD said this already.

Auto manufacturers acted dumb and shot themselves in the foot by lowering their supply. AMD is absolutely fine, along with Apple."
2021-04-27 16:50:45,stocks,Why is it looking food for AAPL?
2021-04-27 17:24:02,stocks,"AAPL is up 10% since I bought it like a month ago. It could be like Microsoft, a huge sell off after earnings. Im not sure if I should sell AAPL right now and buy back if it drops."

2021-04-27 18:35:01,stocks,Google AMD stock after hours....
2021-04-27 17:54:14,stocks,Don't worry it will still go down
2021-04-27 17:23:11,stocks,Can you elaborate on that?
2021-04-27 19:20:56,stocks,"Yupp, agreed.

Everyone wants to jump on the band wagon of supply shortage. The shortage is specifically to vehicles and some other businesses that shot their own selves in the foot. AMD is still making a lot of chips and these earning calls prove that.

Intel's problem is too much supply, due to a significant lack of demand since the demand is going to AMD. AMDs problem is the opposite, extremly high demand that's coming from Intel.

People just wanna cheer the brand name. I keep reiterating that this is the Nokia of our time, at least right now."
2021-04-27 19:18:41,stocks,"Yupp, most people kept saying that.

The stock market operates quarterly, so you can't prove your point until then. We are now seeing our point be proven. These are the  consequences of their lazy(lack of innovation) and manipulative (marketing) actions.

Yeah, I fucking hate their guts lol."
2021-04-27 19:22:34,stocks,"They MIGHT, not will.

That MIGHT is highly dependent on IFF they execute on 7nm on time and don't have more security issues.

As it stands, AMD and Nvidia is already ahead. If you're willing to bag hold until 2023 on an IFF, that's on you."
2021-04-27 19:29:27,stocks,Lol AMD reddit fanboys downvoting you... Intel will be back.
2021-04-27 19:31:00,stocks,"Could, not will.

The could is highly dependent on IFF they execuse on 7nm."
2021-04-27 17:38:19,stocks,Nice. Wish I was in that early
2021-04-27 17:19:59,stocks,"I had some concerns when I find all their products are out of stock, but now I guess it’s just because of the high demand"
2021-04-27 16:52:27,stocks,"Everything is beating estimates, I see no reason why AAPL would be the exception"
2021-04-27 18:16:33,stocks,Just hold Apple. No reason to ever sell
2021-04-27 18:57:39,stocks, Not sure why you are getting the downvote.  AMD has religiously gone down after positive news and reports such as this.  Makes no logical sense.
2021-04-27 19:14:42,stocks,"Two quarters ago they reported loss of 20% in data center. Blamed COVID.

Last quarter they lost more than 20%, blamed COVID again...

They'll blame everything but themselves. Their two strengths are lack of ownership/innovation and marketing."
2021-04-27 17:52:15,stocks,basically on the last Intel earning the board blamed everything else except themselves on their performances and they showed little guidance on how to turn themselves around.
2021-04-27 19:30:12,stocks,Yes they will lol. They are top 2 names (the only 2) in the CPU industry. Who will replace them?
2021-04-27 19:33:08,stocks,Back to what exactly? 0 chance they will get back to their market share pre-2019 in your lifetimes
2021-04-27 19:38:24,stocks,W I L L
2021-04-27 17:43:21,stocks,"Yeah the biggest sector suffering from the shortage is auto right now which makes sense since each comp only produce like 5 mil vehicles a year, compared to Apple which is 200 mil on iphones alone, clearly TSMC prioritizes higher volume customers."
2021-04-27 16:56:47,stocks,Well tbh that's kind of the expectation for most tech. It's by how much you beat that will dictate a positive or negative reaction. If it's not blowout on all metrics like google or amd there will be profit taking considering the huge run up and high valuation all these companies have had.
2021-04-27 17:37:50,stocks,"I think everybody expects Apple to beat, but it's a matter of if the stock price goes up or down after"
2021-04-27 18:35:05,stocks,"The reason to sell, is to buy back at a later dip. I think AAPL is a great company but, I can make more if I sell and buy back at a dip (if it happens).

The downside is if it doesnt drop, then Im fked lol."
2021-04-27 19:37:28,stocks,You sell if you want to actually see the money you made on it
2021-04-27 19:31:33,stocks,Those sound suspiciously like weaknesses

2021-04-27 17:14:55,stocks,"People on the sub really don’t seem to understand that “beat” vs. “miss” is not some binary, pass/fail metric. Just barely squeaking out a beat, especially for a high growth tech company, will probably be a huge hit to the stock price. Absolutely blowing the expectations out of the water on the other hand could cause the price to soar. In other words, not all earnings “beats” are the same."

2021-04-27 18:58:38,stocks,"> if it doesnt drop, then 

you made the gains you had on the sell. You're fine.

If you make a gain and then the price hikes, you still made your gains.

2021-04-27 19:47:34,stocks,"The ARM based ones are already in use in Apple devices. ARM server CPUs in Amazon servers and Google too, Nvidia just made their own ARM server CPU, Qualcomm was and is making laptop ARM CPUs, should have desktop ones soon.

Look the earnings don't lie. They're facts, and facts state Intel is losing market share. It's not all to AMD, part of it is to what I'm stating. Going forward they'll continue to lose market share to the other options.

Right now it's just AMD and Intel for x86, but x86 is not guaranteed forever and the world is moving towards ARM. The future does not look bright for Intel."

Wrong again. Ironically it's exactly services which google, amazon and microsoft provide which lowers the barrier to entry for everything tech related - which is how they make money. That doesn't mean their worst competitor cannot rise from exactly the kind of services they provide.

AI can just as well emerge from the least likeliest places without requiring any big initial resource and just spiral out of control through exponential growth. This is what most scientists and world leaders fear. Nobody is afraid of ML eating data and suddenly growing sentient as it categorizes ads for you.

How much is there? I'm genuinely asking because it's been a while since i've checked a report.

>buying the big 3 cloud guys

Why not just buy the leading grower: MSFT. Their Azure infrastructure is eating away at amazon and google's market shares last I checked. If cloud is your play, it would make sense to go balls deep into them.

I'm not particularly fond of holding either of the 1T+ behemoths. Growth prospects for one reason. Holding VTI for the biggest chunk and dumping money into NVDA makes more sense. I'm sorry I cashed out on the minor gain pre-earning instead of going deep NVDA and holding. Owel, there's always a dip or correction somewhere. Before you ask why NVDA, take a look at their vision and market cap. They're big - but not 1T big (yet) - and they're definitely aiming to be among the top. Ultimately people invest in stock for growth. The more room there is and steadiness ahead, the better the investment.

Not financial advice, obviously. What do I know."
2021-04-27 17:52:37,stocks,"True, but Google also significantly outperformed MSFT before this report.

Lot B:  BUY 1000 RKT @ $23 ---> SELL 1000 RKT @ $31.50: lock in $8.50 gain per share = $8,500 gain

For example, if a stock breaks through resistance and if it has decent liquidity, there's a pretty good chance it will go on to test the next resistance or the same support (old resistance).

If it's on a bull run, charting the channels or trends can help you see when it may break out (up or down). I haven't seen that there's a predictable way to tell which direction but it seems to help establish when a breakout may occur."

If you want to benefit, you should look where prices are increasing, and find companies that can pass along price increases, or even better, companies that benefit from price increases.

If a stock doesn't raise dividends at least at the pace of inflation it is also eroding its future cash flow value to you.  Inflation is therefore not a bull case for value vs growth.

Generally, the way they outperform inflation is if the price improves... and this has happened plenty of times with inflation rising.

**TEXT**

Raytheon Technologies came out with quarterly earnings of $0.90 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.88 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.78 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.27%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this an aerospace and defense company would post earnings of $0.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of 4.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

Raytheon Technologies, which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry, posted revenues of $15.25 billion for the quarter ended March 2021, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.83%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $18.21 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Raytheon Technologies shares have added about 12.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 11.3%.What's Next for Raytheon Technologies?

While Raytheon Technologies has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Raytheon Technologies was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.80 on $15.72 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.64 on $65.13 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Aerospace - Defense Equipment is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1."

2021-04-27 10:56:57,stocks,"You can say that about any stock in retrospect. I opened small position at $60 but kept it small because they have massive pile of debt. Also, you are forgetting that back then we had no vaccine, nobody knew when or if ever we will have vaccine. Their quarterly earning were like 90% revenue decline compared to last year. Yes it was blood on the streets moment and good for brave people who loaded up big back then but also it was time of maximum uncertainty and for some people (like myself) it is more important not to lose money than to make massive all or nothing bets. Having that said I'm glad I've risked a little bit and now I'm happy to reinvest dividends for years on this one."
2021-04-27 11:25:53,stocks,I bought a chunk in the 50s. RTX is fairly safe due to their public sector work. But it’s really about opportunity cost. Many other options were more appealing and had much better returns during 2020.

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Are all pension providers a scam? Now i'm just a dumb ape, but I have been trying to educate myself on the ways of the world financial. Here in the UK we have some kind of auto-enrollment workplace pension scheme where you start a job, you get a side-along pension pot with whatever random pension provider that company chooses into which funds are deposited. I suspect i'm not alone in my generation of largely ignoring this obscure financial thingy and have never made any attempts to manage these pension funds, so i started looking in to consolidating various pots and finding how my money is invested.

My main pot is with a company called 'Nest Pensions'. Their highest performing fund is bizarrely called '**Sharia fund** - A fund with an investment approach based on Islamic law'.... ok, what ever, but it's weird to me a company i never chose to invest my money focuses heavily on islamic banking?

So i'm trying to find details of what fund i'm in and how my money is invested, except my fund isn't listed in their [Quarterly Investment Report - Q4 2020](https://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/dam/nestlibrary/61537-QIR-Q4-2020-210223.pdf) 

For some reason, they only list the 'Nest 2040 retirement fund'. Ok, that's great, but how is my fund performing and what is it invested in?

So here I am reading their '[Statement of investment principles](https://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/dam/nestlibrary/SIP-Mar20-Mar23.pdf)' document.



Which states:

>14.2 The foundation phase refers to the early years of younger scheme members’ working lives as they develop the savings habit. This phase typically lasts five years. The objective for the foundation phase is to keep pace with CPI after all charges.

>14.3 The growth phase is where the maximum growth in assets is being targeted through investing in asset classes that are expected to grow in value relative to inflation more than other investments. The objective for this phase is to outperform CPI plus 3 per cent a year after all charges over the long term.

**Am I reading this correctly, or is the operation of this company to make as little money as possible for 0-20 years? wtf?**

If i was a pension provider, i would take that money, let's say £1000, invest it wherever I want with let's say a ridiculous yolo £1000 return, but oh dear, sniff sniff, poor 0-5 year investor only gets 2% of that money, a whooping extra £20, and i bank £980. Is this legal? How is this legal?

**Wtf is the point of investing money to literally make no money?**"

$CEMI - Same as $ARCT, this HOLDS above the 50EMA and we are good, otherwise we want it to dip back down to $3.70 or so.

$ETSY - Great long term hold, but also a beautiful triangle forming. If this breaks out LONG and we get in at the best value, we are going to see some amazing gains I bet.

&#x200B;

$FFHL - We want some life, but this support is very very strong and we have very low risk given that information. Let earnings run its course first.

&#x200B;

$GTS  - Beautiful, gorgeous, and amazing trend up right near 200EMA and support?! Love it.

$OSW  - Same play but we have a lower high which possible is making a triangle. Either way -- this is a gorgeous run up I want to jump into.

$VGR  - We have the same elements as $GTS but the trend has NOT survived 3 times so we have to be quicker to cut when we need to.

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"I analyzed 66,000+ buy and sell recommendations made by financial analysts over the last 10 years. Here are the results. **Preamble:** I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/put-price-investment-research-2/) Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs charges $30K for access to its basic research, JP Morgan $10K per report, and Barclays charging up to $455K for its equity research package.

What I wanted to know was if you actually pay for the reports and then follow their recommendations, would you be able to beat the market in the long run? Surprisingly, there were no trackers following the performance of analyst picks over the long term and I decided to build one.

**Where is the data from:** Yahoo Finance. I used yfinance API to pull all the analyst recommendations made from 2011 for S&P500 companies. While this is in no way a complete list of recommendations, I felt that the data I had was deep enough for the analysis. Both Bloomberg and Quandl provide richer data but costs more than $20K for their subscription and also won’t allow you to share the recommendations with the public. (I have shared all the recommendations and my analysis in an Excel Sheet at the end)

**Analysis:** There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies. Following is the split of recommendations. 

|Rating |\# of records |% of total |
|:-|:-|:-|
|Buy|35,158|52.9%|
|Hold|27,033|40.6%|
|Sell|4,041|6.1%|
|Others (Cautious, Speculative etc.)|284|0.4%|

 For the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.

a. One week after recommendation

b. One month after recommendation

c. One quarter after recommendation

I benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade.

**Results:**

**Performance of Buy Recommendations** 

|Avg Change in Price|Stock|SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Week|0.5%|0.3%|\+40.7%|
|One Month|1.7%|1.4%|\+23.2%|
|One Quarter|4.9%|4.0%|\+22.8%|

 Out of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods were better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analyst made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index. 

**Performance of Sell Recommendations:**

|Avg Change in Price|Stock|SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Week|0.3%|0.3%|\-7.3%|
|One Month|1.8%|1.5%|\+17.1%|
|One Quarter|5.4%|4.0%|\+36.0%|

Sell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative) 

 **Which investment banks made the best recommendations?:** 

you can find the chart [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/mznidl/oc_i_analyzed_66000_buy_and_sell_recommendations/)  

I analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley with them making more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports?**

I did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM.

**Limitations of analysis:**

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks faired.

**Conclusion:**

I started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There has been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn’t. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of asset you have under management, in this case at least $100MM!

2021-04-27 10:00:01,stocks,"Interesting that 40% of the recommendations are ""hold"", which is really the most useless recommendation.  Sell recommendations are rare (only 6% of the total in your analysis) because markets have a bullish bias long term, so a hold is a way for an analyst to avoid sticking his/her neck out by telling people to buy it while also not taking the risk of calling it a sell."
2021-04-27 11:12:36,stocks,"First of all, I apologize but I cannot see your data. The link to your Google Sheet is broken for me. This response is based on the information you presented in your post here.

I disagree with how you are presenting the difference between SPY and the recommendations. You are presenting percentage difference in percentages, which needlessly inserts bias based on the movement of the baseline over the test period -- which here is movement of SPY. If SPY moves only a tiny bit (say 0.1%), but the recommended stock moves up 2.1%, your approach yields a 2,000% difference in return. But say for another stock recommendation test period the SPY moves up 0.5%, and the recommended stock moves up 2.5%. Now your approach says that there is a 400% difference in return.

But both stock picks returned a profit of 2% of capital invested above what the SPY would have returned. Is the first pick really 5x better than the second?"
2021-04-27 09:42:24,stocks,Isn't is more interesting to look at longer time periods than a quarter? Or are they specifically short-term recommendations? This data may possibly mostly show the impact of analyst statements on stocks instead of their relation to stock intrinsic value.

2021-04-27 17:34:29,stocks,"I did the same analysis at my former workplace (where I had access to Bloomberg data) and got a **null result** for being able to profit from recommendations. The biggest takeaway on my research was that you have to very carefully consider the timing of the recommendations. They're usually posted after market close, and around earnings, and in general they're echoing the sentiment after the financial forms drop. The big problem is the market already incorporates the price jump before the first opening trade, so there's no way you can actually capture that 1% predictive difference to the SP500. The effect you found completely disappears if you benchmark from the market open price **after** the recommendations get posted."

What I take away from this, and please do correct me if I'm wrong, is that it doesnt matter if a analyst thinks something is a sell or a buy, what matters is that the stock is being talked about. Good or bad. Doesn't matter what they say. As long as they talk about it, the price goes up. Yes?"
2021-04-27 14:34:23,stocks,"So basically they drop a buy rating on stocks they already have...drop a hold rating on stocks they have no interest in, and drop a sell rating on stocks they don't have but want, driving the price down temporarily where they then open a position."

2021-04-27 11:53:59,stocks,"keep in mind guys that when you make so many trades you sell, and thus pay taxes a LOT more than DCA'ing into an index fund of S&P if you had to sell half of your stocks, your % increase basically just got cut in half. You need to significantly beat the market to out pace index fund investing. Not saying it's impossible, but know what your 'baseline' really is, assuming your not trading in a roth or something."
2021-04-27 12:27:49,stocks,"So then, the strategy looks to become:

* If an analyst says buy, then buy it ASAP, sell after a week.
* If an analyst says sell, wait a week, buy it, then sell after a quarter."
2021-04-27 11:21:01,stocks,"Not an ad but some analyst houses are cutting it. Finnish Inderes follows Finnish stocks. They have a model portfolio. No paper trading. Started with 50,000€ of real money at June 2006. From there it has gained 950% while OMX CAP GI has gained 200%. I don't know how the dividends are handled though. Portfolio has a rule that if Inderes upgrades recommendation of a company, the stock can be added to model portfolio after two days. So it does not have any benefit of getting information before others.

At least to me the portfolio is a legit proof that they know their job. Wiser investors should check it out themselves.

2021-04-27 11:58:56,stocks,"Lol this analysis looks at one quarter as the longest time period for comparison against SPY, and in ""conclusions"" OP says this proves you can beat the market over the long term.
One quarter is not long term. Do this analysis for periods of 10, 15 & 20 years and the results will look very different."
2021-04-27 13:07:04,stocks,"I track analysts recommendations for every stock I own. 

I pay special attention to price targets & ratings from analysts who are experts in their fields, and also investment firms who can move markets with their recommendations (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morningstar, KBW, CFRA, Stifel).

It is very interesting to look at all the analysts recommendations for any given stock. They can be all over the map. But seeing that is in itself interesting. 

If one is using Schwab, many of the analysts recommendations are provided free in the Research/News tab on the computer version."

2021-04-27 15:14:57,stocks,"You should compare to the ""market""  that is VT.  SPY is flawed and lags the actual market due to its predetermined inclusion/exclusion bump of stocks.

They made big money.  Who did they take it from?  Gramma's annuity that is tied to the SPY.  NEVER EVER invest in or use SPY for anything other than a scam against poor and uneducated."

2021-04-27 17:13:27,stocks,"I just wanted to chime in as an analyst and talk about equity research and it’s end all purpose. 

While the equity research reports are expensive for your average joe, if you are a company and you trade with the firm you generally get access to the research platform complementary (not in the EU). 

The primary users of the research are buyside analysts, hedges, etc... who really are paying for the industry knowledge and sentiment on the stock. For example, I run a hedge fund and buy Ford and after earnings I want to check against how I felt so I can read the report and talk to the analyst. Equity really serves as a service to give buysiders more info and drive trading revenue. 

That’s also why most calls are buy/hold because it’s tough to sell a sell to someone."

2021-04-27 18:45:50,stocks,"First off, you should be comparing returns to the equal weighted index $RSP, because you mostly have tickers from the S&P 500 but you are weighting them all equally.

Second, you have a heavy survival bias. You have twice as much data from 2020 as you have from any other year. 

Thirdly, you have a heavy tech bias. The FANG stocks have twice as many ratings as any other stock on average.

I factored all that out and got almost exactly the same result that you did. I tried lognormal returns and the difference was even more pronounced.

The only other thing I noticed was that JP Morgan Chase has [significantly more recommendations](https://www.marketbeat.com/ratings/by-issuer/jmp-securities-stock-recommendations/) than you list out.

This doesn’t happen often but it’s well-known within the industry. It’s best to actually read the report instead of the headers. Pure ER firms or buy side ER is more reliable since there’s little conflict."

Not necessarily. If you have access to premarket trading, you can absolutely get those returns. I did not mention that this should be done by the average retail traders. Plus If I did not care about accuracy and was not bothered about bullshitting, why would I share all my datasets used in the analysis.

&#x200B;

>BTW, You want to subtract the benchmark from the measured performance like normal people.

This won't show you the actual impact of the returns. Eg. You invested $1000. With analyst recommendations you would get a weekly profit of $5 and SPY would give you $3 as profit. This implies the difference in profit in the trade you made is 40%.

&#x200B;

>Also, your SPY average performances don't check out. SPY beginning 2011: $127.05, Yesterday: $417.61 = 328.7%

I did not understand your point here. I have shared the excel sheet with benchmarking for all the spy data (The raw data). Do check it and get back to me in case you found any discrepancies rather than doing some back-of-the-envelope calculation and accusing my calculation of being wrong.

For lots of reasons analyst recommendations are virtually worthless."
2021-04-27 16:00:49,stocks,"Okay, but here's an interesting dilemma.  If the recommendations are longer term in nature, a ""hold"" basically means ""we don't think this stock will appreciate in price in the future.""  If they thought the stock did have potential to increase in price, they would recommend it as a buy.  But if the stock is fairly priced and expected to go nowhere, why wouldn't it just be a sell?  Where's the value in holding a stock that won't appreciate in price (good dividends aside)?  Might as well sell it and buy something that is expected to appreciate in price.  From the investor's point of view there may be tax implications to selling, but that's not the concern of the analyst.  From their perspective, there's really only two outcomes that matter: either a stock is expected to appreciate in price or it isn't."

Is it the open, close? The day they make the recommendations or the next day?

I know that Cramer has a show at 6pm, so if will be at the open the day after."

As a case example, one analyst has been maintaining a sell rating on Peloton for a bit now, basically giving them the P/E ratio as other gym equipment companies to come to a target.

The one who bought the stock ends up with $10,031.94 and the one who invested in SPY ends up with $10,034.44. The one in the stock ends up about $2.50 behind the one who invested in SPY, which is about 0.025% of the capital invested. It's really a small difference.

And yeah, I can elaborate. What OP is doing is presenting percentages of percentages, which have a strong upward bias in circumstances where the baseline is relatively stable.

Say you have two analysts who both beat SPY by 2% over a period of three months. However, though the periods are the same length, they are different actual dates. During the first analyst's prediction period, SPY went up by 0.1%, so that analyst's stock pick actually increased by 2.1% (beating SPY by 2.0%). During the second analyst's prediction period, SPY went up by 0.5%, meaning that pick increased by 2.5%. I think most people would say the two picks were about equally good. However, using the approach in this analysis, the first analyst beat SPY by 2,000% while the second beat SPY by 400%, which implies that the first pick was 5x better than the second. But I'd argue that's misleading."

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"What is going on with stock valuation right now? Tl;dr I want to buy stocks but everything has a P/E ratio double that of what is historically normal, what is going on and why are value ETFs long on so many overvalued positions?

Hey all, newbie question here:

I’m new to investing and learning the basics of stock valuation. The way I understand it, you start by looking at a company’s price to earnings ratio, or P/E. From moneychimp.com:

> Although discounted cash flows is the correct way to value a company, people naturally like to use simpler rules of thumb. The P/E ratio is the most popular because it's easy to understand. **If you buy stock at a P/E ratio of 15, say, then it will take 15 years for the company's earnings to add up to your original purchase price - 15 years to ""pay you back"".** That's assuming that the company is already in its ""mature"" stage, where earnings are constant.

It goes on to say that you may want to buy at a high PE ratio if you expect earnings to keep increasing. 

My understanding is also that the average P/E ratio historically has been somewhere in the ballpark of 13-15. Anything below that, all other fundamentals being equal, is considered a healthy buy.

Now I’m looking into large cap ETFs (I don’t have any positions yet) and checking the valuation of their top holdings and.... I’m seeing P/E ratios *way above* the historical average. Just some examples from this morning:

AAPL: 36.42

GOOG: 37.20

MSFT: 38.96

WMT: 29.06

JNJ: 28.99

AMZN: 81.51 ?!!

TSLA: 1,158.65 ??!!?!

I get that the highest values here are tech, which may have a strong expectation to keep growing, but Tesla with a P/E ratio in the thousands? Is this normal? Is this the result of massive money printing going straight to Wall Street and inflated stock prices relative to consumer goods (and thus relative to earnings)? What is going on? Thanks in advance."

2021-04-27 08:57:16,stocks,A high P/E ratio often tells you how optimistic people are with the future of the company. The insane P/E of Tesla just indicates that people expect the company to have big growth in the future. Growth stocks have a high P/E because you have to pay a premium for the growth.
2021-04-27 09:08:21,stocks,"There is a lot of talk about the markets being in a bubble, especially when it comes to tech. 

I'm not going to go into whether or not it actually is a bubble, since that's a different discussion, but no one would disagree that many companies, such as the ones OP has listed, are trading at what is **historically** considered pretty overvalued. 

You can't stare too much at a single metric, though. P/E is useful, but you have to consider it in the wider context of a given company's financials and market share. Low P/E can lead to investing into a value trap, i.e. it looks cheap but there's still a reason for it being cheap. 

Now, given high P/E values, it doesn't mean the price of a given stock can't appreciate even more. Regardless of how justified or irrational you consider those valuations, the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

Historically speaking, current valuations aren't exactly normal. There are many reasons for this, including but not limited to: tech is booming, liquidity, money that should be in bonds find their way into stocks, meme/hype. But what is normal? The markets have never been exactly ""normal"". It's possible we're looking at a wider paradigm shift here and that's the cause for current valuations. 

I'm not invested in any of the companies that OP mentions."
2021-04-27 09:02:25,stocks,"There are several factors:

1. Low interest rates. Interest rates are half (or less) of what they used to be just a few years ago. Even junk bond rates are crazy low, so if you want to invest in bonds or other investments you aren't going to get much return on investment. Factor in inflation and you might as well be lighting your money on fire - this forces more people into the stock market.
2. These companies are valued with high P/E ratios because of growth or growth potential.
3. P/E ratio isn't a great metric to value companies that are investing in capital and R&D.  You will need to look at other metrics if you want to properly value these companies.


On a completely unrelated note I think a company like Amazon is currently grossly undervalued and will likely go up another 20-30% this year, while Tesla is very much overvalued. I'm not betting against Tesla though, because Tesla fanboys can stay irrational longer than I can stay liquid."

Also, including Tesla (or any other company that's growing production at 100% annually while improving margins) in a trailing P/E list is just silly. ;)"
2021-04-27 16:47:46,stocks,"1.Interest rates are low. Generally when valuing a company's earnings you use a discount rate to discount the value of future earnings. Lower discount rates = higher P/E ratio being justified.

If you adjust for interest rates and M2 supply, valuations really aren't that excessive.

2. PE Ratios are based on the past 12 months, which obviously were quite bad. Investors are valuing equities based on forward earnings, which have much lower eatios."
2021-04-27 08:53:04,stocks,Why do you want to buy stocks?
2021-04-27 12:19:44,stocks,"I think its silly to simply take a p/e or any p/X ratio and broad scope just find the average of all stocks. Its worthless. You need to view ratios within a context of industry, historical ratios of the company, etc. I suggest you find the company’s historical average and use that compared to their growth rate. So for p/e consider this for GOOG...

P/e historical avg over last 5 years is approx 32. They are at 39 right now. So take their eps growth rate of 28% (avg over 5 years) and see where they might be at in the next 5. Then try and dumb down the projection a bit to be a little conservative. The answer is that GOOG stock will be somewhere around 6-7K in 5 years provided the same company performance is equal. A good investment."
2021-04-27 14:43:57,stocks,People put more money in the last 5 months than the last 12 years (11 years prior to Covid was the longest bull run in history) That will definitely create a bubble.

PE Ratio is only relevant for long-term investing or most stocks for old people. Proof is most of last year, you're more likely to make money by researching hidden gems and entering before the hype smoothens out. Stocks don't trade on fundamentals anymore, but more on meme status and popular demand."
2021-04-27 14:51:05,stocks,"Keep in mind if earnings come in where analysts believe they will, the S&P will be trading at a forward PE of 22. Sure, that's still above the historical average, but we are still in a low rate environment. Until fixed income is worth owning, you aren't going to see PEs fall.


Additionally, it's hard to value growth stocks by their PEs alone. You're still seeing big tech growing as high as 30-40% YoY. Tesla is an outlier and no one seems to know how to value that company."

2021-04-27 15:46:38,stocks,"> t's possible we're looking at a wider paradigm shift here 

I believe this is the most likely case. It's the natural next step to decades of the stock market being pushed as the only place to store money to make money. All of our retirements are bound up with the stock market, all of our societal wealth is tied up in the market. Everyone ""knows"" that the market is the end all be all of wealth creation and sustaining. 

There was a lot of distrust early on, then ""The Crash"" that took a long time for people to get over. But now, we dropped 35% in two weeks and two months later we are at ATH. We as a society have decided to drop every red blooded cent into the market and as a result the market keeps growing."

2021-04-27 19:17:15,stocks,I absolutely agree on the paradigm shift here. There is absolutely way more money being pumped in the equity marrtket. Also I think the P/E ratio of 15 is when a company is dependent on domestic sales. The 10-K does not effectively show overseas sales due to companies trying to cut corporate taxes IMO. So I think the big company these days just show enough growth to beat estimates. This is all speculation but reading through 10-k regulations got me thinking that there is a loop hole to be used.

I try to think of an industry I'd like to get involved with, and then I google companies within that industry. After that, I start digging into financials for those companies, and based on value investing principles, I try to find out if some of them are trading below what I think their intrinsic value is.

Value investing is a time-tested approach to investing, but it takes time to do your DD on those companies. The usual book recommendations are Benjamin Graham's ""The Intelligent Investor"". In order to learn how to analyze stocks, I usually suggest to learn the basics of financial accounting and taking it from there. 

There are thousands of companies listed on NYSE. Few people have analyzed all of them, but if you list them all on a spreadsheet and pick one at random, chances are you'll land on a ticker you've never heard of."

There are some talented Redditors here who will literally analyze stocks and provide DD on undervalued stocks. Of course, I look into it myself and decide whether I agree with their analysis or not. 

The important thing is to look for undervalued sectors and assets that nobody is talking about or even wants to consider buying. This is the key to buying early and then just patiently waiting for institutions and mainstream to hop on aboard. Obviously this requires some speculation and luck. Also, once I'm convinced that I've found an opportunity, I will take a small position and follow the company like a hawk (any news, what people are saying, etc) and continue to build upon that.

2021-04-27 12:56:32,stocks,"It's increasingly difficult. We live in an information era. It used to be that you considered exiting a stock once 8 or 10 analysts were on it. Now there are often that many near the IPO. 

One screening tool I utilize is to simply look for stocks with low valuations and high earnings relative to those valuations. Joel Greenblatt operates magicformulainvesting.com. While I disagree with Greenblatt's methodology of just blindly choosing stocks, the list that is provided is nothing but companies with low valuations for their industries and recent histories of high earnings. 

Then through that screening tool, I apply lessons taught by Peter Lynch. I look for any companies or industries I might have special knowledge of. Most of the list will be companies that justifiably have low valuations because something is wrong. Once in a while, very rarely, you'll see a company where you are banging your head wondering why people are so foolish to value it so inexpensively. Those are your rare opportunities.

Then it's having the balls to put your money on it. Early on small losses of even a few thousand dollars is absolutely devastating to long term success. That means most of us won't put much money down even when we see something that is nearly assured.

As Warren Buffet says, ""Really successful people say no to almost everything"". When you screen, the usual outcome should be that you don't find a deal. If you do find the deal of a lifetime, seize it. If you develop special knowledge of industries and screen enough you eventually will. In the meantime it is important to keep investing in the total market or sectors of your choosing."

Huge company, like 80bn mcap.

For the most part I stay away from small and mega caps since the former are too unpredictable and the latter too stagnant, but there have been a couple of exceptions (e.g. Vestas and Abbott Labs).

Ideally you find a mid-cap that can become a large cap or a large cap that can become a mega cap due to strong growth (both typically at lower P/Es compared to peers) and buy them when they're down significally due to unrelated or exaggerated news (e.g. Discover last year dropped dramatically on the credit loss reserves build that they didn't wind up needing).

Of course, at the time, their stock price was getting hammered by COVID so once I figured out there was no chance at all of bankruptcy, and how well locations were doing prior, it was a no brainer.

That was just luck plus normal due diligence.

Another one was Enphase. It was all over the news when that short report was published last year. It was also beat up by market forces and beat again by the report. I know a ton of about solar because I do installs for friend and family so for me, the DD was super easy and I could tell the short report was total fiction. I bought a bunch and at the time while it was still a midcap around $40.

Again, just chance. I just happened to read the news about the short report.

This happens all the time if you just stay alert. Back in the financial crash there was a huge effort to figure out what companies will survive. It was easy for me, years of experience in real estate, and i ended up buying tons of hard asset real estate companies, especially residential (rent goes up when people lose homes... gotta live somewhere) and government back mortgage stuff.

2021-04-27 16:21:07,stocks,"It seems like a lot of the replies to this thread are implying that investors choose stocks completely at random and people posting DD/gains is just an effect of that randomness.

But that's not the case and I think that is more a reflection of the investing attitude of the people posting those replies.

For example I've been building up my position on M V I S since it was $2. I did this by finding a massive 40+ list fo companies in the EV marketplace and doing a bit of research on all of them. I decided the LIDAR space was an emerging market, found three LIDAR companies that seemed relevant (LAZR, VLDR, M V I S) and had a position in all three. I ended up exiting my positions in LAZR and VLDR close to their peaks once I decided that M V I S was the most undervalued of the three.

I did have some gains/losses in other EV companies as well (GOEV, TSLA, C C I V, etc) but as I cut losses/secured gains and adjusted my portfolio I continued to grow my position in M V I S and I've been all in on them for about a month now with an average PPS of $10.

For me the process began by picking a sector (EV), breaking it down by subsector (LIDAR), and researching the companies in that field."

Also, Stocktwits. See what people tag along with their main post and what's trending. 

Two kinds of stocks I like: ones with good fundamentals priced at a discount to their peers, and ones that are leaders that continue to go up because they're excellent and outperform and are riding the coattails of secular tailwinds (many mixed metaphors there lol)

The sector is going to turn to other things very quickly in about a year or so, so find what's undervalued there through research. You have a year. I'm personally a big believer in B  N  G  O even though people try to down play it, my wife has a doctorate in BioChemistry and has worked in a genome lab. She says they are the real deal when dealing with certain genome related diagnostics. Another I just saw yesterday that I'm reading more into is R  D  G  L. It's a penny stock. They have a new gel injection for treating targeted cancer areas and it's looking great. They are approved for use in vet clinics in animals and are trying to get it human approved. They are working directly with the Mayo Clinic. Working directly with them is not only what you need to do for fast approval, it's hard to do. They are using a new Yttrium-90 compound that's not as long lasting in the body, blah, blah science stuff that's too long for this post. Read into them. Just their revenue from vet clinics should push them close to $2 and they are at 9 cents a share now. Grabbed almost 50,000 shares yesterday just in case.

But yeah, constant research, and look at fields that no one else is looking into, eventually people will look and if you're there first you make the money.

I think there’s no right and wrong answer, it’s different for everyone and you quickly learn what works for you and what doesn’t. It only takes you one time to lose $1000 to not make a rash choice or use thin info again.
  
Some sub Reddit’s are good, some discord groups, some Twitter accounts, lots of news outlets like Bloomberg, Barron’s and Reuters. But I think the best approach is using ALL the resources at your disposal, cross check everything and research claims or opinions you find in one outlet on all the rest.
  
Those people that bought a stock you never heard of and now it’s a winner, probably fall into two categories. Either they found some info and did a lot of cross research and decided to invest and have been holding it long because they believe in it, or they saw an opinion and were able to time something right without any research and hit on a stock before a big catalyst.

Momentum is actually a pretty significant factor in returns. You could've bought all the dips in sears and lost a ton of money.

Secondly, with Nvidia, Microsoft, etc, if you bought them when up and held instead of selling early when up a few bucks, you would still have a high return.

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"CD PROJECT RED ANALYSIS & THEORYCRAFT CD PROJEKT RED ANALYSIS & THEORYCRAFT

There seems to be a lot of opinion on CDR (Warsaw) aka OTGLY (ADR) so I figured I would throw mine into the wild as well. This is mostly bullish and I do hold a very small position so obviously, I am biased. I posted this in another thread prior but someone pointed out that its probably good enough to get its own, so here it is. Feel free to correct my numbers or point out material stuff I may have missed.

Not all comparisons are apples to apples. They are just used to help me quantify things in a way so that I can make a valuation call.

Here is my analysis:

1. They have about 1100 workers now
   1. Witcher 3 only had 250
   2. CP2077 had 400 by release
   3. Supposedly about 50 work on app stuff and another 100 on online games
   4. .. do the math... A lot of missing workers who havent been seen in a long time. Where are they?
2. The  last presentation stated clearly that they will be working on 2 AAA  games in parallel by 2022 and they wanted to push more into mobile and  side stuff thought they didnt elaborate on this.
   1. Odds are they already are working on the next AAA if you are following the logic from #1 above.
3. CP2077  sold 14m copies by end of last year... this is far from failure as some people have claimed. In  fact it was extremely profitable and they had their best year in company  history.
   1. It only did poorly on consoles but most of those sales are on PC where the game was playable from day 1 and was no more or less buggy than any other big open world game.
4. Their current PE is about 16... granted its very cyclical due to release times but even so, that is extremely low and see points 1 and 2 above. It seems that the cyclicality time frame is about to get reduced or possibly normalized with other products.
5. Witcher as a franchise alone, is probably worth more than $4b by itself.
   1. What is the VG brand worth? It has global recognition now.
   2. It has enormous sales. Witcher 3, alone, sold 30m copies. Lets say average $15 net each overall gives us a net profit of $450m.
      1. Total rev is probably north of $2b.
      2. This is just Witcher 3... what about the other related games?
   3. The  only issue with net/revenue is timing. If its once per 5 years, its not  so great but thats simply a function of the company who owns it, not of  the franchise itself. At a bigger company, there is no reason why they  cant leverage scale to do a yearly release of some sort, be it offshoots  or major expansions.
      1. Clearly, CDR has already realized this hence the huge employment push.
   4. Now some perspective.
      1. The last 5 Star Wars films, grossed about $1.3b worldwide each. Their net combined was reported to be $1.8 or about $350m each. Now obviously, SW makes money in other ways as well so its not apples to apples, but the point here is that Witcher games are likely to outperform SW movies and no, the movies are not cheaper to make. They cost about more than $250m each. Witcher 3 was reported to cost $265m.
      2. Total sales of Witcher 3 rival those of COD (2019), Diablo 3+extras, & Skyrim.
6. Their profit margins are higher than most other companies due to their own  publishing & marketing platform at GOG. So there is a good chance the average net is higher than I listed.
   1. GOG  is the #2 publisher outside of consoles. That has to be worth something  to someone. Even though it doesnt generate much profit yet, it has a good reputation and is generally preferred over all the competitors not named Steam. That has to be worth north of $2b if not more for the customer install base alone.
      1. Growth here should be good going forward because it is decoupled from their own releases specifically.
      2. They  seem to be pushing to innovate the platform. Its needed and it also  means that there might be a lot more profit to be made here down the line.
   2. Sales are still trending to digital sales. Digital sales are more profitable so future releases are likely to have better margins.
7. I honestly dont think their reputation will be hurt by CP2077. I think thats a reach by highly emotional people. Will people not buy Elder Scrolls because the last 2 Fallouts sucked? ... come on... not a chance. I cant wait for it myself despite knowing that they will keep dumbing it down for masses. Thank goodness for mods. And mind you, FO76 was far worse than CP2077 at release.
   1. Further, CDR handled the problem like professionals. They didnt just laugh and walk away.
8. The one thing I dont like about CDR is their Polish local. Poland is known to be more corrupt than other EU nations but AFAIK, that seems to be isolated to a few specific corporations, namely in the energy sector. It is still EU and corruption exists everywhere so I take it on a case to case basis. CDR has been around a long time. So far, I dont know of any government issues with them.
   1. On the plus side. Wages in Poland for devs is incredibly cheap compared to the USA... software devs average sub USD $2000/mo.... yes thats not a typo. Thats how much journeymen in development make in Poland. Obviously cost of living there is far lower too so thats probably why. But since they sell their game globally, thats a big competitive advantage.

So IMHO, Witcher + GOG alone are probably worth north of $6b... the  company right now is valued below $5b (USD)... Thus, right now, this seems like the  gem of the gaming industry. I cant imagine that other gaming companies arent eyeing it for buyout but CDR has stated in the past that its not interested. That was a long time ago so I dont know the current status.

Also my $6b valuation assumes Cyberpunk is worth $0... 14m copies sold  mostly on PC is no joke. Release cycles are also about to get cut in  half. See point 1 and 2 above.

Last, I think there is a good chance we will see a AAA release next year or early 2023. I would be  surprised otherwise because, again, about 500 employees are MIA right  now and have been for about 2 years.... what are they doing?

Other rev  streams will include CP2077 on consoles bringing in some extra cash, DLC  after that, and some other smaller projects and of course, whatever  they make at GOG which is profitable right now though not a big cash  maker yet."

CDPR were hit by allegations that they forced their staff to undergo crunch time - the practice of having your staff working from 40 hours a week to 50 - 100 hours. There has been a lot of anger in the larger gaming community towards studios that carry out this practice.

CDPR is in Poland, hiring 100+ people \*in gamedev\* over a quarter is nothing short of a miracle. We don't have that many people here. We're talking mid+ seniority here. Relocation would no go for many people, and then there's covid (and Poland isn't doing well in that department either). Add on top the CP2077 fiasco. Who would drop their stuff and go work there among the PR shitstorm they're still in?

Even if, these people need to be managed, and CDPR isn't historically known for good management (and new managers need to be onboarded etc, etc).

If you think that doubling the workforce equals halving the release cycles, you're kinda out of your depth when it comes to the inner workings of gamedev. Especially, paired with CDPRs notorius self-awe, ambition, and disregard for employees' opinion.

A loss leader is very different. Its a product or service that companies offer to entice customers to buy their product or service. Kind of like time shares who give you a free vacation or a car company that does raffles. GOG obviously sells products for others (not just themselves) and makes a profit from said sales. By definition, its not a loss leader unless you consider all marketing a loss leader.

GoG allows them to self publish without the 30% cut you need to face elsewhere. That in itself, is worth it. Otherwise its just a matter of scale like with any other software business. It costs money to develop and maintain but at a certain point, it becomes highly scalable and profitable."

Why would a hack damage reputation? They arent a bank. There is no financial information int here nor any real way to use the code to get said financial data. The codes were likely changed the instant they discovered the hack.

Also the hack stole video game code... which is totally and utterly worthless (lol). Its not like they stole a patented invention. Nor can anyone re-use the code in any productive way to compete. The value in their code isnt in the code itself. Its in the people who wrote it. This is why software companies try to hire employees away from competitors. The value is in the workers."

Dunno about the respect thing. Why would you need to respect a brand new worker with no history? Also doubt you turned them down. Your reasoning ability is too poor to be a developer. 

If you double the workers it means can work on 2 project at once. It doesnt matter if dev times are the same per project, you still have double the number of releases assuming similar scope/scale of projects. 

Does that logic sound like something a programmer would have missed? No. If you are a programmer and you didnt see that logic, then how can you possibly understand algorithms and data structures to pass a interview?

Digital Scapes in Canada had about 10 employees... 

What fiasco? LoL they had a product that sold 14 million copies. What company hasnt had PR problems at some point in their history? No one looking for work is going to care about the PR problem.

That's, well, two new employees for each one already there, which need to be interviewed, discussed, culture-fitted, etc. And that's only ready matches. Imagine the deluge of CVs you'd need to go through to even start on picking people. Imagine the amount of planning required to have jobs for these people on their first day. You don't do a pre-prod phase of any game with 700 people. Ramping up to 70 in pre-prod can take up to a year. Seasoned developers who started a new product, were decent enough with their skills to be let anywhere near team building and recruitment would know that.   


Their culture change, where they 'embrace more agile ways of work' got me chuckling for a while. This basically means that everything was micromanaged, went on status reports and other low-tier bullshit. Command & control without trust for their own teams. Gamedev is not a sweatshop, and you don't do creative stuff like that. If they do transform more towards Agile, good for them. It will take 1-2 years, and for the love of god I do hope they'll stay away from SAFe. As a seasoned dev you understand the difference between SAFe and Scrum, so I'm not going into details here.

The PR fiasco for their recruitment is pretty massive. Toxic work culture, overtime, burnout, management circlejerk and disregard for the team's opinion and creative vision. It sold 14m copies before all of this came to light. It sold 8m of these copies before anyone saw the game. Their street cred in local gamedev ain't as stellar as you'd think, and wasn't promising building up to the release, but you're a foreigner so what would you know.

Among some crazy-ass bears and bulls, there's some solid DD done by the mods here. Again, you'd need a google translate.

Full disclosure: I have CP2077, played 100h+ so far, like the game, I'm invested in their stock (WSE, not some ADR bullshit), and my average is way above what I'm comfortable with right now. But they're not the holy grail of game development, culture or work/life balance. They always aim too high, and their pride doesn't allow them to learn from mistakes. That's how 2077 crumbled."

>I would, however, need a source on that +700 employees uptick in the last quarter, as I strongly doubt that would be humanly possible to process through HR, onboard, etc. 

Who said the upstick in workers was in a quarter? It was over the past couple of years. That was part of the point when I said they have been MIA for a long time...

Your producer comment is also not making sense. I dont know about them specifically, but producers in the game space are generally older devs unless you work in a company making something not very technical. I know some companies do this, and thats fine. 

In most studios, producer are in charge of several dev teams but if you suck at dev, you will suck at that too because A) you need to review code, B) sometimes you need to step in and C) you are usually part of the hiring panel of experts. If you were not a dev prior, you will suck at producing. 

I was a senior producer prior to my current job but I made simulations for the military rather than public games. After I retired, I moved to gaming because it is what I love to do plus the producer job was eating too much time and I started a family and what not.

The style of management is not point of concern if it works. Agile vs traditional vs whatever is all just Project Management certification lingo and it almost never applies in reality. Its garbage talk kind of like how business people love to talk about ""value added"" lol.  

We had ""agile"" style management all the way back in the 90s in various engineering fields. People didnt call it ""agile"" at the time and frankly no one really follows the agile books anyway because its just a guideline, not a rule. There is no company that doesnt already have elements of ""agile"" in their management already and no ""agile"" company that doesnt have some transitional methods either. 

Also, micromanagement still happens in Agile... I have no idea what you mean by that. That is literally the entire point to the producer. If everyone simply did everything right on their own, there would be no need for a producer to begin with and all you need is a Director at the higher level. Also, agile doesnt mean more trust. Being more self directed doesnt mean more trust. It just means you will get checked at a different point in the process and I have seen this lead to catastrophe in the past.

Regarding being foreign and not ""understanding"" you Polish people. Man please. Im from Iraq... Want to know what I learned as being a foreigner everywhere I go? People are the same everywhere. Street cred is nonsense when it comes to jobs. People need to eat. Again, please point me in the direction of a video game related company that hasnt had bad releases in their history? Ill wait. Microsoft? LoL. Sony? Dont make me laugh. Nintendo? nope. Bethesda? Nope. TTWO? Nope. Blizzard? Nope. And yet, here we are and people still work there and buy their games."

2021-04-27 12:59:17,stocks,"Exactly, at least in the foreseeable future, caring about crunch is moral signalling. Shit, rockstar might be one of the most notorious crunch studios and all talk about it was lost in the wind. Any mention now is of how solid their games are."
2021-04-27 18:32:27,stocks,"You said '1100' now, 400 by release. The release was Q4, so the delta here is 1100-400. I guess english is not our first language.

It seems you're pretty misguided for a seasoned dev what producers do, and what is their career path or skillset. Not touching code, even when I had the skills to do that was literally the first thing I've learned on this job.

The style of management is actually everything. You say 'if it works'. Works how? Works for whom? Is 'completing tasks' enough? If I manufacture enough lego bricks will they build me a castle when I shake the bag hard enough?

I do understand your point of view though. Being in the military, making military simulators - command and control, rigid specs, recreating reality with precision. Creative industries are a bit different. It's not about being ruthlessly efficient, but about having room to breathe in order to come up with a killer concept.

This also shows with your understanding of what Agile is, how it should be understood and applied. I don't blame you personally, I've had a lot of people who simply 'grew up' in companies which were full of bad and misunderstood practices. It takes a couple of years in different companies to see many perspectives and to understand what things should / can / could look like.

I said you're a foreigner, so you have no clue how the job market works here. You don't know what the sentiment is for this or that company, because you're not on this scene. Not an argument, just a fact.

Street cred is actually pretty important in creative industries. The best people want to work with the best companies, the most renowned companies. For the top talent putting food on a table is not a concern, they usually have people waiting for them with new opportunities.  
CDPR had that going for themselves until about 2019. They've announced no crunch as a publicity stunt, and now they had to eat their own hat, coming out as hypocrites.  
You don't hire people 'off the street' to do games. If putting food on the table is one's main concern, then their gamedev/IT career must've taken a wrong turn somewhere or they're still in uni.

Do other companies have bad releases? Hell yeah. It took 'fallout 76' years to come into good terms with players, same for no man's sky. And NMS is a good example here, because they TOO have lied and bloated expectations about their game. But the NMS guys were sort of 'nobodies' at that time.  
CDPR was at the top of their game, sitting in their ivory tower of great games with great story and no DRM, no crunch time, release when it's done, etc. The marketing campaign was great, and preorders have shown that. But they fell off their high horse and are now just 'another game company'. That stain will be there for years.

Back to the merit:

\- They will do great games in the future

\- Trend is not helping them. RSI, Stoch RSI are falling, MACD goes sideways. 

\- There's a high chance to double-triple your money (if you buy today) in mid term (5+ years) with some peaks and dips along the way

\- In short term it will keep going down/sideways

\- The only catalyst ahead is the PS Store return and then the next-gen version, which will probably not surprise anyone who has played the game on a decent PC

\- Going to 150-120 PLN is very much on the table

I'm some 40% in red on their stock, so I'm just going to HODL. Would I like them to do well? Hell yes. Is the reality looking like it? Not so much.  


PS. I'm sorry for the fact that americans bombed your country. Must be a terrible thing. I was fortunate enough to not experience war, but the fallout of WW2 and later transitions of power is felt in the society here. Must be much much harder for everyone in the middle east."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Just hoping someone less stupid can explain this to me and correct what is likely a misunderstanding:

Say a stock normally has a volume of 3 million a day and has a trading price range in the past 6 months of let's say $10-15. Currently it trades for $14. Suddenly, a large market sell order for 6 million stocks comes in (fat fingers or a stupid pension fund, your choice); more than the typical volume. This order should fill all buy orders on the order book until all shares that need to be sold are sold, if I am correct. As such, the stock low price for the day is suddenly around $11 (for a brief moment). As this happens in an instant, the price of the stock from day-start to day-end is not impacted and the stock closes not far off from $14, as the market continues to submit buy and sell orders around the same point it was at before this momentary blip.

Is this understanding of how that scenario would play out correct? Consequently, if one found a stock where on a semi-annual basis large market orders (either on the sell or buy side) took place and momentarily dipped the price, would it be a viable idea to place a limit order substantially below the current trading price and wait? Would the order be filled (presuming there were not enough buy orders at a higher price to your limit order)?

I drive Porsche and just got their most recent email about taycan. It is sexy!  Super sexy. And starting at $75k isn’t too bad either. Reviews on their double transmission are quite impressive as well. Might be switching to it soon. 

I do think that Tesla’s satellite internet might be big though. Interesting to see how that advances.   

I have to add for the sake of disclosure that wouldn’t touch Tesla if you paid me, because I am just allergic to Elon Musk. So I might be very biased. It is literally the only individual company out there that’s on my no-touch list (in addition to the whole private prison sector)."

Pick up any books on the topic that interest you too and learn as much as possible before diving in.

You'll get a lot of people here just saying go straight to investing in funds but tbh that advice only holds for people who don't know what they're doing or don't have the desire to learn. If you have either your odds of succeeding in stock picking are probably much better than the average rate. 

You clearly want to learn and seem committed to doing the work involved so I say give it a shot. But regardless keep some indexes in tax advantaged accounts such as an IRA as a safety net so you don't blow up your retirement chances."

Aside from J&J and maybe KO, you can get all of those in a consumer discretionary ETF like FDIS. Will give you some decently heavy AMZN and TSLA exposure too but there are other consumer disc ETFs without TSLA. One without AMZN will be harder to find.

FDIS has been great for me but I plan on eventually trimming that and adding some combo of HD (or Lowe's) and SBUX because I'm already heavily weighted in AMZN and have a few TSLA shares."

2021-04-27 13:46:53,stocks,Doubtful. Markets are just often volatile and irrational. With the crazy runup the last few days I was honestly expecting a correction soon. Too many stocks gapping up with no real news to back it.

Their future is going to be about whether they convert users into long term monthly subscribers, and potentially keep feeding the user base things to do and buy.

You can review their financial statements any time. Their bikes and treadmills are just a way to provide another avenue towards their app. The revenue is high on the products, but so this the cost. Their margin is almost entirely made up out of people who use the app.

In a future world, it's very possible these machines are collecting dust and the stock also reaches 400 precisely because it's able to focus growth on the app. In other words, in today's world they ""steal"" customers from gyms like SoulCycle with necessarily expensive equipment but it's conceivable that in the future the only people who connect Peloton with indoor cycling are the same people who connect Amazon with used books."

2021-04-27 19:27:59,stocks,One thing is that Intel lost Apple partnership. AMD has had breakthrough performance
2021-04-27 19:35:23,stocks,"Simply put, Intel is not popular and AMD is. 

More specifically, though, INTC has been under pressure because it recently posted a significant decline in data center revenue last quarter. Speculation abounds that this loss was because its competitors like AMD have stolen that piece of the market away, which naturally follows if you view AMD more positively than INTC. AMD posted its quarterly and although it only beat earnings estimates by 1 cent per share after dilution, the thing that stood out is that data center sales from them have more than doubled YoY. Strangely, no one seems to care that their sales in this department are nearly flat compared to the previous quarter (I think it was ~~25M~~ 35M up in profit), but that's not as exciting as ""We doubled our sales."""
2021-04-27 05:37:54,stocks,yeaaah. run up to earnings for most of my main holdings. dis gon be gud.
2021-04-27 07:59:48,stocks,it doesn't matter. either is a good plan. what matters is sticking to said plan.
2021-04-27 07:52:46,stocks,"You're going to get fairly similar results from either one, they mirror each other for the most part. Buying into VTI gets you the entirety of VOO (it's something like 83%~ of VTI), but also gets you the diversification benefits of small and mid cap companies. That gives you a little extra volatility, but at the same time would lead to marginally better returns when small/mid caps have good runs.

VTI seems to be the general consensus these days (especially paired with VXUS), but you're on the perfect path with either one."

2021-04-27 15:55:09,stocks,"Earnings is tomorrow. Definitely expecting a slide back down to 125, even if it spikes a bit the day after.

2021-04-27 13:49:31,stocks,"> Makes you wonder how many solid plays people are missing out on by them beating on the same beaten horse, which to be fair seems to have a life and rules of its own.

That's why I have resolved to not touch GME anymore. Not only have I demonstrably proven to myself that I can't play that ticker without getting hurt, but anytime I held it, it distracted me from dozens of other opportunties that would'nt make me sleep uneasy at night. It may moon someday. It may not. But I know that my heart just can't handle the turmoil along the way. I feel like folks need to invest with a very clear understanding of their own psyche."

That's a funny way of spelling ""kilogram of salt"""
2021-04-27 15:45:01,stocks,Yeah that's ridiculous to call it like that. I remember occasionally opening Reddit before my stock app with people talking about 'bloodred day' while indices were down -0.2% when I checked the app.

Aside from semiconductor supply issues, I pointed it out in another post but I work in weather/climate for the federal government and most of our machines have run on Intel and HP (Cray) for a very long time. The previous administration didn't throw these science departments much in the way of fiscal support. With the new admin, I expect we'll be getting plenty of new computational resources to do work on disaster mitigation and climate projections. Assuming the budgetary powers care about the bottom-line, they'll be sticking with Intel for computations."
2021-04-27 07:45:42,stocks,"Ok, but as much reading as I've tried with my brain I cannot figure out how it will effect it this far out.

A theta of -.002-.003 is what I'm seeing for the 01/23 and 01/22 call options that I liked.

What does that do to the option, does it lower the stock value per share or?"

-doesn't read my comment further down, only a few lines, to see me saying ""I'm not holding""-

*sigh* maybe try reading before making aspersions, huh?"
2021-04-27 11:55:09,stocks,Good luck coming back from that. You'll need gains of 0.020004% if you want to even make it back to breakeven. You're probably best off YOLOing on TSLA calls if you ever want to breakeven again

2021-04-27 16:03:36,stocks,Thanks! I might sell half right before ER then sit on the rest as a bet
2021-04-27 11:18:45,stocks,"Yeah true on the last 12 months, but think it's really been the last 2-3 months, but especially last 1 month. I agree the up/down swing is normal, but seems like right now it's truly to the extremity of almost being a flat line we can walk on. Many stocks, for instance the average price of AMD, TSM, PayPal, has essentially stayed the same, especially AMD, which has been swinging in a flat line trajectory since last summer."

2021-04-27 15:32:36,stocks,Someone had to say it
2021-04-27 11:11:20,stocks,Wait until he sees a real market crash 😂
2021-04-27 12:22:37,stocks,Vuzi lol. To be fair it's the only really bad one. Not even sure why it's -6%
2021-04-27 08:26:44,stocks,"I like their cloud gaming idea and all their graphics cards and in high demand, higher than supply. I think that's a pretty decent reason why their stock makes sense to me? I might be wrong tho"

2021-04-27 10:52:57,stocks,"Here is the in-depth review/comparison. To me personally it is Porsche all the way, but obviously matter of preference. 

https://www.autoguide.com/car-comparisons/porsche-taycan-vs-tesla-model-s-comparison

“Extrapolating out from our test loop, the Tesla would still travel further on a single charge: the Taycan would get through 2.5 test loops before its battery was fully drained. At that point, the Tesla would still have a bit of juice, but only around 38 km (24 miles). Newer versions of the Model S go further still. The charging infrastructure is a tougher call: Tesla’s Supercharger system is vast, but it’s proprietary. The Taycan can charge at more places, but you’ll need to hunt to find 350-kW spots, at least for now. More likely, both will primarily be charged at home.

Call this one a draw.”"
2021-04-27 11:09:29,stocks,That credit market is going to disappear in the next year or two though is the problem. Stocks are forward looking and that revenue stream for Tesla is going to disappear.
2021-04-27 16:37:47,stocks,Compare it side by side with GOOG's and you will reevaluate what crush means.
2021-04-27 17:09:42,stocks,"Yeah, it dropped 20% after Cleveland Research forecasted they would miss earnings so there really was no reason for a further drop especially when they beat.  

The only concern is the monthly active user growth possibly slowing down but in my opinion that’s only enough to stop it from a big run up, that’s definitely not enough to offset the good numbers and actually cause a drop.   

The drop seems irrational to me and while it’s annoying for sure, it’s not worrying in the slightest."
2021-04-27 16:42:24,stocks,"oh today!?!?!?

cool thanks!!!!"
2021-04-27 12:52:39,stocks,This is why GME is a speculative stock. Its price is not tethered to anything
2021-04-27 13:48:29,stocks,Don't think so with the percentage that was leaked. There's no way in hell they're going to tax long term gains more than short term and leave short term untouched. All that's going to do is remove incentive to hold long and give incentive to more speculative WSB-like investing which the Biden admin already seems pretty heavily against incentivizing.
2021-04-27 13:18:11,stocks,">Edit - It always seems to happen as we enter the strongest part of the day.

Of course, he can't hurt the HFTs"
2021-04-27 16:47:44,stocks,Need this shit to get rational so I can see some green again
2021-04-27 18:44:19,stocks,"And seeing as MSFT is in the profitable category, I don’t think one needs to sweat buying their shares for 8 dollars more or less right now."
2021-04-27 08:59:59,stocks,"I mean sorry for recommending a pricey one, but there are better alternatives. Honestly I recommend because it’s what I personally have. Regardless I think the financial sector is a pretty good place to start. Hey man good luck."
2021-04-27 09:55:31,stocks,"HAHA no worries man, I hope you are right"
2021-04-27 12:45:38,stocks,"You have to give it the right perspective. If you zoom out on other boring sectors (ex: oil), you’ll see that many are also down over several years from ATHs. That’s because there was a massive shift out of these companies and into growth from investors. There are a ton of boring value stocks that are paying high divs at good deals. If you bought XOM in 2016 and held, you’re still bagholding, and that sucks. But much like MO, if you catch a value stock in a good year when it’s out of rotation and low, it can be a catch.

Don’t buy value stocks at ATHs, but for someone looking to diversify away from growth/tech, there are some major players that are reliably flooring with some runway to move up a little and the divs are nice."
2021-04-27 13:47:40,stocks,"man. I think its possibly hitting overvalued territory and would rather take my gains.

Im wanting to move to a more ETF heavy portfolio so I can not look at my stocks so much lol.

VTI and SCHD.

I still have 135 stocks in CCL and NCLH but im holding those for reopening growth.

Also want to buy some more MSFT and Apple with it."
2021-04-27 17:47:28,stocks,"Nice and green, my friend! First time I’m overall green since the tech dump. Feels good."
2021-04-27 16:42:34,stocks,"It's not about beating estimates but how much you beat it by; this is the surprise that doesn't get priced in. So there's positive which is usually expected, and then there's that kind of positive that makes analysts go into a coma. Prices tend to be somewhere in between these kinds of positives towards earnings."
2021-04-27 17:02:48,stocks,"It was already priced in. Even though it beat earnings, they priced in beating earnings and took a guess by how much. Apparently it wasn't enough and that is why it is getting dumped. Alternatively, Google crushed it harder than they predicted so it is going up."
2021-04-27 07:52:08,stocks,"Nah didn't quite catch the bottom, I got in around 90 GBX a share. They did a share dilution though, so it may never get back to pre covid levels.

Just realised you were asking for ETFs not individual stocks."
2021-04-27 14:54:11,stocks,"Ah yeah, I misinterpreted."
2021-04-27 13:51:46,stocks,I see why that would get your heart racing lol. But it should be fine.
2021-04-27 16:11:26,stocks,"I'm not either. Well, I wanted to add more yesterday so that's unfortunate. But there's still a lot of room to grow."
2021-04-27 16:23:37,stocks,"Their future guidance is terrible. ""Slowing user growth due to people going outside more and using the internet less, resulting in companies buying fewer adverts..."" . They basically said their super big growth during covid is unsustainable. Think they might be bound under 70 for a while."
2021-04-27 13:01:31,stocks,"Depends. We had a couple days where the leadup was wobbly, but the following days we flew. I guess just watch the indexes, if you see a green rocket, we're sorted because it will probably give us a couple more green days after"
2021-04-27 13:13:10,stocks,Which is interesting because he always says that he intends to keep rates low and the market doesn't ever seem to believe him.
2021-04-27 16:28:12,stocks,"no that's your bank account, so you'll have to declare it"
2021-04-27 14:10:46,stocks,"Apparently there is a growing user base who just subscribe to the app for yoga, stretching, running etc. No bike or treadmill. Perhaps more importantly, user time for non-equipment activities is growing. 

I don't believe Peloton breaks down how fast this segment is growing. i.e., in fiscal 2019, 35% of workouts completed were not indoor cycling classes but what this means in the broader context is anyone's guess. Until they do I'm a bear, but no. It's not a subscription service to buy equipment. That's what you're not understanding"
2021-04-27 14:20:26,stocks,"For sure, It’s definitely been difficult to watch by I think the long term potential for it is huge, so the best I can do is just keep averaging down when it makes sense 👍🏻 we got this"
2021-04-27 18:42:54,stocks,This guy expects
2021-04-27 17:29:48,stocks,I think I follow.
2021-04-27 05:44:43,stocks,"No chance of an EV. They announce new products at consumer events, not at earnings. Slated plan is also 2024 or something so a long way to go."
2021-04-27 06:01:16,stocks,tbh i don't think either is happening
2021-04-27 07:10:37,stocks,Wish I had more of both> Good moves.
2021-04-27 07:33:46,stocks,No chance of Ev anouncement on earnings.
2021-04-27 12:50:56,stocks,I think he's more confused about the dragon sacks and claws and all that jazz
2021-04-27 08:19:52,stocks,Option as a whole. So essentially it's saying the two are decaying and about a quarter penny a day

2021-04-27 11:37:46,stocks,"AMD trades sideways plenty, then runs up rapidly as analysts notice what should have been obvious so I'm not worried about my long thesis. The others are mega caps too and you don't expect as much volatility there.

The market is still up around 10% YTD and that's a doubling time of less than 5 years assuming the trend continues."
2021-04-27 10:45:41,stocks,That's not what tanked means man.  Tanked is usually read as a pretty sizeable drop.

2021-04-27 11:12:29,stocks,I would prefer a porsche over tesla but I hope porsche improve their battery range in the upcoming versions.
2021-04-27 11:34:57,stocks,"I'm counting on Tesla using that revenue stream to quadruple their production capacity at a minimum before it goes away, which should only take a couple of years (although FWIW I think it'll last more like 4-5 given battery constraints and the number of laggards out there)."
2021-04-27 17:23:36,stocks,"Yes, I agree. The numbers look impressive compared to Q1 2020. I had a feeling today wouldn't end well. They are very seasonal with Q1 and Q2 weaker than Q3 and esp Q4.

The bearish case is that they are flat on US users for the third quarter straight. It probably means that we will see a decline in number of US users in the next year. It's probably already happening with daily active users but they only report monthly active users which declines slower. But as long as international users keep growing nicely, I'm bullish. They have so much room to grow revenue if they keep improving their international ARPU, which they seem to be doing nicely. It'd take them at least few more years to really reach the monetization potential internationally."
2021-04-27 16:43:12,stocks,"Yup! No problem.

2021-04-27 14:28:53,stocks,"I have the bike and obviously the subscription. It is wonderful. 

Now subscription if you HAVE the bike is $40/month. 

If you don’t have the bike and only use it for streaming, subscription is $13 I believe. Much cheaper. I am curious what % is paying that $13 only.

They also have a boutique and sell clothes and they sell out in minutes. I buy their stuff all the time when I can find anything in stock. Super crazy prices too ($120 for a pair of pants/etc. )

Also, about “poor people”. I belong to several peloton groups/Facebook pages. There are all types of people there. People asking if they can fit in their new bike in a tiny NYC studio, people wondering if their delivery team will find their farm house in the middle of nowhere, people living with their parents after they lost their jobs wondering if their parents can use the bike as well... it isn’t just the yuppies and the rich. We are saving $150/month by switching to peloton from gym memberships. 

I haven’t jumped on their stock though. I am on the fence about valuation."

Apple needs to branch out.. how many more iPhones will they be able to get away with?> All cash just deflating.. they need to pour it into something and make a move. I still dont understand how they justify doubling since last year. Its not a growth company. Not Fud.. just talking logistics. EIther that.. or they need a couple sideways months to justify current price.. IMO. They have a rabid user based (Who the hell knows why) but they need a new project . Think about that 1k mac stand.

All companies I have worked for give iPhones to employees and not android phones because android is much easier to gain access to. Also, Apple CPU technology is leaps ahead of anything Qualcomm is putting in Android phones so iPhones tend to run smoother for longer, and for some people, performance is the most important aspect of owning a phone. Imessage is still leaps ahead of anything android is doing with SMS. The price argument is no longer valid as iphone released the Iphone SE which is meant to compete with cheaper android phones at 399. I'll throw in last point which is more people buy apps on iphones so apps generally run better on iphones because devs spend more time optimizing for a platform they can make money on."

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

A $20 plastic watch from Decathlon is way better than a $9,000 Rolex Submariner for diving.

So, even if OP was a diver, it still wouldn't justify buying an expensive watch. (If you wanted to spend money on a wrist accessory for diving you'd buy a diving computer). Watches worth more than a couple hundred bucks should always be treated as jewelry, not as a tool."

2021-04-27 02:18:04,stocks,"I disagree only with the timeframe. There are only 1.4 million electric cars on the road in the US right now, with 280 million privately owned gas vehicles and 12.5 million gas commercial trucks. While electric cars existed since the civil war, its only since 2016 that electric cars made any inroads. While sales should begin to ramp up, 15 million gas cars are expected to be sold in 2020. That's a normal year for gas automobiles. Projected sales for 2030 is half that, at 8  million privately owned gas cars projected to be sold for 2030. So for 2030, gas and electric car sales are projected to be equal. This will not diminish by attrition or replacement, any significant percentage of the 280 million currently owned gas vehicles.

Not only do NEW car sales have to transition to EV, but all 280 million current gas automobiles need to reach a minimum mass through replacement. If by 2040, gas automobile sales cut in half again to 4 million, with 12 million electric cars sold, that is when electric cars will begin to significantly replace gasoline automobiles. Using the projected sales figures by the auto industry, by 2040 there would be half electric vehicles on the road and half gasoline remaining, with about 150 million of each. Gas stations won't feel the heat to have EV charging until this critical mass is reached about 2040.

And this timeframe is assuming there is 0 pushback from Exxon, and other gasoline giants with massive waves of advertising to sway public opinion to retain their products, or kickbacks to car manufacturers. Both utilities...electric and gas...will be at war when EV heavily affects gas' bottom line around 2030."

I was thinking about entering into VNO, because it seems like a great value play for the long term. VNO owns properties In New York, chicago and san Fransisco I believe. But in my reading I stumbled upon that office real estate is a very fractured market and no player owns very large amounts of the total office space in any one city, making it very competitive.

It seems VNO is not doing great because of covid due to their focus on New York properties, but I usually like to buy value stocks going into weakness because they don't have a lot of upside priced in. Should I do the same style when I invest in reits? 

I was wondering if anybody could recommend any good reits or share any knowledge about what they tend to look for? I love to do my own dd and will always just appreciate anything that will give me an excuse to read up."

I think it’s certain that some people will go back some of the time, other people will go back all of the time but all of the people will not go back all the time. Sorry for The historical reference. I don’t feel comfortable taking the risk that I misjudge the going back to the office effect.

How about this instead. Hotel REITs. Everyone wants to travel and that means hotels but that’s not enough. Will business travel come back bigger and better?

First thought would say no. The technologies that enabled companies to communicate during the lockdown are valuable and will forever replace some business travel.

However, nobody wants to commute anymore. It seems likely to me that many employees will work from home most/some of the time. Where will these employees stay when they come back to the city centers for their monthly meeting?

I wonder if hotels in city centers are a better investment than office space in the same areas.

Now, suppose I’m wrong. Suppose everyone comes back to the office. City centers are busy again  and the sidewalks full. Then business travel would also be busy for the same reasons. Everyone wants to be there."

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"What are y'all bullish on these days? I am actually quite bullish on tech right now and it's the highest percentage of my portfolio that it's ever been, more than 7%! I have positions in lam research, amd, Snap, and I want back into intel (sold before earnings because it was getting a bit crazy and easy to see the drop coming.)

AMD I scooped up on a dip and have been happy, I bought some more today and averaged up a tiny bit. I am actually not the biggest fan of their pc parts, but it's because I'm old school and just prefer intel CPUs and nvidia gpus. But many enthusiasts are actually using AMD these days, and their numbers have been well. They have a PEG of ~1.5 which doesn't exactly make it great value right now, but I think the stock is undervalued compared to peers. I will hold this and average down if when I get the opportunity.

Lam research has a PEG of 1.2 and I expected it to be higher honestly. I bought the stock with the intent to hold for long and average down over time but I haven't even had that opportunity yet. Wish I bought a bit more to trim, but I think I will stick to my guns and hold it long. 

Snaps just a long hold, definitely way overvalued, but I expect to average down at some point. I'm honestly in snapchat because my portfolio has been very boring lately, and I've owned the stock before at much lower prices. Their earnings report wasn't terrible, wasn't great, but I think as the years go on the company will be able to do well. I'm not really too attached to this play, it's a small percentage and it's a bit speculative and not really my style, but for now I'm a happy holder especially since they did breakeven on this earnings.

Intel is a powerhouse and many call it a value trap, I think the markets just waiting for them to stop making mistakes and I think Pat will be able to SLOWLY turn them around. Long hold and I will buy some soon, haven't gotten back in it yet.

I'm also extremely bullish on oil and energy. Brent has been doing very well and holding for now, and I think that the debt the oil companies has accumulated was actually beneficial because it's so cheap. Exxon and chevron I love, as well as the pipelines. (I sold all my enbridge early, and may sell some puts to try and get back in at a small discount)

Carbon capture is a tried and true method of reducing emissions, albeit not the best way of going green, but it will be profitable IF Biden can put a price on co2. BP, shell, and exxon all already do this as well as many other companies. Don't know too much about it but I did some light reading for a couple hours and it's old stuff been around since the 70s, but it does work and is a realistic next step in reducing emissions. Definitely not a permanent solution but I see it as a necessary stepping stone and there may be money to be made.

Oil is also not going anywhere for at least a decade, probably longer, so I believe these companies are all extremely undervalued even after their run ups. Going forward 2 years I think even when oil prices normalize,  I think the giants will be in a better position overall. 

I like GE for their wind turbines as well, although it's much smaller scale and doesn't really bring much to stock price. I believe Siemens does this as well, but I do not own siemens. With Biden in office and oil prices getting high, it's the perfect storm for greener energies.

I went into this earnings season a bit bearish and I still expect it to be rocky, so properly hedging should be on everybodies list as well. But I believe the bull market will be fine over the next year, albeit not completely smooth. Healthcare is a solid industry to invest in during times like these as the big names are quite undervalued. I'm not bullish on healthcare, but it's a savings account and it's not volatile when everything else is, so its a defensive play when IV is very low."

I'm confident INTC will turn things around in the next 3 to 5 years. I think they've got quite a moat left and can't imagine they will go down without a fight. It wasn't long ago my colleagues at work were scoffing at my rig for having an AMD chip instead of Intel. Now it's the opposite, and ironically, I have an Intel chip in my current rig. Things change quickly in this industry.

I love the idea of clean energy vehicles, but I try to be a realist. Despite the hype around clean energy tech and EVs, there lies a brutal gauntlet ahead for that market, between costs related to materials and R&D, lack of widespread public infrastructure outside domestic cities, promotional hurdles and resisting sentiment (e.g., petrolheads will hardly let up driving gas-guzzling tankers like Caddies and Cudas), and the most important thing of all: The price tag. EVs are the future, but the market has priced in the future over ten years away. As much as I hate to say it, oil will probably be sticking around for at least another decade.

The Japanese rails thing is pretty much just a reopening play. People like to cite the work-from-home threat but these rails are used for a lot more than just commuting. People shop, have social lives, and travel.

Everything else in my portfolio right now is basically a hold for me so while I *was* bullish on those, I'm more neutral now."

But I mean, I only take bullish outlooks long term, because overreaction drives the short term. In the short term a stock can look great, and then gets a little bad press, and boom, it's tanking.

2021-04-27 02:20:02,stocks,"I'm in the same boat, alot of my value plays have become slightly less desirable to keep buying, which is why I am trying to broaden out a bit into tech, as I actually saw some decent plays there. I do like the ev play, but stock wise it's extremely ridiculous and I don't see much money to be made. 

Chevron and toyota have a solid new-ish deal with Chevron providing cleaner hydrogen for toyotas fuel cells and also investing in the infrastructure required for said fuel cells. I am a long term bull on green hydrogen, that being said, the only realistic stock for me to play this with is APD, everything else is un-investable right now. I did like Ballard power at sub $10. 

I chose to go safe with the ev market and I bought lithium mining stocks last year, particularly Livent and albemarle, but I have exited those positions since the prices they were at didn't make much sense, I had to take all my profits. I also invested in platinum/palladium mining companies (mainly sibanye-stillwater) because EVs and hybrids use a lot more of those platinum group metals than ICE cars. I figured that was the safest exposure to that bubble. 

A Japanese rail play is actually very out of the box and I respect that play. That's some shit that I would come up with haha. 

Intel is gonna take time, but I think Pat is good for it long term. And you're right, I used to hate on AMD and now all my buds hate me because I'm running an i9 instead of a AMD processor. I do hold AMD as well, but I think both companies will thrive and coexist well, especially if Intel's plans to get into the foundry business eleviate some of the data center market share risk. If anybody can pull it off, it'll be intel. They have massive pockets and a lot of government backing to make sure they succeed."

The Japanese rails thing was something I thought of when I realized I was a bit too late to the airline recovery play. I was in Japan for a short period and got around everywhere on their public rails. The rail systems were impressive to me coming from the U.S., and the traffic on them in the cities was *insane*.

And yeah, as far as Intel is concerned, I do work on high-performance computing systems for weather and climate that are supported by the federal government (e.g., [Cheyenne](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/cheyenne) and [almost](https://www.noaa.gov/organization/information-technology/jet) [all](https://www.noaa.gov/organization/information-technology/gaea) NOAA HPC infrastructures), and they pretty much all run on Intel.

I did projections based on the worst earnings in the past 6 years (excluding the last year obviously) to guess at what I called ""deficits"" in certain valuation multiples based on today's prices. It's a bit weird but I basically used the worst performances of the last 6 years to establish fundamentals based on today's prices to get a sense of what the valuation of the companies would look like if they managed to recover to their worst-performing quarters of the last half decade. 

Aside from that, there are a couple developments going on on these rails related to energy and upgrading rail stock, which is typical. The JR line has been working on construction for Chuo Shinkansen which will likely take more than a decade to complete. The same umbrella company has proposed extending their reach into other countries in southeast Asia in the future, but I think this is very overzealous and I'd be surprised to see much come out of it."

2021-04-27 00:02:35,stocks,"4:1 reverse split means for every 4 stocks you have you get 1.

So if you hold 16 shares of xyz at $1 after a 4 to 1 reverse split you'd have 4 shares of xyz at $4

A reverse split can be how ever many stocks into 1 (I've seen pennies with billions of shares do reverse splits where a thousand shares equals one new one)."
2021-04-27 00:00:28,stocks,Reverse splits increase the stock price.
2021-04-27 00:21:01,stocks,"Lets say you have a $100 million dollar company and they have a billion shares outstanding. Each share would be worth 10 cents. Then they do a reverse split. Let’s say, every ten shares merges into 1. So now each share is worth $1. 

Not all historical charts are responsive and will change to reflect the reverse split. So if you have an unsophisticated chart from some free site you found on Google, the chart might wrongly show the $1 share price as the historic price per share. That would value the company at 1 billion dollars, which is not correct. 

There’s also a lot a company can do to try to juice their stock price and hoodwink beginner investors (especially penny stocks or shady operators). Reverse splits can be one way to do that—they puff up the price without really adding anything of value. It’s largely psychological or they may do it to meet listing requirements or attract investors who won’t trade in pennies. 

When in doubt, look at market cap—shares outstanding multiplied by price. How has that changed over time?"
2021-04-27 00:25:54,stocks,"Here's how you check.

I use yahoo finance, but any reliable source for historical data works.

Take the price from way back then, like 100million or whatever, and multiply by the split ratio. So if there was a 1:4 split, multiply by 1/4 (divide by 4). In the case of CEI, they [went thru a number of splits ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CEI/history?period1=1177977600&period2=1619481600&interval=div%7Csplit&filter=split&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true). So it's 100mil/4/25/25/25/25/50... Which is $1.28 and should be what CEI was trading at in January of 2008.

Don't let that distract you from the fact that if you invested $100m in CEI at that time, it would be worth one share today. Lol"
2021-04-27 00:04:20,stocks,"So that actually makes sense, but why does CEI say it traded for millions a share? How much does that average it down?"
2021-04-27 00:23:27,stocks,"Thank you for this, this helps me grip the fullness of what I’m looking at. So in order to look at the market cap (which I assume is peak price) I would click on that somewhere in the brokerage account?"

2021-04-27 00:10:52,stocks,"Seems like the company has done alot too its share structure. Last split was a reverse one, but when you look at the chart it shows the price as if the reverse split had taken place even though it hasn't. So as far as I can tell they did a 1:25 followed by a 1:50 reverse split. That means that back when the stock is shown as in the millions, it probably wasn't since 1 share now is worth 1250 shares before it was split. Let me know if that makes sense."
2021-04-27 00:26:59,stocks,"Yes, market cap is usually one of the basic things listed about a stock when you click on the info."
2021-04-27 00:13:50,stocks,"It kinda makes sense, so basically the shares back then were only worth a few bucks? Or was it a few hundred at its peak? I’m sorry if I’m asking so many questions, I feel so thrown by this concept"
2021-04-27 00:24:37,stocks,"Yeah pretty much so like let's look back at the old example I used.

You have 100 XYZ @ $1

XYZ does a 10:1 reverse split

You now have a 10 shares of XYZ @ $10

If you look at the chart of XYZ before the reverse split it'll show a price of $10  per share (because the new share is worth 10 of the old ones)

I'd guess CEI was at a few thousand a share back then before they did that really big reverse split so that's why it says 2 million a share lol"

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Can one accumulate wealth by investing in the market? Hi, I am a college student living in South Korea currently studying the US stock market.

While I have been investing in various stocks since junior high, I've made multiple profit and losses(including a recent GME investment caused by r/wallstreetbets) and learned some important lessons: it is always important to look long-term in order to accumulate wealth.

My ultimate plan is to create a $40M \~ amount of wealth from the investment while successfully building up my career as a Cybersecurity researcher - a job with an entry-level wage of  $50K and goes up to $200K at maximum once become a senior-level employee.

Currently, I'm planning to invest in CIBR(Cybersecurity ETF), TECL(Tech 3X ETF), FAL(Financial sector 3X ETF) and hedge the risk by investing 20% in VIXY(VIX index fund). According to my calculation using efficient frontier(which I learned from college econ class), an optimal portfolio creates an annual return of 35% with bearable risk.

If I keep investing the majority of my savings in this type of portfolio and stay focused on long-term investment, would I accumulate wealth while living as a salaryman? Or is it just my illusion that I can make $40M just from an investment fueled by annual salary?

&#x200B;

Edit : I was stupid and did the numbers wrong - I was talking about 4M instead of 40M. I know 40M is totally unrealistic :-)"
2021-04-27 03:56:14,stocks,You had me at 40M - what an unreasonably high expectation - wow!
2021-04-27 00:08:10,stocks,"20% on VIXY is going to eat you alive long term.  its a very short term hedge.  it naturally decreases 5-10% per month (yes, month not year) due to fighting yield curve and churn into near term options."

2021-04-26 23:48:26,stocks,"$40M is likely a stretch, but generating substantial wealth through investing is very possible.

2021-04-27 00:36:42,stocks,"Max out your retirement and buy VOO. You'll see a 8-10% annual return and will do pretty good. 

A 35% return is not sustainable unless you do serious DD and buy cheap value companies. 

This current market frenzy is not the norm. Sometimes you have to swim upstream. 

When we see the market correct don't let that discourage you from investing. Just keep buying with every pay check. Max out your 401k and your IRA accounts. Always buy. Never sell. 

In 30 years you should have a few million."
2021-04-27 00:10:28,stocks,">If I keep investing the majority of my savings in this type of portfolio and stay focused on long-term investment, would I accumulate wealth while living as a salaryman?

I'd advise against that!  Never invest money you *need!*  Imagine a health issue*and* a falling market.... How do you close the gap?

Also, patience is required.  Watch the financial issues to refrain from bad timing.. but don't expect that to result in good timing.  I can avoid falling stocks, but only twice bought at *the bottom!* Selection isn't done that way.

While almost everyone has a good story this year, Note:  a wild bull market won't teach you *anything* useful!  You'll have a sense of brilliant picks. But this isn't a market that separates good from brilliant. This year, the below average look brilliant!  It's a falling market that will highlight true brilliance.

I've been at this from time to time for decades. I'm not wealthy because of it, but I can say my retirement years won't have me moving to a poor side of town."
2021-04-26 23:46:20,stocks,"I don't think you can reliablely expect annual return of 35% every year. Maybe a few years. But be ready to expect negative returns in some years. Maybe even - 50%.

Market go up and down. Just because you made 100% return last year don't mean you can repeat it again, ever.

40M is a lot of money. You would need to double up a lot of time. You have higher chance of winning the lottery. We often hear hedge fund make billions, but do you remmeber the recent margin call? 120 billion gone.

As your AUM grown. It become harder to get better returns.

Its easir to double 1M to 2M than 10M into 12M"
2021-04-27 07:04:31,stocks,"As others have said, 35% return is unrealistic. For comparison Warren Buffet's average return is ~20%, and the S&Ps is ~10%. 

You can beat that quite handedly in the short term, as many have done this year, but it is unreasonable to expect to sustain it. 

Risky stock pickers may out perform but they are much more likely to crash and burn, even one bad year can set them way back. Returns 0f 10,10,10,10,10% each year compounded, gives you more than 30,30,30,(50),20% compounded. 

Also, the larger sums you deal with the more you move the market. When your investing $10k, you are unlikely to make any stock move, but as that goes up to say $1M, your orders may have an impact on the price action and make it challenging to get a good buy or sell price. This would make small cap stocks less feasible and limit you to larger companies.

With all that said, you can accumulate wealth in the market, either with stock/sector picking or index funds. $40M is unlikely, but $5-$10M is achievable."
2021-04-27 18:26:45,stocks,Strategy instantly falls apart with that sentence.
2021-04-27 06:18:23,stocks,"My kind of thinking. Started investing around 25, now in my early 40s- I make just under 200k with returns around 8-10 %. Ive maxed 401k and IRA and pour the rest into index funds and a handful of stocks. I’ve been really happy with the progress."
2021-04-27 00:08:17,stocks,It is not easier to double money than to increase it by 20%. What? Lol
2021-04-26 23:59:11,stocks,"Higher chance of winning the lottery? That is not true at all. The chance of winning the lottery is 1 in a 11,000,000. Same chance as getting in a plane crash."
2021-04-27 04:58:17,stocks,"Could you elaborate why you feel its easier to double 1M to 2M than 10M to 12M? Whenever I talk to someone new on the stock market I start it off with 2 things:

1) The stocks are not an entity existing on their own, their entire value comes from buying and selling. If no one does that, the price will not change at all (it took me a while to understand that there is no entity value in a stock, if a company performs well or bad, it has 0 impact on the stock itself, the only impact comes by selling/buying, kept simple since there is technically way more to it)

2) The stock market works in percentages. If you can average 30% a year on 20€, you could also average 30% a year on 20M €. The importance is building up a strategy and knowledge what you need to do, investing more should be done afterwards.

Based on what do you say that it's harder? Emotionally? Impact wise? I can't see a big impact by the changed number since most stocks won't even move a 0.1 by a bigger purchase (if you diversify)."

2021-04-27 06:45:09,stocks,"As asset increase the ability to stay fluid decrease.

I can sell 135 dollar, 1 share of apple, very easy.

At 2 million is 7400 (you bought it at 50% off) shares, harder to sell, but still rather easy. It's only 74 contracts. 

At 12 million, that's 74000 (bought it at 20% off) shares. How often do you find people buying this large amount of apple shares? You have to find multiple buyers. This is 740 contracts. The amount of money is beyond average retail investors. As you sell, the price will drop, so you won't even get the 20% premium.

As asset increase the ability to sell freely, become restricted. Average Joe buy apple 135 a share, no problem. Millionaires who want to buy 12 million of apple are less in number, and they want to do the transaction privately, at their own discount. There may be a few millionaires who want to buy you shares, but your broker need to find one. Average Joe broker isn't gonna be able to find it for you (like the broker we poor people use)."

2021-04-27 06:52:48,stocks,"I fully agree with you that if you spend all of your money into a single stock then this is a bad idea, but I don't think this is reality at all. But I can't follow your train of thought.

Apple has a market cap of 2.26 Trillion. If I buy shares worth 2 million that's 1/1000000 of its full market cap, or 0.0001%. What kind of increase/decrease in share price are you expecting out of that? Sure if I buy all at once it will have a bigger impact, but thats also not known to me to be a common method of investing.

If you diversify your portfolio a single stock should not exceed 5-10%, on 2 million thats 100-200k, on 10 million thats 500-1000k. But as said, this is build up over usually weeks or months."

I am just using aapl as an example, may not been a good one. Aapl don't double in 1 year usually. But it can go up 10 to 20%

You can watch Warner buffets video. He would explain better than I do.

I learn it from him, and Charlie munger. I agree with their opinion."
2021-04-27 08:04:48,stocks,"But I still don't understand your point, who puts 100% cash into one stock? And I haven't heard of anyone doing all at once if they exceed a certain amount, same for selling. And even for small cap stocks they range from 300 million to 2 billion, while by far less, even at a 10% investment of 10 million you look at an increase of 1/300 up to 1/2000, or 0.3% up to 0.05%. But I heavily doubt someone would take a small cap company as their major investment."
2021-04-27 08:24:52,stocks,"If you diversify. Then you make return as much as the index. Which on average would be 7% annually.

Even hedge fund have hard time beating the index consistently on a 20 year time line. Op will need 20 years to compound his gain. At 7% compound that's 3.87x. To reach 40m op would need 10 mil initial investment 20 years ago.

The best bet is really buy 1 stock and hold for 20 years. Such as stock like aapl, if OP invested 1000 in 1999, he would have 1.3 million right now. So op needed 31k in 1999 and buy apple. 

Holding 1 stock have risk, op could have picked something like nortel, in which he would lost everything during the tech bubble."
2021-04-27 08:28:29,stocks,"Saying to hold a stock based on what it had in its babyshoes is a very bad idea and if you buy 10-15 stocks you are by far not even close to make a return like an index. And hedge funds have a different interest than gaining money - its mostly making sure to keep at least the amount they have to gain more investors, so security will/should almost always come first.

I fully agree with every point you make aside from that, but my main reply was to the difference of 1mil to 2mil, not what he needs to reach 40m. A majority fails to beat the market, so hoping to go from nothing to 40m is far beyond reality."
2021-04-27 08:49:28,stocks,"Op and yourself can certainly turn 0 into 40 mil in 20 years. There is the possibility. 

What I am saying is, average investors, well vast majority of the investors, won't be able to do it. In my opinion, about 90% of the investors won't be able to do it; this include professional investors.

Holding 10 to 15 fund, may beat the index in a few given year, but it will lose to the index in another few given year, over all, probbaly won't deviate much from index.

In the extreme example, dfv yolo into gme and turned 700k into 40 mil at the peak of GME. So it is certainly possible. But how many dfv are out there? Maybe 1 in 7 billion?"

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"CD Projekt Red - DD worthy? I've been looking at the stock price for CDPR - ticker: OTGLY

It's just been cratering. I know there were a lot of issues with Cyberpunk (issues which speak to major internal problems) but they have still made a ton of money on it. I guess I'm wondering if someone knows something I don't before I do a deep dive. I mean, is the reputational hit of one bad release worth this much of a hit to the stock?"
2021-04-27 00:45:37,stocks,It's not so much that the stock was hit. It's just that it had been pumped up to silly levels before the release. Considering the disastrous launch CDR is fairly valued at about 140-160 zl
2021-04-27 06:52:44,stocks,"Once you've done your deep dive, I would love to know why they decided to pay out a dividend. I can't wrap my head around why management thinks now is a good time to pay a dividend."
2021-04-27 00:55:17,stocks,Pink sheets are trouble
2021-04-27 12:10:01,stocks,"In a thread that is full of biased hot takes you gotta remember a few things:

Despite the launch, Cyberpunk 2077 Sold 13.7 million copies by the end of 2020. 

They had $563.7M in game sales in 2020, of that, they returned a mere $2.17 million in refunds. 

They are launching second gen console versions (of both cyberpunk and witcher 3)  this summer.

Things are not THAT bad for CDPR."
2021-04-26 23:23:47,stocks,That game had numerous AND massive problems. Gamers are going to avoid that company's future products like the plague
2021-04-27 04:17:53,stocks,"The Witcher 3 is thought of by many gamers as the greatest game ever created. TW3 is the sole reason cyberpunk was held to as high of standards as it was. Cyberpunk was a pretty incredible game actually just was over promised and released when it should have been delayed a bit longer. It's an awesome game, everyone should play it, well worth 60 bucks. Especially now. 

CDPR still have the witcher 3 legacy. I'm a huge fan of theirs because of witcher. With that said, I wouldn't buy their stock because I don't really know what they have in the works right now."
2021-04-27 06:51:22,stocks,"A few quick thoughts because I am also considering jumping in:

- the cyberpunk release was a complete disaster; not only was the game unplayable for console gamers, but it was nowhere near what was promised, they were actively misleading players
- the release was too early, because they wanted it to be out by christmas and before next gen consoles so that people might buy the game twice
- the negative press might be shortlived, but their reputation definetly took a hit (+ they got hacked)
- they had to do a complete strategy update with organizational restructurings
- the multiplayer was basically cancelled (they explicitly said they want to focus on singleplayer rpgs)
- they don't have another huge release in their pipeline afaik (I heard they were working on something on the side, but I don't know what)

So yeah, sure the stock got slaughtered, but for good reasons. It was overpriced, because the hype around cyberpunk was too crazy. I mean what do you expect from a game that was 8 years in development? 

Don't get me wrong, I love buying when there is blood in the streets, but CDPR has some fundamental proplems that will take time to get solved. I see no real catalysts for the near future. 

With all that in mind, is the market currently overreacting? I don't know.
I do think the stock is undervalued right now, but the risk reward does not seems as appealing as some other plays."
2021-04-26 23:27:20,stocks,"I'm not a gamer but was following the Cyberpunk stuff for a while.  The absolute backlash against the steaming hot pile of junk they released was enormous.

2021-04-26 23:26:38,stocks,"Are they? I'm not a part of the gaming community, but I'd be surprised if just one bad release did that much damage to the brand. EA has been releasing turd piles for years from what I understand"
2021-04-27 00:01:25,stocks,"They won't avoid them. NMS proved its possible to fix a broken game given time and effort. 

They may not preorder in the numbers they previously did though, since now they know its not a sure winner. 
1 bad game out of all the other winners won't crash the company. All it takes is another Witcher release and they will win back their rep imo."
2021-04-27 00:32:19,stocks,"Lol they made heaps off Cyberpunk easily, while gamers have short memories. They will still pre-order and buy their next game in droves. How much shit has EA and Ubisoft etc copped over the years, while they continue to sell big."
2021-04-27 00:07:04,stocks,"Right, but EA releases/publishes several games a year, with some pretty huge franchises while CDPR releases a major game every ~5 years and then relies on that game for revenue for several years through DLC.  If the game turns people off, which Cyberpunk certainly did, it's going to be tough going forward for a while.  I will also personally be quite wary of their next big game and will hold off from buying it."
2021-04-27 01:09:32,stocks,"Gamers aren't going to avoid CDPR games for this. Witcher is a highly, highly regarded franchise. 

The problem will be that, to me, I don't see any big catalysts coming any time soon. 

In the next 3-5 years when the next Witcher is coming, there will be plenty of hype and buzz. They also still made a killing off of Cyberpunk in spite of the bad press. 

With that said, I don't have any comment on actual stock value (I'm ignorant on this aspect)."

2. preordered      
3. disappointed     
4. swear not to support again

2021-04-27 07:57:40,stocks,"They have I would argue the difference here is EA has been turd pile releasing for basically the past decade plus.  They are known for it, it is expected.  Anyone who was going to be put off by that, has been gone for the past decade.   Obviously there are enough people left though for them to make massive profits.  

To counter point CDPR position, a lot of its hype was due to gamer good will they had built up over that same decade or so period.  Good will that has evaporated since then.  Now can they rebuild it?  Possibly, its true gamers really struggle with long term memories.  That said their free marketing team which was the goodwill of those same gamers at least to the short and medium term IS shot.  

The biggest difference is imo EA never tried to make itself pro-gamer as one of its pillars of its business.  It just pumped out games and marketing.  CDPR however has made its reputation a pillar of its brand, and thus I feel the damage could be longer lasting.  I'm not super negative on its future CDPR will go forward just fine, I just don't expect the same level of success, at least initially, from their next game."
2021-04-27 00:05:41,stocks,"They also acquired another studio so they can work on two games simultaneously. They have the Witcher series on Netflix and an animated Cyberpunk show upcoming. They just released a patch to fix many problems within Cyberpunk. They are adding DLC that will be the breadth of the core game once released, just like they did with Witcher. I think their reputation and the stock took a major hit, but it's not so devastating as to never recover."
2021-04-27 08:25:28,stocks,"While I would agree with you if we were talking about Bethesda, I really don't think CD Projekt Red will be forgiven by the internet in the same way"

2021-04-27 02:42:47,stocks,"Yes. Gamers are terrible at resisting temptation. That's why EA can make money by just selling useless cosmetics items.      

And despite the flaws in their game, I don't think anyone can deny that they have created one of the most beautiful and complex architecure. They have framework of everything, they just fucked up the detailing part."
2021-04-27 08:45:06,stocks,"If their next big game is another witcher game and it look promising. The publicity hit from cyberpunk will just be nothing more than distant memory. Everything in the gaming community is so overly sensationalized.

Thanks. Now I am going to keep an eye out for this stock."
2021-04-27 00:26:50,stocks,"Agreed. Heavily discounted entry point. They tried something different, which comes with great risks.

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Question on Diagonal Spreads So, I'm a newer person into investing and most of my interest is with options and I'm seeking to turn this into a primary source of income. I've been looking into stuff like the wheel strategy and poor mans covered calls (I believe they are Diagonal Spreads?) and my question is a simple one. I mostly already got the gist on how they work, I think. To make sure I'm the right page, for a poor mans covered call, you basically buy a far out, in the money call, and then as a second leg, you sell a call out of the money and closer to expiration. My question is, that in the event you DO fuck up, and get assigned on the short call, it's supposed to use the long call to cover the short call, would I gain the difference in the strikes, or does it all just go poof? Like, if my long call is at a strike of 8, and my short call is at a strike of 14, it moons, and I get assigned. Do I get the $600 out of that, or is it just all lost? If it depends on broker, I use TD Ameritrade. I feel like it's probably an obvious answer, but doesn't hurt to be too careful about it. "
2021-04-26 23:26:24,stocks,Yes you get the $600. You end up being short shares at $14 and you cover by exercising your option to buy at $8. Rarely would you get exercised except close to expiry and even then it’s rare.
2021-04-26 23:30:02,stocks,I’ve never heard it called a poor mans covered call - not sure the TD rules but at Fidelity they require a higher level of equity (either $10k or $20k can’t remember) to even open a diag spread position. Covered calls don’t have the equity limit as they are less risky.

2021-04-26 23:42:46,stocks,"Ah, I've only seen it called poor mans covered call, but when I put it on TD right now just to see how it looks, it recognized it as a ""diagonal bull call"" which I understand to be a spread. I don't know if TD will actually let me open it, logically, I can, because I can do covered calls, I can buy calls, and I have margin approval, but I suppose I won't know until I actually try and start one. I do know that Fidelity was a lot stricter though, I had to fight tooth and nail to still fail at getting options approval, which is why I'm now on TD lol."

If it tanks before assignment is something else, but that's kind of the risk with any strategy in this game, isn't it? Not just options."
2021-04-26 23:58:57,stocks,"Aye, that makes sense. A vertical spread is otherwise just... a call and covered call, but different strikes and expiration dates? Not sure if the expiration dates are important, but it can be bearish or involve puts instead of calls, yeah?"

You do realize most of that ""profit"" went towards the premium on the deep-ITM option, right? And that you're usually paying a higher time premium than you're getting on the OTM short, right?

Assignment is going to cost you that difference."

So  basically VSP and SCHD are both very spread out ETFs, So they are very  similar. I like them both because of that.  SCHD is a USD ETF and VSP is  a CAD ETF. I am a Canadian and I would love to buy VSP because its in  my currency and its convenient. But doing research, SCHD pays more  dividends.

VSP pays   around   $0.20-0.23CAD (0.16-0.18USD) per quarter and SCHD pays around $0.42-0.48  per quarter. I know that USA hold 15% tax of the dividends no matter  what but even so, thats around $0.37 per quarter per share. Should I  give up on VSP? And just convert my  funds to USD?

The growth seems to be very similar

SCHD

VSP

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"how to handle freaking out when the stock is moving up? This is kinda a weird question. 
When I have shares of a stock and it starts moving up I start freaking out and sell at a small profit because I am worried that it may crash. 
Most people short when they portfolio is negative, I can handle it fine, I can hold the stock fir a long time. 
My problems starts when I start making profit. 
For example, today I freaked out and put my CRISPR stocks to be sold if it's price drops by 1% (i.e. trailing stop order). Well that 1% went through and I sold them. 
But I think if I have hold it, it would move higher. 

Does anyone has a suggestion for me?

2021-04-26 23:11:12,stocks,I have target exit points when I buy a stock. Never close out all at once just like you never buy all at once. Goal is to hold for longterm capital gains but if your up 50-100% you should trim. Anything other than that just let it run. Time is on your side.

Just dump into VOO and forget about it or read some literature such as The Intelligent Investor to help control your emotions."
2021-04-26 22:41:12,stocks,"A couple things...IMO 

First, doesn't sound like you have a plan/goal when you're buying.   Take $CRSP for example.   Did you buy it to own it, or to trade it?  If to trade it, what was your target profit??  Having a plan going in allows you to be less reactive to the ebs and flows.

Second, if something gaps up way past where you thought it would be/above your target price for profit,  but you think it's got more room to run, you can always take your cost basis off the table and let the rest run.   That way you're guaranteed profit, maybe less than what you planned if it drops, but you still have exposure if it continues to run.  And again, since you covered your cost, it's all house money, so it should be a little less of an emotional experience. 

It's not about timing the market, it's about time in the market. 

Good luck!"

2021-04-27 00:12:58,stocks,"Use stocks and options to help with the psychology. Stocks are for investing. Options are for speculating. When you sell because you think it will go down that's speculating. 

Buy ""leaps"". Call options deep in the money that's a year or more out. Those act as a leveraged position with little time decay. 

If the stock pops and your leveraged position goes up feel free to sell it and use the profits to add to your long stock position. 

Or sell covered call options if you're feeling bearish. Better than selling outright."

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"What are Some Key Things To Look for When Doing DD? I’m a relatively new and young investor, and most of my portfolio is ETFs (IVV, VNQ.) When I started to buy individual stocks, I jumped into hype stocks without much/any research and while they aren’t doing too bad, I realized that I needed to do lots of research into companies I wanted to invest in. So my question is what are some things to look for when doing DD beside basics like profits and earnings?"
2021-04-26 23:03:41,stocks,"First of all, what does the company do? Why is it something that will either be relatively stable or even more important to humanity in the future? I don't feel that bullish about buying coal stocks this year.

Ok, how about other companies who do the same thing- why wouldn't you rather buy their stocks instead? Is your stock belonging to a small but growing company in that sector? Why is it growing? What is it doing right? There are a ton of EV companies in China getting attention this year. Why did Warren Buffet pick one and WSB another?

Is it a good time of year for buying your stock? For example, everyone wants to have clothing retailer stocks when they are reporting Q4 earnings. Nobody wants to be buying then. Buy after everybody else is done taking profit.

What's the company's situation with debt? High debt to assets (more debt than assets) or not so much? Is it mostly short-term debt or long-term? Is the company turning a profit? All the revenue in the world is not impressive if it gets eaten up by keeping the lights on. A certain stock beloved by non-human primates has shot up today upon news that a ton of the company's debt has been retired early, and the at the market offering of 3.5 million shares has been completed without the stock falling like a stone. That company's balance sheet is now a lot healthier, and they will be able to use the rest of the new money to change the business to run primarily online and be more customer service focused. I'm not convinced it will end up being the lunar phenomenon that the most ardent fans say it will be, but I'm happy to see that the company will have a second chance at life thanks to the likes of Ryan Cohen.

What kind of uncontrollable things might affect your company? This year, everyone with their eyes glued on semiconductors has gotten a lesson in Taiwanese climatology. Turns out water is pretty important to TSM's bottom line.

Go to Finviz and look at the chart for your stock. Is now a good time to buy? Does it look like it's at a temporary peak and volume is decreasing? Maybe hold off. Is the RSI over 70? Just wait a few days and pick it up at a discount. On the other hand, does it look like it's hit a bottom, bounced, hit the same bottom, bounced, and hit the bottom again? Now might be a good time to buy in that case. Check out the moving averages too... 20 day MACD shooting up over the 50 day is good news for bulls, 20 day MACD falling down below the 50 day is good news for bears.

While you're at Finviz, take a look at what analysts are saying about the target price of that stock. It's not that the analysts are always right, it's that people often listen to them. 

Ok, now price to earnings is a little controversial. Historically, a ratio of 39 or higher was considered bearish (see the crash of 1929 for more details), but due to the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in due to the pandemic, speculation is higher than normal right now and for the moment that's ok. Once we start reopening fully, if a company's price to earnings stays ridiculously high, that's not a great sign. Take a look at a bunch of car companies like Ford, Toyota, GM, etc. Check out their price to earnings. Then look at Tesla. The Tesla fan excuse is that TSLA is not purely a car company. If you want to buy a stock with some weirdness going on with the price, make sure you have put some thought into why it might be inflated.

Let's talk about the options chain. I know, you just want to buy shares, but the options chain will let you know if people are anticipating big moves in either direction. Compare the ratio of puts to calls to get a feel for how people expect the stock to move. Of course, they could all just be wrong and theta gang wins again...

Finally, check the news about your stock. Google news search is your friend."

Thought I'd bring my spreadsheet and some numbers with the upcoming May 6th Q1 earnings.  

There is something really fun about a company like MP  - since they are a *pure play rare earth oxide (REO)* company (though with metals production coming in 2022), we should be able to actually project their earnings for a quarter based on public data!  
## Method


First up, production numbers.  For simplification, and because on [page 6 of the 10-k for 2020 it is listed as the primary source of revenue](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001801368/7c83b453-4580-4c19-935a-5d198af27e58.pdf) this analysis will focus on Neodymium-Praseodymium (NdPr) for the forecasting.  Now we can [find the Q4 production yield in the annual results presentation easier](https://s25.q4cdn.com/570172628/files/doc_presentations/2021/MP-4Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-(3)-3.18.2021.pdf) so it gives a production volume of 9,337 MT of ore - an 8% YoY gain.  But they do project modest gains for the full year on slide 11, so for this analysis I'll keep it steady.  

But that part isn't interesting, what is interesting is [I found a source which gives the historical price of REOs by element](https://www.kitco.com/strategic-metals/).  This is a really great source because now we can find the average price of NdPr over both Q4 and Q1 and get a scaling factor.  The last piece is cost - because the cost of production will be the same assuming a flat production rate, and because the overhead costs have no reason to change, we can assume the costs for Q1 should stay relatively constant.

With all that in mind, [I compiled the data to find the average price of NdPr](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5HiTyzSbs7v7xsNUM-YF-lY1LEEG9VwYUIqFtdPy0E/edit#gid=0) over Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, and it just blew me away - NdPr is 50% more expensive in Q1!  So with that in mind, a little bit of math will tell the EPS:  

## Q4 2020
Costs: 18M

Sales: 42M

Net Revenue: 24M for EPS of $0.14 

## Q1 2021

Costs: 18M

Sales: 67.4M

Net Revenue: 46.7M for EPS of $0.27

## Analyst Estimates and Price Targets

[This EPS kills the high analyst estimate of $0.10 and average of $0.08 for Q1](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MP/earnings-estimates).  Now with those analysts giving a price target (making an assumption it is the same set of analysts, let me know if this isn't a good assumption), the high target price is 52.  By beating the high target by 2.7x, what do you think will happen after killing earnings by that much?  

Even for those of you who don't think analyst estimates and price targets are worth a damn, I went ahead and also calculated the annual EPS given a low ball 2% increase in production per quarter after Q1 and even reducing the price of NdPr to the mean of the Q1 2021 and Q4 2020 price.  Again - lowball - but the annual EPS came out to just shy of $1.  

Why does this matter?  They are still finishing their stage II plant meant to process the ore, then stage III to create finished products.  They will be a vertically integrated production facility enabling a massive increase in potential profit.  So that $1 EPS now is just the beginning, but they are (1) profitable now and (2) flush with cash after the share offering and green bond a few weeks ago.  And with the global demand for electric cars alone, there will be plenty of money to be made for the foreseeable future!

N.B. - The EPS from Q4 does not include non-recurring items, specifically a $66.6M fee to end an existing contract.  So when I say profitable, I'm talking about recurring costs.  

## Threats 

Yes, China flooding the market is a threat.  But considering Shengde, a Chinese company, owns 15% of MP - to me that minimizes that risk and honestly makes for a strong partnership until they get their stage III plant up and running.  Add to this, China's demand for REOs is also skyrocketing, the bigger threat might be China cutting off the US to only supply their own manufacturers.

Edit - Forgot to disclose my positions: Long MP, got assigned one CSP at a cost basis of 41, but bought a few hundred shares and a handful of June 18th 30c and 35c when it was around $28.  Currently sitting at an unrealized profit of $2,700 so not just some bag holder :)"

Great stocks though, so if you're dead set on doing it, these are good choices.

I get that GOOGL is a high dollar stock, so one share can immediately throw off allocations.  But AAPL doesn't need to. 

IMO, I'd rather see you buy 1 share of GOOGL (get the class A stock) @ $2317, then 9 shares of AAPL at a total of around $1150 and maybe 5 shares of HON to help balance you out a bit more 

But again, my humble opinion."

I apologize that I'm not posting here the numbers I'm looking at, but I have a habit of taking notes in Sheets, and I am unable to post screenshots here.

2021-04-27 01:39:03,stocks,"Buying Shopify isn’t a value play, it’s a bet on the underlying growth of e-commerce and on the company being a leader in that sector.

It’s currently priced with the expectation that it will average 20% annual growth over the next decade.   A optimistic bet, to be sure, but we have seen other companies achieve that kind success.  On the other hand, if they somehow sustain the >40% growth rate they’ve been hitting so far, the company will become incredibly valuable."
2021-04-26 21:27:56,stocks,"Definitely seems overvalued but also like it will continue to be successful for quite awhile. 

For those interested in a smaller competitor doing similar stuff: BIGC (BigCommerce). They have much more room to grow and a lot of companies I work with have been switching to them from Shopify because supposedly the user experience is better. They're also getting some big partnerships, most recently PayPal."

2021-04-26 21:27:32,stocks,"Yes, but it was also overvalued when it was trading at $100/share.

2021-04-26 21:47:53,stocks,Personally I'd like to think it will drop when things open back up and people dont fear shopping in outlets again. But if people really believe this is the new normal then this stock can double if not triple in a couple years.

2021-04-27 00:46:25,stocks,Oof  I'd get a call/put combo at that point
2021-04-27 13:27:28,stocks,"I think that's like saying the mom and pop general store is a competitor to Walmart -it's not. Sure the general store makes enough to provide money for rent (in this analogy would be Shopify) and provide a living for the business owner (Shopify client).  But how long can the general store compete? One little upset and it's bankruptcy. This isn't a matter of opinion, it's something that has played out time and time again. 

I go to a specialty grocer for a focaccia, fresh squeezed OJ, and sometimes gourmet ice cream. EVERYTING else I buy from Trader Joes or Costco. I LOVE the specialty grocer, it's an amazing store. Kind, friendly employees who provide an enjoyable experience. So, why go to that dreary Costco with the annoying lines? Because I can't justify spending an extra $100-150 on weekly groceries. 

Stay at home life has given new life to small unique businesses, but I think this ""new normal"" will be short lived. People aren't going to be spending most of their time at home shopping for oddball things much longer."

Edit: not sure why you're being down voted here, although I'm sure it's bc most wouldn't agree it's overvalued at 100/share (I don't agree, there's enough money coming in to justify at least 1/4 the valuation)."

A buddy has told me just how much he hates not being able to do face to face business and this is unnatural. That's one reason I think Shopify, Etsy, etc. all have their work cut out for them moving forward."
2021-04-27 01:30:24,stocks,"Not every seller wants to sell on Amazon. A lot of companies and retailers would rather use shopify and sell it on their own website where they can control the whole customer experience without Amazon taking a cut.

Shopify is used by plenty of companies worldwide and will continue to attract businesses who are looking to launch an online channel for sales."

2021-04-27 00:59:35,stocks,"Don't even know of eCom or BigCommerce.

My thing is, if I want something cheap and convenient I will go to Amazon. If I want to get something unique while supporting small business I will likely shop local.

Consider the consumer, aka me: most normal things (laundry detergent, soap, sponges, toothpaste) can be bought on Amazon for real cheap, a one stop shop. Some oddball things I use eBay (RAM, key codes). Things like cologne, only from manufacturer or mainstream retailer website because I don't want to be sent knockoffs from a 3rd party. I don't see it getting as big as people think it can because most consumers want convenience, savings, or both. Just like small business in the real world, small business online won't be able to keep pace."
2021-04-27 06:57:28,stocks,Yeah but who wants an established company that's also still focused on growth? I'm 65 and cashing out this year.
2021-04-27 19:17:36,stocks,"not sure either. I wasn't saying it would be overvalued at $100/share today, was simply stating that it was also overvalued at the time (2+ years ago) it was trading at $100/share and has since more than grown into that valuation. The point I was trying to make is that growth companies are perpetually over valued, and in a couple years people will think $1400/share was a steal."
2021-04-27 03:10:48,stocks,"I think online shopping is here to stay. Local businesses were already having trouble keeping up with Amazon. I’ve been seeing some distrust of Amazon products and their warehousing methods (I.e. mixing products from retailers, including fakes), and can see people foregoing the convenience and ordering nonconsumable goods through other outlets. 

For example, I started buying plants and seeds online from retailers, and can see myself continuing to do so after the pandemic is over."
2021-04-27 13:19:57,stocks,"I agree with you that not everyone wants to sell on Amazon. But I believe the average consumer would rather shop on Amazon. 

Just thinking out loud here: 99% of the things I need can be found on Amazon. Why would I waste time shopping around online looking for small businesses?

1. To save money - but smaller independents are going to have a hard time beating those prices by much, and I wouldn't want to spend an extra 5 minutes shopping around to save 20 cents on a tube of toothpaste.
2. Better customer service - but Amazon has awesome customer service. Package didn't arrive, they refund or replace. Ordered a memory foam mattress that didn't expand evenly when opened, they said it's too bulky to return so just donate it and a new one will be sent immediately. 

Most people want savings and convenience. This is why Costco, Target, and Walmart dominate. I hate to say it, but small internet businesses are going to go the way of small business in general. I know a lot of new accounts were had for Shopify recently, but I think about how many of those businesses will be insolvent in 2-3 years time."
2021-04-27 12:51:47,stocks,"Thanks for sharing., always glad to hear opinions across various generations. 

Are you cashing out because you think growth will slow down? I believe this is the case because they've likely \[because of Corona\] experienced growth that would have otherwise taken a few years. Of course this is only my opinion, but much like Netflix and others, it's going to make those figures much more difficult to achieve in the future."
2021-04-27 19:22:58,stocks,"We're in agreement then. And I agree that it's been way overvalued every step of the way. The question then becomes, has the market had enough of it, for long enough? Is the correction overdue?"
2021-04-27 15:19:42,stocks,"Interesting. I recently ordered a great deal of seeds, and put them all in an Amazon cart. Sure I could have shopped around and maybe saved a few bucks, but this was easy. I never shop from accounts that aren't heavily reviewed and sporting high ratings, and have had much success. 

So to your point, I agree that online shopping is here to stay, but when people aren't cooped up at home all day I think they will be looking for time and cost saving sites like Amazon. Personally I prefer the one-stop shopping experience with free shipping, and I know I'm not alone.

I have shopped from websites of Target, Macy's and Walmart, but for very specific items, and it's unlikely that I (and many others) will spend valuable time looking around for some small business online that specializes in something random like coffee, pet food, office supplies, etc. when all can be found on 1 website and put into a bulk purchase. It takes more time, and often time costs more. Plus if an item is missing or damaged, I want to be doing business through Amazon."

2021-04-26 23:30:14,stocks,"If you use current price multiples and combined revenue projections of AMD and XLNX, the “priced in” combo between the two has AMD drying below 90 through the end of the year and then performing well for a few years following. That’s assuming the share price tracks revenue performance relatively closely. 

If your timeline is multiple years, that makes AMD a strong buy. If you’re looking for something to give you outsized gains between now and December, it’s certainly possible; but only if the market prices in future gains ahead of actual performance."
2021-04-27 10:36:42,stocks,"The big thing in earnings report will be if they gained in servers.  We know INTC lost a ton of their monopoly on servers, but if AMD is the ones who have proven to take that, rather than ARM, that would potentially create some additional hype imo."

I think they wil meet expectations, and give a very realistic guidance. Due to chip shortage, nvda competition, etc. But theres also a big chance their data center market share increased exponentially, and that intel lied or in denial.

Regardless, i believe amd will meet expectations, or slightly go above earnings predictions. Give a neutral guidance. Result in a mid 70s either this week or soonish. And itll be a good buying opportunity."

* I don't know about Lyft, but Uber literally just copied Google's approach to self driving, and even went so far as stealing some of their source code (which Google successfully sued them over). How do you expect to be first to market if you literally just copy and paste the approach of one of the market leaders?

And the worst part about it for Uber and Lyft is what would happen to them if someone else beat them to making level 5 self driving vehicles? They'd have two choices, either use Uber and Lyft to find riders, or make their own ride sharing network to compete against them.

> People will still own personal vehicles for many decades. Even if they get autonomous driving to work, Tesla can't make enough cars.

Tesla can absolutely make enough cars. If robotaxis become the norm, car sales will collapse as people no longer need to own a car to get around. Sales will mostly be to taxi fleets. Tesla in theory can build 20M cars by 2030, in practice they may not even need to as that could be 50% of the market by that time provided we solved autonomy somewhere this decade.

> No operator would be willing to take you 2 hours to a low density beach town or to a mountain hike and risk having no fare on the return.

You don't need a fare back because the car can just stay there until someone wants a ride in that location. And if there are already enough cars in that area, one will drive somewhere else while you are taking your trip there and your car will replace the one that drove away. The network will automatically scatter cars around the country based on how many trips are planned at what time a day from which locations, etc.

This might sound unrealistic right now, but it's already being doing with things like eScooters that aren't even autonomous.

> No taxi operator would be willing to take a passenger cross country because if there's a vehicle issue, it will be hard to get fixed and expensive to tow.

Again, there's no taxi operator and it doesn't matter if it's difficult to get fixed because the car can just drive to a service center.

> Taxi service will be restricted even if the car can drive anywhere. Even if Tesla operated the service themselves, they would only operate in high density regions. They need a certain volume of cars in the fleet so the wait times aren't horrendous.

Again, see my explanation above. Wait times are irrelevant, because cars can distribute themselves. Many cars in high density regions, fewer cars in low density regions.

> It will be decades before no one will need personal vehicles. There just isn't enough production or demand.

People said they'd never carry a mobile phone around during the late 90s. 5 years later everyone had one.

> I'm not saying it's not in the cards, I'm saying the immediate future of autonomous taxis is more likely waymo than Tesla. If or when Tesla figures out autonomous driving, they will still compete with the other companies for a long time. There just isn't enough cars.

While I do agree that geofenced or at the very least area-limited robotaxis are most likely in the near-future (next 5 years), it all depends on how fast Tesla's neuralnetwork can train itself once their supercomputer comes online. If it trains itself as fast as other self-learning AIs, which is most likely, it will happen within 5 years and Waymo is fucked. That said, it could be more difficult than other self-learning AI products, so we won't know for a few more years.

> Even Elon said autonomous driving will become a commodity.

Elon said that ""eventually"" it will become a commodity. Tesla could have a monopoly for a decade before we get to that point, or it could become a monopoly because Tesla licenses their FSD, in which case they'll still make money from it."
2021-04-27 09:33:53,stocks,"Yeah but most people don't factor in 30+ years ahead. Most people don't even think about the next decade. You're think way out ahead. Most people will still need personal vehicles for decades.

People are all buying ICE cars today. ICE cars make up 97% of the market. EV cars are projected to be 28% by 2030, 58% by 2040. And most are going to be privately owned and not available for taxi. California isn't going to ban ICE cars until 2035.

More people will be car free when the price of taxis go down substantially, but that will only be possible in high density cities where there's high demand for taxis. That's for the next decade after autonomous taxis become available."
2021-04-27 09:42:12,stocks,I understand what you're saying. You're overly optimistic.
2021-04-27 10:40:49,stocks,"> EV cars are projected to be 28% by 2030, 58% by 2040.

I'm sorry to say, but no expert truly believes this. The projections you're referring to have been wrong every year for almost a decade now, yet they still refuse to adjust their expectations. They keep expecting EV sales increases to flatten off, when realistically they're just increasing.

EVs are already cheaper over a 3+ year period of ownership today. They are expected to become cheaper in terms of sticker price within 1-3 years. Then they're expected to drop another 20-40% throughout the rest of the decade. Meanwhile ICE cars are becoming more expensive.

Which idiot is going to buy an ICE car in 2030 when they're 20-40% more expensive to buy and 4x more expensive to own, as well as slower, less comfortable to drive and worse for the environment? I don't see how EVs won't be 80-90% of car sales by the end of the decade."
2021-04-27 10:35:53,stocks,"Perhaps, but it's difficult to get exponential progress like AI learning right. There's usually very little to no progress for the first 50% of the effort, and after that progress suddenly starts to become extremely fast. I already see significant improvements, which makes me confident we are further along than people think, but there's no way to tell how far we really are right now other than to wait."
2021-04-27 12:08:49,stocks,"People dont understand exponential change when it's happening....same thing when cars replaced the horse and buggy, when Amazon/Online destroyed retail....people just cant wrap their minds around change that big and fast..."
2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"What's the downside of selling this stock at a loss vs holding til it goes back up? I'm ok w the loss. Am I gaining anything by keeping it in my portfolio? It serves no value, right? I think that if I 'lose' anything, it will occur when the stock gets to around the price that I purchased it at, and I try to buy back in too late and end up paying more. Is that right? It just dawned on me that I may have held this for longer than necessary.

&#x200B;

RESOLVED: I sold. I unlocked more available cash and because the stock that I sold wasn't marginable, my brokerage automatically applied some of the freed up cash towards my marginable securities. So, I'm paying a bit less margin interest. Didn't think about that as being a plus. I'm also not worrying about that stock anymore and can move on to something else! Thanks for the advice!"

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 26, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 26, 2021**

The stock traded mixed on Monday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) continuing strong momentum from last week while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly fell. Looking ahead, market participants are preparing for a slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and the Federal Open Market Committee’s April meeting.

This week, a slew of huge companies are set to report corporate earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Altogether, the market caps of the companies reporting this week comprise nearly half the total market cap of the S&P 500, according to FactSet. So far, the vast majority of companies have vastly exceeded analyst estimates, with effective vaccine distribution in the US helping stoke demand as the economy gradually reopens. 

Eighty-four percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results to date posted a positive earnings per share surprise, according to data from FactSet. This would mark the highest percentage of companies reporting upside surprises since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008, assuming this beat rate holds through the end of earnings season. 

Last week on Thursday, stocks sold off sharply following reports President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%. However, the sharp bounce back we have seen suggests the initial sell-off was overdone. Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.""

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet for its April meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a monetary policy decision and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell slated for Wednesday afternoon. With the Fed having already signaled that benchmark interest rates would remain on hold through at least 2023, market participants are expecting virtually no major changes to policy to be announced.

**Highlights**

* Tesla (TSLA) beat analyst expectations in their earnings report. The stock is modestly down at the time of writing
   * Revenue of $10.39 billion vs $10.29 billion expected (up from $6 billion a year earlier)
   * EPS of $0.93 vs $0.79 expected
* The vaccinations effort continues with over 200 million Americans receiving at least one shot and 90 million adults fully vaccinated, according to data compiled by the CDC.
* The Biden administration wants to spend $174 billion to boost electric vehicles and charging stations but its 2030 climate emissions reduction pledge released on Thursday does not include a firm date to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. ""These autos are coming. We know it. It is the future,"" White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy said of EVs at an event in Washington promoting administration efforts to boost EV charging.
* In the wake of the fatal crash of a Tesla car in Texas on Saturday, two U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla vehicles.

The Company ultimately sold 3,500,000 shares of common stock and generated aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately $551,000,000. Net proceeds will be used to continue accelerating GameStop’s transformation as well as for general corporate purposes and further strengthening the Company’s balance sheet.

This is amazing news. GME sold 3.5 mil shares at ~$157 to raise 550 mil. The company has zero debt and now has signicant money to fund their transformation moving forward. Stock is currently up 12% in AH, reaching $190. GME is now primed for another run and the highly anticipated short squeeze is that much closer to reality.

One of the biggest knocks against GameStop was its debt. Now that debt is gone. Wiped away. 

The old management is out the door. Now comes the Cohen crew which has not been secretive about what they want—to make GameStop into a gaming powerhouse—online, console, mobile, esports. 

Can they do it? Cohen did it with Chewy, which somehow beat Amazon to the online pets everything market. 

 At $300 a share this would be a 25 billion dollar company. That is not unreasonable if GameStop hits its ambitious goal. For comparison, Chewy has a market cap of 34 billion."

3. Gaming sector is 280 Billion (not inclusive of China)
4. Chewy is 40 Billion Mkt Cap vs GameStop 11 Billion. I have trust in RC’s mgt and they’re bringing top level execs from Amazon.
5. Shills, misinformation and negative narrative on the stock asking people (won’t label who)  to sell. If it was truly done for, people would not spend tons of money on negative marketing and let it bankrupt on its own.

Seems like GME selling 3.5 million shares, it's a 4% dilution of the stock but that volume covers 1/3 of the outstanding short interest.

2021-04-27 06:55:06,stocks,Serious questions: Is tgis good or bad for short squeeze? Did hedgefunds buy those shares to cover their shorts?
2021-04-27 10:36:36,stocks,"its good news and all, but what price would the general consensus believe to be fair for gamestop? for the future it seems like no one really knows with this whole short squeeze stuff going on"
2021-04-27 15:22:58,stocks,Have they said what business transformation they are considering?
2021-04-27 16:34:13,stocks,y’all doubted us smh
2021-04-26 20:33:32,stocks,"goodbye any last hope of another short squeeze

EDIT: open question: why would GME let YOU take $1m/share when they've just proven they're happy to take $150/share for themselves?

a short squeeze depends on:

- lots of shorters
- limited float
- ability to force the price up

we now have

- few shorters
- unlimited float
- a mechanism which will flood the market with shares any time the price rises, soaking up buys, preventing further rises"

It goes red and I just go ""oh, okay it'll go back up eventually""

It then goes up and I go ""fuck yeah! Look at that sexy little number I'm so glad I held""

And then it goes down a bit and I go ""okay.... It'll go back up though.

And then it goes back up and I go ""fuckin sweeet!""

On days it's red I don't get disappointed, but on green days it's great! So overall I have a net positive outcome, so I hold just for the entertainment value alone."

Or the fact that their entire industry is being wiped out by game developers doing direct to consumer digital sales.

How can they rebrand themselves such that they have a better value add than other 3rd party resellers?"

I mean, I've already switched my console game purchasing from B&H to Gamestop. The selection is better, and I can often get my purchase same-day if it's in-stock at the store down the street (and B&H already had free next-day shipping - technically 2-day, but they're fast to me). If they can break into digital console game sales and PC game sales, they'll hit $300. If they manage to open BYOPC sections in their stores for hardware purchases, they'll hit $400-500."

Not the pervasive NWC problems?

What about the used phone wholesale business thats been helping keep the lights on that the company doesnt talk about (and subsequently sold)?

You sure you're not ignoring some of the fundamental problems with GME as a business due to personal interests and nostalgia?"

2021-04-26 23:22:12,stocks,If I was a betting man I would say that retail bought up most of those 3.5 million shares. If the short side didn’t buy many then the float would still be owned by retail. Doesn’t hurt the squeeze potential.

Yeah, they were raising cash and, traditionally, that tends lower the price, but have you not heard of the MOASS? Even if you don't think it's going to actually happen, it's not even a little bit worth the risk. Your losses are INFINITE and no one knows for sure what the stock is going to do. It's not just a ""meme stock"" there's legitimate DD that suggests it could skyrocket to $1k, $5k, $10k at any moment. Have you even been following it the past couple months? Remember when out of know where it bounced back and was up 270% in only a few hours?

2021-04-26 22:11:43,stocks,A simply google search is all it took but here’s one of many [articles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-13/gamestop-vanquishes-ghost-of-blockbuster-with-debt-redemption) on the subject from when they announced their intent to do so

2021-04-27 07:07:12,stocks,"I would say it depends on what you mean. If you expect the level of MOASS as some in the dedicated GME subs that think they will be millionaires with their singel digit stock count before summer its unlikely but not impossible. And by not impossible I mean if we argue that there is an infinite number of dimensions where every single thing that can happened has happened somewhere then a few of those has that level of MOASS. 

The more likely play is the long term bet on RC and the reinvention of GME and if that happens there is a realistic chance of a fundamental stock price in the 500-1000 range.

And no matter what you think of GME it is shorted and the stock must be bought back at some point. And the argument that the float still is in the tens of millions is becoming more and more unlikely. If you look at the ask bid total count it was in the hundreds of thousand in the first run up and now its unlikely to see it over 10k and dips below 1k in the lulls. 

The biggest factors of the likelihood and magnitude of a MOASS is how fucked are the shorts and how much of all the crackpot DDs about GME has actual merit. If it is more then none I think there will at least be a lot more volatility and more then one spike but how high that spike goes is uncharted territory and no one knows and anyone that claims otherwise is full of shit."
2021-04-27 04:25:47,stocks,"Yes, these people are fucking delusional.  GME has turned into one massive game of tug-o-war.   It's people shorting vs people pumping the stock."
2021-04-27 05:03:37,stocks,Yes r/superstonk
2021-04-27 05:43:25,stocks,"People hoped they wouldn't because 3.5m shares at $1B max would indicate they would sell shares around $280 something, which was above the price when it was announced indicating that they might hinder any upwards pressure.

People thought GME would dump these shares on the way up but they obviously didn't since volume and price has been mostly sideways for weeks and these shares are now sold. People also thought it wouldn't happen because Gamestop didn't sell their 6m+ shares in december (max $100m) which was the previous version of the ATM offering document.

Now the company has no debt, market cap of 13B and almost 1B in cash on hand to continue with the transformation.

What really is the catalyst for Gamestop to overtake Steam, Xbox, Amazon, Nintendo, and PlayStation in the video game e-commerce sector?

2021-04-27 02:50:27,stocks,"There is nothing stopping them from pivoting their business model and here's the kicker: we're watching it happen, now, before our very eyes.

Anyone who thinks this is going to be a one-dimensional mall retailer in 2025 is sleeping. Cohen didn't come here to sit on his hands. He's here to change the game. 

I compared GME to Chewy before but that's not quite an apples to apples comparison—because the vision for GME is a lot bigger than just an e-commerce platform. 

What GME can be is a multi-dimensional, vertically-integrated gaming ecosystem, combining the best assets of in-person, live local gaming & esports hub (plus all the accessories and gear they need) with a global gaming platform that enables the next generation of game developers to build immersive experiences for AR and VR universes on a massive scale.

We know some companies are going to come out winners in the coming AR/VR gaming revolution and eSports space. Why not Gamestop, a company with a national presence, a strong name brand, devoted customers and an active board that has absolutely every interest in growth and innovation?

Everyone seems to focus on the short squeeze, and not on the long thesis put forth by true GME bulls, like Keith Gill, who actually seems to be more on point as each development rolls in. Value this as a transformation play. You could be watching Amazon as an online bookseller, Apple as a desktop computer company getting crushed by IBM.  

We know how Amazon and Apple turned out. Is that possibility worth $190 a share? $400? You’re pricing in a lot of success at that point but why not? As stated, that market cap wouldn’t be outrageous— it would simply value the company among its current peers.

GME hasn’t shown it in the numbers yet but the numbers aren’t dire. And you should never invest based on what a company is worth today. This is not a dying company--with the debt wipeout, new management and a hungry board, the runway is clear to the future. I’m not going to question anyone buying seats on the jet right now."

Also as the the stock price goes up we def will see some small amounts of share dilution (this is a good thing if the cash is used for growth instead of paying down debts).  The fact the stock has been trading sideways the last few weeks despite the new shares should be the big news.  150$ may honestly be the new floor now that GME has basically wiped the slate clean in regards their past problems, and now has some cash left over to stay afloat with zero bad debt.

Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want to be short. But shorters will get out at a fair price. They can't be squeezed - i.e. forced into closing at an outrageous price - any more.

If you try to squeeze shorters by forcing the price up really high by excessive buying, GME will just exploit your dumb ass and flood the market with new float again.

Shorters don't win, Squeezers don't win. GME wins because they get to stay in business. And all that money poured in by hopeful idiots trying to engineer a squeeze? Good luck you just became LTBH investors in a retail store at an exhorbitant price.

Why downvote? Look at the authorisation. If you were GME and the price went up even a little further, wouldn't you print hella more shares? Use your brains people."

I will say that Amazon has many more resources than gamestop currently, but I don't hear any big news of them trying to expand into gaming, beside developing games that flop.

Gamestop is a household name at this point. I believe that it has a lot of room to grow and all the news about them and Cohen proves that. They are trying to expand beyond just video games. Things like pc parts, esports, tabletop gaming, etc are all high growth. I'm bullish."

Fact is, there's very little GameStop can bring to the table that a dozen other companies don't already provide. Chewy at the time was a niche product in a niche underdeveloped market. Gaming is an extremely ubiquitous product in an extremely developed market. There's simply not much room for differentiation in a profitable way. Competition is fierce, and the field is crowded."
2021-04-27 10:51:13,stocks,"lmao, what the fuck has Amazon done in the gaming space that Gamestop can't do?

Twitch is basically toeing the line of acceptability with their coomer/softcore streamer problem and Youtube (which is Google) have been pissing off creators for ages. Gamestop can target those weakness and pull in a lot of content creators with an aggressive affiliate program and some cashcup tourneys that require streaming on a GME supported platform.

In terms of gaming and accessories, Amazon hasn't done anything special either. I can find better prices and deals from Best Buy for games even with Prime. And I'm more likely to get authentic products rather than cheap mass produced chinese factory crap if I go to Gamestop or Best Buy.

Amazon has grown so big that they've basically tarnished their reputation. I look forward to when they'll collapse or be broken up into separate companies."

Anyone who thinks this is going to be a one-dimensional mall retailer in 2025 is sleeping. Cohen didn't come here to sit on his hands. He's here to change the game. 

I compared GME to Chewy but that's not quite an apples to apples comparison—because the vision for GME is a lot bigger than just an e-commerce platform. 

What GME can be is a multi-dimensional, vertically-integrated gaming ecosystem, combining the best assets of in-person, live local gaming & esports hub (plus all the accessories and gear they need) with a global gaming platform that enables the next generation of game developers to build immersive experiences for AR and VR universes on a massive scale.

We know some companies are going to come out winners in the coming AR/VR gaming revolution and eSports space. Why not Gamestop, a company with a national presence, a strong name brand, devoted customers and an active board that has absolutely every interest in growth and innovation?

Everyone seems to focus on the short squeeze, and not on the long thesis put forth by true GME bulls, like Keith Gill, who actually seems to be more on point as each development rolls in. Value this as a transformation play. You’re watching Amazon as an online bookseller, Apple as a desktop computer company getting crushed by IBM.  

We know how Amazon and Apple turned out. Is that possibility worth $190 a share? I’d argue yes. $400? You’re pricing in a lot of success at that point but why not? As stated, that market cap wouldn’t be outrageous— it would simply value the company among its current peers.

GME hasn’t shown it in the numbers yet but the numbers aren’t dire. And you should never invest based on what a company is worth today. With the debt wipeout, new management and a hungry board, the runway is clear to the future. I’m not going to question anyone buying seats on the jet right now."

Throw out any kind of turnaround, Gamestop right now is one of the most talked about companies in the world.  They will have an advantage on sentiment alone. People who don't even game or own their stock are captivated to see how this pans out and best believe they will buy a shirt, just based on popular culture alone.  Not saying that's reason for ""sky high valuation"" but every move they've made so far has been positive, and it's definitely not a $40 stock. Its just not."

Article is from 2008. The problem was known all those years ago, it just wasn't fixed. All they did was change some of the dates involved in FTDs. But they left the loopholes wide open.

Juicy tidbits: It quoted an article from 2005, that examined 341 proxy contests (shareholder voting). ""It found that there was evidence of overvoting in all 341 of the case."" (Naked shorts resulting in stock ""multiplicity"" being the source of the phantom shares causing the overvoting.) At that time, in 2008, they estimated a settlement fail rate of at least 24 percent for settlements using DTC's CNS process. They quoted the case of Global Links, Inc., who had ""27,000,000 delivery failures oustanding for company shares. This while Global Links authorized and issued shares stood at 1,100,000, or an amount of fails nearly 26 times the maximum float.""

This may help explain why Gamestop's millions of shares issued in the last month wasn't noticed, didn't cause a noticeable blip in the share value. Instead of diluting a true or real share float of 26 million or whatever, the 3.5 million was poured into a much, much larger combined pool of real+phantom shares, greatly in excess of the real shares. How much larger? Who knows, but with r/superstonk pushing all shareholders to register to vote, GameStop is probably going to get a *significantly* larger vote count this year. Significantly larger than its 70 or so million issued shares. And outstanding naked shorts are the source of the multiplicity of votes."

2021-04-27 17:21:24,stocks,"How do you KNOW it's not worth $70? GME no longer has any debt, has been implementing an E-Commerce transition, closed all unprofitable stores that were leases so there's no real estate to be losing money on, has grown the ecommerce division 191% YOY, has an E-Commerce pro at the helm bringing on former high level Chewy and Amazon execs to lead the transition, massive brand recognition and tons of visibility. 

There is an insane amount of value and if we follow E-Commerce P/E valuation this is an easy $1000 stock after a few more good quarters. Sorry you're about to get margin called but also you knew the risks so good luck, I hope you get out before shit really pops off."

The same goes for players in the stock market. Most are usually just gambling with no skill on little if any information.

Any turnaround is already priced in anyway, so who cares"
2021-04-27 06:14:44,stocks,"It is only a short squeeze if the shorts cover during the run up.  It is pretty clear that Melvin lied about covering at $77 - they lost $6 billion in January and that would imply that their short position was 115 million shares.  Much more likely that their short position was 15-20 million shares and they never covered.  
A short position of 15-20M combined with losses on expired OTM options in February would explain their published losses pretty closely."
2021-04-26 20:25:12,stocks,That was gamma squeeze
2021-04-26 20:32:16,stocks,"10$ a share was a very heavily shorted stock like the past months have proven, and i disagree. It was a huge run up in price but was it a squeeze ? I can agree that it has been hugely inflated at that point and would have squoze if they had not pulled illegal shit to stop the market, they even admitted themselves it would have gone in the thousands and higher if they hadn't done that. 

Let's all remember the last year too, 14Trillion of dollars added in the economy, TLSA went from 80$ in April to 400$ in 1 quarter, then it doubled again in another one... 

I would say, 40$ would have felt like a more correct price for GME last year, and yes when words went out about how much it was suppressed by shorts, it skyrocketed to be 12x that price, and i'm sure Melvin is still very happy about that, but we can't say it had a squeeze when we have seen all the market manipulation in this great 'Free' market."
2021-04-26 20:27:00,stocks,For sure. I think a lot of people are just talking about a massive price jump that trumps that 400$ ceiling. Dude im excited doe

Then why did they reduce their previous ATM offering from 6.5M to 3.5 ? :/"
2021-04-27 00:10:01,stocks,"They certainly can, but would they issue those shares? They’ve built a massive community of individuals who have an extreme sense of loyalty to the company. Ryan Cohen is clearly aware of this, look at what he’s been tweeting. Offering more shares would be financial suicide; they have enough cash to pivot their company and likely would lose much more in revenue and sentiment by offering more shares.

Retail has been picking up the shares. RC has been dripping them into the market slowly to allow regular people and possibly some institutions to pick up the shares, and they’re clearly not letting go. Sure, any of the possible smaller short players might have covered some, but even if you assume shorts got 100% of the 3.5M shares, it would be a drop in the bucket of whatever blown up positions funds like Citadel have and are trying to hide."

2021-04-27 00:00:45,stocks,"Just gonna throw this out as a small piece of advice. You gotta get your emotions in check. Emotions in trading are poison. Your comment screams you either can't handle the swings, or you had way way way too much on the line. Learn from that feeling and develop a better system of risk management. 

Anecdotally, I was in the exact same boat as you. Waking up early, freaking out during the day. Checking it every 10 minutes. I halved my position and all of that went away. I was obviously overweight in that position and needed to reallocate my risk. All this to say, you can still ride the ride as long as your risk tolerance keeps your emotions in check."
2021-04-27 08:10:41,stocks,"I sold off right near the peak in January, but got in late ($140). Sadly I didnt look into what was going on until then, or I'd have been in much earlier.

Bought an engagement ring for my gf with that money (only had a few shares), then started getting back in and accumulating  shares which I'm now gonna ride out.

Couldnt bring myself to liquidate all my holdings though. Since my hours got cut in August, and I'm living off $100/week while in school,  I've been using my investments as a safety net. Would be nice if GME took off though, since May is going to be a very expensive month"
2021-04-26 22:09:52,stocks,"Short interest is being hidden by failures to deliver that are being reset, kicking the can down the road. there’s plenty of DD showing it. They know publishing the real short interest is a recipe for disaster, so they’re hiding it this way. Plus ungodly amounts of shares moving around in dark pools (compared to any other stock, it’s a huge amount). There’s plenty of literature describing this process. 

And even without any SI, the market value of GME as an e-commerce company would put share price (lots of arguments here but reasonably) between $300-600. I’ve seen arguments for up to $1200 fair value, but I don’t agree, at least not yet. Compare to chewy, and other E-comm. they also just had the biggest free marketing campaign in the world from all the shenanigans, and have one of the most loyal fan bases of any company out there.

There is a lot of uneducated people giving input and upvoting things that are inaccurate, which to me scares away people because clearly a lot of the people don’t know what they’re talking about.

The algorithms has no emotion, rather they will need to be covered even if 1 stock is a lot $$.

And if you use Tianya (similar to Reddit) and can understand mandarin, there’s at least 20 million Chinese that have talked/interested/invest in GameStop. Whether they are day traders or long, that is yet to be known. Also, South Korea have also joined and they’re known as ants.

DTCC is insured for 70 trillion dollars, thus, 38 trillion is plausible provided that government doesn’t intervene.

1. Tik Tok has been valued at 50 Billion
2. FB is worth somewhere around 200 Billion to 700 Billion (in spite no longer in popularity)

In conclusion, it’s not delusional, rather what the market perceive value is and for GameStop, who’s float is well over 100%, it will be up to the government and the algorithms which have been put in place to cover."

2021-04-27 07:37:55,stocks,"I understand your point, and I can see Gamestop being able to do those things, but I have a couple of disagreements. 

With Amazon, even if they aren't very competitive in their gaming sector, they still hold an overwhelming market dominance over Gaming E-Commerce, and if they believe that Gamestop poses a threat to said dominance, they have the logistics and infrastructure along with many other resources that would beat Gamestop. Not to mention, transitioning to e-commerce for brick and mortar is a lot harder than most of them anticipate, and I think Gamestop is likely to face a dilemma on that front. Even with a new board experienced in e-commerce, Gamestop needs a lot of time to develop an e-commerce sector for their company which means taking out more capital and time. That's time you can't buy when your competition is far ahead of you in the e-commerce space. 

I can see your point about how Gamestop can expand to more niches like PC parts and tabletop gaming, and while they are already established names like Newegg in both product sectors, I do think Gamestop would be able to make a mark. But again, should Amazon see Gamestop as a threat to their market share in gaming e-commerce, they have the resources, capital, intelligence, logistics, and consumer ecosystem that would trounce Gamestop. That's mainly why we see most retailers get murdered by Amazon"

Amazon has spent years perfecting fast delivery, with strong infrastructure and logistics. A lot of brick and mortar who have been fighting with Amazon have tried to do the same thing as what you're saying here, but it never worked for them, and they got slaughtered by Amazon. Why? Even if they have a lot more stores, they still have to develop their logistics and intelligence that Amazon has in order to be a serious competitor with them. Problem is that it requires a shit ton of capital and time to do, and Amazon is already so far ahead in that department in the first place. I just can't see how this is going to be any different than any other time a retailer tried to go full e-commerce and failed."

Gamestop would be a fantastic fundamental buy if it's at 10-20 off of fundamentals, but the 200 range is pretty ridiculous, when you consider it didn't even reach those levels at its peak dominance in the Gaming industry. Unless you're buying for the theorized squeeze or day trading, I don't see how GameStop @ 200 is a fair valuation"

2021-04-27 07:03:16,stocks,They literally increased their balance sheet while people were buying the (suppressed) dip. It is like an Ace in the hole move.. Now they have no debt ( they paid it off weeks ago ) and they have a shit load of new money at market value for expansion.. I'm honestly surprised I didnt see this move coming.. but the fucking nuts on this dude.. as he tweets pictures of a teddy bear smoking pot.. Its Meme.. Its culture.. Its nostalgia.. and by god.. it is smart fucking business. He kills it.. and we're eating it up. New floor is 200 without a doubt. Squeeze or No.. we'll be 300 by july.
2021-04-26 22:51:05,stocks,"That's what I'm saying.  Even if you don't believe in the squeeze the long term potential has a ton of upside based on the moves Gamestop has already made. Even if you're not in it for the squeeze, the stock has a ton of potential to be higher than where its at now."
2021-04-26 23:21:35,stocks,I think you're confusing the perceived fair value of the company ($300-$400) with what people think the floor will be during the short squeeze. Nobody honestly thinks the company is going to be worth 10m a share on fundamentals alone lol
2021-04-27 10:28:29,stocks,"They don’t have enough money to buy any studios.

Not to mention that it is a completely different business, one in which they have no experience. And massive competition.

I’m not underestimating a good company. I’m properly estimating a company that was on its last legs for a reason. They did not adjust for a decade and have been steadily declining. They are finally doing something about it, have new execs, and due to a massive stoke of luck managed to wipe out their debt, but it may be too little too late. 

I have not even heard of a pivot plan, besides sell more stuff on line. Everything else is rank speculation from bag holders, half of these ideas don’t even seem profitable. They are a way behind their competitors in an industry with siloed distribution.

This is a classic mystery box scenario. People are excited because they haven’t given a plan, GameStop could become anything! Their plan will underwhelm everyone’s expectations though because everyone’s expectations are unreasonable."
2021-04-27 10:15:10,stocks,"So it’s not a 40 dollar because of hype and name recognition.

Got it.

I kinda agree with you though, it’s not a 40 dollar stock .... it’s 25.

2021-04-26 21:39:48,stocks,What restrictions
2021-04-26 22:59:05,stocks,Yes which they will likely do so like every company.  Gamestop's gonna need tons of capital to start growing once they can prove their current business model is profitable.  The next earnings is going to be super crucial to show that.

2021-04-26 20:47:05,stocks,">it’s clear that millions of individual buy orders are being routed through dark pools, then shorted on the NYSE in batches with identical volume

To be clear, if buy orders are being routed through dark pools it also means it’s being sold in the dark pool. You can’t literally just buy orders and conjure them out of nowhere. Nor can you “just sell” on a dark pool. Every transaction requires both a buyer and a seller.

>Every trading day, someone borrows 300,000-500,000 GME shares, as well as millions of ETF shares with GME in them.

Have you looked at this activity for other stocks too? Because this is completely normal. What you’d be looking for here is whether or not the borrowing premium is high or not. If it’s 1% or less the shares aren’t that scarce.

>If there aren’t an absolute ton of synthetics being shorted every day because the short hedge funds never closed out in January, then how else does the math possibly add up?

Because the sheer volume was more than enough for them to have covered and Melvin posted Q1 results. 53% loss for January is on the books- closed positions.

I’d also point out the February explosion was also a hedge fun blowing up the price via options. So they’re trying to both blow it up and keep it down? Makes zero sense from a short perspective. Just look at the big after hours spike tonight, it isn’t retail doing that.

It's a smart way to stop the bleed, if the barrow interest is less than 1%, which it was last I checked.

Example, Apple which is like the bluest of the blue chip tech stocks was trading between $125 and $135 for the longest time and most people thought that was a hard resistance. it fell down to like $116 at one point during the past couple months. GME could (probably will) swing even harder since it's hyped up on meme potential and Ryan's name and nothing more right now. (let's be real here, even if you're an avid believer there's no solid footing for the company right now) so you can't really say the volatility won't push it down to $100.

It's hard to find people who want a genuine conversation about why they believe it will/won't happen because theres so many extremes on both sides.

For example, a physical game i purchase will download to internal storage, and will run almost totally off internal.  The disc acts as a key that proves I currently have the license to use the game.  This is primarily due to speed concerns- internal storage on an SSD provides much faster load times.  

In my opinion the primary drivers for physical games are, as you mentioned, access to high speed downloads, and resaleability. By purchasing a physical i at least own a license for the game, which could be sold, lent, or transferred to another system/account."

2021-04-27 15:35:27,stocks,"*almost*,  Who is Gamestops direct competition? Anyone who is solid enough they could overtake gamestop? Or is it just a handful of e-comm / retailers who just so happen to sell video games. Sure, you can buy anything on amazon and Best Buy does sell video games but neither are trying to dominate the $150B video game industry. Gamestop is soley focused on that and getting a larger e-commerce platform which they are moving very very fast on. Already offer same day delivery. They've mentioned wanting to be more involved in e sports and already seeing reports from e sports teams that GameStop has reached out to them etc. Plenty of room for gamestop to grow, plenty of CASHHHHHH on hand to acquire more businesses. But what do I know I just like the company."
2021-04-27 19:31:07,stocks,"No one was arguing that it isn't necessary to profit. 

It has nothing to do with the fact that gamestop was a pariah amongst gamers before a people latched onto the idea they could get rich owning 8 shares."
2021-04-26 23:50:46,stocks,I'm with you on your conclusion there. I don't have any need to sell my shares right now.
2021-04-27 01:18:23,stocks,Luckily I have plenty of shares so I can hatch chickens as I need to

The stock will go up.
And studios are not that expensive. 
Specaily for android development. 

It's still unclear right now, yes. But if you really now the gaming industry. It's very profitable with high margins.

It's not a mystery box, it's a positive belive on Ryan Cohen.

Alot of new share holder believes in the company in the long run. And the moass is just the frosting on top.

Edit:I want to add, if the company didn't believe in its self, they would had used the current prices to dump millions in the market for a quick buck. Or insiders sold out."
2021-04-27 13:36:49,stocks,Actually that is how this works.  The market decides the price.  Right now as of typing this it's a $175 stock.  You think name recognition will have nothing to do with their success and direct leads to sales? Ok buddy.
2021-04-26 22:02:42,stocks,I think they’re restricted from acquisitions/mergers until paid off. Or at least a merger is seen less favorably with lots of debt.
2021-04-26 22:06:13,stocks,"If your company is in debt there’s certain things you can’t do. I’m not an expert there’s probably a zillion different kinds of debt, but GameStop specifically now that they’re debt free can issue dividends and complete mergers/acquisitions along with a few other things that I don’t remember off the top of my head."

2021-04-26 21:34:40,stocks,"Sentiment has changed though.

This time last year people fucking hated Gamestop for not letting their employees sanitize demo stations in their stores.

It's a complete piece of garbage. The website looks like it was made in 2008. The inventory and navigation systems suck dick. Half the time you can't even find what you're looking for. 

Gamestop has a long way to go if they want to arrive in 2021."
2021-04-26 21:06:32,stocks,">Because the sheer volume was more than enough for them to have covered and Melvin posted Q1 results. 53% loss for January is on the books- closed positions.

2021-04-27 01:26:48,stocks,"Honestly, the other guy who mentioned it was a bit cringe but Roaringkitty is your best bet. GME is an incredibly speculative play, and as such, nobody with a reputation to uphold is going to recommend people buy into the stock. 

However, there is an *absolute fucking plethora* of DD for you to comb through for yourself, and if you’re as smart as you like to pretend, it shouldn’t be an issue for you to refute any of the evidence, or at least discern the credible claims from the bullshit. I don’t understand why it’s so necessary that people spoon feed you the information from some reputable source when you can read through DD *in which “anonymous” sources still cite where they got their info*.

But, again, since you want to be a lazy wanker about it, I would recommend RoaringKitty. He’s really the only person who might fit into your bullshit purist criteria."

2021-04-27 01:06:39,stocks,"It’s all self reported and cannot be checked.  My experience with short interest data is the reporting is all over the place depending upon the source you consult.  This further calls into question whether we can rely on these reporting agencies for this data.  And .... 20% short interest, if the FINRA info is correct, is still sufficient for a squeeze of some sort.  That’s worst case scenario.  Short interest is prob higher."

Risk vs reward. Literally every stock in the market is a huge risk. They are all manipulated. 
Hedge funds take money from almost every investor in the market. 

Sure if you do your homework and have a little luck to be in at the right time you can avoid some hedge fund fuckery. But they will get you at some point, they always do. Its a rigged game. 
So ill play the odds on a stock that the hedge funds dropped the ball on and bit off more than they can chew."

2021-04-27 09:38:06,stocks,"I tried reasoning with the bear perspective but the argument is DOA. If the shorts did cover, why isn't GameStop bankrupt yet? Why is there a heavy mainstream media campaign to suppress any good news about the company? The premise behind the bear argument is related to GameStop going insolvent, and with all the recent changes, that point is moot. And the source material is from Reddit, but comes from the GameStop filing related to the float for the upcoming shareholders meeting.

I need to deliver 120M shares (conservatively).  I buy 50% of 3.5M shares (if that, I doubt they're buying in any significant quantity right now, I don't think they can afford to).  Have I covered or am I still about to get turbodicked into the ground?"
2021-04-26 22:49:04,stocks,They issued 3.5m more shares and the SharePrice is still above 150s 😆 GME needs a 1500 PE like ZM
2021-04-26 23:02:42,stocks,"During the MOASS, literally pretty much any price IS possible. Theoretically. It just depends on how many people hold out. I personally don’t think $1m will happen, but it is possible. I just don’t think emotionally people can hold out when seeing that kind of money. But who knows, maybe people really do have it in them to hold. 10k-100k I really think is possible and likely during the MOASS if there’s no intervention. 

My comments $300-$600 are fair market price, not squeeze price. So if you don’t believe in the squeeze and think it’s over, in my opinion it’s still a good investment. That was my point."

Could say that about literally any stock/asset ever, why didn’t the “pros” do it right? Why did hedges short the shit out of Tesla pre-split at a few hundred? People are wrong sometimes.

And to say the DTCC/SEC whoever you want to mention doesn’t know, that’s not definitely true, you have no idea. It DOES appear they’re trying to get the pieces in to place to survive when shit blows up. Clearly they can’t publicly acknowledge it or else everyone ever would jump on, making the issue even worse."
2021-04-26 23:31:33,stocks,"Regarding it not being worth right now, I cannot understand that line of thinking. They have 5b yearly rev, a great team across the board now, a viable vision, somewhere between $500-1b in cash, no debt.  $100/share is $7B cap, which is barely over 1x rev + cash. 

Of course anything can happen at any point, but my point stands that I don’t think it’ll ever go that low, and I think that’s extremely reasonable. But yeah, I know never say never. Any stock could blow up any day for whatever reason. That’s just a risk of investing."

Headsets/peripherals

They’re moving towards being similar to a Best Buy or frys, but more gamer focused. And before you say that “that market is already taken blah blah” tell me which of these dominate E-commerce, because as far as I’m concerned their e-commerce is all shit, their websites are shit, support is shit. Chewy.com approach to the sector. 

E-sports is growing extremely rapidly, and they’re getting involved in that scene too. The stores that they decided to keep open, they’re testing turning into e-sports gaming centers or whatever you want to call it. Look at the concept photos."

Just wondering, what is a typical revenue to stock price relationship for a company?"
2021-04-27 02:04:29,stocks,"Well while that value seems “big” and trading at 1x revenue makes it seem like a reasonable price, they’ve had negative growth since 2017.

GameStop annual revenue for 2021 was $5.09B, a 21.28% decline from 2020.

GameStop annual revenue for 2020 was $6.466B, a 21.96% decline from 2019.

GameStop annual revenue for 2019 was $8.285B, a 3.06% decline from 2018.

If you plot their revenue from 2005 to today they’re an upside down parabola about halfway down the other side.

While the hope is that Ryan reverses the downward trend their trend line doesn’t justify a stock price of 1x revenue and cash. If that was a hard floor for every company regardless of how they’re performing that would be a huge safety net. Kinda like buying a SPAC at $10. You’d never lose money if you buy a stock at 1x revenue."

And again that's assuming a squeeze even happens, somehow, despite short interest being down from an unprecedented 140+% in January to its current mediocre level

Gamestop is better off than they were 6 months ago but no fundamental analysis gets anywhere close to justifying the price, let alone a multiple of it. Can I see your figures on that?

How close is GME to Amazon’s logistics model? Entirely not started. Those ex employees can’t just bring over the tech and software from a previous company, this all needs to be built and deployed while either licensing Amazon’s logistics (unlikely) or another huge infrastructure investment. So yes they now have no debt, but for how long?

For GME to compete, they’ll need to create a new POS across all of their stores at a minimum, with better access to real time inventories, and an entire shipping channel they don’t have. Are they just going to use UPS and FedEx for their two hour delivery, when UPS and FedEx both don’t have programs to support that? Are they going to do an Uber-like last-mile delivery which has been a constant money loser? How many years was Amazon laughed at for making minimum profit? Are you going to sit through a decade of GME growth without stock gains? Because these are all possible. The squeeze thesis has been too muddied, and I don’t see that as an option anymore. What we do have is a very committed base of new-to-the-market investors holding up the floor. What happens if a year from now, GME is in worse debt and the sales numbers aren’t matching up to these overhyped expectations?

I support GME and am part of WSB, was in GME from December of last year and honestly I’m fully out. The squeeze has squozen, but there is lots of potential for sure. But if you’re asking my honest opinion, your two sentence DD isn’t good enough, imho."

But for example, 70m shares at 10k each is $700b. @ 100k it’s 7T. That could be paid out, no one will be happy about it but it COULD be.

These prices are not based on fundamentals of stocks they are based on outlying events, i.e. a short squeeze. There have been several discussions on this that can't be paraphrased here but suffice it to say the demand for shorted stock is likely between 133-900% based on failure to deliver and ITM calls and married puts.

The price anatomy of a short squeeze with very little volume will create astronomical prices: I doubt there has been a stock shorted more, ever. Unless shorts would like to go to jail they will be margin called and they will be liquidated at market price until all margin is covered. Since apes are holding the price will rise (supply and demand) until enough apes still sell. It will be a high number.

As far as money in existence, and the supply of money. We all know the fed has turned of m1 m2 and m3 money supply data and ultimately they will print money to bail out this fiasco. Hopefully the SEC will jail some folks too.

I'm uneducated yet you're essentially saying ""ignore all your well-established financial data, some guys on the internet wrote things that I'd rather believe in"". Because aside from some posts on Reddit - that you have faith in but apparently can't even summarize - all the numbers point to a much lower short interest than January. Not enough to squeeze, and certainly not enough to extract an impossibly large amount from

My god, man. **I understand what a short squeeze is**. I'm making two separate points to address each of the arguments you made - on the true value of GME, and the potential short squeeze value. I'm saying I think buying now for either reason is erroneous. Neither the fundamentals nor the squeeze potential is enough to justify buying. ($198 is heavily inflated) 

GME is also most definitely not a low volume stock, and retail owns a relatively trivial amount. So shorts can just go around you guys easily 

I made money on the actual squeeze, back when it was a fundamentally sound play. That was as close to ""too good to be true"" as I've ever seen in finance, and even then, ultimately, it was 

This seems futile. You're so many layers deep in these interwoven theories and narratives that we're just working with an entirely different set of facts now. You can't explain anything because you'd have to explain the other 27 manifestos that built up to that point first; and I can't explain anything because you've already dismissed all the official numbers

*To my knowledge*, ETF shorting isn’t an integral factor to the squeeze by any means. It certainly helps, in that it would mean they’re shorting an even more exorbitant amount of shares than what’s being reported, but even ~25% SI is pretty significant, especially if retail does actually happen to hold more shares than the entire float (which seems likely, I can provide sources if you’d like). So (correct me if I’m wrong) even if we assume that there’s absolutely no shorting through ETFs whatsoever, a squeeze still isn’t improbable - it’s just one more factor that puts the odds in GME holders’ favour. 

>frankly none of the GME holders are doing tHe rEsEaRCH to understand anything, they’re just blindly following others that also aren’t doing their homework

Well, this seems like a bit of an unfair generalization. Absolutely, there are tons of people out there who are just blindly trusting in the possibility of a short squeeze. There are even tons of people who blindly trust the DD with little knowledge of the mechanisms behind it (I’m somewhat part of this camp). But there’s also *extensive* research being done on the stock. I’m sure there’s plenty of misconceptions and faulty research, but to simply say that *nobody is doing their homework* is just plain wrong.

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Monthly Income From Dividends - Building a portfolio to maximise returns for reinvestment every month. Hello everyone,

I’ve basically been working on trying to build a monthly income from high yielding monthly paying dividends and just wanted some clarification on workings and whether the below would work. 

I have downloaded a spreadsheet of all the monthly dividend paying companies, and work out the best value for money based on dividend yield and price. 

Appreciate there will be some price differences between the below and current as this was put together some time ago. I also understand that dividend payments can change and price fluctuations could effect income and P/L. I also understand that using this method may not draw out the ‘best’ companies. 

OXSQ - $4.65 - 9% Yield ($0.04 Monthly) - $13,953 - 3001 Shares
PBA - $28.54 - 6.9% Yield ($0.22 Monthly)- $15,599 - 547 Shares
PFLT - $11.98 - 9.5% Yield ($0.09 Monthly) - $15,914 - 1328 Shares
PSEC - $7.81 - 9.2% Yield ($0.057 Monthly) - $16,388 - 2098 Shares
AGNC - $16.89 - 8.5% Yield ($0.115 Monthly) - $17,551 - 1039 Shares
DX - $18.97 - 8.5% Yield ($0.128 Monthly) - $17,805 - 939 Shares

So does this mean for roughly $97,000 I can get paid roughly $720 per month?

**I’m from the UK so it basically translates to £71k for roughly £570 per month.**

The plan is to slowly build the portfolio, one stock at a time achieving the total number of shares to provide roughly £100pm, reinvesting the dividends as I go. I will eventually (if achieved) continue to add more ‘secure companies’ paying monthly/quarterly dividends stocks (AT&T Etc). 

Just wanted to know peoples thoughts, risks, advantages / disadvantages and whether this would be feasible. 

Thanks!"

&#x200B;

I am up 44% on an annual basis YTD in 2021.

&#x200B;

I use technical's to buy near low troughs sell near high peaks, get the 7% dividend ($0.52 per quarter) while also selling covered calls against the shares. I recently sold (4/22/2021) all 11100 shares and am back to 100% cash waiting for the next trough which with the -$0.49 decline today is the start. Will start purchasing AT&T shares again near $30 for the next cycle."
2021-04-26 21:15:32,stocks,BMO has been very good to me.

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Full growth, high risk I’ve decided to go after growth holdings and increase my risk. I’ve concentrated my portfolio down to 20 growth stocks such as Square, Roku, Sea Limited, Pinterest, etc...

Also in my portfolio are about 30 shares of SPY that I bought when I first started investing years ago. If I want to go down this growth approach, should I sell my SPY ETF and distribute my value across the 20 growth stocks?"

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"As someone who started their investment portfolio in January 2021, I have finally broken even today I have been following the stock market very peripherally for a few years now.

When the COVID pandemic happened and stocks tumbled, that made sense to me. What did not make a whole lot of sense was the unbelievable ascent that took place immediately after.

I’m a grad student and so I don’t have a job at the moment (will graduate next month though and finally start earning money hopefully), so I couldn’t risk putting my savings in the markets and instead I sat on the sidelines watching everybody make a ton of money except me.

By the end of 2020, I said enough was enough and decided that it was time to stop watching and finally start my own investment portfolio. That was my New Years resolution and by the middle of January I had finished my due diligence on all the companies and stocks I wanted to buy and I moved two-thirds of all the cash I had in my name into the stock market...

It was a very good few weeks for me after that, and then February happened...

I felt like such a dumbass for watching all the gains take place and then as soon as I moved my money in a correction took place. Of course I was overweight on tech and growth and so I was down about 12% of my investments all within the first 4 weeks of when I started trading.

It was definitely a gut punch and made me question if I actually knew anything at all about stocks, but I knew that selling would be stupid so I just waited.

It was hard not checking my Fidelity app every single day, but I’m happy to say that today I’m finally back to where I started. I could sell it all right now and it would be as if I had just kept all my money in my savings account this entire time.

It really is true what they say, stocks take the elevator down and the stairs up."
2021-04-26 21:40:15,stocks,"It’ll be another 4 months before you make any money, stick to the plan."

2021-04-27 00:00:08,stocks,"Consider yourself lucky. I went in on mostly growth stocks in mid-Feb. They're just now starting to come around. I've got a little ways to go to break even, but at least I'm optimistic now."
2021-04-27 00:21:26,stocks,"It happens, this is why as a growth investor I personally hold a large allocation of cyclicals / reflationary beneficiaries. Barbell stocks have worked for the past year and just might be the move for 2021."
2021-04-26 21:53:34,stocks,"Don’t be down. Just 3 weeks ago I made my full year technically( one stock until December then I started buying more) a had a gain of 6.25%. So I started selling and consolidating( probably had 20-30 stocks). Now I’m down to 10 stocks and my 1 year gain is at 27.47% up 20% from just last week. After February I was RED too after seeing jolly GREEN for those few weeks. Thought, “ oh man, this is easy and fun”. Nahhhh"
2021-04-26 21:57:56,stocks,"I started in the waning days of January and my Roth just broke even today. I bought QCLN on 2/10 at ATH and that is still dragging me down, but my other ETFs have finally picked it up. My stock account is trending in the right direction too. Down (up?) to only -10%."

The other thing is that it’s difficult to put more money into your stocks that are the most in the red. Like yeah, you’re dollar cost averaging down, but also, you’re putting more money overall into your poor performers. You really need to have a lot of conviction. I tried my best to do it when I could

What really hurt me were the ARK funds and some clean energy and EV plays. Other than that I feel like I made smart investment decisions. I still like the ARK funds and clean energy and I plan to keep them for the long run regardless, but they’re still in the red right now and it’s gonna take a while for those to be green. At least my overall portfolio is on the right side of zero at this moment."
2021-04-27 03:44:47,stocks,Goal for what is Wednesday/Thursday.
2021-04-27 03:20:14,stocks,Your strategy is sound.  This however will break down if you were the victim of some of the pump and dumps earlier this year.  Weed stocks were a huge trap for many people.  I watched it unfold and it was horrible for people stuck with -30% or worse positions that haven't recovered at all.  These were notorious late market day pumps with peaks early after hours and massive crash late after hours and next day price significantly lower at premarket open than previous market close.  People were trapped by trading hours availability.  Averaging down in these cases is difficult and demoralizing.
2021-04-27 07:58:49,stocks,Dude this sounds great and what I try to do of decent IV stocks but that are consistently volatile by a certain amount. Though I’m much like OP started in Jan and currently down the 1.6% because of FOMO and getting suckered by Reddit hype.

2021-04-27 07:56:38,stocks,"Yeah. My original portfolio had way too many deadweight picks and gassed up Reddit/online stocks I bought with no fundamental gameplan of my own for them. Buying stuff cause everyone shouts you should without getting how you could stand to benefit and what your strategy you should implement is an easy fast track to big losses. 

I've since parted with a lot of the clutter dragging me down and consolidated into a more condensed and refined set of positions I actually like/understand and have a strategy for. I have now been more steadily coming back and have actual confidence long term now as well. Opportunity cost is a thing. Holding something you don't know why you bought will cause you to miss opportunties you could more effectively pursue. 

You only HODL if the issues a stock is currently having doesn't change the basis for why you bought it or if you *really* need to free up some cash and it's your most pragmatic option."
2021-04-27 03:12:37,stocks,"If you have funds invested and share count and you see slightly bullish sentiment, you can always take a measured risk and sell covered calls on your investment.  

The risk of a covered call is to lose the chance on further upside beyond the strike price + premium.  The benefit is that you will gain the premium in all situations.  If you get assigned because market price moved up to or past the strike, you'll sell at a relative profit as compared to when you sold the call.  You can always re-enter if the market price hasn't moved beyond the premium gap.   You can set your own risk tolerance by picking farther out strike prices.  I believe this falls under the theory of Theta Gang and wheeling, just not doing the puts part that gets you shares.  

This is of course if the securities you are invested in have options available.  Watch out for commissions on options too before you venture too far into this."
2021-04-27 11:39:47,stocks,"Ark costs too much. I'd rather invest in a nasdaq 100 index.

If you're new I'd say find your diversity in an index and only pick 1 or 2 stocks that you're willing to do heavy DD in. Your should have complete understanding of a company in order to buy when it's red. If you can't get yourself to buy when a stock is down a couple points you'll probably end up selling at the worse times.

You can also just hold what you have so you can look back a year or two from now to see what happens."
2021-04-26 20:05:51,stocks,Absolutely! Don’t panic sell ever!
2021-04-27 07:20:54,stocks,get back to break even
2021-04-27 15:56:49,stocks,"Right. I see your logic with that. I would be Pinocchio if I said that’s never happened to me because it has. The learning curve on the market is just sooooo big, something new everyday type deal. I don’t deal with anything that I don’t do my DD on and use my instinct to decide on investing or sitting by and just keeping an eye on a particular one. I’ve been very happy with how I’ve played it to this point... all it takes is a really bad couple weeks to ruin that.
When I first started in this game, you could have just called me king paper hands. Constantly panic selling to try and minimize my losses. Well, that’s fine and dandy, but I’ve been a victim of stolen shares. I refuse to use stop loss for anything at all just to watch it fall right below my stop and then literally bounce right back up past my original price. MMs are a fucking joke and I’m basically trying to play their game to the best of my knowledge."
2021-04-27 07:58:23,stocks,Exactly. The stocks u currently have I will keep holding in a downturn because I have bought them because I think they are solid companies with good future prospects.

What do you think about these news? Does this change your opinion about Tesla in the long run? What about short term views? These news are positive with the earnings beat, but I’d like to hear your opinions. The revenue miss hurts, but I feel like the earinings beat is still a good thing obviously."
2021-04-26 21:59:11,stocks,"Clearly most if not all of the new cars sold in 15 years will be EVs.  Whether Tesla sells a lot of them or not, depends on many years of gains against well established players that already know how to manufacture and sell 6-8 mm cars per year.  Unfortunately Tesla is already priced assuming they are selling that many cars right now and they aren't.  I think we can be damned certain that GM, VW group and the Japanese will still be selling that many, we don't yet know about Tesla.  Right now any of the others is a better stock buy than Tesla simply due to Tesla's outlandish valuation."
2021-04-26 21:01:56,stocks,I really like Tesla as a company. If the valuation wasn't absurd I'd definitely be on board.
2021-04-26 20:16:22,stocks,"TSLA will be fine. probably will give people a good buying opportunity in the immediate term as the revenue miss is already dropping the price in after hours.

2021-04-27 00:00:40,stocks,"Earnings number alone doesn’t tell the full picture.

Earnings from speculation is worth a 1x multiple, i.e neither reliable or recurring.

earnings from credits is also not indefinite, therefore is worth a single digit multiple

Unfortunately at this point Tesla is only profitable because of credits and speculation.

While they are growing, it remains to be seen when they will become profitable on recurring and reliable revenue and how far their growth continues"

Let’s guess for fun …

Someone will have figured out solid state batteries and selling them to anyone. Every brand will have the same battery tech, Tesla loses one of its past selling points (we can argue it already did, if we look at real world range tests).

New charging networks expand in the US. Tesla partially loses its selling point there of the best charging network.

Competition will be strong, huge variety of cars in different styles for a variety of use cases and tastes at all price points. City cars, luxury cars, cheap cars, grandma cars, off road, sports, lunar landers, tricycles, whatever.
Different people want different and unique things, variety has never been Tesla’s strength, competition gains market share.

China pushes to sell its own brands internally, in its bid to overtake America has the tech and economic leaders.
Europeans go back to prefer European cars now that they have the choice.

The EV fad exhausts itself. Families aren’t going to buy twice more cars ten years forward that they did ten years past.
Investors move over to inflate the next stupid thing. Like, a new coffee-maker technology and the market is flooded by coffe related IPOs and everyone bets on coffee. Or fruit juice (Juicero!). Or railways, whatever.

Elon dedicates more of his attention to rockets, Mars, brain interfaces, whatever new exciting thing he fancies.

Self driving? Have seen the movies. Don't think TSLA will hold the edge.

My predication;

* Elon will cash out on TSLA nicely
* Big brands are gaining in the electric vehicle market, quality is higher, lot's of money to spend on safety aspects that will become more relevant (saw the fire accidents of EV's where the battery ignited? This is like petrol cars in the 50's - it won't be acceptable once the electric vehicle market share becomes more dominant).
* Self driving of TSLA is immature. It will be replaced by other technologies with safer working and newer technology that TSLA does not believe in, LIDAR and other developments that have yet to come.
* Elon will say he achieved what he wanted, he transformed the fosil fuel burning car market into an electric one (always his goal - he claimed it in the past - he won't care shit about shareholders). He will start to focus on his other projects. Hand over TSLA to someone else to steer. Walk away and have new innovations for us to become enthusiastic about.

What specialty does TSLA have at this stage that big brands with huge piles of money can't easily replicate and for sure improve upon? I don't see it - except for Elon - he is awesome - but not for money making companies - mainly for innovation."
2021-04-27 04:47:00,stocks,The more cars they sell the more regulatory credits they can receive as long as other car companies are continuing to produce ice vehicles. It's not part of the core business but it is a product of them growing the electric vehicle space. When they eventually get phased out it they will have greater economies of scale and far more revenue coming in that it wouldnt be a significant portion. It's ironic that Teslas competitors are literally paying Tesla and helping them grow their business.

I’m glad you think their energy sector will keep losing money. Which is highly unlikely. The move to electric cars will increase demand for electricity and the demand for clean energy likewise. Their business is an eco-system which Elon said as much yesterday without saying it’s an eco system. So Tesla in turn will be profiting off other electric cars indirectly. I don’t get why their energy sector losing money is even a thing you brought up, like the point is do you see the growth or not. You don’t, but it losing money is only temporary in my opinion. 

Their mega battery packs they sell. Solar energy. Which is all packed into their energy sector. Tesla is positioning themselves for the additional demands in electricity. Which they will be no doubt once we go fully electric. 

There’s also their investment in bitcoin.

Their self-driving tech. Which no doubt doesn’t have to power all cars but in my opinion will be powering more cars than just Tesla in my opinion. 

The things I’ve noticed about other car companies is that they are building cars, the software is behind. Tesla’s software is way ahead.

Yeah, and Porche also has this type of margins, they are very expensive cars and make up on that margin by offering tons of extremely expensive customization. Not exactly an apples to apples comparison.

>Even Toyota’s gross margin is higher than 20%.

>Op margin of 12% is better than Tesla’s 5.7%

I see that being claimed [here](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TM/toyota/profit-margins), but i am not sure how they arrive at those numbers. Looking at sale and cost [on page 7 here](https://global.toyota/pages/global_toyota/ir/financial-results/2021_3q_summary_en.pdf) they are at ~15% gross margin. Operating margin is around 7-8% historically, [page 20.](https://global.toyota/pages/global_toyota/ir/financial-results/2021_3q_presentation_en.pdf) 

And it is well known thing that automakers often sell cars with razor thin margins and make up for it on service, i am sure decoupling it from the numbers above would give a much lower margin than even 15%. Lexus is a more expensive brand with higher margins pushing the average up as well. 

So yeah, while Tesla is a more premium brand still (average fleet price as of now is just 38k though) it is pretty close apple to apple comparison, atleast far more than Ferrari or Porsche."

Analysts expect $2.88 of GAAP EPS for 2021 (Tesla has beaten analyst estimates 4 out of the last 5 quarters), which at current prices would be a P/E of 250, and Tesla will likely more than double earnings in 2022 and keep growing fast thereafter much like Amazon, which by the way, followed the same trend in P/E and was above 1000 and over the years has declined and settled in the 70-80 range due to their continued growth. 

The part about Tesla needing 540 million vehicles to justify their valuation is total bullshit. First, Ford is worth $47 billion in market cap, but once you add all their net debt, their enterprise valuation is $115 billion. Ford also lost money last year and hasn’t had an operating margin as high as Tesla’s since 2014. Ford is also not a growing business, it is in secular decline, and although they just released an EV, they are way behind on EVs which will represent a majority of the market within the decade. By the way, every EV Ford sells is one less gasoline car they sell, and their EV is not and will not be more profitable than their gasoline cars for a while, so guess what that does to a their finances. Other legacy automakers are suffering from similar trouble as Ford too. Not to mention that they don’t have a diversified business in energy like Tesla does nor can they ever even dream of selling a $10k pure margin software package like Tesla does on their cars.

The problem with that kind of reasoning is that reasoning by analogy is always less accurate than looking at the facts.

Yes, it's true that keeping a 50% annual growth for 10 years is much harder than hitting it for a few years. But that's not what's going on here, Tesla is growing 100% this year and potentially next year as well, so they don't need to maintain their growth to hit an annualized 50% growth throughout the decade. If they hit 100% in these two years while they have 2 factories coming online that are each bigger than their existing 2 combined, they only need to grow 40% in the next 8 years to still reach an annualized growth rate of 50% throughout the decade.

So yes, in reality it will look more like 100% this year and going down 10% each year to reach peak production near the end of the decade, but the annualized growth will be close to 50%.

> No, it has a high p/e because of crazy investors who have bought into hype.

That's not a fact. You are again reasoning by analogy. ""This has never happened before so it can't happen now"" is the best way to miss opportunities in the market.

> It has a market cap 3x the size of toyota, where is it going to grow? I doubt it is going to be 50% of the world car market place. Even if you buy that it is going to be worth 3x the price of toyota why would anyone buy tesla stock because it is all already priced in.

The vaccine they are working on is suppose to be different than the current ones with the activation of t-cells mainly to create a long term immunity. Take a look tell me what you think. It is just a matter of time before the next news comes.

2021-04-27 14:15:33,stocks,"> Why does news of a stock split cause the price to pop?

1. in some cases, it puts a lesser known company on people's radars. (not relevant in this case, but definitely was relevant for expi)
2. fractional shares aren't available on all brokerages/all countries, meaning a lower buy in price makes the company more accessible to more people
3. if someone wants to sell covered calls, they need 100 shares. lowering the barrier of entry from close to $350k down to like 13k will have a whole new group of people buying the stock that otherwise wouldn't have. lower prices can increase demand, which in turn raises the prices."

Today my question is about International Market Data APIs. I was informed of a few yesterday (Alpha Vantage, Factset, etc.) Do either of these have the ability of providing quotes for securities listed internationally (in several countries)? 

Example: [https://www.tradingview.com/](https://www.tradingview.com/) 

If you look up a security (Alibaba for example) on their website, you are able to find the price of that security in several countries it is listed in (Russia, China, U.S., etc.).

Roblox is more of a SaaS than a publisher. They provide and maintain a service, which for the most part is a finished product that needs maintenance.

Take Two is a publisher with a wide variety of product ranges, which is a good business model, but expensive. I haven’t looked at the numbers, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they generate more revenue than Roblox, but the revenue/expense ratio alone could make the profit pale by comparison.

They were put in my parents name.  We found the actual stock certificates after going through some old boxes.   Apparently in 2016 the state I live in (Virginia) sold the stock as there are some laws that say(I'm terribly paraphrasing as I don't understand this at all) if nothing was done with the stock and it was deemed inactive, ownership of the stock is given to the state of the last known residence of the original owner.  We called the state office and they told us to fill out a bunch of paperwork and submit it to the state to see what can be done about recouping some of the funds from the sale.  

Sorry if this is not the right place for this post or if it doesn't make sense lol I'm just trying to find some answers.  Some friends of mine mentioned that with the Disney stock splits back in the 90s those 24 shares could have turned into a decent amount of cash.  I appreciate any insight you all could provide!

Edit: I'm looking at them now.  The 8 shares bought in 1992 were purchased in December of that year so post split and the 16 shares purchased in 1998 were purchased on July 9th of that year.  So would that mean the 8 from 1992 would have turned into 24 in 1998 and the 16 bought in 1998 look like they missed the split by like 3 weeks (lol god dammit) for a total of 40 shares in 2016 when the state sold them?"

2021-04-27 00:57:02,stocks,"What exactly makes it ""inactive?""  What should have been done with the shares?  I have plenty of stocks I haven't touched in years.  What is the caveat to enact the escheatment?  Was there some warning that would have been sent prior to seizing that was missed by the family?  Curious and trying to make sure never to end up in a similar situation."
2021-04-27 01:35:01,stocks,"From Wikipedia--

""Escheatment is the process of returning lost or unclaimed property to the government of a State, for safekeeping until the owner(s) is identified. Geographic jurisdiction of the State is determined by the last known address of the original owner. Each of the United States has laws regulating escheatment, with holding periods typically ranging around five years. The legal principle behind escheatment is that all property has a legally recognized owner; therefore, if the original owner cannot be found within a specified time, government is presumed to be the owner.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escheat#cite_note-5)

Escheats are performed on a revocable basis. Thus, if property has escheated to a State but the original owner subsequently is found, escheatment is revoked and ownership of the property reverts to that original owner.""

Whether that means you're entitled to the shares (and any subsequent splits) or the value at the time of escheatment is a good question and may vary from state to state.

I've recovered property from my home state (which is not VA) without much problem.  The largest were a checking account my late father had that I didn't know about, and an insurance refund for auto insurance paid as of his date of death.  The point being that you may be able to recover at least the value of the shares as of thedate of escheatment."

Really?

Did the whole recover my unclaimed money through my state treasury department website fiasco like 3 times. Little bits just kept seeping in over the years. Very very annoying."
2021-04-27 17:33:09,stocks,sooooo how does a state deem shares to be inactive? isnt the point of shares that you can buy them and hang on to them? They expected you to check in and confirm you're still alive every so often?
2021-04-26 20:15:09,stocks,Fuck them for this bullshit. You should definitely sue for every dollar. They tell us all to long term invest then steal our investment for no activity??? Unreal.

2021-04-26 21:34:05,stocks,I don’t think the value of a stock changes after splits. It’s the number of shares. If it was bought after the split and your grandparents wanted to buy say $ 100 worth of stocks it would still be worth the same in total before or after the split.

2021-04-26 21:18:16,stocks,"They thought everyone in your family was dead.

The default in most states for estates is they pass to children, then grandchildren, then parents, then maybe siblings or cousins, then the state. If nobody is claiming assets, the state just takes them and spends them but holds a ledger entry for them and waits a decade or three to see if anyone claims them, then lines out the ledger entry and tells any future claimants ""you snooze, you lose.""

This is why you write a will giving your stuff to someone other than the state. Unless you love the state so much you want them to have it."

The point of fact is, someone bought stocks, their address was associated with said stocks, stocks are meant to be long term investments so they left them alone (you are under no obligation to do ANYTHING with your property, especially if it should continually gain value in the long term), and then, without being contacted at all, their property was sold out from under them to no longer gain value. 

It's literally stealing with more steps and time. Why should a state have a right to sell your property without even attempting contact with you first? They have his parents address!

Like seriously, it doesnt matter if they bury the money and never use it. The point is they are forcing you to now jump through extra steps in order to get that money that they never should have touched in the first place."

Mimedx (MDXG) My largest holding reports earnings this week with a conference call Thursday morning before Market open. Mimedx has developed Best in Class advanced wound care products from dehydrated human amnion chorion membrane (dHACM) derived from donated placental tissue. With respect to Advanced wound care applications, these products are used to care for difficult to heal diabetic foot ulcers/venous foot ulcers, and for the repair of surgical and other hard to heal wounds (including amputations, dental extractions, and for healing burns without or with only minimal scarring). Reimbursement for Mimedx advanced wound care products was recently approved by the nation's  largest commercial  payor, United Health.

Mimedx is a turnaround play, with an entirely new Board and Management and their Advanced wound care products with 85% gross margins are alone worth the price of admission. But the real potential gamechanger for this company is its micronized injectable products for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions.  Phase IIb trial for knee osteoarthritis and Phase III trial for plantar fasciitis are underway with data expected soon. All indications are that the data will show meaningful efficacy with no adverse risks. Other potential indications include shoulders, elbows, hips, etc. Medically, this is an area of great unmet need and Mimedx's Amniofix Injectable product has been given Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation status by the FDA wifh the potential to speed up the approval process. The potential market for these products, if approved, is in the billions annually. 

Again, 1st quarter earnings and conference call for any updates on the injectable product approval process is on Thursday. Mimedx is currently trading just above its 50 day moving average of $10.43 and today's pullback may be a great opportunity for a trade or long-term investment entry point, with a stop limit set below the 50 day moving average (give it a little room or you may be stopped out early).

I bought PLTR to be the cornerstone of my long term portfolio (about 50% total) and intended to hold it indefinitely. Over the last few months I have begun to feel that they are perhaps already overvalued and I would be better off in a stock that is more well known and more widely understood. 

With their earnings report due in mid May how close to the actual release should I get before I sell? I'm guessing the small gains it is making daily right now are investors 'pricing in' the news already. 

I do have a number in mind and if it hits I will sell regardless, but to be honest I would be happy to get out at my break even point and would rather see a smaller gain then end up waiting a week too long and end up holding on for another quarter, or until they hopefully release some ground breaking news.

2021-04-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Why Your Looking at The Wrong Numbers When Referencing S&P500 Yearly Gains. To summarize since most people won't read this whole thing:

**Most investment firms, news and posts are using a number to calculate S&P500 yearly gains that does not accurately represent whether the S&P500 had a good year or not. This number is only useful for headlines and an incredibly minute number of people. It appears great on paper but this number is then re-posted all around the net spreading bad faith statistics.**


#####**The Problem**

Alright now into the explanation. Most blogs/news/posts reference the yearly difference from the first day of the year to the last day of the year and put it in their headlines. For example, here is [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/here-are-the-top-performing-stocks-in-the-sp-500-for-2020.html) and [USAToday](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/12/31/dow-jones-stocks-were-flat-early-trading-after-year-sharp-swings/4099199001/) claiming the gains for the s&p500 in 2020 was 16.23-16.3%. This makes sense at a surface statistic but once you put it into real situations you realize why it's an almost useless figure. The overwhelming majority of investors ARE NOT buying on the first day of the year and cashing out on the last day. This means the figure being tossed around in the headlines is essentially ignoring the other ~252 trading days of that year. 



[Figure 1 & 2](https://imgur.com/a/cNv8OZS) display two theoretical movements in 2020 with the same starting price and ending price. The media would be reporting the same headline figure of 'S&P500 has 16% growth in 2020'. You can see how this headline year to date figure ignores the actual health and movement of the S&P500. Especially if the final few days in 2020 are a spike like [this]( https://imgur.com/a/VyVJ5EX) theoretical graph.



Since the timing of the average person’s trades are nowhere near this, the publicized statistics on whether the S&P500 had a good year or not does not actually reflect if it had a good year or not. If you held the S&P500 for exactly a year but the sell date was any different your gains are going to be completely different. 



#####**Exploring More**



The one thing all these news organizations highlight is the concept of a year gap between the end date and starting date (253 trading days is what I'm considering a year). This is a really ignored concept that should be explored more. If you have the end date on any other day in 2020 and minus 253 trading days, you are probably going to see a large difference. Let’s look at four examples in [this graph.]( https://imgur.com/a/y2UevmW)


•	Holding from Jan 3, 2019 - Jan 6, 2020 (253 Trading Day Difference) = +32.53% 

•	Mar 21, 2019 – Mar 23, 2020 = -21.7%

•	Oct 30, 2019 – Oct 30, 2020 = +7.37%

•	Dec 4, 2019 – Dec 4, 2020 = +18.75%



Since the common denominator is this exact yearlong hold we should be extending this to calculate averages for the entire year as a whole instead of one single instance out of ~253 possible instances.


#####**The Solution**


So [figure 4]( https://imgur.com/a/y2UevmW) demonstrates 4 examples of holding for exactly a year and selling in 2020. To calculate an average, you need to find all ~253 examples. If you do this, you get a calculation which is best represented by the phrase ‘Average S&P500 Returns In 2020 After Holding For A Year’. It’s a mouthful but a much more accurate representation to the health and movement of the S&P500 on a comparison to a year ago (another phrase is ""Average S&P500 Yearly Gains in 2020""). 



[Here](https://imgur.com/a/uPlsMdu) is a distribution of all of those 253 examples. I’ve taken the liberty to skim off the bottom (lowest) 12 instances and top (highest) 12 instances (roughly 9.5%) to get rid of any massive single day outliers. This doesn’t affect the calculations that much but paints a more accurate picture. The average for 2020 is +10.97% (without the skim it’s 10.58%). You can see in Figure 5 that there is a lot of instances in the 14.6%-16.6% range but in total 71.6% of instances have an increase less than 16.2%. **That’s quite a large chance to be lower than the number being paraded.** I also did the math since 2016.




•	[2016]( https://imgur.com/a/igkjbbb) average of +1.65%

•	[2017]( https://imgur.com/a/1Mt2P4d) average of +16.97%

•	[2018]( https://imgur.com/a/dPSR4j3) average of +12.92%

•	[2019]( https://imgur.com/a/VvVvZbc) average of +5.78%

•	Combining the years [2016-2020]( https://imgur.com/a/HnDCBW3) with a skim of 50 on each end has an average of 9.74%



Let’s compare these to [Yearly S&P500]( https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns) change since 2016


Year | Published Numbers| My Calculations
:-- |:--|:--
2016 | 9.54% | 1.65%
2017 | 19.42% | 16.97%
2018 | -6.24% | 12.92%
2019 | 28.88% | 5.78%
2020 | 16.26% | 10.97%



What I find most interesting is that the published numbers almost always completely miss what’s actually happening in that year (2017 being sort of close). In 2018 if you don’t skim any numbers there is only 8 days out of 251 trading days that had -6.24% or less. **To put that into perspective the entire year is being summarized by something that only happened 3.2% of the time.** Make it make sense.




#####**TL;DR/Summary**


The media and investment firms are using the ‘Year to Date’ to interpret whether the S&P500 had a good year or not. This figure is then spread like wildfire on the internet as the god send statistic. While it is a real statistic it is being used in incredibly bad faith and does not actually represent whether the S&P500 had a good year or not. For example [this]( https://imgur.com/a/cNv8OZS) displays two theoretical movements in 2020 with the same starting price and ending price. Both would be paraded as being good years because of the 16% increase. This one instance of a yearlong gap makes up just 1 out of ~253 instances of the year. To calculate a more accurate statistic you need to average every year long gap for all trading days that year. In 2020 this equals 10.97% not the paraded 16.26%. The most notable difference is the published S&P500 YTD 2018 example above.

**Disclaimers**

Full disclosure I chose WallStreetJournals S&P500 Index Close data seen [Here]( https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/index/SPX/historical-prices). One could take the opening price instead, but I chose the closing price. An extremely important concept is holding for exactly 253 trading days, that's what my math takes into account. Not a single day more or less. So if you hold for 255 days the percentages will be different. This concept can of course be applied to any stock/etf, I only focused this post on the S&P500 so that majority of people are familiar with it."

2021-04-26 23:36:34,stocks,"I'm less optimistic here, as somebody who works in telecoms. The UK is a very competitive telco market and BT has done a poor job transitioning from its PBX (phone systems) and WLR (wholesale line rental) business and is bleeding market share as it moves into higher margin and integrated service offerings, ""UCaaS"" or Unified Communications as a Service. Yeah, it still throws off some profit, but with a regulator constantly pruning, competitors constantly sniping and a lot of historical issues to work through, there are better companies.

&#x200B;

Also, everybody always gets so excited about telco networks, coverage and xG, for example, but that shit is for B2B and sales/marketing people. Once you get usage to connect, the customer doesn't care. That's when the ""BSS"" (Business Support Systems) instead of the ""OSS"" (Operational Support Systems) comes to the fore. That's really about how you get value off the network, and here BT is poor. From RoI to PTCs (Propensity to \[credit\]/\[churn\]/\[call\]/\[complain\]), the numbers aren't great, and that's where you can even get hold of the numbers. Once did a project with BT and learned that they don't have the reporting infrastructure to accurately record churn... yikes!

&#x200B;

If you wanted a quality UK telecoms company, I'd opt for Gamma Communications. It's expensive, but for a reason, it's a great company, and their internal processes and people are both extremely good and slick. I have worked with, but never for, both companies on both commercial and technical levels, and the difference is stark.

&#x200B;

In general, the FTSE is significantly ""cheap"" compared to the US market(s), but I think BT is a poor choice. It feels about fairly valued at present. The run up has been caused by a bit of a dead cat bounce and yea, things maybe not being as bad as consensus expected. Also, something you missed is that the tax announcements in terms of investment in the latest Budget were very favourable to BT, as the expectation is that companies will use that as a chance to upgrade any legacy architecture. However, although BT as a brand still carries some safety / comfort here, there is just too much history to indicate that BT won't be the winner the market hopes it will be from any upgrades. When it deals with small customers, competitors are either slicker offering a ""cookie cutter"" model with some generous hardware bolt-on, and larger customers have their own IT department for safety and expect more of a service wrap and Sales Relationship Manager with MIS than BT can offer."

2021-04-26 23:08:39,stocks,"Most of the answers below have no idea what they are talking about. Many are too vested emotionally and dont understand business and there are those who understand business but nothing about the industry and still others who understand industry but nothing about valuation.

Here is my analysis:

1. They have about 1100 workers now
   1. Witcher 3 only had 250
   2. CP2077 had 400 by release
   3. Supposedly about 50 work on app stuff and another 100 on online games
   4. .. do the math... A lot of missing workers who havent been seen in a long time. Where are they?
2. The last presentation stated clearly that they will be working on 2 AAA games in parallel by 2022 and they wanted to push more into mobile and side stuff thought they didnt elaborate on this.
   1. Odds are they already are working on the next AAA if you are following the logic from #1 above.
3. CP2077 sold 14m copies by end of last year... this is far from failure. In fact it was extremely profitable and they had their best year in company history.
   1. If only did poorly on consoles but most of those sales so far were on PC where the game was playable from day 1 and was no more or less buggy than any other big open world game.
4. Their current PE is about 16... granted its very cyclical due to release times but even so, that is extremely low.
5. Witcher as a franchise alone, is probably worth more than $4b by itself.
   1. What is the brand worth? Even if its nothing lets look at sales...
   2. It has enormous sales. Witcher 3, alone, sold 30m copies. Lets say average $15 net each overall gives us a net profit of $450m.
      1. Total rev is probably north of $2b.
      2. This is just Witcher 3... what about the other related games?
   3. The only issue with net/revenue is timing. If its once per 5 years, its not so great but thats simply a function of the company who owns it, not of the franchise itself. At a bigger company, there is no reason why they cant leverage scale to do a yearly release of some sort, be it offshoots or major expansions.
      1. Clearly, CDR has already realized this hence the huge employment push.
6. Their profit margins are higher than most other companies due to their own publishing platform at GOG. So there is a good chance the average net is higher than I listed.
   1. GOG is the #2 publisher outside of consoles. That has to be worth something to someone. Even though it doesnt generate much yet, it has a strong reputation and is generally preferred over all the competitors not named Steam. That has to be worth north of $2b if not more for the customer attraction alone.
      1. Growth here should be good going forward because it doesnt depend on them specifically.
      2. They seem to be pushing to innovate the platform. Its needed but it also means that there might be a lot more profit to be made here.
   2. Sales have been trending to digital sales. Digital sales are more profitable so future releases are likely to have better margins.
7. Reputation will not be hurt by CP2077. Think about it. Will people not buy Elder Scrolls because the last 2 Fallouts sucked? No... not just no, more like not a chance. I cant wait for it myself. Just how many open world RPG's are there really? Not enough. And mind you, FO76 was far worse than CP2077 at release.
   1. They also handled the problem like professionals.

So in summary, Witcher + GOG alone are probably worth north of $6b... the company right now is valued below $5b... lol. This, right now, is the gem of the gaming industry. I guarantee you that every gaming company is eyeing it for buyout but CDR has stated in the past that its not interested. That was a long time ago so I dont know the current status.

Also my $6b valuation assumes Cyberpunk is worth $0... 14m copies sold mostly on PC is no joke. Release cycles are also about to get cut in half. See point 1 and 2 above.

Good odds we will see a AAA release next year or early 2023. I would be surprised otherwise because, again, about 500 employees are MIA right now and have been for about 2 years.... what are they doing? Other rev streams will include CP2077 on consoles bringing in some extra cash, DLC after that, and some other smaller projects and of course, whatever they make at GOG which is profitable right now though not a big cash maker yet."
2021-04-26 20:19:40,stocks,"Go to steam charts and see how many players are playing cyberpunk and Witcher 3.

Cyberpunk lost all it hype. In twitch no one is watching as well. CDR may have a short term pump when sony lets them sell their game again. But that will only happen when they finally fix their game."

This has been a major complaint of the US and EU regarding China's policies on foreign investment.

Additionally, I think you're taking his phrasing out of context:

    MR. COOPER: What about the Uyghurs? What about the human rights abuses in China?

    THE PRESIDENT: We must speak up for human rights. It’s who we are. We can’t — my comment to him was — and I know him well, and he knows me well. We’re — a two-hour conversation.

    MR. COOPER: You talked about this to him?

    THE PRESIDENT: I talked about this, too. And that’s not so much refugee, but I talked about — I said — look, you know, Chinese leaders — if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been — the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven’t been unified at home. So the central — to vastly overstate it — the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.

    I point out to him: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesn’t reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea I’m not going to speak out against what he’s doing in Hong Kong, what he’s doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the One China policy by making it forceful — I said — and by the — he said he — he gets it. Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they — their leaders — are expected to follow.

    MR. COOPER: When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just — is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.? Or is there any actual repercussions for China?

    THE PRESIDENT: Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that. What I’m doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other — other agencies that have an impact on their attitude."

This kind of policy is determined in the State Department, which has moved to viewing China as a strategic competitor (as did the intelligence agencies and the defense department). This wasn't just about Trump, such concerns were already increasing during the Obama administration.

The EU, UK, Canada and Australia have similar views, so this is fast becoming a common understanding of ""the West"" as a whole. That's why the EU, UK and Canada joined the US on the Uighur issue (and Australia would do so as well but they hesitate given the threat of trade reprisals from China).

What has been driving this are the increasingly maximalist ambitions of China and its gradual rapprochement with Russia; more recently the ""[wolf warrior diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_warrior_diplomacy)"" and China's moves on Hong Kong have convinced even the skeptics that some sort of strategic contest with China is unavoidable."

The market thrives on people who operate with on a gut feeling. I’m a fan of what you’re suggesting when the signs are clear enough. For example I was In a stock that went from  40 to 34, and then bounced around there for about a month. A classic flag and pennant. When that stock broke down to 32, I sold. When it went to 28 and rebounded, I bought again. I missed out on the potential 40 to 28 because I wasn’t sure what was going to happen. I held through what I felt was uncertain losses  and sold when the i thought the writing was on the wall. That’s not so much discipline as it is planning. How much are you willing to plan and bet on those plans? Up to you, really."
2021-04-26 23:35:39,stocks,Yes if you’re confident in the stocks movements it’s a solid strategy to reduce your basis. I did it earlier today with some UNFI stock. Sold at 36 on Friday and got back in around 34.5 today
2021-04-26 23:53:31,stocks,No because it will be a wash sale

2021-04-27 03:55:15,stocks,"AT 100 you have 1 share 

If you sell at 90 you now have 90 dollars 

If you buy at 80 now with 90 you have 1.125 shares. For you to make a profit the price has to go up 11% or to 88 and above."
2021-04-27 05:58:14,stocks,"Since no one seems to be answering the actual question, yes. If a stock is at $90 and you are confident it will drop to $80 before rebounding then you should likely sell and buy back in. 

I’m not trying to be insulting, but if you are asking that question you shouldn’t be attempting that strategy however since you don’t have the skills to know that it’s going to drop to $80 and then recover."

2021-04-26 21:43:25,stocks,"It's not that it's wrong, it's that it leads to bad decision making.  It's a pet peeve of mine.  There's no reason you should average your purchase prices together. It doesn't yield a useful number.  There is no scenario where you derive extra benefit from buying shares of something you've lost money on.

The reason people do it is because it looks better on their broker's P&L screen.  All you're really doing is surrounding the tainted shares with new shares that look better, who just so happen to have the matching ticker symbol. It doesn't actually change your account balance at all. It doesn't actually create value or lead to greater profits.  Your return to profitability is solely on the backs of those new shares, which you're depending on going up in price. But there's no reason to expect they would, any more than the shares you already have.  Sure, you still lost money on that original purchase, but \*on average\* you're profitable!

Likewise, all I'm really doing is surrounding my short stature with other people that look taller, who just so happen to have the matching team uniform. It doesn't actually change my height at all. It doesn't actually create inches or lead to greater dunking ability.  My team's height is solely on the backs of those new player, whom I'm depending on to boost our measurements. But there's no reason to expect I'd get any taller, any more than I already am. Sure, I'm still as short as I ever was, but \*on average\* we're tall!

&#x200B;

This is more than a pedantic nitpick.  For some reason, psychologically, people [would rather make $1 on MSFT and $1 on TSLA than make $3 on MSFT and lose $1 on TSLA](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/loss-aversion/).  The sum is higher, and they're richer with the latter, but they \*hate\* taking losses, so they'd rather be poorer than wrong. And that leads to bad investing or trading decisions.  Consider the following:

Alice: Buy 2 NFLX at 550. It falls to 500. Buy 6 NFLX at 500.  NFLX rises to 530.

Bob: Buy 2 NFLX at 550. It falls to 500. Buy 6 TSLA at 500.  NFLX and TSLA rise to 530.

Who makes more money?  The only correct answer is neither; they're exactly the same.  The ticker doesn't matter. The amounts of shares and the prices are all that matter.  Yet for some reason, you'll see people say ""NFLX is down, therefore I should buy more and reduce my cost basis"" even though they could buy literally *anything else* and just as equally reduce their portfolio's cost basis. They'll sum the two NFLX transactions in their head, but for some reason, they refuse to sum two different stocks in the same manner, even though the ticker makes no difference at all to their wealth."
2021-04-26 20:00:15,stocks,"Most of the time, a stock can only go to zero, so lose 100% of value. But it could easily gain more than 100% of value... so when you are speculating especially, the downside is not significant compared to the upside.  And if it doesn't work out, well, you can always realize that loss to offset gains elsewhere in your portfolio for tax purposes."

2021-04-26 23:36:32,stocks,"I’m only in total market funds, 100%.

When I hit 45 years old, I’ll probably shift to 90% stocks and 10% bond funds, and rebalance another 10% every 5 years.

* 45 = 90% stock
* 50 = 80% stock
* 55 = 70%
* 60 = 60%
* 65 = 50%
* 70 = 40%

This may not be optimal, but I still have a number of years to go before even hitting 40, I’ll probably start researching rebalancing into old age then.  But for now we’re 100% stock.

Maybe I stop at 50:50 to keep stock exposure pumping for whatever family I may have.  The idea is not to “cash out” and throw a big party where I buy a Lamborghini.  Ideally I’m retired by 50-60 and draw on it to live while also leaving a chunk behind for family...although I only just got married and only have 3 cats.  So if no kids I guess it goes to extended family or a charity.

The main idea is lower retirement age.  The dream is retire before 50, but my estimates would require me to have $3+ million.  Depending on kids, health, extended family, hobbies, inflation, desire to travel, etc. all impact that number.  It’s a moving target."

You buy for 100, sell for 90, buy for 80, sell for 70.  The 90->80 is a wash sale, so the 10 loss gets added to your purchase price, so you your cost basis is 90. You sell for 70, so obviously your proceeds are 70.  90-70 = 20."
2021-04-26 21:28:33,stocks,"Yes you’re right, I misread and thought they profiting... not double loss"
2021-04-26 21:50:15,stocks,"OK, but...still, with a profit, it's the same thing.

You buy for 100, you sell for 90, you buy for 80...wash sale!...you sell for 90.

The first pair loses $10, the second gains $10, so in a fair world, you owe nothing.  But with the wash sale, you lose $10 and can't write it off as a loss, but in the second pair, you buy for 80 and get a cost basis of 90 due to the wash sale rule.  You sell for 90, so tax-wise you...make no profit.  You get no write off for the $10 loss but pay no tax on the $10 gain.  You again owe nothing.

Say you buy for 100, you sell for 90, you buy for 80...wash sale!...you sell for 150.  That's $10 loss and $70 gain for a net gain of $60.  You pay tax on $60/share.  But because it's a wash sale, you actually pay on..:pulls out calculator:...a $0 loss because you can't write it off and a $60 due to the wash sale's stepped-up basis.  So you pay tax on...$60/share.

It's the same, loss, gain, or breaking even.  The wash sale doesn't rob you of your loss write-off. It only delays it until the final time you sell.  It gets deferred, not deleted."
2021-04-27 11:07:21,stocks,"Yea I meant with booking profit for a current year. So all of losses get deferred to the next tax year because they’re washed and added to the cost basis as you mentioned, but the profit is booked intra year... it’s how you can end with massive tax obligations with little profit"

Not only does MOGO have a lot more room to grow, they have hit all their fundamental landmarks along the way for the last three quarters. Management's projections have been ideal - very accurate, but 1 to 1.5% below actual reported results. They're looking to cross over into being permanently profitable later this year, which should provide a substantive and permanent boost to its valuations. 

The market has been all over the place about how to value the company. (At its recent peak, its P/S ratio was on par w/ SQ, which is objectively out of touch.) However, while it was still in the $4 range, I had $7-$8/share as a reasonable 2021 year-end expectation, with 10-11 a realistic bull case. That is the trajectory that leads me to minimum 40, max 65 (or even higher) in 3-5 years.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you buy in with anything more than a passively speculative gamble play, do some DD to learn what you expect to see in terms of user base growth and top line revenue performance along the way. As long as they keep hitting or exceeding those marks (as they have been the last several quarters) ignore the price action. Stock price has pulled back recently. When I check my portfolio and I see deep red, the first thing I check is MOGO. If I'm red because of MOGO, I don't care. I only get concerned if MOGO is doing fine and I'm red because of the other 85% of my portfolio."

But to answer your questions, I have struggled with this myself and the main issue is with lump sum investing. Psychology makes it painful to invest all at once and see the value go down significantly. Or if you sell a large position and see the price move up significantly. 

So the trick is to not do any lump sum investing or make any big moves. Dollar cost average your buys and trim and make small sells periodically. If a stock sees a large gain sell half a percent to raise some cash. 

Cash is itself a position. It's an option. An option to buy. It depreciates like other options but at a much slower rate (due to inflation). 

If you see a large 20% jump in one or 3 days consider trimming 1-3%. Now you have the cash to look elsewhere. 

But never sell the entire position. View those tiny sells as dividends. Not as liquidations.

And keep DCA into it if you love the stock."
2021-04-27 00:00:58,stocks,"Do you really think it will increase further in the short term?  What's stopping you securing partial profit?

Lots of people choose to enter a position by buying over time.  IF you have the time to watch it, you can enter cheaper than a lump sum, unless it's running up and you are chasing it (bad idea most of the time).

If you are confident in the company, you can then continue the same process and add more shares over time when you think there's a pricing advantage.

Some people lament that if you take profit early, you will forgo potential earnings.  If you are very confident in the company, meaning you are watching all their filings of financial records etc, then you could forgo taking early profit and let it all ride longer.

You cannot time the market so when to cash out really is up to when you think you've made or lost enough.  This will take self-discipline.

2021-04-27 00:32:50,stocks,"The assumption in your argument is that *I would know*, before I decide to build a position in a company I like, that its stock would fall further. If I do know that, I would not have built a position at all but wait until the price drops further. The truth is that nobody knows what will happen to a stock price in the short term. However, if the stock is truly undervalued, every passing day give the market a chance to correct its mistake and increase the stock's price, and there goes my gain.

Sure, any point that a stock is still undervalued, you can still buy, regardless of whether the price drops or rise, *if you are comfortable with adding more of the company, as opposed to buying other companies that you have also done DD on*.

2021-04-27 00:55:09,stocks,"Yes, comparison to similar companies in the same industry is an important component in your DD. Remember that there is usually a reason for a company to have a lower PE ratio compared to its competitor (bad management, lots of debt, downward trend in revenue, etc.) Take the case study of Intel compared to its competitors AMD and others, INTC has an extremely low PE (12) compared to AMD (88). Now, there are a lot of reasons/DD given by analyst, pundits, investors for why INTC merit such a low DD. Some of the factors mentioned such as bad management cannot be quantified. Your job is to determine if those reasons/DD has merit or an overreaction. If those analysts are right, maybe INTC is correctly valued even at such low PE, and vice versa. 

But yes, your starting point should be comparing basic metrics such as PE ratio between companies from the same industry. Then, start on doing more DD if you find any of them worth your effort. Take the example above: INTC is definitely a contender for an undervalued company, but you need to do more research on it. Basic metric is your starting point, but should never be your ending point."

> The stock market isn't just the same pool of money rotating around

Correct. But the economy *is* the same pool of money. When one person moves from cash into stock, the only way they can do it is by persuading someone else to move from stock into cash. To buy requires a seller.

There is no such thing as 'people being bullish' or 'people being bearish'.

Bullishness and bearishness **in aggregate** exists entirely in your own mind! 

Everyone time 1 share is bought, 1 share is sold.

Every time $1 is spent, $1 is received.

There is no such thing as 'accumulating cash' or 'accumulating stocks' when we talk about 'people' (in the context of 'the market') rather than 'a person'.

OK, let me explain it in simple terms. 

- There is a shop. 

- A man walks up to the shop and exchanges $1 for a mars bar. 

- Alternatively, we can say the shopkeeper exchanges the mars bar for $1.

- Someone comments: THIS IS BULLISH FOR MARS BARS! THAT GUY BOUGHT A MARS BAR!

- Someone else comments: THIS IS BEARISH FOR MARS BARS! THAT OTHER GUY SOLD A MARS BAR!

The thing that is missing from your brain is the realisation that *we live in the shop all the time* and the number of mars bars and $ remains constant regardless of which people own them. You seem to think some people (group A) are 'important' and their buying matters and must be counted, whereas the other people who are the sellers (group B), the ones who supply group A with things that they are buying - you think group B's selling somehow does not matter and should not be counted.

2021-04-26 22:49:11,stocks,"What do y’all consider the “first dip?” I’m fairly new to buying/trading and was going to buy UiPath but gut told me to hold off. 

I’m in the rpa industry and work quite a bit with UiPath selling and implementing their product suite."
2021-04-27 12:34:05,stocks,AGTC just had their Chief Scientific Officer depart...stock is down about 9% as of writing this. Was thinking about taking a position with the price under $4.
2021-04-27 14:16:07,stocks,Increasing my position
2021-04-27 14:38:56,stocks,👍
2021-04-27 14:35:09,stocks,"This was a great DD and gave me a lot of food for thought I have been contemplating jumping in but what is worrying me is all the insider selling activity. [http://openinsider.com/search?q=rfp](http://openinsider.com/search?q=rfp)

Have you seen this? Is this not a concern?"
2021-04-27 15:18:30,stocks,"Yea i saw that. All those people sold a small fraction of their total shares after the dip in February. My take was it was reasonable profit taking since the stock jumped 600% in a year. None of them have sold since and since they all still have major holdings, i dont see any major red flags from that angle.

Glad I could help."
2021-04-27 11:19:09,stocks,Breakout has commenced LFG!!!
2021-04-27 11:20:06,stocks,What’s your thoughts on earnings already being priced in once there released?
2021-04-27 13:39:04,stocks,TD securities just upped their PT from 12 to 20$.
2021-04-27 13:40:13,stocks,Q1 earnings are. Q2 and q3 which will be substantially higher than Q1 arent. So i think the next few months will be even better.
2021-04-27 17:42:29,stocks,AGC is definitely a long term hold. Look for a price target of $85-$120 in the next 4 years
2021-04-27 13:33:24,stocks,Good tips and links thank you
2021-04-27 13:31:37,stocks,Woah spy is higher than vanguard i just checked on them from your post😫😫
2021-04-26 20:53:51,stocks,"Look at Apple's buybacks. They're not exactly being discerning on price. Buybacks made at prices above intrinsic value, reduce the value of the company.

Most companies seem to conclude the best investment on the market is their own shares. Clearly, that can't be true for every company."
2021-04-26 20:55:54,stocks,"The concept of lowering supply is hilarious. Lowering supply at a given price, yes."
2021-04-26 20:32:38,stocks,"It’s a good question. I keep some of the premium for other plays, but I reinvest about 80% in more shares of the underlying. Time is your friend and you’ll be surprised what you can do YOY. 

If the shares get called away, I buy back the shares almost immediately unless I expect a better entry point in the near future. 

Keep in mind there are short term gains tax implications associated with this strategy. I like this mostly for my Roth IRA. I can’t use that money for a few decades and the tax advantages are great. Selling covered LEAPS can also be an interesting way to play an IRA."
2021-04-27 11:00:38,stocks,Net takes 50% of my portfolio lol
