2021-04-06,stocks,"Withdrawal rate include dividend? I’m not there yet but what if I have $5 million in investments and had a withdrawal rate of 5% (read somewhere that this is a completely fine rate). Assuming dividend yield in total for my portfolio was 2%, would my withdrawal rate in total be about 7%? After taxes this would equate to $297,500 net income for the year. But I also know that dividends would be taxed differently so would be likely lower net income than what I have shown."
2021-04-06,stocks,"Brokerage to buy all stocks in index? I have always just held a trio of ETFs (VTI, VEA, VWO), but would like to more aggressively manage my capital gains (I donate equities in kind, and want to be able to get rid of the most highly appreciated assets, rather than just the average gains).

I would like to be able to just say ""give me $200k of the companies that underlie the broad US market (or s&p, or whatever)."" Anyone have any opinions on the best way to do this?"
2021-04-06,stocks,Recommendations please I have a been sitting on a large (for me) $70K cask position now for two months. I would appreciate hearing recommendations for putting this money back to work. My primary goal for this would be capital preservation but I’d like to generate a 5-10% return over a 6-12 month timeline. Dividends or covered calls to ensure returns while not worrying about capital preservation is the goal. Recommendations?
2021-04-06,stocks,XLI vs PAVE - Industrial ETFs What are your thoughts on either industrial ETF if you have to pick only one? PAVE has a higher expense ratio but showed better growth compared to XLI. XLI top 10 holdings are also dubiously not very industrial related compared to PAVE (eg. 3 of the 10 are just defence/aerospace companies).

Any information anyone has on this would be greatly appreciated, including both specifically about this instance, or return of capital payments more generally.

2021-04-06,stocks,"Competitors or alternatives to BIP/BIPC I'm long BIP. But I didn't realize how much extra work the k-1 was gonna be during tax season. I'm not long enough to justify the added expense of using a CPA.

So I'm in the market for alternatives. BIP, imo, is too expensive and BIPC trades at an even higher premium. 

The only things I have found so far would be asset management groups but they are more like BAM in that they are less focused on the niche infrastructure and real asset market.

Thanks in advance.

2021-04-06,stocks,"What are your highest conviction picks So it's simple what's your highest conviction stocks


So to start of my highest conviction stocks has to be Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook, Amazon, Google and Unilever
Here's why I like these in short

So I like Berkshire Hathaway because of warren buffet and Charlie munger but also this is a diversified business and it's growing YoY.
Google and Facebook are one of the best in the world the advertising business is growing strong every year and there's no sign this will stop also they are entering other industrys
With Amazon it's another beast who's entering other industries all the time there cloud computing is growing strong and there advertising business are also growing.
With Unilever I like this because over 2 billion people use their products every day and it's growing in emarging markets.


I do have some high conviction funds eswell iam from the UK so most of you guys won't recognise these but you can reasherch them. So to start off my high conviction funds and trusts are Smithson investment trust, fundsmith equity, lindsel train global equity, Finsbury growth and income, Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust.

Here's why I like these funds and why you should reasherch them
So with fundsmith equity it's ran by Terry Smith who's a legendary British Investor from 2003 to now he's averaged around 15% returns and what's even more impressive from 2003 to 2013 in the ""lost decade"" he averaged 14% return every year.
He also gets a say in the Smithson investment trust but he doesn't run it everyday and Terry also gets compared to warren buffet.
With the lindsell train global equity and Finsbury growth and income they are both ran buy another legendary investor named nick train. He is a expert in the UK markets both his funds are diversified with exposure to Japan UK and USA.
Finally to Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust. So these trust are similar to arkk funds and their parent company who controls the fund baillie Gifford were also at one point before the pandemic the second largest shareholder of Tesla just behind Elon musk they have sold some of Their stake after the impressive run up. The main reason I hold these trusts is because of the private company exposure

Some honourable mentions are visa Mastercard and Adobe and Microsoft. I like them but won't buy them because of their valuations

So what are your highest conviction stocks and why ?"

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Are they just calculating the PEG ratio for 2025 using hypothetical numbers and comparing that to current stock price? What about EBITDA 5 years out vs. current stock price how are the figuring out future EBITDA? Based on historical data?

I scoured Google every which way and sideways and there isn’t a website that explains this or I just didn’t type in my question correctly. Can some one smarter than me explain like I’m 10 on how these two things are calculated?

We have had several technological revolutions in the past and I’m not sure the economy has changed in the way that would support her argument here. While I like the idea of Ark funds, I’m just skeptical of their performance moving forward. Just because these sectors may be more popular in the future, it doesn’t mean they will be super profitable and it certainly doesn’t mean Ark will beat the market!

2021-04-06,stocks,"Why do limit orders react instantly to market orders, and how could this cause a momentary increase of nearly 10% on both sides? I'm not allowed to mention the specific underlying here, but I think it doesn't really matter what the underlying is as it seems every market is vulnerable to this kind of thing. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I figured many of you would know the answer to this question. There are two main parts:

&#x200B;

1) As I understand it the basic principle is to execute market orders which will change the price in your favor. This is would be extremely simple, but there is a level of complexity to how this is achieved. I tested this and found that multiple consecutive orders with the same price action need to be registered in order for any useful effect to happen. The best way to describe it is that these consecutive orders accelerate the direction of the price. It would be odd to have this just be a feature of markets, but I can only assume it's other investors creating this effect. Who is sitting there waiting for price action to make a limit order? Is that not literally what market orders are for? Also, why in the world would two market orders in a row make anyone more eager? I am completely confused how this works...

&#x200B;

2)Today I watched what appeared to be the accelerating effect I mentioned above. Both the ask and the bid sides were given forward momentum through market orders. I have never seen anything like this before, but I believe it had something to do with a limit order being spent. The underlying fucking leapt. I felt like I was in a whirlpool. You literally couldn't read any of the limit orders unless you were just focusing on the center. Even then it was anyone's guess what the next one up would be, so.... is this people being speculative, or is this abuse of a fundamental part of the market?"

When I called the broker, they put in a market sell order and told me my confirmation would be sent to my email later. 

They sold my shares for $62.58/share

Brk.b traded today at $260-263.35

Does anyone know how this is even possible? I understand market orders won’t exercise at the exact price, but a 76% loss, is absolutely crazy. 

Is there no sort of protection against this kind of thing? How does this even happen? 

The broker is closed now for the evening, but will be calling first thing in the morning. 

Looking for some helpful information or thing I can reference when I call in the morning at open.






EDIT UPDATE:

Called them this morning. They didn’t even answer the phone during their posted business hours. Just adds the the amazing service this company provides. 

After calling the number for the old platform holders, and nearly 25mins on hold, they found a person for me to speak with.

I described the problem and the representative n the phone seemed like this was normal at first. She then had a light bulb go off and remembered they had an internal email she quickly glossed over that discussed this issue. She asked me to hold so she could review it again. 

Apparently there was an error on the new platform that didn’t perform the sell orders correctly. They were suppose to sell at $262.276.

I asked when, if, they would be correcting this and if they planned to notify the customers. They said that they were in the process of correcting the error but never notified the customers of the issue(wonderful, thanks). 

I guess it also takes 10 days after the sell date, to receive my money. Also, she confirmed they still don’t sell fractional shares. 

I plan to no longer use them, but leave the remaining 1.5 shares or so that’s left in there, forever.


2nd update: people wanted to know the firm/broker.
It’s Global Shares Equity


I DO NOT recommend them.

Usually with a company you already believe is undervalued and/or has high growth opportunities and have positions in.. just a quick in and out play but keeping initial positions invested.

Telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) can be an income machine for stimulus check recipients at $30 per share

For example, the rollout of 5G networks should be a significant positive for AT&T. It's been a decade since the last upgrade of wireless download speeds, which suggests that consumers and businesses will be jumping at the prospect of updating their wireless devices. Since AT&T generates its juiciest margins from wireless data, an increase in download speeds can only improve its operating margins.


AT&T also stands to benefit from its push into streaming. Despite a slow start to the launch of HBO Max in late May, AT&T's subscriber numbers have picked up significantly in recent months. This may have to do with subsidiary WarnerMedia releasing all of its movies in 2021 on HBO Max the same day they'll hit theaters."

Say I think the market is going to drop over the next 4 months. How would you gamble your money to best profit from that? Is there a specific company you would short because they stand to drop the most and the premium on the short is the lowest?

Any advice is really appreciated.

EDIT: A big thank you to this community for taking the time to educate me. I think by putting crash in the title, I triggered a lot of people. Saying ""short"" instead of ""puts"" also seemed to trigger a lot of people. 

I am sorry to waste your time, I think if I wrote it like this it would have gone over better.

""**Just theoretically**, if you were a long term bull investor, but one day you thought there was going to be an event that would cause the market to pull back 20%, and you thought it might happen in the next 5 months. How would you invest that money, so you are risking the least, but stand to make the most from it?""

The conclusion from the comments, suggest puts on inverse ETFs, but because the period of time is 5 months, then just buy the inverse ETF. But in the end you are stupid for even considering this.

There is NTOA in frankfurt (61 EUR last price) and NTO in Frankfurt (487.00 EUR last price) which don't seem to have too much volume, the prices seem to be in 0.5 EUR increments and I'm also not sure why there are two of them (I guess there are two different stock classes?) and I can access them via degiro.

For a little background - I'm '18' years old, and since October, I've made a large effort to learn more about the stock market and investing in general. I would like to say that I am knowledgeable in the subject. I've learned and traded everything from fractional shares to butterfly spreads.

But as I think more and more about long term financial decisions, I've certainly noticed that I'm transitioning out of high-risk positions and more into growth stocks + tech ETFs. When I secure a stable job, my plan is to put half of it in an ETF, and keep the other half on standby to hedge against a potential upcoming market crash. 

And that got me thinking... Why am I so sure of an upcoming market crash? And not just that -- why am I sure it'll happen so soon? Surely, if a market crash happened, chances are it wouldn't dip down to it's 20 year lows when I bought it...

2021-04-06,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 5, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 5, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Monday, continuing their strong performance from last Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recording fresh highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Biden’s recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

President Biden’s plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nation’s transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html). 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said, “ ""While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be “transitory,” yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative."" 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Gamestop (GME) sank after the company announced it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares. 
* Shares of Tesla gapped up more than 4% after the company reported better than expected March delivery numbers. Other EV companies also posted better-than-expected deliveries but didn’t rise nearly as much.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) -     U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, as a round of strong  economic data on the labor market and services sector buoyed investor  optimism for the economic reopening and a muted climb in the 10-year  U.S. Treasury yield kept inflation worries at bay.

An ISM survey for March showed a measure of U.S. services industry  activity jumped to a record high. The data followed Friday's report  showing U.S. nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs in March, trouncing  forecasts.  

Investors have bet on sectors poised to lead an economic reopening,  such as energy, financials and materials. A climbing yield on the  10-year U.S. Treasury note has dented appetite for technology stocks. 

Despite strong economic data, gains were led by sectors that have  underperformed recently, including communication services, consumer  discretionary and tech, as the 10-year yield remained below a 14-month  high hit last week.  

""One of the fears in March was that the rise in rates meant you need to take multiples down,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. 

""It's not the reopening trade at this point, it is higher interest  rates are here but not accelerating so the whole economy is being  lifted."" 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 385.96 points, or 1.16%, to  33,539.17, the S&P 500 gained 59.11 points, or 1.47%, to 4,078.98  and the Nasdaq Composite added 234.78 points, or 1.74%, to 13,714.89.

With speedy vaccinations and additional government stimulus helping  the S&P 500 and the Dow clinch all-time highs, focus now turns to  progress on a massive infrastructure plan and the upcoming corporate  earnings season.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still about 4% below its February high as  the recent spike in bond yields spurred inflation concerns and made  growth stocks less attractive.

Energy shares were the worst performing sector, following a sharp  drop in oil prices. Reopening plays gained, as the S&P 1500 airlines  index jumped 3.43% after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said fully vaccinated people can safely travel at ""low risk."" The  agency had held off for weeks on revising guidance that discouraged all  non-essential trips.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she was  working with G20 countries to agree on a global corporate minimum tax  rate to end a ""30-year race to the bottom on corporate tax rates."""
2021-04-06,stocks,"Resources to learn about ad tech business I was looking to buy pubmatic when it IPO'ed in december. I didn't and it's stock doubled. I am not regretting because I didn't fully understand the business at that time. It would have been a purchase without DD and I would have easily lost money too.

I am seeing lot of ad tech stocks doing well. Can some one point me to resources to systematically understand this business? I see google analytics, segment, mix panel etc. The n I see Trade Desk, PubMatic. I am curious how they all play together and which company does what. Also I read somewhere that ROKU is building an advertising moat. I am confused on how all of these work."
2021-04-06,stocks,Stock vs leap option I’m bullish on Apple for the next few years. I was looking to buy a 130 strike leap for Jan 2023. It costs about $1900. At the moment that’s about how much I have in Apple shares. Would it be unwise to sell the shares to buy the leap? At the moment selling the apple shares would be the only way I can afford the option.
2021-04-06,stocks,Anyone holding Petco (WOOF)? It’s being shorted over %26 for some reason. I like the potential. Petco has recently implemented some changes to their business model and just recently cut out raw hides from their stores. I like where they are going with the company. It’s trading very low at the moment and with their online business really picking up momentum I think Petco is going places in the foreseen future.

I was doing some research to jump into the Biotech sector and noticed this seems like a good time to get in such low cost. However, I am nervous since it IPO was at like $500.

I’ve tried to do some research and haven’t been able to come up with too much to help my decision to get in or not.

Any positive feedback, DD, insight to share 
-why you’re in and like it 
-or why you don’t like it 
-and why the F did the drop like 90% since IPO


Thanks 🙏"

Long story short a friend with me in the car lightly hit a pole. Small damages. Took it to a body shop and the body shop said she had no steering wheel air bag. They guessed the recalled air bags were renovated but never replaced and sold from a dealership as such. 
Hyundai is speculated to swap her car for a brand new one. 
This may be hearsay but it’s from a friend who is at a body shop now and I was there during the fender bender. so take it as lightly as you see fit."

By Tsvetana Paraskova - Apr 05, 2021, 12:00 PM CDT

The United States has made the first step toward harnessing the potential of wave energy, a powerful source of renewable energy which researchers have been studying for decades.   
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued last month a license for what would be the first commercial-scale, utility grid-connected wave energy test site in the United States.
Oregon State University received that license to build and operate the PacWave South testing facility as the industry is developing technology and devices potentially capable of harnessing the power of ocean waves.
Despite decades of studies, wave energy is still little developed—both in the U.S. and elsewhere—because researchers are still looking at ways to reconcile feasibility and costs in a complex marine environment.
In theory, the potential is enormous. In practice, wave energy will need a lot more testing and technology development if it hopes to become a viable renewable energy source.
Nevertheless, a testing facility operational by the middle of this decade could give the impetus the U.S. industry needs to test various technologies for generating electricity from waves and attract investors in the most promising technology. The Biden Administration’s support of renewable energy could also help with industry innovation.
The U.S. is one of the best places in the world for ocean wave energy generation, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Ocean waves have tremendous energy, and the theoretical annual energy potential of waves off the coasts of the United States is estimated to be as much as 2.64 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh). This equals around 64 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2019, the EIA says.Related: U.S. Oil Production Is About To Climb
The potential is there, and it is tremendous. Still, the industry now needs to test and possibly show that wave energy can make a difference with viable solutions in the drive for boosting renewable energy generation.
Oregon State University’s project leaders hope to obtain from FERC construction authorization for the PacWave South testing facility later this spring. Current timelines suggest that construction could begin this summer, and the facility could be operational by 2023, OSU says.
“We know there is still work to do to make this project a reality, but this is a huge moment for this project and for the industry as a whole,” Burke Hales, chief scientist for PacWave, said in a statement.
The World Energy Council estimates that 10 percent of the worldwide electricity demand could be met by harvesting ocean energy, OSU said.
The PacWave test facility could be the companies’ place to showcase technology in order to attract investors in their proposed developments, according to Hales.
“Even somebody like Bill Gates isn’t going to pay somebody millions of dollars to do tests that they think will fail,” Hales told Grist’s Ysabelle Kempe.
Innovation and testing of devices could unlock the tremendous energy potential of ocean waves, which is highest along the Pacific shorelines: California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, according to a recent study of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory funded by the Department of Energy. The study focuses on the technical resource—the proportion of the theoretical resource that can be captured using existing technology options.
The study found that utilizing just one-tenth of the technically available marine energy resources in the 50 states would equate to 5.7 percent of the current U.S. electricity generation, or enough energy to power 22 million homes. 
DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has identified “energy hotspots” of wave power along the Washington, Oregon, and California coasts.
“Wave power is a significant, sizeable resource,” marine coastal science advisor Simon Geerlofs says. Yet, he noted that wave energy still has challenges to overcome, including big hurdles like ensuring durability and efficiency of wave energy converters and cost-competitiveness with other energy resources. "
