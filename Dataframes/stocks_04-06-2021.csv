2021-04-06 19:52:20,stocks,"Funny comparison.  I was about your age in 2007, with around $30k and also green to investing.  Lost 50% in 2008, but put more in 2009.  That grew to over $100k over the next decade.  

Now, I bought my first home and kept the investments separate (did not sell).

I had some winners like bank stocks bought in March 2009 and some losers.  I thought Blockbuster would beat out Netflix.  

Generally, there is no right answer and you should learn your own lessons.  If you want to keep it simple, you should read “How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street”.  The message is simple, low cost indexing over time.  Otherwise, educate yourself, dabble, make mistakes and learn.  You have the benefit of time on your side, start now."

2021-04-06 19:01:56,stocks,You are missing additional fees. If it is foreign OTC on TDA you get 15$ foreign and $7 OTC fee stacked for $22. Fidelity is still $50 which blows. Not sure on SCHWAB but a lot of people use them for OTCs webull also claims to have nearly no fees they may be cheaper. If you are putting a large sum of cash in you can make $22 back easily though if it is seriously a good play.

I've bought 100 shares @ .85 and 100 at @ 1.10, made my money back already with a little more on top. Psyched to be holding but I'd love to dip trade if I could get around the fees.

2) take a look at premaket. Any major swings any direction? Is there an overall trend? Is is sideways? This can be indicative of the day ahead. 

3) is Jpow, Yellen, or Biden speaking today? If so, what time? Exit your positions before then (can play with house money here, but it’s entirely a gamble). 

4) watch the first minute of price action. Buy a single call or put near a resistance level. Only buy 1. 

5) wait a few minutes. 

6) if your option is descreasing in value, dollar cost average down with another purchase of the same option at a cheaper price. 

7) still going down? Buy 2 more options at the same price. 

8) rinse and repeat, doubling your position. 

9) have an exit strategy. Tell yourself, “if this gets to negative $200 (or $400 or $800 or whatever your risk tolerance is) I will sell these options and take the loss. 

10) when option is in the green, set a stop market sale order for a few cents lower than the current mark? Trading at $.85? Set a stop at .75. If it moves up, increase you stop number. 

11) don’t be greedy. Hitting a few singles and doubles and maybe (MAYBE) an occasional triple is way better than striking out going for a home run. 

12) I can’t stress this enough, Do. Not. Be. Greedy. Quickest way to lose $8000 in a day is to not be satisfied with your call doubling in price and then watching it all get wiped out by an unforeseen market event. I’m

2021-04-06 17:32:07,stocks,I would be a little concerned on earnings post COVID. Mask making and other home projects may have given them a boost during the pandemic.
2021-04-06 19:29:43,stocks,"OP I believe MIK struck a deal to go private which is why it will trade virtually unchanged at around $22 (~$3B). Also, comparing just share price is misplaced.

With that said, I firmly believed last week that JOAN offered the best medium term value buying opportunity that I saw in the market when it was down to around $10, purely based on normalizing valuation. Disclosure, I opened my position then, but I’d still buy now near $12. I think $15.75ish is a pessimistic valuation with upside to $24-$30 depending how earnings play out post COVID and whether the new customers fade or keep buying.

To put it this way, even if they perform at 80% of last years earnings, current price would value them at a P/E of 3-4."
2021-04-06 19:44:05,stocks,"I think there's is an interesting value play here now that they are now profitable and have strong free cash flows. PE = 2 if my math is correct.

My concerns are that they have attributed the 2020 increase in revenue to COVID-19 and people doing more DIY projects and it could be an anomaly once things open up. In 2019 pre-covid they had a net loss of $546M. Another concern is that they have $635M debt due in 2023 which is going to completely eat all their free cash flow for the next two years unless they roll it further out. 

Definitely gonna add them to my watchlist though."
2021-04-06 18:08:06,stocks,"I like the stock as a short term play, but long term I’m
not sure. As someone mentioned earlier we’ll have to see how things play out post Covid. I believe they were able to take advantage of competitors being out of stock on some items. Actually went to a Joann’s last Friday’s because some items my wife was looking for were out at Hobby Lobby. Prices were slightly higher, and barely anyone in the store."
2021-04-06 17:52:08,stocks,"aside from the fact that Michael’s has 2x as many shares outstanding as Joann’s, I’d say this stock is priced where it should be."
2021-04-06 17:40:50,stocks,"I agree,but even post COVID their stock price should be closer to that of one of their closest competitors which is Michael’s. Except Michael’s doesn’t offer the fabric sewing side."
2021-04-06 19:30:50,stocks,"Maybe it's store dependent, but I've been to a nearby Michaels and like half the store was fabrics, or did I misunderstand what you meant?"
2021-04-06 19:33:53,stocks,That might be for certain stores because of all the stores I’ve been to they don’t sell fabrics like Joanne nor do the have anywhere near the selection of high end sewing machines and embroidery machines. Hobby lobby has a big fabric section but are lacking in the high end sewing and embroidery
2021-04-06 19:35:31,stocks,"Gotcha, could be.  I don't regularly buy fabrics, I went to my local one to pick up some mosquito netting they had for some DIY camping stuff and it had a lot of fabrics, guess they do some tailoring based on the local market which could be a good sign."
2021-04-06 17:53:55,stocks,"I think you've learned you should take risks, and you've really embraced that, but I think this is fairly reckless. You should still have some balance to your portfolio, it's just that maybe you don't need bonds, not that you should have most of your portfolio in high risk stocks. 

&#x200B;

Something that is often missed about younger investors is that capital preservation is key, because of the power of compounding. Yeah, you can 2000% if you get lucky and time it right, but you could just as easily lose 50%, and then you have to double your money just to get back to where you were. If you can make 10%+ over 30, 40 years, you'll retire a multi-millionaire most likely, and you really don't have to take crazy risks for that. 

&#x200B;

Innovation, including e-sports... There's a lot of hype, stupid valuations and unproven businesses in that sector. Even if your investments are profitable, it's plausible your opportunity cost is great. 

&#x200B;

It might be worth setting some goals. For example, I have 5% put aside for speculative investments, and my aim is to have 70% of my holdings in solid companies (these range from JNJ to MSFT - basically stable companies with solid track records and decent growth), and then 15% in higher risk (of which 1/3 of that speculative) and 15% in low risk, think AT&T, National Grid, etc. Perhaps cap yourself to no more than say 8% in one company - especially until you're really confident - and 25% in one sector. I'm in my early 30s and also new, plus I'm playing with not just my money but my wife's, so being careful... Tweak those numbers how you see fit, but it's good to have an honest review of your portfolio IMO. 

&#x200B;

Also within those sectors, ask why you are owning a stock. If you can't give a 60 second summary to your mother, look for an exit. Have an idea of your buy in, your sale point, is it a turnaround or a value play or etc. Understand the numbers likewise and do some due diligence. 

&#x200B;

Ultimately your money but your seeking out advise so there's my 2 cents.

Good luck!"
2021-04-06 17:48:24,stocks,"You can be risk loving with index funds, 100% into VTI is pretty high risk compared with a portfolio of 80% stocks/20% bonds.

But you should be aware that higher risk does not always correlate with higher returns because not everything is a *priced* risk. For example, if you yolo all your money onto one stock, that is a lot of risk, but *on average* you would not expect higher returns than the market, because it is not a *priced* risk (what makes something a priced risk is a bit complicated that I wont get into). Of course, it might go up significantly more than the market, but you dont know, you might as well go put it all on black, that's high risk as well and if it hits you've certainly beaten the market. High risk high reward right?

If you are going to pick stocks, stick to things you *know*, where you have an advantage. Do you work for Domino's and have been seeing sales skyrocket recently? Use that knowledge, you can estimate that the company might beat earnings estimates and the price will go up. But if you invest in things you *dont* know, you're on the same playing field as everyone else, what makes you think you know better than them?"

2021-04-06 16:36:06,stocks,"You are 100% right on the reason for the cap on Roth contributions. Not only that - you have to below a certain income threshold to be able to contribute to a Roth IRA.

You’re correct - I would max your Roth first then brokerage.

If you’re married - you can have your spouse open a Roth and contribute $6,000 in there annually as well. The spouse needs to have taxable income in order to be able to do this."
2021-04-06 17:00:45,stocks,"Capital gains taxes are still done by tax bracket, so unless you’re making a lot it won’t really affect you in the near term. 

The limit to Roth’s is because it’s supposed to be a retirement account, not a yolo account. It’s just supposed to make you comfortable in retirement, not make you rich. You can however actively trade in it, and still become rich through wisely picked stocks. 

Now to the ETFs. ETFs and mutual funds are the least risky way to make money, and you can’t go wrong with them. Warren Buffet tells people to buy ETFs because they will outperform the majority of investors. If you buy ETFs at regular intervals, with a decent percent of your pay, you will retire comfortably. 

But the reason ETFs do wellis because investors are terrible at taking gains when it’s time, and terrible at not getting caught up in hype. Anyone that bought GME after the fist squeeze was gambling, and it’s those people that drive the “80% of people lose money” stat. 

I would recommend buying ETFs for a year or two, and try looking at the companies that those ETFs hold. While you may not want to pick stocks, even picking just a few can greatly improve your portfolio performance while still allowing your ETFs to help you during the bumps. For example, Home Depot is a pretty boring construction retailer. They don’t do anything crazy, they are very reliable with few competitors. HD is part of your ETFs more than likely, but for the last 10 years it went up 751% vs the S&P 500 going up like 204%.

2021-04-06 17:52:07,stocks,"Correction -- you can actually contribute to a spouse's IRA regardless of whether or not the spouse has earned income. Just as long as the working spouse has sufficient earned income. For example, if the working spouse earns at least $12k and the non-working spouse earns $0, there's no reason the working spouse can't max out both IRAs. This is a good option in situations where, say, one spouse is the breadwinner and the other spouse is a homemaker/SAHM."

Downsides are that you only have one trade window in the morning for free so your purchasing is a bit limited. If you want foreign exchanges I would check to see if the tickers you want are available on m1 before investing money or transferring your brokerage account. M1 only includes tickers that meet their unwritten requirements. Therefore there are some symbols in the foreign markets that don’t appear.

2021-04-06 16:30:42,stocks,"There are several to choose from. From more established lithium players to junior startups. There are essentially four types of lithium mining: hard rock, evaporation ponds, clay, and direct lithium extraction (DLE) from brines. The latter two are the new kids on the block and show a lot of potential, but have not yet been proven for mass production of lithium. 

I’m partial to lithium producers wanting to utilize DLE technology because of the environmental benefits. With evaporation ponds, brines are pumped to the surface and evaporated in giant ponds. This uses up massive amounts of water in some of the driest regions in the world, and the process takes up to two years. But with DLE technology, the process only takes a few hours and the water can be returned right back into the ground afterwards. This process also yields extremely pure, battery-grade lithium. 

A few of the newer lithium producers that want to utilize DLE technology include Lake Resources (LLKKF), E3 Metals (EEMMF), Standard Lithium
(STLHF), and Vulcan Energy (VULNF). These are all penny stocks with good risk/reward potential. The first two have subreddits with more info if you’re interested to learn more. 

But you’ll need to do your own research, of course, and see what kind of lithium mining you would want to invest in."

I’m not familiar with Nel ASA. Hydrogen?"

2021-04-06 16:11:39,stocks,"I’m not an expert, or a money making savant, but long calls (1-2 year) I’m not super interested in spikes, but long term accrual of value, but weeklies / monthlies, probably better to sell the spike and buy back in (if you hold a long term outlook) when IV calms back down.

Timing the peak however, anyone’s guess. If options have doubled/tripled over a day or two, consider profit taking and monitor closely for reasoning.

As for taking the L, ideally you didn’t buy something based on hype / high IV that gets crushed, if you did, (and I did on Nok after GME train derailed first time), think if you could makes money work harder elsewhere in the same time interval/are there any catalysts coming up?

If there isn’t anything coming up you’re aware of, cash out and play roulette."
2021-04-06 17:20:08,stocks,"Put more simply - you have the time to make those decisions.  When you are up 100% always sell half, that way the trade is free and you can let the rest of your shares or contracts run up, or down, no loss of your initial cost basis after that though. L

You Can hold, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take profits from time to time though - but usually I hold something for 1-2 months or until I’m satisfied by the percent gain.  I would also hold up to a -30% loss but beyond that I will clip the trade for a loss."

Like I had Disney from 175 to 200 and Boeing from 195 to 250.  That took like 1.5 months and my 2022 contracts went up 100% !!!  So LEAP contracts (1 year+) are not only safe but you can get crazy returns as well!"

2021-04-06 16:54:26,stocks,"Pick one or two areas and stick to your thing, don't trade what others trade. If you jump on -let's say EV's- now, because there's a bit of a dip (but lack your own DD), how one can find the fortitude to hold if they go sideways or bearish?

Seems like you're in between a swing trader and a value investor. Trade certain time frames if you want to do a swing (i.e. 1-2 weeks for a quick one, or up to 5-6 months and out regardless of P/L). Might want to combine fundamentals and technical analysis (basic stuff: market cap, earnings, ratios and support levels and ceilings; it has to be simple to follow).

And, possibly, a last note on psychology. Anyone can agree what's a right path, in hindsight. The difficulty remains on doing the appropriate thing when the metal is hot. Adding to the right loser, being a contrarian and that kind of uncomfortable stuff. Coping with losses, is the name of the game."
2021-04-06 15:24:02,stocks,"Last year was a bull run, this year has been extremely volatile and we had a market correction back in February and various other shenanigans that have made things move up and down in disproportionate ways since.

I’d say try not to worry about it if your losses were based on things out of your control. If you think a company will grow at a desirable rate, buy it because trying to time the market is hard normally but especially hard right now (I can’t say I always follow my own advice but I do believe it to be true). If a limit order is missed then you should either put it out of your mind because the price point was not attractive to you, or try to adjust what an attractive price point looks like. 

I’d keep some cash on hand in case of another dip but besides that just keep doing what you’re doing. A losing trade today might pay-off big in a few years."

2021-04-06 15:20:18,stocks,"Dude if you have decided to buy or sell something then just do it. Don't set a limit order that may or may not fill just to save a couple bucks. For example, if I am going to buy a stock that is at $689 (cough cough TSLA cough) then I set the limit order at $690 so that I get fills in the $680s and not exceeding $690. The time to cheap out is NOT when you have high conviction on your picks."

2021-04-06 15:45:00,stocks,"I came here to say this. I chased semiconductor stocks around for a bit, hitting some but mostly losing. Individual semi stocks have been pretty volatile. I moved into SMH instead. It has smoothed the ups and downs. Even today, SMH is only down 1.3% +/-."

I’m holding long term (15+ years)...just FYI what’s driving my decisions."
2021-04-06 16:20:32,stocks,That sounds like a good idea. But I have read disclaimers at my brokers which say that trailing stop limits are not 100% guaranteed to be triggered. Or any conditional trade for that matter. Ever since I have stuck to entering the market/limit orders myself. I could be wrong though since I never actually tried it myself.

2021-04-06 14:41:42,stocks,Is it possible your broker is charging you a small fee? I've seen that on a few sales at TDA where they charged my $0.01 regulatory fee. You should be able to see for sure on your order confirmation you get like 2-3 business days later.
2021-04-06 15:16:04,stocks,This is a regulatory fee. All brokers must charge by law. So even if your broker allows free trades they all are required to charge this fee. Most of the time it’s .02 cents.
2021-04-06 14:48:52,stocks,"Sounds like slippage, although I would have thought slippage wouldn't be a thing if you use limit orders..."
2021-04-06 15:40:24,stocks,Could be they show the commission in that number instead of separately?
2021-04-06 16:06:36,stocks,are you using the active trader app... because that charges a small selling fee

2021-04-06 14:47:44,stocks,"I mean I've only seen those fees attached when I sell my etf shares. So I figure it's related to that. 

But who know, hopefully you figure it out. Cause pennies add up over time."

2021-04-06 14:53:34,stocks,I haven't so I'll try that going forward.
2021-04-06 14:56:53,stocks,I haven't sold leaving out the decimals so this would be awesome to find out.
2021-04-06 15:00:06,stocks,"Yeah I figured my example of 400 would be the same as 400.00 but maybe it leaves that little bit of wiggle room open. I've also encountered the situation where I've sold several shares and it'll be fractions of a cent off. Example, 20 shares at 4.9997 is now 99.99 instead of 20 shares at $5 giving me $100. It's annoying"
2021-04-06 16:00:09,stocks,"I'm on fidelty as well - it is a commision/fee. It should be detailed if you look at the Activities & Orders page, scroll down to History, and click on a sell trade, it will list the fee"

2021-04-06 15:01:11,stocks,Just give TD your RH statements. They'll manually enter it for you.
2021-04-06 15:10:37,stocks,You can probably manually enter them in. I xferred from RH to fidelity and none of the basis were there. I manually entered them in. I also run a spreadsheet with them so it was an easy do. Obviously for massive amounts of trades this is not the best option but at least for some.
2021-04-06 16:10:36,stocks,My cost basis took almost a month and a half before it was correct.

2021-04-06 14:40:00,stocks,"I’m all in on steel, up over 250% and I expect to see significant gains in the upcoming months.  
Market is insane for industrials / commodity sector, things are looking good."
2021-04-06 15:22:58,stocks,"ABB I think has alot of room for growth. 3rd largest industrial automation vendor in NA, 3rd largest worldwide. They are really the only big dog in the electrical/industrial/automation sector that has a strong robotics offering in addition to all their electrical/mechanical hardware and software. I think that is going to become huge in the next decade, and ABB has alot of unrealized potential. Neither Rockwell, Honeywell, Emerson, Siemens, or Schneider really have anything close to a true robotics division. Mitsubishi does have a legit robotics division but they have no presence in NA really at all.

Rockwell is going to dominate the small-mid sized factory automation software/ industrial equipment for the next 20 years in NA. Siemens is going to dominate it in Europe. Asia is a free-for-all, and whoever dominates that over the next decade is going to have an insane market cap.

Large sized automation is going to be dominated by Honeywell/Emerson/ABB. I see Honeywell on the downtrend because their primary market is O&G, but Honeywell is still an otherwise solidly run company with many government contracts and they are extremely well diversified so I wouldn't bet against them. If you think the bio/pharma industry is going to surge then Emerson is the buy as they completely dominate the lifesciences industry."

2021-04-06 14:43:45,stocks,Right there with you. I have CLF 01/22 20c calls. Maybe I’m splitting hairs but I call that my “commodities” exposure.

2021-04-06 15:21:03,stocks,Noted. This is the kind of stuff I’m talking about. Concerned about the run they’ve been on + lack of meaty dividend. I will be asking around ppl I know on this company.

2021-04-06 13:53:26,stocks,"What are their market caps?

The tl;dr is that each CHPT share is significantly less ownership of the company than each share of BLNK is, so they are worth less. If I offered you 1/1000000 ownership of GM for $10 or 1/2 ownership of Ford for $500, would you ask why the Ford share is so much more expensive?"
2021-04-06 14:02:35,stocks,Learn market caps ASAP.
2021-04-06 13:56:13,stocks,It's not though? CHPT trades almost 700% higher.
2021-04-06 13:57:06,stocks,Because share price cannot be compared between two different businesses.
2021-04-06 14:24:34,stocks,Nobody should invest until you understand this concept
2021-04-06 14:18:22,stocks,"Wow had no idea this was a thing, thank you so much ! However I am still confused, isnt owning half of ford for $500 a much better deal? Im not math wizard so I can be completely wrong but I definitely get the point."
2021-04-06 14:11:57,stocks,Wouldnt a larger market cap be a good thing?  CHPT has a larger market cap by like 500% . Idk anything about market caps so will definitely do some reading soon!
2021-04-06 14:10:11,stocks,CHPT is around $30 rn and BLNK is around $40 along with BLNK has a daily trading volume of 8.9 million shares while CHPT is 4.5 million shares.
2021-04-06 14:12:39,stocks,But its the same exact industry so I feel like you can absolutely compare the two.
2021-04-06 14:36:04,stocks,"Well here I am ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

And just to defend my fellow apes who dont know the \*basics\* IMO if you read enough news, both economic and political about various countries and companies one can absolutely invest and do well. With that said knowing basics absolutely would make me a better trader, but I have done pretty well without knowing anything besides for being able to see what the future is like weed and green energy companies or technology companies like PLTR and APPL"
2021-04-06 14:23:35,stocks,"Yes, it is. In the same way that paying $35 for a much bigger portion of BLNK might be a better deal than paying $20 for a much smaller portion of CHPT"
2021-04-06 14:26:28,stocks,No - market cap is directly influenced by stock price so high market cap could mean stock is overpriced. Look up market cap formula.
2021-04-06 14:43:37,stocks,"CHPT is worth $8B, and BLNK is worth $1.7B. Stock price means less than nothing. If you invest $100 in a company worth $200 total, and one worth $1000, what company do you own more of? What difference does it make if it's cut into 100 shares at $1, or 2 shares at $50?"
2021-04-06 14:20:38,stocks,"That's not how any of this works. You're comparing apples and bananas, and then criticizing the banana for not being round or red enough.   

Go back to basics. A company is worth shares \* price, when outstand shares increases price goes down, but value goes up as measured by market caps. Therefore, comparing two companies by price alone is as wrong as you can get."
2021-04-06 14:52:39,stocks,You posted yesterday that you were down 35%
2021-04-06 15:34:18,stocks,"I sort of agree with you, investing in ideas and not numbers has been sort of a driving force behind current growth stocks. But the reason you should understand a concept like this is because it could cause big missteps. 

If you’re comparing two stocks and you’re only comparing the price and the news they’re reporting then you’re missing a lot of important info. 

I like green energy and weed too, but my “green and green🔥” strategy has so far lost money for me because I didn’t fully understand how much of the “it’s the future!” speculation was already built into the price. 

Anyway, you asked a question, got an answer and learned from it, so that’s good and you should be even more excited about trading now that you’ll be making better informed decisions."
2021-04-06 15:27:42,stocks,".....if you have the time to read the news and understand macro/microeconomics, i would think you have the time to understand what market cap considering it's a very simple topic but ok pop off i guess"
2021-04-06 16:06:02,stocks,"You must have just started trading this year. It will not be like this every year. Your reasoning is kind of like those who bought Lucid at $60 because they ""believed"" in the company. Most people who bought at $60 probably didn't know this concept, look at how they're doing now. What if your weed and green companies already have 10 years of extreme success baked into the stock price? Then your ability to ""see the future"" wouldn't even matter."
2021-04-06 14:25:30,stocks,ooooh okay ahaha idk why I thought in your analogy that Ford had to be the bad one regardless of anything
2021-04-06 15:43:20,stocks,I consider that good with how bad everything tanked. Only lose when you pull out ;) ahaha and learn to take a joke
2021-04-06 15:44:10,stocks,Yeah like i said earlier definitely should know these things but to act like knowing basics is the end all be all is absurd
2021-04-06 17:06:23,stocks,"Think of it like having 2 chocolate cakes of the same size but each one is cut into a different number of slices. The one with more slices obviously has smaller slices of cake, while the one with less slices has bigger slices, thus that cake's bigger slices are more valuable than the smaller slices of the other cake.

edit: because everyone wants a bigger slice of cake."
2021-04-06 15:49:36,stocks,"For reference, FZROX (US Total Market Index Fund) is up 9% for the year. So joke or not, down 35% for the year is abysmal. 

I'm not trying to be mean or hurt your feelings, I just want to put things in perspective because new traders often overestimate their performance and ignore their bad picks while focusing on their good picks, skewing their perspective."
2021-04-06 16:12:09,stocks,"Being down 35% is good because how “bad everything tanked”? Bro the general stock market is doing really well rn. The S&P 500 and the DOW are making new highs and have been doing fine the past month. The NASDAQ saw a minor correction from $14,000 to like $12,900 now its trending back up."
2021-04-06 16:24:59,stocks,"What kind of reasoning is this? Basics are the basics for a reason. They’re the foundation to build your knowledge on. Instead of recognizing this, you’re doubling down on your ignorance with the justification that you’ve done well so far. 

Why are you even asking people’s opinions when you just ignore them anyway?"
2021-04-06 19:08:02,stocks,"But in the case of Blink, think of it as slices of a turd."
2021-04-06 19:51:22,stocks,Lol thanks for the edit and its 100% clear thank you sir
2021-04-06 18:11:57,stocks,Down 12% now bae
2021-04-06 19:12:16,stocks,I mean what reasoning is there to explain that an ape throwing darts at a board had a better portfolio for a couple years then top HF’s. Im not saying basics are important but if the market was as predictable as math is then major HF’s would never lose money. Im not saying your wrong im just saying your not right.
2021-04-06 19:14:40,stocks,"And the reason im asking is bc I can, its the same reason you are responding, its bc you can. And like i said in other comments, I will go do reading, had no idea that market caps were anything like they are, so i got the information i needed. Its just when people take this shit dumb seriously like im majoring in marketing is when i will clown you for being clowns. Now have a good day and thank you for the info"
2021-04-06 19:16:49,stocks,What stocks are you invested in? Being down 35% yesterday and now your portfolio went up 23% in one day! You must be in penny stocks if your portfolio has this much volatility.
2021-04-06 19:49:06,stocks,"Its mainly two bad option plays i should of cashed in on before the “crash” and got way to greedy and paid have paid the price with no sign of federal legislation in sight ( for my options play ). But every stock i own im in the positive still besides for CHPT, hence the post and really what I feel like the reason is, 1, buying a company like CHPT before a merger is a bad idea because for some reason idc to really know majority of stock tank after mergers which it did, it tanked like 10% the day after. That sucked but learned.  And second big thing i misjudged was Biden’s weird hatred for marijuana. I assumed he would of past a massive justice reform bill by now with AG Garland which would decriminalized weed federally and expunge prior weed records at least and as we know now, that train is slow moving. However I am still deeply bullish that a weed fed bill will come and if they are smart they will tie the taxes from weed to social programs thus directly connecting the weed industry to helping the country and making up for his awful bills he passed back during the 80’s which would propel the industry massive forward."
2021-04-06 15:34:50,stocks,"Fidelity ZERO total market index fund (FZROX) in a Roth IRA. Zero minimums to open an account or make an initial investment and you can invest any amount into it at any time going forward up to $6,000 yearly. Best of all, absolutely NO fee involved with that fund. It’s just as good as Vanguard’s total market fund and is even cheaper. 

I would suggest the same fund in a separate taxable brokerage account as well. It’s good to have some outside of retirement investing as well to save and grow your money for goals that are closer than retirement.

You can start stock picking and buying some fractional shares of stocks you like when they dip once you have a good foundation set."
2021-04-06 13:59:11,stocks,"Put your money into a large investment firm like Fidelity and pick one of their high cap growth funds and start plowing money into it.  As much as you can.  One of my biggest regrets in life is not getting more education, asking for more raises, or asking the cute girl in High School out on a date.  I regret spending the vast majority of my money on absolutely worthless shit.  I just turned 40 and I have a decent nest egg set up, but I didn't get my head squared on my shoulders until I was about 30, so if I had started at 20, I would be a millionaire right now.

It doesn't matter if you can only save $100 a month, it matters that you start saving early in life and as much as you can.  Compound interest will kick your account in the balls around the $500k mark, and once you get over $1M you will be banking a year's salary just in interest.

Can second everyone saying that starting as early as possible is critical: I'm 24, started when I was your age and I've been able to make some fairly significant returns over the past 6 years (I'm not just indexing, but it remains about 1/3 of my portfolio)"

2021-04-06 13:53:47,stocks,"Depends what you want from your investments. You can go for dividends and start building up a passive income or reinvest the dividends. Dividend stocks usually have very little company growth but offer a 2-3%+ annual dividend for passive income.

Growth stocks are more volatile and higher risk but offer greater returns if done well. This takes lots of research to get comfortable picking your own stocks so you should probably hold off on this until you research the stock market and get some practice analyzing companies.

The safest thing you can do is invest into index funds, ideally anything that tracks the SP500 with it's historical returns of 10-12% annually averaged over decades."

Education is very useful, even if only for having the required degree that recruiters use as minimal barem for even considering your application, unlocking opprtunities. It also teaches you skills.
 
Emerency savings are important because, well, you never know when you'll hit a hard place and need the money. 6 months worth of net income is a good place to start.
 
Investing early can also do a huge difference over the long run as interests cumulate. Maybe that portfolio, which appears insignificant today, will one day become your cashdown on a first house, or maybe help you start a business, or help you pay for a dream vacation or sabatical year to spend time with your first child.  Important to start early.
 
Last, but not least, don't forget to keep some for you to enjoy today. You could die tomorrow or wake up old and unrealized. Carpe diem."

2021-04-06 17:08:35,stocks,"At 22, I got my first job after school and my Mom and Dad sat me down.  I had paid my own way through school by working in high school and attending college parallel to my military commitment, so I had no debt.

They say me down to tell me I had a rare opportunity with my first ""real"" paycheck. So I committed to 15% 401K, a Roth IRA commitment of $425 a month, a stock index fund of $425 a month, and saving $1,250 a month for a mortgage.

In 5 years, I had $90,000 in my 401K, I had $40,000 in my Roth, $50,000 in my index fund, and a down payment on a $130,000 starter home of $65,000.

In 10 years, I had $400,000 in my 401K, I had $130,000 in my Roth, $165,000 in my index fund, and a mortgage paid in full on that $130,000 starter home now valued at $185,000.

In 15 years, I had $780,000 in my 401K, I had $280,000 in my Roth, $160,000 in my index fund, and sold my starter home in a down market for $205,000 and took $95,000 and bought a foreclosure property sold two years before at $474,500 for the balance remaining around $300,000.

In 20 years, I had $1.35M in my 401K, I had $340,000 in my Roth, $250,000 in my index fund, and no mortgage on a house valued at $425,000.

I'm 31 years in now.  It works.  My 401K has tripled to over $3 million, as have my Roth and index funds, and the house is at $565,000.  

Two Important Tips: Always pay your credit cards in full and buy depreciating assets with cash outright.  You don't need a yacht or a sports car.  Live simply and avoid temptation beyond travel.  That builds your mind.

In short, there is an order to things that makes a lot of sense.   For instance, one should build up 6 months of an emergency fund before they consider investing in the stock market.  There is a flowchart linked to on the wiki which shows this graphically as well.   

When you get to investing, you should visit r/Bogleheads and the page at [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting\_started](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started) to understand why index funds are a good thing.

If you want the very short tl;dr;: at your age, buy VT every chance you get, probably in a Roth IRA, which you should max out if possible.    Personally, I'd probably open the Roth at Vanguard, buy VT until I got to $3K and then switch to a Vanguard target date fund appropriate for your age (which has $3K minimum).   Or, if you don't want any bonds (which will be in the target date fund) initially, you could just continue buying VT or the mutual fund equivalent of VTWAX."

2021-04-06 19:15:16,stocks,GREAT QUESTION! The postings who suggested  investing in 401k and Roth IRA and regular IRA are spot on. I did this early on and I am sitting nice. You are young so put all of your money in the stock options available to you and contribute at least 10% and certainly more if you can. Then once you set it you forget and let it work for you over thirty years. You won’t be disappointed. Even if the markets crashes you will be making money. Also speak to a financial advisor for more opportunities. If your job does not have these programs available your financial advisor can help you set up your own 401k plan with Roth and regular IRA. Do all three of you can. Best of luck to you and enjoy the ride.

Investopedia and your broker (if not get a good one if you can,) should provide you with education as well.  I know Fidelity and TDAmeritrade have good learning resources to help you decide.

Generally:

-Video Games (specifically ones with eSports)

-A variety of small pharmaceuticals - This is a play that I actually did do years ago, and basically some flopped, some stayed the same, but the ones that grew went up by like 10x

-Market ETFs

Specific:

-Hasbro - I am extremely bullish on Hasbro for reasons I can’t fit here.

-Disney - Always healthy never going anyway, park growth, and I don’t believe that all the success and potential of Disney+ is baked into the price yet.

-Nokia - What most analysts and Redditors already know, but many retail investors do not, is that Nokia has basically transformed from a phone company into a technology infrastructure company and will be integral to the future of technology and communication.

Also, I personally have drank the GameStop kool-aid and believe the stock will have a few more explosive moments of growth, but even if you don’t I think it’s reaching a point where owning some as a hedge against the market is good. At various points through the saga, when GME went up, the market went down.

2021-04-06 15:51:22,stocks,"As others will mention, index funds are traditionally very safe. You can dollar cost average in -- meaning you'll invest 10 or 20% of whatever you make in a given month into the fund. This way you just keep buying on a regular basis and ignore what the market does. In the long run, it'll go up. Ignore short term variance. 

Having said that, you're young and I think you can take more risk. 

Electric vehicles are the future, as is any technology that fights climate change. Tesla is the leader in EVs, has a chance to make robotaxis work, and developing grid scale batteries which are going to help eliminate oil and gas infrastructure in this country. I think anyone owning Tesla now will be very happy in 10 years.

Also I'd say have 1-5% of your portfolio consist of Bitcoin, Etheruem, or some other leader in the alt coin space. 

And make sure you travel. It is 100% worth spending *some* (not all) of your money learning new skills (dance, tennis, rock climbing etc) and traveling to have new experiences and meet new people.

So it comes down to whether you believe you will make more money in the future. If you will make more money in the future and pay higher taxes than you do now (or if you think income taxes will go up), then pay the taxes now to avoid paying taxes later by investing through a Roth IRA.

2021-04-06 16:51:42,stocks,"This may not be the answer you're looking for, but another good way, in general, to invest is property. Obviously, the crash of '08 wasn't fantastic but the market crashed too then. Either can happen. There are a lot of programs to help out with a down payment for first time homebuyers to get you started, but no programs for fist time stock market investors. Selling a house can be the egg that gets you started in the market.

I have bought 2 houses and had friends pay me rent that went to my mortgage. While all my friends were throwing away money on rent, I was creating value for myself  I fixed each place up little by little and sold them for a healthy profit. The first profit I used to move across the country, and the second I have invested into a 401k, and the market in general.

The housing market is the same as stocks to an extent. Research is key. Look at the ""sold"" category on zillow to help you determine comps in an area and whether it's going up or down. Also, when making upgrades pay attention to trends and what kind of buyers you'll be selling to. Don't put high end fixtures in a middle class neighborhood, it's a waste. But also don't put in tile that was popular 10 years ago just cause it's on sale.

Add to that the fact that part time students work less hours per year and you will have substantially less time off when you’re graduated, don’t bother with saving now. Live life. Make sure you’re not homeless and you’re stable but put off the heavy investing until you’re a full time worker.

2021-04-06 17:03:06,stocks,"I think u/Kirbus69 nails it, but to re-emphasise - pretax contributions into a 401k, especially if your employer matches, is an amazing tool.

&#x200B;

Your biggest asset is time, of which you have more than most on here. Time in the market beats almost anything else, and your safest bet is likely index funds. You've got some great recommendations on here for low-cost indexes, though keep in mind you rarely have those as options in your 401k - the companies that manage 401ks typically offer programs that have a higher cost ratio, since they have to make their money somehow. Don't be afraid to ask about what you have on offer, don't be afraid to switch your assets within the 401k - often they will still offer a menu of options, and the target date funds are fine but usually pretty conservative. You have time to be aggressive, so use it. But if you have contributions of, say, 10% into your 401k, and your employer matches 5%, and say you contribute the max amount into a Roth each year (which in 2021 is $6,000), you will retire a millionaire. 

&#x200B;

That being said, don't just focus on making money. Time is valuable, and impossible to recover.

What I wish I did was consitently, like a car payment, added to an S&P 500 index fund every month no matter what. That would have built up to a tremendous amount at this point, but instead I fucked around and didn't keep adding, I got bored and would leave my investments. The thing is with the stock market, if you play individual stocks or whatever for a while you'll eventually fall out of it, you'll just want stuff to sit and you won't do as well, so if this sounds like something that would happen to you then you need to only do index funds for the full indices not sectors.

2021-04-06 17:31:19,stocks,"Build your emergency fund and then once it is appropriately cushioned start putting the rest into risk-appropriate investments. Risk-appropriate is defined by you, type of investment is defined by you, but many of us grew up raised by folks who battered ""save save save!"" into our brains and never once *seriously* discussed investing. 

Savings are good, but they do not grow (particularly in the economy of today) and once you have your emergency fund the rest of your cash can start getting to work for you, however you want to define that. Don't let it rot in the bank.

Pay yourself first: after the emergency fund is good to go, grab an IRA or other vehicle and set up your auto deposit when you can afford it. After that, do the same for a brokerage account or other fund(s), obviously again when you can afford it. Move your money before you give yourself time to spend it. The hardest part is starting. Set it up on auto, and let yourself ""accidentally"" save for your future. 

I should have started an IRA the second I could afford it. After that, I should have then been adding $100, $50 even just $20 here and there into a basic brokerage account or index fund (ETFs didn't exist then, I would say those today).

I’d say, any spare change, Max out your Roth IRA first. Your income is small, your taxes are low.  Next move would be to max your 401k.  Afterward, save for a house.  Do this while you are learning everything possible about the best investors in the world.  I’ve taken liking to Ray Dalio and Charles Munger and have read their books.

After you’ve gotten your Roth and 401k maxed with the boring Vanguard plays, it’s time to try to make it big.  Risking $2-5k a year, you can learn a ton about trading, macro economics, and trends.  You’ll grow as a person and your understanding of the world.  I’ve always taken the mindset that I can reduce costs of living in order to make high risk plays.  

I started looking at investing as asymmetrical bets.  Where there is a 50% chance to lose 33% and a 50% chance to make 5X, you take that bet every time. 

Anyways, read everything you can on personal finance. I’d say that’s hands down your best investment if you want to take fate into your own hands.  It’s paid off for me.

By keeping some money on the side you allow yourself to average down and make yourself more gains in the future.

Many say an index fund, but that’s actually ridiculous advice for an 18 year old. You buy a market index when you have too much money to lose. 

At 18 your risk and your capital are far too low to be that conservative, it’s a waste of your best years for compounding. 

Identify a company or two that you feel strongly about it’s current and it’s future prospects, do due diligence and sink your money into it and wait. 

You do not need to be a genius stock picker, but you do need to be patient. 

Before putting money in (there is no need to rush) take the opportunity to learn new things in this process, and take risks on yourself. Read investing books, inspire yourself to do some research and when you’re ready, open up your position."

Web sites sucked and it was all about the information back in those days.  Yahoo wasn't even an option then.

Back in those days Coca Cola was still cheap.  I don't think anyone was investing in tech stocks.  People were probably investing in insurance companies and media stocks back in those days.  New York Times, whatever.  Best tech options were probably Nintendo and Sony in those days.

You want to know what I was doing back in those days?  A lot of designer clothing. That would have been a great investment in the nineties.  None of those labels had a big IPO but prices rose until the 2000s.  None of those stocks are worth shit now.  If you timed it right back then there were definite opportunities to make money."

Coca-Cola (both CCEP and KO) my father put me in that when I was younger via buying stock direct from Computershare.

I was able to use some of that money to better myself when it came in. Like I said if I were to do it all again I would have put more of my own money into it on a period basis and capitalize off of dividend reinvestment so I can one day retire with good dividends coming in from a company that I know will be there. Couple that with the rest of my 401Ks and IRAs. Nice!!

The other thing I would have done was put money in DIA if I would have known about it sooner. Monthly dividends getting reinvested along with the growth of the Index over these last 20 years since high school would have had me very comfortable right now."
2021-04-06 19:20:46,stocks,"In my opinion, where the money is matters a lot more right now than what you invest the money in.

Start a Roth IRA with one of the main mortgage brokers Schwab, Fidelity, vanguard, etc.

Fund the Roth with whatever you can. If you're able to do this in the next month your contribution can count for 2020. Contributions are capped at $6k per year.

Since you're 18 I imagine it's not a ton of money. And return on investment scales with the amount you were able to invest. The difference between a 5% and 20% return on investment is huge. But if you only have $5,000 to invest the dollar difference is only $750. This is why where you invest matters more than what you invest in.

A Roth can act as 3 important things:

1. Emergency fund. 
You can withdraw contributions at any time without penalty and without paying taxes. It's only the interest you would potentially pay a penalty on for early withdrawal. Meaning every dollar contributed is available in case of an emergency.

2. Down payment savings for a house. 
You can withdraw everything you contributed as mentioned above. In addition, after 5 years you're able to withdraw up to $10,000 in interest earnings tax and penalty free as a  first time home buyer exception. There are also exceptions for education and healthcare expenses.

3. Retirement. 
Because you paid tax on what you contributed you can withdrawal every dollar of your Roth and retirement without paying a diamond taxes. Additionally you have the choice to retire early and begin withdrawing contributions before 59.5. You also are never forced to take contributions like you are with a 401k or an IRA if you don't need them.

4. Whole Life Insurance policy.
There's no death tax on a Roth. You can will the entire sum to your beneficiaries and they don't have to pay a dime in taxes."

If you lose some money, you'll be okay, but if you make a good amount of money, it could change your quality of life or opportunities in significant ways. Meanwhile, when you're older and have more stability and financial obligations, you want to have your money in safer places and limit the amount you have invested in stocks, which are far more volatile than ETFs, bonds, real estate etc.

2021-04-06 19:32:24,stocks,"1. Get a credit card asap. And start building that credit. Always pay it off every single month and use it like a debit card. Meaning never spend more on your card than you can immediately pay off that day. Credit limit will be low if you dont have a job but the important thing is building credit. The limits will increase as soon as you get a job.
2. Secondly, start investing in low risk mutual funds. Just pick one like voo or something similar and just start autodeposit your spare income into it. Once you see that you can make your money grow, it helps you to save more since that $100 can be $110 in a week/month/year instead of sitting with essentially no interest in a savings account.
3. Get a car payment you can afford. Different types of loans helps build your credit. Worry more about maintenance and repair costs rather than rims and trim.
4. Stay the fuck away from debt as much as you can help it. Debt builds credit but only if you pay it off on time. Im going through the homebuying process right now and im approved for more $ with lower interest than my coworker who is married with two incomes since my debt to income is so low.
5. Finally make a budget and savings plan. Even if you cant stick to it, just knowing how much you make and spend every month (down to the dollar) makes you more money conscious and will prevent you from frivolous spending just by having that info in your head.

Finally have overtaken Intel to become the best overall performing CPU on the market with no plans to take the foot off the pedal (5nm design to be showed by the end of the year)

Projected 50% increase in GPU performance in their next generation of chips, it could be very competitive with Nvidia. Nvida is worth 3x as much as AMD and if AMD can steal market share it will be huge.

2021-04-06 19:51:13,stocks,"Good on you for asking. What's not often publicized is that a good portfolio has almost nothing to do with market performance, picking stocks, but rather time in the market. 

There's a rule of thumb that says a broad index fund position, let's say a S&P 500 fund that tracks the index more or less, will double in value every seven years on average. Now consider that most people don't get their shit together until their early 30s, if they ever do. That's two WHOLE CYCLES of our hypothetical doubling that they're missing out on. So even if you're only contributing $50 a month at first, that money immediately starts accumulating, appreciating, and in some cases paying dividends. Not only that, but you've established good saving habits and as you see the market gains come eventually, it will encourage you to invest more. 

I joined the Army right out of high school and had practically zero bills for 5 years. I had cheap used cars that I paid cash for, and didn't have a cell phone plan until a few years in. While the salary was not much, almost every cent of my income was expendable, and spend it I did, mostly on alcohol and random bullshit. If I had saved half of my take home pay and put it into my Scottrade account, I might be comfortably retired today.

Trust me on this, start now and you will be far ahead of the majority of your peers in retirement savings. Also, never raid your tax-advantaged accounts."

For retirement:

\- Open a roth IRA account and start buying into SPY gradually. SPY tracks the S&P500. Check out this investment calculator: [https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html?ctype=endamount&ctargetamountv=1000000&cstartingprinciplev=1000&cyearsv=40&cinterestratev=10&ccompound=annually&ccontributeamountv=20&cadditionat1=end&ciadditionat1=monthly&printit=0&x=109&y=25](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html?ctype=endamount&ctargetamountv=1000000&cstartingprinciplev=1000&cyearsv=40&cinterestratev=10&ccompound=annually&ccontributeamountv=20&cadditionat1=end&ciadditionat1=monthly&printit=0&x=109&y=25)

If you invest $1,000 in SPY to start, then $20 every month for 40 years, you'll have  **$156,266.22**. (that's based on an average return of 10%/yr). Be sure to ""reinvest dividends"" each time you buy. This is the beauty of COMPOUND INTEREST. FYI, you can't pull $ from a retirement account until age 59.5 without huge penalties.

If you just want some tips on which stocks I think will do well over the next decade because you want some cash in 10 years, here are some of my picks:

\- FISV

\- FSLY

\- SKLZ

\- NVDA

And of course you can never go wrong with AAPL and MSFT.

Do not try to ""time the market,"" because ""time in the market beats timing the market."" Good luck!"

This.

1000 times this.

Yes, yes it does. $100 vs $2000 a month compounded for 30 years at 10% with +-%1 is the difference between $$215,000 and $*4 million.*

Not disagreeing with your major premise by starting as early as possible though.

I would say VTSAX and chill. No bet on growth vs value. No bet on US vs developed markets vs emerging. No bet AMZN, MFST and AAPL will continue to dominate. Just buy everything and forget about it.

I started late myself and hope I can turn it around by being in an aggressive growth account in my 401k and adding a yearly 1% increase."

So yea, any extra money that I don't need normally, I put it in stocks + funds. It's aggressive and risky, but if I lose I have time to earn it back anyways. I'm probably going to keep doing this until I hit late 20s.

Before people start to furiously downvote... there is some method to the madness. When you are young you generally don’t have lots of free money anyway so while broad ETFs have higher expected value, the money isn’t going to be life changing, just good. The option of just YOLOing has lower expected value but because it has much higher variance, it does offer a chance (low chance but still) at life changing play. Since when young you are not risking your life savings and it’s not huge amounts either way (most people earn their entire net worth between 40 and 60)... if I had to go back I would YOLO and hold for a chance at next AMZN. But going with broad ETF isn’t wrong either"

I admit that I didn't do that when I was 18-22 but wish that I did."
2021-04-06 17:52:03,stocks,"I’m gonna go ahead and repost what I said above with a tldr

Tldr: Life isn’t as short as people say (and it’s only getting longer). You can sacrifice some of your youth to see a compounded return on fun via investing in yourself but still have fun while doing so. Fun in your 20s is overrated due to having little funds. Having fun with good money in your 30s (and beyond) is more valuable. You will realize this when you see others that took the other path and thank yourself.


Honestly, I think fun is pretty overrated when we are young. If you save and invest your money you are also investing in future fun. Just like money, fun can be saved and it can grow like compound interest. When I started college I had lots of family/friends that would tell me that I wasn’t living life and that it’s too short to always be studying. Jokes on them. 3 years later I got accepted to a graduate program to become a medical professional. I graduate in 3 more years and if blessed with the opportunity to specialize maybe another 2-4 years more in the form of a paid residency.

I will probably end up with nearly 200k in debt after these 3 years. If I continue to invest and save the money my parents send to help with food, transportation, etc; I could probably knock off a solid 30-40% of that debt. Maybe even more if you take into consideration resident salary. Instead I’ll just pay the interest off, invest the rest, and start working.

When I start after the next 5-7 years, in the field of my desired specialty, I can expect to make a 250-450k a year starting out. So after exactly 1 year, after taxes, I already have the ability to pay off that loan and have some money left over. At this point I am still under 30 years of age.

Before that following year I could get a loan to start my own practice. Sure, it’ll probably take a year before I manage to turn a profit. But once I do, it will be 500k-800k in pure profits every year.

I want to add that I didn’t take into my girlfriend being on her way to doing the same. We’re pretty set on getting married and starting a joint practice that will raise profits approximately 25-30%. By the time she’s done and joins me I will still not have reached 35. Most of those friends I mentioned earlier barely continued education after high school and are either in and out of jails or working harsh dead-end jobs. Due to this, they couldn’t marry or find someone with an education that got them a good paying job. In fact, most of them are stay at home moms or they they are paying child support.

Now idk about you; but I think the finite level of fun one could have in their 20s due to limited funds and leads to that kind of life comes no where near the fun one could have in their mid 30s-60s (if staying in good shape) if they invested in their future. Life really isn’t all that short. It’s just that people confuse “life” with the good things in life. Yes, the list of those moments tend to be short for most of us. That list usually tends to get longer for those who make sacrifices though.

I feel that the belief of “life being too short” needs to be phased out. The only people that can live that way and face little to no repercussions are the wealthy and even then it’s not sustainable. Life expectancy isn’t what it used to be decades ago. With perpetual advances in health and science it wouldn’t be so far fetched to say that people currently in their early 20s can see ages of 90-110 with significantly reduced age related complications."

Disclaimer that I am NOT a financial advisor, and I do not work in finance.  I'm just a guy who has made some big financial mistakes in his life and is passing on the same knowledge that my kids will receive.**

Most employers offer a 401k or Roth 401k plan as part of their benefits package.  Some of them will also match what you put into it.  I'll use my company as an example:  I am allowed to contribute money out of my paycheck (deductions are set up annually and happen automatically every pay period) into either a ""traditional"" 401k plan, or a Roth 401k plan.  I'll explain the difference between the two in a minute, but for now, focus on the pay period deductions.  An employer will typically ""match"" your contributions up to a certain percentage.  For my employer, that percentage is 5%.

This means that if I contribute 5% of my paycheck to my 401k plan, my employer will also kick in 5%.  This is free money that I am not obligated to pay back.  Most employers will have a stipulation that you have to work there for 6-12 months before they contribution kicks in, but once it does, that money is yours forever, even if you leave the company and go work somewhere else.  This means you are highly incentivized to put in at least what the company will match so that you are receiving the maximum benefit from them.  In my world, I put in 10% of my pay, but my company maxes out at 5% match, so they don't put in 10% to match me, they put in 5%, but I'm still getting that 5% for free, so in real world dollars, I'm saving/investing 15% of my yearly salary.  This also works the other way down, meaning if the company maxes their match at 5%, but you decide to only put in 3% of your pay, the company will also only put in 3% to match you.  They will only match you up to the max of 5% or whatever their maximum match rate is.  Some companies match up to 3%, some go as high as 10%.  It's a huge benefit that a lot of people don't consider and don't take advantage of.

The difference between traditional 401k and Roth comes down to taxes.  Traditional 401k is funded with pre-tax dollars, and you pay taxes on the growth once you start withdrawing money from the account.  This means that if you make $50k a year and you choose to contribute 5% of your pay to your 401k, then exactly $2,500 a year will get contributed to your account.  This makes it a little easier on you today, because money withdrawn before taxes is seldom noticed.  The Roth is funded with after tax dollars, so a 5% contribution on a $50k salary would be less than $2,500, it would end up being 5% of whatever your net pay is after taxes and other deductions are taken out of your pay.  The benefit of a Roth though is that the money invested grows tax free, and you get to withdraw it without penalty when you retire, so if you have $2M saved, you actually get to keep all of it, whereas $2M in a traditional 401k would get taxed at the future tax rate, and you would only realize $1.5M or so (depending on tax rate and withdrawal rate).

In the end, it really doesn't matter a lot which retirement plan you pick, it only matters that you fund it as hard as you can for as long as you can, and never touch it until you are eligible.  It is possible to take out loans and early withdrawals from 401k plans, but there are hefty fees and taxes for doing so, which essentially negate all of your gains.  If you find yourself in the future needing to cut down on contributions, you can do so at any time, even down to 0%, but remember that doing so also cuts into your future compounding interest, and you will need to play catch up like me.  I'm currently putting 10% of my pay (plus 5% from employer match) into a traditional 401k, plus I have a Roth that I fund separately with extra money and bonuses.

**EDIT:**

**I have gotten a lot of comments and messages about this post, so I'll add more information here to try and save other people time.**

**1) What is compound interest and how are you getting it?**

Compound interest is pretty much just the annual growth of your money that compounds on itself.  Fund values are driven by the underlying stocks that they own, and as a general rule, stocks go up in value every year (barring a black swan event like COVID or the 2008 crash).  If you are constantly buying into something that grows at a 7-10% rate every year, your account grows from both the value gained (the 7-10%) and the extra money you are putting in.  The next year's growth then benefits from both of these, so the 7-10% in year 2 grows your account by a larger amount than year 1 did.  This compounds every year and over 30-40 years, it starts to get really insane.  This is why I made the statement ""at around 500k, compound interest kicks your account in the balls.""  What I meant was, just from interest alone, year over year, your account will grow by roughly $30,000.  There are a lot of compound interest calculators out there that can show you your potential gains if you input the dollar amounts and interest/growth rates.  I use 7% for a fairly conservative planning model.

**2) Your suggestion of a Large Cap Growth Fund is garbage, everyone knows that (insert any other fund except bonds here) outperforms Large Cap!**

I honestly don't care what fund you pick, it is your decision to make.  I gave OP the suggestion of Large Cap Growth because his original question was what would you do retrospectively.  I obviously have the benefit of hindsight, but he asked to not use that, so I picked Large Cap Growth because that type of fund has made me more money in the last 10 years than any other.  Can you make just as much or more investing in International, Small Cap Growth, Large Cap Value, Small Cap Value, etc.?  Sure, you can.  I've stated this multiple times in the comments below, but it doesn't really matter what fund you pick, what matters is that you regularly contribute to it and never touch it until you retire.  Picking one fund over another is NOT going to be a million dollar mistake.  Not picking anything, however, is.

**3) Experiences are all that matters, and you can't really save that much money in your 20s anyway.**

I agree that experiences matter.  In my 20s, I didn't travel or do anything crazy, I just spent my money on food, booze, hanging out with friends, cars, motorcycles, etc.  I did have fun, but if I would have saved at least a little bit of money every month, and invested it, I would be in a much better position today.  Saving just $200 a month from 20-30 would have net me around $35k conservatively, and while that isn't a huge pile of money, that $35k grows with the rest of my account over the next 30 years from 30-60 and becomes very substantial.  I was never arguing the point that OP should save every dime and never go out or take vacations, I said save as much as you can as often as you can.  For some people, that might be $100 a month, for others that might be $100 a year.  Just get started and get in the habit of putting money away and not touching it.  Don't spend everything you make.

**4) Roth IRA is better.  No Traditional is betta!**

Again, it doesn't really matter.  What matters is putting money in one or both and don't touch it.  We can speculate all day on tax implications today vs. 30-40 years from now, but we'll never know everyone's situation.  If your employer only offers Roth IRA matches, then obviously pick that so you can take their match.  If they only offer Traditional, there you go.  If they offer both, then just pick one and run with it.  There isn't a wrong answer, and if you're that worried about it, pick both and contribute as much as you can to both.  


**5) Can you provide some examples of Large Cap Growth Funds?**

You can go to Fidelity's website (or any other brokerage that you prefer) and pretty easily research mutual funds.  There are hundreds of Funds out there, so don't worry about picking an exact one or the same one I use or whatever.  Look at the rating the Fund has received, it's returns over 1Y, 5Y, 10Y, etc. the risk profile, and any other information that is important to you.  There are a lot of funds out there nowadays that are commission free, but some still charge a small yearly fee for management.  I'm more concerned about overall performance, so I typically don't pay much attention to the fees, but again, it depends on what is important to you.  If you aren't sure what you are looking at, start googling the terms.  Some people have also argued that you should just put your money in SPY or VOO.  Again, it doesn't really matter what you pick, what matters is putting money into it regularly and not touching it for 30-40 years.

I'm happy to answer more questions, and if I get the same ones over and over, I'll add them here."
2021-04-06 15:51:42,stocks,"To add on to what others have said, if you get an employer who does match retirement contributions, be sure to set it up as soon as possible. I signed up for 6% contributions my first week of working for my current employer, and they match 5%. I have never seen my paycheck without that 6% already taken out, so I budget for everything else with that 6% already out of the equation. A few months later, I now have $2K in that account and haven't missed a penny of it, as I never had it in the first place."

Regardless, this may not be an option for you at this time, but if it is take advantage of it! It is basically a 3% raise! (or whatever the match is for the specific company's program)"

2021-04-06 16:28:24,stocks,You can save money and enjoy your youth. They aren't interchangable. You can live your college years off ramen and cheap beer and have the time of your life.
2021-04-06 15:58:57,stocks,"You can do both. Understanding where limits are is important. I advised my son who's getting ready for college in the fall that when he graduates and moves into his first real job that he needs to determine what is a comfortable amount from his wage to live on. The rest is pushed into investments. If after taxes he brings home 3k per month but he only needs 2k to live on and be comfortable then that 1k can make a huge difference for him down the road. When I was 27 I was making 80k per year while my friends were making 40. If I had put myself on a similar salary to my friends, I would have been on the same playing field as them but been banking the other half of my salary. I didn't do that and instead wanted to be a ""baller"". I'm paying for that now."

2021-04-06 18:13:08,stocks,"Yeah, but you could also party so hard that you don't stop when its appropriate, and now you're the semi brain damaged middle aged man who works for minimum wage, because he just coasted most of his life.  

This has happened to probably 35% of my older friend group, and is currently happening to a lot of my friends who are my age. This was also my experience to a lesser extent. (I'm in my late twenties but still am catching up to where my friends who partied too but also took life seriously a lot sooner. 


My advice is party when young, but know when to give up and start thinking about real life. Also don't spend alllll your money on booze and other shit, at the very least your robbing your self of other experiences you could have been spending it on (think investmemts, plane tickets, road trips, concert tickets, etc)"
2021-04-06 18:44:58,stocks,"That being said, you can party pretty hard without spending too much money. This is really good advice if you want to make it into or past middle management, people skills will win out over technical every time."
2021-04-06 17:26:06,stocks,"I’m biased toward Fidelity because I’ve been using them for years, but you can go to their website and start researching the funds they provide. Growth funds are typically US stock heavy, and also tech heavy, though the goal of the fund is typically to focus on companies that have high growth potential, so there will be other companies in there besides just tech. FDGRX is the one I have the most money invested in, and although it is currently closed to new investors, you can look it up to see what it has in it."

2021-04-06 19:58:09,stocks,That’s great diversification but if you’ve got decades ahead of you I’d say you should up the risk with a small cap value fund.
2021-04-06 17:47:18,stocks,"Just being conscious about your finances is already miles ahead of where I was at 19.  I had about $10k in credit card debt in my early 20s, along with car debt, and zero savings or investments.  I think the smartest think a person your age can do is learn how to develop a budget and live by it.  You should obviously budget for your bills, but also budget in savings for emergencies, vacations, and investments.  A lot of people are commenting that you should have fun when you are young, and I agree, but you can make that argument whether you are 18 or 38...at 38 people instead say “I DESERVE a vacation.”  If you learn how to budget and make sure you are in control of your money, you can go on vacations, spend money on clothes, eat at restaurants, and save money at the same time. It’s about moderation and self control."
2021-04-06 17:49:45,stocks,"If you are happy with the performance of the fund, it should be fine, the most important thing is just to invest money, it typically doesn’t matter which fund you pick, unless it’s all bonds or something with very low yearly returns.  For planning purposes, I forecast 6-7% returns per year, but my Fidelity funds beat that every year so far."
2021-04-06 17:54:23,stocks,"I’m not familiar with SPXL, but I mentioned growth funds because they typically look for stocks/companies that have the most room for growth, which is a good investment strategy for someone young who has a lot of years to survive dips.  You can invest in any fund you want, and at the end of the day, if my fund made 15% yearly returns and yours made 12%, we are still both millionaires because we invested money 30 years ago and enjoyed the magical entity called compound interest."
2021-04-06 18:04:11,stocks,"As a general rule, I don’t like target datefunds.  In my experience (which is admittedly limited) they always underperform.  I have most of my money at Fidelity invested in FDGRX, which is closed to new investors, but I also have an account that has FOCPX, which is very similar.  You don’t have to invest in high cap growth, I suggested it earlier based on the persons age.  I will probably start moving my money out of growth funds when I turn 50 or 55 and start putting it into lower risk funds (but this also means lower potential returns)."
2021-04-06 18:10:43,stocks,"I have FDGRX and FOCPX, but I would encourage you to research the different funds on their website and pick one that aligns with your investment strategy.  Growth funds typically are very tech heavy, so if you don’t like tech stocks, you might want to pick a fund that focuses on value stocks or international or whatever."
2021-04-06 18:16:38,stocks,"A fund that focusing on high market cap growth stocks/companies like tech (Apple, Tesla, Google, etc)."
2021-04-06 18:20:46,stocks,"The regret is that I didn’t invest. I didn’t save either, but just saving money without investing it, unless there is a short term plan for that money, is also a waste.  Just participating in a 401k from age 20-60 is a virtual guarantee to be a millionaire, it doesn’t really matter what fund or funds you pick as your investment, it matters that you are putting money away that gains compounding interest."
2021-04-06 18:34:07,stocks,"Yes, both of those are examples of large cap growth funds.  I’ll caveat again that I only suggested large cap growth based on OP’s age, since large cap growth funds are focused on large cap growth companies which typically means they are very tech heavy.  A 50 year old investor would probably not want that much risk, and might only want a portion of their portfolio in large cap growth, to better hedge against a tech downturn.  At 18, those concerns are pretty irrelevant."
2021-04-06 18:35:26,stocks,"I like FOCPX, but I would recommend researching funds on the website and deciding what fits your investment strategy best."
2021-04-06 18:38:53,stocks,"Essentially, yes.  It’s better if you do so via your companies 401k plan so you get the benefit of their match, but the idea behind investing for your future (retirement) means putting money into a fund or funds, and constantly adding to it but never withdrawing, at least not until you are retiring.  The benefit of this is compounding interest over a long period of time, plus the additional deposits you are putting in.  It’s a 30 year savings account that you keep dumping money into and never have to manage it."
2021-04-06 18:46:15,stocks,"Here’s some examples from Fidelity’s website.

You can play around with the filters and include or exclude criteria that matters to you.  In the end, it doesn’t matter as much what you pick, it just matters that you pick something and put money into it on a regular basis and don’t withdraw until retirement."
2021-04-06 18:56:57,stocks,"I’m not a financial advisor, just someone who does a ton of research for my own benefit, so I’ll start by saying that 1M is enough money that you should probably reach out to a financial professional.  That being said, I would not be happy with 4% returns (is that yearly?). I would aim for 5% minimum, and 10% as an average, depending on what your risk tolerance is.  It sounds like it is invested in very conservative funds or ETFs."
2021-04-06 18:57:36,stocks,My wife wouldn’t approve of that.

2021-04-06 19:34:57,stocks,"Counterpoint, you can educate and set your kids up financially for life and have a hell of a retirement at the same time.  I never met anyone who had a great time paying bills they are constantly behind on."

2021-04-06 16:50:20,stocks,"Obviously, a person dependent, but if we’re talking about a 19 that is actively getting skills (college education/technical school) I would disagree. Spend now, save later. If you believe your income will be substantially higher when you’re 24 don’t save now.

Reduce your debt or live a little. Why save at 19 when you work at the local coffee shop and get $11/hour working 25 hours a week when you can go on spring break and put off saving for when you’re 23 and have a full-time job making $20+ per hour.

EDIT: Someone working part-time making $16,000 a year in college who can reasonably expect a [300% increase in income](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/pay-salary/average-salary-for-college-graduates#:~:text=While%20there%20are%20a%20few,Employers%20(NACE)%20salary%20survey) when they have a degree and work full time in four years won't be too sad about missing out on 8% annual gains.  Just reduce the debt you take out, get a degree that is actually worth something, and worry about saving when you're a full-time professional, not when you're a full-time student. We're talking about delaying savings for 4 years until the individual moves from the unskilled to skilled labor wage brackets, not abandoning employer-matched 401ks until they're 55."

2021-04-06 17:13:01,stocks,"> I just have a small satellite portfolio of individual stocks, more for the fun of trading rather than making money.

I'd argue that this isn't necessarily a bad strategy; think about investing with a 40-50 year outlook from a bit of a venture capital perspective. You can make a number (10 maybe 15) of relatively small investments, and even if most of them fail, you can still come out way ahead because just one of them provided 100x return. 

Disclosure: I got lucky investing in 1-2 speculative stocks way back in the day along with a bunch of ""losers"" and this is just my way of putting that in perspective (or it's a coping mechanism for being just another stupid investor), and not investment advice."

2021-04-06 19:05:11,stocks,"If you look at the entire history of the S&P, there were only 13 years where it wasn't setting new all-time highs.  There's a saying that time in the market beats timing the market.  You really have no idea when the next correction will be, and it might not even correct to the level its at now.  I mean, SPY could grow to 500 in a year, then correct to 450 and you'll wish you had bought in at 400 (now).

You could look at the Mar 2020 crash and see that it erased 3 years of gains in a month.  Then recovered in 4 months and is off to new ATHs. If you're talking about investing from age 18 to age 65, that's a blip on the radar.

There are all kinds of strategies you can employ to hedge against a crash as well, like using a stop loss or trailing stop loss to move to cash when your target is hit."
2021-04-06 18:23:17,stocks,"If you're asking me, no.  ETFs \*are\* mutual funds that can be traded like stocks.  Since they are usually commission-free and have no minimum investment amount, they are more accessible to the retail investor.  Transactions into/out of mutual funds typically come with larger fees and there may be large minimum purchase amounts for funds that you are interested in.  In browsing, I've seen as high as $250,000 minimum investment but I'm sure they go higher.

Unless someone can correct me, I don't see any particular advantage to a mutual fund over an ETF that holds the same investments."
2021-04-06 17:18:25,stocks,"I personally hate target date funds.  I've had these offered in various employers' 401k plans and they always seem very conservative and underperforming.  If you are very risk-averse, they are fine, but I believe that the overall market will outperform target-date funds."
2021-04-06 18:35:02,stocks,"It depends on your current income, tax bracket, and what you foresee as your income/tax bracket in retirement.  If you think you'll have a lower effective tax rate in retirement, then traditional fares better.  If you think you'll have a lower tax rate now (ie: because your income is still low, or you have a lot of ~~tax credit machines~~ kids at home) then it makes more sense to use ROTH.

Also, ROTH allows you to withdraw your contributions before retirement so it's more flexible than traditional.

HOWEVER, the contributions to a ROTH are not tax-deductible and there are income restrictions on contributing to a ROTH, so it's not suitable for high-income earners."
2021-04-06 18:30:34,stocks,"Yes. An IRA is an Individual Retirement Account.  A 401(k) is also a retirement account, but it is an employer-sponsored account.   These have specific tax advantages, such as using pre-tax income to fund them and allowing the funds to grow tax-free until you withdraw at retirement.  401(k) may also have an employer match, where the employer also contributes to your retirement account ie: if you put in 3% of your income, they put in 3% of your income as well. It is highly recommended to max out the match percentage on your 401(k) contributions, as this is basically ""free"" money.   401(k)s have more or less replaced pensions in the US workforce. 

A 401(k) is managed by the administrator of your workplace's choice and typically has a limited selection of available investments. Usually an IRA is something you manage yourself or through a broker, completely independent of your job, and has much more options as far as investment choices.

Both 401(k) and IRA can be had in a ""ROTH"" type, where the money contributed is actually post-income tax and the gains in the account are then tax free upon withdrawal.  Basically, you pre-pay the taxes on your retirement.  

There are a lot of specific rules around each account type that are worth researching.  Tax considerations, contribution limits, income exemptions, etc."
2021-04-06 18:55:49,stocks,"They overlap a lot, so you don't gain much diversity by splitting them up.  Conversely, VTI might be \*too\* diverse to be your only pick as it covers literally everything, and winds up underperforming as a result.

I personally would pick VOO or SPY, or whatever S&P 500 fund you like as the top pick, and you'd be fine with just that.  But if you want more exposure outside the S&P, add in some VTI.  QQQ is great if you want a tech-heavy pick, but you can see the downside to doing that if you look at the charts for March where the Qs took a beating. And as mentioned elsewhere, DIA/Dow Jones is a very large-cap weighted index, so if you want large cap/mega cap/blue chips then that's a good pick for that particular sector."
2021-04-06 19:39:26,stocks,"Lower expense ratio.

SPY is better for options though, so much more liquidity.  That's where all the action is."
2021-04-06 19:38:29,stocks,"Since they more or less track the whole market, yes. 

What you get with an index fund is aggregate growth and risk. You eliminate the individual firm risk and the sector risk, and just get the overall risk of the market as a whole.

If you look at say, March 2020, the S&P lost 3 years of growth in a month. Then it made it all back in 4 months and we're setting new all time highs again in August. Long term, 20-30 years, that's a blip on the radar.  There are also strategies you can employ that reduce that risk even further using options, stop losses, trailing stops, etc."

I wish I was contributing more to my retirement when I was younger but I try not to have any regrets.  What is the point of that?"
2021-04-06 17:36:19,stocks,"Tldr: Life isn’t as short as people say (and it’s only getting longer). You can sacrifice some of your youth to see a compounded return on fun via investing in yourself but still have fun while doing so. Fun in your 20s is overrated due to having little funds. Having fun with good money in your 30s (and beyond) is more valuable. You will realize this when you see others that took the other path and thank yourself.

Honestly, I think fun is pretty overrated when we are young. If you save and invest your money you are also investing in future fun. Just like money, fun can be saved and it can grow like compound interest. When I started college I had lots of family/friends that would tell me that I wasn’t living life and that it’s too short to always be studying. Jokes on them. 3 years later I got accepted to a graduate program to become a medical professional. I graduate in 3 more years and if blessed with the opportunity to specialize maybe another 2-4 years more in the form of a paid residency. 

I will probably end up with nearly 200k in debt after these 3 years. If I continue to invest and save the money my parents send to help with food, transportation, etc; I could probably knock off a solid 30-40% of that debt. Maybe even more if you take into consideration resident salary. Instead I’ll just pay the interest off, invest the rest, and start working. 

When I start after the next 5-7 years, in the field of my desired specialty, I can expect to make a 250-450k a year starting out. So after exactly 1 year, after taxes, I already have the ability to pay off that loan and have some money left over. At this point I am still under 30 years of age. 

Before that following year I could get a loan to start my own practice. Sure, it’ll probably take a year before I manage to turn a profit. But once I do, it will be 500k-800k in pure profits every year. 

I want to add that I didn’t take into my girlfriend being on her way to doing the same. We’re pretty set on getting married and starting a joint practice that will raise profits approximately 25-30%. By the time she’s done and joins me I will still not have reached 35. Most of those friends I mentioned earlier barely continued education after high school and are either in and out of jails or working harsh dead-end jobs. Due to this, they couldn’t marry or find someone with an education that got them a good paying job. In fact, most of them are stay at home moms or they they are paying child support.

Now idk about you; but I think the finite level of fun one could have in their 20s due to limited funds and leads to that kind of life comes no where near the fun one could have in their mid 30s-60s (if staying in good shape) if they invested in their future. Life really isn’t all that short. It’s just that people confuse “life” with the good things in life. Yes, the list of those moments tend to be short for most of us. That list usually tends to get longer for those who make sacrifices though. 

I feel that the belief of “life being too short” needs to be phased out. The only people that can live that way and face little to no repercussions are the wealthy and even then it’s not sustainable. Life expectancy isn’t what it used to be decades ago. With perpetual advances in health and science it wouldn’t be so far fetched to say that people currently in their early 20s can see ages of 90-110 with significantly reduced age related complications."

2021-04-06 18:08:42,stocks,"On the other hand (speaking as a Canadian, it's possible the US does it differently) the government will not charge interest on student loans while you're in school, and may give you substantially more than you need if you just give them honest assessment of your finances. If you're going into school with some serious loans, try living as frugally as you can without seriously impacting how much fun you're having, and extrapolate forward how much of your loan you're going to need. For me there was a good $5k I never touched from the start of my undergrad through to the end of my PhD. Putting that money into *safe* investments like broad ETFs is usually better than being paranoid and holding it in a savings account when you're still young and have people who will bail you out in emergency situations. This goes double for when your debt is not collecting interest but an investment could be. You're basically getting extra money from your loan that you never have to pay back."

There's no guarantee our health will maintain even with the right foods and consistent exercise. More likely yes but no guarantee. Those expected advances in anti-aging have been expected for a loooong time and we don't know how close or far we really are from a goal of reversing or stopping aging.

Your raw physical ability is almost guaranteed to decline as well. The exception might be if you're not exercising at all in your 20s and then get super committed to fitness later on.

2021-04-06 19:55:27,stocks,"Your money grows due to the value of the fund increasing, yes, and sometimes that does include dividends from the underlying stocks.  As each underlying stock that the fund owns rises in value, so does the fund value, and this your investment.  If you put $10k into a fund and then never touch it again, meaning no more deposits, your $10k will grow yearly due to the value of the underlying stocks growing.  If they grow annually by 10%, then you would have $11,000 after year 1, then $12,100 in year 2, then $13,310 in year 3, etc.  This is called compound interest, and it occurs because you are not taking value m/gains out of the account every year, you are reinvesting the profits by not touching it."

Most people who think they can beat the market, or think it is easy, have not beaten an index over 20-30 years. They just think they can because they beat it once or twice in recent years. 

But beating an index any time between 2009-2021 does not count, as it is one of the best bull runs in history. It has been easy to beat an index over a few years by picking the right stocks or funds. If you can beat the average return from 2009-2030, that might be notable though."

Let me push back on that a bit; I'd argue that a lot of kids don't know what they want as a career at 17/18, and that is fine. I'd further argue that in many cases, people's careers don't really follow the route that they planned at the college selection stage.

2021-04-06 12:32:06,stocks,Funny thing is the big oil companies have major stakes in renewable energy. They are kinda like the big cable version of streaming where Cable might be dying however they had the forethought to be the ISP providers.

2021-04-06 15:34:38,stocks,I’m currently loading up on $RIG 1/2023 calls. I’m hoping for a major recovery in demand and higher oil prices in the next 6 to 12 months. Calls are fairly cheap and I think this trade has tremendous upside.
2021-04-06 17:55:30,stocks,"Yep, oil is still a recovery play, and green energy will definitely be subsidized, but wont be able to grow at a fast enough rate to kill oils growth, plus all the petroleum products made for other uses. 

Also, these companies have the infrastructure and capital to move in on the green energy turf. Bullish long run."
2021-04-06 13:04:37,stocks,Yes significantly overweight - I expect a significant imbalance between supply and demand. When you combine capital spending slashed during covid with natural well declines it appear as if demand could very well ramp back up as we return to normal at the perfect time.

2021-04-06 16:15:39,stocks,"No stake in the game yet, but here's my take;  


Oil isn't going anywhere, you should exploit any and all resources and any country dumb enough to pull a Dumbyfornia will suffer greatly for it. Ya, sure, EVs and renewables can be as cool and flashy as they want to be but there's a lot of areas where certain renewables just make no sense. Good example is here in Ohio, wind works for the most part but solar is probably the worst thing to do and the carbon footprint is positive if you tried to roll out solar as the main renewable here.   


Exploit your resources, but exploit them wisely.  


side note: Why is the west the only one's hyper focused on EVs and what not? Everywhere else legit just wants our money and doesn't care about anything else."
2021-04-06 14:44:14,stocks,"Short term, no. Long term I think the ones who start the pivot to renewable now will have a slight edge because of the already available network and infrastructure they have access to. Imo it'll be like the race to get online and the ones who don't participate will end up like Sears."
2021-04-06 14:52:58,stocks,"no, but natural gas yes. high dividends like oke are attractive to me because natural gas is so stable and easy to produce. theyre trying to phase out gas for cars, so long time i feel like itll be worth less.  not worth nothing, just less."
2021-04-06 14:02:05,stocks,"I think the transition between oil to electric or nuclear is going to take a long time. Because for example you can have EV a vehicles but producing electricity requires oil. And a lot of the military type corps need oil to run their jets, planes, boats, tanks etc. there will be a need, I’m not sure what the impact of the automobile industry downsizing but also some EV vehicles are not ideal in certain weather conditions. 

Again I’m just thinking out loud, I don’t want to say oil will never be needed, because we have to remember they are working hard lobbying and so there will be resistance to move off it. So I would say oil will very much still be relevant in the next 10 years but after that maybe we need to re-asses."

2021-04-06 12:39:16,stocks,Any thoughts as to why? It's a finite resource that will eventually be depleted so yes renewables will win long term but the years leading up to the total depletion will be astronomical IMO.

In the meantime I can see them either producing their own or contracting with big name companies already in existence. Nonetheless, if these companies want to survive they have to phase out oil and phase in renewable, and the government goes hand in hand with corporate prosperity, so I think you may see it happening in your lifetime."

Take it for what it is but it can certainly go down, by just regular market forces. This excludes governmental and social forces as well.

What matters is prices moving forward, there will always be profit to be had, but the price/demand points are going to be interesting. If demand goes down but price go up you might get more gluts as people try to rush out supply - and Shale is GREAT at glutting up supply."

Because timing was in my favor, those decisions benefited me, but starting about a month ago I've gone back to simply adding to those funds as I don't feel confident in picking stocks, short of those that are in spaces that I know a lot about the industry (healthcare) and opening small positions in moon shots. I do have a portfolio of about 100 positions and it's outperforming my 401k substantially, which I started around 2017, but that was purely due to timing during the crash and having capital to invest, also getting lucky with rotating from bonds to stocks. I've learned that outside of black swan events I probably can't beat the market so I'm going to DCA and grow my cash balance, which is pretty much zero as I'm fully invested aside from 6-10 months living expenses."

Can anyone break it down Barney style for me ? TIA"
2021-04-06 10:58:51,stocks,"Share price is all determined on the supply & demand of shares for a specific stock.

When something causes demand to increase, such as good news, the share price will increase too. Vice versa, when less traders are interested, demand decreases, share price decreases too.

There are two types of positions in the market - long & short. Long positions are entered by buying stock, whilst short positions are entered by selling stock. If more people want to long instead of short, the price increases. More people want to short than long, price decreases. 

Selling a stock at a high price first is called short-selling; it’s when you expect the stock to go down. But how do you get these shares to sell first, if you don’t own any? In summary, you borrow shares from your broker and sell them on the market. When you want to exit a trade, you buy back those shares. If you sold high and bought low, congrats, you made some profit. Sell low and buy high = loss. 

To earn money in the market, it’s always buy low, sell high (which can be done in any order). You can research more of it 👍"
2021-04-06 11:11:09,stocks,"The whole market is one big auction.  It happens fast with big stocks, but if you look at little stocks with less trading going on, it slows down and you can see it.  You have people willing to buy at a certain price, and people willing to see at a certain price.  For example, you might see:

Last: $3.24
1500  3.24 x 3.26  750

This means there are 1,500 shares bid (willing to buy) at $3.24, and 750 shares asked (willing to sell) at $3.26.  If nobody budges, the share price stays the same.  But, if you enter a market order to buy 200 shares, it’ll hit the “ask” at $3.26.  The ask volume will drop from 750 shares to 550 shares.  The new market will be:

Last: $3.26
1500  3.24 x 3.26  550

...and so on.  That’s a stock sale (or purchase, because every trade is a buy and a sell).  The movement of that auction is what makes stocks go up and down.  Does that make sense?"
2021-04-06 11:52:21,stocks,"Question. I understand how you make money shorting a stock. You explained it well. But where did that value difference come from? The broker must not be losing money in the process or they wouldn't allow it. Or is it just coming from the lost equity of whoever bought the initial short sale? And then it's separately up to that person to hold and hope to gain equity back or sell for loss?

I think I answered my own question lol."
2021-04-06 12:39:22,stocks,"Short sale means infinite loss, because when the stock price increases, you lose more and more (and there is no limit as to how high it can reach, compared to $0 if the stock crashes downwards).

The client will always take the loss. When you short sale, you will always owe the broker the shares until you buy them back later and return them. They don’t care if you lose/gain; all they want is their shares, lol."

If you're new to this, then your best bet is to make a monthly contribution into a basket of ETF's. 

If you're hell-bent on purchasing individual company stock, then you need to decide on a strategy. Are you looking for growth stocks or dividend stocks, or both? Is there a particular sector you're looking to get involved in? How about a particular geographic region?

In terms of diversification: If you buy two stocks from the same industry that operate in the same region and are subject to the same risks, you aren't really that diversified. 

DD is a time-consuming exercise. I don't know if you have any background knowledge on this, but I usually recommend people to pick up a basic understanding of financial accounting because DD requires you to be able to at least tell the difference between an income statement and a balance sheet. Any basic accounting textbook will do, and it isn't difficult, just something I highly recommend doing. 

After that, you may want to read books like ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham, or some other ""How to buy stocks"" type of book. 

Penny stocks can pay off, but most do not. When it comes to OTC, they're not subject to the same regulatory requirements on things like filings and transparency as companies that are listed on e.g. the NYSE.

It's very difficult for anyone to tell you what companies to look into, especially before knowing exactly what you're looking for. I would, however, caution against taking any advice from Reddit without doing your own homework, and as much as I like wallstreetbets, I would caution against investing into companies like GME before you yourself have developed a well-informed investment thesis for it. 

I usually look for companies that are somewhat overlooked and do my best to stay away from hype/meme stocks, although I sometimes might buy into them. I look for companies that have little to no debt, have a proven track record or are turning themselves around and which have a clear plan for future returns of shareholder value."

2021-04-06 10:21:01,stocks,"its called iv crush, generally happens after an earnings move is less than expected move

let's take TSLA since they have a high iv. earnings is tomorrow (it isn't actually) and tsla is at 700. the market doesn't know if tsla is mooning or dumping but everyone is excited to guess the outcome. as a result, the iv is inflated because everyone expects tsla to have a massive movement. the expected move is 100 bucks. in reality, tsla moves only 1 dollar after hours. the next day, calls and puts will both be gutted because iv will dramatically decrease since the outcome is now revealed and the movement was minimal."

2021-04-06 13:52:36,stocks,"Put options are roughly priced as:

Strike price - underlying asset + implied volatility x time

Call options are similarly:

Underlying asset price - strike price + implied volatility x time

If things become less volatile or if the amount of time til expiration decreases, both calls and puts lose value. This actually happens every day to all options, only there are large enough changes in the underlying asset to mask it. When a stock is up and you see that the price of calls are up and the price of puts are down, you don’t really question it. However, both sets of options have lost money due to the decrease in time to expiration, also known as theta decay."

So to start of my highest conviction stocks has to be Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook, Amazon, Google and Unilever
Here's why I like these in short

So I like Berkshire Hathaway because of warren buffet and Charlie munger but also this is a diversified business and it's growing YoY.
Google and Facebook are one of the best in the world the advertising business is growing strong every year and there's no sign this will stop also they are entering other industrys
With Amazon it's another beast who's entering other industries all the time there cloud computing is growing strong and there advertising business are also growing.
With Unilever I like this because over 2 billion people use their products every day and it's growing in emarging markets.


I do have some high conviction funds eswell iam from the UK so most of you guys won't recognise these but you can reasherch them. So to start off my high conviction funds and trusts are Smithson investment trust, fundsmith equity, lindsel train global equity, Finsbury growth and income, Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust.

Here's why I like these funds and why you should reasherch them
So with fundsmith equity it's ran by Terry Smith who's a legendary British Investor from 2003 to now he's averaged around 15% returns and what's even more impressive from 2003 to 2013 in the ""lost decade"" he averaged 14% return every year.
He also gets a say in the Smithson investment trust but he doesn't run it everyday and Terry also gets compared to warren buffet.
With the lindsell train global equity and Finsbury growth and income they are both ran buy another legendary investor named nick train. He is a expert in the UK markets both his funds are diversified with exposure to Japan UK and USA.
Finally to Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust. So these trust are similar to arkk funds and their parent company who controls the fund baillie Gifford were also at one point before the pandemic the second largest shareholder of Tesla just behind Elon musk they have sold some of Their stake after the impressive run up. The main reason I hold these trusts is because of the private company exposure

Some honourable mentions are visa Mastercard and Adobe and Microsoft. I like them but won't buy them because of their valuations

So what are your highest conviction stocks and why ?"

Just my $0.02 but I think if society continues to trend towards cashless commerce and more corporations push into digital currencies and payment systems, the potential for companies that deal with money and payment will be huge.

 - That isn't *unusually* high for tech.    
 - TSM's capx is incredibly high, they're in a growth phase (next generation of market dominating fabrication plants).    
 - TSM's market moats are so wide they *own* the market until 2025~ (and likely well beyond). They're essentially a giant monopoly for their sector (and what do monopolies do? Pump profits).      
 - The chip shortage/insane demand doesn't print immediately due to existing contracts/sold fab slots lasting years. But when they re-up, profits are going to shoot up too.   
 - These stories about countries/competitors looking to compete have to be taken in the context of *timeline*. To compete with TSM's market position *right now* will take 5+ years, to compete with what TSM is currently building we're talking 10+ years.

Unfortunately, they are attempting to double Magic's revenue in the next five years, and, I believe, they are in danger of killing the golden goose. They are printing so many new 'collectible' sets, while cutting out their LGS network, and raising prices on those products. While this will probably be good for them in the short or medium term, it also looks a lot like what comic books did in the mid 90s that nearly killed them."

2021-04-06 17:27:51,stocks,"Yeah that sounds like a misstep for sure. They should be trying to attract new players, not milk the existing ones to the point of no return.
I think a major problem with Magic is just how expensive the hobby is. I’m hoping their digital version of the game will help mitigate this and allow younger players to join without the price point of physical cards.

I’m kind of hoping they’ll cool off with oversaturating the game with new collectibles and focus on reaching new audience members through Magic Arena and stuff. If they become competitive with Hearthstone in the Asian markets that’s a huge revenue stream. 

I’m also hoping that TCG tournaments will become an even bigger spectator event. 

I guess I still think there’s a ton of room for growth but I agree that the way they’re going about it has a lot of risk. I’m confident in the company though and optimistic that they’ll pivot if they notice signs of the golden goose dying."
2021-04-06 18:43:23,stocks,Very good point and I agree. I worry about unsustainable growth
2021-04-06 14:24:11,stocks,"I can’t say for its historical PE ratio, but I’d chalk up its current high to a few things. Mainly the current volatility affecting the entire all time high market. Its valuation seems to be based on the idea that the toy industry will “recover” the same way airline, restaurant, and other industries affected by the pandemic are expected to. Additionally, some analysts are looking at the innovation and restructuring that Hasbro has been doing and evaluating based on that. 


I think investors looking at Hasbro are seeing the same type of potential I do, which sets the PE high, but my personal valuation, which is obviously a bit more speculative, would set the target price even higher. While analysts do see Hasbro’s shift in focus toward entertainment and improved digital sales, I don’t think they really understand the potential that the new focus on WotC brings. 

D&D and MtG have exploded in recent years. TTRPGs and TCGs have traditionally been thought of as a small part of the fringe Nerd Hobbyist Industry. Now both are full blown industries of their own, with their respective subcultures permeating across multiple demographics. While I don’t think the combined TTRPG/TCG industry will ever grow as large as the video game industry, I think it will follow similar growth patterns to what the video game industry has over the past 10-20 years, but in an even shorter timespan. And WotC will be at the forefront of that.

Then there’s the entertainment stuff, which I detailed in another post, obviously it’s risky to bet on a company in hopes that a few movies will be mega successful, but risk vs reward to me makes it a no brainer. Tons of IPs with projects in the works with potential to become Hasbro’s next Transformers franchise. It’s possible that current investors see that the same way I do. What I don’t think they realize is just how much synergy already exists that makes it a safer bet with even more reward: Make D&D popular and culturally relevant>Get more people to see D&D movie>More people see D&D movie>More people play D&D for the first time.

I don’t know if now is the time to invest because I think there could be another correction for the market in general. But I do believe this stock will do great long term."
2021-04-06 14:33:48,stocks,"I’m not concerned, I don’t want to spam the same, admittedly speculative DD I’ve been writing in other replies so the TLDR of why I like the stock is this:

Hasbro is shifting away from being mainly a toy company and is spending more time and money on its entertainment division and on its nerd games (D&D and Magic). These two divisions have a much higher potential for growth. All three of these divisions (toys, entertainment, nerd stuff) feed into one another. If one grows, they all grow. What makes this different from previous years is now they know what’s growing and focusing on it."

2021-04-06 19:21:53,stocks,"Most the posts I see are just meme stuff saying to hold and stuff like that. Silver isn't like GME, its market cap is over $1 trillion. It would be impossible for for retail investors to buy enough to reduce the amount of silver on the market to effect short sellers. You are basically putting your money in a volatile savings account by investing in silver. Do you have an exact percentage silver is being shorted?"
2021-04-06 13:40:31,stocks,"Yeah, the numbers reflect the downturn of the physical toy business, but I think we’re going to see the entire business transform in the next few years.

Essentially, last month Hasbro restructured so that its business has three divisions: Toys, Wizards of the Coast, and Entertainment One (media).

D&D and MtG are at the end of their “Renaissance” phase and now in the full blown growth phase. It’s no longer propped up by nostalgia from old players and vague interest from younger nerds, both games are now attracting new players who would have never thought about them before.

Their media division has so many IPs with projects in development and slated for release. D&D film, MtG show, My Little Pony film, Power Rangers film, GI Joe Snake Eyes film, etc. Obviously some of these have tried and failed before, but that was before Hasbro had its own studio and direct creative control.
This is where I think the growth is. If one of these becomes another Transformers then that is a billion dollar film franchise with multi-billion dollar merch sales, and unlike Transformers, Hasbro won’t have to share a bulk of the profits with another production company. 

If two projects turn into successful franchises then Hasbro will essentially be a mini media conglomerate with full ownership and existing supply chain for its merchandise. 

I will do a proper DD on Hasbro with numbers at some point after I do some more research and get my positions high enough to show that I’m putting my money where my mouth is."

only because BP / Shell  etc invested heavily in green energy as well, it does not make them green at all.

2021-04-06 14:32:09,stocks,"Anybody find it kind of off-putting that we have a ""meme stock"" discussion? Sounds like gatekeeping and honestly, envy.  A stock is a stock. GME should be discussed along with other ""normal stocks"" like AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, etc.

Look I get it, majority of /r/stocks users probably failed to capitalize on GME or other meme stocks in January so now most of them are salty bears who just want it to fail solely because they themselves didn't get rich off it. Hell, they had a second chance to get in again at the 40s and they failed to do so AGAIN. At the end of the day, we are in it to make money. Us ""dumb primates"" managed to profit massively from a ""dead company"" so your holier-than-thou /r/stocks redditor are jealous because their ""fundamental tech investment"" took a huge fucking shit last month while GME managed to gamma squeeze again lol."

2021-04-06 15:39:55,stocks,"I think its helpful to label them as meme stocks because you know these stocks have higher than usual volatility, and you know they are in the media. Some people are excited to buy anything labeled a meme stock and some people are excited to short anything labeled a meme stock. Knowing this, if you can find a meme stock that actually has a solid company behind it that you believe in then it presents a lot of great opportunities as a buyer. If you come in with a plan, do your DD, and at least pay attention to momentum you can get in for a great price and then just sit back while everyone else worries about their calls not printing. Meme stocks is code for opportunity imo"
2021-04-06 18:31:56,stocks,I just don't get the hate directed at those of us who like GameStop and other meme stocks. It seems like they want us to lose money. I do not understand that way of thinking at all. My hope is that we will all make money. That's the whole idea of buying stocks in the first place. Personally I just like making it fast instead of slow. I keep my long stuff but it's boring and I enjoy the volatility of the meme stocks. I take the bad days and I take the good but at least it's not boring and does not take a year to figure out whether you did good or not.
2021-04-06 17:09:19,stocks,"yes, its because we are jealous so we entered into an alliance with the ""hedgies"" to forever short GME. But then TSLA crashed to zero and i couldnt afford it anymore. Stocks only started existing during GME short squeeze so the past year didnt happened so we had no money. As the person who im sure did their DD on GME, im sure you cant imagine having a stock for years (or a few months!) just suddenly go down. Not to mention the hedgies are my wife's boyfriend so we have to get along so i went to them again. They told us to gatekeep the ""dumb primates"" (something you basically call yourselves so i dunno why its in quotes when you say it..) because they would be so insulted and feel left out to have their very own daily thread. i mean all threads exist to gatekeep the eternal victims of the hedgies. i would suggest asking the mods to end this discrimination."

2021-04-06 00:00:00,stocks,"What are your SpaceX moves? ARKX vs BPTRX vs SPCE vs GOOG vs waiting for SpaceX IPO to go public... I'm trying to figure out the best way to invest in SpaceX and I keep seeing so many varying opinions on it. (I've only been investing for less than a year, so I am still learning and looking to be educated.) I figured I'd wait until their IPO when public and then grab however many shares I could afford to lose. I own some Google and know they have about 9%, but some people are saying it's better to hold BPTRX or SPCE or ARKZ and I don't know enough about these companies to pick and choose. Or do I just chill out and wait for the SpaceX IPO and then buy whole shares? I want in on this Starlink stuff! I really appreciate you taking time to help me out."
2021-04-06 07:08:45,stocks,"There’s no way Elon takes SpaceX public anytime soon. He still has enormous risks he plans to take with the company and needs to spend money like water to take those risks. Going public just isn’t compatible with that kind of risk taking. Can you imagine SpaceX being nagged for quarterly revenues while trying to plan and execute a manned Mars mission? Ridiculous.

That said, it sounds like Starlink will IPO; and if that’s the case, I doubt it will be the only spinoff. I could see other spin-offs coming down the line for asteroid mining, space tourism, and consumer tech that SpaceX develops along the way. 

I also believe that this can be a case of rising tides lifting all boats. SpaceX’s competitors (if they can innovate) and clients all stand to benefit as space becomes cheaper and more accessible."
2021-04-06 06:50:25,stocks,So as a former employee I can tell you Musk doesn’t want to take the company public the reason why is because  if he does then he would have to answer to investors and wouldn’t be able to proceed with his plans for the company....he had said before that after he achieved his goal he may.

Regarding the tickers you mentioned:

* **BPTRX** - high expense ratio and only ~3% of the fund is SpaceX, so you'd need to invest a lot for any meaningful share of your portfolio to be SpaceX
* **SPCE** - Virgin Galactic is a joke and as far as I know they have no plans to use SpaceX to get to orbit, they have their dumb spaceplane that barely skims out of the atmosphere.
* **ARKX** - doesn't hold SpaceX and in general doesn not seem like a great space play.
* **GOOG** - a good investment, regardless of SpaceX, I see their SpaceX holding as a nice bonus."

We're talking Elon Musk and his loyal cult, the sheer hype and FOMO will make the stock moon even if it runs a massive deficit. That said I also think Elon will keep it private and only sell shares to truly rich people, those who can pay for a ticket to Mars to avoid war, pandemics, global warming...




Space X, colonising Mars will be the next America. The rich will pay for a stairway to heaven and leave ordinary people behind, the average person would just be a resource drain. Unless they tetra form the whole planet well deal with very limited resources and even less living space, meaning every acre of land will be litterary priceless. On Mars there is no government, no laws, whoever gets first makes the rules. Whoever brings weapons and mercenaries is king. Or maybe the UN decides to step in (ha!) and make sure Mars is terraformed then divided equally between all nations (as if...)"
2021-04-06 06:23:04,stocks,Why do you say they're not designed to make money? They built their reusable rockets in order to launch payloads much cheaper than anyone else out there.

2021-04-06 05:50:16,stocks,"I
Why would I not invest in SpaceX? There is no other company like it on the planet. I feel like Space is the future and it seems like it would be a smart investment. I don't have crazy money to throw at anything. I'm just trying to expand my portfolio and learn."
2021-04-06 09:36:20,stocks,"Rich people may be amongst the first to visit Mars for prestige. But like visiting Everest, they will need Sherpas. The people living and working on Mars won’t be the richest people, they’ll be risk takers with skills. 

I don’t see rich people moving to Mars to live on a barren planet, until significant infrastructure is in place first. Why would a rich person want to live in a hermetically sealed hovel with a limited selection of food, extremely limited entertainment options, and a closed economy? Rich people aren’t going to throw everything away en mass to move to Mars until there are scaled up habitats, diversification of food stuffs, cultural cornerstones, etc. Until then they’ll visit Mars like they visit Antarctica, the only people staying there will be the people building infrastructure, scientists, and frontiersmen. 

To the other point, it doesn’t matter if you think I’m wrong about the consequences of SpaceX going public. Elon Musk has no intention of taking it public anytime soon. Whether that’s because publicly traded corporations are almost fundamentally required to be risk averse or for some other combination of factors doesn’t matter. It’s not happening."

Starlink will likely be similar to a telecom or utility,  large initial capital expense, then stable largish dividends.   Starlink pays SpaceX to finance Mars, SpaceX stays private so no shareholders to pressure them to stop wasting money trying to get to Mars.   Starlink IPO to let the early investors to cash out, so SpaceX doesn't have to worry about keeping investors happy.   I pre-ordered Starlink,  and I wouldn't mind buying shares when possible,  but I expect that investment to be similar to VZ."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I understand why this is beneficial to professional investor or hedge fund. You don’t want to announce you are about to buy/sell 1000 shares of XYZ and then have everyone buy in before you. Still, I’m wondering how a fund is able to establish such a position without influencing the price that much. Are they buying and selling a relatively small number of shares over a long period? How do they make the decision on how much and when to buy shares?

2021-04-06 09:15:23,stocks,"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

For the last 4 days, the market has been on an abnormally impressive bull run. Can it keep that momentum going for a fifth day?

No. No it can't.

Here's some bad news:

* Yesterday, we hit a hard resistance line and we didn't get past it after hours.
* [Credit Suisse](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/06/investing/credit-suisse-archegos-losses/index.html) is selling off billions of dollars of stocks, which is likely to spread a little fear
* The Fed is releasing FOMC minutes tomorrow, which won't necessarily contain bad news, but always makes the market nervous
* Jerome Powell is making a speech on Thursday. As I've [previously argued](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC), that means there's a 66% chance that Thursday will be red.

I could be wrong. If the NASDAQ significantly breaks 13,714 in the morning, we'll be in for a very bullish day -- but it's much more likely that we'll be taking a breather today.

Today, I'm forecasting a **red day** with a **NASDAQ high of 13,706** and a **low of 13,600.**

So first I buy a 100 shares of whatever stock I plan to sell calls for? So lets say GME is worth $10. I buy 100 shares which is $1000.

Then I can sell a call option, where I get paid a premium. So if the premium is like $1.00. I get paid $100. The strike price is $12.

Now I wait and hopefully it expires OTM so that I can keep my premium and my shares right?

IF it does expire OTM, below the strike price at lets say $9. I understand I get to keep the premium and shares, but what do I do with the shares anyway. Since I bought 100 @$10 (totaling $1000), and they are now worth $9, it means they are worth $900 right? What now?

IF it expires ITM, I still get to keep my premium but now I HAVE to sell my shares right? Lets pretend it expired above the strike price at $13. I bought the shares 100 @ $10 and now they worth $13. My brain is getting confused at this point, but I since I bought them at $10 and now they are worth $13, does that mean I lost $300....? Please someone help"

2021-04-06 08:31:51,stocks,"I was recently suggested by my tax professional that my wife and I open up Rotha IRA's and fully fund them before the May 15th deadline. We've only had a trading account since Dec/Jan so we will need to sell off about 12k combined of VOO in a Joint Taxable account to fund both IRAs (6k each). I would love to keep the original share prices, and just fully fund the 2020 IRAs with Cash but all of my cash is tied up in other investments at the moment.

VOO's share price has gone from 346 to 373 since I purchased, and we can't roll over the shares into the Roth, so we'll have to sell at market price and rebuy VOO in the Roth IRAs.

1. If we plan to buy VOO in both the IRA's, is it better to sell the shares  
First In/Out, to capitalize on profit now (cost-share closer to $346)or  
High Cost or Last In/Out - to keep the lowest cost share in the Taxable Account, because we'll still have some shares leftover in the taxable account?
2. Once the Roth's are funded T+2, so (Thur/Fri), should I immediately use the 6k in each account to buy VOO all at once, or wait for a pullback of the ATH?

Thanks!"

2021-04-06 09:37:59,stocks,If you pay me I’ll invest for you.
2021-04-06 10:01:57,stocks,Um
2021-04-06 10:18:40,stocks,I'm also in negative on Apple. Unfortunately
2021-04-06 12:05:34,stocks,"It might depend on what your plans are for the money, but at some point it stops making sense to hold that much cash. Right now, nobody is sure how interest rates will behave this year, so I'd take that cash and put it into something like SPY to balance against your nasdaq-heavy allocation. Or buy a house if you don't already have one."

2021-04-06 12:13:45,stocks,"Like all the ARK funds, the contents of the portfolio are going to be in a constant state of change. No way to predict exactly what that fund will look like in the short or long term. It all comes down to whether or not you believe in ARK's management and their ability to make money. Personally, I don't see that sector being profitable enough to outpace the market anytime soon."
2021-04-06 12:12:48,stocks,"To me all of it's holdings seem pretty solid, but as a ""space exploration"" ETF it still confuses me. I'm going to buy a tiny bit for exposure but I'm putting more of my money in individual companies I prefer (primarily virgin galactic)."
2021-04-06 12:39:47,stocks,"cathie has said that arkx's focus is mobile connectivity and hypersonic travel/drone tech, that the companies she chose will improve these in 5 years. not necessarily 'space' 

also i'm sure some of the companies in the etf will be used as her 'cash' holdings. just like in her other etfs she is always selling something liquid to buy her actual growth disruptive picks"
2021-04-06 18:06:13,stocks,Because I sold it today.
2021-04-06 18:51:52,stocks,Looks like a bit of a squeeze
2021-04-06 08:42:03,stocks,"If they expire at $9, you have realized $100 of profit from the premium but your shares are now worth only $900. If you now sold your shares, you'd break even, but most of the time you'd hold them and just sell another covered call for the next expiration date.

If it expires ITM, you will most likely be assigned and your shares will be sold at the strike price. Thus you have made $100 from the premium and $200 from the sale for a net profit of $300. From there, you can wait for the stock to dip and buy back in, or move on to the next play."
2021-04-06 08:45:12,stocks,"The first if depends on your strategy.

The second means the buyer will in all likelyhood exercise the call, forcing you to sell them your 100 shares for $12 per, meaning you get $1200 for your shares you bought for $1000 plus the premium which you always get to keep for a total of $1300, making a $300 profit in total."
2021-04-06 09:27:41,stocks,Decreasing profit and increasing debt is a bad
2021-04-06 10:54:14,stocks,"Great stock, I am not in on it but have been lurking for roughly 1-2 months now.  I really want to buy in but dont have any funds at the moment"
2021-04-06 13:21:44,stocks,I'll believe it when it sustains its gains for more than a couple days.
2021-04-06 14:01:13,stocks,Just glancing at what my broker offers: the price is 780/contract for 7.50 Jan '23. At that price you're only getting exposure to like 30% more shares than if you bought them. You prefer that to out of the money calls?
2021-04-06 13:32:06,stocks,"I sold at 57...220% profit but im upset lol.

Holding my CZRs still though. it can hit above 100 soon"
2021-04-06 17:11:11,stocks,"I'm far from an expert on Berkshire Hathaway, but it's my understanding that they're pretty secure and diversified as a holding company. Seems like it would be fine but I think they've been underperforming the market as of late"
2021-04-06 16:43:14,stocks,$HERO is a great fund. GlobalX ETFs have very high expenses ratios though.
2021-04-06 17:09:04,stocks,I like ESPO a lot
2021-04-06 17:58:43,stocks,"For tax purposes the $1 loss on your first sale would get added to the cost basis for your second purchase, making it $16. Then when you sell at $5 the total loss of $11 would be realized as long as you don't re-purchase again within 30 days"
2021-04-06 19:54:03,stocks,"You could always have domestic politics or events that heavily affect investor psychology and cause a disproportionate sell-off in one country or the other, but Sony is heavily traded enough that I doubt it would last long or deviate much.

That kind of stuff tends to be more of a risk with lightly traded stocks like Hyundai's ADR or if there's some added geopolitical risks like with Chinese stocks."
2021-04-06 08:41:52,stocks,"AT&T has about $145 **BILLION** in debt (after taking out available cash).  With that amount of debt, I don't see them being able to fund other ventures that might help grow the stock price.

Between the two, WMT is my choice.  I recently bought into WMT a few months ago as a long term hold."
2021-04-06 07:30:31,stocks,i have walmart as a forever hold and not because of dividends
2021-04-06 15:18:42,stocks,"No, because you need to feel good to counter the times when the opposite happens."
2021-04-06 17:01:07,stocks,We looking at the same market? Lol
2021-04-06 15:25:57,stocks,What do you have?  It is mainly flat right now.
2021-04-06 12:36:06,stocks,"Pick my strategy where you hesitate because the market is ""too high"", only to watch it go higher and higher for months, defying all logic, and watching your cash on the side get eat up by inflation while people around you make money off of meme stocks. you finally crack and join in on ""durrrr its time in the market durrrr can't predict highs durrrr collar cost average"", sink your money in jan/feb and watch it bleed down."
2021-04-06 06:06:43,stocks,I hope so. Looking to get out anywhere around the $50 mark
2021-04-06 16:15:48,stocks,Just do long covered call.. I sold 55c for end of year at 4$ .. I bought it back for 1.25$ a few days later.. that shaved 2.75$ off my cost basis .. I will do it again when it reaches 27-28 again
2021-04-06 17:44:16,stocks,"They have little growth potential, they have the US government as a big client, but the US has said clearly that they already have the services from them that they need.

They have largely failed to show value to the private sector that would lead to substantial growth.

They've already received excessive interest from retail investors.

None of this makes for a good long-term investment."
2021-04-06 19:45:20,stocks,Dunno but I'm guna buy. Perhaps the concept of ceramics in technology is short lived or outdated?
2021-04-06 10:19:51,stocks,Share price is only half the equation. How many shares are outstanding?
2021-04-06 17:41:47,stocks,">SRRK

Whoever was gaming it up, stopped, and it should return to around 20 now.

I'd give it a buy point of 15 or 16."

2021-04-06 17:48:28,stocks,Do you mean Bobby Rooker?
2021-04-06 12:07:19,stocks,"Not in the near future I think. Remember reading something months ago about it being years away. They’ll probably wait till they either have a really strong recent track record on the new vessels etc, or until they really need cash to move on. Whatever happens first, probably the former I guess."
2021-04-06 12:07:48,stocks,"Nobody knows. The best thing to do is to set a [Google Alert](https://www.google.com/alerts) for things like SpaceX IPO/SpaceX Public, and so on, set up email notifications, and keep an eye on it. 

I know some people in other places have said that Musk would want to keep SpaceX private for as long as he can, but Starlink *may* be spun off into a separate entity."
2021-04-06 12:29:00,stocks,"Not sure if you can invest in it, but the Scottish Mortgage Investment trust has a small position in SpaceX.  

SMT.L is fairly growth focused overall so can be a bit volatile, but they hold a fair amount of big-potential stocks and have a pretty solid track record."

2021-04-06 08:57:37,stocks,You have a tax professional. Ask these questions to that person.
2021-04-06 10:22:23,stocks,Was a great buy late last year
2021-04-06 10:14:58,stocks,overbought.
2021-04-06 13:29:52,stocks,What exactly are they doing?
2021-04-06 19:59:24,stocks,"Definitely, just don't buy it"
2021-04-06 05:54:51,stocks,"That's the funny thing about ATH. It's only the ATH to the next one. 5 years ago, QQQ's ATH was 108. Do you think people didn't say ""how much further can it go"" back then? Because they did!"
2021-04-06 07:35:38,stocks,"Not sure about ATH, all my tech stocks are 20-30% down and looks like we will have another red week"
2021-04-06 06:52:55,stocks,"Looking at QQQ, 4 of their top 10 holdings are at ATHs, the other ones have decent room to run. I think Adbe would be number 5, at 490 to 535.

I'm breaking the sub's rule of diversification, I'm willing to go down with tech."
2021-04-06 06:07:27,stocks,ARKK still like 20% down from its ATH where I bought it so long ways to go
2021-04-06 10:37:42,stocks,AAPL and forget about it

2021-04-06 12:11:24,stocks,Kinda too late to the party. Crsr and amd still at the support
2021-04-06 10:43:16,stocks,No one with less than $20k should be investing in any individual stocks IMO. Buy VOO or VTI.
2021-04-06 17:30:59,stocks,I bought at 298. I’m happy with my decision.
2021-04-06 17:51:06,stocks,"I remember someone saying ""I'm telling you to buy ROKU before it hits $200"" when it was like $192.  I didn't."
2021-04-06 19:50:51,stocks,"Dont buy anything at the ATH, everything always dips. Also, I'd time my buy with the announcement of the McRib. Also, the french fry box looks like a horses feed bag"
2021-04-06 10:44:24,stocks,Am I reading that right? a *19%* dividend? O_o
2021-04-06 14:36:19,stocks,which is why I bought calls on TSM at $123
2021-04-06 11:39:06,stocks,Thank you!!! Feels great tbh.
2021-04-06 12:19:03,stocks,"tech stonks are back.

2021-04-06 15:40:16,stocks,underrated comment
2021-04-06 16:29:21,stocks,"There's no guarantee they'll have a seat at the table at initial release and its potentially lost opportunity for an immediately lucrative revenue base. Sounds like the four physical operators (DraftKings, Fan Duel, Bet365, and BetRivers) will likely be the ones eligible to operate mobile (possibly by this fall). PENN will either have to wait or they'll have to be a change to Cuomo's proposal. I'd say only short term because my guess is there'll be a push for expansion sooner rather than later."
2021-04-06 08:26:05,stocks,Agreed. So whatever I make on SQQQ today I will feed to TQQQ at end of day.
2021-04-06 14:56:56,stocks,"My man! This is exactly the confirmation bias I was looking for lmao. 

On the real, its AMZN so I know whenever I jump in I’ll most likely be rewarded for it in due time. Just cant resist penny pinching a bit even on long term plays lol. Appreciate the insight!"
2021-04-06 16:19:07,stocks,That is an insane TDIL
2021-04-06 13:23:10,stocks,What calls are you eyeing?
2021-04-06 12:14:45,stocks,"Vti, vgt for passive. Then some ark, moon for active, sold a bit of vti to get a bit of ark and moon they are down."
2021-04-06 17:40:43,stocks,"The thing is that highly profitable and reputable tech companies dipped as much or more than PLTR, that's where you should probably focus on first imo, especially if there's some pullback on stocks like Roku/Pins/Sq etc after today."

2021-04-06 10:16:43,stocks,"Red for the year? There's no reason to be red for the year unless you're just not diversified enough. The whole market is up over 6% YTD. Personally, I'm +9% YTD."
2021-04-06 12:29:43,stocks,I do have both of those. In the positive for DIS and in the negative for AAPL. Definitely thinking about adding more.
2021-04-06 12:29:48,stocks,Why do you say AAPL? Just curious.
2021-04-06 13:13:57,stocks,Agree with TSM and AMD and would add AAPL since they make their own chips too
2021-04-06 13:59:06,stocks,Thanks! Seems like an interesting opportunity.

2021-04-06 11:40:52,stocks,Tune out the negative noise about ARKK recently. Go look at the holdings to reassure yourself.
2021-04-06 11:07:59,stocks,"Not anytime in the medium term, for more ARK type names, mid-February to early March was their version of FAANG's early-September beatdown, only in this case, you're talking about ETFs that are so concentrated that they won't make it all the way back to ATH and beyond soon like NDX/.IXIC did late last year."
2021-04-06 11:05:10,stocks,I think so. At the current rate it'll prolly be another month or two.

2021-04-06 13:31:57,stocks,The whole sector
2021-04-06 09:58:16,stocks,"So, that's less about a number and more about looking at a few things at once.

Right now, the NASDAQ is at 13,719, but I don't consider that a significant break because the momentum indicators - MACD, Stochastics, and RSI - are all maxed out.

That tells me that we're out of gas on this attempt to break through resistance. We're probably going to stall a bit, and there's a chance we could plummet.

If, when we stall, we stay above 13,714 all the way until those momentum indicators hit their bottoms, then we'll probably be in that significant breaking territory."

2021-04-06 10:35:38,stocks,"Problem is a lot of people don't have good companies, they have money-losing companies with no real path to profits. 

If you're investing in a company that has lost money and had negative FCF for 4 of the 4 last years then you better hope it's the next TSLA because most of those go bust."

Based on my limited knowledge, I would pass."

>  you can wait for the stock to dip and buy back in 

What if it dips that same day. Can I sell a covered call within the same day? Are these kinds of things only over the course of a couple weeks? Also are options ever cheap? It feels like I always have to be spending a considerable amount of money"
2021-04-06 10:56:22,stocks,"yeah i saw the stock the other day when it did its 3:1 split, 

so it went from being like 800 dollars down to like 250 

but what really caught my attention was at the time the information on Chase's website still had the projection to 808, so i bought 2 shares at 250, it then updated a day later to go to like 270 which is still good

but TODAY!! i saw that its projection was almost 400! so Im 100% holding on to this"
2021-04-06 13:49:46,stocks,True. Just have a few shares so I don't mind holding.
2021-04-06 14:21:06,stocks,Good point. I hadn’t run the numbers well enough. I’ll hold onto my 100 shares and grab a $15 LEAP when the stock slips again.
2021-04-06 18:08:29,stocks,"Yeah unfortunately I have to accept I wont beat the market, so I'm currently just trying to come close to the market, but its hard to do without dividends haha.

2021-04-06 12:06:42,stocks,"I held sqqq at somepoint when i started investing. I was super surprised when the QQQ went up 2 $ then down 2$. My sqqq position was in the negative and i couldn't understand why at the time. To understand we need to do a little bit of math:  


sqqq is the triple inverse of the qqq.   
so lets says QQQ is at 100$ (to simplify the math) and sqqq at 20$  
lets say QQQ goes up on day 1 to 105 (+5%) Which then makes the sqqq go to 17$ (-15%)  


Then the next day the qqq goes back down to 100$ (-4.75%) which then makes the sqqq go to 19.4225$ (+14.25%)  


net result after 2 days:   


QQQ stayed at 100 (+0%)

SQQQ dropped to 19.4225 (-2.88%)  


I don't know if it helps you understand, but this is why holding sqqq for multiple weeks or even days is bad. Even if it stagnates  you will always be loosing money overtime. even if you sell your your sqqq at the same qqq price that you bought it. Once i realised that, i stayed very very far away from sqqq. Not only do you loose money if qqq rises/flatlines/drops only a little, but they will even charge you 1.02%  of managing fee!  
Its only good if you know for an absolute FACT that it will drop hard in the next 48 hours... which no one does."

2021-04-06 09:32:46,stocks,"Expiring ITM is nice because you get the maximum possible profit from selling the call, but you could end up missing out on additional gains. Ie, in your example if you sold a call at $12 strike for $1 premium and the stock expired at $20, you'd still have your $300 profit, but you missed out on a potential $800 profit if you hadn't sold the call. So expiring ITM can be a bad thing if you intend to hold the stock long term. To mitigate this, I only sell CCs at a strike I'd be okay selling the stock at.

Expiring OTM is nice because you get to keep your stock and can continue holding it to generate more income by selling more covered calls.

You can buy back into the stock at any time and sell covered calls as soon as you own the stock.

Option price depends mainly on the price of the underlying, the volatility, and the time to expiry. In general, the price of a call option increases with the price of the underlying, increases with an increase in volatility, and decreases as you get closer to the expiration date."

The other way to look at it though is people with less than 20k (or whatever arbitrary number you choose on the lower end) are generally younger, more able to overcome a setback through long term earning potential. And that can translate into an ability to be more aggressive, and to chase bigger returns that can then be diversified when the pot is bigger. All going to plan, of course. 

I like index investing. But sometimes there are opportunities in single stocks that can buoy one greatly, and I think its remiss to say anyone with a balance under X should always pass them up. I'm absolutely not saying to YOLO into memes."

2021-04-06 13:09:29,stocks,"> long term hedge

If you absolutely want to hedge then sell covered calls on stable conviction stock that you have a lot of in your portfolio. monthly or otherwise. you'll get the premium. If it goes up, well you are still happy cause your portfolio will have gone up (you get profit, but not as much as if you didn't hedge). if it stays flat or goes down then you get a nice little premium.  


The goal of hedging is to reduce risk by opening a somewhat opposite position. This does that. But that is a lot of work. A quick google search shows me that there is an ETF (QYLD: [https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/qyld/](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/qyld/)) that basically does that for you. The holdings are basically the Nasdaq Index but they sell covered calls. Instead of holding QQQ you would be holding QYLD. Every month you will get a premium.  


 I don't own QYLD and you should do your research on it before buying. But its a form of hedging that in my opinion is better than buying sqqq (also less work)"

Not really.  Crypto prices don't affect coinbase's business model, all that matters is volume.  You could argue that if a crypto sees huge gains that will increase volume, but crypto like everything is cyclical, there will be high volume and low volume, and coinbase will sit back and take little off the top of any volume.  Sure the upside is capped compared to holding crypto, BUT the downside is also capped."

2021-04-06 13:53:56,stocks,"I will expand on the ""issues"" primarily in terms of government regulations. Right now crypto is seen as an investment vehicle and is taxed accordingly. In fact, if you purchased some crypto for $100 and then you went to buy something at a retailer that cost $105 and you used some crypto now worth $105, you have to claim taxes on the $5 you gained. You can bet that Uncle Sam is going to want to regulate and get their taxes. You could see this tracking ledger for tax purposes being levied against brokerages like coin base instead of individuals self reporting. This becomes difficult since you can actually download your coin from coinbase into your own wallet, unlike places like robinhood where robinhood owns the coin, you are just listed in their ledger as an owner.  
   
I'll also point out that BTC and ETH are running very close in terms of ups and downs. These two mainstreet market kings may get other currencies to fall into similar changes which means that the attractiveness of coins is only based on their ability to be used for things.  
 
Plus a lot of people who don't understand crypto. For example caps on the amount to be mined and inflation. Doge anyone? 
   
I'll also say that coinbase can be an extremely good choice. They are well known, market to the masses, and being first to market for stocks can be a huge corporate advantage.

When they say the stock is trading for “3x 2025 revenue targets or 10x 2025 EBITDA” what formula are they using? Are they just calculating the PEG ratio for 2025 using hypothetical numbers and comparing that to current stock price? What about EBITDA 5 years out vs. current stock price how are the figuring out future EBITDA? Based on historical data?

I scoured Google every which way and sideways and there isn’t a website that explains this or I just didn’t type in my question correctly. Can some one smarter than me explain like I’m 10 on how these two things are calculated?

Thanks for reading!"

2021-04-06 05:53:48,stocks,"They’re projecting out revenues and EBITDA based on current business, the industry, and management plans. Then they’re taking that and multiplying it by X to get the predicted market cap. So if they’re saying x is 3 then the companies marketcap will be 3x total revenues for that company. 

The multiple X is a number chosen based on looking at competitors or similarly structured companies, preferably in the same industry, the growth rate, and the risk. Fast-growing stocks get better multiples. Safe industries get better multiples.

For example, let’s say Cheese Inc is a service company with expected sales in 2021 of  $15.5B. Services usually gets a year-end sales multiple of around 15.

$15.5B X 15 = analysts would expect a $232.5B market cap for Cheese Inc. 

FYI, Cheese inc, is Adobe, which means it is already fairly valued."
2021-04-06 06:18:14,stocks,"Thanks for replying, although, I’m still not quite following.  I’ll post the article i read that originated my rabbit hole:

https:// s eekingalpha. com/article/4415884-sofi-buy-this-spac-with-major-catalyst (broke the hyperlink on purpose cus of subreddit bot removing seekingalpha links)

>	The SPAC deal lists 865 million shares outstanding placing the current valuation at $15.6 billion with the stock price near $18. Investors are paying nearly 3x updated 2025 revenue targets and 10x adjusted EBITDA targets.

They went from shares outstanding, to valuation and stock price then immediately went to 3x updated 2025 revenue targets and 10x updated EBITDA targets. So they’re saying the stock is underweight at $18 and that they foresee it going down from that cus it’s overpriced but how did they get the 3x and 10x multipliers?"
2021-04-06 07:07:28,stocks,"They’re working backwards. The company itself stated a projected 2025 EBITDA as $1.5 billion (its in the article like 6 paragraphs earlier).

So if the current market cap is $15.6B then that’s $15.6 market cap / $1.5B ebitda = a multiplier of x10.

The point of all that is that they are telling you the multiplier the actual current price reflects. Basically how the stock is currently valued. It’s up to you to decide if that current multiple and current value is fair or not. The author thinks it is a decent price to pay for the company’s future growth. 

Generally, stock analysts use multiples like this to evaluate whether a stock is at a reasonable price worth paying. In general, it works like this: 

1. Calculate the current multiple for the company based on market cap and projections for a certain year. 
2. Research the company and the industry to figure out what the multiple *should* be for that company and that same certain year. 
3. Compare the two numbers. If the “correct” multiple is a lot higher than the current one that means you can expect a lot of profits from that stock (assuming you are correct, of course)."

2021-04-06 06:30:27,stocks,"It's a bull trap to fall into easily... I am myself guilty of this during several trades.

I think it should be clearer, assuming all these companies existed for the past 5 years, to review the 5 year chart (2-3 year if 5 not available) if so you might see that the initial 52 wk high might have just been an (unjustified?) run-up during the general ""madness"" of March 20 - Feb 21 bull runs.

But then you'd have to go further and look at (\*things that I look at, specifically):

\- P/E ratio

\- P/S ratio

\- DCF if you want to go that deep and make some growth assumptions of your own (or use past trajectory into the future) - I rarely even do this, as it takes too many assumptions, but it's a nice brain muscle flex. If you have a sheet set up it's ""easy"" and might give an idea of revenue trajectories.

I feel that the current markets have at least partly unhinged from ""classic"" indicators, and that should make you a double sceptic when looking to chase that 52 wk high as a benchmark for that assumed ""next wave to catch"".

Adversely, this list is totally fair to look into, if you take it as a starting point for doing further research.

Two things to look for:

\- has a stock gone *down* unjustly, as opposed to what I say above. Ie. has a stock that might have rode along on that 2020 bull wave now taken an unjustified hit and indeed might be seen as ""discounted""?

\- If so, then check if the 15% rough ""discount"" from 52 week or even ATH justified for the underlying.

There might well be 5-10 in that ticker list that merit further diligence on if you might actually invest into an unjustly run-down stock that will recover and maybe then some.

Speaking for myself I am sceptical of valuations across a vast array of stocks, there's a lot of ""mixed"" signals and I think ultimately insecurity in the markets due to mainly the cash flowing in from all sides."

We have had several technological revolutions in the past and I’m not sure the economy has changed in the way that would support her argument here.

2021-04-06 03:12:26,stocks,"Real gdp growth is not something that is higher or lower than reported, only NGDP can be revised based upon RGDP number. RGDP is real output = income in an economy, so she's right that tech is hugely deflationary and has probably been the main driver that's pushed interest rates to low levels.

Inflation, on the other hand, can be fully determined by monetary policy absent supply shocks. Notice how we've not had significant supply shocks since the oil shocks, mainly because technology has improved our supply chains so that thing don't get bottlenecked anymore. This implies that inflation is neither determined by growth nor by technology, but by the Fed. If they see signs that NGDP picks up higher than RGDP for extended time (nominal income outpaces real income, or more money chasing goods not being produced with fast enough technological progress) then they tighten policy and vice versa. The nature of the technology, whether it's textile mills or supercomputers, is irrelevant.

Inflation numbers, whether you look at PPI or CPI or PCE or the GDP deflator or independent measures like billion prices project, all fall roughly in line, suggesting there's no systematic, artificial revision upwards or downwards.

Leaving that aside. Is that kind of presenting a case something you should take at face value or ask yourself ""how do you make a scientific, testable argument that you and the public can run a theory or data against""?

I can't see how ""GDP is wrong"" and ""inflation is probably"" lower and both are ""measured wrong"" should be universal truths all of a sudden?

If you want to measure GDP differently (or do away with it as an indicator of economic health overall), go ahead, do reasearch, hire mathematicians, statisticians and economic masterminds to rework and redo a tried and tested, and well-proven, model.

Run your simulations and present a case of how your model is better in the future by projecting some recent, real-world data into it and prove your point.

All this perceived ""great productivity increase"" will in all likelihood be bought by a decrease in average income - GDP is usually tightly connected to CPI.

So exactly how that should be *universally* good for us all is for her to tell us I believe? I fail to see the point.

This is what Wood is talking about when it comes to deflation. Not absolute prices per say - but you are getting infinitely more for your money on innovative tech than you did 20 years ago. That is where all the growth is going to come from in the next 20 years. 

The net result of deflation is the ability to get more from the same input. Think about how many people use google search now. You don't think about a simple google search as deflation but your ability to search is infinitely more powerful than the people who had to use yahoo in 2000.

But a good example of bad shareholder payouts are the auto makers.  In the face of huge technological change and opportunity, they chose to keep paying out rich dividend yields rather than investing in the obvious coming EV disruption.  When their R&D spending was incredibly low risk for them.

That’s what Cathie Wood is saying here.  Not that dividends or buybacks are bad, but rather, are expedient choices for companies that are on their last legs.

Given the massive increase in our money supply in the past year, the only thing keeping GDP in check right now is the covid crisis stifling innovation (due to people needing to stay home). Most of that growth in GDP is going to come from innovative companies (a lot of which are in Ark funds).

This is also why countries with stagnant or declining populations like Japan and old Europe have had stagnant stock markets. They are unable to increase their money velocity because there's not enough young people taking advantage of the increase in self-agency provided by innovation."

2021-04-06 01:44:56,stocks,"It’s funny you say this is irrational, in psychology hanging on to a loss is irrational.  Human beings will rarely take big risks with money to make money, unless they’ve already lost and are waiting for it to come back.  There’s a study where people and even monkeys are offered a 50/50 chance to double their money or to get a guaranteed 50% on their money.  They take the 50% guaranteed at an almost 80% clip.  If they’re offered the situation in reverse, lost %50 automatically or just get all of your money back or lose it all they take risk to get their money back.  It’s actually considered highly irrational by psychologists because the statistics say this a bad play.  I guess all of those millionaires who are dying to make you rich in the market too, give you the opposite advice, even though most of them are highly versed in statistics.  Maybe that or they just need you to baghold so they can get out at decent positions."

2021-04-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Why do limit orders react instantly to market orders, and how could this cause a momentary increase of nearly 10% on both sides? I'm not allowed to mention the specific underlying here, but I think it doesn't really matter what the underlying is as it seems every market is vulnerable to this kind of thing. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I figured many of you would know the answer to this question. There are two main parts:

&#x200B;

1) As I understand it the basic principle is to execute market orders which will change the price in your favor. This is would be extremely simple, but there is a level of complexity to how this is achieved. I tested this and found that multiple consecutive orders with the same price action need to be registered in order for any useful effect to happen. The best way to describe it is that these consecutive orders accelerate the direction of the price. It would be odd to have this just be a feature of markets, but I can only assume it's other investors creating this effect. Who is sitting there waiting for price action to make a limit order? Is that not literally what market orders are for? Also, why in the world would two market orders in a row make anyone more eager? I am completely confused how this works...

&#x200B;

2)Today I watched what appeared to be the accelerating effect I mentioned above. Both the ask and the bid sides were given forward momentum through market orders. I have never seen anything like this before, but I believe it had something to do with a limit order being spent. The underlying fucking leapt. I felt like I was in a whirlpool. You literally couldn't read any of the limit orders unless you were just focusing on the center. Even then it was anyone's guess what the next one up would be, so.... is this people being speculative, or is this abuse of a fundamental part of the market?"
2021-04-06 00:18:32,stocks,"If a large at-market order comes in, it can take out several limit orders in the book. That widens the spread and the MM adds orders on the other side of the book to narrow it. Essentially they're flipping the position they just took because they do not want to carry a balance if they can avoid it."

But then I read that mutual funds are useful when wanting to trade in a selection of stocks (as well as ETFs).

PS: Not looking for specific funds to invest in, just some basic knowledge."
2021-04-05 23:15:00,stocks,"Index funds are a fund strategy mutual funds are an investment vehicle.

You could have an index fund that is an ETF or an index fund that is in a mutual fund.  Both ETF’s and mutual funds can have strategies other than being an index fund.  Examples of index ETF’s would be QQQ, SCHX, VTI, etc. They each are index funds that track NASDAQ, or the S&P, or the total stock market. SWSSX is an example of a mutual fund that is a small cap index fund. Index funds have a collection of holdings that tracks some target, like the same growth rate as NASDAQ or any of the other indices. 

Mutual funds and ETF’s follow different rules and have different structures, but for your purposes they are both vehicles to diversify your holdings and reduce risk. ETF’s can be quickly bought, sold, and traded like a stock. Their values update constantly while the market is open. Mutual funds have rules about when they update, when holdings can be updated, how long you have to hold them before they can be sold and stuff like that. 

In broad strokes, if you’re investing long term there isn’t much difference between mutual fund s and ETFs in the growth you should see if they are indexed to the same target."

A mutual fund is a pool that other people put money into together. Hence “mutual”-done by 2 or more parties. The money in the funds are then divided up between a certain number of stocks. These are usually managed by mutual fund managers which take a percentage such as 1% regardless of whether you make money or not.

ETFs have the flexibility of selling whenever you want when market is open, at whatever the price is at that moment, like a stock. But you need to buy full shares. Eg, SPY is $407 per share 

Mutual funds if you wanted to sell, they typically sell your shares at market close. Most have a minimum starting investment but you can contribute any amount after that initial investment to buy fractional shares. 

If you want mutual funds, open a Vanguard account. This can be attractive if you want an automated investment strategy where you don’t even have to pay attention, just set it to auto invest into VTSAX"

2021-04-06 01:33:00,stocks,"I can see the rationale behind the growth patterns.

Those with the highest influence on the profit margins will grow faster than those without.  This may be due to customers having a hands-on feel for the product, visual cues, as well as easier to market and develop from an end-user's perspective (you already know what they are going to do, so can tailor it exclusively towards that).

DevOps, CDN, and Cybersecurity are all expenses with no direct relation to the profitability of a company.  DevOps and CDN help development, but unfortunately the customers who do buy these tend to be more business oriented and think ""they are developers, they should be doing this anyways.  We don't need this since this doesn't drive profits.  Make dev work easier?  What do I pay you for?""  And cybersecurity is similar however it only crops up when breaches happen and people hear about it.  If no one hears about it, then did a breach really happen?  So most try to find the solution that is ""just good enough"" without hurting their bottom line.

Marketplace is the outlier here, as it's neither a cost or profit driven motive.  It's like an eBay of sorts, but it also depends on how it's monetized and utilized by it's users.  More users = more traffic.  More monetization can lead to higher profits and/or less users.  So like Social Networks, it needs to build a user base before it can monetize.  However it has additional leg work to do depending on what type of goods it's attempting to sell and the Marketplace not being user driven (compared to Social Networks)."

When I called the broker, they put in a market sell order and told me my confirmation would be sent to my email later. 

They sold my shares for $62.58/share

Brk.b traded today at $260-263.35

Does anyone know how this is even possible? I understand market orders won’t exercise at the exact price, but a 76% loss, is absolutely crazy. 

Is there no sort of protection against this kind of thing? How does this even happen? 

The broker is closed now for the evening, but will be calling first thing in the morning. 

Looking for some helpful information or thing I can reference when I call in the morning at open.






EDIT UPDATE:

Called them this morning. They didn’t even answer the phone during their posted business hours. Just adds the the amazing service this company provides. 

After calling the number for the old platform holders, and nearly 25mins on hold, they found a person for me to speak with.

I described the problem and the representative n the phone seemed like this was normal at first. She then had a light bulb go off and remembered they had an internal email she quickly glossed over that discussed this issue. She asked me to hold so she could review it again. 

Apparently there was an error on the new platform that didn’t perform the sell orders correctly. They were suppose to sell at $262.276.

I asked when, if, they would be correcting this and if they planned to notify the customers. They said that they were in the process of correcting the error but never notified the customers of the issue(wonderful, thanks). 

I guess it also takes 10 days after the sell date, to receive my money. Also, she confirmed they still don’t sell fractional shares. 

I plan to no longer use them, but leave the remaining 1.5 shares or so that’s left in there, forever.

Right now, Volkswagens1, the stock trades over-the-counter at 10 cents a share. And by the way, Volkswagens1, our analysts indicate it could go a heck of a lot higher than that. Your profit on a mere $6,000 investment would be upwards of $60,000!

Exactly. You could pay off your mortgage.

Volkswagens1, one thing I can promise you, even in this market, is that I never ask my clients to judge me on my winners. I ask them to judge me on my losers because I have so few. And in the case of Aerotyne, based on every technical factor out there, Volkswagens1, we are looking at a grand slam home run."
2021-04-05 23:41:49,stocks,"Lmao this is why young ppl are always making old ppl feel like they're getting shit on, today a 7 year old could had sold your brk.b shares for market price more effectively"
2021-04-05 22:37:47,stocks,That’s messed up man.  Maybe they missed the 2 I front of the $62.58 on the confirmation?  A market order would trigger them to sell and obtain the ask price for the number of shares you want to sell.  Bid / ask spreads may be large on illiquid stocks but certainly not on brk.b
2021-04-05 23:07:26,stocks,Your broker is hoping you don't know the true price!
2021-04-06 00:22:00,stocks,whos ur broker? name and shame
2021-04-06 02:47:52,stocks,this is unacceptable
2021-04-06 03:05:29,stocks,"If they don't make good when you call them, contact your district attorney's office.  I think it is also possible to find out what price stock transactions were executed for each day. There are some shady brokers who bleed their client's accounts dry. I have read too many accounts of similar stories.

After you get your money, close your account. There is no excuse for this type of foul-up."
2021-04-06 09:35:47,stocks,Lol people in here acting like a phone call is high effort
2021-04-06 13:38:21,stocks,I'm sure there are at least 5000 attorneys who would take 1/3 of the profits from your sale to make you whole on the trade..
2021-04-06 13:55:17,stocks,"It is not a good idea to place a market order.  If you put in a limit order below the current market price, you will get the market price, and will never get less than your limit price."
2021-04-06 15:03:48,stocks,"> I called the broker, they put in a market sell order    
>  
> Is there no sort of protection against this kind of thing? 

Limit orders?"
2021-04-05 22:34:39,stocks,"This sounds like you need to call tech support, not Reddit. They are pocketing the difference."

2021-04-06 00:18:52,stocks,I think it will auto correct in the morning. I been with Vanguard the last month and they been pretty cool and knowledgeable.
2021-04-06 02:06:13,stocks,Make sure to give us an update on how it goes. Seems like a mistake but you never know
2021-04-06 03:07:18,stocks,definitely human error. supposed to be 262.58 but mistyped the 2. call them asap when they open
2021-04-06 06:23:18,stocks,"Do you have online access to account? If so, look at your transaction history as it should have the correct numbers for the trade."
2021-04-06 06:44:23,stocks,Did you also ask the gas station attendant to revulcanize your tire rubber post haste?
2021-04-06 08:02:28,stocks,"My mom trades online now. Get with the times.

In all seriousness, double check with them. If they did make a reporting mistake, you should leave them because that's insane. If they really did sell your shares for a massive loss, you need to file complaints against them. There is plenty of information out there on how to do this."
2021-04-06 09:08:13,stocks,Lower price means lower taxes
2021-04-06 09:23:27,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-06 09:26:20,stocks,So after OP's update - did he actually lose $200 a share or did it sell at market value?
2021-04-06 09:29:49,stocks,"Wow I’d be very irritated. You mentioned the firm on a thread but why not mention them on your main one? Good to avoid bs like that. Too many headaches. Sounds annoying like RH, but thanks for sharing!"
2021-04-06 10:25:53,stocks,You call your broker to place orders? seems weird. I always just fax mine =P
2021-04-06 11:04:32,stocks,"God!
That must of been such a frustrating experience.

There are so many terrible brokers out there."
2021-04-06 11:08:54,stocks,I just want to ask the OP how he found Global Shares Equity and why did he decide to initially open an account with that firm?
2021-04-06 12:14:39,stocks,Somebody got a heck of a deal off your brokers mistake. Ouch!!
2021-04-06 12:15:25,stocks,I still go to the post office to look at the ticker tape
2021-04-06 12:54:21,stocks,Ty for naming and shaming a dodgy broker. Hopefully its helpful to others at least 🐵👍
2021-04-06 13:05:22,stocks,"Lawyer up, save the emails, record the voicecalls."
2021-04-06 14:22:46,stocks,"The person on the other side of that order must have felt so lucky.  Sorry OP, I hope you get your money back."
2021-04-06 14:58:34,stocks,Sounds super sketchy... like if the clients didn't complain would they just take the money?
2021-04-06 15:12:35,stocks,I need to start just discounting my share price so some random brokerage like yours can sell me $AAPL shares for like $20
2021-04-06 15:48:52,stocks,You should be able to transfer your shares to a discount broker. Open an account there and submit for a transfer or assets. Your old firm may change a transfer or close out fee. Most discount brokers let you sell fractional shares.  So even with a $75 fee it’s still better then leaving it there I definitely.
2021-04-06 15:57:17,stocks,This sounds like Wall Street 1987 😂
2021-04-06 17:58:42,stocks,I never buy or sell market always use limit to avoid any shenanigans  on my purchase or sale. If I buy I put a limit price a little below the ask and if I sell I out a limit a little above the ask.  It usually hits it pretty quickly.
2021-04-06 18:06:56,stocks,Call the broker to sell stocks? What year is it?
2021-04-06 18:09:06,stocks,"LIMIT ORDERS ALWAYS 

Its part of the religion"
2021-04-06 18:58:38,stocks,You might want this information in an e-mail so you have proof.
2021-04-05 23:24:28,stocks,Sounds like my bookie
2021-04-06 03:06:31,stocks,"I don't get it, why would you call your broker in order to liquidate the underlying? Couldn't you do it yourself?"
2021-04-06 02:26:57,stocks,Why not do things yourself online at Fidelity?
2021-04-06 13:12:21,stocks,If you place a market order instead of a limit order then you deserve any loss you get for being stupid.
2021-04-06 04:00:49,stocks,Who would post this before calling the broker and making sure it wasn’t a mistake lol over react much?
2021-04-05 23:42:59,stocks,Looks like ya hot ripped by failing to put in a limit sell....that BLOWS. I'd be pissed af.
2021-04-06 00:58:10,stocks,What broker is that? Just so I don't use it
2021-04-06 01:40:33,stocks,"Dude, you still trade over the phone? I mean either it's a weird place and therefore a clerical error, or i'm not sure. Keep posted!"
2021-04-06 02:13:37,stocks,Who the hell is your broker
2021-04-06 02:14:32,stocks,fidelity is better than brokers.
2021-04-06 02:23:57,stocks,They sent you a confirmation that is automatically generated or someone had to handwrite that confirmation?
2021-04-06 03:33:51,stocks,"It's probably a mistake, but regardless - never do market orders."
2021-04-06 03:58:22,stocks, 😈
2021-04-06 07:25:39,stocks,And you don't have access to an online account where you can trade yourself?
2021-04-06 08:23:31,stocks,"It probably sold for the correct price. Switch to a standard large broker like Fidelity, Schwab or Vanguard. I've been investing for 25+ years and have never called to have a trade executed. I just don't get why people use brokerages that have these issues."
2021-04-06 08:32:27,stocks,"You let others control your money and you also sold at market order...(that's why we use limit orders)... Probably got frontrun at lowest possible price by a bot. Or broker bought the shares from you. Either way, never let others control your money. Get advice, act on it, watch it..... Control it!"
2021-04-06 08:35:31,stocks,"Assuming this was a good chunk since it seems to be a 100% BRK account, why not ask to set up a limit order? MO sounds like a plan to leak a bunch of slippage."
2021-04-06 09:42:21,stocks,"What were the pros and cons of Global Shares Equity compared to big firms(Vanguard, Schwab, Fidelity)?

Is it better to switch to another small firm?"
2021-04-06 10:43:44,stocks,Sounds like you paid the price for someone else's sell-order typo.  Contact the regulating authority.
2021-04-06 10:53:40,stocks,I'm blown away people use exchanges other than Fidelity and Vanguard
2021-04-06 11:25:21,stocks,"Certainly! You gave them power to do so........
Never piss off the guy who has your balls in his hand... 

Why I never use them. Shield yourself against guys that are losing money. He probably put the buy order in for your shares before hand. Yes! They can do that shit. Sorry about your loss. Call a lawyer and read over your agreement."
2021-04-06 11:25:58,stocks,Were these shares purchased via margin originally? Or with cash?
2021-04-06 11:50:10,stocks,"What brokerage are you using?  Who does transactions via phone conversations anymore?  Don't you have an online account where you can see everything that is going on?  The whole story sounds wrong, to be honest.  You need to get documentation of the trade either online or on paper immediately.  Vague remarks from their rep on the phone is not helping.  Based on the case as you presented it, you don't know what happened, why, or how."
2021-04-06 13:26:41,stocks,"Also:

**Do not use Robinhood** for other shady reasons"
2021-04-06 13:35:51,stocks,Get an actual broker before you lose thousands
2021-04-06 14:09:44,stocks,So what broker is this?
2021-04-06 14:28:29,stocks,"This sort of thing happens no matter who you use. But since it happens to 1.0x-0^-23 trades you’re unlikely to ever come across it unless you work for a broker/dealer. Also, you shouldn’t be shocked if you can’t get your broker on the phone in the days around Easter weekend. The bastard is probably spending time with his family!!! THE NERVE!!!"
2021-04-06 15:41:34,stocks,"Okay telling people the broker should have been in the first post, not edit 2... Could be people having the same issue or trying go there."
2021-04-06 16:16:50,stocks,"You should check, in DEGIRO there are some stocks with 15 minutes delay. So you could seeing a certain price there that it was not the one you had at the moment the transaction ocurred."
2021-04-05 23:34:18,stocks,"take the L and move on 

or just call your broker and say what the fvck?!"
2021-04-06 14:06:18,stocks,"I'm sorry but anyone who feels they need to post this ""Ripped Off"" post only to find out, and not have common sense enough to KNOW it was a bad print or a typo probably should get a bit more educated in both the market and life.  It wasn't a $10 error or even a $1 error but an exact $200 per share error knowing the correct price.  They don't ""notify"" they usually have it in some section of the site about things like that, see 99/100 people can figure that out without a call.  You say the ""still don't sell fractional shares"" so you may not like it but you did know it.  Being sent your money after 10 days, that'll depend on how your acct. was set-up.  Was it set up to auto mail proceeds, send all proceeds on the last day of the month, 6 days ago??  Sometimes we may not like an outcome but to find the error takes looking at yourself first."
2021-04-05 22:50:16,stocks,Actually this is how the ultra ultra rich still trade (granted OP doesn’t give off that vibe haha)
2021-04-05 22:45:43,stocks,"I do, when they change platforms and you are unable to access their website. I’ve been trying to sell shares for over a week now, then this happens"

2021-04-06 04:07:06,stocks,"People who have been trading that way for twenty years and used the same guy. And they can rattle off 7 options in 20 seconds. And get some heads up in the next 20 sec. Then he asks how the family is doing, and is off the phone in under a minute.

Then he slows down from 90mph to 75mph."
2021-04-06 02:59:27,stocks,"More than you might expect. For my more conservative, longterm growth oriented portfolios I have a broker. They handle all the tax bullshit and that’s worth something."
2021-04-06 17:19:54,stocks,My first thought.
2021-04-06 03:09:53,stocks,"It's actually fucking dope. I mean I haven't done it myself, but I did call ETRADE support (something I couldn't doat all  with RH after 2017, and had to wait an hour and a half to get on the phone with Webull) and when the agent told me he could execute the options trade on my behalf that I was calling about, it felt quite amazing."
2021-04-06 02:27:32,stocks,Right.
2021-04-06 12:11:54,stocks,"I lost 6% of my 5k portfolio in less than two weeks. If my portfolio were in the millions of dollars, I sure as hell wouldn't trust myself to take care of it.

2021-04-06 13:02:17,stocks,I've been trying to get out of my WellsFargo Advisor since  3/19 still say 4/9... only way to trade until then is calling them...
2021-04-06 15:25:03,stocks,Me.
2021-04-06 15:33:10,stocks,I work at a bank where some clients still send market orders requests by Fax.
2021-04-06 16:13:59,stocks,"Only call if it's on the pinks. Or if you need to borrow or roll shares to another exchange.

But I think the poster is being misled by his account, as there were no trades completed at 62$ so he could not have sold at 62$.
Given he says he is leaving 1.5 shares, the possibility that he sold 0.5 share and having incurred a fee by selling with the broker its possible that his fee is 60$ and the remaining balance is 62$.

Also probable that he must wait for shares to clear the next day before seeing actual balance."

2021-04-06 00:18:19,stocks,Kind of world is this where fax is the faster way to do anything. 80s tech shouldn't win.
2021-04-06 01:14:13,stocks,I read this and wonder why not just use an app lol
2021-04-06 05:44:00,stocks,I just page my broker and and they send a messenger boy with the confirmation. About a week later I receive my denarius.

2021-04-05 22:37:26,stocks,Thanks. I’ll tell them this tomorrow
2021-04-06 08:18:20,stocks,He said they did a market order not a limit order... There wouldn't be any inputs of numbers on a market order.
2021-04-05 22:35:10,stocks,"I could easily see if being a 5% difference or so, but this sort of loss has got to sounds some sort of alarm or flag before the order is sold."
2021-04-06 03:39:03,stocks,That would have caused a halt
2021-04-05 22:40:32,stocks,"They changed over systems and I’m unable to enter my sell orders. For whatever reason, their new website doesn’t allow me to use an iPhone, or android to sell shares. You have to be using a desktop in order to sell shares."
2021-04-06 13:45:24,stocks,TD is better IMO. Fidelity is a pain for trading options
2021-04-05 23:25:44,stocks,I have an account with them also
2021-04-06 13:30:41,stocks,Adding to this: Tweeting at their company or posting on any of their social media is considered a written complaint and must be responded to in addition to filing with the relevant SROs

I have a bad feeling this likely won’t be in my favor, but could be wrong"
2021-04-06 09:16:35,stocks,I would have easily maxed out my loss to write off for the year. Although my $45k loss last year is still carrying over
2021-04-06 09:24:03,stocks,I wish I had a broker that was cool like that 😎
2021-04-06 09:29:02,stocks,"I honestly don’t know if they sold at that price and are eating the difference, or if the platform just shows the error. Either way, they say it will be corrected and I’ll receive market price of approx $262/share"
2021-04-06 09:30:24,stocks,I’ll update main post with the broker
2021-04-06 14:04:12,stocks,It’s an employee stock purchase program
2021-04-06 14:24:38,stocks,"Sounds like I should, I’m just hesitant because of the errors and lack of communication."
2021-04-06 16:04:34,stocks,I’ll look into this once the initial sell is confirmed and I have payment

I suppose I shouldn't have assumed a massive fluctuation in the market price would do that. If they market sell shares this cheap when people sell, I'm going to tell them I want every penny I have converted to their opposing end, so I can purchase that low. They sure as hell never allocated me shares that cheap"
2021-04-06 04:46:25,stocks,It’s a generated confirmation letter

Never in my wildest dreams did I expect this to happen"
2021-04-06 08:48:36,stocks,Updating thread up top in a moment.
2021-04-06 09:50:28,stocks,"The only pro, why I initially used them was convenience for fractional share purchase, as well as deductions from my check. 

Con, everything thereafter. Cashing out, getting ahold of the broker, representatives not knowing the correct information, changing of platforms(inability to sell during change), inability to sell fractional shares, notifications of changes and/or errors to customers, cash out period, among others..."
2021-04-06 14:05:01,stocks,Cash. Paycheck deduction
2021-04-05 23:44:30,stocks,The L on this is significant

2021-04-06 08:35:22,stocks,Did you make sure to ask all of them how they trade before posting this?
2021-04-06 13:02:54,stocks,you mean the ultra old lol.  Most of my rich friends use coinbase/robinhood/m1 etc. they don't use traditional brokers anymore.
2021-04-06 05:53:15,stocks,"Am ultra rich. Have investment employees do it all themselves. Have meeting once a month to review their progress and the risk. Screw having to watch the account I pay them to manage and profit off on a daily basis 😂 they manage a lower risk account and gain 8-15% a year. They don't keep up, they lose the account. I can't imagine anyone ultra rich doing what OP does. Friend of mine has £115m in an account with same guys as me, she meets with them fortnightly to catch up but they manage the entire account themselves.


We both then have a small account on the side which we freely trade on for fun."
2021-04-06 16:22:05,stocks,"My assumption is that this is because they're not trading per se, but rather doing asset allocation shifting which probably requires a phone call conversation."

2021-04-05 23:20:28,stocks,Did you see your broker sniffling the other day and now he's on a south america trip?
2021-04-06 09:43:29,stocks,Looking forward to an update today! Fingers crossed for you that it’s corrected now or they do today!
2021-04-06 09:29:55,stocks,I’m talking about after the trade. Some brokers have people manually post execution information to the account
2021-04-05 22:35:45,stocks,Its a mistake its probably 262.58$
2021-04-06 02:36:16,stocks,"On a pretty liquid stock like Berkshire that difference wouldn't even be a full percent unless the market is collapsing or it's done after hours.

2021-04-05 22:48:16,stocks,"Ok, I mean, sounds like an honest mistake to me and would give them a chance to explain. In the meantime I would read up on the duty of care requirements so you can bring that up if you need to, doubt it will come to that."

2021-04-05 22:47:48,stocks,Wtf?? Why didn’t you transfer your account away from that shit show?$15 per share is ripoff and undoubtedly must be illegal
2021-04-06 02:43:28,stocks,$15 per share fee is 1980’s type costs.  Since the 90’s even at an in person broker I’ve never paid $100 for a trade.  Run like hell man.
2021-04-06 05:45:38,stocks,$15 per share? Holy shit that’s got to be the worst I’ve ever heard.
2021-04-06 10:00:01,stocks,15$ per share? please tell me that’s a mistake? So any share you buy you just add $15 to the cost basis? wtf??
2021-04-06 09:26:21,stocks,45k... Are you ultra rich or just some stupid plays?
2021-04-06 10:01:54,stocks,Thank you!
2021-04-06 14:21:46,stocks,Ok that makes a lot of sense. It looks like that firm specializes in ESOPs and not retail brokerage. It is odd that a firm working with your employer in fractional shares is not capable of liquidating fractional shares.
2021-04-06 14:25:37,stocks,"That's how they get away with screwing over people like you.  They don't want you to follow up because then they will have to fix their mistake, so they deliberately make it inconvenient."
2021-04-06 19:00:35,stocks,Good idea. Good luck
2021-04-06 02:46:03,stocks,They have a duty to notify you of such a substantial loss from current market price.  Most brokers if you under price or overprice a limit trade by 10% auto cancel the order.
2021-04-06 08:26:55,stocks,"I assume everything will be fine, just reach out to give them a call."
2021-04-06 10:00:12,stocks,"Fidelity has been good to me.

They offer fractional shares.  They do their own clearing.  My biggest issue is their conservative policies.  I have been with them 10+ years, but they won't approve level 2 options.  

Level 2 quotes are out of my reach, due to not enough trading activity."
2021-04-06 15:48:12,stocks,"Hm that's quite odd. I'm sure you're pretty pissed, I would be."

2021-04-06 07:38:29,stocks,2.5% of overall profit isn't bad at all.  I've always been quoted 1% of total assets under management starting at $1m and less beyond the first $1m under management.  Set up your own risk and other parameters and let them trade.

2021-04-06 00:02:29,stocks,How is this even a buy at 40? Market cap of nearly 30b and their business is essentially television channels. It’s a dying business.

I'm sure some of the additional loss in share value can be attributed to the short term scrutiny of their risk/compliance practices this fiasco will bring as well as future clients they might lose as a result of the hit their reputation took. However, did the company really become more than a quarter less valuable? I highly doubt it"
2021-04-05 23:55:30,stocks,This is a massive international bank that's already down 23% in a month. That's like a tech company being down nearly 50%. I'd imagine most of the damage has been done.

2021-04-06 14:27:23,stocks,"I bought VIAC and CS on the news, and they're trading close to flat since then.

It isn't that the crash is artificial, it is that most drop too far, then recover a little bit. When it first finds a bottom, that includes not just people who didn't like the price anymore, but people who lost confidence in the companies, and want out regardless. That will usually push the bottom down a little bit below the new valuation, but after those people are gone, the price will move to whatever the market thinks the correct price really is.

It comes down to the question: Did the companies successfully hide part of the bad news, or is it all out on the table? If they hid part of the news, then it will go down more. If they didn't, it won't.👼"

There was no ""agreement"" lol. The meeting was left as a general understanding of not trying to cause panic. If you actually think there's anything legally binding to that, then you're far too naive to be commenting here.

Also, they were slow in the sense that its been 1.5 weeks since GS pulled the trigger on block sales and just yesterday CS offered its first block package for VIAC FTCH and VIPS."

They are literally the complete scum of our society. Every single action they take is intended to be predatory and motivated by greed.

2021-04-06 14:33:21,stocks,"That's not what was reported.

What was reported was that the US banks entered negotiations, failed to receive complete disclosure of the risk, and so acted on their own.

This is always the way it works. Welcome to America. You stand with your hand behind your back, we're not going to play nice. You want a deal, ***put your cards on the table.*** You want to say, ""Well, we can't tell you what we know, but lets agree to collude as we go and share the losses."" No. Not going to happen. Show your cards, and keep your finger next to the button in case we say no. Make sure your proposal is actually better for both of us, don't try to blow smoke and offer for us to take part of your share of the losses.

What Virtuous Euopeans often neglect to consider is that the US markets, and US banking, are open to the entire world, and all the world's scammers are already here, trying to scam us. We're used to taking counter-measures for that. If we didn't know how to protect ourselves from you, we wouldn't have open markets, open banking.👩‍🎓👼"

They pretty much have taken roles in some very shady deals that have gutted entire country funds but didn't have to admit guilt or pay a big fine.  For GS, it's just the cost of doing business.  Their legal team is very impressive, they basically never lose.

GS is pretty much known as ""untouchable"".  Look up 1MBD, the fines in relation to revenue and what not."

All the banks that worked with this fund were trying to earn shady money by working with them. That's *why* they extended so much credit!

As for CS, I bought shares, if they were as good as Goldman-Sachs at being sleazy it wouldn't have created a buying opportunity! As it is, I got a good price on a stock at the expense of existing shareholders who are still way down. That is as it should be, but only one side of it creates an opportunity for the little person."

Some folks do solely look at technicals though and pay no attention to the company itself."

2021-04-06 13:53:16,stocks,"Hell no lol I pray for the people who use motley fool as a source of investing advice

I've been in FTCH since $14 last year and have been buying any dip I can, especially this Archegos one at $43. I personally love their product and have been using it for a while, so I decided to invest a bit of money into them. It was after viewing their financials, growth strategy and new strategic partners that it's now one of my top holdings. They just had an investor conference today actually if you're interested in learning more

Here's a couple criteria to consider:

\- Revenue of $1.7B which equates to a roughly 10 P/S ratio. LVMH, a comparable company with much less future growth potential, is sitting at a 6.5 P/S ratio. 

\- Revenue also grew 70% from $1B in 2019 to $1.7B in 2020. This isn't a covid trend. Revenue has grown from less than $400m in 2017.

\- Positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time in Q4 2020

\- $1.6B cash on the balance sheet due to investments from Alibaba, Richemont and Artemis

\- Luxury fashion is a market that is growing rapidly (especially in China where FTCH is backed by BABA and launched on TMall this quarter) and has high profit margins

\- Luxury fashion is one that has historically been extremely hesitant to e-commerce with small penetration. Now they recognize it as a necessity and the best way is to partner with FTCH. Take a look at what FTCH is doing with its technology (e-concessions and e-concessions-as-a-service). Also, how they are elevating the customer experience, both online with loyalty programs/personal stylists and now at their Browns store opening in London. They are revolutionizing the industry."

If you really think that you can look at fundamentals, which is about the past, to decide on the import of what has happened just now that was in the news, then sure, you could use that. But generally, that information isn't out yet.

So you have to use behavioral considerations. And there are people who do have access to that more current fundamental data, and those people will be trading rationally and helping to set the new price. So that tends to lead to the bottom being slightly lower than the price it stabilizes at.

Just look the charts every time something goes down and is in the news, regardless of if you're invested in it or not. There are consistent patterns to be noticed."

Telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) can be an income machine for stimulus check recipients at $30 per share

For example, the rollout of 5G networks should be a significant positive for AT&T. It's been a decade since the last upgrade of wireless download speeds, which suggests that consumers and businesses will be jumping at the prospect of updating their wireless devices. Since AT&T generates its juiciest margins from wireless data, an increase in download speeds can only improve its operating margins.


AT&T also stands to benefit from its push into streaming. Despite a slow start to the launch of HBO Max in late May, AT&T's subscriber numbers have picked up significantly in recent months.

You might be wrong about the market (it's possible that MO will never re-rate), but if you're roughly right about the business, you would still get your original capital back by just holding and collecting the dividends.

T has more business risk IMHO, for example they could mismanage and fail to capitalize on HBO. However, the core wireless business is almost a duopoly (it's more like a ""triopoly"") and will be hard to disrupt (Google tried giving people free wireless but nothing ever came out  of it)."

Also a thank you.

&#x200B;

Looking at  QYLD  it pays the dividend every month and not quarterly like AT&T.

&#x200B;

Using the last monthly dividend of 0.224 on March 22 and multiplying by 12 gives a yearly dividend amount of $2.688 or 11.8% annual yield.

&#x200B;

Even using the lowest dividend of $0.199 on April 20, 2020 gives $2.388 annually which gives 10.5% annual yield.

&#x200B;

Also I see QYLD has been paying monthly dividends since December 2013.

Instead they listen to lobbyists who make bs claims that everyone needs 100mbps down and symmetrical up.  Yeah... ok... I have to side with AT&T on this one.  Why don't they focus on connecting rural America first before wasting money on 10 mbps upload speeds everywhere.  And don't get me started on how bad the government is messing up free market dynamics in this space.  Yes,  AT&T is protecting its interests but look at the companies who are winning government funds lately.  Companies with 1 million in annual revenue are winning 50 million in funding,  its insane.  The big guys like T don't play in that space because they know better (unnecessary rules and regs).

ATT has bloat. Lots of prior acquisitions and business units. They are looking to streamline and focus, which includes paying debt and maintaining their dividend. Selling crunchy roll, a stake in directTV and several of their other divestitures fit that strategy"
2021-04-06 09:12:08,stocks,"Quote:  

**The ex-dividend date is defined as the day on which a trade will settle too late to give the buyer the dividend payment**. Simply put, the ex-dividend date is typically two business days before the record date.

**Because the ex-dividend concept already includes the settlement delay, the settlement date can happen on or after the ex-dividend date. However, the trade date has to be before the ex-dividend date in order for the settlement date to be on or before the record date -- and therefore for the buyer to receive the dividend.**

Dividend timing can seem complicated. The simplest rule to remember is that, if you want the dividend, be sure to make your stock trade before the ex-dividend date. That will make the settlement details all fall into place correctly.

At this same time, it seems one of my favorite bars is taking on initial reserves for shares and going public soon. I'm super interested in doing it cause I believe in the company's products and their potentially. They have many locations across the US, opening more, released multiple books and releasing another, and starting many other programs. I'm just not sure what to look for specifically before investing. I'll post a link or business name if allowed,. But I'm mainly just looking for advice on what to research before as their initial reserve requires at least 1,000 dollar investment."

This company has a lot of debt but has earnings and clientelle. It's future expansion does also hinge on the fundraising of whether it invests in paying off debt or expansion. 

Every early stage investment is risky. However everyone has a niche that they know well, so you being a bartender I'd trust ur gut if u think this has big potential. If ur ok never seeing ur 1000 for the foreseeable future I say go for it since early shares like this aren't really easy to get back.

Everyone's financial situation is different too so consider opportunity cost of losing 1000. I.e. if u stash that into S&P 500 and get 7% returns annually or use it as a DP on a house."

Mainly I think it would be a hugely valuable experience to invest in something you know well and believe in.

I think more importantly, you need to consider how much you can begin saving for investment every month, on top of what you've already saved. I would only invest once into this company you believe in, and take some time to really research what a good starting portfolio looks like for the remainder. I only started investing in the past couple months, so I'm certainly not expert, but everyone here will tell you get into an etf that tracks the market and invest most of your money into that, at least while you're learning strategy.

The real catalyst will be federal legislation that would allow the US companies to uplist to the NASDAQ.  This may take years but it could also happen in months.  My opinion is that it will happen sooner than later but it will definitely happen.  The longer it takes, the stronger the US companies get relative the Canadian companies.  By the time Canadian LP's are allowed to sell in the US, it will be too late for them to dominate.  In the short to medium term anything can happen."

2021-04-06 18:35:22,stocks,Interesting. Thanks.
2021-04-05 20:45:49,stocks,"Yea, I agree on your basic point of “people trade the rumor”.  I’m not implying that actual real world events should effect the market because I said so, rather than the stock performing based in people buying and selling the rumor.  I understand this.  

Moving past that, that does not mean that real world events don’t effect share prices. Even when the rumor was already well known.  Usually we see spikes in share prices based in solidification of rumors.  Another example of this would be in EV/ EV charging.  Rumors of gov investments in EV infrastructure and we see a spike. Biden releases plan showing investment in EV charging and share prices see significant increase.  This is  a similar scenario to the legalization of cannabis rumors becoming more solidified by legalization of major states.  Especially when it was somewhat unexpected timing.  

An understanding among most people buying these stocks is federal legalization is not necessarily right around the corner.  Could be 8 years before it happens, easily.  So you would assume big wins like this would have an effect on buying.

I understand I’m and idiot... so I don’t blame you for explaining basic generalizations to me. Your just misunderstanding what I am trying to say I think."
2021-04-05 22:31:10,stocks,"You arent an idiot, theoretically you are correct, the issue is its literally a casino gamble. In the rumour/news idiom, Do i want to wait untill the risk is 0 and the reward is capped or do i want to play the 50/50 odds when the reward might be doubling my money? That plays out in hundreds of different ways in regards to investments and trades. 

My personal opinion is everyone already expects legalization regionally and state to state to increase as the year goes on and have bought in already, the only thing that would act as a major catalyst is something like a federal bill being introduced or in this case rumoured to be introduced. 

It also depends on what specific company you are investing in. If its someone big with multi state locations and operations then they would benefit significantly from state legalization bills."

You start with $10, and you lose 10% each day for a week.

2. Day 2: $8.1
3. Day 3: $7.29
4. Day 4: $6.56
5. Day 5: $5.90

Next week, you gain 10% each day.

1. Day 6: $6.50
2. Day 7: $7.14
3. Day 8: $7.85
4. Day 9: $8.65
5. Day 10: $9.50

What may well be the case though if you're purely in the Red; is that you're not diversified enough.  If you're too heavily in Tech; you're going to be holding a while.  Look at the Sector Maps and see what's performing well and what isn't over several timeframes.

I'd also look at the Analyst Price Targets of your positions; if you're well above the price targets; you've probably gotten in too late."

Holding a LEAP that has fluctuated, and is pretty down, but everything else has recovered combined with the power of DCA (I continued to buy the entire way down on the things I believed in).

2021-04-06 12:27:50,stocks,"Just wait. If you’ve been buying the dip over the last few weeks, then you are doing great.

Tech moves up and down more violently than legacies. At the moment, Wall Street is rotating into consumer staples to reduce risk and leverage as a load of bubble red flags are coming to light. Give it a bit more time, and their focus will return to tech and insane growth will come.

Ask yourself, what the world will look like in 2-5 years, if it’s more tech/renewable energy focused, then why are you worrying. 

Don’t expect to instantly see green because you bought during a downward move, otherwise you are a God for perfectly timing the dip. As long as you hit somewhere on the downslope, just wait, it will bounce back and go right above."

2021-04-06 18:48:48,stocks,"A shift away from high growth stocks started approx 2-3 Months ago. As soon as the 10 yr treasury note started to uptick, and even a little bit beforehand in anticipation of this uptick, the cycle started. You will start to notice your high flyers rebound less and less each time the overall market dips and rebounds. The Nasdaq, Russell index, etc gets back to the same value but your stock doesn’t. This shift is NOT an opinion, it’s an unfortunate fact. Higher interest rates mean highly leveraged stocks, most typically small cap growth stocks, are affected the most. Smaller, growing companies usually have to borrow more money to help grow their businesses. A simplistic explanation...Higher interest rates means higher interest payments, means less profit. Sure there are companies that will continue to thrive and buck this trend. For other companies It may take years for their PPS to get back to the same PE ratios they were trading at just 2-3 mos ago. It is now a stock pickers market. With much Tougher sledding ahead. Keep in mind, if you are down 30-40% in a position. That company has to grow 60-80% for you to get back to even. It’s time to thoroughly examine your portfolio. It’s not a bad thing to take a loss and move on. It will help with your taxes. Most importantly, you can always buy it back (just remember “Wash Sale” rule). 
Some people might tell you to hold (diamond hands crap) and ride it out, etc. Just keep in mind it’s time (possibly years) you can’t get back. I prefer to always have my money working for me. I hope you find some of this information helpful. Good luck.

i’ve had some luck taking losses and buying options when those stocks are coming up to recoup a little quicker but it’s still dangerous especially with many of these stocks up 100-300 percent on the year.

also remember a stock going down 10 percent needs to go up 12-14 percent to recover fully.

2021-04-05 23:41:31,stocks,My spac portfolio is gone. It’s insane
2021-04-05 23:44:14,stocks,I’m just hoping to break even still. I need about another $500
2021-04-05 23:46:51,stocks,Shittiest feeling in trading. Sucks to see everyone else recovered but you’re still deep in the hole
2021-04-05 23:51:27,stocks,"Up about 2% today. CAT, MSFT, TM were my main players"
2021-04-05 23:51:51,stocks,"Yeah, I'm up 2.5% from the previous highs mid-February."
2021-04-05 23:52:28,stocks,"Wow I honestly had no idea, busy day so I didn’t track the markets had a great Green Day at 1.2% so I assumed it was a Green Day all around"
2021-04-05 23:53:43,stocks,Pretty sure there’s only one Green Day smh
2021-04-05 23:54:23,stocks,Theres been green days?? Are you from the future?
2021-04-05 23:55:10,stocks,"I will say, what concerns me is that as SPY was trading in the uncertain 390s range and liquidity was pulled from the market, a lot of sentiment was saying if SPY breaks 400, it will shoot for 420 quickly and then prepare for a larger correction. Well, small caps seem to have decoupled from indexes on the way up but still like to follow on the way down. I was hoping the 400 break would restore market confidence and encourage money to flow back into small caps. Hasn’t been the case yet. If that larger correction comes, I’m not sure how much more of a beating small caps and tech can even take, but I’m sure they’ll find a way to surprise me with new lows."
2021-04-05 23:57:22,stocks,I'm up 13.9% over the last 5 years and 50% over the last year.
2021-04-05 23:57:37,stocks,"I'm surprised how well $BLOK bounced back; past week it's gained over 10%, past month (even accounting for the late march dips) it's still up over 17%. Still in the red on $ARKK (though all the other ARK funds are green for me) down 5% even though I doubled my position at the 2nd resistance bottom. 

Disclosures: 30% of my portfolio is in ARKK and 15% is in BLOK"
2021-04-05 23:59:56,stocks,You guys got in the red?
2021-04-06 00:00:14,stocks,"not sure it's just you, but I'm well back in the green"
2021-04-06 00:01:57,stocks,FANG... oil prices...
2021-04-06 00:04:28,stocks,I could definitely use some good earnings and guidance
2021-04-06 00:04:40,stocks,I'm green overall but there are definitely stocks where I'm considerably in the red. Like 30%. And these are stocks I bought on the dip. The green days have made it better but still.  Then there's some tech stocks that just dip further in the red
2021-04-06 00:05:02,stocks,"Portfolio still down by 5% ish, but few Big greens inside."
2021-04-06 00:07:32,stocks,I feel you brother
2021-04-06 00:07:41,stocks,ADT Stonk has been treating me nicely. Good gains on greens 🥬. Small loss on reds.
2021-04-06 00:12:19,stocks,"I was red for a week, lost half of my gains in the month view, but now I'm back to all green two days. My strategy tends to stick with the safe bets and going in on notable drops after doing quick research on things. Though I must admit, I've lost some potential gains with a twitchy sell button."
2021-04-06 00:13:15,stocks,"my meme account is still in the red from a badly timed buy on $CRSR and bleeding from MSOS (im waiting for federal legalization), but my IRA is completely green. Slowly climbing back up there"
2021-04-06 00:18:57,stocks,"I mean kinda yes?

Fidelity still shows me totally in the red by like 2% but that's because I sold my RKT shares last month for like a +100% gain and Fidelity doesn't show total gains from sold shares on the main portfolio page like RH does.

So on paper I'm in the red but realistically I'm pretty deep green by like +15% or so."
2021-04-06 00:34:54,stocks,"I bought Peloton, Chegg, Chewy, and Nike after all those red days at the end of February. I guess I’m holding now."

2021-04-06 00:50:37,stocks,"Eh, I gave up day trading and I just use the sub for long terms. I trade on weeklies and I find I'm more green than red"
2021-04-06 00:51:03,stocks,I got back to even and then had it all undone today. Back to 5% down smh
2021-04-06 00:54:10,stocks,ICLN is still down quite a bit.

2021-04-06 01:15:05,stocks,My portfolio went green for the first time in months. But I'm still not back to where I was in late January. You're not alone.
2021-04-06 01:18:28,stocks,My portfolio is green after Easter weekend. I had entered on announcement of the first stimulus  for ggus then a week later for lnas. It was a hard ride I tell ya. I mixed oil in it too with OOO and that’s still down. Resources down. :/
2021-04-06 01:19:05,stocks,I’m a happy camper nice gains over the past week. And it’s great seeing thongs move in a positive direction once again. The only thing that hasn’t made it for me is Nokia and I’m not expecting a lot for the next 12-18 months so get used to $4.00 a share.
2021-04-06 01:20:04,stocks,"Without mentioning entry time, type of investment... how is this at all informative?"
2021-04-06 01:21:11,stocks,"My stuffs not moved at all. Still red, waiting for the crash or boom."
2021-04-06 01:28:22,stocks,Just recently moved to ARVL ... The EV industry seems to be not doing well huh ?
2021-04-06 01:29:18,stocks,I'm red but not terrible
2021-04-06 01:36:37,stocks,Nah man diamond hands keep going. I mean we all found the free money printer. If it’s too good to be true pitch a tent! 💰
2021-04-06 01:37:14,stocks,"I'm still in the deep red, but only because of Options in AMAZON!!!!

Now I know how Steppenwolf felt."

2021-04-06 01:43:01,stocks,"Me, still down by about 8%

My renewable energy etf and ark are lagging so much"
2021-04-06 01:43:22,stocks,Anything I bought in January/Feb is still red. Stuff I bought in Aug-Nov (WKHS excluded) is green. Overall 7% down.
2021-04-06 01:43:50,stocks,Doing ok because voo is most of my holding but wish CRSR would hit 45 again so I can sell out
2021-04-06 01:50:26,stocks,I'm down 6k since the start of the year still.
2021-04-06 01:54:56,stocks,"VOO is the only reason I'm not down more money. I came here to say you're not the only one. COMP and CHWY ruined what could have been a decent day for me.

Unfortunately I do have some FAANG but clearly not enough."
2021-04-06 02:02:52,stocks,I sold basically everything except Coke and I've seen nothing but green days lately. I'm over the risk of other stuff.
2021-04-06 02:09:35,stocks,"Just wait a little bit more... stonks only go up!  


For real, even oil that went south in negatives... unless you bet on something really really dumb, you shouldn't be worried.  


What are you deep shit into? what's your portfolio?"
2021-04-06 02:12:14,stocks,3 green days can’t save months of red 😂😂
2021-04-06 02:12:20,stocks,"I would say, if you are checking investments everyday you are doing it wrong. Unless you are attempting to be a trader you should not have to worry. Also, if you are worried, you most likely did not do your analytics on the stock chosen. Red is ok and is no reason to worry. Splits, dilution,  and insider sales are reason to worry."
2021-04-06 02:15:50,stocks,Sounds like your holding what everyone else is rotating away from?
2021-04-06 02:16:31,stocks,"I see so many of these posts, but why does it matter? You are in it for the long run, I assume, so the green will come.

I also see that a lot of people here invest a lot in ARK, which is a risky play so expect to get some downturn someday. Personally, I take less risk and are up 3%, but I also differentiatie with european ETF’s"
2021-04-06 02:22:15,stocks,What is green?
2021-04-06 02:43:53,stocks,I'm way down since putting up about 6K in some of the more talked about stocks from /r/stocks this past January.
2021-04-06 02:50:36,stocks,"Still -17% with ICLN, and probably for a longer time..."
2021-04-06 02:54:20,stocks,"Still red thanks to buying one new stock just before it lost over half of its value. I’ve averaged down a bit but won’t sink more money in for now - I still believe in the company and nothing has changed, but I don’t want to put more eggs in one basket. Everything else has almost recovered my losses from that one company - just calculated it and I’m only 2.2% down which is nice to know. I’m very new to all of this having started in Feb though 💁‍♀️"
2021-04-06 02:59:55,stocks,"The last few weeks made me reconsider if going all into small cap bio tech stocks was the best decision I could've made...

Now I'm pretty much bagholding, but once I break even I'll reconsider my strat and go for more large caps"
2021-04-06 03:08:54,stocks,I swear I bought into the dip a decent amount and somehow I am basically breaking even overall even though SPY is up at record highs and tech is mostly recovered.
2021-04-06 03:12:49,stocks,still - 20%
2021-04-06 03:15:30,stocks,Naw I’m to heavy in tech stocks to be green

2021-04-06 03:43:08,stocks,I mean I played with stocks that were riskier but yeah I'm still solidly in the red and underperforming many indexes currently.
2021-04-06 03:47:58,stocks,"My last 12 months I'm up 33%.    Five months ago I sent some money to an edward jones guy.    He put me in a nice mix of stocks that have done well.   They're up 12% in the last five months and are at an ath right now.

I'm doing okay personally."
2021-04-06 03:58:08,stocks,I got a bunch of cheap pharma stocks so I’m still down 25%

2021-04-06 04:16:21,stocks,Still 5% down but was 15% at one time so getting there
2021-04-06 04:18:07,stocks,"Still red because most investment was done in Feb - at the height of the market. I FOMO too much, still paying the price."
2021-04-06 04:18:31,stocks,I decided to join the stock market a week before the March corrections. I'm still in the red for everything I bought then.
2021-04-06 04:23:08,stocks,"Newbie here, still red. Would like to be buying more while it's low but don't have spare cash so I'm just sitting and waiting."
2021-04-06 04:24:59,stocks,"Eat like a bird, dump like an elephant. It’s always the same story. Plus it takes double to recover the plunge"
2021-04-06 04:32:52,stocks,"[Risk assets vs non risk assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp). Things that are ""non productive assets"" are considered risk assets like internet coins and penny stocks. They go up faster because they are riskier but they go down harder when shit hits the fan because they don't provide a dividend or buybacks but are valuable in a way. IMO we are on the knifes edge but i do think the risk rotation is back on again but you better like the things you hold. Some risk assets are better than others. Inflation benefits dividend and buyback stocks, a mix of deflation and inflation benefits tech stocks, deflation benefits the currency. Things like Tesla already grew 718% in less than a year and IMO its either going to go up with the S&P to stay in line in the list or it is going to down because it already used up all the of its potential gains until the company can issue dividends or buybacks. [https://companiesmarketcap.com/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/) the list matters more for individual stock picking."
2021-04-06 04:35:25,stocks,"My port is at an all time high, maybe you guys are all in on tech and/or bought at the peak in February?"

Rolls Royce I'm quite hopeful for, as they've been struggling hard throughout the pandemic but should see a huge boost in revenue once people start flying again as their main revenue stream is passenger jet engines and jet engine maintenance. 

EQTEC also quite hopeful for as they've just signed a 3 year contract with Toyota. 

Looking for some safer options like Microsoft that I can just continuously put money into each month. But also looking at some less safe options like Blackberry, HeliumOne and Kraken Robotics."

2021-04-06 08:15:41,stocks,"First deposit January 29 and down about 8% due to overbuying 1 particular speculative stock.  It was a good learning experience tho.

Edit - to add to this, a question for the seasoned investors here:  the aforementioned stock has dropped 30% and represents about 20% of my portfolio. It is not currently nor has ever been profitable.  It sends out positive news and press releases (making roads into Europe, etc. etc.) and it is ranked as a buy/strong buy on yahoo finance at the current price.  I suppose I wish I would have sold sooner and bought back in now.  Cut losses, hold, any thoughts?"
2021-04-06 08:19:55,stocks,"I’m asking in all seriousness, are those in the red new to the market? Asking as I have roughly 1.4 in market and probably 60 holdings. Two are in the red. One is down .42% and the other is BB. 

I’m no warren buffet but I have time on my side. HODL my friends. Don’t look at the short term despite it being fun. If you bought good companies they will get to green. If you didn’t buy good companies you’re gambling not investing."

2021-04-06 09:11:52,stocks,SPACs and memes went down so much it would take them going back up 30-50% for many of them to break even. The people doing well right now are the people who were in blue chips. Growth stocks are fun until the music stops
2021-04-06 09:12:15,stocks,"My 401k is aggressive tech mutual funds.   During the dip I got the 401k yearly match, and I continue to heavily contribute... (old guy playing catchup)

And even with all those additions... I am still down 4% from Feb 12th high."
2021-04-06 09:16:08,stocks,Redder than a baboons ass
2021-04-06 09:23:27,stocks,I’m in the red a bit for the year. There is some rotation occurring in the market. High flying tech stocks or funds cool off. That’s why you want to stay diversified.
2021-04-06 09:26:44,stocks,There’s been Green Day’s?
2021-04-06 09:30:09,stocks,We're at all time highs. How can you be sitting on losses unless you only brought tech back in February?
2021-04-06 09:30:28,stocks,"My portfolio went from +20% in february to around -3% in march and is back to +10-12% this month. But ngl the majority of that is thanks to VW, which I bought back in summer. The rest of my portfolio is solid red and seems to be still falling."
2021-04-06 09:30:29,stocks,Voo hits an all time high every week.
2021-04-06 09:30:32,stocks,"I was down around 7% overall, but held and i’m now only down 0.11%, woohoo lmao"

Red except for 2 stocks."
2021-04-06 09:32:48,stocks,I’m still in red unfortunately.  Down over 24%. It’s been almost 2 consecutive months now and I can’t catch a break. I could have sold when I made a profit but I didn’t.  Next time I’m definitely selling then buy back the dip. I’m hoping my portfolio will recover soon. Keep the faith.
2021-04-06 09:35:59,stocks,I'm up 5% from the past month. Up 230% from 3 months ago and up 270% from 6 months
2021-04-06 09:39:05,stocks,"Yup, been in the red since I started in Jan. Didn't buy anything too crazy. Mostly solid seeming, big, well known, tech companies that I thought would continue to slowly go up."
2021-04-06 09:41:24,stocks,"Depends on what you invested and most importantly when. You can make more money investing in dogshit funds at the right time than triple A rated at the wrong time. 

E.g, I’m down on Tesla currently, but I’ve made a fair amount on Pineapple Power. 🤷‍♂️"

2021-04-06 09:42:26,stocks,"If you’re down big you probably bought momentum names that already ran up 100+% in the last year. To be clear, returns like that in a year are abnormal. Many appear to be forgetting or are unaware that is not normal. They were long overdue to come back to earth a bit. 

Luckily, there are many of those names that have long term macro tailwinds and should pick growth back up over the next few years."
2021-04-06 09:43:08,stocks,"I bought a lot of ICLN at almost the tippy-ti-top but I heard we weren't even half way up. The red days were dildo-sized candles, the green ones in the micropenis range so I am still more than 20% down."

The reddest parts of my portfolio are the ARKs, CRSR, and PLTR. Thankfully these are a small part of my portfolio (<15%) but without these I would be solidly green. 

The greenest part of my portfolio is interestingly BRK-B followed by an S&P500 ETF..."
2021-04-06 10:06:33,stocks,"Like a lot of people, I got into the market when Covid hit.  Started with a couple stocks, read some books, and made decisions based on what I had learned.  I'm up to stocks in 20 different companies and have never dipped below what I originally invested.  With that being said, I was doing a hell of a lot better before I got involved with WSB.  Be careful where you get tips from and never trust someone else's DD. Do it yourself or deal with the consequences.  Oh, and diversify!"
2021-04-06 10:08:04,stocks,"The new investments seen on these forums (ARK) are bleeding.

My long standing ETF portfolio is green as fuck.

2021-04-06 10:33:38,stocks,Like the overall portfolio or one holding. It's ok if one goes red every once in a while.. I've never had my portfolio actually lose money so idk 🤷🏻

2021-04-06 11:34:10,stocks,What are you holding? I can buy some puts and help you out.
2021-04-06 11:55:00,stocks,"This is what happens when you take the mantra, ""BuT tHE mArKeT oNlY gOEs UP"" too seriously. Yes, it does, but it doesn't go up equally. If you're ploughing money into stocks (tech or otherwise) that have already risen significantly and sport forward P/E ratios of 40+, then you best be ready to absorb those significant down periods when sector rotation occurs and significant stagnant periods while the market waits for earnings growth to catch up with price.

I was up 9% in Feb and 6% in March while everyone here was screaming the sky was falling. Are those great gains? Not really. But I'm content with it. Remember, the stocks that shoot up 10, 20, 30%+ per month are just as equally risky on the flip side. That's the flip side you're feeling now.

Look for value, and not just the big names everyone goes for. Exxon, Intel, Viacom, Metlife, Volkswagen, Aflac, Lockheed Martin amongst others were all extremely undervalued plays that no one cared to look at because they were so busy with the ARKs, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFTs of the world that had already skyrocketed incredibly high (not to mention the crazy TSLA, NIO, AMC, and NIOs of the market).

This got way longer than expected. Point is: as long as I beat the S&P, I'll take a stable, balanced value-based portfolio any day over something high risk and speculative. Let's me sleep at night and keeps me sane in downtrends."
2021-04-06 12:07:11,stocks,"Diversify, diversify, diversify.

That's what my economics teacher taught me in high school. Still rings true to this day.

You are not the only one. I have a few mutual funds as a basis and I'm one of the idiots that decided that stocks were the way to go last year... and went $1500 into Charlotte's Web based on The Motley Fool. It tanked and has never recovered... I've been red on that.

FOMO'd GME at ATH and kept putting money into it as it went down... hyped up with dreams of rocketry. I just sold it last month at a total loss of $200... but it was a ""cheap"" and hard lesson. Started looking into tech... and everything's been going downhill. Yesterday was the FIRST day I saw gains on some of my picks... just to help reverse the trend. It was nice seeing I made $1000 in a day, but then remembered that I've LOST \~$3000, effectively reversing my gains with my mutual funds.

I'm glad I had my foundation of mutual funds; otherwise this would hurt so much more. But I'm hoping for massive gains when my picks finally rise over the course of a year or more.

I rightfully expected stocks to be risky and didn't invest in them when I was younger. I just didn't expect the emotional bear."
2021-04-06 12:08:25,stocks,"I don't know if it's all tech rn, MU, QS, and TSLA are still green today, which is balancing out my QCOM right now. QS very under rated tech company for chip manufacturing, much lower price point than a lot of other techies."

2021-04-06 12:54:19,stocks,"depends on your definition of red for my case. down slightly from mid february highs, but up huge from march 2020, and up a good amount from the beginning of 2021. a big part of that red is buying into a spike on expi (but even that hasn't been too bad because i've been getting huge covered call premiums on those shares which covers a large portion of the losses, and i long term i expect it to blow past those highs)

it's not like i'm a day trader trying to flip this stuff, so it's not really a big concern what it does in the short  term. it's not like red means i lose shares, so when it recovers and grows i'm still along for the ride."
2021-04-06 12:57:33,stocks,You guys need patience. You bought in January and are expecting gains now...? The market isn’t easy if you try to make money in the short term. It’s nearly guaranteed to make money in the mid to long term. Maybe it’s a good lesson to learn that you don’t put all your money in ARKK lol. Or any hot stock. There’s much better stable picks to make...
2021-04-06 12:58:56,stocks,What green days ?
2021-04-06 13:05:32,stocks,"Half of my portfolio is still in teh red, but I started it in January, shortly before the overall market fell. But I am for the longterm and dont really care that much yet."

2021-04-06 13:12:03,stocks,"I imagine you're loaded to the tits in meme stocks (or just the stuff that comes up in subs like this constantly), but hard to say unless you show us your holdings. I'm guessing you have a mini-ARK type portfolio."

2021-04-06 13:17:11,stocks,"Just remember that it's normal for stocks to go up and down. If the S&P went up just 1% almost every trading day, the yearly return would be insane. So don't expect that."

2021-04-06 14:12:16,stocks,Still in the red. Not as bad but I'm not smiling yet.
2021-04-06 14:31:24,stocks,A 50 % loss needs a 100% gain to break even

2021-04-06 16:09:20,stocks,"Only two positions are still in red

BABA priced at 250
BIDU priced at 240

2021-04-06 16:14:34,stocks,"How long a period are you talking about? I haven’t had anything in the red for quite some time (maybe a year or more?). I play very long though, like decades, rarely selling unless I do have a dog that appears and I want to offset some income, or if I want to flip some money into a retirement account (again, hiding some income to pull me below a particular tax bracket). The strategy has worked remarkably well, so I haven’t strayed from this approach. I do sometimes wonder if some shorter term positions would be worth it to try, but I haven’t done it yet."

2021-04-06 16:24:11,stocks,Almost out of the red with CRSR. Bought in around $37 initially. Watched it drop to $28. Bought more at $29-$31. My plan is to hold for 1-3 years so the red is just a color today but green will be my color when I sell. 10x potential and should be back in the 40s soon.
2021-04-06 17:05:36,stocks,Bought 199 more today at 10.15 after managing some money.

2021-04-05 23:50:40,stocks,what the fk do you expect? it soared 200-300% since covid crash. And... it seems like ppl here never do research on what they invest in. Look at the holdings..
2021-04-05 23:24:58,stocks,Because they hold a bunch of thinly traded tech. They are gonna be nasty if/when the tide goes out
2021-04-06 00:03:15,stocks,Arks too risky for me. I think that it's too risky and I can make better gains elsewhere. Ark is like a yolo etf to me and I don't expect previous gains to continue. *Some people are getting angry about what my definition of risk is. What I meant is risky for an etf that's consuming capital.

2021-04-06 08:33:30,stocks,One day it had 9% gain

2021-04-06 10:10:29,stocks,Sell it and buy a high quality index fund like VOO or VTI. Chasing performance and buying funds like ARK after massive run ups is painfully misguided. I wish more people knew about reversion to the mean and how incredibly difficult it is to beat the market in the long term.
2021-04-06 10:12:13,stocks,"I am 25% in TAN and ACES, as well as ARK. Me trying to be green in January. I have more secure Vanguard mutual funds that make up 70% of my portfolio. But this 30% got all my gains to negatives so quickly."

2021-04-05 20:55:52,stocks,yeah......lmao ive had a solid 2 months of red. a few random green days for SOME of my portfolio but nothing close to what ive lost
2021-04-05 22:32:22,stocks,"A lot of things going sideways, especially tech"
2021-04-05 20:50:11,stocks,I’m working on 6 red days in a row right now. March wasn’t very good as a whole either.
2021-04-06 00:50:46,stocks,I think what he means is we just had major green days into all time highs
2021-04-06 01:38:45,stocks,"I think this was my 3rd or 4th green day in a row, I’m not sure. I’ve had two months of red and used that time to average down as much as possible. Still a long way to go though, my portfolio is down around 10% instead of peak red, which was 25%."

2021-04-05 22:01:58,stocks,Haha! I meant market started to recover last week. Should have used better words.
2021-04-06 08:21:38,stocks,"It wasn't even a month and a half of red. There were plenty of green days in there too, some of which were very green. Like 4% green. The market just traded sideways, it didn't even drop meaningfully."
2021-04-06 02:42:47,stocks,"What!? Market is at all time high, you just made bad investments if you are still in red after end of a month rally."
2021-04-06 01:21:08,stocks,Lol he doesn't get the stock market.
2021-04-06 13:28:08,stocks,">What are you talking about? I've had like 3 in a row after a month and a half of red dude.

What are you talking about? I've had like 13 months in a row after 2 weeks of red dude.

What are you talking about? I've had like 12 years in a row after 1 weeks of red dude.

It's all a matter of perspective."

Holdings $2k down $220. Have to say $50 of what’s down is otc stocks that I planned to lose 100%. About $80 of what’s red is second round of buys and bad choices. Expecting to crush it on my recent buys. Had some decent profits and plan to grade my self on an annual basis."
2021-04-06 00:59:47,stocks,Same bro. You learn fast when you lose real money.
2021-04-06 06:00:26,stocks,Yeah in my first month or two everything I picked immediately tanked like magic. Took me a while to touch anything that wasn't investing everything I have in etfs. The very next single stock I invested in after that also immediately tanked and is still red. I'm beginning to think I'm just too fucking dumb to hand pick stocks. Nothing but broad global ETFs for this guy moving forward.
2021-04-06 07:48:17,stocks,"y’all gotta zoom out and realize you’re starting to invest at a literal unprecedented market peak. sure the market has fallen slightly since the beginning of the year but, again zoom out. it’s still extremely frothy out there. Stocks are so overpriced right now that finding a “good buy” is extremely difficult. 

TLDR: you’re buying at the top. just remember that when shit goes down. that’s when you’ll wish you still had some cash so you can buy!"

2021-04-06 11:54:50,stocks,"I've made so many bad decisions the last few months and learned so much at the same time. I feel thankful in a way because just starting out in such a volatile time taught me some very valuable lessons while they are still cheap to learn. I've lost a total of $600 in the last few months out of a starting amount of $5500 doing all kinds of stupid crap. Chasing stocks, selling at a loss after DCA because it kept losing, buying stocks that I thought would ""hedge"" against my losers only for those to tank too and then watch as the stocks I had just sold gain more than 6% a few days later that would have erased all losses. I'm comfortable with my portfolio now and have learned to leave it alone. Even gained a percent this week."

2021-04-06 08:11:35,stocks,oh fuck
2021-04-06 15:01:39,stocks,It's probably wise for anyone starting out in investing to match their wild hair buys with buys into index ETFs.
2021-04-06 16:33:46,stocks,I'd have lost half my profits if I'd done that 😥
2021-04-06 00:00:41,stocks,"I bought in right after ATH. I was down like 15%. At the bottom I switched over from a bunch of random tech stocks into long term stocks that were hit the hardest (EV stuff like nio and chargepoint, uranium stocks too). My 15% loss was made up in the last few market days, and I’m feeling optimistic about the future"

2021-04-06 01:10:59,stocks,This makes me feel better about my -13% 😂 All of the swings I was in never swung due to all of the meme stock fuckery happening simultaneously.
2021-04-06 03:14:27,stocks,"What time frame are we talking about anyway?

YTD or since you started investing?

I realise there are a lot of new people on here (I only starting investing in August myself), but personally with my pretty basic Smart Beta ETF-approach, this year has mostly been positive so far. Not a lot of growth but not a lot of drawdown.

My momentum and Emerging markets ETF have been doing badly in the last 3 months, but others have been going well so far this year.

Since August all of them are significantly in the green."

2021-04-06 11:57:02,stocks,Probably more like 60%-70%

2021-04-05 23:23:49,stocks,"only 100 deep, I need to start buying some covered calls to recoup, but all my money is tied up in other things.. that are also red..."
2021-04-06 03:39:27,stocks,"Depends on what you invested in. I have several SPACs / former SPACs and I'm not selling any of them. Granted the highest I allowed each of these positions to get was 1% with the exception of PLTR which I've bought on the way down (not down much with this one) and DKNG which I was up quite a bit and now am about breakeven. Quite a few of my SPACs are down close to 50%. 

I think if this has taught us anything it's confirmation of needing to have high conviction in what you hold. That and to not overweight yourself with high risk stocks (unless you can handle the swings). 

In many cases what's caused valuations to be cut in half are due to delveraging and FUD with interest rates and inflation, which will both remain low. These same companies are now far less risky. If you don't have the stomach or cash to average down then just hold on and do nothing. Again, that assumes the business itself has not fundamentally changed."
2021-04-05 23:48:32,stocks,Wow I feel so much better being down 1.7% YTD now. I’m sorry but that helped put that in prospective for me. Best of luck
2021-04-05 22:53:11,stocks,Down 8.34% after 2 months
2021-04-05 23:53:35,stocks,Thank you :)

2021-04-05 20:59:26,stocks,Same here. VTI is carrying. Bought ICLN at absolute peak.
2021-04-06 03:19:19,stocks,ICLN is probably tanking a lot of portfolios.
2021-04-06 03:26:52,stocks,I invested the same time and I'm up about 4%. Vanguard ETFs and Chevron have saved me. Im close to even on ARKs and lost the most on ICLN and PLTR. The meme stocks were doing great until they weren't.

2021-04-06 12:29:50,stocks,Thanks for commenting. I know there's no way to time the market but how to avoid buying at ATH right before a correction or crash?. Like right now I wanna buy QQQ but it rallied up so fast suddenly that I don't know what to do.
2021-04-05 21:50:40,stocks,I didn't get into TQQQ quite as low but I threw half my portfolio at it.  Up ~20% in a week is a nice change after 2 months getting beaten up
2021-04-06 01:26:24,stocks,P/E is worthless. If you really want to see if a company is over or undervalued learn how to do a DCF
2021-04-05 23:16:34,stocks,"Tech is the hardest thing to value by any metric. Your best bet for an established tech company is to check how their metrics are compared to previous time periods. For example, if company XYZ is at 40 P/E ratio right now but all of last year was at 20 P/E, its trading at too much of a premium. See what metric charts well against the stock price. I personally like price to book ratio, because you can’t bullshit it or financial book magic that number. If a stock is trading 30% below its median P/B ratio for the last couple years I’m buying if there is no bad news to change the future outlook. No system is fool proof obviously but it helps to try and explain the chaos that is the current market."

It’s not very much compared to most people have... but so far I’ve made a whole $15, lol.

So I’m just gonna keep doing what I’m doing and treating it like it’s my savings.  If I ever need the money it can come out, then."

2021-04-06 09:36:04,stocks,"Agreed.  I have been trading since around '98 and sh\*t weird right now.

Low interest rates, nowhere for money to go ... qualitive easing for years, trillion dollar government budgets for BS, on top of crazy deficit -- do politician even know where money comes from?  ... outsourced 'everything' not just tech jobs but manufacturing too ...

I mean what is market reality?  Perception is often indistinguishable from reality.  To go against the major flow is also a mistake, the trick as always is to anticipate when the market will again correct.

Frankly  I have no idea what comes next, but I do hope we will start seeing an end to wild swings for a while ... personally I am hoping for many flat days on major indices and blue chips at least.  That will be a good sign IMO."

2021-04-06 01:19:20,stocks,I mean it will come back eventually. If you bought at ATH anything will seem overpriced

Cath dumped it in Feb/March when it was tanking along with all her other holdings, but it's a solid company and up 12% on the week.

2021-04-06 02:18:08,stocks,"I'm with you.  The markets are literally ripping and have been for years (more so recently).  I don't even count the March 2020 blip as a correction because it didn't change the upward trend in the markets at all.  There are so many posts with people whining when like 7 of the 30 days in a month were red.  The S&P is going up like 5% every month and it's still not enough.  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills while I watch the markets rip seemingly with very little logic to back it up other than there is a lot of new money that is buying just for the sake of buying, regardless of the fundamentals or share price.  Perhaps it was the popularity of platforms like Robinhood that have made it extremely easy for the young adult masses to pile into the market."

2021-04-06 00:32:09,stocks,"Yes and no. For the older investors, new clueless investors are a certain sign of where the market is at for valuation. I.e if a large amount of people start investing in the short term it drives a bubble up. 

There are always new novice investors, but seeing this sub (which previously had a large amount of multi-year or decades investors) replaced by so many people who are somehow down on their portfolios strikes us older members as a very dramatic, easily identifiable change to this sub."
2021-04-06 03:11:52,stocks,"A couple things that helped me get through the first few weeks I started investing:

Don’t be discouraged by losing money. Learning what you did wrong and trying to avoid it in the future and repeating this will reliably return more money than any yolo move you see on Reddit could.

Also don’t get addicted to the gain porn. This is like fantasizing about winning the lottery. Just focus on yourself and how to make yourself a better investor.

Actually do research, scrolling r/stocks and r/wallstreetbets for tickers is fun and you’ll find some good picks every once in a while. But just setting up a screener and finding companies you believe in gives you confidence, and puts more power in your hands."

Unless there is a fundamental reason, such as legal findings or bankruptcy, the odds are the stock has been oversold. 

Of course you can follow the momentum but IMO one should never ever buy when the stock is on a green day. 

If you buy it when it’s on a red day, you’ve already avoided buying at the peak, because the peak was in the morning or yesterday"

2021-04-06 08:56:27,stocks,"Neuro, my concern isn't that tech stocks are bad. It is that the fund structure and volume is all wrong to invest in thin tech stocks. 

These are active etfs which have a couple tradeoffs. On the plus side, it trades all day on the exchange, and it has some minor tax efficiencies. On the negative side all of their trades are public knowledge as and before they occur, the management has no way to stop inflows of cash, and the management cannot directly perform trades, but instead have to go through a unit creation system. 

This is why despite being around for almost 30 years now active ETFs have always been a miniscule part of the market. This type of active investing should be done in a mutual fund, hedge fund, or SMA. Ark owns too much of the float such that it would be very difficult to exit many of their positions without incurring very large losses. 

I don't think small tech is bad at all. I think the fund structure and specific investment style of the management at Ark creates some scary tail risks in bear markets or crashes, and probably inflates short-run returns."

The large store departments across the country worked their asses off over the pandemic but aren't likely to be rewarded for it leading to poor sentiment.

He summarizes his sources. That timestamp is where he references the paper that researched how active fund managers with trailing high performance fared against active fund managers with poorer trailing performance. but you can look them up yourself as well here:

[https://jpm.pm-research.com/content/43/4/33](https://jpm.pm-research.com/content/43/4/33)

Exerpt from the guy quoting S&P research (different from the above paper):

""The semi annual S&P persistence scorecard lends further support. Of the 556 US Domestic equity funds that ranked in the top quartile in 2016, only nine of them (or 1.6% out of 25%) managed to remain top quartile through june 2020""

Same guy has a bunch of videos on why you shouldn't chase active funds. Quotes plenty of research.

&#x200B;

If you want different sources, there are other content creators that provide evidence of why you shouldn't chase active funds. E.g:

[https://youtu.be/6DVTGd\_tzUg?t=596](https://youtu.be/6DVTGd_tzUg?t=596)

&#x200B;

Point is:

* There's so many active fund managers that are lucky. Chasing managers that are lucky will usually net you a poor result if their recent performance is good, because their likely performance going forward is poor as the stocks they'd invested in (e.g. tesla in the case of arkk) is now much more expensive.
* As funds become bigger, they tend to do poorly. And past success makes funds bigger.
* There's very few active fund managers that are actually skillful. And it is almost impossible to identify active fund managers that are skillful (as opposed to lucky), especially before they become successful... When they become successful, there are MANY anecdotes of active fund managers who'd fallen from grace, but very few who'd kept up their performance. Keep in mind, even Warren Buffett has trailed the SP500 for 20 years.

Ofc, if you can find a way into the medallion fund, you can ignore all of these."

But that's trading territory, and if you go long a stock you'd have bought in even without a dip, the dip is just a nicer entry point for you and then you hold.

Some spikes are good profit opportunities though. Like that RKT rally, you can buy back in at pre dividend announcement prices."
2021-04-06 02:59:49,stocks,"> I feel like I'm taking crazy pills while I watch the markets rip seemingly with very little logic to back it up other than there is a lot of new money that is buying just for the sake of buying, regardless of the fundamentals or share price.  

You just explained the logic. There’s lots of money and nowhere for it to go.   
Thanks to the low interest rates in the US and Europe set by the Fed and ECB (European Central Bank), the two largest economies of the world are dumping mountains of cash into any semi-decent investment.   
Buying assets at inflated prices is still better than not buying any assets. The prices of assets might stay inflated for a long time and you’ll miss real growth if you shy away from investing now. It’s also a way to avoid inflation, which is a growing concern.  

> Perhaps it was the popularity of platforms like Robinhood that have made it extremely easy for the young adult masses to pile into the market.

2021-04-06 00:47:31,stocks,"I've been investing since 2006. Joined reddit 2.5 years back and this sub sometime along the way. I am among the new people on this sub but I can discuss fundamentals, technicals or options strategies with you all day long. 

Sometimes unexpected happens and you may have some losing positions for various reasons. You cannot judge someone's intelligence based on that. People have different strategies and outlook, and different interpretations of same event. Which is why someone sells at X price where someone else buys happily at that same X price. People have short positions while other may have long positions in the same stock. Also not everyone has same risk appetite. 

Point is, how long you have been on a sub is just a coincidence and doesnt make anyone superior or inferior. If these posts asking for help or discussing red portfolio are annoying, so are constant rants from some of the older members about quality of sub going down. Quality of a sub/community gows down when members stop helping each other and have a us vs them mentality."
2021-04-06 08:56:51,stocks,"Ok but these new investors are not jumping in because the market is flying high, they just got sucked in because something interesting was happening with GME. Who knows where they will put their money and how long they intend to hold it? 

I guess you could posit that new investors are just more likely to invest short term and try to make quick money, but most will quickly learn not to do that. If anything, the last two years have been driving volatility since you could have made money asking a toddler to pick stocks."

2021-04-06 03:29:11,stocks,"What nonsense is this? A broad market index fund returns on average 7,7% yearly which is a lot higher then inflation and certainly not nothing. You'll also get a free lesson that most traders underperform the market and that day trading is where over 90% of the participants lose money.



But sure, go ahead and ignore decades of research in favor of your own hubris. Ignore the latest credit suisse report as well which just confirms this. Chase individual stocks and think you'll best the market only to realize you'll do worse over 10 years time and lost countless hours."

The overall correction at the start feels normal looking back now, but I am thinking it has went too far the other way with these companies. Some are getting close to half there value being cash on hand alone. So if they get much lower I might have to do some crazy things."
2021-04-05 20:24:13,stocks,Yeah I totally hear ya. Hate being in the red when I want to exit. If it's year end then you can do tax loss harvesting to pull back some of the loss then rebuy after 31 days in the new year.

2021-04-05 23:35:59,stocks,"Oh for sure. Some techs are solid earners over time, others are straight up lottery tickets and should be traded accordingly. Management of the tech company is very key in evaluating it. Microsoft under Ballmer was a disaster, no vision, no finger on the pulse of the market and the stock traded accordingly. They changed over management and company outlook along with it and the stock shows the results. I’m bearish on Google due to their management, they make money only on advertising and they just gives up on any new product they try to roll out, they sure print a lot of money for now but for how much longer with antitrust in multiple countries circling around them like vultures. I don’t think the stock is going to zero or anything like that but I don’t see it outperforming the overall market. 

I would just transfer your TDA into Fidelity so you can get fractional shares. It’s a must for investing in established companies since they don’t really split as often anymore. Fidelity’s app and interface is a bit dated but its functionally complete. I like them because they have great support and wealth management on the phone, they are definitely there to help you whereas my experience with other firms is that they are just a platform and are only there for tech support."
2021-04-06 06:50:00,stocks,"The other thing is that index funds and ETF's are nowhere near as volatile as many individual stocks can be. And in case of a market downturn, having a few dividend paying ETF's provides somewhat of a buffer.

I tried investing in the mid 2000's and picked individual stocks. They were diversified and pretty well established companies and I still fell flat on my face. Not this time around."

ATH is not a rare magical moment, it’s literally the most common state of the stock market, because the stock market grows over time on average. 

It’s like climbing up a mountain, most of the time you’re climbing up and every once in a while it might go down a little, but only to get to the next peak which is higher.

That said, individual stocks can go down permanently, which is why any stock portfolio that contains significant life savings, should have a solid basis in a broadly diversified ETF."

2021-04-06 09:45:01,stocks,"I think it's smart to invest in way that you are comfortable. For me personally, it is investing a chunk in total market funds and dividend paying stocks and then having the comfort to invest the rest in a higher risk/reward plays, without feeling the need to panic sell/buy anything. The worst investment decisions I've made were such in which I had a strategy, but broke that strategy due to sudden events. Which only happened because I wasn't comfortable with my portfolio.

Some people don't want/need comfort or are comfortable with a vastly different portfolio, but I think the principle stands in general (for investing)."

If I could go back to me on the 6th of March 2020 when I initially opened my brokerage with a single stock tip, it would be to just buy SPY, even the 4/5 shares I could afford at the time.

2021-04-06 16:17:10,stocks,"so voo versus spy, voo has a lower mer, but its a negligible difference. 0.03 versus 0.09. not even half a %.

to be consistently profitable, either you started at the right time and the market went in your favor or you made bets and managed your risk appropriately.

why I prefer spy over voo is for the latter.

options allow you to reduce risk through hedging strategies and dca.

voo doesnt have that luxury.

for example, lets say you sell a put and get 2% in premium. Annualized thats 24% return. If the stock goes to zero you still get that 2%.

whereas if you just bought voo and it went to zero, you dont have that 2% cushion."

a bizarre example; you own the only phone in a village, the village is flourishing, best harvests of crops in years. Everyone has an abundance of 'stuff', so when they want to use your phone you can charge lots of 'stuff'. However, next year harvests are bad, and the village doesn't have much 'stuff', so the value you can charge for phone use is going to come down to match what the village can afford (because you gotta eat also).  

Just because TSLA hit 1k a share this year, doesn't mean it will hit that in the next couple years, it really depends how the rest of the world does. TSLA is the growth stock, it's where people put money at risk because they hope that in the future TSLA will be making big money, when times are a bit harder and the world perception isn't party time, then people tend to air on the side of caution and invest in safer stocks with lower PE ratios, with dividends and safety nets.

Some crashes take years to bounce back from, many people wanna avoid that drop so they can buy back in once it's bottomed and skip the years making up losses and use that time to earn more money instead.

It doesn't always work out but your average investor is very emotional. I had a coworker near retirement lose like 50% of his portfolio at the start of covid and I had to stop him from pulling it all out cause he was gonna pull out right at the bottom. Yikes."

2021-04-06 12:41:21,stocks,"> Investing in good companies after having done your DD is not gambling. I don't see how investing in SPY is seen as a safe bet but AAPL is seen as a ""dumb move""

When [91.6% of active funds underperform the SPY over a 15 year period](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html), imo it's a dumb move to bet on AAPL **instead** of the SPY.

1. Investing in AAPL: Picking a single stock (to outperform the market, which 91+% of pros can't do)
2. Investing in SPY: Investing in the whole market (which beats 91+% of pros)

> investing in SPY is seen as a safe bet but AAPL is seen as a ""dumb move"", when both are linked very heavily.

What do you mean by ""linked very heavily?"" AAPL is the largest holding of VOO at around ~6%, is that what you mean? People mainly invest in SPY because it mirrors the total market and provides lots of diversification (500+ companies!). Investing in AAPL is a single company and it doesn't do either of those things. TBH it really seems like you don't understand the basics, please do some research. As suggested by the sub sidebar, investopedia is an invaluable basic resource. https://www.investopedia.com/investing-essentials-4689754 literally only has one statement in its intro page:

> Investing requires saving money to invest, then developing a **diversified** portfolio. Portfolios need to be adjusted periodically based on life changes, but the focus should remain on the long term.

Idk if you literally google investing basics no one will tell you to hold a single stock, tbh not diversifying is just kinda dumb or a beginner mistake. it's a core idea of investing: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/about/sidebar. Sorry I know I'm kind of a dick but I've been fighting new AAPL fanboys for awhile who always seem to think index funds are stupid.

I'll leave you with this- when starting new, your objective should be to minimize your losses and taking smaller risks.

In a covered call, you buy 100 shares of a stock and sell 1 call at the same time at a higher price. Eg-

Say today BAC is at $40. And you were expecting stock to go up. And so you buy 100 shares.

But instead, you can buy 100 shares and sell a may 21st $45 call to receive a credit say $75. 

Now on 5/21 

A) if stock is say $38. You would've lost $200 by just holding but because you sold a call you lost only $125 (you got 75 premium right)

B) if stock is $44, you keep your 100 shares and made 475 profit. While without selling call you would've made only 400.

C) if stock is $47, your stock will be sold at $45, amd you'd make $575 on this overall transaction. Which is less than 700 that you could've made by just holding the stock. But even in this scenario you made great profit.

Point is, if you are going to hold stocks anyway, coverd calls is the best and  risk free way to dabble into options with high probability of winning."
2021-04-06 01:12:31,stocks,"Simply put, it means you already have the 100 shares per call you sell, not selling short. This would be selling a call. You receive the premium for the offering - if it never reaches the strike you just pocket the premium and repeat. If it reaches the strike and is executed, you sell at the contracted price.

ARK funds aren’t a bad investment based on the valuation of their holdings (most tech is overvalued based on P/E and PEG anyway), what would be a bad investment is putting a huge percentage of your portfolio in ARK and not diversifying in say...VOO or XLY/XLV/IWM, etc.

You don’t need 20 different ETFs, even just one or two ETFs can be enough.

I highly recommend the YouTube channel “Ben Felix” for some solid investment knowledge mostly centred around the idea of passive index investing, but he has also touched on factor investing, which is an interesting concept, imo.

Take your time with your research and don’t rush into things. You have decades of investing ahead of yourself, whether you invest now or in 6 months won’t make a huge difference."

2021-04-06 00:00:00,stocks,"How to profit from a market crash Hello, first post here.

Say I think the market is going to drop over the next 4 months. How would you gamble your money to best profit from that? Is there a specific company you would short because they stand to drop the most and the premium on the short is the lowest?

Any advice is really appreciated.

EDIT: A big thank you to this community for taking the time to educate me. I think by putting crash in the title, I triggered a lot of people. Saying ""short"" instead of ""puts"" also seemed to trigger a lot of people. 

I am sorry to waste your time, I think if I wrote it like this it would have gone over better.

""**Just theoretically**, if you were a long term bull investor, but one day you thought there was going to be an event that would cause the market to pull back 20%, and you thought it might happen in the next 5 months. How would you invest that money, so you are risking the least, but stand to make the most from it?""

The conclusion from the comments, suggest puts on inverse ETFs, but because the period of time is 5 months, then just buy the inverse ETF. But in the end you are stupid for even considering this. 

Thanks r/stocks you are a great"

2021-04-06 06:46:54,stocks,"Rule number #1 - Never short anything unless you do it by buying inexpensive put options.

Rule #2 - Historically, a large drop in stock prices is the best time to buy in (See the Coronavirus pandemic, 2008 Credit Crisis). What you want to do is focus on high quality companies that went down along with everything else, for no reason other than the current state of panic. I suggest big banks that are unlikely to fail (they were literally dubbed “too big to fail” by the US government in 2010). It’s hard to purchase stocks during these moments because not only is it scary, but you’ve likely already experienced a fair amount of unrealized losses, making it even more daunting. The thing to keep in mind is that in those moments, fortunes are made. I watched one of my colleagues buy Bank of America for $8 in 2009 (check the price today). He also grabbed Citibank for $5. Of course you have to be cautious, because businesses do fail, even large ones. But wait to see when they start turning around - that is the time to start buying, not before; wait for the bottom and then the rising action. These are general ideas to keep in mind during a crash, but above all Do Not Sell. Buy high quality companies at a discount,  hold them until they mature, you’ll do fine."
2021-04-05 20:04:20,stocks,"If you are truly bearish, I would say simply increase your cash position. If you take any equity position on a 4 month time-frame towards a pull-back, if you are wrong, you are destroying value. Even if the market simply trades sideways for a few months, you probably aren't making any profit.

I would increase your cash allocation and buy qqq or spy if/when the market pulls back. If you are really going to commit do your technical analysis and comeup with an entry point and as the market declines, start putting limit buy orders in around those levels.

Stocks are made to go up. Trying to time the market and profit from a short window of a decline is foolish. At best, if there are some down Friday trading days, buy an ATM spy put in the last 30min of trading, expiring the following Monday or Wednesday, with the intention of closing the position at or after the start of trade with hopes of a Monday follow through. 

The last few huge crashes came on Mondays after a down week of trading, including a very weak Friday. As in, no end of week bounce. 

TL;DR do not try to time a short position. Buy short term puts going into the weekend if Friday shows no bounce. Increase cash and prep to be able to buy when the pullback comes."

Many people buy calls on the vix to hedge their long positions, you would certainly profit in the event of a crash.

These don't have to be growth companies; a slower grower at a fantastic price can result in growth stock-like returns until the stock comes up to fair value, and the slower growers are usually less risky.   Calculate the intrinsic values of the companies then come up with dream prices that will give you fantastic returns.  Wait.  During the crash use limit orders to capture an extreme inter day price.  Maybe you get lucky with a few of the companies.  The stocks you do buy are good for abov

On the flip side, if you are wrong about the timing like most people who try to time it, you will miss out on even more gains.

2021-04-06 13:33:13,stocks,"I read ""the everything short"" looking at how Citadel has been shorting US treasury bonds into oblivion, and there are just a lot of things pointing to the imminent default of something big. [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the\_everything\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/)

If Citadel takes a hit on GME when it finally does close its position, I think the market will pull back heavily. So I'm going to buy some puts just to hedge. Also I think that I'll see a market crash at least once more in my lifetime, so I wanted to know what is the best multiplier. Like if there was something that had a x100 return I would buy that, vs just getting puts on Tesla (which I really dont want to do)."
2021-04-06 01:38:23,stocks,"It's when the dip you bought keeps on dipping, until you sold to cut your loss. That's where the crash bottoms out and will V shape recover back up as if the market is just inversing your decisions."

I mean, if you're planning on cashing out your gold or gold ETFs or mining stocks (whatever you hold) in the event of a crisis, then yes, it's probably not going to give you the best results.  I wouldn't view it as an emergency fund.

The way I view it is that, long-term, it's inflation protected.  Look at gold 30 years ago vs. gold today.  This is the benefit of gold, IMO.

The only thing I would add is that, in the unlikely event of hyperinflation, gold would be a wonderful short-term asset.  The downturns we have had have not been severe enough to warrant that.  If we go full Zimbabwe style, then you're going to want gold.  This isn't the main reason I like gold because I don't actually expect this, but hey, it's another benefit."
2021-04-06 07:10:41,stocks,Not the best inflation hedge but more of a hedge against decreasing interest rates.

If you buy Home Depot at a 330 billion, and your math has then hitting a market cap of 410 billion by 2022, then you should keep at least part of your position in the market, since whatever the market does between now and that date doesn’t matter (unless it changes the outlook on the company)

You already have faith in the company, why would you sell just because the market is going to be volatile? You can’t time the market, you have no idea what it’ll do. You’d be better off leaving your surefire winners in play, and having cash to add further to your positions. If you have some speculative or gambling plays, then it might be a good idea to reduce or close them. 

Yet again, you CANNOT time the market. It’s not possible, unless your JP Morgan with a billion dollars in quants and software. Dollar cost averaging down on sure winners is a great idea, as long as you’re sure they are still winners. Great companies at good prices is the goal."

I haven’t had the returns I expected in relation to SPY and my research suggests that you don’t buy and hold them.  Just google “leveraged etfs” and basically all of them tell you it’s a short term trade or hold not long term.

2021-04-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Investing in Nintendo from UK Hi, I am trying to invest in Nintendo from UK and it seems that there are several options, not sure which one is the best:

There is NTDOY which is an OTC traded ADR in US and it seems to be very liquid and I can access it via Interactive Brokers

There is NTOA in frankfurt (61 EUR last price) and NTO in Frankfurt (487.00 EUR last price) which don't seem to have too much volume, the prices seem to be in 0.5 EUR increments and I'm also not sure why there are two of them (I guess there are two different stock classes?) and I can access them via degiro.

Nintendo also issues dividents and I guess (but I'm not sure) they would be taxed less if they are issued from EU?

Any thoughts?"
2021-04-05 21:12:43,stocks,NTDOY is 1/8 of a full nintendo share. I'm in america and the other ticker I have seen in NTDOF which is the full share. I currently own NTDOY.
2021-04-06 07:55:53,stocks,"The ISIN is JP3756600007 for an original share. You have to take into account it's in JPY (Japanese Yen). Risk is - currently - minimal on f/x but it might be a factor when f/x markets go crazy or in case of any black swan events that might affect currencies but not shares directly.

I'd trade the ""orignal"", as it's a liquid instrument. Ie you should find sellers / buyers when you want to.

I disagree with someone on here posting ""liquidity doesn't matter"" because it absolutely does in case you have to sell on a pinch or just need to liquify for any reason."
2021-04-06 01:32:28,stocks,In Australia I can buy Nintendo directly (7974) through some brokers. I don't think there's much difference besides currency and liquidity. NTDOY is more liquid as you said.

2021-04-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Has this become the new normal? For a little background - I'm '18' years old, and since October, I've made a large effort to learn more about the stock market and investing in general. I would like to say that I am knowledgeable in the subject. I've learned and traded everything from fractional shares to butterfly spreads.

But as I think more and more about long term financial decisions, I've certainly noticed that I'm transitioning out of high-risk positions and more into growth stocks + tech ETFs. When I secure a stable job, my plan is to put half of it in an ETF, and keep the other half on standby to hedge against a potential upcoming market crash. 

And that got me thinking... Why am I so sure of an upcoming market crash? And not just that -- why am I sure it'll happen so soon? Surely, if a market crash happened, chances are it wouldn't dip down to it's 20 year lows when I bought it... 

I don't think people in the 50s-90s where expecting a crash imminently. So why am I? Does anyone else feel this way?"

2021-04-06 00:18:20,stocks,50% cash meaning in a bank account is not advisable right? You want a significant portion in the market? Because I’m in my early 20s and my way of seeing it is the money I put in the market is untouchable and the rest is for emergencies. Every once in a while I put money on drops but that’s it. I don’t know whether or not I have 50% in my bank account though

Genuine economic growth will almost certainly happen as a result of Covid restrictions being lifted. However, this process will bring about other long term risks to stocks. It's not necessarily true that stock prices will increase as a result of real economic growth.That's the most serious falsehood being promoted today.

It shook the market up a little bit. 

Anyway, amongst some of the big stocks they were leveraged into like Viacom and Discovery,  there was GSX Techedu. 

It was sitting around 90$ a share before the big sell off. I bought in thursday @32.33 while it now sits at $28.86. I'm down a thousand at the moment. Just worried I might have caught a falling knife here.

I don't mind holding if i think its value will go back up. The 52 week low is 27.06 from about a year ago before the stock started growing rapidly. There's speculation that a lot of their users on their education system were bots, upwards of 70%. Its been difficult for me to find more analysis on this company.

* **Synopsis**
   * US equities rallied Monday with S&P 500 and Dow both setting new record closes. Growth outperformed value, though both factors saw good gains. Consumer discretionary was the leader with travel and leisure names faring well. Communications services performed well with FB and GOOGL strength. Tech was boosted by AAPL and MSFT. Energy was the only sector lower on the day. Treasuries were mostly firmer led by the five year point of the curve after rates saw some upward pressure on Good Friday when equities were closed. 10s finished above 1.70% again. Dollar weakened vs both yen and euro. Gold finished fractionally higher. WTI crude ended down 4.6%.
   * **Market was largely supported by combination of upbeat recovery sentiment following better March employment data and fairly well behaved bond yields**. Nonfarm payrolls surged 916K, well above the 660K consensus, while net upward revisions to prior months totaled 156K. Economist takeaways were positive, highlighting the broad-based job creation, the room for further recovery over the next few months in the industries most adversely impacted by the pandemic and the lack of upward pressure on wages. Fits with broader reopening momentum seen in high-frequency indicators surrounding mobility, card spending, air travel and dining out.
   * **ISM services hit record high** in March. **Biden said not worried about a tax increase hurting economy** amid heightened debate about how to best fund infrastructure stimulus. **Manchin reiterated corporate tax rate should settle at 25%**, **not 28%**, and more money should come from high earners. **Yellen said US working with G20 on global minimum tax**. Also called on other nations to avoid pre-emptive fiscal tightening. **US vaccine outperformance continues** with seven-day average of 3M+ doses per day, seemingly overshadowing some concerns about a **potential fourth wave**. Multiple reports discussed **dampened momentum behind retail investors**.

      * **Consumer discretionary** led the market with strength from AMZN, auto names, and travel/leisure names (NCLH submitted plans to CDC for cruise resumptions). The megacap internets were stronger in **communication services**. MSFT and AAPL helped boost **tech**, with the semi space mostly higher as well. **Consumer staples** were a touch behind on food losses though good gains among drug stores, grocers, and beverages. **Industrials** trailed a bit though transports, A&D, and multis performed well. **Materials** **lagged somewhat with packaging performing well while precious metal miners lagged. Financials** lagged with banks mixed and tech lending lower. **Healthcare** was a relative underperformer. MedTech stocks were generally better but there was some scattered weakness in biotech and pharma. **Energy** was the only sector lower, with E&Ps and oil-services firms weaker alongside crude oil.
   * **Big beat for March payrolls:**
      * Nonfarm payrolls surged 916K in March, the biggest gain since last August and well above the 660K consensus. In addition, the net upward revision to prior months totaled 156K.

Average hourly earnings fell 0.1% m/m vs expectations for a 0.1% gain, with compositional changes flagged as an overhang. Economist takeaways were positive, highlighting the broad-based job creation (Goldman Sachs said industry breadth hit a 9-month high) and the further room for recovery over the next few months in the industries most adversely impacted by the pandemic. There was some discussion about a return to the pre-pandemic level of jobs by year-end.
   * **ISM non-manufacturing index posted record high:**
      * **ISM non-manufacturing index** for March soared to 63.7, beating 58.5 estimate and up from prior month 55.3. Highest reading in series history (from 1997).

Hi everyone, was thinking of parking about 10k in EPD for a year or two to collect the [$1.80 dividend](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/epd/dividend-history) currently trading around $22. Seems like a relatively stable stock with stable dividend to me. 

Is this a terrible idea or decent? Thanks in advance."
2021-04-05 20:47:33,stocks,"Split between EPD, NUSI, JEPI, and QYLD you’ll be fine."
2021-04-05 21:31:15,stocks,I have already been paid nicely with the dividends. I bought in March last year at a very good price and am excited about my dividend payments. I will hold this forever and let the dividends pay for my stock over ten years.
2021-04-05 22:11:05,stocks,"EPD is one of my favorite holdings. Great yield and safe payout, our natural gas assets are safe for the next decade. There will likely be some more expensive regulation for the industry, like methane release restrictions, but EPD is still undervalued and a great way to diversify a portfolio."

2021-04-05 20:01:20,stocks,Taxes are not that complicated for K1 corps. The K1s can be downloaded and imported directly into TurboTax.
2021-04-05 20:02:25,stocks,"Investing just for the dividend is a terrible idea. Researching because the dividend is nice, is a good idea."
2021-04-05 20:33:22,stocks,"In simple terms it is. The distributions reduce your cost basis, so you pay when you sell or if your cost basis reduces to $0. There are some other factors but that's the easy way to explain it."
2021-04-06 12:38:42,stocks,"I agree that they aren't crazy, crazy complicated, but for people who are used to (at most) handling broker 1099s, it's more complicated.  MLPs operate in multiple states (I think EPD is in 40 or so), and that also may create filing requirements in those states, depending on how much you invest and how that affects income in those states.  I do my taxes by hand, so I can't comment on how well TurboTax handles this, but after I discovered a built-in error in how TurboTax handled a specific foreign tax situation ten years ago, I look at programs like that as a solid way to make the process easier, but I'd still recommend fully understanding the tax implications so you can 1) plan out your investment scenarios and 2) check to make sure your tax prep software is handling your particular situation correctly.  While it's pretty unlikely there are errors in TurboTax, it's much more likely that information is inputted incorrectly by a user, so it's a good to have a rough idea of what the tax impact should be before pushing the ""file"" button.  Not that taxes should scare people away from these investments, people should just go into them eyes wide open."
2021-04-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 5, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 5, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Monday, continuing their strong performance from last Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recording fresh highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Biden’s recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

President Biden’s plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nation’s transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html). 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said, “ ""While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be “transitory,” yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative."" 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Gamestop (GME) sank after the company announced it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares. 
* Shares of Tesla gapped up more than 4% after the company reported better than expected March delivery numbers. Other EV companies also posted better-than-expected deliveries but didn’t rise nearly as much.
* Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during public remarks Monday that the U.S. Treasury Department was working with other major nations to agree on a global minimum corporate tax rate, which would disincentivize companies from seeking to locate to places with lower tax rates.""We’re working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom,"" Yellen said during virtual remarks with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.

2021-04-05 20:34:19,stocks,I wonder if the upcoming S&P Global Clean Energy Index expansion has anything to do with it. ETFs tracking that index is slated to offload and rebalance a number of companies. Maybe investors are front-running the expected changes.

2021-04-05 21:26:03,stocks,Yea I was thinking about holding off on my monthly ICLN allocation (think the index updates 4/19) but I honestly dont know what it's going to do after the update.

2021-04-05 20:05:28,stocks,My first option experience was like $750 to $4500 to $0.... Lesson learned about taking profit...
2021-04-05 22:07:45,stocks,"For sure the right trade. 30% profit is usually a good rule of thumb close for options (depending on other factors). In this case, you only have 11 DTE and it would be decaying rapidly if the underlying doesn’t move very much. 

The only times I’ve held options over 50% profit is if it was a very long DTE. Like when I bought 6-9 month calls on oil back in November. Held some for like 500% profit and sold w 30-45 DTE."
2021-04-05 21:17:13,stocks,I am tempted to take this leap and do my first options trade. Any advice? Besides don’t lose money 🤣..
2021-04-05 21:46:32,stocks,"Congrats. It feels good.. Profits good. Remember bulls and bears make money while pigs get slaughtered.

I have been trading options for a few weeks now after doing some studying,  reading, watching, etc. I have sold ""early"" a few times, but I made money that I didn't previously have, so I'm good. 

My goal is to buy low risk options and turn around and sell them for a 15-20% return. I then buy another option and use the returns to stack up my ETFs.

Maybe I could make more money on options, but it is a supplemental strategy and I'm getting comfortable.

Learn up your Greeks and do some studying. You'll be fine. Just manage your risk!"

2021-04-05 20:03:09,stocks,"The question I have is that I heard that you can potentially lose an unlimited amount of money with buying options and then selling them, if you don’t cover them (which from what I understand is buying the stock before or at the same time of the call purchase). Can anyone confirm or deny this? If so, how does that happen? Because that’s the only fear stopping me from taking my chances with purchasing calls/puts...can’t afford to buy 100 shares of most things...and don’t want to wake up one day and owe Robinhood thousands of dollars or worse.

2021-04-05 21:00:40,stocks,As someone who turned $18 into $200 on my first real call sale you saved yourself from expecting it to work like that. I’ve lost more than I’ve gained playing with options because I was too greedy thinking if I can make 1000% returns on my first one then surely I can do it again. I’m just learning the habit of taking profits when they are decent so that I don’t end up with $0 at the end

2021-04-05 21:19:52,stocks,"I mean yes, profit is all you’re looking for. However, if what you are pursuing is consistency, I would look back at the stock and try to understand what made you exit the trade when you did. Was there a sell signal? Did you simply not like the move or were you happy with gains? Being able to replicate a trade over and over again is extremely powerful."
2021-04-05 21:26:14,stocks,That's a really short expiration period. IMHO you got lucky and sold just at the right time.
2021-04-05 21:36:17,stocks,"If it was stocks, then yeah maybe holding would be the better choice. Depends on the company. That’s almost never gonna be the case with options, take your profits and gtfo lol.

What you can do if you are still very bullish on the stock is take your profit, wait for a dip and buy a further out call. Sell it for a modest profit again. Rinse and repeat."

You came out with a profit, so, aside from someone more experienced than me telling you about different strategies that could limit your losses, I think that the only right answer to this is to not have FOMO.

2021-04-05 22:27:17,stocks,"As someone who’s held calls in the option only for them to expire worthless, no it’s never bad to take profits. But you can miss out on a bunch so I get where you’re coming from. Maybe keep making small profits and add it up till you can buy more than just 1 contract and then when you’re in this situation again, you can sell some of the contracts when you’re in the money to claim some profits. Idk shit tho and I’m not a financial advisor"
2021-04-05 22:34:12,stocks,Never anything wrong with taking a profit. I’ve got greedy and held options too long hoping they keep running and then had them expire worthless so you came out very well

2021-04-05 23:39:31,stocks,Just remember profit is profit. You making 25% several times is better than making 2x once and losing it all 4 times. It shows your ability to pick up good stocks at the right time versus getting lucky and somehow diamond handing it.
2021-04-05 23:43:27,stocks,"With options you have to be right in 2 directions, price movement and time frame. Price movement is tough enough on it’s own. Something like 80% of all options expire worthless so be glad you made some loot."

I understand call and put options but don’t understand the numbers and things people say. I’m assuming 4/16 is the date but what’s the significance of that? And what does it mean to be a $10 call? Then how does the .80 come into the equation?

2021-04-06 02:54:10,stocks,"Good job on taking profit, but you did make a mistake.

The mistake you made is not when you sold. It was not deciding when to sell before you bought.  :)

Then you should stick to them."

2021-04-05 20:29:38,stocks,buying a call or put you're only losing the premium that the option costs if it expires before you sell. If you are selling naked calls or puts you could potentially lose an unlimited amount based on the stock price and if the buyer excercises the option. Best google it there are a ton of sites explaining it way better than I can.

2021-04-06 11:47:15,stocks,Yes.. options are extremely attractive because you see those potentials for huge magical endorphin exploding runs. But then you actually play options and you lose a lot at first Bc you have to learn how to strategize and play smart. But then even when you learn how you still lose Bc the game has suddenly changed and now you have to relearn everything. You’re always playing from behind. The chances of getting those monster returns are extremely slim. You have to literally hit a jackpot and you have to be unnervingly patient. You also have to be willing to make huge gambles. Most likely you’ll be losing a lot or you can play very smart and conservative and make slow modest gains

2021-04-05 20:05:36,stocks,"The market is unstable. 

The reopening trade is just a mirage.

Money flowed to the market because people didn't have anywhere else to put it and so they put it into risk assets (Seriously? Half a million for a graded Super Mario Brother's game? Come on. Lol.). 

Once they start spending the money on things like travel, movies, and concerts you'll see retail money flow out. As asset prices begin to weaken, people will tire and focus on the rat race again and enjoying their time out of work not worrying about stocks.

On the other side of the ledger money managers with access to cheap credit and lax credit risk managers levered up. This is real risk if asset prices start to stumble. Rising rates and inflation aren't great for company profits. Nor is it great for multiples.

I think ARK will be a target at some point. The sharks will eat each other if they have to. And since ARK keeps their trades out in the open, they have a big target on their back. A big juicy meal if a couple of their companies don't maintain and retail investors start cashing in to pay some bills. (Rent and mortgages have been free for a while, right? What happens when you don't want to sleep under a bridge and your landlord is calling for their money?)

At some point the party ends. The clock is broken so the best way to figure out when the party is over is to keep an eye on those with the wristwatches as they sneakily exit out the back door.

2021-04-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Dow, S&P 500 rally to records, boosted by strong economic data  

NEW YORK  (Reuters) -     U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, as a round of strong  economic data on the labor market and services sector buoyed investor  optimism for the economic reopening and a muted climb in the 10-year  U.S. Treasury yield kept inflation worries at bay.

An ISM survey for March showed a measure of U.S. services industry  activity jumped to a record high. The data followed Friday's report  showing U.S. nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs in March, trouncing  forecasts.  

Investors have bet on sectors poised to lead an economic reopening,  such as energy, financials and materials. A climbing yield on the  10-year U.S. Treasury note has dented appetite for technology stocks. 

Despite strong economic data, gains were led by sectors that have  underperformed recently, including communication services, consumer  discretionary and tech, as the 10-year yield remained below a 14-month  high hit last week.  

""One of the fears in March was that the rise in rates meant you need to take multiples down,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. 

""It's not the reopening trade at this point, it is higher interest  rates are here but not accelerating so the whole economy is being  lifted."" 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 385.96 points, or 1.16%, to  33,539.17, the S&P 500 gained 59.11 points, or 1.47%, to 4,078.98  and the Nasdaq Composite added 234.78 points, or 1.74%, to 13,714.89.

With speedy vaccinations and additional government stimulus helping  the S&P 500 and the Dow clinch all-time highs, focus now turns to  progress on a massive infrastructure plan and the upcoming corporate  earnings season.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still about 4% below its February high as  the recent spike in bond yields spurred inflation concerns and made  growth stocks less attractive.

Energy shares were the worst performing sector, following a sharp  drop in oil prices. Reopening plays gained, as the S&P 1500 airlines  index jumped 3.43% after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said fully vaccinated people can safely travel at ""low risk."" The  agency had held off for weeks on revising guidance that discouraged all  non-essential trips.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she was  working with G20 countries to agree on a global corporate minimum tax  rate to end a ""30-year race to the bottom on corporate tax rates."""

2021-04-06 02:16:00,stocks,"i'm personally very bullish on ad tech as digital ad spend will only increase over the years, as many reports have shown that advertisers/brands are moving more marketing spend from offline to online. (p.s i work in the ad tech related sector)

I would recommend you to Google and read up on **programmatic advertising**:  
*The use of automation in buying and selling of digital ad space*

in a very simplified way of explaining the ad tech (programmatic) ecosystem, there are 2 main sides: 1) Buy side 2) Sell side

**1) Buy side**  
Advertisers buy digital ads through **Demand Side Platforms (DSPs)** which represents the brands and marketing agencies that buy advertising inventory to market their products and services.  
Example DSPs: The Trade Desk $TTD

**2) Sell side**  
Publishers sell digital ads through **Sell Side platforms (SSPs)**  which represents the content publishers and app developers that sell that ad inventory to monetize their content and platforms.  
Example SSPs: Magnite $MNGI / Pubmatic $PUBM / Perion Network $PERI

**$MNGI**

MGNI is an industry leader. Magnite recently acquired SpotX which is one of the leading platforms shaping CTV and video advertising globally.  
Together, Magnite and SpotX will create the largest independent CTV and video advertising platform in the programmatic marketplace.  
If you're a long term investor, I would recommend long MGNI.

**$PUBM**

PUBM is the most generic of the various major Sell Side platforms (SSPs), and they are up against bigger & established competitors.  
If you're a short term trader, PUBM seems to have a higher beta (bigger swings) compared to the other adtech stocks.

**$PERI**

PERI has gone under the radar as its growth is slowly but steadily increasing with not much hype around the stock.  
ARK currently holds 1.33% weightage of PERI in their Israel Innovative Technology ETF (IZRL).

**$ROKU**

ROKU is more of a streaming play instead of pure adtech play, but as you mentioned they are trying to build an advertising moat for additional revenue streams.  
ROKU recently acquired Dataxu a demand-side platform (DSP) company that enables marketers to plan and buy video advertising campaigns.  
As an example, advertisers can use Dataxu to buy ads on Roku and retarget consumers on mobile and desktop."

2021-04-06 00:00:00,stocks,Stock vs leap option I’m bullish on Apple for the next few years. I was looking to buy a 130 strike leap for Jan 2023. It costs about $1900. At the moment that’s about how much I have in Apple shares. Would it be unwise to sell the shares to buy the leap? At the moment selling the apple shares would be the only way I can afford the option.
2021-04-05 20:36:25,stocks,"I prefer buying deep ITM LEAPs because the cost is lower. I have LEAPs for Mar 2023 at $65. This gives me 2:1 leverage (because I can buy 2 calls instead of 100 shares). The premium I pay is effectively the interest rate to borrow money for the extra 100 shares. It works out to well below 1% annualized interest to borrow around $12.5k.

For that $130 strike you would pay about 8% to borrow the money. And you would be leveraging up more like 6:1.

So deep ITM calls are lower leverage but the rate is much better."

Currently, the probability out of the money on AAPL230120C130 is 62.07%. This means that, mathematically, this call option has a 62 percent chance to expire out of the money.

You can also look at the delta of an option to estimate the probability it expires out of the money. The delta on this option is currently .55. 

You have to remember that 80+ percent of options expire worthless!

If you are looking to buy leaps on blue chips stocks, look for options that have a delta much closer to 1. These options will move nearly 1:1 with the share price and are much, much less likely to expire worthless."

The definitive growth stock of this century was up 2.65% over 18 months in a perfectly healthy economy. In relation to the $130 strike price, you paid a premium of almost 15%.

You very well could have made a profitable play here. Leaps on AAPL is a solid play, but you seem to be overly dismissive of how realistic the possible downside is.

Another thing worth keeping in mind is, they've already talked about stifled growth due to the chip shortage. Device manufacturers who use the chips to create their electronics are the most vulnerable, and AAPL epitomizes that description."

Do I think it is likely that AAPL will stay flat for 2 years? Personally, no. However, there are plenty of reasons a stock, even the bluest of blue chips, could stay flat or lose value over a 2 year period. Playing individual stocks is risky no matter how good the company is."

2021-04-05 20:46:26,stocks,There is a reason hedge funds short stocks (it's not so the stock can rise)...... GME was a fluke that caused a parabolic rise.

I can't afford to do any more right now. But from everything I have recently learned. I will be looking for the next company worthy of saving. This is a prime candidate! Primate. You see what I did there. Lol. In the meantime I'll wish you good luck and maybe I'll chat with you in a Petco forum somewhere down the road. Keep posting!"

&#x200B;

Can't compare priced of Amazon/Chewy to Petco or any other company. Both of these marketplaces are bottom basement feeders on products and barely make profits. Sellers on Amazon can't make anything unless they are the cheapest because consumers only buy cheap. Then Chewy hasn't even had 1 year of profitability since inception. Last quarter profits was the first and probably because people would pay anything to buy stuff last year online with minimal inventory to find anywhere and bunkered underneath their house like the Armageddon is coming.

BUT to have 1500 brick and mortar stores and still make the kind of $ they did, plus pay off some debt. Look at the numbers. It says it all. Chewy would have been bankrupt with 1500 store locations."

2021-04-05 23:12:37,stocks,"I appreciate the reply, especially the numbers honestly.
I would need to look at those and determine whether PetCo saw the increases from more than just pandemic related stuff.

I have no doubt they would like to pivot like Target did, but I def do not think of PetCo like Target. I know, ""ew PetCo"" I gotcha, but I've traveled around to see a lot of PetCos in my region and I can say Uniformly, that they were shit. Idk man, I just think it matters, however anecdotally, what you think a company is capable of. 

But maybe you could be right, and it's just business and PetCo can still have shitty aquatics but drums up more business through sheer numbers of pickup and the fact they might have more groomers and pet doctors of some kind.

I admit I tend to lean more towards ritsy trends for pets.
Wouldn't take my dog to be trained or groomed for the same reason I wouldn't go to Supercuts for the most part.

Never saw the appearance on CNBC, will have to check it out.

Also it still concerning to me that they bungled their e-commerce LiveAquaria project, but maybe they said fuck it and gave it up what I considered a good opportunity in favor and some kinda national turnaround."

It took some people far too long to figure it out.

LFS are like any other hobby store. As far as the difference, take something like RC cars - You can find some piece of shit on the shelf at Wal-Mart or wherever or to a speciality shop where they sell high quality, fast, wide variety of RC products with people to help you and discuss and have a culture surrounding the products.  The quality and depth of RC WalMart car to a shop that sells Traxxas or whatever -- that's a good comparison to PetCo to LFS.

Big stores - shitty conditions for fish, little to no help in the hobby whatsoever, bad non vetted products

LFS - the correct habitat not only for maintaining and selling fish, but also a hub of information and help."

By Tsvetana Paraskova - Apr 05, 2021, 12:00 PM CDT

The United States has made the first step toward harnessing the potential of wave energy, a powerful source of renewable energy which researchers have been studying for decades.   
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued last month a license for what would be the first commercial-scale, utility grid-connected wave energy test site in the United States.
Oregon State University received that license to build and operate the PacWave South testing facility as the industry is developing technology and devices potentially capable of harnessing the power of ocean waves.
Despite decades of studies, wave energy is still little developed—both in the U.S. and elsewhere—because researchers are still looking at ways to reconcile feasibility and costs in a complex marine environment.
In theory, the potential is enormous. In practice, wave energy will need a lot more testing and technology development if it hopes to become a viable renewable energy source.
Nevertheless, a testing facility operational by the middle of this decade could give the impetus the U.S. industry needs to test various technologies for generating electricity from waves and attract investors in the most promising technology. The Biden Administration’s support of renewable energy could also help with industry innovation.
The U.S. is one of the best places in the world for ocean wave energy generation, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Ocean waves have tremendous energy, and the theoretical annual energy potential of waves off the coasts of the United States is estimated to be as much as 2.64 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh). This equals around 64 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2019, the EIA says.Related: U.S. Oil Production Is About To Climb
The potential is there, and it is tremendous. Still, the industry now needs to test and possibly show that wave energy can make a difference with viable solutions in the drive for boosting renewable energy generation.
Oregon State University’s project leaders hope to obtain from FERC construction authorization for the PacWave South testing facility later this spring. Current timelines suggest that construction could begin this summer, and the facility could be operational by 2023, OSU says.
“We know there is still work to do to make this project a reality, but this is a huge moment for this project and for the industry as a whole,” Burke Hales, chief scientist for PacWave, said in a statement.
The World Energy Council estimates that 10 percent of the worldwide electricity demand could be met by harvesting ocean energy, OSU said.
The PacWave test facility could be the companies’ place to showcase technology in order to attract investors in their proposed developments, according to Hales.
“Even somebody like Bill Gates isn’t going to pay somebody millions of dollars to do tests that they think will fail,” Hales told Grist’s Ysabelle Kempe.
Innovation and testing of devices could unlock the tremendous energy potential of ocean waves, which is highest along the Pacific shorelines: California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, according to a recent study of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory funded by the Department of Energy. The study focuses on the technical resource—the proportion of the theoretical resource that can be captured using existing technology options.
The study found that utilizing just one-tenth of the technically available marine energy resources in the 50 states would equate to 5.7 percent of the current U.S. electricity generation, or enough energy to power 22 million homes. 
DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has identified “energy hotspots” of wave power along the Washington, Oregon, and California coasts.
“Wave power is a significant, sizeable resource,” marine coastal science advisor Simon Geerlofs says. Yet, he noted that wave energy still has challenges to overcome, including big hurdles like ensuring durability and efficiency of wave energy converters and cost-competitiveness with other energy resources. "

Same thing with the stock limits, I wouldn’t want AAPL to represent 50% of my portfolio. So it’s just a way to manage risk. 

Having said that, I agree with your analogy about finding good companies with solid financials, catalysts and valuation upside. Maybe I’m looking too much into the sector thing which forces me to make a decision. Appreciate the advice."
2021-04-06 10:10:32,stocks,"About tech companies: Looking back at the .com-bubble: The tech companies that failed were those worth billions with two engineers somewhere in a basement and never reported a profit. And ""solid ones"" were simply overpriced. Investing in the big tech companies today has imho also a lot to do with the price of a share: Apple costs like 2 trillions and they reported a net income of 70 billion for the last 12 months. In 2018 market cap was 700 billion and they reported 60 billion. The real value of a company will always be represented in the stock price, sooner or later.

Risk management has also to do with diversification, yes. But there are probably other risks you should consider, too. How do oil companies do in the future, considering law changes, for instance Scandinavian countries want to ban cars based on fossil fuels. What happens to a company during a recession?

Their vaccine just like J& J and Astra Zeneca does not have logistic issues so they will get easily distributed around the world and they have better efficacy than both of them so they are more desirable plus it’s only one jab.  Another is they planning to make a vaccine that can work on Flu and Covid altogether .

Everyone wants to buy failures these days lol.  Nvax is hard to convince people on but if youve done your DD its like the easiest money ever. I spent a while trying to convince ppl about nvax when it was 160 a share and no one bit and i event got called a pumper and hated on. So i gave up, fuck em i dont care if other people make money

Not even to mention the its up so much argument is so stupid when you consider it already gave up 50% of those gains, meaning it can go up 100% just to reach all time high. Current pricing is similar to before we had ANY data about if the vaccine worked. And people wanna say approval is priced in? Idiots falling for short hit articles and failing to read the real news articles

""Jp morgan released survey that its ripe to fall""
Funny how they release that survey AFTER the stock falls 50%..... funny how i bet you jp morgan is goin long on nvax and there wasnt as many shares as they wanted to buy so lets get shorts to sell it to us! Like... really... an article about shorting nvax, after its already down 50% and clearly beginning a turn around? Man if hedgies fall for those articles as easily as retail no wonder they under perform usually.
Funny how morgans price target is like double current pricing, but they released that article,which wasnt their own opiniom just a survey of what stocks wall street is shorting. Aka they made no suggestions and get to keep their ""credibility""as nvax skyrockets"

Basically there’s three steps to a target date fund:


1) Pick the date at which you’ll retire 


2) Buy that fund over and over 


3) Don’t sell 



If you can’t tell I mentioned not selling a lot of times and that’s because it’s important. If you sell during a crash, you’re only hurting yourself and your retirement.

They also have a lot of competition and I just don’t see people having brand loyalty with online better then with other product. From what I know all online betting services provide similar fees so draft kings is going to have to compete with very competitive pricing.

I don’t think draft kings is a bad company but I’m not convinced that they have any form of protection for holding their share of the online gambling sector on than them having good advertising. Other than that I don’t think it has a lot of upside potential in the next couple of years considering what it’s trading for now.

First I want to say that I don’t think customer in online gambling will be particularly loyal to whichever online bookie they use. I could be completely wrong on this and I’m only using my personal judgement and no research so take it as that but all online bookies do is provide a service to place a bet, I think if another company is offering a lower fee customers would not hesitate to move towards the company with the lower fee rather than the most popular company. 

I shouldn’t have said that they don’t have a moat because you’re right they do but when the company is selling for 25B and only have about 500 million in revenue and nonprofits (I understand they are growing but it’s important to look at the numbers to see their current position), I would want to see something more than just good marketing to establish them as the company that is going to dominate the online gambling market"

It's much like people moving out of California or NY because taxes are cheaper in other states and alows them to keep more of their money ... OR people with money moving out of US. They do now actually.

But to correct the record, Corporations are only taxed on foreign earnings in country where earned an secondly 
only when it's  brought back to US.  Being taxed on foreign earnings is simply a disincentive to bring it back to US where we would love for it to be used a home. Thus corporations keep it in countries where it is earned and they already pay taxes on it once.

Raising income tax and minimum wage, you have more people earning more money and feel like they have a better standard of living, you don’t have to worry about taxes. Make sure they know money is being used locally. 

Company’s would be happier paying people more money when they’re tax is less. Make a company tax directly to the amount of money there employees pay in income tax so you set a working goal of how much money you want to take from a company so let’s say 25%, you charge there total pay of 10000 employees 15% and then you charge the company 10% in competition tax.

China has expanded its economy and its military, they've also invested heavily in other Asian developing countries or even Africa. Theyre building for the future while US spend the last 4 years asking all old allies and trade partners to fuck off. Though USA has other problems, freedom of press has been falling and the democratic system is weakening. Its not as bad as China (thank God) but the development is worrying.

Instead they pay manufacturing fees, staff fees, property fees, then the best part they pay the patent owner or the rights holder what ever left. The right holder based somewhere we’re commercial tax is super low and then that company that you bought the product off pays 0 tax (except maybe VAT) cause it made no money on it product that it just sold. It’s parent company made the money which the company you bought the product owns 100% of the share of the rights holding company completing the how not to pay tax if your a company circle.

It's coming from the real world. The United States and Europe have imposed sanctions on Russia for its treatments of dissidents. Germany still wants oil, so it just ignores them. Now the US is faced with a choice, do we expand the sanctions to Germany for violating them, or just ignore it. The Biden administration has chosen to ignore it.

Market cap: $7.8 billion. The infrastructure package is solid, but if/when it translates into a boost to CHPT, and to what degree, remains very unknown. At a forward p/s above 53, it's already *really* pricey for a company operating deep in the red. 

It's worth holding for sure (65 shares here), but at that valuation, a loud fart in the board room could be all it takes to knock 5% off the share price."

2021-04-05 23:05:33,stocks,It's a solid re-opening play and their fundamentals are hard to argue with. The institutional support is pretty overwhelming for a recent IPO as well. I agree the charts have been average recently but it's a really strong long term hold imo
2021-04-06 00:56:54,stocks,what are the main risks of these?i know people say since they hold derivatives they’ll have to sell and lock in losses to pay for these which makes the bear parts much worse.still though looking at it it looks like if you hold long enough or buy daily that it will outperform the base index. what am i missing?
2021-04-05 20:36:42,stocks,are there instances where you can get stuck with the shares because there are no buyers tho? I feel like no one is going to buy a leveraged etf at the end of the day

2021-04-05 20:08:53,stocks,"because the stock price moves.  Just because it's in the money now does not mean it will stay that way.  And the volatility on GME means not only can it be out of the money quickly and by a lot, but the premiums are really high.  So if you lose, you lose a lot.  And since the premiums are so high, you could still be in the money and not make enough to cover the premiums.  Stocks with high volatility like that draw exorbitant premiums because the people selling the options are taking a huge risk and want to make a lot up front."
2021-04-05 20:25:42,stocks,could you give an example of how much a gme premium would cost as of close??
2021-04-06 10:19:22,stocks,wow. just checked on GME because I was curious.  The premium is the exact same as the stock strike price for months out.  Never seen that before.  So GME is at about $185 right now.  To buy calls or puts at 185 will also cost you 185 a share.  It's nuts.

2021-04-05 22:35:22,stocks,Alphabet is the parent company of Google
2021-04-05 21:03:24,stocks,"Ive written extensively on my opinion of the problems with the company. Its not hopeless, but its definitely not close to being good.

You see meaningless, cashless, and soft deals being showcased in the news, yet their core busimess has done nothing but falter for 3 years. Thats what ACTUAL research would have shown you.

A bunch of people bought this company due to hype and momentum. If you sit here to try and convince me otherwise, I'll walk away right now.

 They have some interesting prospects, but they fail to do anything with it. And as the years pass, its getting dimmer and dimmer.

 If it makes you feel better, I think BB wont make any more violent downward moves. The stupid, meaningless, and volatile spiking seems to finally be over. At worse, it will be a steady death spiral, leaving you time to figure out what you want to do next. At best, maybe they stop disappointing their investors for the first time in 10 years."
2021-04-05 21:12:07,stocks,"Unsubbed from WSB as well. Also, I know it’s like throwing a sausage down a hallway, but whenever I see a GME post from WSB on the front page of popular I downvote it."
2021-04-06 15:49:17,stocks,"Definitely.  Tesla’s battery/charging setup is by far the best.  

I underestimated your point for charging time.  Multiple sources cite charging time as the most important factor when deciding which EV to buy.

The only cars that come close and can use fast charging seem to be German luxury models.

Looking at the specs of the VW ID4, it still looks like a great option in lieu of a Tesla.  The VW hits 80% charge in 38 minutes compared to Tesla’s 20 minutes.  If they improve the battery + 500k fast charging stations are installed, people will adapt."

Correct but my original point was the infrastructure is not there yet for non Teslas. Most chargers the VW ID4 charge at are too slow and cannot reach the potential of the car. If you want to buy an EV today and need to take it out of town tomorrow Tesla is the only option. A few years from now that may be a different story.

Also, Just to explain how far behind VW is the software in that car. It still has a bug in it that warns you to get OIL changes.... They are repurposing ICE software for their EVs. Not the best approach IMO."

2021-04-05 23:44:04,stocks,"You're completely right. I found this out once by wanting to deactivate my account because Facebook was getting to toxic and bad for my mental health and when I tried getting into my Oculus menu it wouldn't let me play ANY games. I was wondering what could be wrong until I reactivated my account and immediately it worked. I thought this was kinda shitty and I think Facebook had a lawsuit on the matter already. 

Facebook is already a privacy nightmare and I try installing addons that make it harder for it to use my data to target me but you can only go so far."

As a kid I remember going to Six Flags and getting to play this FPS VR game and it blew my mind, you stepped onto a platform with a railing around your hips and put on a VR headset and had a gun and the game put you through a rail shooter, it was in the early 90's so really more of a novelty, but ever since I've been interested in VR (and later AR)  


Microsoft getting a military contract means this tech is going to going to get a huge boost in development and that's a great sign for things to come. By the time this contract is over the tech is probably going to be unrecognizable to todays standard"

Part of being blessed with a wealth or natural resources is actually defending those resources and using them in a sustainable fashion.  Countries only exits if they can enforce their borders otherwise they are just a bunch of people who may or may not be likeminded.   Economic sanctions are a joke.  Russia doesn’t care since the EU needs them more than they need US sanctions and China don’t give a shit about world opinion.  

You are extremely naive if you think anyone would stand up for us beyond the typical UN posturing bullshit.   At best the US would use the opportunity to setup a bunch of naval and air base on Canadian soil and turn us into a vassal state.

2021-04-05 23:30:41,stocks,"I'm a direct descendant of those people too. So is my wife. She is also descended from African slaves, and Jews fleeing Eastern European pogroms. I'm also descended from Scots who were kicked off their land by the English, and Irish who were starved by them, and of French Huguenots who were driven from France. Those people were descended from the Celts and Gauls driven from their land by Romans. 

My grandparents who picked cotton didn't choose to be born poor white farmers.

You're not special. Nothing exceptional happened in the Americas when the natives were conquered by Europeans. Natives who obtained guns and horses early used them to conquer tribes without guns and horses. 

It is a human event that has taken place countless times, in countless places, to countless people unknown to history.

2021-04-06 02:24:51,stocks,"Meh you’re still white lmao. You get all the privileges of being a white person. 

At the end of the day this society was never made to be a society for everyone. If it was, rights for women and POC wouldn’t have been a 100+ year long brutal struggle. It would’ve been quick and easy. ...  Better yet, there would’ve been no need to have any sort of revolution because the country could have not been a shitty awful place for people who aren’t white especially male especially rich.  

Motherfuckers died trying to end oppression in this country. People are STILL fighting for rights of black people...why the fuck is it a struggle if this is supposed to be a country of by and for the people? 

The country wasn’t built to NOT oppress. It very obviously wasn’t built to provide freedom and Liberty and justice for all. Just as North Korea isn’t a democracy. It’s called propaganda, double speak. Periodt. 

What’s the point of defending some old rich white dudes from 200 years ago exactly?  They committed atrocities. They were objectively bad people. Why defend them?  You have nothing to gain from it. Just acknowledge this country was started by shitty awful people and was always run by shitty awful people.

2021-04-06 01:46:22,stocks,"Where did I say anything about ""lead with shooting?"" Feel free to quote me.

What exactly is your claim, here, anyway? You have made some statements that represent the shallowest kind of thinking expressed on bumper stickers.

I am suggesting that control of the means of violence *is* power. It's like saying water is wet. It's neither good nor bad - it *is*.


 That can be political power - eg. monarchs and dictators rule by violence or the threat of violence, democracies use violence to enforce laws and protect their national interests - or a more raw expression of power - eg an abusive spouse who is stronger than their victim, a gang banger with a pistol in an illegal nightclub, or a mass murderer with a rifle in a grocery store.

 Our government, at every level from the federal to the city, is maintained by violence or the threat of violence. 

If I have a large party and my neighbor calls the cops, men or women with guns will come ask me to turn my music down. If I comply, great. If I were to tell them off, slam the door, and crank the music I may get my door kicked in or power shut off. If I object to cops, as state officials, to kicking my door in I can resist them or submit because I fear the violence they can use or I accept their near monopoly on the use of force as codified in our legal system. 

By all means, don't buy a gun. But don't dismiss reality. 

Unless I am understanding things all wrong. How do you suggest governments maintain authority? How do good people remain safe from the predations of others more willing to do harm for personal benefit?"

2021-04-06 10:59:23,stocks,">Political power comes from ballot boxes

That must be why the people in North Korea keep electing the Kim family, and why Saddam was constantly re-elected, and why the mullahs run Iran, and why Putin has done so well in Russia, and why the Taliban controls so much of Afghanistan. 

It also explains why European monarchies lasted so long and why the Ottoman Empire lasted for 900 years.

2021-04-06 16:33:44,stocks,"Question. Since OP is saying that his cash purchases are at $36 a share and his margin purchases are at $32, and the stock is trading at $35 right now, does that mean even if he's green overall he can sell the $36 per share ones to cancel the margin as well as take a loss for taxes?

I'm just trying to better understand the system."
2021-04-06 16:37:22,stocks,"All margin cares about is cash. It doesn’t care which shares were bought with which money. If you were to add cash to cover the margin, then you’re set. If you sell any shares, regardless of purchase price, and sell enough to get a dollar amount that covers margin, then you are set. 

Now, separate discussion is taxes. TD Ameritrade allows you to chose which shares you sell (based on purchase price). I’m sure other brokerages are the same.

You clearly have done absolutely no meaningful research on FB. I'm done responding to you after this; I'm basically teaching you basics about FB at this point. Your understanding of what FB's business model is hilariously misinformed. The users are NOT the customers. The users form the network and the network is the product; the network NEEDS to be mature for it to work and the fact that its mature in some areas while other areas are untapped leaves tons of room for growth. The fact that the network is saturated in America and Europe is what gives FB its enormous moat. There is no platform on Earth with the amount of social penetrance that FB has; this is why if you do not advertise on FB or IG, you are throwing money down the drain. Their ads not only reach damn near everybody, they've collected so much data on their users that they probably know more about your consumer habits than your own family. As a result, the return on ad spend is far superior to any platform outside of maybe Google. Think about how much FUD there is about FB and Zuck in recent years and look at how much money they continue to make/how their growth is unstoppable in spite of all this. The value proposition of running ads on FB's platforms is simply too high and the stronger the network gets, the higher that value proposition becomes. If you don't want to invest in FB because of morals, fine. Your bear argument has been based on nothing factual and everything you've said can be refuted by just looking at their 10Ks and 10Qs, something you clearly have not done. Good luck with your investing endeavors and have fun paying taxes on your dividends."

2021-04-05 21:43:37,stocks,"Effectively none. Buying 10 shares of SPY is 1 ""share"" of S&P 500.

10900K is still the better processor for enthusiasts. 11900K shouldn't exist, it's basically a worse 5800X for like $200 more

If 11900K was priced the same as the 5800x it would be a decent launch. I don't really like how they limited TVB to i9 when even the 5600x will boost to the max the silicon will allow.

11400F is a good processor, I just wish they had TVB on it because it's locked so there's no way to get the higher frequency outside of boosting

That's my problem with Intel, they make good products, but artificially segment them. Although with b560 and 11400F I think you get a good value anyway since the boost is quite high and you get a 6 core processor that's decent in productivity as well.

I like how open Steve is with investors and really does put investors at the top of his list. 
What I gather, Steve had just realigned the finances in AITX.
Steve was just starting a pipe line of revenue as I got in. It’s hard to invest in a come thats negative. While there where NDAs with some of these customers, it seem promising. 
The rad army was also a key part of it. 
While SO was a risk to me. The structure or the foundation of the company was well established (still being established). 
I also liked how Steve made sure to keep up to date on his sec reporting. 

I started investing as low as .0025 as I was doing my dd. Wish I dumped my money into it from the start or as much as I have. I’d be a millionaire. Always do your dd before investing or it may hurt. 

As far as the product it’s self. We all know people want to cut cost. First place they start is the worker. My little brother works in security. I have a friend who use to be a sheriff. Both agree it’s coming. If you can find the right company, it will pay off. I strongly believe AITX is that company compared to others who are looking to get into the industry."

2021-04-06 15:50:40,stocks,"I don't like to bifurcate them like that because it is not as if interest rates go up and inflation stays flat and vice versa. The trend seems to have trended in the following pattern: negative inflation (cpi reports from last Mar - May) followed by lower interest rates which corresponded with higher inflation (1st stimulus and fed lowering interest rate response) > somewhat flat through August > interest rate rise with inflation (Aug - Dec) > inflation outpaces interest (2nd stimulus) > etc. 

As you can see, it's been this tug-of-war with both going up and down. Of course it will fit your narrative if you fix one of the variables and increase the other, but I would recommend exercising caution in linear thinking because it can leave you blind to other factors."
