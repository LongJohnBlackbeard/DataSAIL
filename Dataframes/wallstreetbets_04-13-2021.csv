2021-04-13 19:22:15,wallstreetbets,Expire this Friday. You lucky son of a bitch
2021-04-13 19:21:30,wallstreetbets,"At $30 it’s nowhere near 20X return 

More like 4X if it hits $30 tomorrow.

EDIT: my bad looked at wrong column. Looks like cost was more like $1700 so you’d get a nice return for sure."
2021-04-13 19:07:58,wallstreetbets,"Bought beginning April 1st. 

Planning to ride through double click, I’m very bullish and expect $27.50 tomorrow minimum, could run into $30’s.

It’s a very very small bet for me, but could be 20x+"
2021-04-13 19:44:39,wallstreetbets,Not yet
2021-04-13 19:40:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you realize the $26 calls are purchased at $0.13775? Strong math.

$1 increase is a 6x after $26 lol."
2021-04-13 19:09:01,wallstreetbets,Too bad this shit goes down if news is remotely positive.

Strong reading comprehension."
2021-04-13 19:10:23,wallstreetbets,Double click is different. It will launch tomorrow.
2021-04-13 19:11:34,wallstreetbets,"$1,700 roughly."
2021-04-13 19:11:12,wallstreetbets,I got shares so sure. 🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-13 19:21:07,wallstreetbets,Sorry but... You call that a YOLO?
2021-04-13 19:12:14,wallstreetbets,"Yup, 100% of my IRA is in PLTR @ $9.xx lol"
2021-04-13 19:22:58,wallstreetbets,If $1700 is nothing why don’t u send me $1700
2021-04-13 19:13:23,wallstreetbets,Haha ye went like 40% on it in the 9s in my roth.
2021-04-13 19:32:29,wallstreetbets,"I am not saying that 1700$ is nothing. It can hurt... yes. But still not a YOLO

and less when you say a couple of comments above

>Yup, 100% of my IRA is in PLTR @ $9.xx lol"
2021-04-13 19:13:48,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-04-13 19:42:26,wallstreetbets,"Lol, it’s in a 6 figure IRA.

This is just a play money account that also has PLTR shares lmao."
2021-04-13 19:53:09,wallstreetbets,">This is just a play money account that also has PLTR shares lmao.

So... 1700$ not a YOLO?"
2021-04-13 19:53:41,wallstreetbets,"It could be a $40k return.

It’s a yolo with low risk."
2021-04-13 19:06:51,wallstreetbets,What’s the current Bloomberg Terminal say on institutional ownership?
2021-04-13 19:36:36,wallstreetbets,the real question is why did fidelity keep 87 shares?
2021-04-13 19:59:28,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-13 18:59:50,wallstreetbets,bro bloomberg terminal is only 24k a year so I don‘t think it‘s credible enough
2021-04-13 19:01:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah that numbers fucked. It’s a shame how difficult it is for retail to get accurate and timely information that isn’t just the ticket price and fud articles
2021-04-13 19:44:51,wallstreetbets,I feel like this is pretty common knowledge for anyone that regularly keeps up with the DD. Institutional ownership is still greater than 100% tho. It's always good to get opposing views though because echo chambers are dangerous.
2021-04-13 19:01:02,wallstreetbets,"Great work, following"
2021-04-13 19:34:16,wallstreetbets,"This is correct. FINRA is pulling the data from Morningstar and maybe some other sources. It’s double and triple counting because it’s counting both dates 12/31 and 3/31 for example (it has to be one or the other) and obviously there’s that Fidelity entry two times.

Important to note, that’s not an “official FINRA” website it’s pulling data from Morningstar. For the holdings it’s feed is obviously fucked up. This is also why it’s short interest % used to be different than other sources- it was using Morningstar’s float calculation which is Incorrect.

It does suck that there’s no accurate site for this data for retail. 

But, NOBODY has accurate holdings data. 13fs are filed 45 days after the end of the quarter. It doesn’t matter if you have Bloomberg (I do), the holdings are still mostly as of 12/31."

2. The blackrocks are different entities in fact one is the subsidiary that owns shares in the corporate parent
3. The Fidelity’s are corporate entities as well. I believe it is FMR for the parent followed by the research and then the research LLC which runs the foreign LLcs. Yes those companies and their relationships are all listed in their organization holdings and associated docs. I had done a larger explanation on Sunday. This is a quick reclama. Basically. What you see on that corporate GME site is a no shit audited hang my auditor ass out to dry document"
2021-04-13 19:29:11,wallstreetbets,"This will likely get downvoted, but great work.

2021-04-13 19:07:23,wallstreetbets,"If you comment like this, you haven't read the post but only the conclusions. All the claims you made are answered in the post. Just read and UNDERSTAND."
2021-04-13 19:35:16,wallstreetbets,"This isn't a conspiracy. These are just automatically generated summaries from public filings.

In my M&A group, we frequently pull tables like this from FactSet to show similar ownership between companies (e.g. if the same funds own Company A and Company B, they'd probably be inclined to accept a merger with stock as the consideration, since they obviously like both companies already). You have to rub together a couple brain cells to scrub the data and eliminate obvious duplicates, but it's not hard... though these websites or even data services like FactSet and Bloomberg aren't going to devote humans to doing it for every public company in existence."
2021-04-13 19:18:26,wallstreetbets,Do you think this is closer to the real value? I am long on GME but skeptical of the 192% mostly for filing date purposes like you mentioned.
2021-04-13 19:04:13,wallstreetbets,I own GME shares but I don't like misinformation.

2021-04-13 19:18:58,wallstreetbets,I did go through it. Yes. I am not sure about the filings. Yes they are separate entities but I would love to work it back through the financials. Truth in lending I am not sure regarding the filings at all and defer to you on those
2021-04-13 19:12:52,wallstreetbets,It’s about four posts below this. Starts with Ymmv. Kinda long analysis like yours
2021-04-13 19:11:14,wallstreetbets,I just posted a more nuanced opinion which used finra data. But hey we’re all trying to understand. The second more nuanced opinion shows the corporate governance that allows them to move shares
2021-04-13 19:43:28,wallstreetbets,"I understand that these are automatically generated. I’m not calling the data summary a conspiracy at all.

The “intentional and malicious” part is how people have been using this bad information to mislead others and/or confirm their own biases. In many of the GME threads, it’s impossible to point out irregularities in data like this because it goes against the hive mind. 

On the other hand, data that is antithetical to their thesis will be picked apart, flipped upside down and rearranged until it *does* fit their thesis."
2021-04-13 19:57:01,wallstreetbets,I’d say the BT % is the closest us plebs can get to a correct number but even the BT has dated info. There’s not a doubt in my mind BT>Finra though.
2021-04-13 19:26:00,wallstreetbets,I have 795 deep under water and I agree 100%.
2021-04-13 19:53:41,wallstreetbets,Sorry I didn't mean to be rude. I left the double Blackrock explanation because it's the same as the one for Fidelity so it was subtextual and you can check it yourself.
2021-04-13 19:26:28,wallstreetbets,">I did go through it. Yes. I am not sure about the filings. Yes they are separate entities but I would love to work it back through the financials. Truth in lending I am not sure regarding the filings at all and defer to you on those

Ok I'm glad you read. Then I tell you that if you think they are separate entities just compare the C - I - K (I write it like that because the word is banned) and above all find the Filing of the SEC. I have already checked because at the beginning of the research I had the doubt too. If you find me 13F, G,D with different C - I - K's for each company, I'm ready to change my mind."
2021-04-13 19:45:21,wallstreetbets,"Ah okay, in that case we are in total agreement."
2021-04-13 19:35:21,wallstreetbets,No. I’ll start look at those forbidden words as well. I mean I started looking at the corporate entities and then the questions about threshold reporting. Are they different because a LLC may be foreign vice deleware based. My brain hurts looking at them. You did a great job by the way
2021-04-13 19:46:36,wallstreetbets,"Look if you want to understand right away what I mean in the thread read this comment and response.

2021-04-13 19:12:47,wallstreetbets,"You convinced me, [$190 prediction it is.](https://www.factionfinancial.com/prediction/30ff9eab-4477-47c7-8457-2aee19e86609)

At best it’s a gauge to see how many are gone from that one place, but doesn’t tell us much more than that"
2021-04-13 19:52:04,wallstreetbets,Somewhere (in WSB) I read that when a company pays dividends that the shorts have to pay them.... is that true?? And why haven’t the shirts been paying the gme dividend?? Very dumb. Please excuse.

2021-04-13 19:38:08,wallstreetbets,"If the stock is over 100% shorted, that would mean they would need 70 million shares to cover, and that isn’t taking into account any synthetic shares. The 3.5 million is a drop in the ocean and nothing to do with that.

In fact GME are as good as saying they want to sell as high as possible, using as few as possible shares to get their $1 billion. They are alll aboard the rocket"
2021-04-13 19:42:22,wallstreetbets,"So you’re telling me that hedgies are going to buy 3.5 millions shares at +$140 each when they bet that the shares would go next to bankrupt? 

They aren’t buying any shares. That is the whole point of this entire situation. They bought puts, thinking they could bankrupt the company along the way and a few smart people caught on and retail blew this shit up. 

THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BUY AT ANY PRICE OVER $1."

2021-04-13 18:43:59,wallstreetbets,"On Monday, I bought 4x $24 4/16 calls for $57 a piece. I came damn close to tripling my investment today.  I nearly cashed out, too, as I'm so tired of losing money and not making any. But I took a deep breath, and reminded myself, Double-Click hasn't even happened yet.   


I'm going to be so bummed if the stock falls tomorrow.  


PS. I actually have a lot more invested in Palantir, but those were just the calls I bought Monday, with whatever extra money I could scrounge up last minute. :D"

2021-04-13 17:36:36,wallstreetbets," Started in November with $20k, all visible in my profile. Current cost average is actually around $40 and not as high as shown, but sold and rebought a familiar pattern in early march.

&#x200B;

It's ridiculous how the stock hasn't reacted at all to the great news as of late. Cohen as chairman, plus search for a new CEO. No negative news at all, all the DD still stands. Seen all that stuff before, holding has never been easier.

&#x200B;

People used to draw the VW squeeze comparison, but I disagree. If you want to compare squeezes, compare to TSLA. Long, drawn out, and to ridiculous heights. The institutions in short positions are too stubborn and have too much liquidity to get squeezed out in one short blast. The VW squeeze had an element of surprise, which is missing with GME. But when all the fundamentals keep getting better and better and it gets clear the stock isn't going anywhere back to where it was, shorts will get closed. Slowly, with new shorts being opened on the way, but they will. Also way better scenario for the stock in my opinion. Compare 2008 VW chart to 2020-2021 TSLA chart and pick what you would rather own."

2021-04-13 18:05:55,wallstreetbets,No offense but gme should be trading below $20. The only reason it's this high is because everyone go together and bought gme at the first good news they heard in order to screw over the hedge funders. Right now they're just continuing that so I don't think good news is going to affect the stock price at all and it's just people throwing money at it and the gamblers who don't know any better

Just my personal current opinion ofc, what the fuck do I know."

2021-04-13 17:38:30,wallstreetbets,I bought 420c for 4/21.  The stars are aligned

2021-04-13 17:24:05,wallstreetbets,I closed out my puts yesterday. I understand spy is on a cocaine bender but there isn’t any confirmation that we are ready to pullback. Puts could work if they are out like yours.
2021-04-13 19:11:08,wallstreetbets,I still think this is a good play. Just hit 13 Green SPY days in a row as of today
2021-04-13 17:51:53,wallstreetbets,"420C by Eow or 4/20

Then I'll be bear."
2021-04-13 18:52:22,wallstreetbets,Let me know when this moves the other way so I can get into $UVXY weeklies!! I like this play.
2021-04-13 19:03:20,wallstreetbets,I'm feeling really good about this play. My April puts not so much

Question, 410 is where has to hit and you can sell it when it will be under? Sorry I'm noob in options :("
2021-04-13 17:32:28,wallstreetbets,I don’t see how these don’t at least break even lol I got till June for a dump
2021-04-13 17:23:43,wallstreetbets,This guy has insider info
2021-04-13 17:17:03,wallstreetbets,June should be fine. 💎 hands 🙌
2021-04-13 18:42:50,wallstreetbets,2 weeks of straight green has historically fallen sharply. I think she's fine
2021-04-13 17:10:32,wallstreetbets,🙏🏻
2021-04-13 17:28:47,wallstreetbets,"No, this IS my portfolio. I’m a retarded bear"
2021-04-13 19:16:28,wallstreetbets,Thank you for this. Lost my shit on that. It’s funny because it’s true.
2021-04-13 17:17:15,wallstreetbets,thanks bro me too I’m risking it
2021-04-13 17:37:28,wallstreetbets,RIP just bury me next to my fellow dead bears that’s all I ask
2021-04-13 18:53:51,wallstreetbets,That's what we said.
2021-04-13 19:32:51,wallstreetbets,As someone who’s gotten their ass blown out by puts on SPY. I would at least hedge with short term calls....
2021-04-13 19:57:48,wallstreetbets,I don't see how we don't retest 220 lol i got till April for the rug pull
2021-04-13 17:25:31,wallstreetbets,Yea my wife’s boyfriend plays a weekly card game with jpow. He said rates staying low and printer goes brrrrr.
2021-04-13 18:18:09,wallstreetbets,"I think so too. I have a bit of short fetsh myself, though I'm gonna wait till end of April."
2021-04-13 18:15:36,wallstreetbets,Any particular reason you see spy dying or just a gut feel?
2021-04-13 18:37:01,wallstreetbets,Look at it over the last two weeks... scary

2021-04-13 17:49:43,wallstreetbets,"I’m in, hopefully you are following some good DD"

2021-04-13 18:00:35,wallstreetbets,I'm following the one true king of DD!
2021-04-13 17:29:50,wallstreetbets,You’re going to be the entire volume of a 1 minute candle tomorrow. Welcome to the club!
2021-04-13 17:43:37,wallstreetbets,"Read /u/NrdRage's DD on this one. This is actually my 2nd trip with them, first one resulted in 500% gains.  Easy cash!"
2021-04-13 17:39:02,wallstreetbets,"You mean a price not since seen since......last week?  Yeah, it's totally not going to be able to do that in the next 2+ months. Also, that's the breakeven for the expiration date.  It moves up another 50 cents and I'm green."
2021-04-13 18:33:07,wallstreetbets,lol an ETF
2021-04-13 17:49:12,wallstreetbets,Got it sell
2021-04-13 17:43:12,wallstreetbets,"I didn't comment on the ability to eventually reach that.

The underlying is $11.6x and you have breakeven of 14.63. 

Ouch! 

Standing by it EVEN IF THE OPTION PRINTS!"
2021-04-13 17:51:42,wallstreetbets,"Um, you do realize that when you buy a call, you don't have to hold it to expiry, right?  And you are aware that most people don't, correct?  This one jumped to 11.75 in AH.  If it holds that and adds another...maybe 25 cents to 12 tomorrow, her options have already printed.    


I'm not sure you understand how this works."
2021-04-13 18:18:04,wallstreetbets,I have an odd feeling that you are either holding AMC or GME right now. Perhaps both?
2021-04-13 18:17:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I completely understand how buying OTM options works.   


Its just worth less today than when it was bought, which is an ""ouch"" situation.   


Losing value does hurt doesn't it?  


I have options i+n the red, I know they will print (or think they will) but every dollar ""down"" sucks.   


6/18 13c was $1.10 EOD today (Breakeven 14.10)   


11c was 2.10 Breakeven 13.10.   


TBH, I am not sure you understand how this works or the meaning of ""ouch"" either.   


Which one are you having issues with?   


\-"
2021-04-13 18:26:56,wallstreetbets,"Why TF would you think that?   


I was in and cashed out on both GME dumps and an (much smaller) AMC dump as well.  


Just because someone thinks that a posted play is not a good one or realizes that the EXACT SAME bet can be purchased cheaper RIGHT NOW, THIS VERY SECOND doesn't mean they are an idiot and holding bags of failed businesses.   


Sometimes, people disagree with your bets a and that's part of WSB. Being rude to people you disagree with is not exactly the hallmark of a decent human being.   


Assuming they are an idiot just because they disagree with you is not the mark of an intelligent human being capable of rational thought and appropriate conversation.   


Ouch means ouch and losing money hurts. Buying an option and watching the price go down also hurts (lost value).  


You might wanna step back and realize not everyone with a different opinion is a moron holding bags of GME and other dying retailers.   


Maybe learn to deal with people that you disagree with in a healthy manner? You will have a happier life not being a total shitbag."
2021-04-13 18:41:53,wallstreetbets,"So now your claim is that you always time a market exactly and never spend any time red on a play?

And here I thought I was good.  And ""losing value"" can't hurt unless you realize those losses"
2021-04-13 18:31:38,wallstreetbets,woah chill wtf

Call for long
Put for short. Can I sell put, then it will be long or there is no option like that?
And also if I speculate that co. will go down from now It's 60, better set put for 60? 58 or 52?
Thx and no offense, Im retard and new, help necessary!"

2021-04-13 19:43:45,wallstreetbets,And one more it is -10% lets say. Expire date It's next week. Can I sell it? Or I should wait for expire?
2021-04-13 19:09:32,wallstreetbets,"Not GME/AMC though

2021-04-13 17:31:36,wallstreetbets,Pfizer will bounce between 32-42 like it always does
2021-04-13 17:07:05,wallstreetbets,Warren buffett sold his entire stake in pfizer...
2021-04-13 18:09:02,wallstreetbets,"I literally sold my Pfizer stock last week. The next day the stock went up, and now there is talk around it. Sigh."
2021-04-13 17:17:57,wallstreetbets,PFE is a boomer stock. It doesn’t move much. Since your call is deep in the money so should be fine but not much upside.
2021-04-13 17:22:13,wallstreetbets,Why not Moderna and Catalent (manufacturer) ?
2021-04-13 17:27:00,wallstreetbets,Nvm my previous...brilliant as long as you hlod. Good luck!

2021-04-13 19:07:13,wallstreetbets,"Was thinking the same thing when I heard the J&J news, but a quick google dropped pfe back from on deck to my watch list. The google machine told me that an Israeli lab found that the S African variant was able to break through the pfizer vaccine.

May be fine as a boomer pick up, dividend, longstanding, savings account and whatnot, but I'm gonna dig a bunch deeper before making any kind of real play here."
2021-04-13 18:03:46,wallstreetbets,"I held it for 3 years. Ended up exactly the same place it was when I bought it. 

Sold it for GME"
2021-04-13 18:10:07,wallstreetbets,"This is why I sold it last week. If it continues to rise, I will be a little mad. Haha."
2021-04-13 17:09:38,wallstreetbets,"Same like pfizer ceo, if I'm not wrong it was ceo...
60% of his portfolio.
Pfizer had chance to lift off at 10.11 with the first info... There is some shit inside cuz they didnt lift like moderna, novavax etc...
Ps.
Even Polish companies started with rumors and awesome lift off for ex. Biomed Lublin, Mabion, Mercator - they made X00% with rumors xD"
2021-04-13 17:19:33,wallstreetbets,Pfizer today is not pfizer of last decade. Whole new product line. 20b - 40b in new sales. Subscription model. Top brand. Loaded. To. The. Tits.
2021-04-13 17:23:49,wallstreetbets,Moderna to 300 EOY on similar sales
2021-04-13 19:24:26,wallstreetbets,"I just keep a few hundred shares. Trim it by half when it gets near 40, then rebuy when it goes back towards 35. Wash rinse repeat"
2021-04-13 17:12:50,wallstreetbets,"I think with pfizer lift off is something behind and big fish they know that something stincks... 
Maybe in next month there will be case like AstraZ"
2021-04-13 19:49:13,wallstreetbets,"I don’t have the patience for that. 

Literally every other stock I bought at the same time (AAPL, BYND, ADM, AMZN, DIS, CNI) went up by at least 100% whereas Pfizer stayed still"
2021-04-13 17:15:28,wallstreetbets,"FckMe I'm Ape and I'm writing to myselfe xd
There is something strange cuz even Germany they don't have enough doses for themself... You know what I mean... Sell shit abroad, test there and after all we can take it in our own country"

2021-04-13 18:32:57,wallstreetbets,Post this everyday and maybe one day you'll be right
2021-04-13 19:47:58,wallstreetbets,"RSI is an indicator alright. However, not to be used how you explain it imo.  Maintaining a reading of over 69 is sexy hot and shows strength in the rally.  Maintaining a reading under 31 is a sign of extreme weakness and any rally should be sold as the expectation is for the downward trend to continue.  If you take a historical look at RSI on a monthly chart or Weekly chart you can see once the RSI gains sexy 69 and keeps it for 2 periods of the chart timeline that is uber bullish.  ASO is a great example. Put ASO WEEKLY chart up on your screen and take a look at the RSI and how the stock has performed for months. I bought GME today based on a shorter time frame. However, the longer time frame charts are all kinda broken."
2021-04-13 17:23:50,wallstreetbets,Techs don’t matter on manipulated stocks

2021-04-13 19:46:32,wallstreetbets,"First I'm gonna call this what it is total nonsense.

Second to highlight your nonsense I'm going to ask a question related to your TLDR. This reversal will be because retailers come in and buy more (because retailers have all ready been buying a fuckton for a long time) or will come from hedge funds having to cover (because some how you think a technical indicator signals when hedge funds are going to be forced to cover)?"
2021-04-13 17:46:27,wallstreetbets,You wish

2021-04-13 17:59:03,wallstreetbets,Good for you for making it so far. I saw GME in the title and upvoted.
2021-04-13 18:23:29,wallstreetbets,If a poster can use proper capitalization they will get my upvote.
2021-04-13 17:52:55,wallstreetbets,If we keep posting reversal is coming on every red day eventually one of us will be right for an hour.

2021-04-13 19:32:53,wallstreetbets,No... no it hasn't. The only that has been correct has been done in hindsight.
2021-04-13 18:17:22,wallstreetbets,"None exactly. I'm amazed how every single one has been wrong.

The only ones which have been correct including DD and discussion since January have been the ones based on options data which took OI chain and calculated number of shares required to be bought to cover the excess calls sold by institutions open in the market."

2021-04-13 17:49:50,wallstreetbets,I think everyone’s first gain/loss/yolo *needs* to be options. Shares are boring. I wanna see some ten or twenty baggers people.
2021-04-13 17:08:29,wallstreetbets,Thank u god. Hope this clears up the cancer of trash posts we’ve seen the last few months. Nobody cares about these broke boys with their 5 shares of GME or AMC.

2021-04-13 18:05:14,wallstreetbets,There should be a percentage of account requirement or something. Someone with a $1m account throwing $25K in shares of something isn't a YOLO; someone with a 5K margin account throwing 9K in OTM options expiring the next day is a YOLO
2021-04-13 17:01:52,wallstreetbets,I wish *share* YOLOs weren't even allowed. I don't understand the point of them. It's not risky and millions of people do it every day. No one gives a shit you bought $25k of AAPL. We don't need posts of people just buying shares. They're most likely the same shares everyone else has lol. Remove them and only allow share loss/gain posts. Those are the only things people care about. Only allowing share loss/gain posts knocks 2 birds out with 1 stone. It shows the YOLO and the loss/gain.

2021-04-13 17:54:56,wallstreetbets,"I think the mods should consider decreasing minimum for YOLO if it’s expiring on same week.

2021-04-13 17:45:24,wallstreetbets,"One minor gripe I have is the billion dollar market cap rule. There's companies that sit around that cap or under it and break the rule but are legit YOLO plays. I mean hell if risk is the spice of this kitchen a sub billion market cap is higher risk than a mega cap or w/e.

Not advocating pennystocks or anything like that and don't think DD should necessarily be allowed on cap<1B but the spirit of a YOLO is maximum retard at its most spectacular."

2021-04-13 18:03:14,wallstreetbets,"Uhh. I don’t time for all my porn losses. 

I’m down overall $20k on GME (avg $225’ish).  

Blessed be future fruits though 🙏🏼💎🦍"
2021-04-13 18:50:58,wallstreetbets,">Your gain or loss **must** be realized, or about to expire (<1 day) before you can post. If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close.

I like this idea! but I feel like no one follows this rule, and will continue to not, lol. Especially because once you close your position, it’s usually less obvious from a given screenshot what the return was from that specific security."
2021-04-13 17:38:14,wallstreetbets,Tell that to my ex wife
2021-04-13 17:55:05,wallstreetbets,That is actually what Buffet and Munger say basically

2021-04-13 17:33:43,wallstreetbets,So we shouldn't diversify our losses?

2021-04-13 18:37:52,wallstreetbets,"Yup, been seeing a lot of ""loss porn"" on LEAPS. Unless if they're planning on selling them at -75% 8 months out from expiration then I guess they belong here."
2021-04-13 18:15:34,wallstreetbets,I want to see more options at 0.01
2021-04-13 19:01:56,wallstreetbets,Nah shares can be good but I think the thresholds should be significantly higher. Like $100k+ gain/loss for shares and maybe $500k/$1mm for a share YOLO
2021-04-13 17:20:22,wallstreetbets,I'm tired of seeing the gme options posts from February and January. I know gme kinda sucks right now for gain porn but that's just karma farming

2021-04-13 18:16:04,wallstreetbets,The solution to that would be to just not have share YOLO posts. Only allow the gain/loss post. Literally the solution to all the issues with share posts is to only allow gain/loss posts.
2021-04-13 17:12:54,wallstreetbets,"I don't really like share YOLOs either, especially for larger stocks, however, there have been some interesting share YOLOs on stocks that don't usually get discussed, like PRPL or PINS. Another example of where they would make sense is in biotech companies with binary events.

One solution could be to raise the limit to $50K or $100K (and as the sub grows, this becomes more feasible) -- but we've already just raised it from $10K to $25K, so it may be better to take it slow for now.

That said, if the position is big enough, then no matter which way the stock moves, a sufficiently large share YOLO would qualify for the gain/loss flair."
2021-04-13 17:03:48,wallstreetbets,"I don't mind them personally, I'm skilled enough to lose *a lot* of money with just shares in a very short period of time. It is kind of boring when they buy something with no volatility though."
2021-04-13 17:46:20,wallstreetbets,Shares of 3X leveraged ETFs should be allowed. I wanna see those.
2021-04-13 19:02:59,wallstreetbets,"We were also all bitching in August when everything was a TSLA YOLO and those were options. 

As much as I hate seeing the same shit now we do go through that, and if the rules are *too* limiting we might have a feed that gets really boring.


^(I’ll never bitch about TSLA again)"
2021-04-13 17:10:30,wallstreetbets,"> No one gives a shit you bought $25k of AAPL. 

And posts like that would be rightfully downvoted. Still though it's fun to see people yeet tens of thousands at a stock I never heard of, or a company that's super volatile during earnings, or at risk of going bankrupt."
2021-04-13 17:03:50,wallstreetbets,Share YOLO’s shouldn’t be allowed at all.
2021-04-13 17:14:47,wallstreetbets,I mean personally haven't yolo'd. For shares I'd ban shares on blue chip companies. For contracts idc
2021-04-13 19:49:27,wallstreetbets,share yolos on penny or meme stonks can be very interesting! but those were someone bought a million in nio back in november 2020 for example
2021-04-13 18:35:39,wallstreetbets,Probably would be really hard to keep track and then looking back over time. At this point someone at least could make it an impressive gain
2021-04-13 18:08:24,wallstreetbets,It's a slippery slope to P&D posts

2021-04-13 17:51:35,wallstreetbets,I do. As soon as I start to lose I jump to something else and lose there too

2021-04-13 18:10:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm biased because based on their last update I'm holding more shares than them, but I only care to see yolo updates in the format of adding a buy-in that meets the current rule requirements, unrealized gains that are double or more, or unrealized losses that are half or more."
2021-04-13 18:06:54,wallstreetbets,Share yolos should be your entire account or net worth or at least a very significant and impactful portion
2021-04-13 19:58:24,wallstreetbets,"Share and option YOLOs should be text posts with the YOLO screenshot. The text should contain the reasoning behind. This would be more powerful than some questionable DDs. 

Also, aren't we here exchanging ideas for future gain? Gain/loss porn look at the past. YOLOs look at the future."
2021-04-13 17:20:18,wallstreetbets,"With share YOLOs the gain/loss is going to be minimal. Most shares fluctuate like 1-5% each day. So even at $100k the loss is going to be minimal and boring and not even worthy of a loss/gain post. So what's the point of allowing the YOLO post if the loss/gain is going to be minimal? If it was me, I'd set the minimum at 250k since a daily drop/gain could actually be a lot."
2021-04-13 17:15:20,wallstreetbets,ban blue chip shares ?
2021-04-13 19:11:49,wallstreetbets,SOXL anyone???
2021-04-13 18:14:55,wallstreetbets,">  I wanna see those.

Yeah, the gain/loss posts. Just posting that you bought it isn't that intersting."
2021-04-13 17:12:39,wallstreetbets,"> And posts like that would be rightfully downvoted.

And so should posts about AMC or whatever flavor of the week it is. No one really cares unless you gain or lose. What is the take-away from someone posting they bought 25k of AMC? What is there to discuss? Nothing. You're 1 of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people who are doing the same thing. It's not special."
2021-04-13 18:38:18,wallstreetbets,But if there's a massive threshold like 10k on it I can't see the problem. Tis but a dream

The fact that its hugely volatile?

I'm tired of the meme stocks too and most of the people they brought with them. Nature will heal. Doesn't mean we need to ban share posts outright."

2021-04-13 17:39:09,wallstreetbets,"Share recall is done by holders of the stock NOT the company. Seriously, learn how this stuff works. A share recall would not be in Blackrock's interest (probably the main lender of shares) because it would get rid of a source of income for them. They don't care what the stock is valued at as their funds are all passive so squeeze or not makes no difference. You can see a paper from 2019 that discusses share lending by passive funds.

2021-04-13 19:55:23,wallstreetbets,"Because they weren't actually as close to bankruptcy as new media pushed, hence DFVs initial 20 dollar price target and Burrys initial buy in. The March bonds being paid out and these bonds being paid out means the company feels positive about overcoming short term debt.

As for dividend payout and acquisition regarding the current debt I can't speculate, but I'd imagine a company paying off long term debt before short term means they feel good about upcoming profits"

2021-04-13 18:32:30,wallstreetbets,Kudos to winning big today but it may have been helpful to buy May monthlies than hoping it rallies another 5-10% in the next three days. Wish you the best of luck but weeklies are dangerous.
2021-04-13 17:29:14,wallstreetbets,Grab your D\*\*\* and Double Click!

Real talk nice gains and fuck you."
2021-04-13 19:45:41,wallstreetbets,"Can someone please help me understand how this works? So you sell for example a ITM call, then immediately buy a OTM call, same expiration or different? Do you gain a profit only if the price passes your OTM call?"
2021-04-13 19:53:28,wallstreetbets,HE HAS 1 SHARE LMFAO

2021-04-13 19:37:57,wallstreetbets,"It's fine if it gives OP mental comfort, but the ""house money"" thing isn't smart from a practical standpoint. Just leads to taking more risk, as shown by the OP still being so heavily invested in a single speculative play."
2021-04-13 17:25:22,wallstreetbets,That's what they wanted you to do be afraid while they shorted and then bought up all the shares.
2021-04-13 18:26:41,wallstreetbets,I stopped using margin. It's cash all the way. Margin losses add up quick.
2021-04-13 17:04:48,wallstreetbets,Someone’s wife is looking for a new BF
2021-04-13 17:30:41,wallstreetbets,It's just in case I lose everything on options. I can sell that share and by a 25 cent option and do a $25 to 2.5K Challenge.
2021-04-13 17:26:54,wallstreetbets,I sold last demo day for a modest 40-50K in profit. I've learned things this time and I'm prepared.
2021-04-13 17:34:20,wallstreetbets,"With Events like this what I did is sold ITM options for profit and used it to buy further OTM options with half the money, and then double that, and double again etc. Keep selling ITM and buy OTM with 50%. Less and Less risk. More and More Gain."

2021-04-13 16:32:03,wallstreetbets,"My poor 1 PLTR share, but I'm holding on to some of my lowest break even calls to exercise at 22.82."
2021-04-13 17:41:47,wallstreetbets,Nah I held my 200X 25 Strikes. I sold most of my 26's at 60-70 cents but then I bought like 10 more on close for 59 cents. I was hoping for a bigger dip when I sold the 26's.
2021-04-13 18:35:44,wallstreetbets,I'm going to exercise 10 calls at 22.82 and I've got 24 more 23.32.
2021-04-13 18:25:15,wallstreetbets,My Harmonic Patterns Algo shows PT of 32.59 and $46 but It rarely hits it's second price target. I'll hold some shares till 46 once I exercise some of these calls and get my shares for $22-23.
2021-04-13 19:57:58,wallstreetbets,It’s probably so he can watch the price easy .
2021-04-13 17:43:30,wallstreetbets,Do you think it will go up when DFV exercises his options on the 16th. Thoughts? Good Price Entry?
2021-04-13 17:51:02,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know but I’ve gone fucking through it with PLTR. Fucking finally broke 23, then 24 then FUCKING 25!!!!! LETS FUCKIN GOOO"
2021-04-13 19:20:30,wallstreetbets,That's pretty normal for us.
2021-04-13 19:11:42,wallstreetbets,"I was a bit shocked to see you didn't wait until at least a boom tomorrow or the next day, but hey - if for some reason it doesn't go down now you've not lost anything but unrealized gains. Been following you since you posted it, congrats and f you :)"
2021-04-13 18:27:21,wallstreetbets,"I’m only at 1.25x as far as margin.

I do actually manage my risk very closely. 

For example I know Palantir is a 100% guarantee, therefore not a risk, lol."
2021-04-13 17:24:25,wallstreetbets,Must be that guy who asked if he should pick up my wife after I lost all 39K.
2021-04-13 16:54:18,wallstreetbets,Now that is some big dick energy
2021-04-13 18:57:34,wallstreetbets,That's great. I was worried for you if you were just gambling on weeklies
2021-04-13 18:28:41,wallstreetbets,"Your logic is definitely solid. I’m sure it won’t go to $46 soon. My TA suggests it’ll go to $30 and base line around those levels before a run higher is possible. But I wanna believe $46 is possible cause PLTR is moving to $25 today even with all the shorts and the demo day stuff. Earnings could be a a catalyst to go to $46. 

I got in small with $100 on some 4/30 $40C today. It won’t cover earnings but thinking there’ll be a run up."
2021-04-13 18:35:54,wallstreetbets,"It'll go up slightly tomorrow, a bit more Thursday, and explode Friday imo.

It'll definitely go up when DFV exercises, whoever sold him that contract has to come up with 500,000 shares instantly. Do they have all those shares? Probably not. They'll have to buy at least some at market price to sell to DFV at $16, probably a $200/share loss for them at the peak when he drops the bomb.

I averaged down to $142 and I'm quite pleased, my wifey bought at $140 today."
2021-04-13 18:21:20,wallstreetbets,Being a PLTR Bull is like being in an Abusive Relationship and you keep saying hit me harder daddy! And then after months of Punishment he buys you a BMW!
2021-04-13 18:37:47,wallstreetbets,I'm just excited to watch Demo Day!

2021-04-13 16:30:47,wallstreetbets,"Ayyyyy great news!
And you know what follows great news for gme? A fire sale!"
2021-04-13 16:55:45,wallstreetbets,"Cohen: ""This isn't working""

Board: ""We know, which part should we fix first?""

Cohen: ""All of it. Reset everything to 0. Get rid of everyone. Pay off all the debt. Redo all the stores. Redo the website. This is a new company. I do not ever want to hear 'but we used to..' in this room. No you didn't. You didn't used to anything because the company we're building didn't exist before today. You can keep the logo. Maybe.""

This is what companies need that aren't making it through the internet revolution, but they're too scared to do it. AMC could really use this type of attitude in their corner.

EDIT: wow, thanks everyone. your love of my comment has inspired me to start writing screenplays. I naturally think in ""scenes"" like this and usually I'm the guy giggling to myself when nothing funny has happened."

Other than fucking hedgie bois, any reason to pay down all short term debt (assuming interest rate would be lower on this?) leaving $145 million cash/equivalents and debt free? Thinking about it like my finances (am retard though) why pay down low interest debt when you can make more gainz than interest owed?"

So basically we are not a meme stonk anymore this company has fundamentals and a vision to the oncoming future we are playing catch up still but GME is running now not just trying to walk, and they best way to thank us is by recalling most of their borrowed shares and make the Hedgies to pay for trying to kill this company.

2021-04-13 19:32:37,wallstreetbets,"Brilliant because paying off this debt early allows GME a lot of flexibility going forward. Including ability to issue dividends, share repurchase, selling assets and mergers & acquisitions. Bullish af."

Fuck those paper🙌 bitches that sold-out 🔥🌞"
2021-04-13 17:06:47,wallstreetbets,"the bear thesis has been obliterated today. Now it's a question of where the stock will consolidate, and just how much it will grow in the coming years. This is ignoring the pink elephant in the room on a unicycle with an economic ICBM strapped to its back that is the looming infinity squeeze"
2021-04-13 18:53:21,wallstreetbets,"This is good and bad.  It's good because paying off debt frees up cash for other things and I'm sure there were negative covenants that now are no longer a limiting factor (though I dont know what they were, haven't looked)

It's bad though, because the business is still hemorrhaging cash.  They need cash to fund the turnaround or they're going to have to keep taking it from investors.

GME remains the most interesting stock in the world.  If only apes would shut the fuck up."
2021-04-13 17:09:51,wallstreetbets,"Unreal news (also the part of it mentioning of how this removes the restrictions the bonds placed on acquisitions, dividends etc) price jumped 1%... If this was 2 months ago the price would have jumped much more than fucking 1% on that news...

Manipulation at its finest, thanks SEC, once im outta GME fuck your market in done and I'm sure there will be a lot to follow"
2021-04-13 17:11:27,wallstreetbets,That shoots down all the negative share offering stories

2021-04-13 17:19:40,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain everything in ape terms and what that means for me a 10 share stock holder
2021-04-13 17:16:10,wallstreetbets,This increases the chance that these HFs get margined called. They're absolutely screwed.
2021-04-13 16:44:45,wallstreetbets,"Well, now we know who has been selling stock this week... Or at least, it's likely GME. They have some time to report a sale under their at the market plan, don't they?"
2021-04-13 17:43:56,wallstreetbets,"Someone please explain wtf is going on, cause my brain is smoother than my wife after a fresh wax before a weekend away with her boyfriend."
2021-04-13 17:15:30,wallstreetbets,Notes....being?
2021-04-13 18:40:56,wallstreetbets,"Could someone answer? I'm just curious what all this really means.

* Is it possible that this was blocking them from selling their stock as well? As soon as they're debt free they can sell shares and generate money to operate on the transformation?
* If a company spends money to pay debt is it then considered less valuable on the market (technically they lost money and therefore value)? Does it mean such news make the stock price fall?"
2021-04-13 16:48:12,wallstreetbets,Doesn't this just mean they're going to issue stock as they announced a few weeks ago to get finance?
2021-04-13 17:22:06,wallstreetbets,"Literally the first time I've ever seen people get so excited over a call of a massively ITM bond.

This has been expected for months. Was even in the 10k IIRC."
2021-04-13 16:25:01,wallstreetbets,So they got free money by selling shares to apes and then they pay the 10% loan? Apes like to give their money.
2021-04-13 17:08:38,wallstreetbets,stock is barely moving ah :(
2021-04-13 18:26:50,wallstreetbets,"Good news!?

2021-04-13 16:44:21,wallstreetbets,"well, you see people never cared for fundamentals when it was at its peak so now it has lowered I think that sentiment is still here. if it drops based on good news that just means people still think its over valued when talking about its business."

Gamestop has this capital because they sold off shares after the insane price increase. Any source that it's due to the company performing well?"
2021-04-13 18:08:06,wallstreetbets,"Now this is how we make money

So everyone buy GME

Cause the hedgies lack liquidity

Cause they all went short on GME"
2021-04-13 18:52:13,wallstreetbets,Probably only need to offer 1 of those 3.5 million shares when this rocket takes off 😂🦍
2021-04-13 19:15:49,wallstreetbets,"Yep this is huge, it frees them up to do a lot more things as listed in their 10-K filing, selling shares and quickly having even more cash on had being one of them. MOASS preparations!"
2021-04-13 16:14:31,wallstreetbets,If anyone was still hoping that GME was going bankrupt just lost that hope.
2021-04-13 18:31:13,wallstreetbets,yes as it kills the bear thesis that the company would go bankrupt to lenders and it allows them to issue dividends and aquire smaller companies
2021-04-13 19:44:09,wallstreetbets,wtf do you think?!
2021-04-13 17:50:27,wallstreetbets,"I swear to god this team running the show are so smart. So can they actually announce a dividend on 6/9? If so that would mean if no one recalls their shares, GME can still issue a dividend and there for screwing over the shorts anyway?"
2021-04-13 16:59:52,wallstreetbets,"OH MY FUCKING GOD!

This is absolutely amazing news. This company is not fucking around."
2021-04-13 17:56:17,wallstreetbets,Did you see the part about issuing equity? Which is what they've stated they want to do?

2021-04-13 18:12:23,wallstreetbets,"The short thesis was likely tied into this debt, the restrictions that came with it and being unable to pay it off."
2021-04-13 18:34:52,wallstreetbets,Analysts upgrade gme from 10 to $12!
2021-04-13 16:46:32,wallstreetbets,"Now the short thesis is.... value investors thought it was worth $25 or $30 bucks a year ago, and not a lot has changed on the business (really a wash between the unexpected console disc thing, offset by lackluster holiday sales vs expectations), and the stock is now $140... Actually far more sane than the prior short thesis, which was one of the most crowded trades on wall street with that 250% short interest."
2021-04-13 19:23:43,wallstreetbets,How the fuck does that even make sense when gamestop could have repurchased all of the gme with part of the beer money in their coffers for a good while there?
2021-04-13 19:57:30,wallstreetbets,And yet they double down again and again. They better post their loss porn here when this is done.
2021-04-13 18:09:10,wallstreetbets,My short thesis is that the company is excellent but not worth 200 dollars. Hence why I'm short.
2021-04-13 19:31:17,wallstreetbets,So we can finally stop this non-sense about a massive squeeze? We can go back to reality?

2021-04-13 17:52:11,wallstreetbets,AMC needs to demo some of their older theaters and convert them into drive thrus with blue tooth connections for people to bring their own headsets.  Just do PW verification on a randomly generated keychain for people to sync with and have people bring food to their cars old timey style.  I know not everyone has convertibles these days but plenty of people have trucks or SUVs or what not with decent space to sit in the back if you just back the car in.

2021-04-13 17:10:08,wallstreetbets,"Look at short term and long term debt. 

From memory I think they had 900 million in short term debt. This is mainly goods in stock that’s just waiting to be sold (it’s a debt you have to carry if you want to have products on the shelf). 

The long term debt (equivalent of a mortgage on your house) they had was 200 million. And now it’s gone. 

This is AMAZING news. A company in trouble does not pay off debt. This company is poised to go through the fucking roof.

EDIT: look at smart monkey below. Most of short term debt is in fact not stock but rental commitments."

2) raising money will not adversely affect stockholders even if they decide to. Amendments are being made to have board members salaries based on stock price (similar to musk and Tesla) which means that Cohen and Co. Will have the stockholders best interests in mind 100% going forward"

2021-04-13 16:55:08,wallstreetbets,GameStop still has other liabilities but this is then paying off all long term debt. The long term debt is in the form of senior notes that have a 10% interest rate.
2021-04-13 17:01:47,wallstreetbets,"not 10% OF senior notes, ALL senior notes issued at 10% rate. They still have $147million short term debt (and about twice that in cash after this long term debt payment)"

2021-04-13 16:53:44,wallstreetbets,They had 600m cash on hand without selling stock. They arent going to sell those until the squeeze happens.
2021-04-13 16:49:47,wallstreetbets,"216.4M at a price of $140 would only be 1.5M shares. Definitely a large chunk, but shares available to borrow are already back down really low. So if they covered with the 1.5M **IF** GameStop did sell stock to achieve this they just reshorted themselves.

Regardless, I doubt GameStop blow 1/5th of their potential to raise capital via stock sale to clear debt that is 2 years out when the stock is at a month long low.

EDIT: Apparently my entire point is moot because they used cash lol."

It was eye opening to say the least. Roughly I'd say one in every 3 GME shares at least was being routed to a dark pool.... compared to far far less for Microsoft.

2021-04-13 16:21:46,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think they are debt free, but this bag was a heavy one. It’s a very good sign that they paid it off so early."
2021-04-13 16:54:38,wallstreetbets,Still have 150 million debt. This was all the long term debt though I just looked at the gamestop balance sheet on their website.

2021-04-13 17:25:24,wallstreetbets,"When you buy 1000 consoles from your supplier you say: “thanks for the delivery, I’ll pay you in 60 days”

Supplier says: “ok, your a trusted partner. I can wait 60 days”. 

You now have a ‘short term debt’ that you put in your books. But you also have 60 days to sell the part you just got delivered before you have to pay!

Every single company in the world that has suppliers has got short term debt. 

I do not know enough of their delivery and payment terms with all their suppliers to judge if it would be beneficial to work on decreasing or enlarge the short term debt. 

Do you think a company like Amazon pays cash on delivery? 

Tl;dr: short term debt not bad, means goods on shelf."

2021-04-13 17:16:56,wallstreetbets,"current debt is half their leftover cash and equivalents, biggest issue is some guy tweeted ""debt free"" and everyone ran with it. I dont think it's a stretch to say this is good news. Certainly helps cash flow over the next 2 years."
2021-04-13 17:13:36,wallstreetbets,"Oh no… they must pay rent.  This is terrible!   Where else can they sell their stock inventory.  Whatwillwedo!

Walmart paid 1.7 billion in rent last year, and owe 18 billion in future rent.  900 million in rent obligations long into the future is nothing."

I think they chillin 😎"
2021-04-13 16:56:47,wallstreetbets,we don't know that. They have time to report IIRC.  Do you know how long they are allowed to not disclose sale of stock for?
2021-04-13 16:56:32,wallstreetbets,"They had that cash pile for a while. The choice to use it suggests there's more cash coming. Nothing else changed other than declaring to sell a ton of shares. And they have a lot of cash needs - retiring bad leases early, building out eCommerce stuff, etc."
2021-04-13 16:55:04,wallstreetbets,"Why wouldn't they? It's sound finance to clean up their balance sheet and get some of these higher interest things off. The cash sitting around wont help, and they can always raise more debt later with a clean balance sheet."

 This just makes this news even more bullish!"
2021-04-13 17:33:23,wallstreetbets,"yeah this same process was going down in January during the run up as well, this is nothing new..

I think you're reading a bit too much into these, since they're all still reported. 

There's largely a sell off in retail GME, that shows in the L2 data. 

Additionally there are block trades going down, probably to deal with options this Friday.

So far there's no evidence of what you're claiming. Why would prime brokers put themselves in a position to be jailed for an underwater hedge fund? It just doesn't make sense. 

Unfortunately for you guys there isn't a big retail demand for a stock that's at a 3900% ATH. 
Most sane folks know to stay far away from that shit. And so the trend the last well few weeks is people selling stock they bought with funds they cant afford to lose.

You're in a small echo chamber when compared to the market itself."
2021-04-13 18:46:03,wallstreetbets,"Timing matters. It's exceptionally volatile and it's the lowest its been in a while. Stands to reason it'll climb at least from volatility in the near term.

Regardless, it doesn't matter because they did this with cash on hand.

And where the fuck did you get 3900%? I'd love to see that math, looks like it was in the mid 60s before."

2021-04-13 17:03:47,wallstreetbets,Some places penalise for paying debt off early.  Just something you forgot to mention.
2021-04-13 18:04:35,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm pretty sure that's a normal part of business. You collect payments from your customers as quickly as possible, and delay disbursing money you owe as long as you can reasonably get away with."
2021-04-13 18:26:20,wallstreetbets,"lol love the downvotes on zero disagreement just a quarter tendy of nuance.

Just to further clarify though, wouldn't what you're referring to be considered accounts payable on the balance sheet (which they separate from current debt)? Not tryna be a douche just tryna maybe learn something or confirm previous knowledge."

2021-04-13 18:39:41,wallstreetbets,Tesla's valuation is MUCH more unrealistic than GameStop's judging from the usual indicators like PE ratio. It's just accepted now because it has been high for so long.

2021-04-13 16:56:07,wallstreetbets,"True, but the real magic is that THE SHORTS have to pay that dividend out of pocket for all of the shares they’ve borrowed and sold to other people"

2021-04-13 17:50:14,wallstreetbets,"Putting aside the debt and further lease obligations, They have 492m in AP which is a liability they have to pay in the near term and had a cash flow from operations of 126m last quarter. If they’re spending 40% of their cash in retiring senior notes it basically makes it a certainty they’re going to use their shelf offering to dump the maximum number  shares as possible onto the market so they can meet their current cash obligations unless there’s some sudden spike in physical video game disc sales this quarter."
2021-04-13 18:15:42,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention Walmart has much larger storefronts than GameStop does. You find a GameStop in a strip mall so if GameStop wants to buy out of their lease it’s no big deal as the strip mall can just rent the space to someone else. If Walmart decides to close the literal warehouse of a storefront that was built for them I’d imagine that would be a little more tricky to do. Who the hell would fill that space if Walmart left (nobody). And to your point, GameStops future lease obligations are quite microscopic compared to other retail giants."

2021-04-13 18:13:09,wallstreetbets,"This, the idea is to sell the product before your vendors come knocking on your door for the money you owe them.

2021-04-13 17:47:48,wallstreetbets,GameStop may do what overstock did and issue a digital dividend.  Overstock issued 1 stock for each 10 stocks you owned.

2021-04-13 17:19:42,wallstreetbets,"Buutt, GME hasn't paid a dividend since March, 2019.  There's no dividend owed by the shorts unless the underlying pays a dividend.  Since GME didn't pay one, the shorts don't have to either.  

I'm no financial expert, but I think they just used on-hand cash to pay off some long term debt.  Still good news for us apes.  Might put some upward pressure on the price."
2021-04-13 17:01:04,wallstreetbets,Not sure you understand how anything works 😂
2021-04-13 17:15:49,wallstreetbets,"But even if the shorts have shorted 140 million shares, at $1 is it gonna have any impact at all?"
2021-04-13 19:35:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah good point i suppose. Wouldn't it be more prudent though to sort of  ""drip out"" shares say half a million/month if needed (give/take depending on cash flow and share price) throughout the year rather than dumping 3.5 million shares at once? Dilution would be minimal (only 5% total even they did dump them all) and they'd still get the cash needed."
2021-04-13 18:23:47,wallstreetbets,"It's crazy what BS people latch onto and try and portray as doom and gloom.  

What do people want?  GME to sell on Ebay and pay Ebay fees and PayPal fees?

But yeah, Walmart is pretty fucked for that 18 Billion.  No one talks about it though.  God forbid, it might actually tank the price.  18 billion is a stack of 100 dollar bills, all piled upon each other, 18 times the height of what the World Trade Centre was.  That's how big 18 billion is."
2021-04-13 17:22:19,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.  Businesses pay bills like rent/electricity, as it aids in their sales/making income.  It is one of the things that makes a company money.  Like paying employees.  Should all GME employee wages for the length of their contracts be added together and called debt also?  Used to be called Cost of Sales on accounts up until recently."
2021-04-13 18:00:04,wallstreetbets,"With how weak the stock has been this week, this froth is frothy. They can’t expect to sell into 250 or 300 and not crash the price in minutes."
2021-04-13 18:01:15,wallstreetbets,"Lowest in a month, but massive compared to the past year on average. It’s possible this stock price movement is them selling to raise money and they’ve not yet disclosed. Key question is how long do they have to disclose."
2021-04-13 18:31:22,wallstreetbets,"Because the board is in this for long term shareholder value and has a fiduciary responsibility around that. Screwing over the shorts is not their goal, and if they do so at the expense of normal shareholders, they can be sued, quite successfully, both by the shorts AND the shareholders, potentially on a personal basis."
2021-04-13 18:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Nah, calling someone a ""boomer"" is like calling someone a ""retard"" we aren't legit saying everyone is literally retarded, it's a state of mind or used to describe an action.

When the dividend comes, whoever borrowed your stock is on the hook to do one of two things.   1)  Buy back the stock and return it to you so you can collect your dividend, or 2) pay you the dividend out of their pocket. 

This ultimately results in two things.   Shorts cover their position and buy back their stock they borrowed, or the short position holder spends more money to keep their short position and just cover the dividend cost out of pocket to whoever their borrowed the stock from.

If someone is short say 100000 shares, and maybe their position is down 20% but they expect it to recover, it may be more cost effective to just pay out the dividend and wait for the stock to go down.  Or of course someone in the same position who doesn't have the $100,000 capital available may be forced to buy shares to cover their position.

Long story short, anyone short either needs to spend capital to continue their short position or buy back stock to cover their position.   Stock either goes up from buy backs, or short holders lose money.   Win Win."
2021-04-13 18:10:42,wallstreetbets,"To me, this is probably one of the best outcomes for apes. Hedgies can't just offer cash, they will have to buy their shorted portion of the ~70m Gamestop coins out there. Coin prices rise to astronomical numbers as each hedge fund tries to get their hands on them first, before the next HF."
2021-04-13 17:51:29,wallstreetbets,Oh my god 🤤
2021-04-13 18:15:18,wallstreetbets,Hnnnnnngggggg
2021-04-13 17:42:48,wallstreetbets,"Missing the point. Paying this debt off removes restrictions, one of them was they were not allowed to issue dividends. Once it’s paid off then they will be able to again. If they so choose to. I think a special dividend of $5 would send a nice message to the shorts  😏"
2021-04-13 17:03:00,wallstreetbets,"Hah, I assure you I understand this."
2021-04-13 17:20:42,wallstreetbets,"140,000,000 impacts"
2021-04-13 18:12:43,wallstreetbets,"Right, but what if the dividend is $20? $1 was just an arbitrary number thrown out there as an example."
2021-04-13 19:50:55,wallstreetbets,"People can think of any reason under the sun to shit on GME and I don’t understand why there’s so much hate. They are making moves and people are still out there saying that this company will be bankrupt before the year ends. Then you’ve got the TSLA gang who are glamorized for holding a company that barely (and I mean barely to the point of not being able to focus on production of new, perhaps more affordable/accessible vehicles) meeting production obligations. The first company to come out with an EV under $25000 sticker price is going to absolutely steal potential TSLA buyers at that point. No shade at TSLA but I could go on about their shortcomings and somehow that is a better investment than GameStop

Edit: I almost forgot, that 18 billion is a literally fuck ton of money but with Walmart’s market cap being what it is, I don’t think it is a huge problem for them."
2021-04-13 17:39:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they should. Do you not know what liabilities on a balance sheet are? All liabilities and business expenses are in the name of making more money. Doesn't mean you can just magically wish them away or that they don't exist.

It's a little sad people are willing to subvert accounting 101 and spread ignorance just because you like the stock lol."
2021-04-13 18:48:41,wallstreetbets,"That's fair, with how volatile the stock is it doesn't seem wise at all to me and it implies they believe they are significantly overvalued at a market cap of 9.87B which seems low for their goals."
2021-04-13 19:43:01,wallstreetbets,Isn’t it bad for business if your company is heavily shorted though?
2021-04-13 17:17:17,wallstreetbets,"He's ALIVE!!!   ALIVE I TELL YOU!!!

2021-04-13 16:55:49,wallstreetbets,Awesome.  Wise.
2021-04-13 19:43:35,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-13 18:52:04,wallstreetbets,If that's what I think it is I think I had it in the 70s
2021-04-13 17:08:54,wallstreetbets,G
2021-04-13 17:04:59,wallstreetbets,"I see. So essentially after shorts bought 10 shares and gave an IOU to 30 people that they have 1 share each, shorts need to pass 1$ of the dividend to 30 people, for a total of 30$ dividend, or get taken to court for financial bullshit? Does that sound approximately right?

Now how does receiving a dividend work? If I hold 100 shares in eToro, and a dividend of 1$ per share is paid out, does 100$ just appear in my eToro ""this is your available equity"" field?"
2021-04-13 17:05:24,wallstreetbets,That's delicious.
2021-04-13 18:56:33,wallstreetbets,Can you still get the dividend payment if your shares are still locked from swapping between brokers ?
2021-04-13 17:36:17,wallstreetbets,What happened
2021-04-13 19:27:16,wallstreetbets,"Ah, thank you kind sir for explaining to a smoothbrain."

2021-04-13 17:28:06,wallstreetbets,"$140m is nothing for a big hedgefuck like Citadel, right?"
2021-04-13 18:19:32,wallstreetbets,I thought the company should have had a very profitable year in order to pay such a huge per share dividend?
2021-04-13 17:40:15,wallstreetbets,Can I pay the tribute in installments? Like once a month?
2021-04-13 17:50:48,wallstreetbets,I'm finally popular! Hooray!
2021-04-13 17:35:50,wallstreetbets,!
2021-04-13 17:23:20,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-13 17:13:28,wallstreetbets,"Yep. And if you sold 50,000,000 shares short, guess what. You’ve got to pay that $50,000,000 of dividends to the people who bought those shares. Not GME. They only pay the dividend to the 70.3M shares they’ve issued. And if you remember from the Bloomberg terminal drops, institutions alone own nearly 100M shares. There are a shit ton of duplicate shares out there"
2021-04-13 17:16:01,wallstreetbets,"That's how it works for me with vanguard. Some brokers will ask if you want to do a recurring investment with your dividends though, meaning theyll put that $100 dividend payout towards more shares"
2021-04-13 17:19:02,wallstreetbets,"Essentially, yes. The person holding the actual share gets the dividend: the shorter has no rights because no ownership. So by the time it’s bought to cover, the dividends are delivered to the actual owner."
2021-04-13 19:25:25,wallstreetbets,Shouldn’t be a problem
2021-04-13 17:49:02,wallstreetbets,It's called RKT for a reason

2021-04-13 17:39:30,wallstreetbets,"Ya, basically no impact. When you figure their loss might be $20-100$ per share a $1 loss isn't much. 

Though this could have a big impact on options hedges. If there are heavily margined or shorted shares as a hedge, it could have a big effect for those people."

2021-04-13 17:23:57,wallstreetbets,"Is... is that perhaps what the ""we can issue extra stock"" thing was for a week ago?

Ryan issues X amount  dividend. 

Shorts end up having to pay 3X dividend. 

Most apes use the dividend to buy more GME.

Driving the price up. 

More stock gets sold. 

More dividend gets paid out."
2021-04-13 17:26:15,wallstreetbets,"This is quite interesting with date April 30, can they announce a dividend payout before April 30 and then the shorts will essentially help for pay for that senior notes and also help pay dividends to shareholders including us APEs?"
2021-04-13 17:25:26,wallstreetbets,"I am guessing if you had a short position of 50M shares, which would be valued at 7B, you can probably afford the 50M in dividends you suggest. Really an irrelevant thing."
2021-04-13 17:33:21,wallstreetbets,"Smoothest of brains here BUT if you opt to automatically reinvest into the stock, does that force the shorts to create a synthetic share because all company issued are taken? And then pay the dividend on that stock making an exponential increase in synthetic shares to later be covered while bleeding them financially???"

Weirdly there is 1 OI on may 21 30c

And 20 OI on 35c

Op owns half the 35c and maybe the 30c didn't update yet even though barchart claims to have live data???

Oh well that's bullish af...

2021-04-13 18:13:02,wallstreetbets,"Still formulating my game plan but one thing I am sure of, I will NOT be buying the COIN direct listing .   It will begin trading at absoluely *stupid*  levels not justified in any way, shape or form .   Boil it down , COIN is an exchange , similar to NYSE and NASDAQ, and when their competitors go public starting later in the year their trading fees and lucrative spreads will collapse ( akin to what happened to the retail brokers in the equities market )   
I could be wrong, but I don’t think so.   COIN is just riding on the coattails of the product it is selling , pure and simple.    Have a great day all."

2021-04-13 16:21:49,wallstreetbets,Why do you think this
2021-04-13 17:38:03,wallstreetbets,Seems like it’s about $4. If you want to turn $4 into $4 it’s the perfect stock for you.
2021-04-13 17:30:25,wallstreetbets,Uninteresting

2021-04-13 17:08:16,wallstreetbets,"No, it went up 9% today, some slight pullback is expected. Currently -0.8% AH. See the same thing with other stocks that went up a lot. Expecting a gain tomorrow at least until the demo."

Pfizer causes kidney stones

Astra causes brain clots

Moderna causes fevers worse than the fever it's trying to prevent

&#x200B;

They're all fucked."
2021-04-13 18:16:18,wallstreetbets,"No. The opposite.

Buying individual tickers implies that you, a single person who, like a central planner without access to diffuse information about people's preferences and trade-offs, know better than the market where resources should be allocated.

When you buy SPY you accept that markets are basically efficient and stocks go up."
2021-04-13 19:58:53,wallstreetbets,"Thanks dude, I was looking for a travel stock"

2021-04-13 16:15:09,wallstreetbets,imagine thinking a 1 in a million chance of getting a rare blood clot is a significant enough issue to buy puts on JNJ
2021-04-13 16:18:42,wallstreetbets,There's a better chance of you making money trading options than getting a blood clot from the vaccine.

2021-04-13 16:40:25,wallstreetbets,"take profits as theta burn becomes increasingly destructive. roll them out if you want to keep letting it ride, or only sell a portion. but you're dumb if you continue to hold into expiry unless you plan to exercise which I doubt."

2021-04-13 18:41:25,wallstreetbets,I think about it often: When would I cash out? It’s really difficult to answer sometimes. I am a poor but there is no dollar amount that seems like “enough”.
2021-04-13 18:35:23,wallstreetbets,The first day I made more money on my phone screen then all week at my relatively well paying job the illusion was over haha.
2021-04-13 16:20:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah a started with GME and now fucking with options, but i know i was just lucky and should probably stop, it's just gambling."

2021-04-13 16:06:07,wallstreetbets,"I did read it, and it's nothing but hopes, dreams and a lack of evidence."
2021-04-13 16:13:27,wallstreetbets,"Hopes and dreams? They've already got earnings to their name, and very good earnings I may add, in a field that will grow exponentially over the next few years. Hydrogen is expected to have a production market of $420 billion by 2030, and none of that value has been cooked into the price. With their current market share, that would put them 4x above their current price, 8x with a valuation close to that of Linde Plc. This is assuming they don't expand their operations, which they are, with an agreement to acquire 5 operating hydrogen plants in the US. If you'd like me to cite my sources for any of the numbers I've given, I can very easily do that."
2021-04-13 16:16:15,wallstreetbets,"Who expects the market to be that big? That demand doesn't actually exist. If you dig into where they are currently making money, and what industries they sell to (hydrogen specifically) there is no growth path there."
2021-04-13 16:21:50,wallstreetbets,"You clearly didnt read the DD, because I actually addressed the uses of hydrogen specifically. Add to that the fact that, in the past 12 months, 116,000 shares bought to only 22,000 shares sold by insiders, a 5x difference, suggests that they hold the same belief I do."
2021-04-13 17:12:40,wallstreetbets,"Okay let me address them all individually:

"" I think hydrogen has a better future than EV. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future, the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. ""

[https://afdc.energy.gov/files/u/publication/fuel\_comparison\_chart.pdf](https://afdc.energy.gov/files/u/publication/fuel_comparison_chart.pdf)

[https://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy08/43061.pdf](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy08/43061.pdf)

[https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-hydrogen](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-hydrogen)

Power generation:

Somewhat a moot point. Creating the hydrogen through electrolysis requires practically as much energy as you get out of it later. The only use case here is offline backup generators and remote locations, not standard grid work.  
Steam reforming still requires the use of fossil fuels, so why not just burn the darn NG in the first place instead of adding steps?

Shipping:

Cost is still over triple the cost of  low grade marine fuels used by the shipping industry. Marine fuels prices are subject to taxes that add cost. All the current costs quoted by hydrogen companies are supported by tax SUBSIDIES. So the end economic comparison is that hydrogen is actually significantly more expensive if placed on an even comparison; even with a 40% reduction by 2025.  
Secondly, volumetric efficiency. In order to store liquid or highly compressed gas hydrogen is still not even half as volumetrically efficient for BTU/unit vol. Okay lets even assume that it's used in a giant electrochemical reactor instead of being burned in an ICE or steam engine and you still get like double to triple the volume needed for fuel, and the storage is complicated and dangerous.

Aircraft:

Volumetric efficiency is the biggest challenge I see. Cant store it in the wings, so you lose cargo/cabin space. High pressure tanks have to be protected from vibration and G force that exceed all other use cases. This is expensive, heavy, and risk prone. The commercial air industry is extremely regulated and it takes decades for meaningful changes. The Max debacle is only going to further entrench that paranoia."
2021-04-13 18:22:57,wallstreetbets,"Transport was one of the uses of hydrogen. You didn't address the other uses. Elecrolysis costs are high yes, and it made me do a bit more research into the subject, because I thought any sort of clean energy tax would hurt their profit margin, but what I found solidifies my bullish stance. The byproducts of Coal gasification are a mixture of Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen, alongside some other species. I can't comment as to what they do with the other species, but they use Vacuum Swing Absorption technology to capture CO2 in high purity. They seperate Carbon monoxide from the synthetic gas stream containing Hydrogen and Carbon monoxide, and sell the monoxide too. This gets them much more value for their production prices."

If an operator starts there truck engine when its 31 degrees outside, goes back inside an leaves it run for 2 hours while they get your days tasks and help someone else load material. They don't think about the 2 gallons of fuel they wasted, their truck is warm. end of story. Multiply that by a fleet, that equals big wastes of money and wear on equipment.

The entire infrastructure plan is about winning middle americas votes and RIDE is a prime candidate to show as an example of democrats bringing jobs back AND supporting EV. How many other EV companies are in a position to be able to capitalize on both of those factors in a middle America depressed area that has been robbed of union jobs? Im in already and I I just bought more on this dip. Lordstown will moon over the next year as Democrats and Republicans print money and pour it into the EV and infrastructure deals.

2021-04-13 18:54:55,wallstreetbets,"Nice low average.  Just got mine down below $13 last week, the market’s been absolutely stupid so I’ll buy more if we’re still in this price range next month."

2021-04-13 19:13:55,wallstreetbets,A good purchase at this price. The people that say this is a scam are just idiot bears trying to spread FUD to profit off shorts. Yea... it’s a scam w the 3rd largest auto factory in the US and produced 5 Beta trucks now that they have posted on Twitter. Also all the employees and cars in the parking lot are also part of the scam... 🤣🙄🙄🙄
2021-04-13 18:48:22,wallstreetbets,Go Browns! Super hyped for the season this year. $RIDE production starts in September and the Brownies kick off their season in September! Can’t wait!!

If so, that’s a pretty astounding savings of $24,000 per year!"
2021-04-13 16:55:09,wallstreetbets,I don't own a fleet but really want to order one anyway.
2021-04-13 19:06:20,wallstreetbets,"> I put a real order in for one of these trucks.

No, you didn't. This company is not currently accepting ""real orders."" Because they don't have a ""real product"" for you to order."
2021-04-13 19:57:35,wallstreetbets,"\>  I put a real order in for one of these trucks. I Have a fleet of pickups and services Vans. 

Would love to see a purchase order with a price on it showing paid considering everything else that's been dug up by the media is a non-binding, non-purchase order, pseudo marketing agreement.

I've chatted with a few of my clients, many of which are anxious to see competitive pricing on EV fleet vehicles, but have been left underwhelmed by the lack of options to date. I'd love for nothing more than for the endurance to be the straw that finally gets it done, but Hindenburg's reports has me quite concerned for obvious reasons."
2021-04-13 18:46:34,wallstreetbets,GM gets their emission credits at a percentage to use for like 3 years but RIDE also gets access to GM parts catalog.

2021-04-13 16:23:05,wallstreetbets,"The current CEO was also CEO of Work Horse which is currently under investigation for fraud.

RIDE, the company he is currently CEO of, is also under investigation for fraud.

They don't even have a working product yet. The current product burst into flames when they attempted to drive it.

The CEO tried to pass off subscriptions to a mailing list as pre-orders.

Additionally they passed off a video of their product to show it as working. The reality was it was rolling down a hill as their current product does not work. As I stated before, it burst into flames.

I can see why you'd think the future is very bright here considering it's the motive of this forum to assume everyone is retarded."

2021-04-13 18:38:18,wallstreetbets,"All depends on what happens and why they don't finish.  Remember, this isn't a walk in the park type race.  There are dozens of entry's every year that do not finish the race.  BUT if endurance doesn't finish, it will be headlines and look for the stock to drop significantly.  Then the digging into the reason will start.  Was it driver error?  Was it something with the platform that will be in production?  Was it something in the modifications made (beefier suspension and all that).  Those who read up on what (if something does) goes wrong will have the advantage.  The rebound comes in the Fall when they start delivering trucks and the new owners of them start to give it thumbs up (or thumbs down).

Personally I'm hoping for a finish, and under 12 hours (winners typically finish in 5 hours, so give him an extra 5 for first time running, first time electric vehicle in this type of race, and 90 min for the recharge along the way.)

And like the OP said.  Balls of steel for entering a race like this . . . balls of steel.

(I have 38 shares of RIDE, and would like to increase it, but the ol' budget just isn't there to do it)"
2021-04-13 17:24:30,wallstreetbets,Wait for production and sales. Like OP States. Going electric in fleet is a no brainer. Demand will be huge from the get go if the vehicle is half decent.
2021-04-13 18:57:26,wallstreetbets,HodL....short term investment turns into potential 4X long!
2021-04-13 17:11:57,wallstreetbets,"I was wondering about that, too. Given the amount of questions and FUD for this company (from Hindenburg and others), I feel like they really need this to go well to quiet some of those doubts. Lots of promises but nothing delivered yet."
2021-04-13 19:30:53,wallstreetbets,"What's the plan if they don't do well in the race this weekend?

They have a 19-year-old washed up high-school baseball player driving for them. Kid didn't get a scholarship.

But ... but ... since they're the only entry in the EV class for this race, they only have to ""finish"" the ""race"" to ""win"" their class.

So they have that going for them, which is good."
2021-04-13 18:56:32,wallstreetbets,I also like the truck
2021-04-13 17:10:10,wallstreetbets,"What is unique about EV investing right now is this administration and many in congress wanting to pass an enormous EV spending bill, to be put to use at least for charging infrastructure and tax credits for EV purchases (perhaps even increasing them to $10k I read and also possibly undoing the volume of sales limits that decrease the tax credit."
2021-04-13 17:13:20,wallstreetbets,"Out of all the start ups, I think RIDE has the potential to last. The reason is that they have a unique approach to their power train. The IN wheel motor is unlike anything else (much simpler design, and perhaps much better performance) and if it works, it’s going to be a game changer in the automotive industry."
2021-04-13 16:57:21,wallstreetbets,"i agree, to date, much of it has been hype, but i believe we're at a fulcrum point where the whole world realizes that emissions of all kinds need to be brought more in line and EV tech has matured to a point where there's going to be less smoke and more fire."
2021-04-13 19:58:39,wallstreetbets,Hmmm. That’s a good question. Maybe you could call a brokerage firm that you use to ask? $PBW is a clean energy ETF that owns $RIDE - they added to their holdings recently. That’s a good ETF to own if you prefer ETFs over individual stocks.
2021-04-13 19:42:43,wallstreetbets,Agreed 100%
2021-04-13 18:40:04,wallstreetbets,"Unlike NKLA, RIDE has vehicles that DO move under their own power.  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)"
2021-04-13 19:11:33,wallstreetbets,"The biggest risk is hitting their September production target. There is a global chip shortage rn. Plus, they are still doing crash testing and allowing customers to test drive the beta models.

However, it’s worth noting that the CEO can’t sell any of his shares until late October. I found that out in the 10-K. So I think that is huge incentive for him to hit their September timeline."
2021-04-13 17:11:45,wallstreetbets,$RIDE is set up for a strong squeeze event based on the stuff I just read in this super DD.

2021-04-13 19:21:43,wallstreetbets,"So, you know how much a conventional motor adds to the vehicle, and how cars are literally engineered around it? Same thing will go with the hub-motors. Actually, the weight distribution will be better in Hub-Motors because all four wheels will have equal weights on them. Your center of gravity will be truly center to the vehicle. 

The hub motor isn’t that much heavier than an f-150’s brake assembly..   The weight of each elaphe hub motor is 75 lbs; for comparison, weight of an f-150’s rotor, caliper,  and mounting bracket is 62 lbs, and that’s w/o account pads and bearings.  I think the unsprung weight issue is totally overblown."

2021-04-13 18:41:18,wallstreetbets,"The Endurance pickup is poised to have a 75 Mile Per Gallon equivalent.  That's huge by itself.   The Fuel savings from 10 MPG to 75 is how I figure 7 fold savings.  There is another thing with fleet vehicles that affect fuel consumption; The operator.  If an operator starts there truck engine when its 31 degrees outside, goes back inside an leaves it run for 2 hours while they get your days tasks and help someone else load material.  They don't think about the 2 gallons of fuel they wasted, their truck is warm. end of story.   Multiply that by a fleet, that equals big wastes of money and wear on equipment.

They HAVE a working product and are showing POC (proof of concept) every day and the Baja race next week will be huge and televised. They obviously believe in their product, otherwise they wouldn’t be racing in one of the most intense truck races out there. 

You mention the CEO a lot in your comment. You forget to mention how great of an innovator he is. Here’s just a couple things he’s done in his days.

Mr. Burns has founded, grown, and sold several successful tech startups: iTookThisOnMyPhone: a mobile photo and video-sharing company (sold in 2007), MobileVoiceControl: the first full speech recognition system for smartphones (sold to Nuance Communications, Inc. in 2006), AskMeNow: a mobile search and information delivery system (sold to OTC:AKMN), Pocketscript: the first mobile electronic medical prescription system in the U.S. (sold to NASDAQ:ZIXI), and Adlink: an electronic advertising system (sold to Gannett Corp NASDAQ:GCI). Additionally, Burns designed and developed a Vehicle Suspension Parameter Measurement Machine for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.

This truck is bad ass to say the least. I’m looking forward to the RIDE."
2021-04-13 17:23:24,wallstreetbets,"You're getting downvoted but some of your points are true:

$RIDE is being sued in a class action for misleading investors. The original pre orders are non binding; I believe they changed to only binding pre-orders now. Some of the old pre-orders for large amount of trucks trace back to PO boxes or to an apartment, which just can't operate a fleet.

That being said I'm still watching it because a lot OP's research does make sense."

2021-04-13 19:36:37,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no.. I think the truck will get A LOT of PR from this weekend because it’s the first ever electric truck to do the race. I think it will create hype regardless. Upside seems higher for calls next Friday, although I personally just own shares"
2021-04-13 19:56:24,wallstreetbets,"I hope not, as I’ve been selling a bunch of 11.50 and 12 4/16s against my shares to lower my cost basis a bit."
2021-04-13 19:43:17,wallstreetbets,I have 4/16 12-12.5 Debits but I’m banking on the major 40%-100% pump to be next week. High risk high reward on both of these plays especially next weeks. Next week FD’s still dirt cheap the $15 and $12
2021-04-13 19:16:14,wallstreetbets,Nicely done 😂
2021-04-13 19:51:19,wallstreetbets,Neither one has airbags.
2021-04-13 19:40:57,wallstreetbets,"Well, for starters, he claims he put in a ""real order"" for a vehicle he's never seen, hasn't been built, has no airbags, has passed none of the government's mandated regulatory tests such as crash, mileage, etc. Doesn't even have airbags in the prototype. Prototype cannot be driven legally on US roads, etc. etc.

I think the ""customer point of view"" is that he's a moron. If he exists. Which he doesn't.

Also, the company is being currently sued and investigated by the SEC for claiming they have ""real orders."" Which forced the alleged CEO of the company to go on CNBC and make clear they have no real orders because they don't have a product."
2021-04-13 19:56:37,wallstreetbets,"Yup. In my days working on sites in the dead of winter, supes and foremen would sit in their truck with the heat on blast all day. Lots of wasted gas and wear/tear on the engine. Good on you for switching to electric, hopefully production of the higher class trucks will start to ramp up to meet the demand in the next few years. That's my one caveat with independent EVs right now - lots of great concepts and engineering, but very few have the capacity for manufacturing to meet demand. I foresee most being great long term investments unless something drastic changes this year."
2021-04-13 19:19:19,wallstreetbets,"In short, I like the truck."
2021-04-13 19:41:12,wallstreetbets,Ride will have plenty of emission credits...google Tesla emission credits and become acquainted with the subject. Ride gained access to the GM parts catalog to save on their own DD and manufacturing. Why pay someone for the stamping of a fender when they will sell it to you for 1/10th the cost of making your own. Ride is independent of GM just has access to parts and specs.
2021-04-13 18:06:28,wallstreetbets,">are you employed by Hindenberg or something? 

Don't give them ideas."
2021-04-13 18:38:05,wallstreetbets,"> It sounds like you either have puts

That’s not a valid argument. Your entire post reads like you are a bagholder (and surprise, you are). If he’s wrong or lying you should be able to easily address his concerns individually instead of linking to someone else’s old post."
2021-04-13 16:43:57,wallstreetbets,"Yea, no. Sorry. I have no time for you.

I'm just trying to save money on this BS pump and dump before they get the ""You invested all that money into a meme stock and lost it"" comments."
2021-04-13 17:53:28,wallstreetbets,It is. That guys smoking crack.
2021-04-13 16:51:37,wallstreetbets,"yeah, the farther out, the more you pay, you're paying for time"
2021-04-13 17:04:38,wallstreetbets,"Just a long dated call option... Typically one that expires over a year, but people use it loosely

2023 call option for Ride is the longest dated one you can get"
2021-04-13 17:44:53,wallstreetbets,you're on WSB and don't know what a leap is? did you get lost and wind up here?
2021-04-13 16:38:33,wallstreetbets,"Mass-Production starts in September, which is the biggest catalyst. So that’s why I like October. 

However, this weekend’s race will show the world that this truck is legit, so I think this weekend’s catalyst is huge too, and maybe next Friday could be a good bet.

Short term calls are a gamble, but then again, we love to gamble on this sub."
2021-04-13 18:50:23,wallstreetbets,Good luck :D
2021-04-13 16:40:58,wallstreetbets,have a helpful hand.
2021-04-13 18:27:25,wallstreetbets,"ya, the whole rape the earth to save the air is def a conundrum, i guess thats why i bought $RIDE instead of $LAC now that i think about it.

Not that i've ruled out LAC... but as far as timing goes, i would have been better off buying LAC, and selling half after it ran up to buy RIDE.  Especially at these prices.

As a consolation, i'll be happy being half-right as opposed to not right at all."
2021-04-13 18:31:41,wallstreetbets,"the united states is a poor measure to judge by, but i'll give you your point.  to that, i'll counter with - just think about being in on the ground floor before they do."
2021-04-13 19:48:41,wallstreetbets,this but unironically
2021-04-13 18:51:07,wallstreetbets,"That video was taken out of context. I’ve seen it 100 times. They don’t have any actual orders rn. Only pre-orders. But since the media freaked out about it, the CEO said in their last investor call that they will only be reporting real orders from now on.

I have spent 25+ hours researching this company. Demand is extremely robust for these trucks. Commercial fleets will buy these things like hot cakes. 

!RemindMe in 6 months - we can see all the orders that Lordstown has for their trucks."
2021-04-13 16:11:52,wallstreetbets,Hahaha love to hear it. Excited to be on this journey to the moon together 🤝
2021-04-13 17:17:50,wallstreetbets,"Low effort point, not worth an in-depth response"
2021-04-13 19:54:09,wallstreetbets,Are you expecting movement tomorrow?
2021-04-13 19:50:48,wallstreetbets,"Kinda wanna yolo this or PLTR you got me thinking though, I might play this Thursday/Friday if there’s little movement tomorrow."
2021-04-13 19:52:17,wallstreetbets,"I also have access to GM parts. All I have to do is go purchase them.

I am not therefore ""partnering"" with GM."
2021-04-13 18:43:18,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm. The post I linked was actually my post that I took the time to write up about 7 days ago. 

In my post, I address the whole Hindenburg report. Feel free to read!"
2021-04-13 16:53:30,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm. You’re calling this a pump and dump when it has the full support of the state of Ohio?

Literally do 5 minutes of research. The governor of Ohio, Secretary of State, senators, etc all support $RIDE. This is not a pump and dump. You definitely are short or have puts. 

Good luck getting burnt."
2021-04-13 16:53:37,wallstreetbets,So you're saying to do calls for October?
2021-04-13 17:47:05,wallstreetbets,"Why you being rude and hostile to new investors lol, fuck outta here asshole"
2021-04-13 17:09:12,wallstreetbets,"Question on that - if mass production starts in September, what is the actual catalyst? Is it successfully delivering the first orders? Photo ops/press releases? Reviews from buyers/journalists? 

I'm asking because part of me thinks that the catalyst here (assuming this is successful) will be more gradual and might not come to fruition for a few months. I was thinking about buying calls for Dec/Jan."
2021-04-13 18:14:21,wallstreetbets,Isn't the news about mass production already priced in?
2021-04-13 16:40:50,wallstreetbets,Gonna do $11 calls lol
2021-04-13 19:34:13,wallstreetbets,"this weekend’s race will show the world that this truck is legit

What if the 19-year-old kid driving it flips it and is killed, since the prototype doesn't even have airbags in it?

Then what?

Short it? Leap PUTS?"
2021-04-13 18:54:54,wallstreetbets,"I have a few hundred shares from a while back I got around 13 when I thought that was a good deal that I never sold when it ripped. 

I like RIDE long term"
2021-04-13 16:47:22,wallstreetbets,Thank you!emote:free\_emotes\_pack:trollfacecounting  on it🚀🚀🚀❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
2021-04-13 18:51:32,wallstreetbets,"I mean let's all be honest this company at its current price and valuation, with what it has to offer is undervalued. But undervalued in today's market. Not meaning much. I just think I'm personally going to get in small and exit early until I see some future."
2021-04-13 17:41:31,wallstreetbets,"Content-free response, not worth an in-depth rebuttal"
2021-04-13 19:56:51,wallstreetbets,"Yes I think with the video they put out today being all over social media, tomorrow will be a big day. The CEO of Camping World just tweeted it out as well:

https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1382116570978078723?s=21"
2021-04-13 19:15:44,wallstreetbets,The person you replied to made no mention of the Hindenburg report. Sounds like you are avoiding fair criticisms like the plague. Extremely sus.
2021-04-13 17:07:01,wallstreetbets,"You're really starting to come off as the kind of guy who couldn't figure out a connect-the-dots puzzle if it was literally only two dots.

They're getting $500 million from the SPAC to build a manufacturing facility. It doesn't take a genius to wonder why Ohio would support RIDE. They're not invested in it. It's not their money. But the money will go into Ohio and create jobs. 

Nikola II is what this will be."
2021-04-13 16:59:54,wallstreetbets,i'm saying thats something to consider when you make your decisions. i would never tell you what to do since i'm not you.
2021-04-13 18:49:12,wallstreetbets,Not financial advise...but if you go with Oct and they have a set back of a couple weeks on production you will wish you would have paid the time premium and went to Dec 2021 or Jan 2022 when they are in full swing production. \^..\^
2021-04-13 18:53:25,wallstreetbets,Hey be nice everyone! We’re all here to make money!!
2021-04-13 18:19:45,wallstreetbets,"i beg your pardon? that was neither rude, nor hostile.  It was a pretty obvious question to anyone else i believe.

you sir, are rude and hostile calling me an asshole."
2021-04-13 17:14:44,wallstreetbets,"I think that’s a very good point. In fact, bigger catalysts will likely be when they start to report actual binding orders from customers. Right now, they are pre-production, so they can’t take actual orders, but it sounds like demand is robust.

I would say January 2022 calls would be a great way to play this as well. I don’t really mess around with options, I prefer to just buy shares. But January 2022 would be solid I think!"
2021-04-13 18:54:13,wallstreetbets,Mass production was priced in at 31.80 but that is not the current price... \^..\^
2021-04-13 19:36:53,wallstreetbets,A dollar above the 52-wk low?
2021-04-13 19:24:31,wallstreetbets,"The person I replied to made accusations based on the content from within the Hindenburg report. It’s obvious he/she got his/her information from Hindenburg’s report.

Had that person done their own research, they would see why they are incorrect.

The only extremely Sus thing here is you, my friend."
2021-04-13 17:12:22,wallstreetbets,"Yes.. to your point.. Lordstown’s plant will create jobs.. so Ohio will make sure they have the necessary capital and resources to produce trucks.. 

They’re in the final DD stage of the ATVM loan, which Tesla got some time ago.

I think you’re starting to put together the pieces of the puzzle on why this isn’t a pump and dump! Nice!"
2021-04-13 17:00:48,wallstreetbets,"Ape no understand, Ape understand you are not financial advisor"
2021-04-13 18:27:00,wallstreetbets,"You framed your question condescendingly, as well as pushing the notion I don't belong here lol


 I wound up here like a lot of newcomers during the GME wave where this sub had the most traffic its ever had to answer your question"
2021-04-13 18:27:45,wallstreetbets,I do appreciate your advice earlier!!!
2021-04-13 19:53:38,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure if you're aware, but they announced that they were under SEC ~~investigation~~ inquiry last month. That news is much more recent than their announcement of plans for mass production and is a contributing factor in the current price. From what I can see, there were mentions of their mass production plans as far back as November, and there was a corresponding spike in price around that time as well."
2021-04-13 19:59:36,wallstreetbets,He is saying buy with more days to expiration not FDs in case it doesn’t moon. Theta will have sex with you if it doesn’t moon. Or just buy shares it looks like a good entry!
2021-04-13 19:00:41,wallstreetbets,"i was going to let it go, but you've decided to characterize me yet again.  This is why i suspect you're just trolling for attention. Its not condescension.  Nor did I suggest you didn't belong just because ''you wound up here.""  You made that association.  I'd welcome any wanderer in search of knowledge, anywhere.  Not the point.  Deflection.

 But, as you claim now, that you came to this sub what is now months ago, during that whole time reading all the posts, you had not yet come to any understanding of options, but could do the ape routine pretty well, it just doesn't jibe.  Gave me the cognitive dissonance willies.

You can call me suspicious.  Even cynical.  Unwelcoming? Not. Unless you're a manipulator and then all i'm gonna do is point out what i think like everyone else, and go about my business.

I hope you learn a lot and have a good life."
2021-04-13 18:50:32,wallstreetbets,Cant wait for these people to lose a little money and disappear from the sub
2021-04-13 19:08:26,wallstreetbets,"I was in search of knowledge as evidenced by my question, I acknowledge that I was reactionary but you gotta admit it too"
2021-04-13 19:42:45,wallstreetbets,Losing money is all I know how to do... I love to lose money 💰
2021-04-13 18:57:49,wallstreetbets,Ok bub
2021-04-13 15:44:01,wallstreetbets,Is this a joke? 2% gains on shares?
2021-04-13 17:00:58,wallstreetbets,I am very bullish on BABA. I thought it could be bad for a while. But I now think we will see 300  a share soon.
2021-04-13 17:55:05,wallstreetbets,I'm with you brother. bag holding since $60s and averaging up.
2021-04-13 17:57:39,wallstreetbets,I dont actually hold  BABA. But if I wanted to add a stock to my holdings BABA would be top 3 right now.

2021-04-13 16:02:20,wallstreetbets,"I was considering SDC and even went to an appointment for a free evaluation. After that, I started reading reviews and found that there are a lot of people out there who have had bad experiences with SDC, that their product does not address all the same problems as Invisalign, that Invisalign includes dentist follow ups that identify problems early on instead of letting them progress. SDC are a discount brand in a business where quality matters a lot to most people."
2021-04-13 17:10:43,wallstreetbets,"I researched both when I had my teeth fixed and went with invisalign after seeing a lot of negative experiences with SDC.

2021-04-13 16:00:33,wallstreetbets,"No brozzer, you are not fucked"
2021-04-13 16:07:27,wallstreetbets,High chance you can sell off a bunch of these Thursday
2021-04-13 16:16:47,wallstreetbets,You’re good
2021-04-13 16:27:23,wallstreetbets,"Some are pretty far out. It could go either way. Stonks go up, options go plateau."
2021-04-13 16:39:00,wallstreetbets,These will all print
2021-04-13 16:58:34,wallstreetbets,Welcome to charity
2021-04-13 15:24:32,wallstreetbets,Should’ve snatched up some $24 4/23 calls. EZ $$$
2021-04-13 19:30:44,wallstreetbets,You'll be fine. Believe you mofo
2021-04-13 15:10:02,wallstreetbets,"Sell before the event, play the hype"
2021-04-13 15:27:05,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-13 19:09:29,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino."
2021-04-13 16:07:40,wallstreetbets,And PLTR usually dumps on good news too.
2021-04-13 16:29:41,wallstreetbets,One is in like 9 months and another in 1 year and 9 months. You ain’t got no crystal ball.
2021-04-13 18:03:34,wallstreetbets,LEAPs.  These will print.
2021-04-13 19:17:10,wallstreetbets,As someone who went balls deep in atm leaps a couple months ago I would love to know why deep would have been better. For next time lol
2021-04-13 15:36:47,wallstreetbets,Theyre long 2023
2021-04-13 15:13:09,wallstreetbets,From experience it should rocket during the day tomorrow and then sell of during the event
2021-04-13 15:45:47,wallstreetbets,It’s always easy in hindsight.
2021-04-13 15:12:17,wallstreetbets,That’s too conservative for our friend here. Just look how far OTM his calls are. He may miss out on some serious gains if they release some good stuff.
2021-04-13 17:58:56,wallstreetbets,Buy puts?
2021-04-13 16:47:51,wallstreetbets,I have 2 of them in fact
2021-04-13 15:48:46,wallstreetbets,"But, if your confident enough it'll go up a ton by 2023, why not buy slightly less OTM to make more profit?  Your already paying so much time value"
2021-04-13 16:07:07,wallstreetbets,"I hope so but i still closed out before 4:00pm. Gonna get back in at open barely OTM. If you like losing money you should do the same, my plays are as consistent as they are bad"
2021-04-13 15:15:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah the 22/23 calls he’s just going to have to hold
2021-04-13 16:08:25,wallstreetbets,Because deeper OTM is ‘cheaper’
2021-04-13 16:10:21,wallstreetbets,"Penny wise, dollar foolish.  All the negatives of FDs without the ability to get massive leverage."
2021-04-13 16:13:14,wallstreetbets,"Wait, it’s dumb reasoning but how is it all the negatives of FDs?

I’m new to options but isn’t the lower theta part of what you’re paying for in the premium? If you didn’t time things right you can keep holding it?"
2021-04-13 16:16:13,wallstreetbets,"It was an exageration, but basically it has both a lower chance to actually print and lower delta compared to a lower priced option.   Yes, theta decay is slower"
2021-04-13 15:07:15,wallstreetbets,Talk about being late to the party lol
2021-04-13 15:10:10,wallstreetbets,Do the smart thing and sell weekly CCs on that.
2021-04-13 15:28:23,wallstreetbets,"This is smart investing in my opinion.. I play this out usually with SPACs, game stop is a war behind a screen"
2021-04-13 15:43:57,wallstreetbets,*welcome*
2021-04-13 15:52:46,wallstreetbets,Loool
2021-04-13 15:43:35,wallstreetbets,Excited to see this loss porn 😍
2021-04-13 15:10:27,wallstreetbets,No one cares
2021-04-13 18:23:31,wallstreetbets,Thems the plan. I thought to try it since the premiums are so juicy. Do you think it’s a good idea to do this regularly on the current hottest stock going forward?
2021-04-13 15:27:07,wallstreetbets,Yous prolly a broke ass beech
2021-04-13 18:34:47,wallstreetbets,"I am selling CC on it. Using the premium to buy more shares, and if they get called away, sell puts at or under your CC strike, and use the put premium to buy more shares. Got almost 15 shares for 'free' doing it this week and only doing CC's/CSPs with 25% of my GME position. It's exclusively how I am growing my GME position. And it drops the cost basis on my Hodl 75% because they are just free shares"
2021-04-13 18:36:15,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, if you sell $100+ OTM with 1 week till expiry, that’s like $350 a week. If it jumps big, like say it goes up to $200 at the beginning of next week, you could roll it slightly up and out to a point where you’re comfortable letting go or to a point that’s a net even trade. 

I’ve got two lots I’ve been doing this on for the past 3 weeks or so and have made ~$3k doing it (and that’s with being fairly conservative with my strikes). I’d wait it out this week though, IV is on the low side for what it has been and I have a feeling we might see a run up next week. Or you can pick your strike and just set a limit order for the premium you’re happy collecting, just make sure to be aggressive with your offer considering IV and current price."
2021-04-13 15:28:47,wallstreetbets,Im just someone whose been here from 2018 and is sick of seeing these posts everyday for the last 5 months.
2021-04-13 15:11:05,wallstreetbets,All these TSLA posts are giving me some FOMO for not buying options when it first dipped like I was thinking about
2021-04-13 15:11:18,wallstreetbets,Congratulations
2021-04-13 16:20:28,wallstreetbets,Heard the new TSLA model S doesn’t have turn signals.
2021-04-13 15:15:01,wallstreetbets,Bruh that’s 8k gain on a 100k position ...8% is pretty nomie innit
2021-04-13 15:20:10,wallstreetbets,Lol actual retard
2021-04-13 15:49:25,wallstreetbets,"What’s wrong with 8 %? That’s great profit, innit"
2021-04-13 16:02:55,wallstreetbets,"He bought TSLA shares

This is like the least retarded play in this sub"
2021-04-13 15:51:53,wallstreetbets,If I had 100k to invest I won’t be that delighted by 8k...it’s like you made 8 bucks on a 100.  20% is a great profit by my standards and a few others I know...maybe you have diff expectations fella innit
2021-04-13 17:04:58,wallstreetbets,No for posting such small gains on such large capital
2021-04-13 15:58:13,wallstreetbets,"You must be a new investor, but that’s alright bud. Lol everyone is getting use to these 20% gains like its normal. I hope this bull run lasts for years but it won’t always be like this. If 20% was a standard gain everyone would be rich. Innit

Also making 8 bucks on 100 is the same as making 80k on a million percentage wise. Get ur bank up and u will know what I’m talkin about. Ull love a 8 percent gain when u have enough money"
2021-04-13 18:01:14,wallstreetbets,He’s happy with his gains and that’s fine

2021-04-13 15:00:40,wallstreetbets,wonder if its possible to get the actual stock certificate from the company?
2021-04-13 16:44:52,wallstreetbets,"Lol, so memes aside, do people still think this is going to the moon? Not that I'm thinking of selling, holding is free and I don't need the cash."
2021-04-13 15:06:18,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-13 15:12:27,wallstreetbets,Congrats and good luck! You've definitely bought at some interesting moment. LOL
2021-04-13 17:15:52,wallstreetbets,this is the way!

2021-04-13 17:40:47,wallstreetbets,We love the dip so bring it on hedgies. Hedgies don’t want to give out those below $100 discount sales on GME anymore. I guess I will have to buy more at what they are now.
2021-04-13 18:36:14,wallstreetbets,God damn!
2021-04-13 18:42:49,wallstreetbets,True 💎👐 nice job averaging down too

2021-04-13 17:56:57,wallstreetbets,"This is what you do when you got a sweet amount of shares, OP"
2021-04-13 15:44:40,wallstreetbets,This is the way.  I've been getting $500/wk (per contract) selling way OTM weekly calls.  My other stocks would be more like $5/wk.
2021-04-13 19:44:27,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't... with a squeeze looming - timing could get you in trouble
2021-04-13 17:06:00,wallstreetbets,"In short: yes, very much so. Time horizon? No idea."
2021-04-13 18:16:29,wallstreetbets,"No, this already went to the moon and now is coming crashing back to earth to rest for good."

2021-04-13 14:46:36,wallstreetbets,Whens demo day anyways
2021-04-13 15:16:24,wallstreetbets,Did it soar during demo day last time or was it just the hype before?
2021-04-13 17:19:18,wallstreetbets,"Still holding my 4/16 spreads and my 5/7 spreads. 

&#x200B;

thought about adding another 5k worth of shares in PM but got sidetracked at work and then kept waiting for a pullback that surprisingly DIDN'T HAPPEN.

So un-PLTR of PLTR."
2021-04-13 16:25:23,wallstreetbets,"Bought FD this morning, closed my May CCs around lunch and closed my 4/16 CSP this afternoon.

2021-04-13 15:58:38,wallstreetbets,How do you unlock calls on TD Ameritrade. Says I can’t do it
2021-04-13 16:19:46,wallstreetbets,It went up 10% today and you didn’t sell EOD?! Bruh...
2021-04-13 16:34:39,wallstreetbets,Holding 1/21/22 22c up 27% how long you holding for? I think I should try to exit tomorrow during the hype????

2021-04-13 18:58:15,wallstreetbets,"PLTR will be in the HIGH $26 tomorrow morning in the premarket. Insiders and hedge funds will short the hell out of it, taking it below $24 at open. 

Let's see how many of you trade this..."
2021-04-13 14:55:11,wallstreetbets,I heard demo day won’t do shit to pltr
2021-04-13 16:01:18,wallstreetbets,"I probably sold you one of them, hope it pays off, we’ll both be happy!"
2021-04-13 17:00:54,wallstreetbets,"yeah, i have a $30 and $35 that haven't shown ANY life until, like, today. Really tired of rolling shit over. For once, i'd like to close in the green."
2021-04-13 18:23:00,wallstreetbets,Excitement run up today. Momentum will keep tomorrow part of the day. Post demo day open will have volatility and if demo day is well received a major jump. This could set a new floor of support too.
2021-04-13 16:29:16,wallstreetbets,"Hello from /r/thetagang, I likely sold you those calls."
2021-04-13 16:26:23,wallstreetbets,"I sold 8 covered calls yesterday at 24.5, 25, 25.5

Woops"
2021-04-13 16:10:14,wallstreetbets,"It’s funny, I was just looking at a 4/16 CC I sold to open and it was like 96% profit and I could’ve bought it back for $4, but I was like, nah, let’s see what it do. Then it do what it did, but I’m happy. I’d rather have bought it back cheap as dirt and sold a new contract tomorrow though."
2021-04-13 15:46:52,wallstreetbets,Should’ve closed it last week knowing demo day was tomorrow and the inevitable run up. Depends on your expiry though if you got time expecting a drop off a little bit after.
2021-04-13 15:12:17,wallstreetbets,The IV is extremely low
2021-04-13 14:52:23,wallstreetbets,"Tmrw, double click day"
2021-04-13 15:59:03,wallstreetbets,It did soar during demo last time but that was also cause of the GME hype at the time
2021-04-13 19:09:08,wallstreetbets,Bearish or bullish spreads? Seems like a rough day for PLTR theta gang. I totally misplayed my CCs.
2021-04-13 16:35:07,wallstreetbets,"Under the General tab, you'll see your approval status for *options* trading. If you need to apply for approval, select the linked text, which will take you to the application and *options* agreement form."

2021-04-13 16:41:58,wallstreetbets,"If the demo day is enough to wow me and show potential industry contracts, I’ll hold. I’d like to hold til their earnings and see them get more analyst coverage because right now there’s not much and it’s mostly negative"

2021-04-13 15:57:31,wallstreetbets,Its already doing something for pltr?  What are you talking about?

2021-04-13 16:43:02,wallstreetbets,I'll buy both you a drink if it reaches 30
2021-04-13 17:43:38,wallstreetbets,"On my 4/16 calls I went balls deep just yesterday on the dip, so I saw gains instantly. The leaps I bought few months back are still under water"

2021-04-13 16:59:25,wallstreetbets,"not so fast, i have a $30 and a $35."
2021-04-13 19:36:15,wallstreetbets,Why sell calls on a red day 2 days before a catalyst?
2021-04-13 19:50:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah similar boat; can't get a good price on rolling up and out either.  I guess I will accept being exercised and buy back in or wheel back in if I have to.  It'll probably have some sort of dip in the next month or two anyways, and since I've been selling 7-14 dte ccs, my time basis is near zero anyways.  IVs are kind of low across the board; should have waited to sell ccs."
2021-04-13 15:55:26,wallstreetbets,It expires this friday
2021-04-13 15:55:51,wallstreetbets,Who knows? Chances are itll drop tomorrow after the last minute hype-surge today.
2021-04-13 15:26:45,wallstreetbets,"It’s 75 for me, after this thing, who knows what it’ll be."
2021-04-13 15:16:46,wallstreetbets,for now.
2021-04-13 14:58:41,wallstreetbets,Thank you💓
2021-04-13 16:08:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I sold my 4/16 calls. If DTE was further out then I’d hold through but you know why it’s called FD
2021-04-13 17:54:46,wallstreetbets,I did that awhile ago and even got the approval email
2021-04-13 16:57:49,wallstreetbets,When is earnings?
2021-04-13 16:59:34,wallstreetbets,Also I can’t keep track of how it goes because I’ll be at work. Is there a good resource to be ahead with news before a potential sell of happens ?
2021-04-13 15:58:18,wallstreetbets,So ur saying it’s gonna rocket tomorrow?
2021-04-13 17:54:39,wallstreetbets,Remind me 3 days
2021-04-13 17:44:57,wallstreetbets,very nice

2021-04-13 15:55:59,wallstreetbets,"I didn't think it through, I would have sold a higher strike if I knew Double Click was tomorrow"
2021-04-13 15:28:29,wallstreetbets,That’s pretty low. Last few days it was in mid 60s and maybe 3 weeks ago was 90s-100
2021-04-13 15:26:55,wallstreetbets,What makes 75 IV low?
2021-04-13 18:03:23,wallstreetbets,Give them a call is all I can add. Good Luck!
2021-04-13 17:05:26,wallstreetbets,TD Ameritrade says may 4 but sometimes that’s a little off
2021-04-13 17:06:53,wallstreetbets,"I plan to just watch the demo day, I signed up for it. But since your call is so far out, why not just sell weekly calls at a higher strike price say 20% OTM and do diagonal spreads?"
2021-04-13 15:59:40,wallstreetbets,I dont know what it's to do tomorrow.  I know it made a significant move up today as a result of demo day tomorrow.  Are you suggesting it just went up arbitrarily today and demo had nothing to do with it?
2021-04-13 17:22:53,wallstreetbets,$30s about to print heavy for the retards
2021-04-13 17:10:17,wallstreetbets,"to be fair, i bought these March 1 haha"

2021-04-13 15:44:28,wallstreetbets,"Not drastically, no. Maybe if the IV picks up tomorrow it could get crushed later on though."
2021-04-13 16:01:52,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it went up today because of demo day.  I cant say 100% for sure it'll go higher tomorrow, but I'd wager on it, thats why I bought calls yesterday.  Nothing in this market is a guarantee, but if tomorrow is anything like today, its gonna be nice for my calls."

2021-04-13 14:45:51,wallstreetbets,The best part about a jnj yolo is that all you ever have to do now is just buy big dips and hold and you’ll be set for life after about 35 years!  Congrats!
2021-04-13 15:13:21,wallstreetbets,Right after this I looked up JNJ and the first thing was an article about suspending the vaccine over blood clot concerns
2021-04-13 15:20:20,wallstreetbets,ur fucked their vax is crap

2021-04-13 14:52:19,wallstreetbets,3dte if these print OP won't need to wait long.
2021-04-13 15:50:39,wallstreetbets,"Correct. They also had asbestos in their baby powered couple years ago and didn’t really affect their price at all. I’m staying away out of principle, but they’re so big their vax fail probably doesn’t even matter"
2021-04-13 17:53:28,wallstreetbets,There's talk that the JNJ vaccine actually had no relation to the blood clots. All 6 people that had those symptoms were women between the ages of 18-45. Could have been caused by child-bearing or birthcontrol. We'll see
2021-04-13 15:00:08,wallstreetbets,"According to WSB rules, this technically isn't a yolo, but I'm just thankful that it's not another gme post.

Then there's also the dude that's been trying to post dd that turned $4k into $440k.

Fuck the retarded apes that are not only costing themselves, but also og wsbers serious tendies."

2021-04-13 17:23:01,wallstreetbets,"Mainstream stocks just suck. I dont get the hype. Watched a video last night about a so called ""analysis"". Tesla sold 5 k more cars than expected, stock will be at 10 k to 20 k in 2024... 

What are those people talking about... PE of 1000000 or what?
Volkswagen (with its brands) is selling more EVs than Tesla... and actually makes money with its cars.

Can somebody explain that level of hype? 
I actually like Tesla a lot, but it all seems a bit much."
2021-04-13 14:44:26,wallstreetbets,dont. shit cars
2021-04-13 15:00:45,wallstreetbets,"If I cum am I done, or I get a 2nd round ?"
2021-04-13 18:23:28,wallstreetbets,"Volkswagen has over 100 factories worldwide, 80% of which will be near useless without significant $$$$ invested over the next 10 years.

BEV upfront cost parity is about 4-6 years away. Meaning consumer demand is going to go GME over EVs very soon. Gas cars will be something that only rich people will drive soon, especially if the price and inflation issues keep up.

VW cannot come close to sustaining its business without gas car revenue, whereas Tesla has been cash flow positive for nearly two years without selling a single gas car.

Tesla is also in a better position with debt and pension obligations than all other western automakers.

Even with these facts, VW is better positioned that practically every other legacy auto maker out there."
2021-04-13 17:29:27,wallstreetbets,"Volkswagen numbers included plug-in hybrids and hybrids. Right?

Tesla still owns a the global position. Double Volkswagen position."
2021-04-13 17:28:54,wallstreetbets,Something something... battery factories... future priced in... I don't get it either.

2021-04-13 17:59:31,wallstreetbets,"I did read the english and german report... sounds like pure EV to me (but I could be wrong, did not look at the numbers in detail).

I think that too, Tesla has a great brand. Dont see that brand driving a lot in Italy, Germany or France... but time will tell.

If Tesla would build 2x as much cars as Volkswagen its evaluation would still be wrong today, right? And it is not even close. Also, they dont make money on cars right now, if Co2 certificates are gone because other brands are building EVs its not good for Tesla.

If Tesla would cost 3000 $ today would you repeat the same arguement to tell me why? If yes, it is not worth anything, right? Because the evaluation is not a result of your reasoning.

... again, I like the company. I just liked them more when they were not the cool kid in town.

Its all based on Kathy Woods story of Tesla cars that will pay for themselfs by sending them out with a cab mode (would not send out my car that way, but ok).
Not saying its impossible, but a big big ""if"", right?
I do not see that as possibility by current laws in any country as well. 

Am I missing something? 
So... many ""if""s in the way, but great future? For sure. A 3 trillion dollar company? Bitch please."
2021-04-13 17:38:39,wallstreetbets,"I do get the growth story, its perfectly fine, but when it then grows like expected people applaude like Jesus came to the super bowl to show some backflips on alligators, just to argue it should therefore be even higher.

I am pretty sure those ""experts"" have some very nice call options before they go on tv. 
Everybody here knows its speculation (and we all know that can be a lot of fun), I dont think everybody out there knows it as well. They are just getting fed by the main stream media.

Is that opinion too hard? 
Any other opinions?"

2021-04-13 17:14:45,wallstreetbets,There is too many people and we need more plagues. Bring back Covid! Traffic already sucks again.
2021-04-13 18:53:13,wallstreetbets,I've been buying shares this whole dip to make up for it.
2021-04-13 17:59:52,wallstreetbets,There’s not too many people we just consume way too much of the wrong stuff in the wrong way... nothing is sustainable when it should be people just don’t want to lose the empires they’ve established in shit like auto industry and oil and energy meat etc.. a clean green oriented future would be suitable for this global population and even larger ones as it uses space better... to each his or her own though
2021-04-13 19:54:50,wallstreetbets,If you're lucky there is some kinda trigger for volatility and you gain some of your lost theta value back with IV value. Or just hope it goes way ITM I guess lol.
2021-04-13 14:05:41,wallstreetbets,I like the work and respect it
2021-04-13 17:57:29,wallstreetbets,Solvent by how much? What's the equity to long debt ratio like?
2021-04-13 19:42:12,wallstreetbets,"I see total assets of 2.3 billion and total liabilities of 500 million. Long term debt to equity is 8.5%.

The current ratio is 1.43 so I suppose some of their assets aren't that liquid."
2021-04-13 14:16:03,wallstreetbets,“I tried to invest in GME but they didn’t want to pay me a $1 royalty for every game sold and now they’re dead to me.”
2021-04-13 13:51:58,wallstreetbets,"If GameStop were on shark tank, sounds like we’ve got two sharks ready to invest! 🦈"

He's saying that long-term, this is a good stock to own and that the short thesis of driving this down to $0 is absolutely off the table.

2021-04-13 14:52:47,wallstreetbets,"He's right. The folks who claim that $GME's fundamentals didn't change much between pre-Jan and post-Jan are dead wrong, just the brand itself got much stronger."

2021-04-13 15:01:22,wallstreetbets,Well there goes my chance of hoping it would dip down to $40 a share again so I could YOLO some more tax return money at it. Guess I'll just have to hold tight to what I have and wait to see what happens next.
2021-04-13 16:22:52,wallstreetbets,Kevin has a plastic smile. Can't tell if it's because he's a landlord or untrustworthy?

2021-04-13 14:13:19,wallstreetbets,"If they wanna draw in foot traffic at their locations, they should openly and actively advertise selling TCG cards and give more focus to card games. I know some locations already do this with Pokémon preorder cards , but they should extend it to Yugioh too. You wouldn't believe how many pissed off disappointed moments i've had going to a local Walmart or Target, only to find out the ENTIRE stock of trading cards is sold out. They even end up selling out at Game Stops that do this already too."

2021-04-13 17:40:55,wallstreetbets,Of course a second wind is coming. It’s income tax return season.
2021-04-13 17:42:19,wallstreetbets,The upside is limitless.

 Yes Kevin it is a pleasure to meet a fellow Kevin!"
2021-04-13 17:49:36,wallstreetbets,"""Shorts are hurting"" tells me Kevin also believes they haven't covered 

That's some tasty confirmation bias"
2021-04-13 17:52:19,wallstreetbets,Amazing
2021-04-13 17:55:55,wallstreetbets,Cubin & O'Leary... Now we just need Lori and Daymond to fill out our Shark Tank bingo card.
2021-04-13 17:58:33,wallstreetbets,"But..but, i just read The Motley Fool's daily article saying it was going to crash."
2021-04-13 18:05:26,wallstreetbets,"O'leary is just supporting GME since he wants to pitch hit shitty auto-investing company to all you retards. Don't follow him, but keep on holding"
2021-04-13 18:07:32,wallstreetbets,Man that interviewer is dumb as a bag of bricks
2021-04-13 18:18:07,wallstreetbets,"Two words.

2021-04-13 18:25:55,wallstreetbets,Damn straight there is a second kick of life in it.
2021-04-13 18:25:59,wallstreetbets,Understatement of a lifetime.
2021-04-13 18:32:05,wallstreetbets,"More manipulation, why do I feel mr wonderful bought at $350 a share?"
2021-04-13 18:35:06,wallstreetbets,All in 4/16 800C LFG!
2021-04-13 18:42:11,wallstreetbets,"You know who else wants a second kick of life?

The people who he killed when he drunk drove his boat into theirs."

2021-04-13 19:09:50,wallstreetbets,The guy on the left looks like young hipster Tim Allen. The guy on the right looks like business Dr. Phil.
2021-04-13 19:42:42,wallstreetbets,Not news to me 💥💥💥💥💥
2021-04-13 19:49:02,wallstreetbets,Are you just trying to make me hungry for more nanners? Tomorrow is pay day.
2021-04-13 19:53:24,wallstreetbets,What if GameStop made a gaming ETF
2021-04-13 19:55:30,wallstreetbets,It won't go up much this week...they need those 40000 plus options contracts to expire worthless
2021-04-13 19:55:32,wallstreetbets,My man! Mister Wonderful! Most people I talk to hate this guy but I couldn't be happier with the king shark himself.
2021-04-13 19:56:07,wallstreetbets,Mr. Wonderful is an ape holy shit !
2021-04-13 14:48:58,wallstreetbets,"Same guy who let his wife get hammered and drive their boat at night into another couple, [killing them in the process](https://torontolife.com/life/what-really-happened-the-night-of-the-oleary-boat-crash-in-muskoka/)?  Definitely a guy I want to be taking advice from"
2021-04-13 14:55:15,wallstreetbets,"The amount of people who do not understand the first thing about stocks while touting GME in this thread is both scary and hilarious. 

The upside is limitless, like every single stock. He’s not making a statement about GME, but rather noting that caution is necessary when shorting, due to the unlimited downside."
2021-04-13 15:10:37,wallstreetbets,Do you guys REALLY trust this guy?  Lol fuck
2021-04-13 14:25:24,wallstreetbets,He’s probably shorting though lol I don’t trust the dude
2021-04-13 14:14:02,wallstreetbets,"I can't stand O'Leary, but I love me some confirmation bias!"
2021-04-13 15:45:00,wallstreetbets,This guy is a con artist fuck him.
2021-04-13 14:20:27,wallstreetbets,"So Kevin O’Leary is in, bias confirmed, holding to the moon!!"
2021-04-13 14:35:42,wallstreetbets,The comparison to Netflix is perfect.
2021-04-13 14:35:55,wallstreetbets,please... come back for us apes that got in at 300
2021-04-13 15:04:37,wallstreetbets,Who is the guy on the left? And where do I find his content

2021-04-13 15:05:37,wallstreetbets,"Bruh I almost passed the fuck out out

2 reasons:

The absolute unscrupulous incredulity of some mfs &

Seeing the truth come to light in real time is always a breathtaking affair"
2021-04-13 15:08:34,wallstreetbets,"So, buy more GME? Got it."
2021-04-13 16:09:47,wallstreetbets,"As a Canadian I’ll say I fucking hate Kevin O’Leary, keep the piece of shit."
2021-04-13 18:52:41,wallstreetbets,"In other words, he bought in"
2021-04-13 19:30:01,wallstreetbets,"THIS IS BULLISH AS FUCK!!! LET'S GO!!!  


The questions is... When the hell are the shorts going to cover?!? Do they even intend to cover their position???"
2021-04-13 14:49:00,wallstreetbets,"Oleary is an idiot. Anyone listening to anything he says, you get what you deserve"
2021-04-13 14:58:05,wallstreetbets,This Meet Kevin dude is such a twat
2021-04-13 15:57:37,wallstreetbets,"I'd trust a wet fart from a loose seagull over this useless cunt. 

O'Leary is a fraud and I don't trust whatever angle he's pushing."
2021-04-13 14:47:19,wallstreetbets,"I hope GameStop goes to 69420, but kevin oleary has been wrong on so many things tho :("
2021-04-13 15:55:40,wallstreetbets,"Kevin O’Leary is a POS. Don’t give this guy the time of day. He’s just leeching.

[Here he is saying 3.5 billion people in poverty is fantastic news.](https://youtu.be/AuqemytQ5QA)"
2021-04-13 14:33:56,wallstreetbets,looks fake
2021-04-13 14:38:43,wallstreetbets,The interviewer could not stop smiling haha
2021-04-13 14:18:17,wallstreetbets,We all love Kevin because he tells it like it is even if it hurts peoples feelings. Woot woot Kevin!
2021-04-13 17:26:41,wallstreetbets,Kevin O'Leary is a sack of shit.  He can choke on  it.
2021-04-13 15:16:00,wallstreetbets,"I have a couple GameStop shares cost basis 180, this doesn’t make me bullish. It sounds like Kevin O’Leary has a GameStop position he wants to push, just like the hedgies had short positions they wanted to push.

GameStop could do a lot of things, but how much progress has there actually been in that direction? The writing has been on the walls for physical media for half a decade, and I’ve seen little to suggest the stock’s market cap is deserving

I don’t like the stock, I like the market conditions. Don’t try to push the actual brand lol"
2021-04-13 14:53:07,wallstreetbets,"Bias is confirmed 

&#x200B;

Tits are jacked

&#x200B;

Hedges are fucked"
2021-04-13 13:46:47,wallstreetbets,How much did he pay him to say this? I’ve heard Mr wonderful’s opinions can be bought
2021-04-13 14:18:40,wallstreetbets,We love you Mr Wonderful
2021-04-13 14:22:51,wallstreetbets,Upside is limitless.. sounds like Tesla
2021-04-13 14:31:50,wallstreetbets,Are we really confident this means buy now?
2021-04-13 16:03:30,wallstreetbets,"Don't call us the "" Robinhood"" crowd.

That got under my skin"
2021-04-13 16:45:12,wallstreetbets,He murdered a woman while drinking and driving. Why is he on tv why isn’t he in jail
2021-04-13 17:52:38,wallstreetbets,"Guess who just entered a giant bullish position?! Lmfao, this prick couldn’t be more transparent. Where was Kevin O’Leary all this time while the share price was floundering? Smh"
2021-04-13 18:29:00,wallstreetbets,This guys a sleezeball that wants you to think he’s on your side. I remember when threads were full of people shitting on this guy. You fools will upvote anything that confirms your bias
2021-04-13 18:41:28,wallstreetbets,He’s a fucking tool and a fraud.
2021-04-13 18:59:27,wallstreetbets,"The comparison to Netflix is interesting.

The difference is, it was obvious that it was possible to deliver movies and TV shows digitally.  The only obstacle was technological.  They were hard problems, for sure, but technological problems are always solvable if you have the right people.

I have seen no hint of how GameStop (or any third party) can deliver console games digitally since the digital delivery is owned by the console manufacturers, who have absolutely no reason to let anyone else in.  Their problem is not technological, it's a business problem, and no mention has been made of anything resembling a business plan.

Of course PC games can be delivered digitally but taking on Steam would be a huge uphill battle.  Many (much bigger companies, including Amazon) have tried and Steam still has 75% market share or whatever."
2021-04-13 19:19:49,wallstreetbets, “I tried to invest in GME but they didn’t want to pay me a $1 royalty for every game sold and now they’re dead to me.”
2021-04-13 19:38:11,wallstreetbets,Clown
2021-04-13 17:47:57,wallstreetbets,"I can't imagine having anyone better to listen to than Mr. Wonderful. In the past 2-3 decades he has:

Scammed Mattel to the point of bankruptcy with the worst M&A transaction ever;

Created a shitty investment management firm that returned loss after loss before selling it to a friend;

Created several shitty PE funds that have closed down and also provided nothing but loss to his clients;

Created some of the most boring ETFs that are as safe as you can get, where even his small-caps' is losing to the SPY YTD; and

Used to lie about being a billionaire.

Glad to see he's opining on the market."
2021-04-13 15:42:53,wallstreetbets,"O’Leary is a smart dude. Some might find him to be a dick but he’s a good dude and smart as a hell. 

My favorite quote of his is “Money is my military, each dollar a soldier. I never send my money into battle unprepared and undefended. I send it to conquer and take currency prisoner and bring it back to me.”"
2021-04-13 17:56:01,wallstreetbets,And now you cultists think he is the smartest man alive because now he confirms your beliefs.
2021-04-13 15:07:47,wallstreetbets,/u/talltexandad1836
2021-04-13 15:12:40,wallstreetbets,AMC is dangerous as well.  They just didn’t mention it
2021-04-13 15:12:54,wallstreetbets,Lol it’s like waiting for the messiah....any day now
2021-04-13 15:15:54,wallstreetbets,"Over the past year I have become more and more a fan of O'leary. Smart and legit celebrity.

2021-04-13 15:16:39,wallstreetbets,mr wonderful is a smart dude
2021-04-13 15:17:08,wallstreetbets,But he’s not so who really cares about his opinion
2021-04-13 15:17:12,wallstreetbets,Kevin is a shark but his motives are likely to indirectly promote his new b c project to the ”Reddit investors”z
2021-04-13 15:17:31,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah my friends we aren’t going to the moon we are going to mfering Star Wars galaxy
2021-04-13 15:18:08,wallstreetbets,Oh Kevin...don’t give those apes false hope..
2021-04-13 15:19:04,wallstreetbets,The Netflix comp is so weak lol
2021-04-13 15:19:18,wallstreetbets,That dudes smile was creeping me out.
2021-04-13 15:19:57,wallstreetbets,"I'm offended he lumped ""the Reddit crowd"" in with ""the Robinhood crowd"""

2021-04-13 15:20:31,wallstreetbets,"""and I'm not short"" is all you need to hear out of that interview."
2021-04-13 15:21:34,wallstreetbets,When did this happen
2021-04-13 15:23:01,wallstreetbets,I’m a long term holder of GME going forward!
2021-04-13 15:23:11,wallstreetbets,"Good! I like confirmation bias!

HOLD!"
2021-04-13 15:23:13,wallstreetbets,This is some wonderful confirmation bias

2021-04-13 15:24:00,wallstreetbets,He must have a wrinkled brain
2021-04-13 15:24:06,wallstreetbets,It's a sign we're making the right move
2021-04-13 15:24:37,wallstreetbets,the cynic in me though thinks that he believes he is underwater and is looking to put out press to make the stock go up so he can sell what he thinks are bags and get off the rocket ship
2021-04-13 15:24:55,wallstreetbets,"If I was short that stock right now, gruuuuu, brrre, mrrrrr, ahaaaaraha, kiiiii"
2021-04-13 15:26:01,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't the same people who shorted it at $20 try to short it at $200 or $300 and would have made a fortune by now?
2021-04-13 15:26:11,wallstreetbets,Completely agree with Kevin. That's $1 billion IPO is gonna be used to jumpstart the company I to e-commerce and other plans Ryan has in his mind. Bad for short term since price go down due to more supply in the market but long-term it's a good buy because assuming GME uses the IPO funds to remake the company I have high hopes
2021-04-13 15:26:30,wallstreetbets,"I like how this dude thinks, “the upside is limitless”."
2021-04-13 15:26:50,wallstreetbets,That guy is a major sellout.
2021-04-13 15:27:50,wallstreetbets,"If shark tank dude is in, I’m in"
2021-04-13 15:27:57,wallstreetbets,O'Leary confirmed: he's invested long hahahaha
2021-04-13 15:28:07,wallstreetbets,Fuck Kevin O’Leary. Dude is a fraud.
2021-04-13 15:28:20,wallstreetbets,So you could say it has *deep fucking value*
2021-04-13 15:28:50,wallstreetbets,Interesting... 🤨 where is the HF confidence and media FUD... it doesn’t work anymore... as we see the light at the end of the tunnel they see the dark under the edge of the cliff!! 🚀

2021-04-13 15:40:04,wallstreetbets,Looks like Kevin met Kevin
2021-04-13 15:40:24,wallstreetbets,What if... crazy idea... he’s just saying this so the retards buy a ton and then the people paying him to say it sell all their GME?
2021-04-13 15:41:07,wallstreetbets,Kev is a major douche.
2021-04-13 15:41:14,wallstreetbets,The limit does not exist.
2021-04-13 15:41:42,wallstreetbets,Don’t believe anything this guy says
2021-04-13 15:43:09,wallstreetbets,"When I'm rich, I'm gonna hire college students to follow these guys around, playing their own bullshit back to them whenever they self-contradict. I'm a fucking idiot and I know the market is unpredictable. These guys are meant to be at the height of their fields and consistently make absolute statements about the market with zero fucks given. I can only assume it's a side effect of being largely poor-proof."
2021-04-13 15:45:34,wallstreetbets,None of this is right. He’s saying IF this and IF that. He’s prob short.
2021-04-13 15:46:45,wallstreetbets,"he caught himself cheesing a minute in and tired to control himself, thats funny."

I'm still supposed to, right? I dunno wtf I'm doing. Diamond hands. right?"
2021-04-13 15:51:34,wallstreetbets,"i HATE shark tank. Those fuckers sit on their giant piles of money and do NO work, steal other peoples’ good ideas and make money off simply doing NOTHING.   
  
Having wealth should not make it so you can literally be immortal."
2021-04-13 15:52:49,wallstreetbets,"He isn't even talking about the short squeeze, just the fundamentals of the business and the brand."

2021-04-13 16:31:06,wallstreetbets,I recommend watching the entire interview! This was genuinely a great interview.
2021-04-13 16:32:25,wallstreetbets,"Left side: smiling, laughing, nodding

Right side: poker-robot face, no emotions, whatsoever"
2021-04-13 16:32:33,wallstreetbets,It looks like Kevin has eaten chocolate
2021-04-13 16:33:07,wallstreetbets,now that’s what i call a WEIRD BEARD
2021-04-13 16:33:39,wallstreetbets,"""I'll give you all my expertise and leadership, in exchange for 12.9% ownership stake in the company. And that's my final offer...."" - if RC was on Shark Tank."
2021-04-13 16:34:10,wallstreetbets,I like his answer.
2021-04-13 16:34:55,wallstreetbets,What ip
2021-04-13 16:35:03,wallstreetbets,A salesman is trying to sell me stock?   Time to get out.   Look at him salivating.
2021-04-13 16:35:50,wallstreetbets,So time to finally get out of GME
2021-04-13 16:35:55,wallstreetbets,TLDR; buy GME cause hedges r **fuk**
2021-04-13 16:37:02,wallstreetbets,That's baiting if I've ever heard it.
2021-04-13 16:42:02,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, Mr. Wonderful! Very cool!"
2021-04-13 16:42:02,wallstreetbets,"on Etrade, GME went from sell to buy to hold to sell to 'in play' in like two weeks"
2021-04-13 16:42:03,wallstreetbets,"Please! I just need to sell the shares at $100,000 per so I can buy something at GameStop for the first time! My parents too poor as a young boy not from Bulgaria."
2021-04-13 16:42:07,wallstreetbets,“The democratization of stock trading” YAAAAAAAS KING.
2021-04-13 16:42:51,wallstreetbets,Lol he has calls. Kids these days....
2021-04-13 16:43:33,wallstreetbets,Netflix will start a gaming streaming service and physical copies of games will become extinct.
2021-04-13 16:43:37,wallstreetbets,moooooon🚀
2021-04-13 16:43:48,wallstreetbets,can anyone tell me when this happened and where is it from?
2021-04-13 16:44:52,wallstreetbets,Mr. Wonderful!
2021-04-13 16:45:00,wallstreetbets,If Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary had a baby it would look alot like Ryan Cohen

2021-04-13 16:50:45,wallstreetbets,"He's trying his best to hide a HUGE smile
Apes to the moon!!! 🚀"
2021-04-13 16:51:41,wallstreetbets,Kevin O’Leary comes off as such a gay bear on shark tank. The fact that he is bullish on GME makes me even more confident.
2021-04-13 16:51:46,wallstreetbets,I thought Timothy Leary was dead...?
2021-04-13 16:52:36,wallstreetbets,"This makes so much sense!  Kevin, a no nonsense sensor of common sense and sensible company values, sensible or senseless moves, as stated from a most sensible person who makes sense.  (Sense of humor; optional.)"
2021-04-13 16:53:13,wallstreetbets,"oooohhhh aaaahhhhhhh

so he is now caught up with us?"
2021-04-13 16:54:17,wallstreetbets,Kevin doesn’t even watch the markets. He hears outdated chatter and regurgitates it.
2021-04-13 16:54:24,wallstreetbets,Kevin O’Leary is a real piece of shit.
2021-04-13 16:54:32,wallstreetbets,My favorite shark
2021-04-13 16:55:18,wallstreetbets,"I want to act like I know what they’re talking, but, I have no fucking clue. Just tryin to make a small amount of cash lol"
2021-04-13 16:56:26,wallstreetbets,I hate this dudes facial expressions...
2021-04-13 16:56:50,wallstreetbets,"
Sean Murray, is that you?"
2021-04-13 17:01:26,wallstreetbets,Why does meet Kevin look so fucking fake every time I see him?
2021-04-13 17:01:27,wallstreetbets,Wtf happened to Meet Kevin? I stop watching for 6 months and now that beard? No hate. Just didn’t see that coming lol
2021-04-13 17:01:33,wallstreetbets,GameStop should turn into the GameRoom of he 2020s. Hundred square feet of VR and AR gaming for you and your friends to hangout together while they figure out how to make that shit home ready and affordable
2021-04-13 17:01:49,wallstreetbets,Famous shitty investor with royalty fetish can speak words.

2021-04-13 17:10:08,wallstreetbets,"I've got a limit order for 20 shares at $120.25, thinking it bounce from there like it did a few weeks ago."
2021-04-13 17:11:07,wallstreetbets,As my local store closes....
2021-04-13 17:11:37,wallstreetbets,Does anybody know what DFV is gonna do on Friday.  Is he going to exercise?
2021-04-13 17:11:59,wallstreetbets,"I paperhanded out, but now I'm back in 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-13 17:12:04,wallstreetbets,It’s about to rip
2021-04-13 17:14:15,wallstreetbets,"This guy is long as a mf hahaha, 
Jk jk he fuckin gets it tho."
2021-04-13 17:14:32,wallstreetbets,It can go up 50% easily.  I may get some.
2021-04-13 17:14:35,wallstreetbets,Anyone have the source?
2021-04-13 17:14:55,wallstreetbets,I think the floor keeps getting higher. That ceiling I can’t even see it anymore 🚀🚀🚀💎💎🙌🏼🦍
2021-04-13 17:15:14,wallstreetbets,Ask Kevin about killing a couple of people a few summers ago while boating and drinking after dark. Put his wife at the wheel after accident
2021-04-13 17:15:40,wallstreetbets,"“The Upside of this [$GME] Is limitless” 

My tits are so Jacked ATM. 

This is solid DD from the one and only Kevin O’Leary it’s all the confirmation bias I need."
2021-04-13 17:16:14,wallstreetbets,So did he buy any GME?
2021-04-13 17:16:59,wallstreetbets,Now do AMC!!
2021-04-13 17:17:32,wallstreetbets,Without squeeze it can go up to $1000 imo. I believe it and thats why I'm holding this stock since Jan.
2021-04-13 17:17:42,wallstreetbets,“The upside is limitless.” Music to my ears.
2021-04-13 17:17:58,wallstreetbets,"He said he's not short! Does that mean he is in? 

Interesting"
2021-04-13 17:19:06,wallstreetbets,The pompous a$$.
2021-04-13 17:19:44,wallstreetbets,The guy on the left is smiling into my soul
2021-04-13 17:21:07,wallstreetbets,I hate that duchebag youtuber.
2021-04-13 17:21:26,wallstreetbets,"@ techno\_majesty, Listen remember when Kevin O Leary's wife killed somebody by accident? Seriously, she serves ZERO jailtime and bought their way with money and you still listen to this bozo? Unbelievable sorry..."
2021-04-13 17:21:35,wallstreetbets,Ape 🦍 stronger together 🤝
2021-04-13 17:21:45,wallstreetbets,Gotta love mr wonderful.

2021-04-13 17:25:14,wallstreetbets,"There was already a 2nd kick, so in a way he was 100% correct."
2021-04-13 17:26:32,wallstreetbets,So did he say shorts r fuk?
2021-04-13 17:33:31,wallstreetbets,It's so fucking pathtic that this is still going on months after the short lol
2021-04-13 17:33:45,wallstreetbets,The host's facial expressions and mannerisms bother me
2021-04-13 17:34:23,wallstreetbets,"He's a smart guy, knows which side to play. Now the apes need to pay him a royalty or he will squash you like a bug."
2021-04-13 17:36:25,wallstreetbets,Why does he have such an animated face. Looks CGI
2021-04-13 17:40:19,wallstreetbets,It’s so cool to think that the generation that grew/spent early adulthood up watching Shark Tank are revisiting these figures like Kevin O’Leary and Mark Cuban in this new but rated context of making money on a good and/or risky financial bet.
2021-04-13 17:45:53,wallstreetbets,"Used pc parts, I'm telling ya if Gamestop started selling and buying in used parts at their locations nationwide they may very well thrive"
2021-04-13 17:47:54,wallstreetbets,Eeeeeee deposit comes through tommorrow....
2021-04-13 17:50:42,wallstreetbets,"The sun burst forth from behind the clouds while I was watching this, it's a sign!"
2021-04-13 17:54:26,wallstreetbets,Lol 1000? That's low...to the fucking moon my fellow apes 💎✋🦍🚀
2021-04-13 17:55:40,wallstreetbets,Interviewer sounds retarded. Must be one of us.

2021-04-13 17:55:53,wallstreetbets,TITS FUCKIN JAAAAACKED
2021-04-13 17:56:51,wallstreetbets,I like the stock
2021-04-13 17:57:09,wallstreetbets,"In all honesty, we saw GameStop adding graphic cards not too long ago, what if they go full blown build-your-own Gaming PC and you can go and pick all the parts and have it built right there wouldn’t that be sweet?"
2021-04-13 17:57:36,wallstreetbets,Can I please just... rub your bald spot... just one time Kevin... ples.... pet ape.... nice ape...
2021-04-13 18:01:17,wallstreetbets,"Love all the sharks ,"
2021-04-13 18:02:01,wallstreetbets,Kevin O'Leary can eat a giant bag of dicks - Canada
2021-04-13 18:06:44,wallstreetbets,Every time the interviewer nods and smiles I want to punch him
2021-04-13 18:06:53,wallstreetbets,Going to zero? Who the shit is this goober?
2021-04-13 18:06:58,wallstreetbets,If he’s long then I’m long 🚀🚀🚀💎🙌🏼
2021-04-13 18:07:36,wallstreetbets,If each store was just given 50k a year for prize money tournaments......
2021-04-13 18:07:41,wallstreetbets,The young guy already has like 30 million dollars he’ll probably overtake Kevin O’Leary net worth overtime
2021-04-13 18:08:57,wallstreetbets,These shark tank sharks love to fuck the little guy
2021-04-13 18:09:35,wallstreetbets,thes fuckin monky's and there crotch rockets held onto with diamond hands.. they have no fuckin sense.. I love it. fuck Wall Street..Fuck the players in suits and power to the gamers that care about papa gamestop
2021-04-13 18:10:15,wallstreetbets,So buy more GME? I just really like the stock
2021-04-13 18:10:42,wallstreetbets,Kevin OLeary and his wife killed someone while they were fucked up boating in Ontario two summers ago. He's done a good job covering that up I have to admit.
2021-04-13 18:10:51,wallstreetbets,Kevin o Money
2021-04-13 18:12:07,wallstreetbets,Spoken as a true chevalier du tastevin.
2021-04-13 18:12:41,wallstreetbets,I didn't hear no bell!
2021-04-13 18:13:30,wallstreetbets,Dude on the left looks like Nick Cages hairy brother
2021-04-13 18:13:54,wallstreetbets,"Nobody should be trying to promote Meet Kevin imo. He allegedly knows Vlad, he was ripping DFV before/during the congressional hearing, and he seems to be pushing robinhood/Webull pretty hard."
2021-04-13 18:14:16,wallstreetbets,"Mr. Wonderful, this is a Wendy’s..."
2021-04-13 18:14:46,wallstreetbets,The guy on the left smiles in a way that makes me uncomfortable. I’ll ease my nerves by picking up a few more GME
2021-04-13 18:15:29,wallstreetbets,Is that my boy Kevin?!?!
2021-04-13 18:15:38,wallstreetbets,"GME could

1. Start their own version of GeekSquad to service IT/tech needs for all the people working from home now

2. Create their own version of Steam

3. Create their own version of an investment crash course online. ""You want to go to moon, you'll need more than a PS5, for $399 you can invest in yourself""."
2021-04-13 18:20:15,wallstreetbets,Is that a shark tank background
2021-04-13 18:20:42,wallstreetbets,Bullish!!
2021-04-13 18:22:36,wallstreetbets,I mean he’s a consistently failing businessman himself. It’s like taking casino management advice from trump.
2021-04-13 18:29:58,wallstreetbets,One of us!
2021-04-13 18:30:24,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-13 18:37:02,wallstreetbets,I have a feeling GME could have doubled their earnings if they'd just leaned on selling Gamestop merchandise.
2021-04-13 18:37:55,wallstreetbets,"I don’t love Kevin O’Leary as a guy, but when explaining the stock market he’s like a wise master teaching you about the secrets of life."
2021-04-13 18:42:00,wallstreetbets,"When DFV exercises the shares on the 16th, will the price dip on that action alone?"
2021-04-13 18:43:00,wallstreetbets,"Idk my opinion is that GameStop over the last 5-10 years as a brand has been such generic sterilized gamer crap. Never anything interesting or unique, just the same 12 funko pops next to their games"
2021-04-13 18:44:43,wallstreetbets,Why does this look like a deepfake?
2021-04-13 18:45:18,wallstreetbets,I love those two blue balls above Kevin’s head for nearly the entire interview.
2021-04-13 18:49:11,wallstreetbets,NOT A FAN OF MEETKEVIN
2021-04-13 18:51:46,wallstreetbets,Kevin needs to spend more time learning how to drive a boat without killing people.
2021-04-13 18:57:39,wallstreetbets,Check out XL fleet a lot of people online trying to squeeze this shorts covering and over borrowed.
2021-04-13 18:59:40,wallstreetbets,Both those guys are gigantic dingleberries
2021-04-13 19:00:52,wallstreetbets,Ball tugger!
2021-04-13 19:02:29,wallstreetbets,mr. wonderful is now mr. commercials.
2021-04-13 19:02:30,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-13 19:04:10,wallstreetbets,"COVID = everyone online, so they saw GME
 

Now that they’re aware of GME, once

nvm"
2021-04-13 19:11:30,wallstreetbets,Is this Live from today?
2021-04-13 19:14:49,wallstreetbets,Just curious how long ago was this?
2021-04-13 19:17:03,wallstreetbets,Now I want a short... That's actually how they market shorts
2021-04-13 19:18:20,wallstreetbets,Honestly for a second thought that was fat mac.

2021-04-13 19:31:49,wallstreetbets,guy on the left looks AI generated for the duration of this interview
2021-04-13 19:31:53,wallstreetbets,Never forget that O'Leary wouldn't back a charity on DD cause he couldn't make money off of it.
2021-04-13 19:31:55,wallstreetbets,I love Kevin o Leary
2021-04-13 19:33:49,wallstreetbets,Kevin is a tard and hasn’t had any success since he sold his company
2021-04-13 19:39:15,wallstreetbets,"And that's exactly why the stock doesn't tend to move around a bit more cheesy than dark like the rest.

I actually remember this game and was so happily surprised to see all the passive aggressiveness as they humble brag and compete over who loves the artist they’re portrayed as in the movies"
2021-04-13 19:44:27,wallstreetbets,"Good try, Ben Affleck. We can tell it’s you."
2021-04-13 19:45:22,wallstreetbets,Blessed Kevin
2021-04-13 19:47:05,wallstreetbets,Both Kevins are awesome!
2021-04-13 19:49:44,wallstreetbets,The interviewer seems very giddy.
2021-04-13 19:50:11,wallstreetbets,I almost accidentally bought a bottle of O'Leary wine last week but phew! I realized it was his and would profit that asshole if I did so I backed the fuck off and spent my $15 on a different bottle of vino.
2021-04-13 19:53:44,wallstreetbets,Lets go!
2021-04-13 19:57:46,wallstreetbets,"Not related to stock but game stop needs some plan to become profitable 

Esports,  something ?"
2021-04-13 15:35:39,wallstreetbets,Oh my goooooood the meme is dead
2021-04-13 19:34:47,wallstreetbets,"What a horrible comparison of Netflix to GameStop, Netflix pioneered streaming tv and movies. GameStop is basically a dinosaur at this point selling physical disks. Maybe they can pivot to digital game sales... oh wait. Hmm maybe game streaming... oh shucks."
2021-04-13 17:54:43,wallstreetbets,This sub is on some next level copium lmfao
2021-04-13 18:17:44,wallstreetbets,"You guys know O'Leary is a shitty businessman, right? Look into his history. The guy is a hack."
2021-04-13 18:36:51,wallstreetbets,"Kevin made no good points to justify his point.  He has no idea what Gamestop is and what Gamestops competitors do already OR how the consoles have ALREADY digitized the games.  Neither of these two made real points about the stock.  ""If you're short youre hurting""? How is that so?  We closed at 140 today with nothing but the downside in sight.  107 is the closest next support.  You'd be stupid NOT to be short right now."
2021-04-13 19:01:50,wallstreetbets,"I think they can be successful. However, Microsoft already has a successful Netflix like service in place (Gamepass). I imagine Sony will try to put something similar in place (they are already moving slowly in that direction). Gamestop is going to need to offer something unique, with value. I just don't know what that service is yet."
2021-04-13 19:22:00,wallstreetbets,"If you are valuing it on fundamentals and future business prospects, you'd be crazy to think it's not currently overvalued.  It's future plans amount to: develop new markets where bigger, better companies have already tried and failed, and enter into existing markets where entrenched incumbents have structural advantages that can't be overcome (barring some sort of miracle). That's it."
2021-04-13 14:46:51,wallstreetbets,I can’t stand how fake Kevin’s expressions look.
2021-04-13 17:06:19,wallstreetbets,So what happens when physical game media is dead? Next console cycle is gearing up to be the first all digital console cycle. Where does that leave gamestop? What's the long game here?
2021-04-13 17:21:14,wallstreetbets,"He uses Netflix as an analogy in his discussion. Maybe he should use Blockbuster, and you see what happened to that because it was not nimble enough in the marketplace."
2021-04-13 17:34:08,wallstreetbets,Gamestop should die but it won't die and now random shit is giving hope. I love watching you apes try and get economic freedom!
2021-04-13 17:42:27,wallstreetbets,"He’s seems verrry unsure of himself...pretty funny. No insight at all, this was a ridiculous interview. He seems to be looking down at some sort of notes as well. Probably paid well to say those things"
2021-04-13 17:46:04,wallstreetbets,Murderer.
2021-04-13 19:39:49,wallstreetbets,"oh please, he just wants all of you to buy start engine....  


He wouldnt touch that stock with a million foot pole"

2021-04-13 15:02:48,wallstreetbets,I hate The fake ass faces Kevin makes. Drives me crazy.
2021-04-13 15:10:44,wallstreetbets,"Damn, Makes me want to sell hearing that! I don’t trust a single one of them."
2021-04-13 16:56:28,wallstreetbets,"You know this is the exact kind of dude you DON'T want on your side, but whatever confirms your biases."
2021-04-13 17:45:11,wallstreetbets,Kevin should be in jail! 🖕🏻
2021-04-13 18:32:55,wallstreetbets,Kevin O’Leary is a Venture Capitalist he doesnt know shit about stocks lol
2021-04-13 15:48:21,wallstreetbets,"“I’ll give you $500,000 as a loan at first with 3% interest. Once you pay me back $325,000, the following $175,000 will be straight equity. However, I’d like a $1 royalty on each game sold until I reach my $500,000. I’m Mr. Wonderful! This deal is a no brainer. Oh, no deal.... you’re dead to me and someone is going to smash you like the tiny cockroaches that you are.”"

2021-04-13 17:39:41,wallstreetbets,"Jokes aside, my personal view of gamestop is forever ruined by them being absolute pieces of shit while I was aged 8-25, offering me 10 cents for games and selling them for $20. Running cooler, local shops out of business, and directly buying and shutting down EB games (and immediately raising their prices).

Their stock may or may not go up, but my hatred runs too deep to ever give them a penny."

2021-04-13 14:18:33,wallstreetbets,What does this mean!
2021-04-13 16:34:10,wallstreetbets,"The problem is Netflix pivoted to its own platform. GameStop can’t put its platform on any major console, the digital PC market is taken up by Steam, MS/Xbox, and Epic, And Amazon, Nvidia, Google and MS/Xbox are fighting over the streaming market."
2021-04-13 17:11:46,wallstreetbets,You think the stock is actually worth 100 plus per share? Serious question.
2021-04-13 16:43:09,wallstreetbets,"You just dropped, in a single sentence, the most compelling reason to buy GME I have seen in this sub.  Not joking."
2021-04-13 16:57:16,wallstreetbets,NFLX pivot is a great analogy!  Didn't really think of that.

It's good.

<*nod*>"
2021-04-13 15:38:55,wallstreetbets,"I think he’s careful not to go so far as to say it’s a good stock to own. He clearly stops short (heh, puns) at saying it’s simply a bad stock to short. 

But he’s definitely saying the company has truly valuable assets in its IP/brand and in its real estate ~~holdings~~leases. His rationale is that they can, in theory, leverage the visibility of the brand/IP to better utilize the real estate they ~~own~~lease in a new way that drives cash flow by opening up new streams of revenue. 

He says they can “hold classes” in their retail locations, which I don’t think makes much sense lol. But his point is basically that they aren’t beholden to using that real estate for retail locations. If they do what Netflix did, and move to a digital distribution model for game sales, rather than a brick and mortar retail model, then they can utilize those spaces for something *else* to drive revenue. 

Any retarded ape can come up with their own ideas for what those retail locations can be used for. The thing that’s left out of the video is that GameStop now has new leadership coming in who realizes the value of their real estate (it’s pretty obvious that 1700 locations with 1,200 sq ft per location is valuable (edit: because those *leased* spaces can be used for all sorts of business models, not just retail video game sales)...), who understands the value of digital distribution platforms and knows how to operationalize one (Chewy is a gold standard company as far as e-commerce goes), and who likely won’t be afraid to turn GameStop’s current business model upside down (it clearly wasn’t working).  

So I think he’s right to say the current stock price doesn’t *really* matter. Of course, it does matter in certain respects, but ultimately the current share price isn’t an accurate reflection of where the company will be 6 months, or 1 year, or 5 years from now. There’s tons of potential, and that potential simply cannot be reflected by the current share price - it’s yet to be determined whether they can reach that new potential that’s opened up for them. 

Honestly, the ripple effect emanating from the movement behind GME is just starting to be felt. People are starting to see what DFV essentially saw - a company with great assets being poorly run by shitty executives. The distraction of whether the shorts/hedgies are artificially deflating the price or whether retail investors are irrationally inflating the price has run its course by now, and that has allowed people to finally come to their own conclusions about whether there is actual value in GameStop as a corporation. And it seems like a lot of people are siding with DFV now that the dust has settled.

Edit: Clarified that GME doesn’t *own* real estate, which is an important enough distinction to warrant an edit, despite completely missing the point of why O’Leary sees value in those real estate leases."
2021-04-13 14:18:29,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. So, why are so many people on reddit, twitter, and the media so set on getting us  to sell a good long term stock?

Nuff said."
2021-04-13 16:01:39,wallstreetbets,This has been the case for a while now. Everything you see now is a function of hedge funds trying to delay the inevitable without triggering the nuke.
2021-04-13 17:24:53,wallstreetbets,"In short, he likes the stock."
2021-04-13 15:12:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but tbh one thing is that GME is not a 10 or 20 or even 50$ stock but to think that its real value could reach 300/500 or even more $ the share it might be overoptimistic.

And I say this having invested on GME, I want them to do well and make some money but ATM nobody is sure about wether or not the current 140$ share price is (and how much) inflated.

Then again, for sure short investors should be worried since probably they shorted GME to bellow 10$ and it probably is never going to be that low"
2021-04-13 14:30:23,wallstreetbets,It's a good stock to own at 20 USD - not at the current price.
2021-04-13 17:28:12,wallstreetbets,">He's saying that long-term, this is a good stock to own and that the short thesis of driving this down to $0 is absolutely off the table.

I definitely get that I wouldn't want to be short right now since the value is so hectic. 

Can you walk me through the logic of how this stock is good to own long term at 30x the value that it was last year though? A new board and a new CEO usually don't account for anywhere near that kind of bump. 

It still feels like kind of a dying industry when it is so easy for the game companies themselves to cut out the middle men."
2021-04-13 16:32:24,wallstreetbets,"Idk, I feel like most people in the US already know GameStop and yet it was about to go bankrupt. What does the IP matter if leadership refuses to improve their business model?

GameStop is known as the place people used to go to if they wanted to get ripped off on buying / selling used games and is now known as a toy store. And we all know what happens to toy stores 💀"

2021-04-13 18:18:38,wallstreetbets,I literally had to cover his face with my thumb lmao. Wtf dude
2021-04-13 17:46:03,wallstreetbets,He looked like he owned loads of GME and couldn't stop his face doing stuff when his bias was being confirmed (👁 ͜ʖ👁)
2021-04-13 18:46:01,wallstreetbets,Glad I noticed too
2021-04-13 18:32:45,wallstreetbets,"He's a creep, I can't stand watching him."
2021-04-13 17:11:15,wallstreetbets,He’s Meet Kevin and he makes 3-4 YouTube videos a day and has a lair that would make any of us cream. But he spends most of his day staring at a screen.
2021-04-13 15:44:27,wallstreetbets,"I’d be willing to bet he isn’t, and that he won’t invest until they prove they can do what Netflix did and move to a digital distribution platform. The guy got his start selling software, he’s very anti-brick and mortar retail. It’s expensive and unnecessary overhead in his mind. 

He’s a very shrewd investor. He wants almost guaranteed bets. And right now, GME still has a very unforeseeable future. He clearly sees enough value to be confident it won’t go bankrupt, but I don’t think he’s confident enough yet to give his money to them."
2021-04-13 16:05:59,wallstreetbets,He is... in one interview he said he has 10k invested or something like that.
2021-04-13 16:31:26,wallstreetbets,You wouldn’t be seeking investment capital after receiving all those delicious tendies—they’d be seeking you
2021-04-13 17:37:09,wallstreetbets,Is Kevin a good finance youtuber?
2021-04-13 18:30:40,wallstreetbets,"Think he just trained himself to alway be smiling when doing interviews and it just looks a bit forced and awkward when he does it. A lot of people get stuff like that drilled into them when learning how to do stuff like interviewing and whatnot. Though I think that's generally bad advice. Just don't look disinterested and be emotive and smile if it's appropriate, but mostly, just look natural."
2021-04-13 14:52:50,wallstreetbets,"Lol this is how the uninformed willingly deceive themselves. 

Did you not already know that literally every single stock has an unlimited upside, while having a limited downside? 

That is the sentiment he is actually alluding to, shorting is incredibly risky due to the unlimited downside."
2021-04-13 14:18:34,wallstreetbets,"Meh I'm probably not as smart as him, but the writing is on the wall that GME will die. We are all getting super computers with fiber at home and consoles that digitally buy games. The next generation of consoles will likely not have ANY physical cartridges or CDs. Solid state storage is getting cheaper by the day. And why would GameStop want to be a Microcenter like store? Nobody goes to Best Buy to go part out a PC rig, they won't do it at GameStop either. It's just way better to sit at home and compare Amazon, Newegg, and 10 others for the best deal than to rely on the stock of one brick and mortar store that you have to drive to that needs to pay the stocker and trucker salaries. Will GameStop becomes some Mecca of game tournaments and hangouts? Doubtful because if we all have good home PCs and fiber, there's no point to paying an hourly rate to be out of your house. I don't see any long term viability. Care to disagree?"
2021-04-13 16:05:24,wallstreetbets,"On one hand, you're right.

On the other, I REALLY don't want a large corp running LGS's out of business, and hope they never do it.

Wait, why are you buying your cards at Walmart/Target?  Find a local game shop, the prices are always far better anyway.  When I played MtG I was getting packs at 75-80% Walmart/Target prices."
2021-04-13 14:41:28,wallstreetbets,Something we clearly don't have...intellectual property. He is referring to the brand name in this situation.
2021-04-13 15:54:57,wallstreetbets,Yeah people are reading way too hard into this. He said the company could have a second kick. He didn’t say if he thinks that the stock price already has that value baked in. He didn’t say this shit is gonna explode to $1000/share...
2021-04-13 15:14:06,wallstreetbets,"He meant the actual underlying company, not just the stock price.

GME the company is still in transition from a dumpster fire to a real company.  Thinks look good, but it hasn't really become anything yet."
2021-04-13 17:12:10,wallstreetbets,He’s very intelligent just maybe a little bit on the spectrum
2021-04-13 14:39:56,wallstreetbets,Which one? Kevin or Kevin?

The general public already lost their asses and the WSBs crowd are just going to be averaging down back to 0.00 unfortunately. You can't listen to anyone in the media, especially somebody like Kevin O'leary with ties to CNBC and Wall Street.

2021-04-13 16:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Only point of his I think is weak is comparing it to Neflix. Netflix has done so well because they were one of the first in. GameStop would have some huge competition if they tried to make their own platform like that, most notably steam. Plus the issue of getting partnerships with Sony/Nintendo (I think they've got something with Microsoft already) to get this GameStop service on consoles. They've got an uphill battle but shorting GME is a stupid idea right now. I wanna snag 10 more shares and sell calls on it but even that worries me that I'll get assigned and boom, $500 again."

2021-04-13 15:15:59,wallstreetbets,"You are reading more into his statement than what he said. He said it would be bad to short the stock and that he hasn't.

2021-04-13 15:10:32,wallstreetbets,"Basically in the late 2000s,.Netflix I did a similar business shift as seen with what GameStop is doing. Also, GME has a very enthusiastic base, as seen with Tesla, due in part to g*mers™ and a cult of personality of RC and the stock."
2021-04-13 16:09:06,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-13 18:42:26,wallstreetbets,"Yes. E-commerce companies typically trade at a multiple of their sales. 

Net Sales for Chewy for fiscal 2020 was 2.4 billion; their current market cap is 36.29 billion. That's a 15x multiple.

Net Sales for GameStop for fiscal 2020 was 6.4 billion; their current market cap is 9.87 billion. That's a 1.5x multiple.

If we apply Chewy's multiplier to Gamestop, it should be trading at $1400/share."
2021-04-13 17:07:09,wallstreetbets,"Except really think about how they would sell a service. They aren't going to compete with Steam/Epic/GOG/etc on PC, Microsoft has Game Pass, and Sony has Playstation Now. 

So their only option is a service in the actual store, which doesn't seem likely to sell. Are they going to do tech repair? Well Best Buy has that market locked down with Geek Squad so you're starting from behind. Classes like Kevin mentioned? Doubtful. Who is going to go to gaming classes. Game nights? This one could work, but I dont see it being massively profitable and your local comic book shop or card shop probably is already better known in the local community for those things. 

I get wanting to think everything is sunshine and rainbows, but theyd need something genuinely revolutionary in the industry to carve out this section of the market."

2021-04-13 15:58:39,wallstreetbets,"> If they do what Netflix did, and move to a digital distribution model for game sales, rather than a brick and mortar retail model, then they can utilize those spaces for something else to drive revenue.

The problem with the comparison to reinventing themselves as the ""netflix of games"" is that this has been done already. Twice. First with Steam, nearly 20 years ago (yea Steam launched in 2003). And more recently with Xbox game pass. Both of these services offered something innovative. What is gamestops innovation going to be? I think it will be difficult to enter this market without giving customers a compelling reason to use it over competitors."

2021-04-13 14:39:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah brother, it’s fishy as hell."
2021-04-13 16:32:34,wallstreetbets,"because a stock being a good long term prospect does not mean any price is reasonable. I'm not saying what is and isn't reasonable. but I can look at a stock, believe that company is good long term, and also not believe it's a good buy at $300 a share relative to it's earnings, or even future earnings. there is a point where it's too expensive for even a good long term company. 

Google isn't going anywhere for example. It's a good long term buy. but it's not worth $10k a share today."
2021-04-13 15:11:02,wallstreetbets,Whether or not its a good long term stock doesn't change the importance of position. This is a stock that traded at $5 for years. If it levels out at $130 that is HUGE. People who were buying calls at $500 are going to have a bad time.
2021-04-13 16:53:29,wallstreetbets,"Because if you believe the fair market value of the stock to now be in the $150-250 range, it'd follow that your $350 cost basis is a failed endeavor.

That doesn't explain why they wouldn't have a prevailing sentiment of ""average down your position"".  

But it's not mutually exclusive to think ""retail investors made bad choices in January"" and ""Gamestop has a bright future""."
2021-04-13 15:51:32,wallstreetbets,"The rhetoric seems to have changed though. Now it’s being called a good long term stock which it might well be, but what happened to the moon? 

It was only a week or two ago that people were still swearing blind that these shares would be absolutely priceless very soon, within a matter of days, and you could sell them for $50k a pop.

Now the story has changed to a decent long term stock, which is way more realistic but let’s not pretend the claim wasn’t rockets to the moon."

2021-04-13 14:24:18,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. It's not about the brick and mortar stores. The whole upside is because of the HUGE amount of FREE marketing they've had WORLDWIDE.

They will pivot (which they've said) to different digital ways to do business and they have a pretty solid chance at success purely off the HUGE amount of FREE marketing they've had WORLDWIDE. Lol.

Or have some esports players giving lessons and coaching or having watch parties for large events.

Potential is there and they are already a recognized name in the arena"
2021-04-13 14:26:31,wallstreetbets,"i’d love to disagree, seeing how gamestop might be moving they could be the catalyst to solidify a sort of pc cafe scene in the US just like how Korea has its own scene, and although alot of people do play videogames in the comfort of their own home after close to a year and half of restricted social events, being able to play video games in one spot with all your friends is a good idea to cash out on. Not everyone can afford to make a pc, but people can affor 20-30 bucks for 6-8 hours at a pc cafe with their friends."
2021-04-13 15:03:15,wallstreetbets,"1. ""We are all getting super computers and fibre internet""... uhhh, what? maybe in like 20 years those things will be cheap enough to be ubiquitous, not anytime soon though 
2. ""No CDs or cartridges"". This is true. But their shift isn't focusing on physical games, hardware and peripherals are always going to be needed for gaming and entertainment. If they actually adapt, they won't be reliant on physical games
3. Buying from Amazon or NewEgg is better, maybe, it depends. I will try to get PC components or peripherals locally first. If building a full PC, then yes it is sometimes easier to order everything online, but I personally choose parts using PCpartpicker and then buy the components locally. That's just me tho and this is the most valid point against their long-term viability... BTW you don't have to drive there, they are apparently using doordash to do same day deliveries and normal shipping can also be done too
4. Mecca of tournaments and hangouts, it is possible. ESports are a massive growing industry and anything is possible there. As for hangouts, I used to love going to internet cafes in highschool to do LAN gaming with a bunch of friends. This is not the same experience as playing with them all from home, it is way better. Now if that will ever become popular/profitable, I don't really know. I don't think you can exclude that possibility though 
5. Stock price =/= value. Even if Gamestop fails sometime down the line, there are other factors (naked shorts/FTDs/newDTCrulings/UnitedAPES) that make what O'Leary is saying pretty logical

TLDR; who knows, but I like the stock. 

This is not financial advice. This is one retards opinion."

2021-04-13 17:25:19,wallstreetbets,"Similar? Haha... The companies are not even remotely comparable and that was almost 15 years ago now. That's a lifetime ago in this space.

GameStop still has *nothing* that is in any way revolutionary or industry leading whatsoever. Every potential play or ""pivot"" they could have right now is contingent on entering markets where they're already 10-20 years behind and full of established competitors that haven't just been sitting on their asses. A big part of their main revenue stream that originally got them as big as they are was the used game market where they ripped people off for years buying used games and reselling them for huge margins of profit while cutting developers out of the picture, which only sped up the direct to consumer digital sales landscape so that GameStop and their ilk could then be cut out of the loop themselves. Moving to more of an online focus will still have them be limited to physical sales of products for the vast majority of their revenue stream as they are not a developer, publisher or even a digital delivery storefront of any consequence.

Their best bet in the next few years is shutting down as many unprofitable B&M locations as they can and aiming to become a gaming focused Best Buy and NewEgg hybrid."

2. Consoles already sell ridiculous high priced accessories. What is changing is that brick and mortar can't get any cut of game sales once they go all digital.

3. People are increasingly just going to buy the product from wherever is cheapest online. Why pay more? GameStop is just going to be less efficient than someone like Amazon who has bigger warehouses and delivery trucks. They just can't compete at all in pricing for products.

Of course that company has a much broader scope and has their hand involved in a lot more than that but nonetheless. Bing failed to overthrow Google because people weren't using it. Why? I'm sure that's mostly subjective but I'd wager it was primarily due to poor aesthetics overall and lack of piquing interest. Like Google will usually update its logo to represent certain people and holidays, sometimes it turns into a game or a video, etc. Pretty sure Bing never had anything like that. A search engine is simple and 99% of average users can't tell a difference in performance or variance among accuracy/search results.

Tl;dr Bing failed to top Google due to a lack of creativity. Followings can always be divided, look at MySpace/Facebook for an example of that."

Definitely GameStop was cool when I was a teen cause I didn’t have a debit or credit card and I can take what ever money I had to go buy something fun for myself. Now that I’m older I have credit cards to buy online and find some deals. With the push of digital games, disc games are going to die down. The last four games I bought were all digital copies and I bought them while laying on my bed not needing to drive anywhere. This is me at my age and I love to game, and if GameStop is brilliant enough, they will find a way for me to hand over my money to them, if not, some other company can find a way and do it."

Plus, like the apple store, what you gonna do with your kids when you go to the mall, what other store gonna baby sit them? Hot Topic? 

I wouldn’t say B&M is gone yet and if some stores had shit I needed at decent prices I wouldn’t need Amazon. 

25-500$ for a goddamn hdmi cable, get bent, I’ll buy a pack of 10 for that and take my chances. Same with controllers, console repairs. I mean shoot, GameStop just needs to get into the monthly premium business, 10$ a month and every console cycle you’re guaranteed a console on release date instead of this bot shit. 

Being poor is expensive, but some parents can give a kid happiness for 10$ a month perpetual but not 599$ + 69$ up front. 

Then when they release a “pro” version mid cycle, it’s an easy upgrade route to the 10$ a month to just spend 2-3$ more to get that little bit of more juice plus a one time 30$ paperwork fee due at signing and turning in of the old console. They will even transfer your profile and games to the new one while you wait or call you when it’s ready. 

Console broke? If user damage, 50-100$ replacement, just died of old ass age, same day swaparronie.

Game disc scratched to hell? Bring it in for a replacement with proof of purchase within 1 year and get a lightly used copy free. Use the ole inkjet printer to slap a permanent label on the top of the game disk that basically says it’s a replacement so they can’t just roll into another GameStop and try to trade it in for $$ or full $$.

They rent every single store’s retail space and they’re eliminating them left and right. That’s what this has all been about, they are pivoting to e-commerce. Do you know what the e in e-commerce stands for?   
Do you have idea how expensive rent is and how much overhead they’re going to save by eliminating retail space? They don’t *need* to do anything with retail space, they don’t own it! They can simply not renew their lease when it’s up then boom, retail space isn’t their problem.  

Now, enough talking about “what are they doing to do with their retail space.”   
They’re moving it online with Ryan Cohen’s lead, the former co-owner of Chewy, the biggest e-commerce pet store in the world. He knows e-commerce.  

Any other dumbasses willing to announce their stupidity and lack of due diligence?  

Oh by the way, you want DD? Chewy’s market cap is ~6x their revenue, that’s what an e-commerce sites valuation looks like. When GME completes their pivot and ends up classified as an e-commerce site Wallstreet would valuate it similar to chewy, which means with GME’s revenue it’s stock price will be anywhere from $700-$1100. Who gives a flying fuck about “muh short squeeze.” If you’re long GME for the right reasons and not desperate for a short squeeze, you’re looking at a stock price that’s so far discounted you’d have to be a lunatic not to buy as much as possible."

I'm not sure you are as in tune with the consumer as you believe. You know why disc drives are preferable? You don't have to pay the price microsoft or sony put on games on their stores (which are robbery). You can buy physical copy for 25% of that cost and have the same content, and a physical disc you can then trade or sell, or give to a friend/sibling. that is value that digital can never match, not to mention a physical disc and case which some gamers prefer.

3.

4. As a sole business, 100% agree.. as a supplement or additional revenue stream, it could absolutely help profitability. You didn't mention ESports which is a massively growing industry.. people already pay to go watch that shit live

It makes much more sense that the hedge funds panicked at the end of January and threw their terminals out of the window, and have yet to get them set up agin, so have not been able to cover their positions. It is also clear that there was no squeeze in January, that was just normal trading, the squeeze is yet to come.

When I read what they want to do it was a “who give a shit if you can’t compete on prices?” which they can’t. And who wants to order something so they can drive to GameStop to pick it up in a few days instead of just ordering it to their house?


GameStop had the opportunity to innovate and move along with the industry in so many different ways and they just stuck with the same old bullshit from the 90’s and early 00’s before easy access to high speed Internet and then just continued along even as streaming continued to innovate further.


I could see them coming up with an online system like Steam/Epic and appealing to competitive gamers by having constant company sponsored tournaments, competitions, etc that could set them apart from current streaming platforms. Otherwise they better plan on figuring out how to undercut everyone."

This is an exaggeration. You shouldn't speculate money you're not willing to loose on a dramatically overvalued company like GME in hopes of a miraculous turn around or a possible short squeeze. If you invest into a diverse group of boring companies that are reasonably valued and have a history of making money, it's unlikely that you'll loose money in the long run. It's more likely that you'll loose ""money"" by keeping it as cash, because cash depreciates over time."

- Wanted to buy an extra Switch pro controller for a trip i was taking with friends.  My nearest gamestop ran out of controllers, so I went to the Target next door and bought it instead.

- I bought an external hard drive for my PS4 from Gamestop since I wanted one same-day.  After checking online, I realized I could've gotten a better product and cheaper from Amazon and Walmart.

My purchases since then have all been thru Amazon."
2021-04-13 18:32:45,wallstreetbets,"In another comment I wrote on this thread, I talked about how GameStop needs to come up with a better idea to keep its business going. Not talking about stock aspect but actual business aspects, in how they can get more customers to their business and spend money. I wouldn’t want people to lose jobs, but the mere not wanting people to lose jobs is not how a company keeps running. They have to come up with a strategy, contingency planning in case those strategies fail and other unplanned events occur, and basically adapt and have ingenuity to keep alive. You brought up Barnes and Noble which is basically where GameStop might be at in the business, if they keep the same course they will follow Barnes and Noble. I liked going into Barnes and Noble too and I definitely don’t want anyone losing jobs, but that’s how businesses go, if you can’t keep up and have a way for people to hand over there hard working dollars, it is going to fail. How Kevin said, they have the IP to their advantage and this new wave of fresh air thanks to Reddit to try get out alive and keep going, but staying the course is not the answer. Btw, I don’t own any of this stock. I would love for it to go up so those Wall Street heads hedge funders can really cry about it. But I’m just saying they have to come up with some business aspect and not rely on the stock doing the work, cause we all know stocks are fugazi"

I've been bullish on gme since January, squeeze or no squeeze, but I can't find any counter DD to the squeeze already happening. The squeeze would be more than a nice cherry on top, but there is no certainty that it will happen. 

Unless you can point to some data that shorts have been covered, you can't operate on the assumption that January was the squeeze."

2021-04-13 19:18:24,wallstreetbets,"I mean, Bloomberg terminal says institutions own 115% of the float. And when you add retail in, that’s a crap ton naked shares.  Considering anything over 20% is enough for a squeeze, and institutions owning enough for 15% of the naked shares, that’s pretty close.  Add in retail, and you you guessed it, we’re in squeeze territory.

You may say, there’s other stocks with more short than 20%! And you’d be right. But it takes a crap ton of money, and that money must be buying and holding to create a squeeze. Which is why GME works out so well. So its not only has it happened twice. Looks like there’s enough shorts, and plenty of holders to create a third. 

Again, this is a casino, so no one knows, but it’s obviously shorted, and obviously the apes aren’t going anywhere.  But y’all should really stop buying my $600 covered call weeklies.

2021-04-13 18:51:31,wallstreetbets,"You do know that the dtcc has passed new rule to margin calls. It hasn't been implemented yet. But when it does, it will make a demand for our supply of shares. The shorts have not covered their shorts and continue to just keep trading naked shorts and darkpool bullshit to manipulate the price so the can continue to short the stock and when margin finally gets called they have to deliver those shares. See, supply and demand. All the naked and fake share shorting is going to catch up with them. Not only will the shorts have to cover the real shares, they ha e to cover naked as well. There's so much more that they can do to keep afloat. And I am not a psychic,psycho lil bit I've been told, but I can always hope this will pan out. Chump change if not.

Even the dumbest hedge fund manager would have realized by now that Gamestop's share value isn't going to 0 any time soon and they'll lose more on the margin premiums in the near to medium term than they could possibly gain by waiting. Most of the current short positions could have been opened when the share price was $200 or even $300."

2021-04-13 18:01:21,wallstreetbets,"To provide some perspective from a long time store manager at GameStop, despite boneheaded company moves over the years, a fair majority of the stores remain profitable year over year. I started as a holiday hire in high school and stayed for a long time, spanning fifteen years. I managed four locations over the course of my time there and each one earned enough money to cover the cost of the individual store's payroll, product and utilities, in addition to generating profit for the corporation.

Things have been getting worse for years at GameStop, but overall the stores still make money and have a lot of loyal customers. Even though you can get your games online or at Walmart, the best stores had staff that were knowledgeable without being overbearing and easy to talk to. They were just fellow gamers who wanted to get excited about new stuff and geek out with you. There will always be a value to that, no matter how much of the industry moves digital only.

My point is that, try as they might, a lot of stores make money, at least enough to justify their extended existence and I don't personally see the company folding any time in the near future. I think we will continue to see certain aspects scaled back. If you've been in one recently, they cut a lot of the unnecessary shit and the overwhelming in your face marketing plastered across every spare inch of wall and shelf.

New leadership is good, but GameStop has had a lot of ""new leadership"" the past few years and they need a steady guiding hand as they develop a new identity or evolve into something else entirely."

2021-04-13 19:31:59,wallstreetbets,"If they truly, legitimately think gme will fall back to earth, then at no point did they close their short position. A small player or a small firm, sure, perhaps they got margin called. But a monstrous hedge fund/market maker is not going to allow margin to dictate its decision to close its short position. If they legitimately believe GameStop would fall back to earth, they would have a way to avoid getting caught in a squeeze, wait for it to fall, and then slowly unwind their short position.

We saw an initial rise almost purely due to options activity, and MMs having to hedge. At the same time we saw massive hedging, we saw massive institutional ownership, and global pressure. GME was the most traded stock in the world. So even if they did cover, how are they covering in competition with that much additional buying pressure. There is a reason they shut buying off for retail; it would have sent the shares into the thousands at the very least. 

Firms and Wall Street do not play fair. There is a reason why ‘08 happened. The fine for misreporting short interest is literally change to them. What’s in your pocket right now. Nothing? That’s what it costs them to lie. 

At the same time even if low priced short positions were closed, a ton of new short positions were undoubtedly opened at the higher prices. Funny enough, if you compare CHWY to GME, they had near identical books, and the same ceo/chair. Except chewy is worth 4 times what gme is worth today. Only difference? CHWY’s TAM is what, 1/4 of GME’s? 

I still believe old big institution shorts, if they firmly believe GME is worth squat, can significantly delay any forced squeeze, besides the actual owners recalling their shares."

I think they should rent out every location they own (tho most are leased I believe) to companies that are still stupid enough to want a physical location.

As long as 67M owners don't care about there shares loaned out/voting rights, then the other 67M can have lent shares that can't be loaned out and having voting rights."

2021-04-13 16:49:26,wallstreetbets,I think you misunderstand. They will call back lent out shares forcing shorts to cover. Look at what was just announced... debt buyback by GameStop allowing them to do a merger or issue a dividend so they may not have a choice but to call back lent out shares

2021-04-13 18:35:25,wallstreetbets,When do we receive a proxy card to vote? And when is the shareholder meeting?
2021-04-13 17:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Not quite.

Fidelity and blackrock are two huge institutional holders who have lent shares they own to short sellers. I should know, I borrowed 500 from fidelity.
Already spoke with them, nothing to worry about, they’re not recalling institutional shares.
Both refused last year when GameStop asked them to as they will again this year.

If you’re in a margin account and want to vote then they might recall those. But that’s it.

This will be just another big nothing.

Edit proof : https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/how-investing-giants-gave-away-voting-power-ahead-of-a-shareholder-fight-11591793863

GameStop Corp. shareholders vote this week to resolve a fight over the embattled videogame retailer’s board. But the company’s largest investors won’t cast much of a vote.

The three biggest money managers in GameStop reported that their funds held some 40% of shares in the first quarter. When it was time to commit to voting, they controlled roughly 5% of ballots, according to count estimates reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Each share of GameStop normally grants an investor one vote

That was in 2020"

2021-04-13 16:58:52,wallstreetbets,Yeah sorry I’m terrified of posting too much info. I put a picture in my profile of the full profit and loss
2021-04-13 17:26:04,wallstreetbets,"yeah i get the dev tools way, but i could fake any position. wondering why this one in particular had people suspicious and it turns out it's because of that particular brokerage's (webull) ui, which i wasn't familiar with.

op has since provided proof. our overlord /u/zjz had an interesting proposition to brokerages, where they should allow users to share their via a direct link a position that they wish to make public—like when you purchase something from amazon, for example. don't see it happening any time soon, but hopefully in the not too distant future"
2021-04-13 16:59:38,wallstreetbets,Added picture in my profile of profits and loss. Apologies for not putting it in the original
2021-04-13 14:27:22,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. I have tried to explain this to numerous people numerous times...they don't get it and don't want to get it. A company cannot recall it's shares, and the chaos that would ensue if they could would be disastrous. However, as stated in the op, brokers that have lent shares can recall those lent shares. GME can't force them to do they...they can only ask that they do it."

2021-04-13 17:45:01,wallstreetbets,"Keep in mind that they may not have a choice like with overstock. Take a look at the announcement that Gme is paying off all debt allowing them to do a merger or something like this which would in turn force the hand to call back shares. I.e. Cohen may not give them a choice, and can you blame him? They wanted to bury the company."
2021-04-13 17:45:30,wallstreetbets,"I keep seeing your name in GME FUD comments, never with proof"

Just know you can post pictures on anything and everything in webull expect your account number and the bank accounts. 

Noting will happen to you or the position. It is scary but learning is best when with experience!"
2021-04-13 17:31:45,wallstreetbets,Exposure of that brokerage through social media probably has nothing but upside for said brokerage.
2021-04-13 14:58:17,wallstreetbets,"You implied GME was doing it when you said ""GME is recalling shares"". That's not the same as ""GME is (really hoping that institutional investors start) recalling shares"". They have nothing to do with it other than kindly asking."
2021-04-13 17:50:06,wallstreetbets,"Sure if someone bought gamestop that might be a problem, but certainly that's not happening with their stock price at what its at right now, or if it did happen gamestop would agree to a double digit share price in the deal.

Zero chance. I don't even think you could convince an MA student gamestop was a good buy right now.

Next step I bet is share dilution, that's Cohen's best move to keep this thing going. But not so good for you guys :) 

Besides, from the looks of things, most short positions are in the 200+ range, anyone single digit was closed our during the 480 runup. They'll have plenty of chances to exit if there's a potential merger with only a 15% SI"
2021-04-13 18:14:40,wallstreetbets,No worries! Happy to help! What can I help you with proof of?

2021-04-13 17:25:46,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the insight!
2021-04-13 17:41:59,wallstreetbets,Agreed I really like this idea.
2021-04-13 18:02:17,wallstreetbets,"Si at 15% is fake. Look at the sec notice in 2013 about how short interest is hidden in the options market through married puts and deep itm calls. Then look at how many deep itm calls were bought over the past month. Now look at how many were bought this past week or so. Why are they not doing it anymore? Because of the dtc rule preventing it that was out in place 2 weeks ago. Now look at the other dtc rules coming out and you can start to see the bigger picture at work here. Your comment is missing the forest for the trees and it’s exactly what you are supposed to see, but if any of the so called MA’s dug any deeper they would see what I see 😉

Regardless we’ll see what happens in a few weeks! I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors! I may lose money but only time will tell!"
2021-04-13 18:15:27,wallstreetbets,"I did. 

The proof I mentioned isn't regarding last year, it's what you said of having talked to them and they won't recall institutional shares this year. If you have proof of that, not that it would change much though, please post on GME related subs. Counter DD and insights are welcomed if you frame it neutrally."
2021-04-13 18:16:30,wallstreetbets,"Not discounting this in the slightest. I believe it was more advantageous for them to continue to reap profits from lent out shares last year. I’m not sure that is the case this year though, and again the hand can be forced so they may not have a choice!"
2021-04-13 18:21:53,wallstreetbets,"I cant tape a phone conversation I had with my brokers risk desk, that's probably illegal. 

But from the sounds of it, you guys probably have one or two people long on GME who use Fidelity as their broker.

Here's a thought, call their risk desk, they're your broker after all.   
Ask them if they will be recalling institutional shares (shares fidelity owns in funds etc) and forcing closed their customers short positions."
2021-04-13 18:27:55,wallstreetbets,"They're not my broker and I'm not that interested in the answer

I only remark at how much energy and time you seem to spend on anti-GME narrative and it's always some sort of speculation without palpable proof, again confirmed this time

Anyway, cheers"

2021-04-13 19:18:24,wallstreetbets,"It's disconnected from fundamentals due to hype. Literally the opposite situation of when DFV bought it. 

Positive sentiment already made the price higher than neutral sentiment would.

If the squeeze isn't squoze is true, it might rise more, but nobody can promise that for sure. One hedge fund already blew up. It seems like it's over to me. I could be wrong though."

2021-04-13 19:51:57,wallstreetbets,"I did not have to read it all to see that you are smart, so allow me to challenge your singular focus on oil as a commodity versus oil as a precious commodity.

Do you know what happens when oil is reduced in price, but the end point sale price is increased? Yes, the profit margin is higher.

1. Moving oil is expensive, and environmental cleanup is more expensive. Reducing volume is a major cost saving that increases profit margin.
2. Pollution reduction is at the heart of ""climate change"" laws, so it is not simply about heat conductive gasses in the atmosphere. Reduced shipping volume also reduces potential incidents of environmental damage, which makes politicians happy.
3. Profit from oil at the end point of sale (for instance, at gas stations) benefits economies that do not profit from resource extraction from natural sources. This equates to profits sharing with the world proportional to usage.

The likely scenario for the future is that oil producers will become more like public utilities with their profits coming from profit sharing of value adding producers, like refiners of gasoline, plastics, cosmetics, petroleum jelly, and etcetera. Various deals or cross investments will establish this. Consequently, inflation tied to the broad use of oil is diminished almost entirely, since oil can reach rock bottom price without disturbing profitability of oil based products. Subsequently, governments benefit greatest from the increased tax options in the varied industries oil touches. Vehicle fuel can be allowed to inflate exorbitantly to encourage a shift to electric vehicles while still allowing oil energy plants to share the burden with coal as a low cost energy commodity until other energy sources take over.

Listen, high oil cost creates a potential for damage to economies during the transition between energy sources in addition to prohibiting expansion to businesses and jobs. Governments cannot allow high oil prices, because the will to maintain high value natural resources would cause oil to resist transition from pricing alone. Oil *must* be artificially reduced in price to facilitate political promises, so it will. There is no other way. Thus, the pragmatic investor would be wary of investment theories that rely on high oil prices.

I realize that many billions in individuals' wealth has been stuffed into traditional energy resources, but it is their choice to go down with the ship. To me, it is not a sign of future strength. To me, it is a sign of a dying past. Those investments will be lost when no new investors free their positions. It's just the way it is. Old people who cannot let go of the past.

I see the future, and run to it."

EDIT: my CPA said that since none of these gains were carried over the fiscal year, the losses are counted against the cost basis before capital gains taxes are calculated. He advised me to liquidate all of my day-traded positions in October/November if I could to retain my adjusted cost basis and only owe a percentage of the adj. gain in taxes.

2021-04-13 13:01:47,wallstreetbets,"This subreddit recently found out about wash sales and is tripping about them, most of the time for no reason.

All you really need to know is you should realize losses you want to realize in December, and do NOT re-buy the items sold at a loss for 30 days (in January, if that's easier).

What you want to avoid is a wash sale moving your loss from tax year 2021 to 2022. Not really something to worry about in April."
2021-04-13 12:54:18,wallstreetbets,"Same year cancels out as long as the losses are not on securities that are then purchased again within 30 days.

So, if you bought and then sold company X for a 1k loss. But then got back into company X within 30 days and it jumped significantly and sold for a 2k profit. You would not be at a capital gains of $0, it would be 2k. So, even though you actually only realized 1k, you would be taxed as though you realized 2k.

So it really become a problem if you are day trading the same securities all the time and taking both profits and losses on them. Theoretically you could make $0 in realized gains, but actually owe taxes on thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars."

2021-04-13 13:32:07,wallstreetbets,"Just spoke with my CPA and TDAmeritrade and they basically said I don't have to change my name and move to mexico.

You're correct, and I can tell how much bad information there is passed around here with people not understanding that the adjusted cost basis is an aggregated loss that is subtracted from any gains in the same year.

For the tards in the back: if you make +$50,000 on December 31st 2020, and then lose it all on January 1st 2021, you're going to have to cough up uncle sam's cut of the 50k for the 2020 taxes. Then you can either count the ""new"" loss against stock gambling gains that year, or count up to $3k against income taxes at the end of 2021.

2021-04-13 15:44:19,wallstreetbets,"So just to confirm, they said no need to worry about wash sales over quarterly payments, only for end of year, correct?"
2021-04-13 13:28:46,wallstreetbets,"Potentially. Basically if you make 100k on one position, but lose 90k on another you'd have 10k in taxable gains. If you made a wash sale that pushed that 90k loss to January you'd get taxed on 100k.

That 90k loss only gets rescheduled to next year so you don't *lose* it. But generally deferring taxes paid as long as legally possible is the best thing you can do. Those taxes on 90k worth of income could be invested and grow over a year so in that sense it is a financial loss.

It helps to look at wash sales as ""rescheduling loss"" versus ""cancelling loss"" if that makes sense. You don't want to reschedule a loss to a later tax year."
2021-04-13 17:01:20,wallstreetbets,"If the position is negative and you want to take the loss, basically yes. If it is positive you may or may not want to realize the gains."

But yeah you have the right idea.  There’s a bit more nuance to it and I’m not an expert by any means but that’s what I would plan on paying. 

Why not just pay the roughly $20k before April 15 and not worry about having a huge tax bill at the end of the year?"
2021-04-13 13:39:19,wallstreetbets,That's essentially what my CPA said. He said that I should just focus on reconciling everything at the end of the year to no current holdings and I should be fine just paying my dues on the $60k.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DKNG vs. PLTR - Why I like them both I am going to make this DD brief. DKNG and PLTR are considered two leaders in their categories. I hold positions in both but I like DKNG better because I think it will continue to grow as the TAM grows. Millenials are going to push this stock higher over the next decade.

What I love about DKNG:

* Insane Growth, Extremely healthy Gross Margins
* TAM is growing faster than ever- expected to increase to 45B in a few years
* Healthy cash balance
* Price to sales is decreasing drastically as a result of huge top line growth
* tons of opportunities for expansion
* Forward facing consumer company, with more than 30 states that could become available to DKNG. 
* Cathy loves it
* Guidance was increased to 5-7B from 3-5B

What I love about PLTR

* Insane gross margins of near 80%
* Moaty business with lots of contracts related to covid and the defense industry
* Tons of opportunities for expansion
* Potential opportunity for mammoth contracts that come out of nowhere.
* Cathy Loves it

What I don't like about PLTR

* PLTR leadership is known to be conservative- Biden is in the white house so maybe more controversy.
* Their Price to sales isn't decreasing as fast as DKNG
* Guidance was so so.

What I don't love about DKNG

* Not profitable yet but expected to be soon.
* I don't like the competition from fan duel as well as PENN
* Economy opening is bullish for sports gambling but bearish for online gambling
* Heavily regulated industry but showing approvals in multiple states

2021-04-13 12:37:19,wallstreetbets,"I fucking love DKNG, absolutely my favorite stock right now. Am longing 100 shares til $100 and have a call spread set up for the May 7 earnings. I love Donkey Kong."
2021-04-13 19:40:55,wallstreetbets,"No hate, I just want to dissprove your point about Biden-PLTR relationship. Biden and Kamala both have mentioned PLTR in the past and praised its work and the current Director of Intelligence is former PLTR employee."
2021-04-13 11:51:14,wallstreetbets,Buy
2021-04-13 11:35:00,wallstreetbets,I like them both too.

2021-04-13 13:38:06,wallstreetbets,PLTR CEO is a democratic socialist iirc not conservative. Though he has said he will work exclusively with US and its allies which may be interpreted as conservative? Other founders are more conservative.
2021-04-13 16:52:20,wallstreetbets,I have both LEEETTTTSSSS GOOOOOOOOOO
2021-04-13 12:22:00,wallstreetbets,"CATHY. Monkey see, monkey do"
2021-04-13 17:50:05,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you that DKNG is best in class. They made a really prudent decision early on to acquire all of their service providers so they’ll never get fucked by some contract that expires 5 years down the road. Can’t say the same about PENN. That being said, no one has ever been able to concisely explain to me exactly what PLTR does. Despite being very technically literate, it took me dozens of hours of research to understand their value. I know that puts me in the minority of the PLTR investor pool and I’m For that reason, I’m out."
2021-04-13 16:52:39,wallstreetbets,$PLTR is a total loser. Cut and run.

2021-04-13 19:19:03,wallstreetbets,"I took a small YOLO position of this this back in 2017 when it was $12 based on a Motley Fool article lmao. Still holding, happy about the gains. But I have no idea how you could get the timing right and dwarf my gains so quickly, congrats!"
2021-04-13 19:24:43,wallstreetbets,Now to buy puts
2021-04-13 19:28:29,wallstreetbets,I work in the industry. I'd suggest you sell ASAP because this pos is gonna tank.

2021-04-13 15:10:20,wallstreetbets,Can I ask why you’re hear if “biotech is > than meme stocks”? Like congrats bruv. You’re amazing. You came here to rub it in like some over privileged douche bag? Or because you give a fuck about other people in this forum? If ya let me borrow $5 I’d put my money on you being a douche.
2021-04-13 17:12:55,wallstreetbets,Which biotech stock did you buy
2021-04-13 11:25:05,wallstreetbets,$RGBP?
2021-04-13 14:08:50,wallstreetbets,At least warn me next time
2021-04-13 15:16:14,wallstreetbets,Would be nice you showed the actual investment as per unwritten rules of this sub. You can make this same pic by depositing $400k from your bank.
2021-04-13 17:26:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah ok you're just some casual millionaire already who pretends to have some relevancy with us peons.

2021-04-13 14:11:28,wallstreetbets,"I'm fairly new to stocks, and I'm still trying to learn about this more. Would someone be willing to explain to me how the 77 shares resulted in a profit of 442k? I don't understand option orders."
2021-04-13 14:21:10,wallstreetbets,What biotech? All mine are down like 8% every day
2021-04-13 15:36:08,wallstreetbets,"I need to know what stocks are these, so that I can start investing now in them and lose money."
2021-04-13 15:52:02,wallstreetbets,are we gonna ignore that this man is a millionaire on Robinhood?

2021-04-13 17:34:46,wallstreetbets,I grow more and more suspicious of these posts.
2021-04-13 18:50:04,wallstreetbets,"Imagine using robinhood, gf’s on the gains but gtfo of the hood"
2021-04-13 18:51:16,wallstreetbets,I wish I understood options trading. Jesus.
2021-04-13 18:51:38,wallstreetbets,"This seems like some fake nonsense. Almost 1M in robinhood buying power, yet only 4k invested, turns into 400k in one day. Color me skeptical"
2021-04-13 19:44:05,wallstreetbets,Soo what company was this ???
2021-04-13 14:23:44,wallstreetbets,"I'm soooo glad OP shared this to us after the catalyst has happened.

Soooooo dope of OP."

2021-04-13 12:58:50,wallstreetbets,"they're approval plays, and they generally just trade sideways during trials for years until *possibly* running up; delays and subsequent dumps aren't uncommon, although occasionally they'll run up on minor good news and you can sell for enough profit to rebuy without caring about it bleeding for months afterward

huge potential upside, but i don't recommend it to anyone who doesn't know the industry"
2021-04-13 13:49:00,wallstreetbets,"Same here. I always get burned because I read that some company has promising clinical trial results so I buy in, then the company issues a crap ton of new shares and dilutes me to pennies on the dollar. Now I just don't touch them."
2021-04-13 14:20:14,wallstreetbets,And great to see his 2020 tax forms are in good shape. I’m seeing two wins here

2021-04-13 13:48:47,wallstreetbets,"Same here, a lot of sell the FDA approval news happening. Decided to try KNSA this week. Seems bottomed out. We'll see how it goes."
2021-04-13 15:58:41,wallstreetbets,">I always lose on biotech

Ditto. I've been fucked by so many biotech stocks on the AIM. They always look promising, the share price dips for whatever reason and then get snapped up by a huge company. Every. Single. Time."
2021-04-13 16:16:47,wallstreetbets,I wonder if these are the ones he bought a year ago
2021-04-13 15:35:24,wallstreetbets,Why is it flat lining like that?
2021-04-13 17:29:09,wallstreetbets,Ape taxes
2021-04-13 14:41:24,wallstreetbets,He totally won’t be getting audited
2021-04-13 16:40:48,wallstreetbets,"I mean I buy $40c and $50c on SPACs 

When one blows up that doesn’t mean I’m doing some shady shit, just means I finally got lucky"
2021-04-13 19:42:17,wallstreetbets,20% OTM is low for biotech. They live and die by their results and as long as results are being announced and you're gonna play it you might as well go 20 to 40% OTM for the gains.
2021-04-13 13:37:03,wallstreetbets,"I was taking a look at this earlier and thought, wow, I wonder how many lucky bastards purchased those 10000% gain options.

2021-04-13 12:38:00,wallstreetbets,Thought the same...
2021-04-13 14:24:50,wallstreetbets,no dd insider trading. Only reason they would buy calls that expire this week.

2021-04-13 11:35:04,wallstreetbets,Based on TA and FA expecting a bounce to 150.  They kept mentioning they’d share data at an “upcoming conference” and announced 26 presentations at AACR this week.  I figured they’d release and the stock would exit oversold territory to jump 15%.  This was better.
2021-04-13 13:45:53,wallstreetbets,Because it's not GME
2021-04-13 18:26:02,wallstreetbets,Because we don’t upvote insider trading. It’s too easy.

2021-04-13 14:26:36,wallstreetbets,Culd hv shared us the DD. Tht wld hv been a lot better
2021-04-13 15:13:17,wallstreetbets,"Sad fucking state of this sub these days. WSB is a shadow of what it was like 18 months ago. There was simply way more to talk about. 

Where my homies that remember MSFT 3/20 200C? How about the great wsbgod with his puts on cruise lines. Fucking beautiful."
2021-04-13 19:46:08,wallstreetbets,Because its suspected inside trading
2021-04-13 15:50:47,wallstreetbets,No. Because he called out meme stocks instead of focusing on celebrating his gains. He basically saying fuck your meme stocks so meme stock holders say fuck you right back. Pretty basic stuff
2021-04-13 11:32:00,wallstreetbets,How can she slap?

2021-04-13 15:11:58,wallstreetbets,An MM will always be there to buy an itm contract for a few penny discount. Always.

2021-04-13 11:52:54,wallstreetbets,Just went through your post history.  You have been riding this for a while and trying to alert people.  Nice fucking job!  I do wish quality posts like these would get more attention around here.  Oh yeah and fuck you.
2021-04-13 11:44:56,wallstreetbets,"I don’t disagree with you, the new content is so watered down with all memes. I’m surprised that your post even got approved but sick gains nonetheless."
2021-04-13 11:36:38,wallstreetbets,"You alerted WSB literally over a year ago. Great job. And a great argument for not posting, the sub sucks because it's filled with meme stocks yet you don't even bother posting non-meme stocks to make the sub better. Be the change you want to see in the world!"
2021-04-13 12:04:05,wallstreetbets,I would have read it 😞
2021-04-13 12:11:02,wallstreetbets,Agreed- GameStop is drowning out solid DD. They’re all chasing insane gains from 1 stock when they could be following multiple stocks like this one :(
2021-04-13 12:51:48,wallstreetbets,"I love gme but I wanna see DD on something new.

Switching wsb to ""new"" posts and you get a whole other world of posts that aren't just gme and amc"

2021-04-13 14:36:44,wallstreetbets,If that's the case then why does it say that the 77 contracts were filled at $58 instead of the $150?
2021-04-13 16:51:46,wallstreetbets,Gain porn is like gay porn because the butt always hurts

they could have announced next week and OP's FDs would have been fucked. was priced at those premium levels for a reason."
2021-04-13 12:01:33,wallstreetbets,"IV is crazy. Premiums for even 10 dollars down the option chain (for 5/21, which is the next expiration) are currently 19.20 per contract. This week at that same strike are 7.50"
2021-04-13 15:01:22,wallstreetbets,"buying puts after a run up is the worst thing you can do. IV crush eats all gains. Going long any type of option is only smart when IV is low otherwise you are literally swimming against the tide.

smart money would be selling call premium right now"

2021-04-13 13:10:46,wallstreetbets,"Indeed. They're not fast plays (then again PLTR is super popular here) and sometimes they shit the bed, but the potential upside is huge.

2021-04-13 15:48:52,wallstreetbets,"I yolod an oil and gas penny stock ages ago and that plus reverse splits brought my cost basis for a sub$1 stock up to $8 and it’s still managing to trade in the dollar range.

Their leases are surrounded by the big boys who I think are just waiting for them to bleed out at this point and pick up the leases for cheap from the government."

2021-04-13 16:51:26,wallstreetbets,"For the retards that don’t get options- let me dumb it down for you on the OP’s play.

OP bought 77 contracts, which is 7,700 shares at 150$ per share. Then OP sold it 7,700 shares at 200$.  

Do the math- 200-150= 50 $ profit per share. He has 7,700 shares. 7,700* 50= 400,000$"
2021-04-13 15:13:13,wallstreetbets,He paid for a contract that allows him to buy the shares at $58 regardless of what the current price is.

2021-04-13 19:58:26,wallstreetbets,I bought in on 3/26 expecting it to bounce up to 150.  I just decided to hold thinking that I might be able to trade out on momentum since I had a low average.  I decided to hold and this just happened.

Still straddling the line as an adult but I have 2 pretty decent jobs I've maintained through the pandemic one with healthcare. I have a lot more free time now even still straddling the line because I don't have to be constantly looking for the next opportunity or exploit to make rent next month. I can just go into work and know that I'll be able to pay all my bills so my free time is really mine."

2021-04-13 16:14:09,wallstreetbets,"Especially since these things can sometimes be 2-3 day gap ups (or gap right the fuck back down).

Initial gap up -> settles for the day -> another gap up from renewed interest once they do due diligence.

I've been hurt a few times selling after a 30-40% gap up, only to see a 50%+ gap up the day after. But I've also seen it drop back just as quickly.

These things become unhinged, and some people are into that."
2021-04-13 19:02:22,wallstreetbets,"Sure, still a huge gain if you sell for less than actual value"

2021-04-13 11:29:38,wallstreetbets,I still hold a little AMD. Past 3 months has been all over the place due to supply shortage. So I've been buying TSM in hope
2021-04-13 11:50:44,wallstreetbets,What's the catalyst?
2021-04-13 11:35:12,wallstreetbets,"Of AMD, INTC, and NVDA, I am hoping for AMD the most.

However, despite months of good news for AMD, INTC and NVDA have gone up in price while AMD has fallen. Of course, INTC and NVDA have had a mix of news themselves.

Either that means AMD is a buy opportunity, INTC and NVDA are overbought by comparison and should be lower than they are, or AMD is a lost cause.

But if AMD can't hold a price level above 80 after releasing Milan CPUs (spoiler: it didn't), I don't know what it will take. I've been rooting for them since $8 (long before I started playing the market) and maybe their share price has simply grown too fast to keep going.

\*EDIT: This was the my original DD post on VIAC, pre-hedgy collapse. I am still VERY BULLISH on the stock, and recent events have opened a new opportunity for those who felt they missed the VIAC rocket to get on. The rocket has come back for you retards! Are you getting on this time, or will you stay and watch from afar like before?

\-Also, my price targets have not changed, but I do think the timing needs to be readjusted, but hey who knows what the future entails? Stranger things have happened....I just really like the stock!

That being said, welcome fellow retards, autists, apes and degenerates! There has been much DD already surrounding VIAC but I will repost all the links for you guys to read up on as we go along so you dont have to search for it on reddit. With the current battle going with GME, AMC and the hedgies, this ticker was easily overlooked.

VIAC has many things going for it, so excuse me if this shit seems all over the place. the more you read and understand, then the more you may agree that VIAC is a good investment.

Now lets talk about the GIANT that is ViacomCBS.

ViacomCBS comprises four major units:

* CBS Entertainment Group consists of CBS-branded assets, including the CBS television network, CBS News, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, CBS Media Ventures, Big Ticket Television, CBS Television Stations, and CBS Interactive. The unit also has a 50% interest in The CW television network joint venture co-owned by AT&T subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. division.\[47\]
* Domestic Media Networks encompasses the pay television channels owned byViacomCBS in the United States, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, BET, Comedy Central, TV Land, Paramount Network, Logo, CMT, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, VH1, The Movie Channel, and Flix. ViacomCBS Domestic also controls production facilities for the channels listed above, including Nickelodeon Animation Studio.
* International Networks encompasses certain international versions of the company's domestic channels, as well as region-specific networks, such as Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, Network 10 in Australia, and Telefe in Argentina. ViacomCBS International also owns a third\[48\] of the Rainbow S.r.l. television studio in Italy, as well as a 49% stake in the Viacom 18 joint venture with TV18.\[49\] This unit also includes all CBS-branded channels across Europe, which are co-owned with AMC Networks International.
* Global Distribution Group focuses on the global distribution of all programs produced by all ViacomCBS production studios. The division consists of ViacomCBS International Studios.

Other assets owned by ViacomCBS include the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, the company's flagship subscription streaming service Paramount+, over-the-top ad-supported video-on-demand platform Pluto TV, book publisher Simon & Schuster, multi-genre online video conference VidCon, mixed martial arts promoter Bellator, and media and entertainment company AwesomenessTV. As of November 2019, AwesomenessTV is overseen by its co-founder Brian Robbins, an executive for ViacomCBS Domestic. The company also has an undisclosed stake in FuboTV, acquired in 2020.

See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViacomCBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViacomCBS)

For a list of all assets owned by ViacomCBS: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_assets\_owned\_by\_ViacomCBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_ViacomCBS)

Viacom's audience reach is very broad, as their content is vast and appeals to all kinds of demographics. Let's talk about just Paramount Plus alone for. I know a bunch of fucktards didnt like the release of P+ but its not about just yourself, its about the potential appeal to other people who have likes and dislikes that differ from yourself.

P+ not only has a ton of content but also LIVE FUCKING SPORTS!!!!! Here's a look at the more than 1,000 live games P+ is bringing to the table:

* THE NFL ON CBS
* The Masters
* NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship
* PGA TOUR
* SEC ON CBS
* The PGA Championship
* National Women's Soccer League
* UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League -- *Paramount+ is the only place in the U.S. where soccer fans can find exclusive English-language coverage of every UEFA club competition match, every season.*

In addition, Paramount+ is expanding its exclusive English-language rights in the U.S. with three more soccer properties, featuring hundreds of additional matches.

* Concacaf -- offering more than 200 Concacaf matches, starting with the Concacaf Nations League Finals in June of this year, which will feature the U.S. Men's National Team. Coverage will feature all 41 national teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean across different competitions, including the qualifiers for the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023, which will feature the defending champion U.S. Women's National Team.
* Liga Profesional de Futbol -- Paramount+ will stream more than 300 matches a year from Argentina's top soccer division.
* Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A -- Paramount+ will stream more than 360 matches a year from Brazil's premier soccer league.

The service will also be the exclusive home of a long-running, original series ***Inside the NFL***. And knowing fans don't stop watching when the players stop playing, Paramount+ will feature CBS Sports HQ.

This is a no brainer. Sports brings in YUUUUUGE revenue and viewership and P+ will have many different kinds of sports that appeal to all kinds of viewers across the globe. Soccer is literally the most popular and watched sport in the world. Honestly from the sports side, all P+ is missing is Cricket. March Madness alone has broken revenue records and the month isn't even over!!!!! Even if corona were to shut it down, VIAC has already gotten more profit than they anticipated, any additional profit are just more blessings!

P+ will also have a bunch of original content coming in the next coming years. Here you can find a list of content coming to P+. [https://deadline.com/2021/02/paramount-programming-tv-series-films-streaming-viacomcbs-1234700647/](https://deadline.com/2021/02/paramount-programming-tv-series-films-streaming-viacomcbs-1234700647/)

The one that caught my interest the most was Halo. I remember I bought the Xbox console SOLEY for that game alone, along with millions of other fans. I suspect this alone would bring a lot of attention when released to P+.

ViacomCBS also has A LOT of their content licensed out to other companies such as Amazon and Netflix. ""Coming to America 2"" was made by Paramount Studios yet is streaming on Amazon. Why? Because of the shit ton of revenue it brings them.

""When Disney began developing Disney+, it reclaimed every last piece of programming it had licensed to Netflix (though Disney films released between Jan. 2016 and Dec. 2018 may return to Netflix in 2026). In doing so, the Mouse House sacrificed hundreds of millions of dollars in lucrative licensing revenue in order to build an exclusive in-house library. Yet Paramount Pictures spent 2020 selling off most of its theatrical features to rival streamers while Paramount Network licensed cable’s biggest hit (Yellowstone) exclusively to Peacock. Why? Because ViacomCBS President & CEO of Streaming Tom Ryan believes strategic licensing can be a boom for Paramount+ long-term even if it costs the streamer exclusive access."" See: [https://observer.com/2021/03/paramount-plus-icarly-netflix-viacomcbs-licensing/](https://observer.com/2021/03/paramount-plus-icarly-netflix-viacomcbs-licensing/)

Netflix has gotten significant attention for its massive spending on content. Over the last year, the company's spending on content topped $14.6 billion. ViacomCBS suggested it spent about $13 billion last year on content. It's no secret that spending on content seems to drive streaming revenue. However, some are speculating the company's recently announced $2.5 billion debt offering could be an act of desperation. There is little doubt that the coronavirus pandemic represents a significant challenge, yet ViacomCBS seems to be positioned better than some of its peers.

For those worried about closed movie theaters, last quarter the company's theatrical revenue equaled just under 2% of total revenue. It's true that advertising makes up the bulk of the company's revenue, yet the company's consistent high-quality content should continue to attract ad dollars. When people are stuck at home, it's likely they are going to watch more video. Whether that means Pluto TV, the traditional CBS, Showtime, or CBS All Access, the company should be able to grow its audience. As the public health crisis eventually fades, the returning ad dollars, combined with a bigger audience, should serve investors and the company well.

As proof that streaming seems to be the future of ViacomCBS, the company's subscription and video advertising business is expected to grow by 35% to 40%. ViacomCBS has multiple offerings driving its streaming business. The company's Pluto TV service increased its monthly active users in the U.S. by 75% annually. Paid streaming subscriptions increased by 50% year over year domestically. On the flip side, Netflix is witnessing a split in its membership growth. On the domestic side of the house, Netflix's paid memberships increased by a pedestrian 4.4% annually. International has become the company's growth engine, with paid memberships increasing by more than 31% year over year.

Though both ViacomCBS and Netflix are reporting solid growth in subscribers, the former generates significant free cash flow. In the past 12 months, ViacomCBS generated core free cash flow (FCF) of over $3.4 billion.

The coronavirus may challenge ViacomCBS' short-term results and cause volatility. However, with a yield of nearly 6% an almost comically low payout ratio, and a growing streaming business, this represents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors.

Don't forget Netflix is also cracking down on password sharing. As far as I know, P+ can be shared and streamed on multiple devices at once. I am always streaming my P+ on my computer 24/7 and can watch a soccer match from my mobile device at the same time. Also, P+ doesn't ask me if I am ""still watching"" like Netflix does after some time.

ViacomCBS also owns Paramount Pictures, a movie studio that has produced so much great content over the years. Last time I checked, movie theaters are PACKED and movie revenue will continue to explode as we get closer to the summer and as we get more people vaccinated.

Another interesting thing regarding ViacomCBS is that is currently trading with a P/E ratio of 24.22, much lower than Netflix(85.21), yet Netflix doesn't offer live sports or news and does not generate cable revenue. ViacomCBS is still undervalued and has a lot of room for growth. As of now, the public float of shares is around 543 million shares, while the amount of shares shorted on VIAC is about 19.36% (around 105 million shares). Along with that, there is high institutional ownership of shares (currently 93.86%, see: [https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VIAC&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VIAC&subView=institutional)) and is very possible that an there potential an activist investor has been buying up shares since August of last year. (see:[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/viacomcbs-surges-on-bet-that-an-activist-investor-will-emerge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/viacomcbs-surges-on-bet-that-an-activist-investor-will-emerge))

Institutional money has some of the BIGGEST diamond hands ever and they are seemingly continuing to buy up shares and hold, another reason you continue to see VIAC have a strong, daily uptrend. With such high institutional ownership and very low insider ownership (0.2% of total float), that leaves about 6% of shares left available (543 million shares).

see:[http://www.stocksequity.com/active-stocks/traders-should-take-notice-on-viacomcbs-inc-nasdaqviac-with-the-stream-of-3-26/](http://www.stocksequity.com/active-stocks/traders-should-take-notice-on-viacomcbs-inc-nasdaqviac-with-the-stream-of-3-26/)

Viacom operates a largely decentralized business model. It gets almost 80% of its revenues through a collection of network channels that include MTV, MTV2, VH1, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, TV Land, CMT, BET, and Spike. The rest of its revenues come from Paramount Pictures (film) and Harmonix (video games).

Those subsidiaries have their own management teams that are silo-ed off to act in their own self interest. Even when Sumner Redstone was in his physical prime and applied a micro-managing spirit to his holdings, he wasn’t make individual business decisions–he was firing the managers of his subsidiaries for not meeting his short-term expectations. This isn’t Steve Jobs orchestrating the iPhone; Sumner Redstone did not bring you SpongeBob.

While most Viacom shareholders are understandably paying attention to the public spat over board control, that is not the issue that would keep me up at night if I were a long-term shareholder. Considering that 80% of revenues come from network channels, my predominant focus would be: How many minutes are being delivered per month by the channels we own?

We’ve had four nasty recessions in the past century. These are illustrative for helping us figure out the durability of a company’s profits during times of deep distress and aid us in quantifying the harm posed by perceived risks. In the case of Viacom, it actually grew profits from $2.38 per share in 2008 to $2.56 per share in 2009. Profits went from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion even as minutes distributed through the network channels declined by 5%. Advertising rates plummeted, and minutes watched declined by a little bit, and yet the media giant still churned out more cash.

Viacom keeps its dividends in the low 30% payout ratio territory so that it can repurchase gobs of stock and boost earnings. It has repurchased 35% of its stock since 2010, taking the share count down from 608 million to 390 million. Viacom is one of the best companies lately when it comes to getting serious about reducing its share count.

Viacom is one of the best companies lately when it comes to getting serious about reducing its share count.

Profits have declined $200 million from $2.2 billion to $2.0 billion over the past five years. That also coincides with a significant period of buybacks so that earnings have actually grown from $3.78 per share in 2011 to somewhere in the low $5 range right now.

Put another way: Viacom the corporation has seen profits decline by 1.89% per year over the last five years, while Viacom shareholders have seen their profits climb by 6.17% per year over the past five years.

Edit: good read and news, more income for VIAC - [https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bellator-tv-rights-showtime-us-viacomcbs](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bellator-tv-rights-showtime-us-viacomcbs)

The Play:

I believe VIAC will see $175 or higher by EOY. I already have several calls at different strikes, but I plan on getting many more far OTM calls with 2023 expirations and plan on getting more shares. I believe anything after 4/16 expiration with $90-120 strikes would be a good call to look at.

👁️👁️👁️

\*EDIT: Although I still believe $175 EOY is possible, I think $150 is more likely and conservative. I can very much so see this stock at $200 in 2022. I have already gotten OTM LEAPS and will hold on to them like your wife holds her boyfriend at night. For shorter term calls, I would look at $52-$60 calls with at least 2-3 months to expiration, obviously more time is better. This week will be important, if the sell momentum has died down, the only other direction this stock can go is: UP!

👁️👁️👁️

Also I am anticipating YUGE sub growth in this year and next. Even if you hate their streaming service, I'm willing to be that you have watched at least 1 VIAC produced show or movie on any of the other stream services you do like and subscribe to. They are going to make money either from you directly subscribing or you watching their content on other services....\*cough\*coming to america 2\*cough\*....

👁️👁️👁️

I can imagine a scenario where others who like the stock also like and support the stream with a sub, and unlike other services like Netflix that stops streaming after some time asking you ""are you still watching"", Paramount Plus doesn't. I mean hey, I LOVE VIAC and I LOVE P+ so much that I just  
👁️watch👁️ shows 24/7. I would love to 👁️watch👁️ all their content, although I do fall asleep at sometimes, but the shows and movies keep playing, so I NEVER MISS OUT. Even while at work, on my other computer I leave the shows 👁️playing👁️ so I NEVER MISS ANYTHING. Could you imagine others loving the stock and company like I do, 👁️watching👁️ all their content NONSTOP? I could only imagine their upcoming 👁️earnings report👁️ would be insane in that case, and would do wonders to my lovely stock... but again, I'm retarded so what the hell do I know right?

👁️👁️👁️

If you know, you know.... 👁️👁️👁️

Now I also believe there may be a great opportunity here for those who has been hurt or downed in the battle of GME and AMC, and there has been MANY. Look to VIAC as the healing spell that has been cast on the market. VIAC can rejuvenate your tendies, so you can have more ammo to fight against the hedgies! Should you choose let VIAC heal you, I suggest you leave some tendies with VIAC to continue to grow and multiply, just in case if you go back and goto the GME or AMC fight and get hurt or down in battle once again. That way you can return to the VIAC tendies you had left and didnt touch, which have now created tendie clones that you can use once again in the GME and AMC battle, should you choose to do so! For the battle of GME and AMC will be long and drawn out, you must be adequately prepared!!! TENDIES MAKES MORE TENDIES!!!!

VIAC is the water of life, it heals all those who are weary from battle! Use this power wisely, fellow retards, autists, apes and degenerates!

AGAIN, THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!!!! I AM VERY RETARDED, I LOVE TO EAT CRAYONS, MY FAVORITE IS THE GREEN ONE, IT TASTES LIKE $100 BILLS!!

2021-04-13 11:11:27,wallstreetbets,I'm long VIAC for some time now. Makes no sense such a company to trade so low that it may go under book value (\~25$ as of Dec 2020).

2021-04-13 11:09:19,wallstreetbets,"So, in the space that VIAC is in, who is their biggest competitor? Also, how do they plan to grow? I see that obviously they have a cash cow that's going to print (sports), but they don't seem to have a lot of cash on hand which is worrying. I know it's not going to drop much from where it currently sits, but I am expecting it to stay flat for a while until we see some big catalysts."

2021-04-13 12:10:37,wallstreetbets,"Only positive that I can see is their sport offering. Rest is mediocre.

The TV stations they own across the world are second/third tier apart from their kids channels.

They've really struggled with box office movies. Having a major film go straight to streaming is TERRIBLE. They did have strong success with Sonic, A Quiet Place was really strong a 3 years ago, Rocketman was good too, and they have mission Impossible movies keeping them going, but you will rarely see them competing for any Oscars. Big box office hits to watch out for are snake eyes and Tomorrow something (I forgot the name), but still nothing really exciting. Disney, Fox (now owned by Disney), Warner, Sony pictures/Columbia have all had greater success over the last few years and looking at Paramount's direction I can't see that changing (Paramount loves a good sequel over anything original).

Your price targets are laughable - yeah it might grow by a few percentages this year (not much though, if it closes this year at over 50 I'd be surprised), but a p/e of over 20 is quite high already for what they produce, comparing it to Netflix is dumb. Netflix is already overvalued but at least they've shown to be innovators in the past. 

Best of luck with this, but you're portraying a typical boomer stock as something exciting, which it isn't really..."

That’s already 8 billion. They used some of that money to acquire Chilevision to help with the expansion in Latin America. They also secured Serie A. So much going for this company and they’re very diverse with their content. 👁
2021-04-13 11:40:34,wallstreetbets,There are plenty of other DD out there that do...
2021-04-13 12:25:44,wallstreetbets,"TV stations are second tier? Idk about global but CBS routinely has the highest ratings among network tv.  Current p/e is around 10 right now. I think 20 would be the high-water mark in my opinion, but that would suggest a market value of $80/share. I think 150 is a super aggressive and highly unlikely bar some huge P+ signup shenanigans.

Disney loves sequels too. We have seen that leveraging existing IP is pretty powerful. However, I agree that is their weakest arm. That being said, I don't think Oscar contention is the biggest thing as everyone seems to just buy highly rated Indie flicks to get prestige these days. With their 8B in cash on hand they can compete in this realm quickly if needed.

As I said, I agree with some of your points and think this DD is out there (like nearly every DD on this sub).  However, I think 60 for short term is a reasonable target and 80 EOY is not crazy (100 possible but that would take a massive beat an the announcement of some exciting new streaming only series, along with some good movie acquisitions).

2021-04-13 11:17:29,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. Thank you for the info. I've been eyeing VIAC and might do a bit more research on my own before jumping in.
2021-04-13 14:12:57,wallstreetbets,"You're right for CBS in USA it's the highest for total ratings. To be fair I don't work in the US so I didn't know, but in Europe, LATAM, Oceania, Viacom channels are tier 2/tier 3 at best (apart from kids, where it's top tier with turner and disney). To note, most tier 1 channels only operate in one country, so I wouldn't be too upset by it. Also looking at total ratings doesn't tell the whole story - ratings on Adults 18-49 are much more valuable than older ones, and channels that skew towards Men also deliver higher ad revenue.

~~Current P/E is 10 if you look at Yahoo Finance, if you look at ViacomCBS and look at their actual figures, it's over 20 ($3.93 EPS). Yahoo Finance is great for an overview, but you need to do your due diligence over that by looking at the company's results that they report.~~ I'm so fucking dumb, you're right P/E is close to 10. I guess I forgot how to divide 40/3.93...

Yes, but Disney has a pedigree of delivering excellent films that people go to see. Looking at their finances, Box Office isn't a main revenue driver anyway so it's fair to say you can ignore it. However if they start building strong franchises, then who knows, Viacom might be a strong investment, but looking at what they have coming in this year, it won't be soon. Oscar winning films tend to be part of the $100M club, maybe not the same as the $1B club Avengers is in, but still very strong. Paramount might get 1 film a year in that bracket, could be a couple this year if you consider Mission Impossible a shoe-in to reach that, and then you hope for the best that one of their other big blockbusters is a success.

Re 8B in cash, sure that's strong. 10B total if you count receivables (3B in actual cash). Still 8B in current liabilities, but I am surprised to see such a strong balance sheet vs 2019, I thought with how media was impacted this year it would be worse, but it's significantly better. Fair play.

60 is a good target, but don't be surprise if it doesn't get there this year or even the next 3 years. It's a stock that is really safe and tends to trade flat as it doesn't really see any significant increase in net revenue.

As you said, I'd much rather have these discussions on this sub than the echo chamber we've seen on some other stocks. I won't be touching this as I like a bit of risk in my investments (stocks with an opportunity to be a double bagger in a year, if not more. I say that but I do own Sony, so take whatever I say with a pinch of salt). Overall I like Viacom as I used to be one of their vendors in one of their segments, but for me, it's got a long way to go before it grows substantially to be an even bigger media conglomerate.

Also would be interesting to compare the financials vs Disney, but then again In this sector it's hard as you're never comparing apples with apples, like you don't buy AT&T because it owns Warner or Sony because it owns SPE/SPT/SPHE, it's only part of it."

You just backed up my claim with the EPS. You have to remember that the historical number of 20 was when the stock was flying high. P/E is a dynamic number and saying it is 20 after a drop by 50% in stock price is just wrong. It was 20 when they released their financials, but now it is 10, which is why I say it is undervalued.  I can't believe your confidence when being wrong."

2021-04-13 14:33:34,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. Happens to us all. For what it is worth, I think you are ignoring kids movies (sponge bob, paw patrol, etc) for major box office success (not to mention that it is unclear if that is even going to be a good measure, just going off the Netflix model with movies like Roma). 

You bring up some good points that I don't disagree with, but I think their back catalog and sports, combined with children's programming will drive robust P+ signups will push the value to 80-100/share where the stagnation you point out will become an issue."
2021-04-13 14:50:09,wallstreetbets,"Fair point on kids movies. Streaming platforms seem very saturated to me right now. I think there have been loads of major additions in the last 2/3 years, with Disney +, Peacock, Apple TV, Britbox + whatever else is out there, but I guess it's hard to ignore it as you risk getting becoming irrelevant. Sports still remains a very competitive market with ESPN, Fubo, sport specific streaming services and Peacock (which reminds me I forgot to mention Universal in my Hollywood movie studios).

Best of luck with your investment!"

Short interest increases everyday by 10% recently... 100+ million shorted shares, 96% owned float.. It's just a sitting ticking time bomb. 

Wait for AMC CEO interview with TreyTrades on Youtube for the dilution, but by then we will have squeezed. This stock is waiting for news, and once it gets some... It's going to explode.

I have a friend that would be considered 2nd generation wealthy.  Retired early and managed his money well enough to live a luxurious life by most peoples' standards.  He will definitely have enough money to share with the kids to help with down payments for houses and such, but they are going to have to work lol.

His parents grew up extremely poor and started a very successful business that he and his brother helped manage.  He got out in his early 40s but kept the land the business was on.  Basically had a covered call on the land.  Rent for a minimum of 10 years with the option to buy at over market value after the 10 years are up.  I think the rent for the land was about $30k/month so he did alright.  

Only one of his kids seems to be focused on a 'work for assets until the assets work for you' mindset.  I don't think the others invest at all but I could be wrong."

2021-04-13 18:02:20,wallstreetbets,"Agreed! Anybody who thinks the theatre business and specifically AMC is done clearly has no concept of what the public wants and how many billion dollar franchise films will be released in the next 365 days. The hype from Reddit actually has helped more people realize that they miss going to the movies. And you cant compare going to the movies with streaming at home.

But, with the short borrow fee tripling this morning and utilization being at 96%, they may be headed for a wall to slow down their shorting.

Sooo.... Maybe? Probably not?"
2021-04-13 14:55:56,wallstreetbets,"And AMC is currently the most heavily shorted stock, even more than GME. This is not meant to poo poo on GME, it's clear that there are far more shares in circulation than exist with GME, on top of the shorts that are still there. But with that said, AMC is at its highest levels of short interest, shares borrowed, and is at 96% utilization. All this with apes holding above 88% of the shares.

Disclosure. long & strong on $PFE. Do your own DD but here is some of mine. Been in it since low 30s. Moves like a 🐌 

It’s a solid company, 2021 is going to big catalyst due to C19 vaccine, low P/E. Upside potential is huge

Pfizer plans to produce 1B vaccines in 2021.  cost is roughly $10/vaccine. If they can make this happen it’ll be 500M doses. Requires 2 doses. That could mean upwards of +10B in additional revenue including sales & all the govt funding. 

Pfizer getting approval for higher storage temp. This will ease burden on cold supply chain, improve supply and longer life. 

Pfizer is also working on supply chain improvements, moving things in-house to speed up production and control. 

Supply & Production only gets better with time. 

If they hit all targets, they should see +10B revenue increase. That’s +20% increase v 2020. High side they add +20B in rev this year"
2021-04-13 10:12:15,wallstreetbets,"Yerp. Bought LEAPS in the way back when I first heard they were working on vaccines. Sold the news. Converted profits to equity. Bought another LEAPS on the way down, slow and steady ride up, been running a PMCC, never through earnings. Premiums are low but consistent.

Its a good company. Profits arent going anywhere. Profits support dividend. Its about as boomer as boomer stonks come. 

Side note, of the available vaccines anecdotes are Pfizer has the least side effects. Thats the beat on the street. Vaccine is just fueling revenue and paying back development costs, no real profits."
2021-04-13 11:28:59,wallstreetbets,It's at 70 RSI rn though. At least wait before buying in if anybody is considering hopping in immediately.
2021-04-13 13:54:02,wallstreetbets,"Thought the same thing last year... Didn't work out too well. They're a $210B company. Just too big for a one year revenue bump to matter IMO, but good luck."
2021-04-13 16:38:59,wallstreetbets,Whats the next DD? 3M?
2021-04-13 16:41:58,wallstreetbets,FD I own 100 shares but the revenue and profit bump from the vaccine is viewed as a one off. Not a source of long term recurring revenue and profit. That's why the stock continues to trade well below 40. They will have to turn this one trick pony (MRNA tech) into additional vaccines and treatments for other diseases.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Inflation impulse sets off precious metals, once they get going it can snowball quickly. Some advice for anyone looking to jump into Silver or Gold This is a quick DD just getting a few facts out there in case anyone searches WSB for gold or silver today in light of inflation picking up.

First, on the ‘Citadel owns SLV’ line. SLV is garbage so it kind of makes sense. Secondly, citadel is a market maker. They are long and short pretty much every stock, so good luck avoiding anything they have their hands on. Thirdly, it’s a minuscule portion of their portfolio. Net long position likely less than 0.1% of their AUM.

The fed is likely to cap rates as they respond to to higher inflation.  They might not announce anything, but look at the size of their purchases when the data comes out.  In many ways they’ve already begun YCC.

This means that as inflation expectations rise, real yields fall because nominal yields are capped.  This is extremely positive for gold and silver.

I prefer silver to gold because in a raging bull market for PMs, silver will greatly outperform gold.

Silver’s industrial and jewelry use is coming closer to eclipsing the annual production. You may not know that silver is used in solar panels, electric cars, and really anything that’s electronic and expensive. This is because it is the most conductive of all elements.  If you are bullish on green tech, silver is a natural play. As monetary demand comes in, it just doesn’t have the capacity to absorb it, which is why it can spike.

You may remember the silver squeeze movement that took off for about 3 days on WSB back in late January.  Barely anyone joined that train as virtually everyone was still playing GME (and still are, keep holding GME brothers) and yet it still had a fairly large impact.

The supply situation is far tighter today than it was 2.5 months ago, so people jumping in the silver train now will be far more impactful. 

Also, we’ve learned that SLV is a scam, and silver surfers probably shot themselves in the face by buying it.

Here’s a very long DD that explains it. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv_is_a_complete_scam_its_a_scalp_trade_set_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Broken into 3 parts, that DD addresses SLV being a scam, the silver short squeeze, and the fundamental case for silver.

Essentially to properly buy silver through an ETF you need to buy PSLV, not SLV.

In the silver squeeze world there are many ways to play it,

PSLV is like buying shares, it directly contributes to the snowballing of the squeeze. It’s also highly marginable so you can get a leveraged pure play on the metal if you want

Miners are like call options on the metal, but also frequently mine other things than just silver and carry political risk and other types of risk, not a complete pure play, but some of them can be very close

There are also call options on miners. 

Most of the miners are too small in terms of market cap to post here unfortunately.

If you want more info go read the longer DD I posted in the link above!

PSLV, not SLV




Also:  PSLV was also banned on Robinhood a few months ago, so if you are still using that shitty broker please switch to one that won’t try to screw your at every turn"

2021-04-13 14:38:41,wallstreetbets,"Buy the miners. Look how much the miners moved up when gold went up last summer. And they are basically all on fire sale right now.

They paid off all their debt. They are pulling in $2 billion in profit every quarter. Increasing their dividends. Currently the price is super low."

The estimated global production of silver in 2020 amounted to 25,000 metric tons. Production of this precious metal has thus increased considerably from the production volume of 20,800 in 2005

2021-04-13 16:17:51,wallstreetbets,"If you invest in metals I highly suggest actually buying silver or gold coins instead of using paper/etf markets. 

1.  Some states like CA do not charge sales tax on purchases and sales above ~$1,000. This is huge.

2.  Metal coins have a collector’s value inherent to them. Keep them in their US mint packaging.

3. Don’t buy Chinese or other shady gold. 

4.  Buy from a local dealer. You can sell back to them later.

5.  Don’t put more than 10% of your portfolio in metals. They won’t beat the stonk market in the long term.  Don’t listen to nut jobs like Peter Schiff who is long gold like a squirrel is for acorns."
2021-04-13 14:57:05,wallstreetbets,Correction FYI gold is more conductive than silver. That's why the price of silver is not likely to exceed the price of gold as gold can be substituted for silver in electronic applications if the price justifies it. What is also likely is silver will be substituted for larger amounts of copper when applicable for some applications as prices rise. I personally don't think this will have a huge impact on the actual silver prices as the bull is unleashed but just want people here to stay realistic and not start touting outlandish ideas. Silver is still needed in some applications but once it reaches the same price as gold they will likely trade 1:1 for a while (months? years?) and eventually the supply and demand will equilibrate back to a more historic silver:gold ratio ( say 14:1)

There is no way this is a feasible dd without the other side. They could likely short indefinitely. They can and will break the rules. Hedgies in SLV ownes the ETF and could just fudge the books or issue more shares.

2021-04-13 14:01:45,wallstreetbets,"Lets see... Gold was worth more 40 years ago than it is today, even though it's in a massive inflation-induced bull run. An extremely volatile asset that doesn't outperform inflation, questionable backing of gold certificates, hard to store and move physically, was already confiscated nation-wide by the government once, one of the most counterfeited substances on earth with significant difficulties to test it for an average retail guy. On top of all that - it's not as limited in supply as people think, over entire human history we managed to mine only about 1% of Earth's gold - the only limiting factor for how much gold we can get is the price of gold itself (more incentives to do expensive extraction when the price is high). So yeah, I think I'll pass."

2021-04-13 17:10:02,wallstreetbets,Real rates do not decline with higher inflation unless there is some sort of Fed intervention. To date the Fed has quietly begun to unwind their easy policies. They let the 10 year rise to over 1.7% from .9% without operation twist or any adjustment to bond purchases. They also let SLR expire which allowed rates to additionally increase in March. Bullard just said that the Fed may begin to debate tapering sooner rather than later. They are laying the ground work for higher long term interest rates along with higher inflation expectations. LT rates will move higher in step with inflation or even higher and your gold and silver will be crushed.

2021-04-13 10:15:02,wallstreetbets,"I've bought from two places - sdbullion with a dot com, and from some guy with a good rep called MilesFranklin with a dot com.  Miles you actually have to call to order from, which I actually enjoyed as he was happy to provide suggestions AND it isn't something that is as easy to trace (I dont' trust the gov much, so anything that makes it less likely they know what I do is good).  Investing in PSLV is a great second step, but almost everyone that follows silver suggests having somewhere between 5-15% of your monies in silver/gold.  silver looks like it has the best moonshot potential, with gold having a nice climb in potential, but not a moonshot (as far as % gain I mean).  
I would buy physical at whatever price I can get it at if I had none until I had at least 5%, then for the next 5% I would compare a few places. Right now, premiums can be high (meaning they say online that silver's $25 an ounce, but to buy it, you have to pay $25 + premium of $XX.XX over that price depending on the coin one is buying.  
The cheapest and cloest to spot is 'junk silver' which are typically old coinage with silver in it. widely recognized and reliable, but not as pretty, so smallest premium. I have a good bit of that, and the other half(ish) is in specific coins of varying designs based on what was available when I ordered.

For the record, if one goes with MilesFranklin, they'll match any price you can find anywhere else, so ask him for his recommendation and then check his price against something like sdbullion of the dot com and if his price isn't lower already, just say you see it there for XX.XX price and he'll almost certainly match it or beat by a small amount."

There's a lot of upside and the downside compared to stocks is minimal. Even if prices floor(2020 they hit $12/oz) Losing 60% of value is a substantially lower risk than any stock."
2021-04-13 10:48:50,wallstreetbets," I bought at AP MEX, using a certain electronic currency that I can't mention on this sub. Took about a month for them to finally ship, but the rate you pay locks in at buy time, not ship time. That could, of course, be either good or bad. 1kg bars are about $1000. They're about the size of a deck of cards. They're fun to have around. You can buy bigger bars, but I figured any larger and they'd be harder to sell when the time comes. I don't plan to sell mine for decades, though."

Any broker-dealer as an authorized participant can redeem baskets of shares on behalf of shareholders. You are  responsible for delivery expenses. Each basket is 500,000 ounces delivered in silver bars. If you want to take delivery from slv buy 500k shares from an authorized dealer broker and tell them where to delivery it to.

This is sprouts prospectus

""Redemption of Trust Units for Physical Silver Bullion 
Unitholders whose trust units are redeemed for physical silver bullion will be entitled to receive a redemption price 
equal to 100% of the NAV of the redeemed units on the last day of the month on which NYSE Arca is open for trading for 
the month in respect of which the redemption request is processed. Redemption requests must be for amounts that are at least 
equivalent to the value of ten London Good Delivery bars or an integral multiple of one bar in excess thereof, plus applicable 
expenses. A “London Good Delivery bar” weighs between 750 and 1,100 troy ounces (approximately 23 to 34 kilograms) 
and usually are approximately 1,000 troy ounces. Any fractional amount of redemption proceeds in excess of ten London 
Good Delivery bars or an integral multiple of one bar in excess thereof will be paid in cash at a rate equal to 100% of the 
NAV of such excess amount. The ability of a unitholder to redeem trust units for physical silver bullion may be limited by 
the sizes of London Good Delivery bars held by the Trust at the time of redemption. A unitholder redeeming units for 
physical silver bullion will be responsible for expenses in connection with effecting the redemption and applicable delivery 
expenses, including the handling of the notice of redemption, the delivery of the physical silver bullion for units that are 
being redeemed and the applicable fees charged by the Mint in connection with such redemption, including but not limited to 
silver storage redemption fees, pallet repackaging fees and administrative fees. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unitholders that are constituted and authorized as Undertakings for Collective 
Investments in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”) or are otherwise prohibited by their investment policies, guidelines or 
restrictions from receiving physical silver bullion may only redeem trust units for cash. 
Since inception, 2,536,802 trust units have been redeemed for physical silver bullion. 
A unitholder that owns a sufficient number of units who desires to exercise redemption privileges for physical silver 
bullion must do so by instructing his, her or its broker, who must be a direct or indirect participant of CDS Clearing and 
Depository Services Inc. or The Depository Trust Company, to deliver to the Trust’s transfer agent, TSX Trust Company, on 
behalf of the unitholder a written notice (the “Silver Redemption Notice”) of the unitholder’s intention to redeem trust units ""

It's literally the same exact setup as SLV except PSLV allows you to redeem just 100oz instead of it having to be 500k ounces (for an additional 2% admin fee thou that slv doesn't have) PSLV is also more easily worded then SLV is.

I'm sorry for spazzing before. I'm bipolar so not stable im having trouble getting medication and was having a very bad episode earlier today and all these conspiracy theories I keep seeing are ruining this subreddit.

The silver squeeze is real for macro reasons. Whether you buy SLV or PSLV makes no difference they are the same thing."

Naturally, the hedge funds and market makers would rather have us squeeze silver instead of GME. But that doesn’t mean there’s no truth to the silver squeeze. It’s no secret the silver market is heavily manipulated. 

That’s why I plan on buying silver after GME/AMC squeeze. The people to watch out for are those who are saying to sell GME/AMC before it squeezes, no matter what investment they are pushing."
2021-04-13 11:47:54,wallstreetbets,All I'm saying is why did the romans stop putting silver in their coins and what happened next? The whole silver movement is about putting less than 5% of your portfolio into silver (or gold). Nothing else. Stop with the conspiracy theories

# What is Delta Neutral?

Delta neutral is a portfolio strategy utilizing multiple positions with balancing positive and negative [deltas](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp) so that the overall delta of the assets in question totals zero.

I'm not going to explain what delta is in any level of depth. If you don't know what it is get the fuck out of this forum and go read on the internet. We often thing of delta as a rate of change in price of our option but it's anything but static.

Delta neutral is actually very simple. You sum all of your positions for a particular underlying. If it's 0 congrats you're delta neutral. Delta neutral is ideal but it's nearly impossible to maintain because price changes so often. If you're an MM that's fine you have billions at your disposal but most of us can't do that shit.

Simple example: You have a put with a delta of -.3 and you have 30 shares.

The short position

1 Put ( 100 \* -.3 = -30 Delta)

The long position

30 shares = (30 \* +1 = 30 Delta)

30Delta (long) + -30 Delta (short) => Delta Neutral (0)

Let's say the price goes down and now your put is now Delta = -.35 (gamma of -0.05)

Your short position has now created a delta negative position which means you disproportionately benefit if 📉 but you get rekt if 📈. To get your position back in balance you would need to acquire 5 shares.

New positions post price movement of $1

The short position

1 Put (100 \* -.35 = -35 Delta )

The long position

35 shares = (35 \* +1Delta = 35Delta)

Okay great... now do it every time the price changes a dollar up or down.

No surprise you can't keep doing this shit. This level of day trading isn't in the cards for most of us.

Why does delta change?

The closer an option is to ITM or further ITM the closer it will converge to 1:1 ratio of price change. I say converge because options can not have 0 or 1 delta. The fact that they have extrinsic value means it's impossible. Say you have a 1C on underlying that's 5000. You're $4999 ITM which means the intrinsic value of the option is going to nearly mirror the movement of the underlying price. If you have a 5000C on a call that's underlying $1. Congrats you wasted money and your delta is likely around .0001 or something stupid like that.

Let's look at it graphically since I know you fucking idiots don't like reading.

Gaze 'pon ye olde Delta chart for calls.

Obviously these are approximations but the key takeaway is that delta is asymptotic. That means it will never be 0 or 1, it will change rapidly around the middle and rapidly decelerate toward the ends. I feel like we covered this enough. I don't want to distract you retards from jerking off to only fans and watching that show you've seen for the 9th time through.

A final peak on an actual option chain so you can observe the curve.

[https://preview.redd.it/rqr62cq8ias61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcdc607de18253a85a0c5b83f05b73071c55bbe2](https://preview.redd.it/rqr62cq8ias61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcdc607de18253a85a0c5b83f05b73071c55bbe2)

You can see the proximity to price with respect to strike is what correlates to the delta. Delta is a function of difference between underlying price, strike price of position and gamma. That's an oversimplification but you don't want to see the math formulas do you?

Here's an example case I made to observe change in Delta over price change for a single long position.

[Don't be fucking stupid. Delta converges at 1. I'm just lazy and didn't add the MIN formula to the excel sheet. In this example I chose around 110 for the ITM mark.](https://preview.redd.it/wi3rmq7gias61.png?width=290&format=png&auto=webp&s=64ef93f01bb4f3e2e4c0b46a44da206600a795d8)

This is why the FDs sometimes print harder than jpow... just kidding jpow. But seriously this is the dream we all look for when it comes to buying options. Watching something far otm get good price movement and watching gamma inject delta with massive print potential for us.

Don't be deceived by this example. Gamma is not static. Gamma is 0 when you're ITM as you can't have a Delta above 1. Gamma is also nearly 0 when you're so far OTM that it basically doesn't matter. Say if you bought a 800c on something trading for like 180... which I'm sure no one here every does.

Look at this actual gamma curve.

[https://preview.redd.it/75h0wbofjas61.png?width=206&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d3d4a5f2430dd0c337d81cdf97fbc0afd7d6153](https://preview.redd.it/75h0wbofjas61.png?width=206&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d3d4a5f2430dd0c337d81cdf97fbc0afd7d6153)

In the middle of the bell curve is where delta is basically .5. small shifts in underlying change cause massive shift in option price change relatively speaking. Again when you're on the fringes => super ITM or super OTM your gamma is 0 because your delta really can't change unless it completely violently reverses itself.

# Gamma Squeeze

There's been a ridiculous amount of talk about gamma squeezes and very little talk about how they mechanically work. Again I'll keep this brief and try to use pictures so I don't hurt anyone's smooth brain. JK read a book retard.

Remember that we talked about delta neutral positions and how it's important as a market maker to remain delta neutral to mitigate risks. Well gamma squeezes are actually fairly simple and I think I've explained it before but not as elaborately as this. The way it must work is the buying pressure of the short position holders to become delta neutral or cover their positions must thrust the price upward triggering delta changes which then again trigger more covering and delta neutral buying. I made some pictures for you dickheads.

# Warning: This next image has math

[https://preview.redd.it/k2kg08p46bs61.png?width=1405&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ce64da8f8fef106bc815fe01a193207a55589a5](https://preview.redd.it/k2kg08p46bs61.png?width=1405&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ce64da8f8fef106bc815fe01a193207a55589a5)

Here's an example of a failure. This shows that although there was a proper ladder of options bought that could have forced the gamma squeeze there simply was not enough buying pressure in the period to force the gamma squeeze. Take a very close look at some of the option levels. Stupid humans like round numbers for some reason so we like to buy lots of options around the '50' or '100' levels in underlying. This is a fictional piece I made up that should illustrate the point.

[https://preview.redd.it/imtdd8yd1bs61.png?width=1597&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c55589e36441728cde6a695ffd9748a3139ec92](https://preview.redd.it/imtdd8yd1bs61.png?width=1597&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c55589e36441728cde6a695ffd9748a3139ec92)

Do not obsess over this silly little picture. It's impossible to make excel really show gamma squeeze because excel does not like circular references and that's literally what I'm trying to explain.

I thought I was fucking up my excel formulas and then I realized that no fuck you excel, gamma squeezes are in fact a self perpetuating problem and effectively a circular reference. So I can't show you a perfect excel sheet that works.

I couldn't even calculate the Actual delta because it's dependent on price movements which are dependent on shares needed to cover which is dependent on delta etc.

Take note that the buying in the column is far less than the shares needed to cover the short sold positions. But what if there was more buying pressure on the underlying? Say we got those shares we needed to push the price up. We'd start to see a chain reaction. The short position holders would increasingly become the buyers of long shares.

Look at the left ""Gamma Movements"" That's the same as the number the price on the underlying has increased by one. A gamma movement as I'm describing it is an action in buying sufficient enough to push the price up by $1. This causes gamma to increase delta which then causes more buying from the short position holders to be gamma neutral and the cycle continues.

The key is to have enough ATM/ITM options to force gamma neutral hedging. I already explained that ATM and ITM have the highest delta and thus will cause the most hedging for short position holders. Those ATM/ITM positions are also the most profitable / least risky in the event of a failure to sqoz.

It's outrageously odd to see a proper gamma squeeze happen so don't bank on seeing one any time soon. I just wanted to try to illuminate some of these mechanics as I understand them.

My explanations aren't perfect because I'm not. At least I'm putting something effort into it.

2021-04-13 10:08:50,wallstreetbets,"You do understand that there are ways for market makers to trade options themselves in order to remain gamma or delta neutral, right? I think your understanding and calculations only take into account the use of stocks or shorts as a hedge, rather than the full buffet of options available. In essence, you’re using addition on calculus.        

Edit: before you think OP is actually smart instead of just copy/pasting stuff, here are some examples of when people accused me of being wrong and stupid, but in hindsight it probably could have saved a few lives if they had listened to me.          

Please understand that the second you start playing with IV and theta, it throws all of the delta and gamma hedging out the window since there is so much spread trading on high IV stock.            

Good luck to anyone who tries to use OP’s example as an outlier for options trading. I thought the same way my first few weeks of options trading back when I made no money.

however it is late and i have one burning ape question:

&#x200B;

a large portion of OTM puts for a random share ($MOON) are at 4-10$.

the $MOON is at 140$.

according to my understanding of your post, these puts literally have no effect on price movement because of delta close to -1 ? so gamma is very low at these delta values.

&#x200B;

are such puts literally a waste of money if not slightly ATM (say delta between - 0.7 and -0.4)?

in other words: would HFs with already existing short positions benefit from buying such puts?

“I would hope people would realize if one option changes position delta more options mean more position delta.”     

That is when you proved you’re a retard. If you don’t understand how buying options to hedge other options doesn’t really increase delta, but instead increases IV which in reality drops delta due to the theta offset over time(not truly applicable to a day trade lasting minutes, but applicable to a high IV over a few hours like gamestonk). You’re trying to act like you understand options, but you think of it as a concept based around addition and subtraction instead of something with multiple variables. In short, you’re acting like a retard.

Delta neutral is a portfolio strategy utilizing multiple positions with balancing positive and negative deltas so that the overall delta of the assets in question totals zero.

Women have autoimmune disorders at something like 9:1 compared to men. It's no surprise to me that all the vaccinated people affected were women. Their bodies overreacted to some component of the adenovirus in the JNJ vaccine or the translated protein formed.

This is about a stock that was already arguably overweight and just riding the hype of having a vaccine not only losing that hype, but also losing days or weeks of revenue from it.

J&J was already only 5% of the vaccines administered in the US where we're quickly reaching a point of finding people willing to get the vaccine being more of an issue than supply of the vaccine. Absolutely nobody is going to be clamoring for the shot they get to be the J&J shot going forward whether it's 6 out of 6.8 million or 6 out of 68 million.

Anecdotal.

> this is such a minuscule number it’s totally trying to scare the public

The number doesn't matter, the halt does. Especially in a landscape where there was already superior competition and they were only 5% of the market share in the US. Now what they've sold so far has been largely at cost, but what we're talking about is the potential and revenue going forward, which this will now create almost none. Because for ever anecdote you can come up with to support it, the largest group of people who walk in to get one will have just as many to pick one of the others.

You're literally just making a case for vaccines in general and applying it to this vaccine because you think that the argument against it is anti-vax. It's not, it's common sense. It was a rushed product where significant cracks are already forming, vastly inferior to its competitors in every way but the convenience of a single shot. 

$JNJ barely beat earnings estimates last quarter and soared on the back of having this promising vaccine. It's not longer promising and didn't make them any kind of real money, but has significant liabilities going forward.

The problem here is that you're trying to make the moral argument of ""risk vs. reward,"" about getting vaccinated at all rather than looking at the reality of its potential going forward. And I'm sorry to tell you, but there isn't really any. It has been halted and all of the math still points to it having no impact on the adoption rate of a COVID vaccine in general in the US. It's an unnecessary entry at this point.

So I'm sorry that you've come up with all of this fancy logic of why it's not that dangerous, but the reality is that its still the most dangerous option in an oversaturated marketplace... Go look at what happens to an airline when they have a plane crash, even though the odds of one of their planes crashing remains astronomically low. 

We've known for awhile that we were reaching the point where we have more doses than people willing to get them. And it's why we've known about the blood clot thing being a possible issue for weeks, but just now being pressing enough for these doses to be halted.

Note 7 owners were more likely to be struck by lightning than have the phone blow up, but that didn't stop virtually every user from looking for an alternative.

Nobody is trying to scare the public, stop trying to make this a crusade. This is just a realistic outlook on both the business aspects of this halt as well as the reality of what such early issues with the vaccine mean for it going forward. There are two perfectly good vaccines people are going to get instead.

But again, it's your money, torch it over the next few weeks if you want. Personally, I'd never trade based on morality rather than reality, but that's just me. The administration that is choosing to halt this is a big supporter of vaccines, there's absolutely no reason you should be making this a crusade about the government trying to scare you."

This:

This entire thing hinges around the fact its an unneeded third party in the vax roadmap and it's a shame a lot of people are going to lose money betting on it tp rebound. $JNJ was a shitty play before the halt because people bought in thinking they were making big money in the short term on these when they weren't, any potential it had was in long term doses once the pandemic was over and it would be more socially acceptable for them to charge more than cost.

Sure they have a ton of other products... and they were priced accordingly for that before the pandemic. I don't even have a dog in this fight, I bought $155 calls for 3 cents each when the blood clotting thing first popped up, sold them at open for 80 cent each. At this point I'm just trying to point out the semi-longterm reality of the company."
2021-04-13 14:38:40,wallstreetbets,"Again, you're arguing the morality of vaccines rather than the reality. The reality is no one wants the shitty third options that may or may not kill you no matter how small the chance in an oversaturated marketplace.

I'm from Indiana, dude, I've witnessed first hand how minor public perception of products affects Eli Lilly's stock price. If you work there and haven't seen that, you probably shouldn't be hanging around a subreddit whose sole purpose is discussing business and investment.

You're way too invested in the scientific discussion of this rather than the business discussion which is.... kind of the entire point of this subreddit. There are 50 other subreddits you could go discuss the science of this, don't come in the one discussing the business of it and then whine when someone's discussion is about public perception and how that affects revenue."
2021-04-13 09:18:24,wallstreetbets,"Right, it's a problem with causation and correlation.  In reality, the data would actually support the idea that the vaccine leads to a reduction in blood clots, since the percentage of people who have them after the vaccine is lower than the general populace overall.  However, that too would be an unreachable conclusion given the short-term results we have.  I don't disagree that there should careful review of the data, but when a literal handful of people out of thousands and thousands that received a shot show blood clots, you shouldn't be publishing scary headlines implying that the vaccine isn't safe."

They will say its only a few people...ok but why are we rushing and creating false panic over being able to get a vax? it seems their strategy is to create false panic/fomo vax shots
2021-04-13 17:50:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah dude if I’m in a low risk category for COVID and a vaccine that is not FDA approved has unusual side effects then I’m not taking it. Wait for them to study everything and determine if there will be effects 5, 10, 15 years down the line.

If I were were old, fat, or had chronic respiratory illness then things would be different. But I don’t."
2021-04-13 18:37:16,wallstreetbets,"Variants.  The pool of people who don't get vaccinated provide an opportunity for mutations.  In fact we already got a longer-lasting, more contagious variant, but because the current vaccines seem to work on that everyone already forgot.

  Worst case scenario, if a variant comes along that is immune to the vaccines, its full-on pandemic 2.0.  COVID has basically launched a whole sub-family of coronaviruses into the human virus pool, we aren't adapted, and we only have a few vaccines for this group.  This stuff is complicated and no one learns virology in school even tho its more useful than calculus."

You realize either way you're gambling right? Getting the vaccine you're gambling with incredibly good odds that you'll be totally fine, with a tiny chance of developing more serious complications. Without the vaccine you get to gamble every time you leave your house.

Don't compare trying to save millions of lives to the Nazi regime, that's incredibly insensitive, considering the motive here is to protect millions of lives, rather than exterminate them.

No one's coming for your freedoms you nut job, they're trying to save millions more people from dying."

Any virus actively propagating will mutate at a rate dependent upon a number of conditions, so the more it spread the more it will mutate.  In other words it does not mutate when dormant.

Bottom line: this is a blip for J&J and it is not an issue with their vaccine."

It really is just the perfect ruse they have going. All the vaccinated people are going to get sick as fuck and they'll just be able to blame it on a new ""variant"". Shit is comical. God bless if you're planning on getting it or have already, truly wish you the best. There's really no point in doing so.

My only question, and this one fascinates me...will those who got the shot, after getting sick, finally wake the fuck up as to what is happening? Or will they just keep doubling down and go with the msm narrative with the variants?"

It's really not that hard of a concept. The entire point of this subreddit This isn't a place to discuss the science of it. I responded to your comment because it was, ""who cares."" The people who get the vaccine care, which is why this is a shit stock to buy right now going into an already shaky earnings call.

Fuck back off to /r/science if you want to discuss that other bullshit. This isn't a place for it. Unless you have some kind of insight into how the agenda you're trying to push connects to the stock price of the company, it literally just doesn't belong here.

As to the rest of that bullshit, I'm not even going to argue it. I don't care to discuss which vaccine is the safest just because you have whatever agenda to do so."

During that time if you were not a first responder the only people eligible in my state would have been 60-65+ which was recently relaxed some.

The article came up when I was scrolling and simply saw it as an absurd overreaction by the FDA to pause the vaccine based on 6 reactions, without knowing the medical history of the women, out of 6.8 million doses. My “who cares” was like who honestly cares that there have been six of these episodes out of so many doses... it was not a “who cares” about this in regards to stock. It was just a reaction to the FDA’s overeaction. I don’t get how you don’t comprehend this, but please be sure to comment on the 100’s of other people that said similar things about the FDA’s overeaction and make sure you yell at them and tell them this is an investing subreddit.

In a way, they are all related, especially in the modern world where if you don’t understand what is happening inside of the magic box, be it a computer program, equation, or environmental system, you aren’t going to be able to question in a detailed, technical way. How can you question the stats used in a news story if you don’t have some understanding of basic stats? 

Gas pedal makes car go vs.  gas pedal allows more fuel/air to reach engine which releases the energy stored in the chemical bonds of the fuel which is converted to a mechanical force transferred to the wheels...I mean you can break that down even further, with a more intricate explanation of both the parts of the car and the physics/chemistry involved."

Edit: Due to the amount of interest this has gained, I think that for efficiency sake, I’m going to need you apes to line up tip-to-tip. 

DD: Although potentially decreasing the fraction of stimulation per jerk in the spatial dimension, I still assume that I’ll be able to grasp each shaft. Doubling the number of thread members being stimulated simultaneously is hence assumed to be more efficient by approximately a factor of two.

In conclusion, I’ve found that of the strategies evaluated and given reasonable assumptions and parameters, tip-to-tip strategy, which is twice as efficient as single jerk will be the most effective approach in getting through all apes as efficiently and satisfactorily as possible, so that this thing can 🚀

Its on youtube still though and starts at about 17 minutes in.""Gamestop went through as everybody's knows... a really interesting iteration. Its brand is a result of what occurred over the last 5 months is worldwide. The IP of gamestop, its actual brand itself, is way more valued today than it had 5 months ago before it came apart of every headline around the world day after day. As the vigilantes or the reddit crowd or the robinhood crowd or whatever you want to call it, the democratization of stock trading. So you recently saw they are going up to raise captial... the analogy is netflix i guess. Saw the writing on t he wall when they were mailing CDs to everybody and said were going to digitize this and they had a brand. Maybe GME can do this same thing. Maybe they can provide added services, they have all these retail locations. Maybe they can have you know, classes, in a setting where people want to spend time together in those stores. 1200 SQ FT, 1700 of them. I dont know what the outcome would be, but if I was short that stock I would be worried and im not sure. I think its going to get a second kick at life. I think there are some very smart people that probably see what I see and the IP being worth something. And this whole social constituent use supporting it, the pricing of the stock is kind of irrelevant at this point. But if you are short you are really hurting.""

If you believe in their vision, then there’s no reason to panic.  If you don’t believe in their vision?  Then lick your wounds and reinvest somewhere else.  It’s pretty simple."

When you hear of brokerage firms lending out customers shares for short selling those shares come from margin accounts that have signed an agreement allowing the brokerage firms to do so. Good news is that CashApp Investing does not have traditional margin accounts and we do not lend out customers shares or funds.  
Cash App Investing offers limited purpose margin accounts that do not involve any extension of credit. We do not offer traditional margin accounts at this time.  
If you place a purchase that exceeds your Cash App balance, the remaining funds will be debited from your linked debit card. This means that your buying power is limited to the combined funds available in your Cash App account balance and bank account. 

Keep in mind, purchases made using a debit card are subject to your account’s Add Cash limits. To view your Add Cash limits: 
1.  Tap the Banking tab on your Cash App home screen
2.  Select Limits. If you do not see ""Limits"", select Deposits & Transfers and scroll down to Cash Limits.

Please let me know if you have any other questions, I am always happy to help.

2021-04-13 07:43:46,wallstreetbets,"Cohen will likely not take the CEO spot, rather, he’ll bring in someone with a large amount of digital and e-commerce experience while maintaining the chairman seat. Reasons I love GameStop right now aside from the squeeze:

PR - most investing in GameStop are gamers or know gamers in their circle. They understand the massive potential in the market that continues to grow at a ridiculous pace. GameStop’s name is everywhere right now and we’ll think (along with many others) to buy from GameStop before we look elsewhere.

Experience - the executive team is now littered with some of the brightest in the business. Their focus? THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. They’re not just selling a GPU or a Keyboard - they’re selling the experience that comes with it and that means repeat customers, strong advocacy, and a lower cost for things such as customer acquisition (marketing, PR, etc.) See Cohen’s recent Tweet or the story about the Customer Support issue to see just how laser-focused this is. He’s learning the company bottom up as well as top down.

Apes - we’re conditioned to perform under pressure. We’ve been playing games since we were  in diapers and can understand the need to hold tight and wait for the right moment. We won’t be shaken, we won’t be defeated, and we’ll keep coming back - all the while enjoying the ride. That’s some good shit right there.

Red or Green I don’t give a fuck. Power to the Players."

GME went from 141 -> 132 -> 142.

This is not a normal stock. This is fully manipulated and apes are just riding the long whales in a fight. Of course we own the float, but without long whale power there isn't much preventing shorts driving it back to $40.

Long whales said \~145 for no options gain (bad for options holders, mainly the shorts).  
Long whales completely control this at this point. Just waiting for the timing (dtcc rules etc). Hold your pants/dresses, rockets take time."

I love the DFV stolen base gif...some context:

Boston and New York have one of the most bitter rivalries in American sports but New York had dominated the rivalry ever since Boston traded Babe Ruth to them in 1918 which created ""The Curse of the Bambino."" The Yankees are one of the most successful sports franchises in the world and are often referred to as the ""Evil Empire."" They often use their obscenely large payroll to just buy the best players which led to a lot of winning and Boston could never seem to shake them.

Finally in 2004, the two teams met in a best-of-7 series in what is essentially the semi-finals for pro baseball. The Yankees had a 3 games to none lead and no team had ever come back from such a deficit in MLB history. The Yankees had a 4-3 lead going into the final inning of the fourth and potentially final game of the series with one of the greatest pitchers of all time, Mariano Rivera in to close out the game. A runner was able to make it on base and a faster runner was  subsequently subbed in, presumably to try to steal a base. Everyone knew exactly what he was planning to do and if he failed that would have been a huge blow to Boston's chances. But it ended up paying off as the next batter was able to get him home with a single and tie the game. This stolen base is seen as a turning point as Boston went on the win that game and the next three, winning the series and allowing them to go on to win their first World Series in 86 years.

So...
Yankees = Hedge funds

Boston = Apes

Just like everyone knew Dave Roberts would try to steal that base, everyone knows the apes' strategy (buy and hold). It's risky to put so much on the line versus a powerful opponent, but it's the risk that must be taken in order to come out victorious. Hopefully we are seeing a similar turning point as that stolen base represents."

2021-04-13 09:24:22,wallstreetbets,"If you’re panicking right now think about why you bought in in the first place. You did your research, right? You read as many DDs as possible, right? You only invested money you were okay with losing, right?

If you invested in GME you should have answered yes to all those questions. You already should have known this was going to be a bumpy ride when you initially invested and the current state of GME is the result of this volatility. The research hasn’t changed, you can go back and look through this sub for some DDs if you’re worried. Nothing has changed, all of that research is the same today as it was when you invested. 

If you are panic selling now, or even just thinking about it, it means you were not responsible enough to do your research before buying in. Sorry to say, but you probably shouldn’t have invested in GME, or really anything. 

Apes don’t panic when the stock acts exactly as expected. The stock is acting exactly as expected. We aren’t panicking. Are you?"

Green bars with a line below and nothing above usually means a red bar is following. 

When the rocket is taking off, you’ll see green with no lines below one after another. Until then, calm your tits.

Where shitadel can allow a controlled squeeze to happen in hopes of tricking Apes to sell at double their investment. This would help shitadel buy back shares while minimizing their loss. It would also release pressure from the real MOASS keeping it from reaching its full potential and in turn making the controlled squeeze the real squeeze and fucking us 🦧.

2021-04-13 10:00:04,wallstreetbets,"In 1964, a stock displayed previously unprecedented market behavior. It was one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market at that time and due to a unique combination of investors buying an unusual amout and the company itself restructuring, it resulted in massive up-and-down swings of the stock in a way that hadnt really been seen before this way. It went from around 15$ to 600$ within two weeks and became popular among amateur investors. Lots of people bought in and when the stock tanked awhile later down to around 30$, a sizable amout of people panic sold. A week later the stock went up to 2400$ for several days and then settled around the 200$ range after that. Several people who sold during the initial crash would later call it the greatest mistake of their life and among the involved people, a correlation in the following 20 years between suicides and the people who sold the stock at a low prize point has been suggested. That stocks name? Albert Einstein.

When asked why you hold and if it's with the anticipation that the stock will go back up, he responded in an email, ""You certainly hope it goes back up. But stocks don't always move on the timetable you want. Like I said in the ama, if the reason for your purchase is still valid, why would you sell if you can afford to hold it?"" Mark Cuban

Thank you apes for believing in us and holding. We like the stock, and we are in this together. 💎🤚🚀"

ONE DAY CLOSER TO THE MOON APES! 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Make sure to retweet the Better Markets tweet about Shitadel's criminal activity:

https://twitter.com/BetterMarkets/status/1381746776206680068?s=19

THE PRICE IS WRONG! LITERALLY. Sell orders go on the open market while buy orders are routed to dark pools in order to suppress buying pressure.

RETAIL IS WINNING, HANG IN THERE.

Apes are buying en masse. Don't panic sell, it will be the biggest regret of your life."

2021-04-13 15:37:48,wallstreetbets,"Another hypothetical for you apes.

Let's say you hold 1000 shares and the price goes up by $0.10 today. Darn! Only $100 on the day.

Let's say you're shorting the stock and you have invested all you have into making sure the price stays down. A $0.10 increase day seems like nothing to share holders, but factor in interest rates, having to cover positions and calls, and the many short positions and you have a loss that amounts to a couple million dollars. 

This is happening EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. 

Price goes up lightly or bigly = HF lose the day 

Price goes down a little = HF lose the day

Price stays at anything above $1 = HF still have to cover their short positions

IN THE END IT DOESN'T MATTER! Day by DAY APES are helping these funds bleed out with speed!"

Anyway... I'm holding. The market is overvalued in the equity premium risk is retarded.But GME has decent potential to become a nice dividend stonk. ;p

Edit: almost every day the same pattern. The first minutes before and after market opening theŷ leave the price on green so that a retarded ape could think “yeahhhh today’s the day” and invests all he has. It’s like a fishing lure for retards. But we can break this pattern if we persist and at least act intelligent.🦍💎

Luckily, this band of apes are weaponized nihilists who don’t fear financial ruin. They fear missing the opportunity to exit this rigid caste system. They fear the rocket launching without them.

Its on youtube still though and starts at about 17 minutes in.""Gamestop went through as everybody's knows... a really interesting iteration. Its brand is a result of what occured over the last 5 months is worldwide. The IP of gamestop, its actual brand itself, is way more valued today than it had 5 months ago before it came apart of every headline around the world day after day. As the vigilantes or the reddit crowd or the robinhood crowd or whatever you want to call it, the democratization of stock trading. So you recently saw they are going up to raise captial... the analogy is netflix i guess. Saw the writing ont he wall when they were mailing CDs to everybody and said were goign to digitize this and they had a brand. Maybe GME can do this same thing. Maybe they can provide added services, they have all these retail locations. Maybe they can have you know, classes, in a setting where people want to spend time together in those stores. 1200 SQ FT, 1700 of them. I dont know what the outcome would be, but if I was short that stock I would be worried and im not sure. I think its going to get a second kick at life. I think there are some very smart people that probably see what I see and the IP being worth something. And this whole social constituent use supporting it, the pricing of the stock is kind of irrelevant at this point. But if you are short you are really hurting."""

I  just received a 200+page booklet in the mail as a TLRY/APHA shareholder  and thought I'd share some of the information with you guys.

\- The Aphria live audio meeting will take place on April 14th at 4:00pm EST at [www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021)

\- The Tilray meeting will take place on April 16th at 11:00am EST at [www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TLRY2021SM](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TLRY2021SM)

\-  shareholders of APHA will receive 0.8381 of a share of TLRY at the  merger (I wonder why Tilray's trading lower than Aphria right now? *edit:  oh, my broker shows tilray in USD but aphria in CAD so it's confusing,  they're trading at roughly .833 difference which is normal*)

\-  the two companies combined will create the world's largest global  cannabis company, with pro forma revenue of US$685m (C$874m) for the  last 12 mo. prior to the Dec.16/20 merger announcement.

\-  shareholders will vote on approvals for Tilray's charter amendment,  share issuance, advisory compensation, and adjournment proposals to  revise them;

\- increase the authorized capital stock of TLRY from 743,333,333 shares to 900,000,000 (890m class 2 common, 10m preferred)

There's  a lot of information to pore over in the booklet, these are just some  quick points. I am not a financial advisor, use this information at your  own peril."

 I am an ultimate retard who didn't take any of that 120 when I had it and put it away in anything safe.  I thought no way ALL of my tech positions can be bad, and after going to about 50k in March from 120k just made a bunch of really stupid emotional ""oh no I need to make it back quick"" option plays.    


Since then every second of every day all I think about is the money I lost and I feel desperate to make it back.   I basically get home from work and just sleep because I want to ignore the reality of what I did.  


Don't be me.  Take some of your profits and go with a good index or just put it in your bank."

Also, oil contributed worse than expected inflation and I believe it further confirms the Fed's stand that the inflation is more transitory than permanent.

2021-04-13 07:34:24,wallstreetbets,"For the smooth brains out there, it’s not the blood clotting that’s a big deal. It’s the FDA and CDC calling for a pause in administration of the JNJ vaccine. Also, it’s not how that impacts JNJ stock but rather vaccine roll out and hesitancy that’s concerning. Particularly for rural and poor areas that don’t have the refrigeration needed for the mRNA vaccine. It could slow down the “great reopening” which is priced for perfection."

Biontech uses the same technology as MRNA. J&J, Pfizer and other drug companies have run the world and governments for years and they didn’t want a new player in the game. Unfortunately for them MRNA and Biontech have the only cure. Pfizer got smart and partnered with Biontech because they have the means to run a full trial, that is the only reason they were first to market. As far as J&J let’s not forget how many people developed cancer over baby powder. They were a corrupt company and always will put profit over people."

2021-04-13 07:06:11,wallstreetbets,"Futures are flat as of 0630. This follows a blah day Monday when not much happened. That is all due to change with the Consumer Price Index reports for March, due out at 0830.

Expectations are for a 2.5% YoY print, up over 1.7% in February. The MoM number is anticipated at 0.5% (0.4% in Feb). This is a big data release because inflation, more than anything, is what will force the Fed to tighten interest rates. Once that happens it puts the Bull Market on borrowed time and eventually starts a Bear Market. That, at least, has been the pattern.

Powell and Co. have been making the rounds preemptively talking down inflation concerns. They’re saying any spike in inflation is due to be ‘transitory.’ Ultimately none of that may matter. Transitory or not, higher consumer prices (and higher markets, though they would never admit it) will force the Fed’s hand. So that’s why this is so important.

A good gauge of the market’s expectation of Fed policy is the Fed futures contract from CME Group. That and 5-year Treasury yields, which have been moving steadily higher. But that’s just the market expectations. The CPI print is what will move that. And if that number beats to the upside there is sure to be something resembling fear. That means selling of risk assets, like stocks.

Watch energy markets too. There are many factors affecting energy prices but inflation is one. To wit, crude is up about 1% this morning."

Still, it's another huge win for the mRNA team. The victory lap will come when an update due to mutants is needed, mRNA development time for that is about 2 days, and a fast approval has already been promised.

2021-04-13 17:11:23,wallstreetbets,"Everything is priced in.

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe. So please, before you make a post asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb question again."

# FAQ
 
## What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."

2021-04-13 11:29:12,wallstreetbets,"Like our boy said earlier, you have to be certain you can take care of the dog and it can be dangerous to get a pet with the pure intentions of it rescuing your mental health.

However, I have found that having a pet in my life cuts down on my loneliness. I have been more comfortable and confident when I’ve lived with dogs, and they give you a reason to take walks and get sunshine which is good too. They can be really, really great friends.

But they will not make it so you don’t miss people anymore. That will still be there. It doesn’t fix the person deficit, but it does add a dog bonus, which makes it more bearable, if you follow."

Did you just think that you could fucking fool me with that comment of yours? I've searched your name up in the Navy SEAL database and you have never even graduated BUD/S, hell, even served in the Armed Forces. If you were actually a Navy SEAL, then you actually know how to spell guerrilla, you fucking moron. And you say you are the top sniper in the entire US Armed Forces and have over 300 confirmed kills. If that were true, then why the fuck is Chris Kyle a household name and you aren't? And plus he only had 160 kills. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. Plus why the fuck would you say you have a secret network of spies yet you just revealed that you had your secret network of spies? Are you a fucking idiot? If you can kill someone seven-hundred different ways, then list them all, I bet you can't even come up with seven. And if you had access to the entire US Marine Corps arsenal, then why the fuck did you just say you were in the Navy SEALs earlier? If only you could have done your research prior to posting your little “clever” comment, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you goddamn idiot."

2021-04-13 15:40:36,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha. I don’t know anything about that, but it sounds like you do. 

What I can tell you is that you need to do a SHIT TON of DD. 

You have to know, your competitors, their costs and profitability. Costs of everything you need annually. Risks. What happens if your supplier dries up. What stops someone else from doing what you are doing or undercutting you. 

And if your plan is expansion, who is gonna help you with that, what’s your experience growing a business and managing people. Have you ever done payroll, biz taxes and how do you plan to accommodate all of your employees needs to your local tax codes and employment laws. What benefits do you plan to offer and who will be your handling HR needs.  Etc, etc. 

There’s a lot that goes into it. A solid biz plan should take a minimum of a few months of research and planning before presenting anything to a bank or professional investor. 

The main thing you have is that you already know the industry and the product you are selling is you. But you gotta know every little aspect of what can possibly go wrong and have a plan to overcome those objections and their biggest interest is going to be that you can speak to that and have a solid plan to return their money over all things in good or bad times. 

You should Mos Def go after it bro!"

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I think $VIAC is a buy right now *This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I have never worked in finance in any capacity.*

Viacom CBS is one of the biggest mass media conglomerates in the world. It was formed after the merger of CBS and Viacom in 2019. It owns Paramount pictures, manages over 170 networks, such as Nickelodeon and Comedy Central and has begun a move towards online streaming with youtube channels and its Paramount Plus streaming service.

**Why $VIAC's price is so low right now**

In the past month, $VIAC has crashed over 56.33%. For those who aren’t aware, this decrease was caused by 3 factors :

* Viacom announced a 3 billion dollar stock sale causing a 23.2% crash
* Investors downgraded Viacom’s stock
* Archegos Capital Management was forced to liquidate its position in Viacom CBS, causing an additional 27% plunge in the price of VIAC [\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archegos_Capital_Management#cite_note-jcwsj-6)

**Why do I think $VIAC is a buy**

There are several reasons why Viacom CBS is a buy. Firstly, its heavily discounted because of the sudden crash and so may have a short term momentum reversal to restore its price to normal:

* The P/E ratio of $VIAC is at a very low 10.66
* According to Yahoo Finance, the average analyst price target for $VIAC is $54.65, while the price of $VIAC is currently only $39.77

Secondly, the company has been performing solidly on fundamentals:

* Viacom CBS’s earnings have experienced steady growth in 2020, from $516M in Q1 to $810M in Q4
* Viacom CBS increased operating cash flow from $1171M in 2019 to $2215M in 2020
* In a digital era, Viacom CBS has also been moving in the right direction with its online streaming services, it gained 30M new global streaming subscribers last year and Global streaming & digital video revenue increased 71% year-over-year to $888M
* In Q4, CBS was the most-watched network in Daytime and Late Night and claimed the quarter’s top drama, news magazine and 4 of the top 5 comedies, as well as the top new comedy series

On the negative side, it must be noted that $VIAC's short interest is 18%, meaning it would take shorts 2 days to cover (source: [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=viac&submit=Short+Quote](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=viac&submit=Short+Quote)), so there is a fair amount of negative sentiment. 

TLDR :

$VIAC is a strong company at a crazy discount. $VIAC TO THE MOON"

They have Pluto TV, 11 year exclusive contract with the NFL, US rights taken from ESPN to air UAFE soccer for live streaming (I know soccer), they own MTV who just announced a partnership with Pepsi for a new dating show (not my thing but it is for plenty of others, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, and obviously CBS. They have movie rights to the mission impossible movies and the Star Trek franchise and others that I don’t know off the top of my head. Pluto TV 30m monthly users that use the service free and is supported by ad revenue. Paramount+ has two level support entry with 6.99 for full access with adds or 9.99 without. Which is cheaper than everyone out there with a larger original and purchased catalog than most other services. For either level you get live TV that includes CBS, CBSN, CBS sports, and ET live. CBS has been the top rated network for 17 of the last 18 years. They own their own studios so making new content is easier than Netflix or Amazon. They are expanding into Latin America by acquiring Chilevision from ATT which is a free to air network that had 22% of all viewership in 2020. Good P/E. Dividends....positive revenue....the short play is timing the options right, which I have failed, still have a few out that might print. Other than that decades old proven company with solid fundamentals with an average PT 50% higher than current price. It’s a safe play for retirement funds....and here’s hoping that today is the day it goes up. Right now it’s up 1.30 and holding which is better than it has been doing for the past week.

Oh yah and earnings report out on May 6th and they aired the Super Bowel with all that ad revenue $$$"
2021-04-13 04:57:11,wallstreetbets,">Archegos Capital Management was forced to liquidate its position in Viacom CBS, causing an additional 27% plunge in the price of VIAC

Archegos used 5x leverage that propped VIAC. He went from 1 bank, bought a bunch of bananas that caused the price of bananas to go up. Hwang being a brilliant kind of ape, went to a second bank and did the same thing. He repeated the process 5x on half a dozen banana brands driving up the share price of all his bananas. Hwang did this through a shady practice with banks call TRS (total return swaps). TRS is kinda like the same kind of dirty bank deals that brought down the mortgage system in '08.

The important takeaway to keep in mind is the TRS. Hwang didn't technically own the bananas, the banks did and their dumb asses are sweeping it under the rug, waiting for another Archegos."
2021-04-13 09:02:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm a simple idiot, but I think it is a good long term buy just based on the 5 year graph...  Lots of stocks at all time highs with insane P/E ratios, but VIAC is down from where it was even in Dec 2019 with a non-crazy P/E ratio.  Also they are moving towards streaming services as they should be.

It will probably get driven a bit lower first bc of the reasons mentioned, but I agree it is a buy."
2021-04-13 10:03:25,wallstreetbets,"What's up thinking streaming is an automatic success? 
It's their second one after failing at cbs all access and they rushed the relaunch so they are out there without a flagship show, identity, or something to set it apart from the prior.

CBS all access was just... CBS only but in an app, not very interesting. This one has more potential.

Whether or not Viacom will actually be able to make a good product im not sure though.

The company is trading right now on fundamentals like a value stock at these prices, even a bit on the low side really indicating it is oversold in my opinion. Then with paramount+ there is a little bit of good growth potential, so thats why I think the stock is good at this price.

I don't really think its a great WSB stock though more of a good buy at these prices for a longer hold than a buy options type of thing."

2021-04-13 07:18:41,wallstreetbets,I remember a solid 3:1 music video to non music programming ratio in the early 90s. Viacom totally fucked up a good thing imo.
2021-04-13 10:08:48,wallstreetbets,"And he has really turned his life around since jackass. He does a lot of stuff on YouTube, been sober for years. Even has a video of him reacting to all his ""geeked out"" clips and you can tell he finds it all very cringe.  Props to the dude.

Now he just needs to help bam out."
2021-04-13 04:00:12,wallstreetbets,Seems like it’s just the tip of the iceberg compared to social media.
2021-04-13 04:04:59,wallstreetbets,"In the context of Viacom, that's why i won't be investing in them because of CBS, MTV, VH1, Nickalodean."

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Some may call me the Diamond-Handed Dumbass $20k gains -> $0. When they shut off buying shares I rolled my 1/29c gains into 2/5c's and watched it disappear 
2021-04-13 01:18:29,wallstreetbets,thats tuition for an options trading live course
2021-04-13 01:22:30,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much the same happened to me.
Glad to see I’m not the only one, it was a lot of money for me too. Saw my account hit 40k then watched it all burn."
2021-04-13 01:15:32,wallstreetbets,Ouch. Would you like a ghost pepper to go with that?

2021-04-13 03:00:40,wallstreetbets,The real pain is watching it go up and down and not knowing if your screwing yourself by selling early or screwing yourself by selling too late

2021-04-13 02:12:03,wallstreetbets,Luckily it was only gains that were lost when the 1/29 200c's went up 100x. Staying away from GME options and just keeping my shares on Fidelity going forward
2021-04-13 05:47:04,wallstreetbets,The contracts he paid 20k for expired worthless? You pay for the contract + premium

2021-04-13 05:27:47,wallstreetbets,I have plenty of shares. Robinhood turned off buying more shares so my only choice was another contract since I was above their limits for all the restricted days. Currently only buying shares. That was going to be rolled into shares but Vlad cucked us

2021-04-13 06:31:27,wallstreetbets,GME is the greatest game at the casino right now.... if you don't understand that this is the only game where talk of shares are acceptable you're not understanding the game.
2021-04-13 16:11:41,wallstreetbets,"So you bought call contract when knowing people can't buy shares?

You belong here."

2021-04-13 10:37:58,wallstreetbets,Options are designed to enhance the yield of long term accounts of major stock holders while either allowing them to keep their shares or sell them at a premium that is worth it to THEM. There are disciplines that might allow traders to exploit inefficiencies and technical moves. Generally these are mounted cavalry strategies- not artillery or infantry tactics. Sometimes the infantry can win but their losses pale against their risks of annihilation. Sorry for you loss.
2021-04-13 10:39:44,wallstreetbets,That’s certainly retarded.

This makes me so sick to see how many ppl are reeled into this stupid GME frenzy, and have no fucking clue. $86k, guaranteed to be 0% the instant he purchased it. It doesn't have to be this way you apes."

2021-04-13 12:14:46,wallstreetbets,"Sell that contract while you can, and save those $300

You can buy 2 shares of GME with that...

2021-04-13 02:57:06,wallstreetbets,"If I have 86k, I would spend it all on drugs and women and then yolo on call options. This guy maybe yolo on call options first before going with drugs and women"
2021-04-13 02:47:55,wallstreetbets,"I haven't seen the rates lately, but I feel like that's gotta be cheaper than whatever Reddit's version of a frontpage takeover ad is these days."
2021-04-13 02:51:36,wallstreetbets,"Who knows, maybe twice? I’m rooting for the apes!"
2021-04-13 03:24:29,wallstreetbets,And to make the squeeze less likely by sponsoring the enemy.
2021-04-13 05:43:26,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand why people do this. Is this photo shop bs or are people really just throwing money away?
2021-04-13 06:30:33,wallstreetbets,"You can always make more money, you're only allowed on the front page once."
2021-04-13 07:18:14,wallstreetbets,Shit like this ain't helping the squeeze.
2021-04-13 16:08:55,wallstreetbets,Breakeven $572.80 LOL honestly might as well just sell for that $315
2021-04-13 08:19:10,wallstreetbets,It’s Jason Bourne
2021-04-13 05:14:53,wallstreetbets,"$17,200 per contract. He literally could have just bought 100 (or more) shares and profited exactly the same. Literally... He paid the price of 100 shares for the ability to buy those 100 shares later at a higher price..."
2021-04-13 03:01:10,wallstreetbets,Some have referred to these actions as “Retarded”
2021-04-13 04:37:52,wallstreetbets,The dumbest thing you’ve ever seen so far.
2021-04-13 03:05:26,wallstreetbets,What exactly does this mean? I’m actually retarded
2021-04-13 03:10:40,wallstreetbets,"At what point was it possible to buy an option contract for $17,280 with a $572 break even?  Is this fake?"
2021-04-13 08:46:54,wallstreetbets,This isn’t called a YOLO. This is called not knowing how options work.
2021-04-13 09:35:03,wallstreetbets,"I've still yet to buy an option contract, but this is the most retarded shit I've seen here. It took me a while to even figure out what I was looking at, because paying a $172 premium was outside the realm of retardation that I thought was even possible, and holding this long? Magical."
2021-04-13 09:54:02,wallstreetbets,He could have gotten a finance degree and learned how options work for less money than this.

2021-04-13 08:04:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah.  This was the trade that make people think they are geniuses when it plays out the .01% of the time.  Other idiots were clearly buying these if the price was THAT high.
2021-04-13 12:23:17,wallstreetbets,"Ape here who doesn’t totally understand options; was he basically betting that GME would be well above $172, which would make exercising the options on Friday profitable?"
2021-04-13 05:08:45,wallstreetbets,"Yup, I was planning to buy some calls. I am now rethinking that plan."
2021-04-13 02:46:13,wallstreetbets,Same 😳

2021-04-13 05:34:13,wallstreetbets,"No, I don't think you would have.   This guy payed $172 *per share* for the right to buy 500 of them by 4/16.  Really ask yourself if you'd pay somebody $172 per share, and you don't even get to have any shares.  Just the *possibility* of maybe buying the shares in the short term future."
2021-04-13 07:45:00,wallstreetbets,The op is different? How do you know?

2021-04-13 08:01:04,wallstreetbets,The posts are by a different guy though my bro
2021-04-13 04:04:53,wallstreetbets,Because people see how much more potential there is for options. My friend made $1m with options on a GME play the first time around.
2021-04-13 15:54:18,wallstreetbets,Because you can make a lot more with options? What kind of dumb ass question is this? Did you forget what sub you're in?

2021-04-13 05:04:06,wallstreetbets,He already paid the 86k to purchase the options but they are going to expire worthless so he can't sell them for shit.

2021-04-13 01:02:30,wallstreetbets,He should've put that money into something other than fucking gme.
2021-04-13 02:48:28,wallstreetbets,"It will, it's going to squeeze on starting wed and it will all be over by lunch on Friday and he will be able to post again and laugh at everyone that laughed at his loss, he will have the last laugh."

2021-04-13 13:08:24,wallstreetbets,"THIS!

He would only be out his initial investment AKA the premium cost of the calls themselves, not what having those shares would be, right??? He could just let them expire and only lose the premium he invested, not 86k, right?"

2021-04-13 04:26:23,wallstreetbets,"Well if he sells it again after buying back in those losses come back into play though correct? Since it’s added to the cost basis, if I’m not mistaking"
2021-04-13 05:45:49,wallstreetbets,With what?
2021-04-13 11:01:30,wallstreetbets,Sheesh
2021-04-13 13:14:12,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure about the implications of carrying a loss forward but I was looking into wash sales recently and learned some things.

1.) Different strikes / prices don't count toward wash sale losses that are disallowed. They are treated as a different security.

2.) When you have wash sale losses that are disallowed you don't entirely lose the ability to claim that loss against other earnings. The wash sale loss gets added to your cost basis so in the end your tax burden will in fact only be based on your net gains.

3.)And this is the sweeeeeetest part about it. If you are say swing trading a particular stock and keep buying and selling buying and selling etc for over a year, each time you do a wash sale the time period you held it for gets added to your total holding time. This means that if you swing trade say, AMD all year long, by the time you pass a year of doing this your trades will now be taxed at long term capital gains instead of short term gapital gains. Once again this is ONLY if the securities are the same. So like, JUST AMD stock, or JUST one exact long term option.

Here's a ton more info:

https://www.tradelogsoftware.com/resources/wash-sales/

I got scared AF when I saw an article about some guy who apparently made 40k on trades but owed 800k in taxes and looked into it and apparently that article was just completely wrong. I looked at my OWN statement from last year(my first year of trading) and I had 14k in wash sales on 900k in volume. My net losses per the app were about $4500 and even though I had 14k in wash sales my actual net profit / loss for last year was -4500. If the wash sales would have been fucking me I would have shown a 16k profit and had to pay taxes on that 16k."
2021-04-13 08:38:31,wallstreetbets,"if you have time and care to explain this more to me, i would really appreciate it. even if it’s just clarifying if this rule only applies to calls, or it is for all forms of trades."
2021-04-13 04:58:23,wallstreetbets,"Correct, with so much loss, you can roll it over for 30 years at 3k/year, or offset any new gain with the remaining carryover"
2021-04-13 09:08:40,wallstreetbets,"~~It appears you are correct. F for OP.~~

Edit: person below me is right cast me into the pit

>~~A net capital loss is carried back 3 years and forward up to 5 years as a short-term capital loss.~~  
>  
>Net capital losses in excess of $3,000 can be carried forward indefinitely until the amount is exhausted.

2021-04-13 08:11:18,wallstreetbets,Makes you wonder what OP thought he was doing
2021-04-13 07:49:39,wallstreetbets,But I thought more risk == more tendies
2021-04-13 09:30:10,wallstreetbets,AND he could have sold covered calls. Fuck even if he sold leaps he could have made 20k+ and just left the stock alone and never have to look at it again lmao
2021-04-13 07:55:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but if GME goes to ten trillion per share, he’ll make out pretty well!! 😂😂😂"
2021-04-13 12:13:20,wallstreetbets,500 shares... he has 5 contracts.
2021-04-13 14:35:58,wallstreetbets,"How is this even possible? Was the IV really this high at some point to get call prices to ~$170? The most ITM, longest dated option for GME ($2 Jan 2023 C) is only $141.00 right now, and the OP must have been buying a much shorter expiry that is much more OTM, effectively perfectly timing the tops in price AND in IV AND in bid/ask spread in order to get to that purchase price.

If I specifically sat down today to lose money, I don't think I could have bought something as retarded as this."
2021-04-13 07:56:04,wallstreetbets,He went FULL retard
2021-04-13 08:07:37,wallstreetbets,Wow. Just wow
2021-04-13 08:11:09,wallstreetbets,You have drove the message home sir. Splendid synopsis
2021-04-13 10:44:47,wallstreetbets,Hmm maybe I’m missing it but I’m assuming he bought these when GME price was way higher otherwise the premium wouldn’t be this high
2021-04-13 09:51:21,wallstreetbets,I truly believe this might be the dumbest thing that will happen on WSB for as long as this sub remains active.
2021-04-13 11:03:10,wallstreetbets,Gleeeeesh
2021-04-13 11:53:35,wallstreetbets,Dat IV.  Gotta do the math before buying.  Lessons were hopefully learned.  Most people who've played with options have probably been burned by this at one point or another.
2021-04-13 13:41:14,wallstreetbets,Jesus when you say it like that it’s truly an amazingly retarded scenario. Like full stop. STOP.
2021-04-13 18:08:22,wallstreetbets,Options are fucking magic! Amazing!
2021-04-13 19:02:23,wallstreetbets,Pro tip: do some basic research into options before dumping $90k into 100% OTM calls that cost the same as 100 shares.
2021-04-13 10:38:29,wallstreetbets,"Pack it up.  We hit full retard.  I can't even design a scenario in my brain that would be worse than this.  This is the lowest bar on retard, everything from here on should compare to this."

2021-04-13 03:14:05,wallstreetbets,"The premium OP paid was 172.80 per contract (for 5 options contracts), which is multiplied by 100 since every contract controls 100 shares.

172.80 x 100 x 5 = $86,400

They are now worth .63 premium (per contract):

.63 x 100 x 5 = $315

So yeah, unless the stock sees quick upward momentum this week, OP is out a bunch of money."
2021-04-13 03:12:52,wallstreetbets,Op paid $172 for each of his options that are now worth $.63
2021-04-13 03:52:02,wallstreetbets,You're among friends now
2021-04-13 09:57:04,wallstreetbets,"He paid 173 per share in a bet that they would go above 173 in the next week. If they don't increase past that price he loses everything.

Really, it's even dumber than that. Because of the high premium the stock has to get way over $500 not to lose money on the deal.

He could have just bought the shares and then at least retained whatever their value is once he sells. He basically managed to turn a call into a day higher risk than just buying shares, with no upside."
2021-04-13 04:02:03,wallstreetbets,">At what point was it possible to buy an option contract for $17,280 with a $572 break even? 

It's possible if IV was sky high. OP may have bought several weeks ago."
2021-04-13 06:16:55,wallstreetbets,If you check his history he bought these on Jan 29th which was the extremely volatile day where GME had its second peak.
2021-04-13 04:16:02,wallstreetbets,During the initial squeeze $1200 calls were going for 25k. It was insanity.
2021-04-13 12:39:22,wallstreetbets,"No, he was betting that GME would be 172 above 400, or 572. But that's only breakeven. It's stupid for so many reasons, even if you're bullish on GME."
2021-04-13 05:53:03,wallstreetbets,I bought 170 puts with 5/26 expiration. 🌈bear.

2021-04-13 08:25:10,wallstreetbets,"Don’t forget, when these options expire it’ll be some huge conspiracy by the brokers to take away this guys contracts that he rightfully purchased, and proof it’s going to $1,000,000,000,000 a share."
2021-04-13 02:46:18,wallstreetbets,"Cmon bro, don't kick OP while he's down. He still has a chance. A very very miniscule itsy bitsy chance that GME squeezes tomorrow. Lets root for him instead."

2021-04-13 06:39:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but these options cost him about $170 per share, it literally would have been almost no different to just buy the fucking shares.  

Sure, if the contracts are cheap, like 1-2% of the share price then it can be worth it but when OTM calls are like 90% the price of the underlying for weeklies what are you doing trading options? It’s not a risky move, it’s literally just being a fucktard."
2021-04-13 16:00:49,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you're actually hitting on me right now.

2021-04-13 07:35:37,wallstreetbets,Which is who? If an ape is selling calls against their shares of GME then they are actively driving down the price. So it's likely to assume that the ones writing calls and buying puts are the people NOT on Reddit.

2021-04-13 18:40:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes, 5 contracts = the right to purchase 500 shares.  For that kind of premium it had to be close to the top in January (ie price over 400 with 3 months until expiration) or the break even wouldn’t have been almost $600. If he bought them more recently (ie stock under $200) then that’s even more retarded."

2021-04-13 08:42:21,wallstreetbets,You are guessing
2021-04-13 14:13:28,wallstreetbets,"Unlikely. Retail's leverage from 800c is almost completely gone, and there's only a couple of weeks left of options over 500c. May its down to 430c, which means the higher premiums get them less shares hedged by market makers. Additionally, they're actively fighting the momentum of the millions of shares that market makers are already holding from all of the expired calls over the last month, and which the market makers are steadily selling off to remain delta neutral."
2021-04-13 03:05:48,wallstreetbets,I think the only thing that’s gonna be squeezed here is his arse

2021-04-13 03:07:10,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-13 08:40:59,wallstreetbets,"It just treats it as continuous ownership, so, yes, if he buys back 10 days later but sells again any time before the end of 2021 the loss will still factor into taxes."
2021-04-13 08:31:16,wallstreetbets,"Correct because the loss is carried over to shares you bought within 30 days before or after you sold the same shares at a loss. You are prevented from reporting the loss until you sell the shares the loss was carried over to, unless you wash sale again."
2021-04-13 06:39:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's what I thought too, but I'll admit I don't know shit. I thought the idea for the wash sale rule was so you can't 'double count' your losses, or something along those lines. Since it gets added to the cost basis of the next purchase, to me that logically says you are correct. But please, somebody correct me if I'm wrong, because I actually want to the real answer to this. So the IRS doesn't come take my banana."
2021-04-13 14:57:04,wallstreetbets,"Yes but now imagine doing that with hundreds of trades. You could turn a 1k profit into 100k in tax liability if you end up not exiting the positions before the end of the year.

500 dollar gain, sell. Buy it again. lose 500, sell. Buy it again. repeat. You start racking up those 'wins' but none of the losses because it just keeps getting tacked on to the cost basis. At the end of the year you are holding the stock with a million dollar cost basis but your taxes have 100k in gains on them. Fucking you totally because when you sell the following year you will only be able to write off 3k"
2021-04-13 15:24:43,wallstreetbets,Yeah exactly. It's just so that you can't realize the tax benefits from the loss AND keep the shares. You have to decide between one or the other.
2021-04-13 15:59:53,wallstreetbets,Yes. Wash sale doesn't mean your losses don't count forever... They just don't count if you don't exit the rebought position and stay out of the position for the time required...
2021-04-13 09:55:20,wallstreetbets,Wash sales apply to just about everything (otherwise it'd be easier to dodge taxes). Look up the rules yourself because the thread above has already demonstrated that not a single person here actually understands wash sales.
2021-04-13 06:08:13,wallstreetbets,Do you think somebody who making these losses on GME will ever see gains? please
2021-04-13 06:28:49,wallstreetbets,Could you simplify that for ape brain? If this year I loose 3k next year I don't need to pay taxes?
2021-04-13 07:33:07,wallstreetbets,"> or offset any new gain with the remaining carryover

Nope. Once you carryover you can only use 3k of your accumulated loss. 

If you carryover 50k in losses and end up with 20k in profit next year you can only reduce that to 17k and then continue to carryover 47k to the following year. Cannot reduce profit to 0 and carryover only 30k to the following year.

***nope, i was wrong...see reply"
2021-04-13 12:58:17,wallstreetbets,That's for corporations.

2021-04-13 02:47:12,wallstreetbets,Well rich af is a relative term.  Before this play 87k is quite a bit of money.

2021-04-13 12:41:57,wallstreetbets,"😳... Holy fucking shit lol ☠️ 🪦 

well thanks for clearing that up. So what did it cost him to maintain those options?"

2021-04-13 04:00:26,wallstreetbets,"Hah yeah, no one wins here unless you can sell naked calls."

2021-04-13 13:44:54,wallstreetbets,"Someone said “You can buy 500 shares of GME from me at any point from now until April 16th for $400 per share, no matter what the market price of GME is. However, in order for me to grant you this ability, it’s gonna cost you. The price it will cost is $86,000.”

And OP agreed to those terms, and bought 5 contracts that cost $17,280 each. $86k total.

And now we’re here at a $140 market price on GME. So clearly being able to buy shares at $400/share is a worthless ability, considering you can buy them in the open market for $140, hence why his contracts are worthless. $86k lost from OP, gained by someone else."
2021-04-13 07:46:06,wallstreetbets,How about let’s not? He bought fucking GAMESTOP contracts with a $172.80 premium. That is literally the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. Ever.
2021-04-13 08:17:38,wallstreetbets,"He bought on January 29th, GME hit $325 that day so he probably assumed it would continue skyrocketing and options would net him more profit than outright buying shares, the gamble absolutely did not pay off."

2021-04-13 05:08:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the +5 means he bought 5 call options. So he paid the full amount to open that position in the hope the underlying price of Gamestop would increase and he'd be able to sell his 5 call options at a profit."

2021-04-13 10:10:33,wallstreetbets,If you had shares of GME from last year how could you NOT write against them.  There are definitely Theta Gangers here you just don't hear much from them since the ape takeover.
2021-04-13 10:14:43,wallstreetbets,"Oh, for what it's worth it's likely *most* of the calls bought were sold by market makers. Probably some hedged hedge funds too, its easy money for them, but we definitely saw a delta hedging gamma squeeze on both rounds of GME squeeze - which is *mostly* a market maker phenomenon.

And writing calls itself does not drive down the price of shares at all.  It was call writing that fueled the fire in the first place."

Next year: you start with the remaining loss, -2k. If you have no new gain/loss, then those 2k are deducted from your taxes, same as last year. If you have, let's say 4k gains, then your loss will offset the gains, 4-2=2, you will pay taxes on a capital gain of only 2k."

Implied Volatility is essentially how ""crazy"" the stock price has been in recent history; GME was nuts for a while and continues to be, which means that options contracts are more expensive because of that randomness (higher IV).

&#x200B;

EDIT: Also, time plays a huge part in options pricings as well; a contract 1 week from expiration is much cheaper than a contract that is 1 year away, since the stock has more time to reach the strike price.

If the stock is at $325 the option is worth around ten dollars.

The average cost OP paid for these options is $172.80, so he wants the share price to hit $487.80 by Friday to break even.  Alternatively, he wants the market to expect that to happen and then the option should go to a similar value to what he paid.  In which case I fully expect OP will decide to double down and buy more.

What he owned (the option) is simply a right to buy GME at a certain price, until a certain date.

So if you have an option to buy GME at 170, but it's about to expire and GME is at 150... that's basically worthless because you can just buy GME cheaper on the open market than your option would let you.

Whereas if GME was at say, 300, your option is very valuable, because you can buy shares at 170 and sell them for 300 on market. (You don't actually have to *do* all that buying and selling, it's all baked into the option price)"

Then you have nothing to worry about. The wash sale rule prohibits an investor from claiming a tax deduction for the capital loss on a stock if they sell it and then immediately (within 30 days, before or after) buy back into the position.

An example. 

You bought a 100 shares of $GME at $300 not too long ago, so ($30k). Today you decide to sell at $130 a share, leaving you with $13k and a -$17k capital loss. You could then claim a -$1,500 deduction (the annual max) from your future income when you file for the next dozen years (assuming no other net capital gains/losses).

Hours later you regret your choice and decide to buy back into $GME. So now you have 100 shares again, but also a tax-deductible capital loss. You get a tax benefit even though your position is no worse off.

The IRS says 'Hell no!' You can either keep the position or you can keep the capital loss deduction. Not both."

2021-04-13 04:08:59,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. That makes sense. Thanks!
2021-04-13 07:28:49,wallstreetbets,Yea I've started a bit of option experimenting. These are pretty fun you basically only get screwed if the stock jumps way up if you're actually trying to get in it. I had some calls get assigned and used the cash to sell puts at a new entry point
2021-04-13 06:23:12,wallstreetbets,But that's a bullish play on a stock that went down 50% in the past month?

2021-04-13 07:41:16,wallstreetbets,Yes... I was agreeing with you.

2021-04-13 08:14:51,wallstreetbets,"But if I'm already shopping online I would choose GameStop over Amazon, I know I'm just one person but all it takes is more apes and other people to simply decide to shop GameStop online instead of Amazon.

Your big bauncho's who now own his art ""donate to charity"" for huge values due to this little party.

2021-04-13 04:17:57,wallstreetbets,"No there are calls and puts. Calls are bullish for the stock to go up where as with puts it's bearish and you're betting on the stock going down.

2021-04-13 04:30:10,wallstreetbets,"Options fluctuate in prices based on the stock price. If the stock goes down, call options go down.

The Lauder family made millions of dollars and paid nothing in taxes using a strategy called short sale against the box. They have all of these shares in their own company that are now worth a lot of money, but if they sell they have to realize gain and pay taxes. So they borrow more shares from the underwriter and sell those, a classic short sale. Economically, they've just sold their original shares, because they have cash in hand and a short position that's already covered by the shares they already owned. But on paper, they still have an open short position, and before 1259 was added, if you still had an open half of a transaction, you didn't have to realize gains until you closed it, so they effectively got all the money out of their shares without having to pay taxes on it, so Congress added this Constructive Sale rule."

Essentially so you can't gain tax benefits from the realized loss AND keep the position you were in. You have to pick one or the other. So, if you want to realize that loss, you have the exit the new position you opened up before the 30 days is over. So the capital loss is pushed down the road until you exit out of the second requisition of the shares (or it cancels out the gains if you end up selling it for a profit).

2021-04-13 10:44:48,wallstreetbets,"I was just thinking the same thing, before the short squeeze everyone I know absolutely hated gamestop. Sticking it to the hedge funds is a fun process but the company long term? It's just another asshole corporation that does shitty pawn shop trades. 

My buddy worked at gamestop part time a couple of years ago, completely for fun as he had a great salaried day job, worked at gamestop just because he loves games. Well gamestop had a secret under age shopper come in and he sold the 16 year old a mature rated game and got fired lol. He was so  bummed, he just wanted to talk to people about games and get them stoked on them. We out here acting like it's a corporation full of good people now for some reason."

2021-04-13 05:03:58,wallstreetbets,"It’s a bit pedantic I know. 

Calls are leveraged, but in this case bought without margin (which would increase the leverage even further).

Call options provide a leveraged position by increasing buying power. The movement of 100 shares for the cost of the premium.

The leveraged position is the premium is lower cost than buying shares."

2021-04-13 16:42:04,wallstreetbets,"You misread that, it doesn't say what you think it does.

Don't skip to the part you quoted, read the first section that describes the difference between options margin and equity margin.

You can ""only write options with margin"" because it's talking about options margin here, which by it's very definition can only apply to selling options.

That isn't the same as account margin, which you can absolutely use to buy options."
2021-04-13 19:07:52,wallstreetbets,"It's very true, I've never been a true WSB member as I don't do options I just invest medium to long but used to watch the sub on my old account due to the shit that went down here. Some of the old WSB members might have acted dumb but most knew what they were doing most of the time.

When it hit r/all most of these new guys don't even know what the greeks are, they have never traded properly before GME. Many FOMOed in hard and got caught up in the moment. OP is a good example, just look at that premium! Who the fuck in the right mind would pay that premium?! Buy the stock instead.

It really pissed me off when people tried to make it out to be some occupy wallstreet shit and both sides of politics made it political trying to claim. Old WSB didn't give a shit about politics, just making money. DFV did this for money (and a good job at it).

And don't get me started on how some are borderline acting like a cult here."
2021-04-13 04:14:17,wallstreetbets,"Here's quick and dumb explanation:

A 4/16/2021 $400 GME Call means that the contract will expire on the 16th of April, and that it can only be exercised if the market price of GME shares is above $400. For some reason, these contracts are for 100 shares, not less, not more, but you can buy multiple contracts if there are sellers (same as shares). That contract though has a price, called a premium, determined by the market, exactly like with the shares; in this case OP paid a premium of $172.80 per share, but since we know a contract is for 100 shares, that means OP paid $17 280 for the whole contract. And since OP bought many contracts, well it's five times that (though like with shares, you could buy each contract at a different price).

Unlike with shares, there are 2 ways to make money with a call: you can either sell it to someone else before it expires and make money that way, or you can exercise it but as we wrote before to exercise it it needs to be above the strike price, in this case $400. Exercising it, means buying the shares at the agreed price, so for a 100 shares you may need quite some cash to do that... In that case, the hope is that the shares you'll get by exercising the contract will be cheaper than at market rate, but since OP paid a huge premium, shares need to be over $572.80 for OP to make a benefit... So if shares cost $570, it would have been cheaper for OP to buy them from the market, but if they cost $575 OP made a benefit, a tiny one not worth the risk IMO.

Note, many people have made a lot of money by trading calls that never got passed the strike price, so the strike is not everything, but no one is going to buy your expensive call if it's so far away from being achievable.

Selling a call is the opposite, in this case someone took a premium of $172.80 per share, so $17 280 per contract, to later sell shares to OP at $400 per share. They're getting the money right away, and either are betting on the shares not reaching that price by expiration time, or just think they can do better with money right now. Their shares are locked though, so they won't be able to do anything with them until the contract expires, which can get annoying, if they change their mind and want to sell right away after all. You can definitely sell calls that you expect to end worthless simply to use that money to buy more of the shares.

If you get that, we can cover puts next.

2021-04-13 06:22:05,wallstreetbets,"What I dawn from all this is that this is pretty much gambling with a ton of extra steps.

Is the premium price of $172.80 not excessive? I thought premiums were like $2 to $5, not **this** high. 

In all honesty, OP is a friggin crazy for having put so much on such a high price point.

What I've learned in the last few years is that fads pretty much only go up 20-30% once they hit the MSM. When I first heard of GME and AMC on the news, I decided to buy and then dumped it after it would hit that mark, but because I did it much earlier than I would've in the past and the stock went up even faster, I ended up doubling my investment and then the second I saw it start to go down, I dumped and then both nosedived. 

I'll do the same shit the next time I see any herd mentality investment on the news from now on and dump at 30%. It's been so damn consistent from everything that I've seen so far. Usually it takes about a week for the fad to die.

I still think GME has fuel to run on, but I'll only buy again if it goes double digits.

I know this is not what this sub likes, but I'm pretty sure it's going to keep going down or hover around where it has been in the last week with a few changes, but the risk of it going under double-digits, to me, is pretty high. People won't see an opportunity until it starts to go up again significantly."
2021-04-13 05:00:02,wallstreetbets,"Sorry if I sound daft, you mention that when someone sells calls that the shares under contract are locked... so to sell calls does one have to own the promised shares? How about puts, does the seller have to own the shares to be able to sell puts as well?

Also, how can you tell that the strike price on these contracts is 400$ and why is it necessary for the stock to reach that price before the contract can be exercised? Why would someone want to exercise this contract regardless?"

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Big oil play - part 4 I’ve gotten a lot of requests for my views on the play with everything that’s happening in the world.

One word: bullish

We had a slight delay due to Europe covid, but the play is still strong.

Why?

US production is about to drop an additional 1-2mbd by the end of the year due to legacy declines in the various shale patches.

I also anticipate another 2-3mbd of declines from conventional wells in the opec and non opec nations due to underinvestment/damage from the shut ins.

The market believes that there is roughly 100mbd of production waiting for when the economy rips later this year. The problem is that there is realistically somewhere between 94-96mbd actually available.

The market will figure this out sometime this summer and shit will get real.

On top of that, BP, XOM, RDS, etc have all hinted at massive earnings incoming. 

Earnings are possibly the signal for them to rip higher.

Here are my current positions:

2675 BP $35 1/22 c
300 XOM $55 1/23 c
300 RDSA $60 1/22 c

This is not investment advice. I just like these stocks."

You checked-out $ET with its $18 Morningstar price target and insanely cheap fall and 1/22 calls, OP?

Midstream, but a decent undervalued co that got the snot beat out of it due to politics and bad press.

Insanely cheap OTM calls.

I’m in heavy in oil *services* as well (not as price-sensitive, but more volume).

Think $SLB is a deal there—many feel services have about bottomed. $OIH a terrific and safe oil services ETF too that can easily double with $80/bbl wti for a couple months

For producers/exploration, check $FANG and $EOG when wti starts to rise.

They go on multi-day +5-7% benders and print money. Both strong companies too—a little more movement than XOM/BP (but no hate for either)"

2021-04-12 22:55:01,wallstreetbets,I’ve been adding to my BP position off this dip.... share buy backs as well...🙏🏻 Do you think oil could go to 70 in the summer with hopefully higher demand?
2021-04-13 01:37:18,wallstreetbets,"Im from the UK and only buy physical shares but I got in far too early on this investment. Bought Shell and BP on the way down last March at bargain prices. Averaged down heavily when they were even bigger bargains at rock bottom and am up considerably on both. Most of this quarter the Brent oil price has been similar to what it was pre Covid, so I'm expecting decent earnings, especially BP as Shell were hit a bit by Texas freeze. 

Yeah I'm very bullish on oil due mainly to the permanent drop in Shale production, limited capex all over the world and I think we haven't seen peak demand yet even though green retards called it as 2019. Triple digit oil prices will be here soon. Also added GKP as they are literally the most undervalued producer on the planet although risky jurisdiction. 800M barrels of reserves, 55k bopd, and about $100M in cash and they are only valued at around £350M. 

Good luck oil bulls."

However assuming vaccines continue to work we should see a massive spike in demand here in the USA. Hopefully the same happens for Europe.

When those contracts expire they will be in a better position to take advantage of higher pricing especially if drilling stays on pace with Q1. The volumes from legacy wells will fall off and we will be producing several million less per day. I think the real upside comes in 8-10 months in preparation for summer travel of 2022. Companies that are disciplined and have been able to reduce debt and lock in better service pricing will be ITM

[Screenshot of one of my portfolios](https://preview.redd.it/izffn53j4vs61.png?width=1835&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eeac0d1018d50149561d986f02d6152bf77f25a)

&#x200B;

In my trading career beyond having a strategy (actually multiple depending on market state and asset class) to base my trades on nothing has ever been as important as having a Trading plan. In this post I want to share with you my personal trading plan to help you create a set of rules that will help you stick to your plan and keep your emotions in check so that you can actually follow your trading strategy and become a consistently profitable trader.

Something that was and still is key for me is the following realization:

Never get attached to your opinion or view of why something should happen. The market is in fact always right and based on nothing but irrationality since its made by humans so the movements of the market do not have to make sense and at more times than not will not make sense.

Trading is simply a mind game. Markets are a result of mass psychology which leads to exploitable edges. Mastering your own psychology is key to keep following the strategy that defines your edge.

So now without further ado my trading plan template that has helped me so much over the years and I hope will help you as well:

**\*\*General Rules\*\***

1. Never enter a trade without a plan (TP,SL)
2. Once you are in a trade stick to the plan
3. Its ok to be wrong its not about being right its about making money
4. Be patient do not act on FOMO
5. Do not chase the market
6. Let your winners run and cut your losses short

**\*\*The 5 fundamental truths\*\***

1. Anything can happen.
2. You don't need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money.
3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge.
4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another.
5. Every moment in the market is unique.

**\*\*Rules of consistency\*\*I AM A CONSISTENT WINNER BECAUSE:**

1. I objectively identify my edges.
2. I have predefined risk of every trade.
3. I completely accept risk or I am willing to let go of the trade.
4. I act on my edges without reservation or hesitation.
5. I pay myself as the market makes money available to me.
6. I continually monitor my susceptibility for making errors.
7. I understand the absolute necessity of these principles of consistent success and, therefore, I never violate them.

**\*\*Risk and Money Management\*\***

Do not increase the standard trade size before you doubled the account.

1. The maximum amount you are allowed to lose in a day is $XXX.

 2. The maximum amount you are allowed to lose on any single trade is $XXX.

 3. The maximum number of losing trades in a row you are allowed to have in a day before you stop trading is two. 

4. The maximum number of losing trades you are allowed to have in a day before you stop trading is five. (You may have had a win or two between losses, but there is a time to stop trading.) The maximum number of losing trades in the same direction you are allowed to take in a day before you stop trading is three.

 1. If you are up $XXX on a single trade, you will put a profit floor of $XXX underneath the current price to protect a portion of those profits. 

2. If you are up $XXX on a single trade, you will take the money and close out the trade.

 3. If you are up $XXX for the day, you will take the rest of the day off, stay away from the trading screens, and do something you enjoy doing—other than trading

4. If you are up $XXX for the month, you will put a profit floor of $XXX underneath the month's profits to protect a portion of those profits. If you are up $XXX for the month, you will take the rest of the month off, stay away from the trading screens, and do something you enjoy doing—other than trading! Take a vacation, sleep late and read books, or do something else fun.

I created this trading plan years ago and am only sharing it with the community now (never spent much time on social media). It is a mix of my own ideas, ideas from fellow traders and books I have read over the years. One book in particular that I highly recommend and that has hugely influenced my trading plan and journey as a trader is: Trading In The Zone from Mark Douglas."

2021-04-13 05:30:48,wallstreetbets,"The biggest issue with this that you don't point out...

You have millions.  People who only have thousands can't do what you do.  Your want to treat yourself to a new car, you pull out 5% of your *profits* to pay for it.  Someone without that money wants to treat themselves to a new car, they would need to pull out *everything* and then they'd have nothing.  You want to sell covered calls?  You can make a killing on selling Amazon or Tesla CCs each week.  Someone with a couple thousand wants to sell CCs?  They are pushed into a much lower value stock where they either have to go all in on something like GE or F (if they want something they can be confident in at the very least) or they sell CCs on some trash stock or diversify with unproven penny stocks that barely pay premiums on theta.  Would you willingly go all in on a penny stock to sell CCs on hopes of your money growing there?  Or would you consider that too risky?

You're consistently profitable partially because you have solid fundamentals that you work with, but you *also have a large initial sum of money*.  That's the key that makes it work.  Yeah, being stupid with a lot of money will lose a lot of money, we've seen that plenty here.  But many people here just don't have that money to start with.  If they just follow your percentages, they still can't be as successful as you because a 50% gain over a year on $1000 is still only $500, that's money that someone like you can make in a few hours easily.

I'm not saying your fundamentals are wrong.  You're smart.  You're playing the market intelligently.  You're doing things right.  It's just that you're telling tons of people who don't have the initial start that you have to work with that they're just doing it wrong.  They can't create any kind of success doing it your way unless they suddenly get wealthy enough on some big play first.  And that's why they go for the big plays.

2% a year on $10m will pay for a comfortable life living solely on profits (160k per year after taxes), and that's without taking a penny out of the initial investment.  2% a year on $10k only gives you $160 after taxes for the year.  It would take several lifetimes to turn that $10k into $10m at 2% per year.  And that's just to finally reach a point where you will live on the same profits.

You see the difference?"

2021-04-13 06:43:14,wallstreetbets,You jerked me off and then walked away before I finished - your post is great but isn't the most important thing talking about what your 'edge' is and how you make your trading decisions?

2021-04-13 10:28:38,wallstreetbets,"That's not a trading plan...That's just you telling us about your day with some fake guru formatting...

I mean what, your advice is actually to use stop losses and take profit? Without percentage or anything? And that you identify your edges ? (how, what are your edges, how do you define what it is before it realizes, etc). Sometimes it's literally you telling us shit that doesn't make sense. I particularly like  ""I completely accept risk or I am willing to let go of the trade.""... Ma dude you can't set your SL/TP and then not let them run.... There is nothing to accept once the exits are set, just wait.

2021-04-13 00:33:19,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate the post. 

I’ve heard many times about cutting losers. 


I have made some recent mistakes shifting my assets at the all time highs. Took a 20% hit no more than 2 weeks after. 

While most of my assets are now within reach of being green,  a few leaps have been hurting. I presume because they are now OTM and have low delta. 

Specifically my ARKK Call at 135strike. Even though it expires in 2 years, it is -50% right now.  I constantly debate whether I should DCA or cut my losses. The reason why I’m leaning towards DCA is because I still believe in the stocks within the etf and want Tesla exposure. 

Is there some insight you may have on this predicament?"

2021-04-13 09:27:24,wallstreetbets,"I mean - you're not wrong. Its way easier to make more money when you have a larger initial pile.  

But these rules (I recognize a lot of the principles from Mark Douglas) - are about generating consistent profits. Yeah, starting with $10k you aren't going to get to life-changing money in a year like you might with YOLOs and FD lottos - but if you can grow that consistently 20% ARR over the year, then you start the next year with $12k, and more discipline, and a (hopefully) stronger system, so maybe you do a bit better - maybe 30%. Or the market changes on you, invalidating your system, and you do a bit worse.

The point is - this is the most reliable way to wealth accumulation. It's not going to get you to F-U money for years (if you are starting small), but it gives you a better chance than gambling on meme stocks.  Doesn't mean you can't get lucky on meme stocks & YOLOs (plenty of people here have), but it's going to be really difficult to do that consistently - which means, if you don't have a disciplined system (or you don't just quit after your first big win), you're probably going to eventually lose it all gambling here.

(FWIW - I don't have a great system and I'm still gambling here, hoping to get to that F-U money level, and THEN I'll start to get smart about how I trade & manage risk. At least, that's what I tell myself 😉)"

2021-04-13 05:18:28,wallstreetbets,You can stop counting.  There are 52.
2021-04-13 00:06:17,wallstreetbets,sorry had a typo in there with two vs three. Its about switching bias. When you continue to trade in the same direction sticking to your thesis even though the market is telling you otherwise its a bad thing. Latest after the market has proven you wrong two times your thesis should be invalidated and you should switch bias.
2021-04-13 00:37:31,wallstreetbets,It really largely depends on your investment thesis. If you have valid reasons to believe that ARKK will be going up over the next to years then stick with it and use the lower prices DCA. If however your investment thesis has been invalidated cut your losses.
2021-04-13 00:44:07,wallstreetbets,it is thats the whole point ;) Money management is coming from game theory and was made popular by professional gamblers. If you play the markets like they play the casinos you are already way ahead of the herd.
2021-04-13 06:36:17,wallstreetbets,Keep pulling your stop loss further and further into the profit so you never give up to much of your profits again. Its always a balance between giving the trade enough room to run vs not giving it too much. It largely comes down to your investment thesis and time horizon. Vuzix for example I am in for the long run as the industry is just getting started so I have my stop loss only barely above break even giving it a lot of room to run.

2021-04-13 07:52:21,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂😂
2021-04-13 11:17:06,wallstreetbets,Setting the SL according to the risk reward ratio you are going for is what defines your risk and you need to match it with your investment thesis. If you believe any asset is going to go up for whatever reason there will always be a point where your thesis will be invalidated. Ideally you match this with your SL. It is about finding entries that have a good risk reward ratio. I only trade trending markets and usually in the direction of the trend. So I will be looking for a pullback that does not break the trend and enter on that pullback. I put my SL at or near the point where this thesis would be invalidated by actually breaking the trend and switching bias. This way I have a predefined risk in terms of amount of money I am willing to lose to figure out if my thesis was right and the trade will work out.

2021-04-13 17:32:50,wallstreetbets,"You're right, and I never said his system is invalidated.  I'm simply pointing out that it works so much better the more wealth that is started with.

Someone starting with just 5k and pulling off 20% per year (that's kinda huge) only makes $800 after taxes, assuming this was through trading and not through an investment that is held.  The end of the first year shows $5800 in the account, nothing withdrawn for self reward, only taxes.  The second year shows around $6700, with again no self reward and only paying taxes. After 5 years, the account value is right around $10.3k after taxes.  5 years, not a single withdrawn penny to treat yourself.  Didn't his post say to pull some profits out here and there for that purpose?

Well, let's pull out enough to get a new $1000 laptop.  After all, you need a better system, it's been 5 years, and you're spending that money investing in a machine to help you do your trading better, right?  Well that $1000 withdrawal is approximately the last 9+ months in gains gone.  The next 6 months of trading is solely to get your account back to where it was to cover the cost of that laptop.  If you make another purchase next year, there goes even more progress.

Let's say that you *don't* treat yourself to anything with your profits.  5 years at 20% gains per year (again, you're a fucking trading prodigy to consistently pull this shit off with lower account balance and being unable to get the big stuff) just to get to 10k from 5k.  5 more years to get to 20k.  At around 20+ years in, you finally have $100k.  You could pull everything out and get a house!  ... Except property costs have gone up in 20 years now and you need twice as much compared to 20 years ago, aka today.  So you go for *another* 5 years.  Oh well, 25 years total and you get your house finally.  And now you have almost nothing in your account again because you just treated yourself to a house.  Yeah, it was fully paid off, but now you're back to nothing again.

And remember, this is $5k turned into a house in 25 years without ever pulling a penny out to get yourself something nice.  25 years.  In the meantime, someone who starts with the money to buy a house can make enough to buy a house and still have the initial investment left over while paying themselves periodically over the course of 10 years.

This is the difference.  This is why it doesn't quite work the way the people with the money think it works for the people without the money.  Do you think that someone used to wealth can pull off not touching the account to buy something nice for 25 years just to be able to keep growing at a decent rate?  They're paying themselves periodically, but people with less *literally can't* otherwise they massively lengthen the amount of time it takes to finally reach goals.

Just taking out $500 each year on that $5k investment growing at 20% per year will mean that the amount of time it takes to reach $10k will be approximately 10-15 years.  It starts being far less of an impact the further time goes on, but it's huge in the beginning.  $500 withdrawn on a $100k account doesn't impact much of anything, but it kills a $5k account.

I'm just trying to point these things out.  Nothing more.  OPs strategy isn't bad.  It's great actually.  It just doesn't work for many people here.  Believe it or not, many of us are more than intelligent enough to know *how* to consistently build wealth like this, but just *can't* in any kind of timely manner because we'll be too old or dead by the time we finally have enough to do what we want with it.  So people here YOLO and have some fun with it instead.

And I'll support them as a friend for it even though I won't participate in their 100% YOLOs myself because at the very least, *I understand*."
2021-04-13 08:43:10,wallstreetbets,"Less than 100k as in 5 grand? Or let’s be honest here, less than $100k could mean $75-80k which is like two whole years salary after taxes for the average American. 

That’s not almost nothing.  That’s a HUGE amount of money."
2021-04-13 16:59:56,wallstreetbets,"And do you genuinely think that people with just a few thousand can turn it into something that grows on itself enough in a timely manner using your proven advice?  Or do you think that ""less than 100k"" from ten years ago (what were the best stocks priced at back then compared to now in comparison?) is enough to accomplish the same thing that ""less than 100k"" can do right now?

Again, I'm not saying that you're full of shit.  I fully agree that the advice that you're giving is smart and it's what people should follow to make money grow.  The issue is just that the small guys can't do a fraction of what you can do, and you're talking to a lot of small guys in the market.  We can't exactly expect that 8% of our portfolio in AMZN for 0.0420% of a share is going to take off and turn into 100 on a stock split eventually that we can sell CCs on in the future, we'd be dead before that ever happened."

I agree with a lot of her research, although some of it looks to be a bit exaggerated (Tesla thesis). Many of the stocks in the etf are stocks I’d want to hold on to long term so I thought it was a slam dunk. 

I’ve been getting into more wheel type activities and even wanted to start delving into some leaps with PMCCs of companies I’d want to hold long term (think Microsoft,apple, NVIDIA, ) and some index funds. 

Right now it’s just a war torn portfolios with a sea of red and a splattering of green (thanks apple).

2021-04-13 02:21:45,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the stock market
2021-04-13 03:12:39,wallstreetbets,Completely depends on your investment thesis. I guess for a lot of guys here the investment thesis came from deepfuckingvalue how considers that GME is undervalued and will turn their business around in the future if thats your opinion at the price today stick with it otherwise if your investment thesis is invalidated cut your losses.
2021-04-13 04:17:29,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer that I am in fact a retard with a marble inside my skull, and I probably have no fucking clue what I'm on about here, but I like the internets, so here you go.

If you think it will rebound, then start selling \~10% OTM cc weeklies and start to whittle away at that cost basis. It's gonna take a long time to make a significant dent, but if you still believe in your thesis then diamond hand that bitch and take the small returns while you wait. This is slightly riskier with WSB meme stocks as they tend to have bigger swings so 10% may not be enough.

If you think it's a shitter, then dump it and buy something nicer. Don't wait if you don't think it'll rebound."
2021-04-13 03:19:15,wallstreetbets,"Hedge and sell calls. Stocks are easy mode. Let's see you down 80% on options with the clock ticking to expiration, having to decide to average down or spend more money on a losing position rolling out for additional time or changing strikes, all with the realization your investment could go to zero.

Again, stocks are easy. But you should learn options to hedge your stock positions. Start with covered calls."

2021-04-12 23:33:01,wallstreetbets,You’re welcome. I fucking hate bush flies.
2021-04-13 00:47:54,wallstreetbets,Well personally I believe she does have some good picks but her meteoric rise was largely due to last years crash and the monetary policy since then basically leading you to be able to buy almost anything and come out hugely profitable on the other side.
2021-04-13 04:45:09,wallstreetbets,Its 2 k per month/ license. Its very useful to have all information in one place and also to trade off directly. There is no other tool that is this comprehensive and combines everything in one place which saves you so much time doing analysis. As free and very good alternative I can recommend koyfin. Not that feature complete yet but still awesome.
2021-04-13 11:32:35,wallstreetbets,Yes I always do in day trading. When the market suddenly reverses there is a high probability it will continue to run against you. I never want to be trapped in a losing trade: learned that one the hard way.
2021-04-13 00:54:24,wallstreetbets,Nah I'm just jaded and trust no one and didn't read to the end: he recommended a book. Imma read that book half waiting for my dude's WSB trading course to launch tho.
2021-04-13 02:57:11,wallstreetbets,"Here in my garage, just bought this new Lamborghini here. It’s fun to drive up here in the Hollywood hills. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Knowledge. In fact, I’m a lot more proud of these seven new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold two thousand new books that I bought. It’s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, “the more you learn, the more you earn.”

Now maybe you’ve seen my TEDx talk where I talk about how I read a book a day. You know, I read a book a day not to show off it’s again about the knowledge. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it’s a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven dollars in my bank account. I didn’t have a college degree, I had no opportunities.

But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a mentor. And another mentor. And a few more mentors. I found five mentors. And they showed me what they did to become multimillionaires. Again, it’s not just about money, it’s about the good life; health, wealth, love and happiness. And so I record a little video, it’s actually on my website, you can click here on this video and it’ll take you to my website where I share three things that they taught me. Three things that you can implement today no matter where you are.

Now, this isn’t a “get rich quick” scheme. You know, like they say if things sound too good to be true they are too good to be true. I’m not promising you that tomorrow you’re gonna be able to go out and buy a Lamborghini. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven steps. So, I record a little two minute video on my website. Like I said, now it’s not the most professional I just shot it here with my iPhone, but it’s real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And I’m going to give you the three most important things you can do today. So click the link, go there it’s completely free to watch it it’s just a couple minutes. Invest in yourself. Always be curious. Don’t be a cynic. Okay, people see videos like this and they say “Ah that’s not real that’s for somebody else.”

Don’t listen, don’t listen. Be an optimist. Like, Conrad Hilton, the man who started Hilton Hotel, he said that he was only fifteen years old when he read a book by Helen Keller, and that book changed his life. Books can change your life. And in that book, Helen Keller said “optimism” so if you’re a cynic, if you’re a pessimist you don’t need to click here. Don’t worry about it, I don’t need to talk to everybody. But if you’re somebody who knows that there’s something better, cause the dream is possible, you know, for some of you watching it’s not necessarily a Lamborghini, maybe it’s a new job, a new opportunity, starting your own company.

Maybe it’s a new lifestyle without so much stress, traveling the world, doing those things you know you’re destined to do. You can do those unless you understand finances. Money, I don’t call it money anymore, I call it fuel units. You must have enough fuel units to live out your dream and to live out your destiny. So, I’ll see you on my website, it’s a quick video and you’ll see there absolutely free.

So just click this video and you’ll be taken there in a second, and uh, I’m excited to share this amazing stuff. You’ll see, not because of anything of me but because I’ve been fortunate enough to learn from mentors many years ahead of me. Not just in books like these, although I love books but also real in-person mentors. So let me share with you these three tips that have made all the difference in my life. They’re practical, you can do them today, you can start on them today. All right? See you there on my site."

&#x200B;

Hey Guys!

edit: New format for legibility, it was a mess.

**I was reading about:**

The IEX (Investors Exchange): [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEX), this exchange purports to be an exchange that is friendly to retail investors.

""IEX's main innovation is a 38-mile (61 km) coil of [optical fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber)placed  in front of its trading engine. This 350 microsecond delay  adds  a   round-trip delay of 0.0007 seconds and is designed to negate  the    certain speed advantages utilized by some high-frequency traders.""

Additionally they created the D-Limit Order to fight High Frequency Traders.

[https://iextrading.com/alerts/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjkUf1YX2kUVNxyJ9ED4TMT-MwhzOcEl1yFsggqUlbU1ZC3WDQDMFsgaAtuMEALw\_wcB#/121](https://iextrading.com/alerts/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjkUf1YX2kUVNxyJ9ED4TMT-MwhzOcEl1yFsggqUlbU1ZC3WDQDMFsgaAtuMEALw_wcB#/121)

&#x200B;

**The possible DFV references:**

On March 26th DFV made a few tweets that didn't seem to make sense.

DFV tweeted Flash Gordon a possible reference to the IEX as detailed in [*Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Boys:_A_Wall_Street_Revolt) by Michael Lewis.

DFV tweeted a cat slapping a drone, which is a possible reference to fighting the robotic or Trading Algos.

*Thanks to* [*u/TabrisSeele*](https://www.reddit.com/u/TabrisSeele/)  *for contributed this link:* [*https://iextrading.com/trading/*](https://iextrading.com/trading/)*, it lists brokerages that will send trades to them.*

***Common Question:***  ""Hey how come I see Citadel listed on IEX's website?""

IEX  is an exchange, like the NYSE, people trade there.  It doesn't make  sense for Citadel to limit who they trade with, but they will have a  disadvantage when trading there due to the ""Speed Bump"" time delay.

&#x200B;

*Contributed by* [u/OG\_simple\_rhyme\_time](https://www.reddit.com/user/OG_simple_rhyme_time)

*This is from an article from one of the DDs from yesterday that appeared in 2015, who knows how bad its got since then:*

*""In  Connect, Citadel makes active retail orders it has bought from  retail  brokerages available to institutional investors and other firms.*

*Very  few stock orders that retail investors place with their brokers,  such  as Charles Schwab Corp, TD Ameritrade, or Fidelity, go through  public  stock exchanges, such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s New York  Stock  Exchange. Instead, the brokers send the orders to other brokerage   firms like Citadel, or KCG Holdings, which trade against the incoming   orders, and then send the leftovers to other internalizers, dark pools,   or as a last resort, exchanges.*

*By  doing this, the retail brokers not only avoid paying fees to the   exchanges for active orders, but actually receive payments and trading   rebates from the off-exchange trading venues.""*

*All the brokers we think are clean, are doing all of retail very dirty. GLE*

&#x200B;

**How to route orders to a different exchange:**

Seems even routing to NYSE or ARCA directly is better than the default for many brokers who use Dark Pools/Citadel as a standard.

If you don't have a brokerage that will allow routing **DON'T PANIC.**  It is not necessary for people to switch, no broker is perfect (I see your Dark Pool Fidelity!).  Stay where you are, the squeeze will happen or not.  This post was more about **AWARENESS**  of the options you may have when placing trades in the stock market.

&#x200B;

**ETrade Pro**

This is how I change it in ETrade Pro.  I cannot find a way to change it  using the WebPortal or Power ETrade.  It looks like it is locked behind  Pro account requirements.

**TD Ameritrade**

*Contributed by* [*u/loldavelol*](https://www.reddit.com/u/loldavelol/)

*TDAmeritrade offers Direct Order   Routing to the Exchanges. ""Direct Routing,"" as TDA calls it, allows you   to select a routing destination for your stock or options order.*

***It is a feature that must be enabled. It is disabled by default.***

*When disabled, all orders on TDA are submitted via* [*\[""Smart Routing""\]*](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/order-execution.page)*, listed at the bottom of the page:*

>*Execution quality statistics provided by S3 Matching Technologies*

*Which, if is the same S3 that reports SI, was recently learned to be owned by Citadel* [*\[1\]*](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/me2xrj/the_s3_partners_ownership_rabbithole/) *&* [*\[2\]*](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mo2811/let_me_tell_you_the_tale_of_s3_partners_a/)

*Once   Direct Routing is Enabled, this allows users to circumvent Kenny G  from  poaching orders by routing orders directly to the exchange floor  via  IEX, instead of through Citadel and NYSE/ARCA.*

*The downsides:*

* *Orders may not get the best pricing (pennies on the share, TDA quotes savings $1.27 per 100 shares)*
* *Might be more susceptible to partial fills (IE: $135 for 10 might fill for 3 until 7 more are found).*
* *IEX is also only available during regular market hours, so no access to AM/PM trading.*

*Unfortunately, on TDA, IEX orders have to be submitted from the Stock Buy/Sell Screen and cant be routed from SnapTicket.*

***Conclusion:***

*If GME buyers started routing orders from their brokers through IEX then we would* *~~apply massive buying pressure to the share price away from the NYSE flow that Citadel Controls~~* *bypass Citadel as the MM.*

*Bonus, Citadel sued the SEC after approving IEX as a pathway to the stock market.* [*\[1\]*](https://www.google.com/search?q=citadel+iex&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS821US821&oq=&aqs=chrome.2.69i59i450l8.564081j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

>*“The   SEC failed to properly consider the costs and burdens imposed by this   proposal that will undermine the reliability of our markets and harm   tens of millions of retail investors,” a Citadel Securities spokeswoman   said in an email on Friday.*

*Sounds like IEX is a threat to Citadel's position as an NYSE DMM.*

*Contributed by* [*u/myco\_mage*](https://www.reddit.com/user/myco_mage)

*I got my direct routing for equities on TD Ameritrade working. I guess I  wasn't allowed to do it because I had something called ""advanced  features"" activated The way you can tell is by going to client  services>general>elections and routing And if you don't see a  setting called ""contingency triggers"" under forex you have advanced  features enabled. Contact TDA to get them removed*

*Even with direct routing of equities enabled you won't be able to pick  your exchange on the think or swim mobile app, choosing your exchange is  limited to the basic TD Ameritrade app or the think or swim desktop  application*

**TD DI** *Contributed by* [u/aholl50](https://www.reddit.com/user/aholl50)

*Hey so I looked into TD  Direct Investing (TD DI) for Canadian apes using TD Canada Trust and it  seems all US-listed equities are routed through the TD Ameritrade arm  and are subject to TDA default best execution protocol. Unfortunately, I  cannot find any information on WebBroker for choosing a different  exchange when buying using TD DI. Seems like Canadian apes using TD DI  don't have the option of switching exchanges in this case, hoping others  can keep digging and find more info or a potential alternative versus  switching brokers.*

2021-04-13 06:14:35,wallstreetbets,"This is from an article from one of the DDs from yesterday that appeared in 2015, who knows how bad its got since then:

""In Connect, Citadel makes active retail orders it has bought from retail brokerages available to institutional investors and other firms.

Very few stock orders that retail investors place with their brokers, such as Charles Schwab Corp, TD Ameritrade, or Fidelity, go through public stock exchanges, such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s New York Stock Exchange. Instead, the brokers send the orders to other brokerage firms like Citadel, or KCG Holdings, which trade against the incoming orders, and then send the leftovers to other internalizers, dark pools, or as a last resort, exchanges.

By doing this, the retail brokers not only avoid paying fees to the exchanges for active orders, but actually receive payments and trading rebates from the off-exchange trading venues.""

All the brokers we think are clean, are doing all of retail very dirty. GLE"

To do this you need to use Streetsmart Edge available here: https://client.schwab.com/secure/cc/trade/trading_tools/sse
Streetsmart Edge has to be enabled by calling Schwab and having it enabled (there are no requirements its just not enabled by default).
and enable Direct Access here (no published requirements, but disabled by default): https://client.schwab.com/secure/cc/trade/trading_tools/direct_access

2021-04-13 14:46:08,wallstreetbets,"IEX does indeed have a mile of fibre that introduces microseconds of latency. It's ridiculous. They could have done it in software on their network hardware. But the fibre is better for news articles.

Anyway, it does what it purports to do. It slows things down.

But if HFTs still have a dozen other places to do their dirty tricks, IEX hardly makes a difference. Wish it were different, but that's the way it is.

Routing your orders to IEX is a way to support the exchange. They make money from each fill.

In IBKR if you switch from SMART routing to IEX you're not guaranteed the best price. SMART might send your order to an ECN (""dark pool"") but only if it offers price improvement."

2021-04-13 18:22:18,wallstreetbets,"It's rather interesting discussion, because we are talking fractions of a second for a computer to get the jump on the trade, where as for the likes of me, on the other side of the Pacific ocean from the nyse, anyone trading on nyse from outside the continent wouldn't even get a look in because fo the time it took to for the information to travel that far."

2021-04-13 19:35:15,wallstreetbets,Fucking retail never stood a chance huh. Lmao after learning all this shit. What the hell.
2021-04-13 07:43:38,wallstreetbets,Also commenting for visibility!
2021-04-13 08:41:49,wallstreetbets,Legit thought this was said satire at first. Didn't expect to learn some new way my orders get ass blasted by Wall Street. Good to know!
2021-04-13 08:07:11,wallstreetbets,The problem is no one is trading... We already have the stock
2021-04-13 08:32:06,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't this (routing to a single specific exchange, and an intentionally slow one at that) result in substantially worse fills on your order? So you'd be losing on commission and losing on execution price and speed."

2021-04-13 08:19:31,wallstreetbets,"I see citadel securities as an
iex partner on their site.  That’s my contribution"
2021-04-13 08:21:21,wallstreetbets,I have been with TD Ameritrade for over 2 years and I have no complaints. Their free “think or swim” platform provides a lot more information than their more simplistic platform.  I did NOT know about this feature though. Thanks
2021-04-13 08:22:47,wallstreetbets,You can  use direct routing with the IBKR app! Just look for the ISIN (case sensitive) instead of the ticker and then you should see multiple entries where you can select the exchange
2021-04-13 08:26:25,wallstreetbets,So does schwaub or fidelity let you use IEX?
2021-04-13 08:31:07,wallstreetbets,"TD Ameritrade will only let you do direct routing on options

Edit: just talked to TD and apparently the reason I can't enable director routing for equities is because I have advanced features enabled, which from what I understand is something that gives you more features on their active trader pro platform"
2021-04-13 17:04:17,wallstreetbets,You... don't know what dark pools are. Making the rest of your dd nonsense. 🤔
2021-04-13 06:24:43,wallstreetbets,I hope so! Let's GO!
2021-04-13 06:20:16,wallstreetbets,"> IEX is legit, got a lot of haters.

makes perfect sense, doesnt it?"
2021-04-13 05:46:35,wallstreetbets,"the tides are shifting. Biden made a comment after the first GME blowup about how they were going to look into plumbing. The weekend after, IEXtrading patent page shortened drastically."
2021-04-13 18:17:45,wallstreetbets,This explains the routing concept https://youtu.be/gBf46PjkmG0
2021-04-12 22:22:09,wallstreetbets,"Usually when you place the order with your brokerage, they send it to an exchange to be traded.  High Frequency Traders can then poach the order by buying it and matching it to a higher offer, they pocket the difference.

The IEX tries to prevent that by slowing the HFT's down to your speed."
2021-04-13 05:37:59,wallstreetbets,"It would help with things like Latency Arbitrage.

As Brad K so elegantly describes it, latency arbitrage in simple terms is:

>like a horse race, typically they don't take bets after a horse race has started. On the stock market, people are betting in real-time and the issue is that some people know the horse crossed the line and can go out and bet against people who think the race is still happening.

He goes onto believing it creates a multi-tier system that apes don't have access to."
2021-04-13 09:05:07,wallstreetbets,Anyone know which one Schwab uses?
2021-04-12 22:33:52,wallstreetbets,I’m honestly so confused could you explain what this even is?.
2021-04-13 04:18:19,wallstreetbets,"Replying here for others: 

Most brokers will allow you to pick the exchange you want to send your  order to, by default they will have it set to ""auto"" or a specific one.   The post has a list of brokers that will trade with IEX.  How you route  your trade is specific to the brokerage, I included a picture of how  ETrade Pro does it."
2021-04-13 09:41:26,wallstreetbets,"wait until more DD comes out, I'm hoping this is a tool to help apes but who knows"
2021-04-13 06:31:56,wallstreetbets,Sweet
2021-04-13 10:42:36,wallstreetbets,"""You get to trade for free*""

*the fee is we fuck you in the ass when you buy or sell, decide when you've made enough, or cheat when we lose"
2021-04-13 06:46:34,wallstreetbets,Post: UPDATED!
2021-04-13 11:12:03,wallstreetbets,Thanks for this mate!
2021-04-12 23:00:51,wallstreetbets,"Your opinions may be unpopular, but I dig the flair. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)"
2021-04-13 07:27:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I really feel like OP would at least be well served to reverse the order, the DD followed by the conspiracy theory, instead of the conspiracy theory pump up for the DD - it’s interesting but it sure isn’t qualifying. DFV tweet tarot readings have a pretty high failure rate."
2021-04-13 06:41:23,wallstreetbets,"Is this the brad from Flash boys? The 'sequel' to the big short?
Edit: it is him. He's a good guy, doesn't like high frequency freaks"
2021-04-13 07:39:55,wallstreetbets,"well I learned i could change my order on direct routing on TOS, something ive used for over a decade! So it was informative for me"
2021-04-12 22:37:21,wallstreetbets,Thank you.  I won't make a habit of it.
2021-04-13 04:50:27,wallstreetbets,"Not really sure why there was any need for all the conspiracy theory in OP.

What was wrong with plain info about the exchange and what they do?"
2021-04-13 06:29:38,wallstreetbets,"I read this with my tin foil hat on...I like IEX though, loved the Flash Boys book by Michael Lewis."
2021-04-13 01:56:52,wallstreetbets,I make non conspiracy posts and they get removed. Lol great standards.
2021-04-13 06:22:11,wallstreetbets,Thanks!

2021-04-13 06:59:10,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-04-13 07:08:23,wallstreetbets,Nice!
2021-04-13 08:27:39,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-13 07:21:42,wallstreetbets,Cross post it.  It was never about credit.  All apes should see.
2021-04-13 05:19:32,wallstreetbets,"Agree, I found out about it yesterday.  I'm sure awareness is really low about this great exchange."
2021-04-13 07:03:52,wallstreetbets,Agreed!
2021-04-13 10:13:00,wallstreetbets,Do you have to do it every time you place a buy order?
2021-04-13 06:22:33,wallstreetbets,Hopefully enough Apes will be able to and it will be enough.
2021-04-13 08:11:21,wallstreetbets,"Ahh, I just emailed them too! Guess it'll add more pressure... I'm looking to change to a broker that doesn't do me dirty!

This deserves and needs to blow up. Enough people leaving T212 may encourage them to adopt as a feature.

EDIT:

My request:
1)Please route my Buy Orders to IEX exchange

T212 response:
1) That option not available yet.
2) Submitted as a request.
3) Cannot provide an ETA for approval

Hmmm... interesting. Act fast T212 or I'll end up with yet another broker account!"
2021-04-13 06:57:05,wallstreetbets,"I don't try google? If you get the answer, send to me, I'll add it to the post."
2021-04-13 06:59:29,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-04-13 07:08:04,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-04-13 09:48:49,wallstreetbets,Please tell me this was a Sandler reference
2021-04-13 03:24:57,wallstreetbets,"It’s an exchange, like the NYSE, you can send your trade to be filled there instead of wherever your brokerage defaults to."
2021-04-13 07:31:39,wallstreetbets,"In Fidelity you CAN direct trade routes, just not to IEX, but pick something other than their default, which goes through a Dark Pool."
2021-04-13 06:24:27,wallstreetbets,"Can't Stop, Won't Stop, GameStop!"
2021-04-13 06:58:45,wallstreetbets,"It's in the post, Fidelity doesn't allow routing to IEX, but definitely look at the exchanges they do allow and switch off the default.  Their default uses Dark Pools."
2021-04-13 11:29:34,wallstreetbets,"[third-from-last](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/advanced-trading-tools/active-trader-pro/faqs) FAQ on this page lists the available trade routing exchange options.

2021-04-13 07:32:04,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-04-13 13:07:18,wallstreetbets,IBKR is available for europeans. They have a lot of EU customers.
2021-04-13 12:48:47,wallstreetbets,I'm not familiar with your trading platforms.  If you have info to add I'll add it.
2021-04-13 11:21:54,wallstreetbets,"Welcome, many helped."
2021-04-13 12:58:10,wallstreetbets,"Now that's an interesting point.  He's the dude people got mad at for ""turning it off"" in January."
2021-04-13 13:00:35,wallstreetbets,Nice!
2021-04-12 23:19:23,wallstreetbets,"Possible, I don't claim to be a whisperer or anything.  I just saw some coincidences while I was reading on IEX and D-Limit orders."
2021-04-13 00:42:21,wallstreetbets,You’re welcome.  Anything I can do to help the cause.
2021-04-13 05:54:04,wallstreetbets,How the hell have I never seen this movie!
2021-04-13 06:40:05,wallstreetbets,Weird that movie seems to have disappeared.  All those links in YT are dead.
2021-04-13 07:59:43,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-04-13 10:05:20,wallstreetbets,"They put no pressure on the open market.

Citadel was using this to their advantage yesterday: send all buy orders to be filled in a dark pool and send all sell orders to the open market.

The open market then thinks there's only sell orders and no buy orders, so the price drops significantly faster, when in reality that isn't true."
2021-04-13 10:22:32,wallstreetbets,I'm also interested to know
2021-04-13 12:53:32,wallstreetbets,Say what?
2021-04-13 11:35:34,wallstreetbets,"IEX is an exchange, it doesn't make sense for them not to take trades on all exchanges, but they will have a disadvantage due to the ""speed bump"""
2021-04-13 11:28:05,wallstreetbets,"There was some, it didn't look like vanguard allowed you to manually route orders."
2021-04-13 12:25:59,wallstreetbets,Cool
2021-04-13 12:55:15,wallstreetbets,I think it was innocent at that point.  Fidelity was just one of the only brokerages that didn't restrict trading in GME.  They are big and independent so they didn't get forced to by Citadel.  Doesn't mean they don't have their own problems.
2021-04-13 12:55:36,wallstreetbets,"You're welcome, many helped!"
2021-04-13 12:57:32,wallstreetbets,Hmm. Reddit hug of death?
2021-04-13 13:10:18,wallstreetbets,"Good to hear, I think they might be better if more people used the exchange.  Seems they may be prone to half filled orders, which could just be because not many route through them."
2021-04-13 13:11:45,wallstreetbets,I did write it in the context of GME.  You are right that the issue is broader though.  Dark Pools are used in general to manipulate trades and choosing to route outside of them can help protect your investment.
2021-04-13 13:42:51,wallstreetbets,Not sure why I would want that.
2021-04-13 07:40:16,wallstreetbets,Welcome
2021-04-13 08:10:20,wallstreetbets,"Not ""smart"" for you, lol."
2021-04-13 08:39:21,wallstreetbets,"No, I have links to the list Fidelity allows with descriptions of each.

Their default uses Dark Pools.  I would think sending it to NYSE directly would be better than that."
2021-04-12 22:39:17,wallstreetbets,"I don't think every tweet is a message, but I legit don't think he is allowed to talk to anyone any more.  Some of his tweets probably are commentary."
2021-04-13 11:36:59,wallstreetbets,"Not wanting to defend the QAnon-ness of this, but if he is being investigated for anything, his lawyers would probably tell him to not tweet about things related to those investigators."
2021-04-13 07:41:46,wallstreetbets,"np dude, just trying to help the cause."
2021-04-13 08:09:57,wallstreetbets,"Don't know, sorry."
2021-04-13 08:35:49,wallstreetbets,"Yes, IEX is an exchange, like the NYSE, it's where orders go to be filled.  Why would Citadel and co, not trade there?  They just don't get as much of an advantage due to the intentional delay."
2021-04-12 22:29:34,wallstreetbets,More than you think.
2021-04-12 22:25:08,wallstreetbets,"I bought more last Friday.

Also if it's true that GME buy orders are being routed to the Dark Pool, then that is why our buying is having no effect on the price."
2021-04-13 07:38:56,wallstreetbets,I feel fine lol.
2021-04-13 04:21:44,wallstreetbets,"People have speculated on his tweets as long as he's been making them.

Even if that wasn't what he meant, using IEX isn't a bad move, they aim to level the playing field for retail.  It's their mandate."
2021-04-13 07:42:39,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-04-13 11:38:46,wallstreetbets,"What? You would send your money into the lion's den, because the lions would give you preferential treatment? I'm not following your logic here."
2021-04-13 11:37:51,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't transfer at this point.  Even ETrade seems to have this locked behind their Pro account requirements.
2021-04-13 11:58:27,wallstreetbets,"Don't know what ""Sell"" means..."
2021-04-13 11:32:01,wallstreetbets,Doesn't seem like it.
2021-04-13 11:30:49,wallstreetbets,Probably to prevent legal issues.
2021-04-13 10:16:16,wallstreetbets,"Also, want to know how to do this through Schwab."
2021-04-13 11:27:25,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I got excited about the coincidences.  I do think DFV is giving some commentary.  I tried to word it in a way that suggests possible reference, not absolute."
2021-04-13 11:26:32,wallstreetbets,Nice!
2021-04-13 11:26:27,wallstreetbets,Nice!
2021-04-13 11:25:50,wallstreetbets,They may not allow manual routing.
2021-04-13 11:27:54,wallstreetbets,"Cashapp sucks. I was on it for a while because of the convenience. I wrote to support to ask how to transfer my shares to Fidelity, to find out who the brokerage was (it's listed as a Cashapp owned brokerage, but I don't know why it's called something like DriveWealth), and the response about whether my shares were on margin seemed to be a ""yeah, probably"". If you transfer out, you can never trade on Cashapp again (oh no!!).

That's all I've got for you, though. Wish I could be of more help."
2021-04-13 11:25:32,wallstreetbets,Should work in general.
2021-04-13 10:29:19,wallstreetbets,/u/Syvaeren This might be good info to add to your post for us Fidelity users.

2021-04-13 11:40:28,wallstreetbets,"IEX is an exchange, like the NYSE, of course Citadel is going to use it to trade on, why would they limit themselves.  They have a disadvantage to trading on there due to the ""speed bump""."
2021-04-13 11:44:40,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I read about D-Limit orders yesterday and was really excited.  The ""Crumbling Quote"" feature, paired with an AI algo embedded in the exchange, is designed to protect retail investors generally at the mercy of advanced tech from the Citadels of the world."

HFTs that do Market Making buy your orders at NBBO price (or better) in order to sell them at a *later* time. You will never get a better price by changing what exchange it lists at, if anything you'll miss the BBO due to unnecessary routing."
2021-04-13 08:10:28,wallstreetbets,The Sting shows this concept very well.
2021-04-13 11:03:06,wallstreetbets,"In at least one circumstance, it creates a system where literally exactly 1 company has access to it.  I don't recall who did it, but someone took advantage of the fact that the speed of light through air is faster than the speed of light through fiber optic cable and setup a chain of line-of-sight towers with microwave transmitters all the way from NYC to Chicago.  A signal to update a price goes faster through the towers than through the cables that actual market infrastructure uses, leading to zero-risk arbitrage.  Just generates automatic money no matter what happens."

2021-04-12 22:45:20,wallstreetbets,"This is a pretty good article: https://iextrading.com/about/press/op-ed/

You can also read this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/22moq9/iex_speed_bump/

TL;DR: IEX imposes a 350 microsecond delay on all orders (a speed bump if you will) that is supposed to prevent scalping / latency arbitrage.

It's a pretty fascinating rabbit hole to go down IMO."
2021-04-13 07:44:56,wallstreetbets,"Watch the hummingbird project movie.  HFT are able to do what they do if they have the quickest path possible to sending information to exchanges. That's why trillions of dollars in trades are actually in NJ and not on Wall street.  The IEX levels the playing field for everyone because it coils wires to its exchange thereby negating any advantage HFT have for simply having a fast computer/connection. IEX essentially just artificially increases the distance of sending information to its exchange. 

You can see the fuckery with HFT. Ever try sending a limit order in for an option right at the midpoint of the spread and not see it fill and see the spread instantly change when you hit the send order button?  That's HFT eating up the contracts available because they can see your order and cut in front of you to grab any available option for the limit price you set.  That means the bid ask increases and the Hft profit off the increased spread and you get fucked having to pay more.  At the IEX, the power of HFT to do that is basically negated because the IEX has slowed them down."

If you're going to get a better price on the exchange (I e: if the exchange's price has somehow been artificially suppressed) then your order goes there (if your broker isn't ass). Price pressure gets distributed between the two, you can't route all buys to one and all sells to the other (ignoring the fact that you literally can't do this because every trade needs one of each) to manipulate it because everybody else will see the better deal on the exchange and route it there instead."

2021-04-12 22:35:43,wallstreetbets,"I have to ask, but have you actually paid attention to anything outside the gme posts and threads? gme positive consensus in general is rapidly declining. negative opinions used to be non existent or immediately downvoted to hell. now I'm starting to see actually discussions about how the poor gme apes are basically a cult of idiots being taken advantage of by the hedgefunds they think they are fighting. Now those discussions dont matter of course, the only thing that matters is that the trend is changing.  also, I highly doubt the price would be as volatile as it is if everyone was ""diamond handing"" to their grave like yall claim you are."
2021-04-12 22:59:02,wallstreetbets,No. Trading in dark pools “effects the price.” Dark pool trades print on the consolidated tape. You guys have a different conspiracy theory every week.

2021-04-12 22:27:24,wallstreetbets,"good for you 👏 hope your not to deep in the red.

also, you really think that all buy orders are being routed into the ether  as to prevent the price going up? if that's true then forget market manipulation and short laddering, you apes are fucked..."
2021-04-13 02:50:05,wallstreetbets,"The reason why the price is not going up is because when you look at the frickin Level 2 data, there are very few people buying and selling. The spike and dumps in middle of the day, is likely a big player buying shares and options and flipping them quickly trying to see if they can make a quick buck (perhaps hoping to get Apes to jump on board and buy driving the price up long enough for them to unload the shares and options at a profit... does not look like it worked much because apparently Apes are all broke and can't really buy more shares)."

2021-04-13 11:23:33,wallstreetbets,Not saying it was about better price. It was about preventing them from filling in the Dark Pool which doesn't affect market price.

edit: i had to go thru the TDA site (instead of the app) and put an order thru the stocks & ETFs page for it to show the routing option set to IEX, instead of using the buy/sell button on the GME page which just uses SnapTicket with Smart routing. hopefully someone else can chime in with a simpler method...?"

2021-04-13 14:53:55,wallstreetbets,"It's a bit of a stretch to say dark pool fills don't affect the market price. The trades end up on the consolidated tape eventually. So they do affect market price. They just don't participate in NBBO so they don't affect the market price immediately.

I'm not so sure that dark pools with price discovery are contributing to any ""false pricing"" in the public markets.

Note that the MM's don't need dark pools to front run Robinhood traders. They use public exchanges, ECNs and dark pools to do that. They can even use IEX to front run Robinhood traders."

He's a deep value investor, he likely has no idea how the intricacies of dark pools and routing through the IEX works.

Hell, he literally tweeted a few weeks ago alluding to people reading into his tweets too much and that he's just having fun with it: https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1371888212055052294?s=19"

I have no money at risk. Pricing inefficiencies and differences allow me to make a fixed profit, no matter the direction of the stock. UVXY is a perfect choice for box spreads, as it has a predictable chart and steadily goes up as time passes.

I plan on buying 2 - 4k contracts that all expire 1 year from now.

It is 100% risk-free. I have no money at risk.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Alibaba almost sold on Friday. Took this screen shot after I had already sold half of the options this morning. 
2021-04-12 22:09:44,wallstreetbets,Why can’t my ape hands randomly tap buttons & get these results! Guess it’s the smooth brain 🧠
2021-04-12 22:10:37,wallstreetbets,Why did you sell. Baba is on a rocket ship now that a big chunk of uncertainty is out of their business.  Bet it will go up 10% more in next week or two which will make those worth a ton more.
2021-04-12 21:29:53,wallstreetbets,"I got lucky, was playing a swing between $222 and $235, Friday afternoon i bought 9,  4-16 $225 strike calls for $3.25 when underlying was $222.75.  Still holding at $19.80, pure luck getting an outsized swing!"
2021-04-12 21:55:36,wallstreetbets,Cafu.
2021-04-13 00:41:58,wallstreetbets,Hitting 300 again in no time
2021-04-12 21:38:41,wallstreetbets,Jack Ma thanks you
2021-04-12 21:57:43,wallstreetbets,Noice
2021-04-12 23:27:36,wallstreetbets,Congrats. And fuck you.
2021-04-13 01:50:38,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you
2021-04-13 14:12:00,wallstreetbets,What app dis
2021-04-12 23:30:22,wallstreetbets,"So basically we are funding the Chinese war against the US by buying this. Tensions are getting worse and worse, I wonder if the US will fast track delisting of Chinese companies because of the shit that just happened in the South China Sea"
2021-04-13 05:44:17,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-04-12 22:20:49,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Already slightly ITM and will probably be deep ITM going into next week. Can’t fault OP for taking some profits, but these will print. I’m buying until I reach 100 shares. Currently, 48 shares @ $231."
2021-04-13 11:10:00,wallstreetbets,"If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to lock in gains.  Neither you, OP, or anybody can say with certainty which way baba will trade."
2021-04-13 01:49:21,wallstreetbets,"Bet it won’t. Always lock in some profits after a crazy spike.

Don’t screenshot me again. lol"
2021-04-13 02:11:11,wallstreetbets,"Huh.  Anyone owning the company stock or calls is making money.  

Take you political bs somewhere else.  I bet there is a reddit where someone else cares.  Not this one."
2021-04-12 23:03:41,wallstreetbets,I sold my deep ITM and bought atm calls with 1/4th of the profit. Gives me the same leverage as if I held half my position. I cant imagine holding deep ITM on something like baba where random news will make your $20 premium calls worthless overnight. Ill take the theta decay instead
2021-04-13 10:08:33,wallstreetbets,"I’ve done a few dcfs on BABA with values between $600-1000. I’m long this stock. This analysis should probably be in r/investing instead of r/wsb. I’m not your typical smooth 
-brained 🦍."
2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I’M NOT FUCKING LEAVING!!!!!!! 
2021-04-12 22:10:57,wallstreetbets,I DEMAND A REFUND

2021-04-12 22:00:43,wallstreetbets,Sure you are .. on 4/30
2021-04-13 00:35:00,wallstreetbets,You only need the price to go up 400% to break even...
2021-04-12 22:41:05,wallstreetbets,"IV already killed you lol, theta next. gl fellow ape

ps. Buy shares"
2021-04-12 20:52:54,wallstreetbets,Lambos or food stamps?
2021-04-12 20:57:28,wallstreetbets,"OP wants validation , and expects us to cheer him up. 👏👏👏👏👏 well done for wasting almost $18Kn...."
2021-04-12 21:34:02,wallstreetbets,"""17k for 1 option?? bro say less"" ..... you fucking idiot lmaooooooooooooooooooooooo"
2021-04-12 20:41:45,wallstreetbets,Attaboy!
2021-04-12 21:30:53,wallstreetbets,You are stupid... and hoping that other idiots reinforce and encourage your stupidity... bring on the downvotes
2021-04-12 22:17:31,wallstreetbets,Can sell and buy a safer July 16 my man.
2021-04-12 23:25:03,wallstreetbets,"Even though it feels better being resolute about never leaving, I would consider the option of closing out that position (for a loss obviously) in order to use the proceeds to open a new position with a further out date and (most importantly) an ITM strike"
2021-04-13 04:04:36,wallstreetbets,You won’t be able to afford a Uber home. That’s why you not leaving
2021-04-12 21:06:15,wallstreetbets,Bankrupt or Bugatti’s babyyyyyyy
2021-04-13 01:03:02,wallstreetbets,"Damn. shout out to the seller, made the easiest 17k ever lol. Jokes aside Godspeed retard cuz you really are, I hope you at least make your money back"
2021-04-13 03:39:06,wallstreetbets,You're Money is leaving!
2021-04-12 23:08:12,wallstreetbets,OP it's your money. Protect it. No one here cares if you are leaving it staying. GME not going up after CEO search news is concerning.
2021-04-12 22:25:22,wallstreetbets,Back in 2016-17 my best bud got a Rh acct account. He used margin. He lost everything within 6 months. He also owed the -IRS- quite a few ten-dies
2021-04-12 21:55:21,wallstreetbets,"Man, if you had played a vertical spread you would have only lost a fraction of that. I’ve been there before too buddy. If you’re not familiar, check your resources and try it out on the next run"
2021-04-12 22:41:11,wallstreetbets,GME going under 100 this week
2021-04-12 21:21:01,wallstreetbets,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

2021-04-12 22:07:08,wallstreetbets,Of course you're not. Selling at a loss is for retards
2021-04-12 20:44:56,wallstreetbets,Be careful and he aware with RH! They messed things up once and will do it again to save themselves
2021-04-12 20:44:45,wallstreetbets,Hell naw
2021-04-12 21:11:00,wallstreetbets,"I'd tell you to sell out of this pyramid scheme and put into a real stock like pltr, but at this point I guess it doesn't matter lmao"
2021-04-12 22:43:36,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-13 04:18:50,wallstreetbets,"My hands have never been more diamond, my dear ape brethren.

2021-04-12 22:23:25,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-12 20:49:00,wallstreetbets,Should I sell it now?
2021-04-12 22:21:44,wallstreetbets,I remember back in like 2016 or 2017 my best bud starting using RH & didn’t understand options. He lost everything. Then owned the IRS.
2021-04-12 21:43:26,wallstreetbets,"Please sell and just atm calls, you will at least make some back"
2021-04-12 23:51:31,wallstreetbets,I wanna say this is not the way.. but I’m holding so what do I know.
2021-04-13 01:12:50,wallstreetbets,"At least you can say you had $17,000, no one can take that from you"
2021-04-13 01:34:58,wallstreetbets,What’s the strike
2021-04-13 02:06:37,wallstreetbets,"Well your money sure is.

You can either salvage $3k right now, or watch it disappear to nothing in 17 days. You’re leaving whether you want to or not, lmao.."
2021-04-13 02:33:30,wallstreetbets,no but your money has already left your pocket
2021-04-13 02:48:25,wallstreetbets,Lol at that expiration date and break even price. What a retard.

2021-04-13 10:23:36,wallstreetbets,Just had a little precum leak out
2021-04-13 10:24:30,wallstreetbets,"Sheesh, the guy selling 17k options must be fucking wives rn"
2021-04-13 10:34:32,wallstreetbets,"Dude damn, how do you see a contract that’s not a leap and pay that much for it? At that point you should have just bought tsla leaps or spy leaps"
2021-04-13 11:34:33,wallstreetbets,You really should leave Robinhood though.
2021-04-13 13:05:29,wallstreetbets,See that red dot down there. That's GME's lawyer with a restraining order.
2021-04-13 17:32:08,wallstreetbets,Hope from gme and not from Robinhood. You should transfer ASAP on fidelity
2021-04-13 18:46:48,wallstreetbets,You will be on 4/30
2021-04-12 22:53:28,wallstreetbets,I am not leaving never either we have a squeeze or to 0.
2021-04-13 01:50:19,wallstreetbets,Re tar dead
2021-04-13 02:42:01,wallstreetbets,What app is this?
2021-04-13 11:19:57,wallstreetbets,"You don’t have to go home 

But you can’t stay here"
2021-04-13 12:34:57,wallstreetbets,"NOT SELLING options? OK, I guess they'll expire worthless."
2021-04-13 14:25:28,wallstreetbets,"If the plan was to lose, you are doing great!"
2021-04-13 03:00:39,wallstreetbets,I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY
2021-04-12 22:11:34,wallstreetbets,EXACTLY what I was thinking
2021-04-13 08:07:14,wallstreetbets,Old screenshot. His contract is worth about $500 now
2021-04-13 01:35:39,wallstreetbets,This is a casino dickweed let the man live
2021-04-12 20:45:58,wallstreetbets,"I bought shares and calls. I'll sell and buy back calls, not shares. Option decay is retarded but a reality.


Edit: I don't think you guys get what I meant. I'll flip my options but not my shares. I don't sell my shares 🤷"
2021-04-13 01:02:04,wallstreetbets,"My dumbass bests this, during the squeeze, rolled 1/29 200c's into the next week $200c after they shut off buying shares, ended up with a loss of more than $20k for the contract. Expired worthless. Debated posting my loss porn"
2021-04-13 04:38:53,wallstreetbets,"So I know nothing about options and probably will never use them, but where do you get the $17k price for what he bought? I don’t see thag number anywhere in the SS"
2021-04-13 01:10:18,wallstreetbets,This guy at least has a chance not like that actual retard who bought 90k worth of calls 1DTE
2021-04-13 00:57:10,wallstreetbets,Again let this be another lesson to all of you to buy shares instead what the fuck are you doing buying options
2021-04-13 00:37:37,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂
2021-04-12 20:53:25,wallstreetbets,Been on food stamps my whole life. I didn’t know there was another way
2021-04-12 21:02:05,wallstreetbets,Very thankful for the opportunity to have a huge write off against gains taken tbh but yes cheer little minion cheer this mistake lol
2021-04-13 11:23:09,wallstreetbets,"I mean good chance it was an autist who sold the call

OP is just a retard"
2021-04-13 00:22:59,wallstreetbets,Lmfaooo
2021-04-12 21:38:06,wallstreetbets,You are not wrong
2021-04-13 00:05:28,wallstreetbets,"The biggest winners in this whole charade are market makers who sold $800 call contracts for shit ton of money a month ago. Not just $800 any contract above 400 sp made them so much money. Those of you who bought shares below hundred could have made money selling contracts....

End of the day smart folks take advantage of us common folk and make money..."
2021-04-13 00:07:14,wallstreetbets,"It all seems as if this is fully engineered to hold value and decay slowly so that both call and put contracts expired out of money and made money for those who sold them...

Of course I was stupid too... apologies for being harsh.."
2021-04-13 03:42:39,wallstreetbets,"GME doesn’t go up on positive news. Only
🍦🐸 make it go brrrr"
2021-04-12 22:54:23,wallstreetbets,He should have uninstall the app 😂

2021-04-13 00:21:51,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah more discounts?
2021-04-13 02:24:40,wallstreetbets,Back it up and throw some puts on it then.
2021-04-13 02:28:06,wallstreetbets,Letting $17k worth of option expire is genius though.
2021-04-12 21:14:58,wallstreetbets,Do they even hve the market share to pull that off anymore?  Platform is dead compared to where it was in jan.
2021-04-13 13:15:13,wallstreetbets,"Lmao is this satire? Invest in a real company, like Herbalife. Palantir is a worse actual investment than the actual company of GME without the short."

2021-04-12 21:04:08,wallstreetbets,"Let it expire worthless lmao

Or cash it out and give me some money so I can show you what gains look like"

2021-04-13 06:18:56,wallstreetbets,I felt robbed of all the loss porn I knew was out there that week. Greedy mofos keeping it to themselves
2021-04-13 05:29:03,wallstreetbets,"Average cost 176. Each contract has 100 shares so 100x176= $17,600. you can also see it in his total return amount plus total equity amount"

2021-04-12 20:33:59,wallstreetbets,"How can you even purchase a call so far ahead? 9/17?

Edit(couple seconds after): nvm stupid question"
2021-04-12 21:43:15,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao Ford has never been $15, why would it go $15 now?"
2021-04-12 23:57:46,wallstreetbets,Not sure if F has the ability to compete with the EV market.  I can see them using other manufacturers parts to franken produce reliable cool products thougha

2021-04-13 03:18:51,wallstreetbets,THis is retarded
2021-04-13 13:56:15,wallstreetbets,Lol F moves so little
2021-04-12 22:01:24,wallstreetbets,Lol I hope so. I think they are an underrated company that has potential for a big comeback.
2021-04-12 21:31:22,wallstreetbets,It’s mainly because their huge billion dollar investments in China imploded with nobody in China wanting to buy a Ford. Then they released their electric versions that nobody is buying as well. So long term this company is headed for trouble.
2021-04-12 20:29:14,wallstreetbets,.
2021-04-12 20:32:16,wallstreetbets,I have seen quite a few around where I live.
2021-04-12 20:23:18,wallstreetbets,The demand is pretty high. I think the big thing that might screw things up is if they can’t get the chip shortage under control.
2021-04-12 21:27:24,wallstreetbets,No. It’s barley selling. If it was actually selling well they would be selling it $20k over sticker instead of offering discounts. Similar to how overpriced they sold the Raptor and Shelby after new releases.
2021-04-13 16:28:16,wallstreetbets,What are some of the selling points for the Mach E compared to a Tesla?  Maybe some people  like the body design more.  What else is there?  Serious question.
2021-04-13 04:03:10,wallstreetbets,Ending dividends is step one for any boomer stock to actually go up no need to pay out billions each quarter to have shareholders
2021-04-12 21:45:55,wallstreetbets,That’s not true. They were over $40 in the late 90s (Lol it’s definitely a long time ago). Not saying that’s an indicator of its potential but I’m betting on the Mach E eating into Tesla’s market cap and I suspect as chips come back Ford may have a shot at a massive comeback.
2021-04-13 01:52:53,wallstreetbets,The electric F150 might be a big winner but I’m not betting on it.
2021-04-13 03:19:39,wallstreetbets,Too overrated still. THey have no future
2021-04-12 20:43:25,wallstreetbets,Same here seen two so far.. the blue one is a beauty
2021-04-12 21:25:40,wallstreetbets,"Yup I work for Ford at one of the major factory’s, we’re gonna be laid off the last two weeks of May."
2021-04-12 20:43:01,wallstreetbets,They didn’t make their own chip?
2021-04-13 16:40:13,wallstreetbets,Mach E buyers will be able to get the Federal Tax credit. Can’t think of any other than that. I don’t like the fact that Ford make it 4 different trim to get the certain feature. I personally prefer Tesla due to nationwide superchargers and Autopilot.
2021-04-12 21:47:54,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-13 03:27:04,wallstreetbets,They will cost a fortune when first released and won't be affordable for many years after. I'd give it at least 8 years before the electric F150 can compete with the gas version.
2021-04-13 01:59:48,wallstreetbets,I dont think it'll be the saving grace. No manufacturer other than tesla has the ability to mass produce EV'S right now. Especially at the quality and reliability level you'd demand from a vehicle in that price range. Tesla ownes (or is heavily invested in) everything from pulling raw materials from the ground to battery manufacturing to sending the car to your door. Ford and other legacy autos have to outsource so much of that supply line.
2021-04-12 22:15:31,wallstreetbets,"^Psst
You in Louisville too?"
2021-04-12 20:44:07,wallstreetbets,Maybe some but they just shut down a factory because of the chip shortage. Idk if it impacted the Mach e though
2021-04-13 16:50:55,wallstreetbets,I wonder how the repair process is with the Mach E?  Seems that some people have a lengthy wait time with Tesla.  A little later down the road I’m sure this issue will be resolved.
2021-04-12 21:48:57,wallstreetbets,Ya but by that logic Tesla should be around $30 a share so I figure anything is possible
2021-04-12 22:26:28,wallstreetbets,You've never heard of a mustang?
2021-04-13 00:58:29,wallstreetbets,Yessir! Ktp
2021-04-13 17:06:42,wallstreetbets,"No idea lol. Tesla been having that problem for years I think later on third party body shop will start doing repair for Tesla. 

Ford might be to do that easily though"

(Oh, are you saying you’ll be laid off for 2 weeks?)"
2021-04-13 03:24:39,wallstreetbets,I bought an F150 made at your factory just a few months ago.
2021-04-12 22:38:59,wallstreetbets,Lol.
2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My Update on UWMC: The Equivalent of Counting Cards at the Blackjack Table Baby, or Why are ya'll tripping on this fine Stock? So, I wanted to wait a period of time before writing a update to my due diligence. Some of you might remember my last two due diligences. Well, I’m happy to say that I’ve bought more. So, let’s actually get to the meat and potatoes.  If you want some theme music for how some of you people with a bad case of FUD who are holding UWMC are feeling I'd recommend Balduin & Wolfgang Lohr - Dizzy (ft. Alanna). Bonus points if you know the anime/light novel and get the meta meme within.

Please note that this is based on historical monthly median single family home values in the US, that the data is non-seasonally adjusted, and that it is based on sales of existing homes.

· The Median Home Price was $303,900 in January.

· The Median Home Price was $317,100 in February.

· In February, the supply of inventory ticked up by .1 to 2 Months indicating huge demand, and an extreme sellers-market, indicating that home prices will have increased when data in March 2021 is shed on the 25th.

If you would like to do some more research, you can find the NAR data here: [Housing Statistics (nar.realtor)](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics).

While it is true that existing home sales fell, it is not due to a bubble, but due to supply constraints and unrestrained demand. What you can be assured of however is five things, for Q1 of 2021:

1. On a seasonally adjusted basis, home sales have increased as you can see in the NAR data. Furthermore, the per home sale profit has increased due to month-on-month price increases. This is because originations usually cost .5-1% of a home’s value. With UWMC’s increasing margin due to its technology, gain margin should continue, and has been shown to have grown YoY.
2. UWMC has put out guidance of between $52 Billion and $57 of closed loan volume. Last quarter they had $54.7 Billion in 4Q20. On the Mad Money Interview with Cramer, the man said they were on track to land right around the middle of that. That provides, impetus for me to believe they will meet, or exceed guidance. They had Net Income of $1,001,925,000 after the impact of an estimated effective tax rate of 27% in Q4 of 2020. Total Gain Margin may be a little lower, as they are stating they will have a gain margin of 200-235 Basis Points, as opposed to 305 Basis Points in Q4 2020.
3. It is important to know that while they do refinance, their bread and butter is and always has been the purchase market. However, in 2020, however, they turned off FHA loans, and Jumbo loans out of an abundance of caution. This meant that while they made a massive $3.38 Billion in net income, their actual purchase volume decreased to $42.9 Billion, as compared to $49.8 Billion in total purchase volume in FY19. As UWMC has returned to doing these offerings, we can expect purchase volume to increase, and offset refinance volume (which is still going very strong, even if it is lower YoY).
4. As mortgage rates increased, they remained far below the 2019 Interest Rate, and have recently ticked down. Furthermore, UWMC’s rates compared to retail are 15 basis points better (.15%), which equates to roughly $28 in savings per month for consumers. Furthermore, selling a home takes a median of 25 days (the fastest rate ever), and down from 40 days the year before). Moreover, 46% of properties went under contract within a single week and 59% did so within two weeks. However, the time to close is extremely high for Mortgage companies and the average is 58 days on average. However, UWMC’s is 18 days, and it was 16 in December (whereas competitors time to close increased. The Broker Channel is faster, and cheaper, for consumers and that should scale well as the wholesale market continues to take market share generally.
5. Their issuance of a 700-Million-dollar senior note with a 5.5% interest rate to pay off an MSR facility, and for general corporate purposes is a bullish sign as it indicates to me they are experiencing heavy volume and want to grab as much market share as possible.

Going Forward:

1. The sale of lots, and the issuance of permits is red hot, and you can start seeing a lot more inventory coming online later in 2021 and throughout 2022. Furthermore, demand going forward should still be strong for a few years at minimum (if, probably, lower than 2020-2021).
2. “The population of 25- to 34-year-olds is 9% larger than the 35- to 44-year-old group, signaling to homebuilders that a wave of demand is on the horizon. The bank's modeling suggests monthly housing starts will land between 1.7 million and 2 million through 2024, markedly higher than the February reading of 1.4 million.” – Straight from the Jeffrey’s Analyst here ([4 Reasons Jefferies Sees Long and Sustainable Boom in US Housing (businessinsider.com)](https://www.businessinsider.com/housing-market-sustainable-boom-homebuyers-mortgage-rates-millennials-construction-jefferies-2021-4) à I’m not going to mention the other points brought here.
3. Mortgage Servicing Rights, which UWMC has been acquiring more and more of will act as a hedge against higher inflation rates, and will also serve as a source of steady cash flow through good times and time when the housing market is slower. Considering the delinquency rate for applicants for UWMC is far lower than the average, due to their high FICO scores, this means that UWMC is well positioned.

However, this is not what I wanted to discuss. I wanted to discuss the share price, and the fact that the chances of UWMC issuing a stock buyback, issuing a special dividend, and/or increasing the dividend are extremely likely. Not least of all, because he said that they were looking to do so if there was excess cash, and it looks very likely that there will be. You can find their CEO talking about it on the Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript (Page 6 if I recall), or you can just listen to it all.

**The Stock Buyback**

Please remember the stock buyback authorization lets the company take advantage and buy at any time within a period. I also know that the price will go up on the declaration of earnings and a buyback, but I want to show some wicked math.

Before we look at a buyback, we should look at how much the annual dividend of .40 (A dividend Yield of 5.32%!), costs the company and if it is able to service its dividend and debts well. The annual dividend comes at around 640 Million, while the 1.5B of Senior Notes comes in at 82.5 Million in interest per year. The sum, therefore, is $722,500,000 that UWMC needs to pay out to shareholders, and to bondholders. Considering the first quarter alone will not only pay all that but leave around $300 Million, or more, in profit we can safely say that the dividend payout ratio is safe and that UWMC can easily service its debts.

However, perhaps you can see something here that I see? That is right. The dividend yield is almost as high as the interest rate on these senior notes. Stock buybacks are usually issued to increase prices, but also to improve earnings per share because the share count is decreased. **However,** I much prefer when they are issued on high yield dividend stocks and I will explain why here. This is because while it simultaneously increases earnings per share, it also substantially improves cash flow and profit and helps lower the share payout ratio. It does not matter if they are public float shares, or control shares, when it has a dividend. Either way your profit

Let us do some paper math. UWMC has 1.6 Billion in shares (all inclusive), and a market cap of 12.05 Billion. They have 1.5 Billion in Senior Notes with an interest rate of 5.5%. Let us just go ahead and say that they wanted to do a share buyback of 1.5 Billion (I think this is too high, but I am conveying a point here). That would be 12.4% of all Shares in UWMC. If all these shares were purchased at exactly $7.50, that would equate to exactly 200 Million Shares. 200 Million Shares times the dividend yield (40 Cents!), is equivalent to 80 Million Dollars.

Therefore, between now and 2025, the interest payments on the 1.5 Billion Dollar in Senior Notes will be essentially paid off by the stock buyback. Furthermore, after 2025 there will only be the 700 Million Senior Note left, which means that there will only be interest payments of 38.5 Million per year until 2029 when the Senior Note is Due. That means that between 2025 and 2029, 166 Million will have been saved up and can be utilized to help pay 2029’s Senior Note’s Principal. From 2021 to 2029 UWMC will have saved up 640 Million that it otherwise would have had to pay over that 8-year period. Over a 10 YR period it will save 800 Million.

As the share price climbs lower (Yes, intended to say climb lower ha-ha because I like buying this cheap), it becomes more and more likely that UWMC is compelled to issue a share buyback as the dividend yield would surpass the senior notes interest & could lead to very significant savings.

However….

**The Stock Buy Back + Dividend Raise Trick**

If UWMC felt extremely bullish, and simultaneously wanted to indicate the markets needed to take it a lot more seriously it could do this sleight of hand. As it decreased the share count, and thus the annual yield by 12.5%, it could raise the dividend by 12.5% to 45 Cents. This would increase your annual dividend yield from 5.32% to 6% while simultaneously increasing EPS.

**Plus, a Special Dividend?**

I personally would rather they reinvest the money in the company than do a special dividend, but they have a fortress of a balance sheet with a good cash balance and equity, and strong free cash flow so…. They could declare a special dividend of .41-.42 cents, which is equivalent to Rocket’s 5.5% Special Dividend. Considering they made around $3.38 in net income last year, they could issue a stock buyback of 1.5Billion, pay the raised 640 Million annual dividend of .45, and do a special dividend costing another 640 Million. That would total 2.78B, leaving them with some profit for the year to put this in perspective. Considering taxes, they probably would be in the red by around 285 Million. Considering their strong cash reserves, they could do it however, but it is not something I’d do (at least with such a high special dividend). HOWEVER, I’d prefer they reinvest the money into new technology and growing market share than a special dividend as they own 35% of the wholesale broker channel’s market share and want to expand that to 50%.

**This Stock Will Pay You to Hold It on Margin**

Depending on your Brokerage, this stock will pay you to hold it. Robinhood Gold gives you the first 1,000 margin free, and thereafter 2.5% annual. IBKR starts at 1.59% and goes down from there.

Let us say you are placing $1000 on margin, and the annual interest rate is 2.5%. That means you pay 25 dollars in yearly interest. That is .068 cents a day. At 7.50, you can purchase 133.333 UWMC shares. That equates to $53.33 per year. A $28.33 profit.

Now, to have a paper loss the share price would need to decrease by 21 cents to $7.29. However, remember that the yield is making you money regardless, and if you believe it will go up long term you do not care. Where this matters however is collateral, or how much you need in your brokerage. I am extremely well capitalized on my utilization of margin so that the company would have to go bankrupt (go to 0) or near enough to it, before I would have to shift money around to make sure I am not margin called. Everyone has their risk tolerance. If you decide to make a play like this, you should know yours and work towards a allocation that is comfortable for you.

**The Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt**

There has been a lot of bemoaning regarding UWMC, and I can say it has felt a little bit like being DeepFuckingValue here before GME mooned. It has gotten to the point where someone gloatingly asked if I had sold yet like 1-2 weeks after I had posted a DD, and I told them I had bought more instead after it went down further.

I do not care about a daily return, or weekly returns. That is not to mean I do not do them on occasion, but there is such a thing as MoM returns. Especially if it is compounding. Say you have $50,000 last month invested in one stock. Next month, you sell for a 67 percent profit and now have $83,500. That is a month-on-month profit of 33.5%. You repeat that exact same scenario with $83,500, and that turns into $139,445. So over four months, through compounding, your total return is 278.98% for a 4-month period on your initial $50,000.

The only catalysts I care about are on May 5th, and May 7th. May 5th for Earnings, and May 7 because it is the Russel inclusion list for June Reconstitution. While I don’t really care about the Russel bump, for some reason some people seem to, and I can appreciate the fact that liquidity would increase as volume has been thin recently.

Let me be clear, I do not care if it goes down between now and then, and in point of fact, I **want** it to because I can keep averaging down and increase my MoM average. I bought more today. And if it goes down again, I’ll keep buying.

The only thing I care about is Forward EPS, and Dividend Payout Ratio. The Analysts think that the EPS FY 2021 will be 1.42. I know that is wrong, and outdated, because they expect only .4 in Q1 2021, and that goes against UWMC guidance completely. Let us say, conservatively, that they make 1 Billion in Net Income after taxes… 1B Net Income/1.6 Billion Shares=.625 EPS for Q1 2021. 800 Million in Net Income/1.6 Billion Shares=.5 EPS for Q1 2021. Regardless, I will just go ahead and state that .4 is fine. That quarter alone will pay off the dividend for the full year under the dividend payout ratio. The FY 1.42 Analyst Expectations (Which is wrong and potentially outdated?), means that the dividend payout ratio is 27.2% which is a very, very, good ratio. The Nasdaq Website shows the Forward P/E at 5.47 on the future EPS of 1.4. However, I believe that EPS for FY 2021 will be roughly around 2-2.22, which gives a forward P/E ratio of 3.75 to 3.378.

At the end of the day, because of this, I have peace of mind to say I want to buy more if it goes to 7, 6, or 5 before earnings. My thought process is “Oh, a dividend yield of 5.7/6.67/8 percent, with a payout ratio of 27.2% at absolutely MINIMUM, and a payout ratio of 20% or less of -my- calculations? SWEET! Oh, and this share price means they HAVE to do a stock buyback because they save so much fucking money. Fucking WOOHOO!” Furthermore, the company in its first quarter alone is going to earn 1/12th of its market cap in profit roughly, and it is based on its own guidance. So, yes, I want the price to go down. Because I know it’ll go up to its fair value, and my MoM will increase the further down I average.

Wall Street Bets likes to think the market is a casino like experience. We have our weekly slots players buying weekly calls/puts, and our momentum/swing traders doing the equivalent of playing roulette. But then there are the people like me, deep value investors, who heads straight to the blackjack table, and then counts. And the best part of it is, it is legal. I look at this stock, and I see one of the easiest deep value buys I will ever make. I don’t care about the journey, since I know where the destination is. I **like the stock**.

But do not look at me, look at today at around 5. That is when a dark money buyer bought a huge tranche of shares and the share price went from -.20 to +.41. I checked the order book, and the sell orders from 7.61 to 7.92 were all there, which meant they had not bought from the public. Some guy bought a fuck ton of shares.

My Position: 4,358 Shares averaged at around $8.06, $6 Calls May/21, $7.5 May 21.

**This is not financial advice, I just love the stock.**

**TLDR:** Wall Street Bets likes to think the market is a casino like experience. We have our weekly slots players buying weekly calls/puts, and our momentum/swing traders doing the equivalent of playing roulette. But then there are the people like me, deep value investors, who heads straight to the blackjack table, and then count. And the best part of it is, it is legal.

&#x200B;

IMPORTANT EDIT: A commenter somewhere else told me that the dividend is only for shareholders of Class A shares and not Class D (SFS Corp which the owners own). I mistakenly assumed that it was for holders of all common stock. Therefore, the actual dividend is only 41.3 Million which means stockholder's equity grows much more vastly than otherwise indicated. With that said if you go to the 10-K on page 49 you can see that every single share of Class D stock can be exchanged for Class A stock. Also the stock based compensation of people can be seen in the SEC filing on the UWMC investor relations site. This means a stock buyback can still be done, but it might not be the slam dunk proposition i had thought and that a much higher dividend than I had thought, or a huge special dividend might be something that is more likely to happen as opposed to a buyback."
2021-04-13 03:03:49,wallstreetbets,"I'm gonna be honest. I read the first paragraph, saw how long the post was and said nah fuck that. I'm glad DD is being put out on the company though.


I'd like to contribute by voicing my experience having UWMC underwrite my loan. I live in an area where selling your house at the listed price means you fucked up. Since buying my house in july its 'value' (according to redfin, take it with a grain of salt) has gone up 30K in value. To say it's a sellers market is an understatement.


All that being said, I contacted 5 companies about securing my home loan. Of the 5, UWMC was the fastest in replying, had the most competitive rates, and had the best customer service I experienced. 


What do I mean by faster replying? I heard back from Todd later that same day about my loan. Once my side of paperwork was submitted, it took... 2 days? Max? To get a pre-qualification that allowed me to make an offer. To put in perspective, I didnt hear back from the slowest until i closed (offer submitted Friday, reviewed monday, called tuesday saying it was mine if I wanted it).


What do I mean by beat rates? Better than the worst by over a whole percent.


What do I mean by best customer service? I emailed todd late saturday about some random question I had, fully expecting a response no earlier than Monday. This motherfucker hits me up with a response at 11pm that night.


Having said all this, I currently own no UWMC and do not plan on buying any just yet. Im full ape and 100% in GME. That being said, UWMC Is REAL fucking high on my GME tendie reinvestment plan.



I just felt like adding my personal experience with the company may give some perspective for someone."

I mean its just what its buying and sell for.

People are just impatient about price movements.

I bought at like 8.00, so this isn't that much movement

Can go and buy game stock at 350$ and think buying uwmc at 7.50 blows, LOL ok"
2021-04-13 04:37:19,wallstreetbets,You missed a point none of us 25-35 degenerates will be buying a house in the next year unless GME hits $1000

2021-04-12 21:32:34,wallstreetbets,"""Fuckton of shares""

Looks at ah volume 4,435. At an average price of 7.7*4,435= 34k...which was subsequently reversed a half hr later so is more likely a misprint.

I read the 10k and I don't have the numbers in front of me but I could've swore I saw they lost money and ended the year with very little in cash... I'm going have to take another look at it but didn't they have something like 20B in liabilities with only 50k in assets(not including 425m in restrictive trust)?"
2021-04-12 23:45:23,wallstreetbets,"I first saw this stock mentioned when it was around $10, highlighting the dividend and all the mortgage potential and shit. The hype has picked up more since then. Inclusion in the Russell 2000 or whatever. I can’t remember all the garbage I’ve seen. 

The stock price since I first saw it mentioned here? Tanked. Every time I see a $UWMC DD post I check the price and it’s always lower. You idiots that are still in should get out while you can."

2021-04-13 08:09:30,wallstreetbets,"UWMC has nowhere to go but down. They’ll have solid Q1 earnings, Q2 should look “acceptable”, but they cannot sustain the profitability they’ve had over the past few quarters. Rates have moved up, competition is getting fierce, especially in the TPO channel (UWMs only line of business). TPO margins have dropped from over 200bps to approx 30-40bps. And they can’t make it up in volume, we just went through the biggest refi boom in history. Brokers are very well positioned to capture refinance business. Not so much on the purchase side. Most builders won’t work with them and due to the low supply of existing homes the construction to permanent business is shot up (buying a lot and building a house). Guess who rarely has the ability to offer construction to perm loans... Brokers, and UWM doesn’t at all. I have no doubt they’ll continue to be a decent, profitable company and a huge player in the mortgage business. But by year end profitably will be a shadow of what they’ve seen the past 4 quarters."
2021-04-13 07:46:54,wallstreetbets,There should be a rule here about the same person not posting a DD about the same stock 25 times in a row .. I mean seriously ..
2021-04-13 11:04:34,wallstreetbets,"Originally this was put as a short term position to catch a Russel bulb and then I could funnel the profits back into GME at the next dip..

Instead of a bump the share price went down and every morning it's heavily shorted.  I like the idea of value stocks. They are certainly a lot less nerve wracking for this novice trader than trying to short squeeze hedgies.

But we aren't talking about Nintendo or viac. This is a mortgage company making loans at a time when millions of people are out of work and the only thing keeping them in their homes is a moratorium on foreclosures.

Maybe the government is steady behind the wheel. Maybe they learned a lesson last time. 

But my cynical nature says they still don't give a fuck and will buy puts on mortgage companies while the rest of us go down with the ship.

There is a reason they are shorting this stock. They remember 2008 like the rest of us.

Anyway, thanks for the DD. I'm not going to put more money in right now. Everything is red and I'm broke until something goes gree or Friday and either way GME is first in line.

I hope your right about everything. You sound real smart. Some psychopaths are smart too."
2021-04-13 02:30:03,wallstreetbets,Im holding but I still hate this fucking stock. I have held since the it gave me hiv or some shit and I should have sold it back then and bought fucking anything else.

2021-04-13 12:20:05,wallstreetbets,I make like $2k a month from covered calls on this stock. The premiums have been pretty solid.

I wouldn't buy this at 10 or 11, even though there is strong upside. I would buy this in the 7's or 8's as I've preached time and time again. Especially because the lower it goes, the more likely the company does something around earnings.

With that said, to each their own, and I'm glad you've recovered your losses. No one should wish another man to lose his tendies. I wish you good luck m9."

I think you'll find it very illuminating. 

As for the value trap, analysts  say the average is 11.20 on Marketwatch.  [UWMC | UWM Holdings Corp. Analyst Estimates | MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/uwmc/analystestimates) . With that said analyst estimates for UWMC in the first quarter look fucking bad, and are plain out wrong, so Marketwatch miiight not be the best source for me to use. I'd refer you to the Q4 2020 Earnings beat however. They did .62 EPS while analysts expected .30. 

 If you look here. They give guidance for closed loan volume roughly equivalent, or slightly higher than Q4 2020. With that said, as stated, gain margin is a bit lower so net income might be lower by a little bit.

2021-04-12 20:42:18,wallstreetbets,"Memes aside, this is an extremely oversold stock, and it's been beaten down roughly. However, it's a money maker. What one would call a rain maker. And it's paying me to hold it while I wait. So I am okay with what's going on. 

As long as my month on month return is where I want it to be, or over it, then I'll consider the trade a success. And ultimately, the more it goes down, the more likely there is a massive stock buy back."
2021-04-13 02:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Not only that, but more upside room to run.  This stock is so undervalued, it's more undervalued than GME was when it was in single digits.  UWMC is a fintech company and is growing market share in an industry with HUGE demand.  It made $1.37 Billion NET income last quarter and I wouldn't be surprised if this quarter is even higher.  They will be bigger than most banks soon.  These recent popularity challenges that have put the price so attractively low won't matter once earnings blow our minds next quarter."

2021-04-12 20:12:42,wallstreetbets,Will close this in the AM hopefully
2021-04-12 22:27:16,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip
2021-04-12 21:32:53,wallstreetbets, I bought the $170 / $150 put on the Cohen news and cashed it today for more than a double. This is WSBets ... Ya louds to bet both ways .. good on ya for seeing the trade right!
2021-04-12 20:41:56,wallstreetbets,You gon’ lose son
2021-04-12 21:03:45,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Although this is a rather risky and large example (since I don’t have that much long in GME), this is pretty much always how I hedge against losses on bullish positions I’m holding long term. As the stock price falls the put gains. When it turns around I exit the put and instead of just having an outright loss on my position, I snatched up a 31% profit from the put position. If the put immediately goes against me I will cut it right away."
2021-04-13 00:23:36,wallstreetbets,Calandar call spreads are great for this.
2021-04-13 13:55:20,wallstreetbets,It’s called a protective put for a reason
2021-04-12 21:42:06,wallstreetbets,"this is the way!

let's all buy puts next time we see a red day!"
2021-04-13 00:12:58,wallstreetbets,Selling puts is too scary for me in volatility like GME
2021-04-12 21:35:03,wallstreetbets,Good idea. I closed mine today as the bottom side is the $150 and my gain is kind of capped. If it closes the week at $140 I left $300 on the table but whatever.  Risk/Reward ... I think the stock may hold up because the options curve is very put heavy this week.
2021-04-13 10:21:55,wallstreetbets,Did you hop out?
2021-04-12 23:11:49,wallstreetbets,"That’s one strategy... not sure if it’s the best one, but it is indeed a strategy."
2021-04-12 21:41:28,wallstreetbets,GME got me day trader tagged LOL
2021-04-12 20:43:10,wallstreetbets,I’ll be out of this before I lose father
2021-04-12 21:11:20,wallstreetbets,He's just making money both ways lol it's not like he's trying to short the stock into the ground
2021-04-12 21:20:32,wallstreetbets,You made an ape a little less retarded today 😁
2021-04-12 23:11:27,wallstreetbets,I freaking love this.
2021-04-13 07:55:49,wallstreetbets,I'm relatively new to options. Do you pick stocks that maybe in bearish territory turn buy puts but never excercise them. Just sell as stock goes down?
2021-04-12 22:40:01,wallstreetbets,Be careful
2021-04-13 00:39:20,wallstreetbets,I might get burned but the premium has been insane.  If I get assigned ill be selling $80 puts and $160 calls.  I hope it works out and if I end up holding for the next 2 years to get even so be it.
2021-04-12 21:39:01,wallstreetbets,"same thing here. missed out on $400, but I still made something"
2021-04-13 11:18:39,wallstreetbets,I did. Came out with $2535.00 profit which was $28.99% gain for the position
2021-04-12 22:18:08,wallstreetbets,I have 3 in 3 days myself lol
2021-04-13 11:28:05,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I have never exercised an option. I rarely ever hold them to expiration except for a few that have gone out worthless on me. You generally don’t want to exercise an option because when you do that, yes you get to buy the 100 shares at the lower cost, but you lose all of the EXTRINSIC Val of the option if you exercise it. Also, in many cases I don’t actually have enough cash on hand to make the 100 share purchase were into exercise my option. I recommend educating yourself about options they are easy to learn. You will find that most options traders hardly ever, if ever at all, exercise their option contracts."
2021-04-12 22:43:30,wallstreetbets,"is it better to buy otm or itm? i never got puts before

we should make this strategy popular so gme holders dont lose money on red days"
2021-04-13 11:19:17,wallstreetbets,Good shit my man.
2021-04-13 12:02:10,wallstreetbets,I get that as consensus. Thank you for input.
2021-04-12 23:04:02,wallstreetbets,"Just get an online education on buying puts it’s all out there. OTM is substantially more risky, but with more upside as well. Its all about how much risk you feel comfortable with. This is a well known hedging strategy. My advice would be to start on YouTube maybe or here on Reddit and learn everything you can learn about options trading, both calls and puts."
2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$JPM - Earnings Season Bank Robbery - Financial Sector Options Analysis & Trade Thesis **$JPM - Earnings Season Bank Robbery - Financial Sector Options Analysis & Trade Thesis**

&nbsp;

To kick off earnings season, we’ve got seven of the largest American banks reporting their financials this week, and I want my slice of the pie. This week provides us with an awesome opportunity to make some money, as stocks within the financial sector tend to move extremely predictably post-earnings, allowing us to make some easy dough.

&nbsp;

#Implied Volatility during Earnings Season

Because it is earnings week, the IV on our options will be jacked to the tits as the option needs to price in any given “move” that the underlying may make. In practice, this is *extremely* hard to do right, and often results in an *extremely* inflated guess, as it’s calculated in relation to a whole fuckload of ever changing variables. The implied move that an option prices in around earnings is very rarely met, so if you buy options, understand that they will expire OTM 95% of the time. The other 5% of the time, you’ll get IV crushed so badly that you might not even walk away with any profits, even though you called the correct move.

&nbsp;

Armed with this knowledge, we know that if we wish to “gamble” on earnings, we’re best off selling the options. We may not hit any insane 10 baggers, but we’re extremely likely to pocket some free money, even if the underlying doesn’t move as planned.

&nbsp;

# The Play

If it wasn’t made obvious from the rundown above, we’re going to be selling options going into the financial sectors’ earnings season. The easiest and most consistent way to win during earnings season is to sell short strangles, and iron condors. With these strategies, we don’t need to be right about the directional movement of the underlying whatsoever. We simply collect a fat upfront premium, and then buy back the spread the day after earnings have been reported at an insane discount (often 60-80% cheaper) because of IV crush.

&nbsp;

Even though the options always price in a crazy move, historically, the stocks within the financial sector tend to *move very little* after they report earnings. This makes this play extremely safe in my eyes, as there is very little risk we get blown out by an unexpected move. Furthermore, the companies in this sector are very old, consistent, and established. It’s extremely unlikely that they would release something totally unexpected within their reports which would warrant a wild move, though the options still price it in anyways.

&nbsp;

To aid us in our play, [**I’ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of the Post-Earnings Moves that every single reporting bank has made for the past 20 earnings cycles**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16b_OLj9fDEyKlanro3qSeeSeNaD9XxMeyPv4NkclMN4/edit?usp=sharing). Using the spreadsheet, we can determine which options to sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for every single bank. For example, we can see that historically, on average, $JPM moves less than 2% following an earnings report, and that the largest move that $JPM has ever made post earnings was 5% to the upside. As a result, we know what if we sell a call credit spread that’s 5% out of the money, we can be almost certain that it will expire out of the money by the end of the week, allowing us to pocket most, if not all of the premium. For those traders who can stomach more risk, we can look to sell short straddles on $JPM that are 2% out of the money on both ends to pocket an even larger premium, while still having a favourable risk profile.

&nbsp;

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;


- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it’s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as *these banks report across different days*. Since 4 of the 7 banks report on Wednesday, we can use their results to “predict” the direction of their peers who haven’t reported yet. If the four banks are green after reporting earnings on Wednesday, the ones who report Thursday and Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.


- As touched upon above, **$JPM moves very little after earnings**. You can likely get away with placing extremely tight strangles as a result, since you run little risk of getting blown out on either side.

- **$WFC is allergic to delivering a good earnings report**. After its past 22 reports, Wells Fargo has tanked **18** times (82%). If you’re going to play this ticker, you can easily get away with selling credit spreads ATM or slightly OTM, as this shit is incapable of going up.

- Similar to Wells Fargo, **Citigroup either makes a small move to the upside, or gets blown out to the downside**. Slightly OTM credit spreads are the way to go if you’re playing this one.

- **If you’re playing Blackrock, make sure your strikes are far OTM**. It’s not uncommon for them to put up a 4% move post earnings. The moves are big, but the premiums are juicy. IF you plan on playing, I would look to play an iron condor, so I can have the protection if needed.

- In general, if you’re playing any sort of a strangle, you can safely sell any of the strikes which are outside of the highlighted maximum moves within the spreadsheet.

&nbsp;

If you use the spreadsheet to choose the safest strikes, these plays are incredibly hard to fuck up. You simply sell a short strangle / iron condor / credit spread, wait for earnings to be released, and then buy it back for significantly cheaper than what you sold it for.

&nbsp;

#The Gamblers Crutch

Selling options is boring, because you know exactly how much money you’re gonna make beforehand. If you wish to spice this play up with a little bit of *uncertainty*, consider picking up some **$XLF** Calls or Puts. XLF is made up of every single bank which is reporting earnings this week, yet since it’s an ETF, it has an extremely low IV, regardless of the fact that it’s gonna make some fucking *HUGE* moves since **all of it’s holding report earnings this week**. The implied volatility of each bank who reports earnings this week is around 50 or 60, yet XLF, who is made up of each reporting bank, has an IV of around 20%. 

&nbsp;

According to historical data, around earnings season, most banks move in tandem with one another ; they’re often all red, or all green. We can use this to our advantage, since half of the banks report earnings on Wednesday. Once a trend is established, we can grab some 2DTE XLF calls and bag some free gains once the rest of the banks report earnings the day after. You can also just be a degenerate and try calling a direction before the banks report all together, though this would literally be a crapshoot. Regardless, the rewards you can make by playing XLF this week are spectacular, and those who don’t want to sell the options should definitely capitalize on this opportunity.

&nbsp;

#Summary and Conclusion

Seven of America's largest banks report earnings this week. I’ve compiled a spreadsheet documenting their historical moves post earnings, alongside some interesting observations about them. It should be impossible to lose any of the trades you make on them, unless JPM announces that they’ve invented a time machine or someshit. For those who want to slam a 10 bagger instead of securing guaranteed premium gains, consider buying calls / puts on $XLF. All of it’s holding report earnings this week, yet it still only has an IV of 20%. Since banks tend to move in tandem with one another, it’s either gonna pop or plunge. If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to join my Discord, link can be found on my profile or in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**"
2021-04-12 20:22:53,wallstreetbets,XLF sounds like a good play. Banks are flushed with cash. This should be a blowout earnings report.
2021-04-13 00:12:37,wallstreetbets,"Good wsb posts have great content. Great wsb posts have headlines, bold font, and great spacing. With that spacing, headlines, and bold font who cares what this post actually says I’m in."
2021-04-12 21:14:51,wallstreetbets,"As far as I can tell, IV on all of these banks is already extremely low. Most of them show an IV rank in the single digits. Wouldn’t that make credit plays less desirable here?"

2021-04-13 02:09:17,wallstreetbets,"The last 20 earnings reports cover 5 years... Just be ready for losses on commercial loans, especially for commercial real estate. For example, on 3/30/2021 it was reported that American Dream (the new Mall in NJ) defaulted on a $1.2B construction loan with JP Morgan being one of the lenders. Going to be hard to predict what they reveal about such losses. In any case you might see some drops in financial stocks."
2021-04-13 11:56:10,wallstreetbets,"Nice write up! I have a lot of exposure to banks, so the low IV $XLF is a nice gamble to amplify gains or hedge. Personally I think the low IV XLF buy play is more interesting than the IV crush play - the historical context is interesting but this is certainly not a ""business as usual year."" Lots of factors at play - hedge funds blowing up, real estate market potentially in a bubble, massive inflation. Personally I would model a move based on the outliers in your spreadsheet rather than the majority. 

Picked up these for about 10k. Volume was pretty low so half my order on the 34P pushed it a penny.

2021-04-13 12:03:07,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, a long strangle wouldn't be the worst idea - fairly low chance XLF stays flat imo. Thanks for the insight!"
2021-04-13 13:19:37,wallstreetbets,Is your plan to wait for early week reporters and then bail on the side of the strangle that looks to be the loser or keep them both until nearer to expiration? Something else?

2021-04-13 13:21:49,wallstreetbets,"How does this have downvotes? Even IF GameStop becomes as good as Microcenter and offers people to come in and pay $ to play in tournaments and be able to buy PC parts, is likely still won't be financially successful.

People are still going to buy PC parts at home from online retailers where they don't have to go somewhere in person, check if one store has it in stock, and pay full price when they coulda just checked online against 10 online vendors offering the same thing, better in stock numbers, and with frequent sales they can have reminders and popups for.

Not many people at all want a PC BANG set up either in the US, as we all have good home PCs and pretty good internet. Why pay an hourly fee to be outside your home playing an online game? Only tournaments drive people and there aren't that many of those happening even precovid for many genres.

Like, in what crazy world view do people think GameStop is going to be popular in 2025 and beyond? Everything and I mean EVERYTHING would have to go ridiculously well for them. Perfect distribution, new store layouts, new offers and incentives, all new staff that aren't shitty, good preowned sale rates, etc, etc. The infrastructure alone for PC part delivery, staying in stock and up to date, rewiring it to have fiber for online tournaments, and more would cost millions of dollars before being profitable and we would see restructuring years away... There aren't even any real pilot stores or anything. It's gunna stay a boring brick and mortar and die that way too. Sorry to crush your childhood dreams, but consoles and PCs might not even offer physical games AT ALL on their next generations. It's way better to just let people digitally buy stuff and not need all of the physical production, waste, 18 wheelers, and retail salaries."

2021-04-12 23:32:09,wallstreetbets,the lower the price the tighter I hold. I remember when the price was down to $40 and everyone told us we missed the spike. All im saying is DFV hasnt sold and I wouldnt be surprised if he exercises his calls and puts it all back into GME.

2021-04-13 11:32:25,wallstreetbets,"Just keep buying to average down.  the stock will only go up, especially with Cohen's plans and their restructuring.  In time, the stock will jump as long as you hold.  The more people hold, the higher the prices go when more shares are bought.  Every two weeks, get 1 or 2 shares.

It's a game of attrition.  If you sell, they win.  Just don't use money that you need, like for rent, car payment, gas or enemas.

Edit:  You're going to see a lot of articles about how this all fizzled out.  It's propaganda.  They don't know what's going to happen.  They are only assuming.  For all we know, DFV could be planning to buy another 50,000 shares, or some other whale may do the same."

2021-04-12 22:06:19,wallstreetbets,I am also curious.  Serious question.  I feel like i made a bad decision buying at 186.  I had the opportunity to buy at ~41 out of pure coincidence.  Didn’t realize that was rock bottom then and decided to some more homework before buying.  Went back later to buy assuming it would be at like 48 tops...   was at 190 something.
2021-04-12 21:29:32,wallstreetbets,Why are u proud of losing money?

2021-04-13 05:43:51,wallstreetbets,Someone has to. Why buy now if you don’t believe there will be buyers when it goes up past $200? The risk reward just doesn’t make sense. In fact I think you’ve just persuaded me to sell now

If anything having the price go down will encourage the HF to massively double down and we will drive it right back up.

2021-04-12 22:12:29,wallstreetbets,"I dont know what the price will go to, but I think naysayers like yourself fail to understand the DD that's behind the short to begin with, and fail to fundamentally understand what an **infinite** squeeze means due to the inatr **infinite risks**.
The gist since day fucking one has been that hedge funds bet on not just lowering the price of gme (it was LESS THAN $5 A SHARE WHEN THEY STARTED SHORTING. HOLY SHIT, WHAT IS SO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND?) - That means they thought the price would be LESS THAN $5 BY 2021.

>it is currently hovering at 139 after 4 months.

That is...a doom scenario for a short position, especially one done at a conservative estimate tens of millions to possible hundreds of millions of synthetic shorting.


The thesis behind the ""meme price"" only requires that **one** of multiple DDs on this subject be correct

1)Those that claimed to have *completely* covered their shorts in January either lied OR did not cover a substantial amount 

2)there are other parties heavily shorting gme that did not cover beyond the ""big players""

3)the ""big shorters"" used the infinite money glitch last year to *substantially* short multiple companies outside GME

4)Shorters continue to artificially hinder GMES true share price by abusing dark pools and/or deep ITM calls to mask their FTDS



#any of these scenarios with GMEs surge since January would trigger a MOASS and result in an ASTRONOMICAL number

Could it stop at 3k? 5k? Sure. Could it HYPOTHETICALLY hit a million per share in this event? *Absolutely*

The really only counter to the four options above is,

>GME is currently not being heavily shorted by any big hedge fund that intended to bankrupt it last year 


So if you don't have a counter DD beyond that, you're just opting to be a contrarion clown."
2021-04-12 23:20:29,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-12 21:55:39,wallstreetbets,Lol I joke my cost basis is $17. But yes if you know why you got in and nothing has happened to change your initial motivation then why leave? Loss is only realized when sold.

2021-04-12 22:27:15,wallstreetbets,Td has short interest at around 18%. Do you think they are lying or just wrong? When this started it was well over 100% which justified the squeeze we saw. What more are you expecting?

2021-04-13 09:51:50,wallstreetbets,fuck msm
2021-04-13 11:34:26,wallstreetbets,"It feels really good when someone on the ""media"" is telling people to sell based on his fear of GME losing to some giants or GME fades as the price drops. That means apes are onto something real, so real the media is acting on behalf of the public, concerning our money suddenly."
2021-04-13 12:12:50,wallstreetbets,"Biden bought GME! This is huge, the Democrats support us. Even without a squeeze this is going for the moon! Alvin Biden bought 4 shares today."
2021-04-13 12:15:45,wallstreetbets,Longest losing steak due to clear market manipulation. I hope everyone gets what they deserve on this one.
2021-04-13 14:03:03,wallstreetbets,"I cannot unread the author's last name as ""Lip SHITZ"" btw"
2021-04-13 15:37:08,wallstreetbets,Anytime an article comes out like this it makes me laugh and buy more.
2021-04-13 16:52:23,wallstreetbets,Such bullshit. I like how they make it sound like a bad thing that Gamestop is allowed to sell 3.5 milly shares for up to a billion dollars. That's a good thing.
2021-04-12 23:21:04,wallstreetbets,A lot of dogs would eat poisoned meat.
2021-04-13 01:49:31,wallstreetbets,Must be nice living in a fantasy of this share going to $5k
2021-04-13 00:19:56,wallstreetbets,we got played and left holding the bag. big money won again
2021-04-12 21:57:55,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I just like the stock. 

Bought 10 more today."
2021-04-12 23:33:30,wallstreetbets,We just need that short interest back up lol.
2021-04-13 09:17:38,wallstreetbets,"lol. no. people didn’t “literally want to buy it,” market makers did. doing their job. providing liquidity and making money all the way down."
2021-04-13 16:33:36,wallstreetbets,Their definition of losing streak: -$1 on multiple days through massive fuckery on ETFs and darkpools
2021-04-12 21:17:25,wallstreetbets,Another share 2day keeps the bears away
2021-04-13 11:18:06,wallstreetbets,"I bought 500 shares at 135 today. 

Promptly sold them all a few minutes later at 140. 

Green is green, and why am I to argue against 2500 greenbacks."
2021-04-13 00:18:30,wallstreetbets,I added to my position today for the first time since I originally bought in back in January.
2021-04-13 00:28:01,wallstreetbets,How ? Their stock price is so high?
2021-04-13 01:10:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the price will go up again once they stop selling shares to us from the dark pools like a clown pulling endless knotted handkerchiefs out of their butthole."
2021-04-13 01:21:36,wallstreetbets,My average may be low but I bought more today and I'll do it again.
2021-04-13 01:22:47,wallstreetbets,I just like the stock
2021-04-13 01:42:18,wallstreetbets,"Imagine me with my PMCC selling 200c 5/31.

&#x200B;

Gay as a day in May."
2021-04-13 01:46:00,wallstreetbets,God you guys are thirsty lol
2021-04-13 01:55:40,wallstreetbets,"""Growing Scepticism"" wtf you mean? RC put together the most epic C suite team ever and you're sceptic? Its harder to find the floor when you tripping then to see its gonna turn around, dear MSM gtfo please. When this is all over you will have no one believing your ""news"" anymore."
2021-04-13 02:03:57,wallstreetbets,Nobody cares about the crap they write in that article! TESLA logo showing the way is the way.
2021-04-13 03:04:40,wallstreetbets,Come back to EV’s u tards
2021-04-13 03:12:49,wallstreetbets,"Ummmm not hating on GME or whatever, but this logic works for every single thing out being sold out there whether it be stocks, real estate or fucken tomatoes."
2021-04-13 04:24:00,wallstreetbets,I mean when an analyst drops the price from $12 to $10 it's major news somehow lol. It's the most retarded thing i have every seen my media FUD.
2021-04-13 04:28:18,wallstreetbets,"Started with avg of 44, now it’s 110. Waiting for a bigger drop, if it comes"
2021-04-13 04:35:58,wallstreetbets,Fuck these dark pools
2021-04-13 05:11:18,wallstreetbets,Cup and handle + micro cup nice
2021-04-13 05:42:52,wallstreetbets,"Bought few calls yesterday so I'm good.... Until end of April, then I'm fucked"
2021-04-13 06:16:08,wallstreetbets,"I dunno guys, the analysts have downgraded it to a ""sell"" and they are the professionals so eventually we have to listen to them right? Not doing so would be <nervous laugh> retarded."
2021-04-13 06:34:42,wallstreetbets,"Oh fuuuuuck, I need some confirmation bias STAT!!!!!!!"
2021-04-13 07:08:15,wallstreetbets,"Still averaging at 290, that'll teach them"
2021-04-13 07:43:42,wallstreetbets,Down from 365 to 200... ill do it again!! Give me more Shitadel
2021-04-13 07:49:09,wallstreetbets,market makers and other GME holders are buying the shares... come on guys i'm still playing with free GME shares but be sensible
2021-04-13 08:02:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's depressing, we've noticed."
2021-04-13 09:14:03,wallstreetbets,Needs more Doritos
2021-04-13 11:53:14,wallstreetbets,"It’s not trading “sideways” naturally but via market manipulation and buys rerouted through the dark pool. The true price is being suppressed, buys are rerouted. Does anybody know when or how this could actually stop?? One cannot follow charts since this is all literal rigged action."
2021-04-13 12:57:42,wallstreetbets,24 of those shares were me these past 2 days 💎🤝
2021-04-13 13:02:43,wallstreetbets,The fact GME hasnt dropped below 80 is all the confidence I need to say that hedgies havent won yet. And its still possible to squeeze
2021-04-13 14:02:11,wallstreetbets,"Edit:  ""Someone wanted it enough to buy it at over $350""

&#x200B;

So....."
2021-04-13 14:46:50,wallstreetbets,Grappling into straws I see. Lol
2021-04-13 16:38:34,wallstreetbets,Arrrggghhhh... I need to panic buy!
2021-04-13 17:22:12,wallstreetbets,"Ok cool, but when are we going back to $40 so I can buy way more than at 140?  Dance for us GME."
2021-04-13 18:11:48,wallstreetbets,118 tomorrow me gets more
2021-04-13 18:49:23,wallstreetbets,I just changed my charting to candlesticks because I like red.
2021-04-13 19:17:54,wallstreetbets,I hope to the stock goes down more so I can buy shit load of it. It's gonna moon baby.
2021-04-13 10:00:36,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully it will rise again, but it's been a fun journey with this stock."
2021-04-13 02:53:41,wallstreetbets,GameStop color is red. I think
2021-04-13 01:19:35,wallstreetbets,"Well yeah, I’ve got to delta hedge my puts."
2021-04-13 08:41:16,wallstreetbets,I bought more at $140 last time. Brought my average up from $37 but still worth it! Gotta average up lol
2021-04-13 06:22:39,wallstreetbets,Yep.
2021-04-12 20:40:50,wallstreetbets,0-60 (million) in 1.9 seconds
2021-04-12 21:39:18,wallstreetbets,this is the TA I came for
2021-04-13 03:15:40,wallstreetbets,So we’re predicting some resistance at 420?
2021-04-13 11:24:07,wallstreetbets,"It’s simple math, Guardian."
2021-04-13 03:20:20,wallstreetbets,Inverted Tesla.....a bullish trend perhaps
2021-04-13 17:34:42,wallstreetbets,That's how the market works now lol
2021-04-12 22:09:58,wallstreetbets,Than you can start writing covered calls and start actually making some money off of GME for once.
2021-04-12 20:05:57,wallstreetbets,I bought my 100th share at 4:20 today on cash app very happy!
2021-04-13 08:45:11,wallstreetbets,"Like pokemon, gotta collect each share at every dollar."
2021-04-13 16:58:18,wallstreetbets,"I made it to 100 eventually, which makes me comfortable because when it spikes to 10k I can get out and retire. Now every payday that it hasn't spiked I'm picking up another share or two for the continued meme. Who needs a liquid emergency fund?"
2021-04-12 20:11:39,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-13 05:45:28,wallstreetbets,You gonna but it all the way down to 5$?
2021-04-12 20:41:11,wallstreetbets,Smooth brain slam poetry... Edgy stuff
2021-04-12 23:02:33,wallstreetbets,Or you bought GME in early March or late January
2021-04-13 05:42:14,wallstreetbets,If Melvin has covered that means he is on -49% right
2021-04-13 07:06:22,wallstreetbets,"It’s looking like it wants to test the 100 day moving average which is about $89, can’t see it going much lower than that though."
2021-04-12 21:56:34,wallstreetbets,Thought I was the only one. Today was a good day :)
2021-04-12 23:23:06,wallstreetbets,Red is the best crayon color
2021-04-13 01:32:06,wallstreetbets,"But High, Sell Low is my motto"

2021-04-13 03:06:20,wallstreetbets,Samesies
2021-04-13 12:49:47,wallstreetbets,I'm stuck around there myself. Wish I had waited even longer.
2021-04-12 22:22:57,wallstreetbets,I have a feeling you typed this while fucking!
2021-04-13 00:53:01,wallstreetbets,Seriously. I’ll check now like once a day to see if we are on the moon. If not check again tomorrow 🙌💎
2021-04-13 00:20:56,wallstreetbets,Can you ask my wife to call me?
2021-04-13 01:30:50,wallstreetbets,*this is the way*
2021-04-12 23:43:21,wallstreetbets,Dad? Is that you?
2021-04-13 01:01:48,wallstreetbets,Buying 10 more shares tomorrow.
2021-04-12 23:46:47,wallstreetbets,I’m also a dummy who bought more shares today. Let’s gooo!
2021-04-13 03:46:09,wallstreetbets,"I will just keep buying the more it goes down and quite frankly the longer it all takes the more I will have time to put in. The dream for me is a year or two of 20/share because when it moons I'll just have had more time and money to buy cheap.



Red or green doesn't matter to me atm because I know it will all be golden brown and crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside in the end."
2021-04-13 05:56:47,wallstreetbets,"Another 16 on discount? Why yes, I do not mind at all my good sir. Hedgies are fuk💎👐🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-12 20:07:39,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
2021-04-12 20:35:55,wallstreetbets,Dont forget to get your dog a credit card and then taking out the entire cash advance.
2021-04-12 20:13:55,wallstreetbets,If it goes to the 50s I will sell my shitty car and go all in
2021-04-12 20:12:56,wallstreetbets,"Lol
@ $50 im gonna be so broke....
But hey, i love a great sale"
2021-04-12 21:51:34,wallstreetbets,"This completely. I have so many lines of credit untouched, if it goes to 50 or below we will be the hedgies even worse nightmare."
2021-04-12 21:37:34,wallstreetbets,"This guy is the apest, take some free silver."
2021-04-12 22:44:49,wallstreetbets,If it goes to 50 or less I’m buying to avg down. I don’t think anyone has higher avg than me.
2021-04-12 20:17:04,wallstreetbets,I second this
2021-04-13 04:11:46,wallstreetbets,"If GME goes to $50, I'll paper hand all my other investments and go all in on GME"
2021-04-12 23:46:43,wallstreetbets,I already took out a bank loan and am waiting for 50...
2021-04-12 22:47:53,wallstreetbets,Right there with ya. I’ve got a lot of dry powder if this shit dips
2021-04-13 01:29:38,wallstreetbets,"Sure why not commit fraud 😂 you know that’s one of the agreements you sign when taking a loan right?

Delusional bulls stoooooping lmao"

2021-04-13 14:11:55,wallstreetbets,This comment at 420 upvotes... what does an ape do?
2021-04-12 23:14:21,wallstreetbets,"It's even better since Gamestop has said nothing regarding this since the January squeeze. Every article that comes out, says Gamestop didnt respond for comment. They don't need to. They know what they are doing to shift the business and it will be shown soon. 

I'm jacked to the tits!!"
2021-04-13 01:01:45,wallstreetbets,"reporter email: hey gamestop whats up? anything new? btw check out my mix article

GME : huh <deleted>

Dunno, but I think this week is going to be crazy! 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-13 00:23:47,wallstreetbets,Nice couch
2021-04-13 12:28:10,wallstreetbets,Sit your ass now and re-ass(es) later. Much re ass’ing.
2021-04-12 23:05:20,wallstreetbets,Not true! When the shorts buy my shares for 5 figures or more they will do so without _wanting_ to
2021-04-12 23:13:25,wallstreetbets,"This is a total hit piece though, it's not just one part of the article I'm calling out.

I hear what you're saying, but it's important to recognize that, if the institutions were actually winning and gme lost its luster, it wouldn't have buyers over 100 bucks, period."
2021-04-12 23:24:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah such dishonest weasel words. It's also up, checks chart, 2,876.58% ""in a year."""
2021-04-13 06:57:42,wallstreetbets,I know math is difficult for you newcomers to wsb but you can in fact calculate losing streaks for longer than 4 months.

It makes you wonder if his company is short GME also."
2021-04-13 00:54:05,wallstreetbets,POS in deed
2021-04-12 23:07:30,wallstreetbets,Yep! And I'll be buying a bunch at that price (5 is a lot for me haha)
2021-04-13 06:56:59,wallstreetbets,The only thing desperate is your account.
2021-04-12 23:32:39,wallstreetbets,"Thanks fucking God, someone who is reasonable.

Can't wait till the circle jerk is over and we can get back to normal shitposting"
2021-04-12 23:00:50,wallstreetbets,"Price finding it's natural state, which is above $0. Why do people care what other people are willing to pay for gme stock? 

Does any one care what people are buying best buy at? Amazon? (Insert random biotech firms here)?

RC succeeded at chewy. Im betting on him doing it again. Is $130 to much for current valuations, sure. 

""Amazon would have to sell every book."" Or start selling other things.... or everything. 

Gaming is a real industry. Is RC guaranteed success, no. I bought stock in the belief he would."
2021-04-13 13:01:01,wallstreetbets,"Oh no, nothing organic about it, it has been discovered that they are making their purchases through dark pools while making their sales through open market. AKA they are only calculating price movement based on sold stock but not the purchased stock, massively surpressing the price."
2021-04-13 06:55:54,wallstreetbets,This is just sheer idiocy.
2021-04-13 16:07:44,wallstreetbets,This comment hurt my brain it is so fucking retarded.
2021-04-12 20:53:34,wallstreetbets,They're selling synthetics on the open exchanges and routing buy orders through the dark pools
2021-04-13 03:04:09,wallstreetbets,The average person over 40
2021-04-13 02:31:03,wallstreetbets,"News flair, not DD. And yes, it is true about every stock. That's what I'm saying, it didn't really drop like it should have because folks are still deeply into it, even when it looks grim. The article is a hit piece trying to say it's over."
2021-04-13 00:19:16,wallstreetbets,"We only have fake news, it's either Trump's propaganda machines or corporate fascists."
2021-04-13 07:44:59,wallstreetbets,Hopefully they all get wiped out in GME collapsing like a stone and fuck back off to wherever they came from
2021-04-12 23:15:07,wallstreetbets,Feel better? A nap helps.
2021-04-12 22:04:29,wallstreetbets,"This scenario assumes the only price retail bought at is 200 and that they sold at 125 instead of holding. If you buy high and sell low you lose. Truly a wrinkle brained hypothesis. 

HF A shorts at 200 and covers at 175 while HF B shorts at 175 and covers at 150, etc. Except that HF is paying interest to short. Retail has been buying the entire time (and according to Bloomberg has increased their position). If retail does not sell, then HF Y is going to get fucked as the price rebounds due to increased demand and they now have to pay everyone because their short didn't get covered by HF Z. If they short through the demand then they'll be paying interest out the ass and you can bet another HF will call their bluff (see late January). 

Nice FUD."
2021-04-13 01:30:57,wallstreetbets,"Yep, it's the natural paper hands dip."
2021-04-12 23:40:38,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but if you don't eat, you're gonna die anyway. Isn't that the entire story of retail vs. firms? We got nothing to lose."

2021-04-13 03:03:02,wallstreetbets,"Man, can you imagine if everyone’s idea of fun was just shitting on people for no reason?"
2021-04-13 00:22:45,wallstreetbets,"If you're feeling that way, you should get out for sure. And use what you've got to get a milkshake, pizza, or something and have a little fun.

Nothing should have that power over how you feel financially.

I knew this was coming, but I also feel positive about pushing up again.

If not, I'll take what's left and get my own shake!"
2021-04-13 02:20:06,wallstreetbets,I’d bet real money it’s never been higher...it’s just not being reported correctly.
2021-04-13 11:08:23,wallstreetbets,"Correct, and gme is still very interesting despite the crazy price."
2021-04-13 05:43:14,wallstreetbets,FUCKED WITH ALLL DAT MONEY IMA GET BITCH!!!
2021-04-13 17:24:58,wallstreetbets,It will stop when we all vote to recall

2021-04-13 01:27:42,wallstreetbets,My average is 350. Guess I’m just retarded
2021-04-13 03:40:32,wallstreetbets,"Everytime I try to buy low, with GME, the low keeps getting lower!

How low can it go???"
2021-04-12 23:37:45,wallstreetbets,135ish here. I bought 2 because then it will keep going down after I buy. Then I can buy more at an even bigger discount
2021-04-13 01:13:23,wallstreetbets,Average 210 Im averaging down like a champion!
2021-04-13 00:17:55,wallstreetbets,This is the price that is holding up.
2021-04-13 07:23:05,wallstreetbets,Adding more here
2021-04-12 23:45:25,wallstreetbets,That's my plan!
2021-04-13 00:46:21,wallstreetbets,I did this at around $120 with a $160c and it jumped so fast I had to pay a fortune to buy the call back and not lose my shares.  Now I'm afraid to try it again.
2021-04-13 06:55:30,wallstreetbets,"I've been doing that, has been working great until last week :D  Good job I got some protective puts too @ 180 back when it mooned over 250."
2021-04-13 09:53:19,wallstreetbets,"But see then if the HFs buy the call, they can exercise them at whatever strike you got and still get a hella deal.  I've thought about this too but then got scared because they can still take your shares."
2021-04-12 21:36:56,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the XXX club fellow ape. Damn that 100th feels good. See very soon on the moon.

2021-04-13 03:14:16,wallstreetbets,Jesus it’s like you people WANT to die poor. Taking out loans just to double down on a meme stock that’s clearly on the tail end of being relevant is... not smart.

Have you seen the amount of FTDs for each day since back in early february? 
Now go add those up and compare it to the daily volume on GME for the same period of time. 

And if you're to lazy to do all that you can just look at the OBV indicator on GME/AMC and compare it to the OBV on other regular stocks."
2021-04-12 20:36:33,wallstreetbets,Short volume doesn’t equal short interest. Every short sale could be a market maker facilitating a buy order. (It’s probably 50/50)

2021-04-13 07:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Individual ownership dropped from 9.5% to 7.5%.  Retail has sold 21% of their positions.  So, some people actually are selling.  According to Bloomberg terminal screenshots posted here."

2021-04-12 23:22:45,wallstreetbets,"The market makers sole responsibility is to create liquidity in the market.  Literally every single trade on the market is between an individual or institution and the market maker.  Market makers hold massive bags in some situations while doing this but profit at the end of the day based on the sheer magnitude of trades they make.  Every exchange has specific market makers and the SEC rules that govern how they work - you can read all about it.

If you’re going to trade stocks take the time to actually learn about the systems in place and how the market fucking works for Christ sake.  And to make matters worse, instead of learning about the market you are throwing real money into you chose to literally push an ignorance based conclusion that “someone likes the stock enough to be buying”.  I’m so tired of this sub being over ran with the unwashed ignorant masses of zoomers who know literally dick about the god damn markets.  Just shut the fuck up already.  Jesus."

Any arguement for or against GME mooning is moot because retail is playing the game blind and has very little say in its price. The only thing you control is whether you buy in,  at what price if you do, and when you sell. I can think of a few scenarios where there's a possibility for HF's to screw a majority of retail, but in no scenario does everyone lose. Most of those scenarios have HF's bleeding money to screw retail over, which I doubt will be the case due to their greed as well."

2021-04-13 06:24:06,wallstreetbets,"This. Leave us gen x alone, we literally don’t do anything."
2021-04-13 03:04:35,wallstreetbets,"I like how when someone explains how fucking stupidly wrong your post is, your only response is “I already knew it was wrong!” You obviously didn’t know that, or you wouldn’t have made such a dumb post in the first place."
2021-04-12 23:44:05,wallstreetbets,"If you know it, why are you lying saying “someone wanted it enough to buy it at over $135”.  The market maker is REQUIRED to provide liquidity - they don’t WANT your shit GME bags kid.  Shut the fuck up.  Don’t ever post here againZ"
2021-04-13 09:11:23,wallstreetbets,Suck on these nuts bitch.
2021-04-13 08:53:13,wallstreetbets,"You are not wrong, but you missed my point entirely. The original post is saying that there is demand for the stock at 135 (“someone is buying”) when what I illustrated was that the demand could be shorts covering. The SI doesn’t need to change because one short can sell to another short covering. This process can play out over and over until the only ones holding long term are those bleeding out (or worse, buying more on the way down) are the ones who get hurt. The HFs made their money (excluding, of course, those who were short before the big run)."
2021-04-13 14:13:26,wallstreetbets,"That’s only because it’s a few comments down. My comment about the bigger fool theory still got mega downvoted by dipshit ApEs

I honestly think I got the upvotes because I told them I don’t care about the upvotes"
2021-04-13 16:54:03,wallstreetbets,Well you’re in the money now so if you do buy lower you’ll just improve. If you want more I hope you get it but I struggle hoping it drops.
2021-04-13 17:17:43,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure what will happen tomorrow.
2021-04-13 17:17:58,wallstreetbets,Are you buying?
2021-04-13 11:14:05,wallstreetbets,But my tea leaves see a descending triangle leading to a bull flag and potato breakout
2021-04-13 19:50:54,wallstreetbets,That's literally not true lmao
2021-04-13 01:43:58,wallstreetbets,My brain was too smooth and I made four kids!
2021-04-13 09:58:56,wallstreetbets,"OG AF, FTW"
2021-04-13 01:16:40,wallstreetbets,80.08. I guess it hasn’t hit 800.85

2021-04-12 23:26:26,wallstreetbets,and it was in a comment instead of its own post
2021-04-13 01:14:51,wallstreetbets,Spanish villa here. We bought a whole 1/8 of a share!
2021-04-13 01:31:33,wallstreetbets,my position is undefined shares at $-300.00 per share
2021-04-12 21:45:04,wallstreetbets,I bought January 27 and February 1st on the way up and down. My biggest mistake was buying in at FOMO levels and not averaging down enough.
2021-04-12 22:41:20,wallstreetbets,I did too. At the highest.
2021-04-13 10:08:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah I agree with you that's why I'm not touching this thing with a ten feet pole. It was easy money in January though
2021-04-13 12:12:35,wallstreetbets,"I know there are options.

I'm just saying that I have already pushed as far as I am willing to push."
2021-04-13 04:33:10,wallstreetbets,"Ah, welcome friend. Glad to have you with us in our united cause.

Most of us have since quit trying to explain money grabbers that GME is not about grabbing money."
2021-04-13 03:22:10,wallstreetbets,I love you Ape!
2021-04-13 13:50:34,wallstreetbets,"I have a core position that I'm not touching and I have my ""trading"" shares. I have made enough off shares and options to fully cover my core position. It can go to 0 and I'm still ahead.

.. but I know what you mean."
2021-04-13 11:01:28,wallstreetbets,"Shorts were purchased back when GameStop was like, four dollars per share, no?"
2021-04-12 22:57:30,wallstreetbets,Yeah I looked into them but from what I saw they also stopped trading and use the same clearing house robinhood did. Plus they are china owned and I wasnt a huge fan of that
2021-04-13 17:08:55,wallstreetbets,"Wolf exited the board recently because his Hestia investors want their GameStop position liquidated at a massive gain. He could not liquidate whilst being a board member. Hestia, during Wolf's tenure, held 3.290mm GME shares.
I believe this is behind the recent downward pressure on the stock, and the almost continuous blocks of 1000 shares coming down (you could see this on Lvl 2). They wouldn't have shunted the whole lot in one go as it would have crashed the price - they need to filter them through to maximise return.
All that said, I think the bottom is in and I am hoping for a surge back to ~200 levels in the coming weeks. But who knows with GME, it is impossible to call - by the fundamentals, it's worth maybe 40-70. By the hype and now-global brand recognition (as pointed out by Kevin O' Leary) it is worth maybe 250 to 300. But right now, all we can say for certain is it is worth about 140, because that's where the ticker sits."
2021-04-12 20:20:40,wallstreetbets,If they do a recall. No way gme does that.
2021-04-13 11:06:34,wallstreetbets,I don't agree with him that I'm wrong. I just said I'm already aware about how transactions work.
2021-04-12 23:46:04,wallstreetbets,"Yesss.... Reply again, but with moar typos and caps. I'll totally change my mind if you do."
2021-04-13 09:13:07,wallstreetbets,"A reply and a downvote? Nice, now fuck off the sub and stop gatekeeping it."
2021-04-12 20:08:46,wallstreetbets,This made me chuckle
2021-04-13 02:49:08,wallstreetbets,"The hedge funds are simultaneously so powerful that they can manipulate the stock price downwards as much as they want in the face of all the diamond-handed apes, yet so powerless that they will be forced to buy at market price and drive the stock to the moon."
2021-04-13 11:49:29,wallstreetbets,500 yen open maybe?
2021-04-13 01:45:13,wallstreetbets,"Congrats. Every time I try to make kids I get kicked out of Wendy’s

Edit: whoever spent money on an award instead of buying another fractional share of GME is almost as retarded as me"
2021-04-13 07:17:39,wallstreetbets,"My brain is so smooth I didn’t know you could MAKE a kid.. Recipe, or ban!"
2021-04-13 09:51:44,wallstreetbets,You sure it wasn't your wasn't your wife's bf and his big wrinkled brain?
2021-04-13 01:28:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah putting in limit buys for $800.85 and then $80081.35 when the time cums
2021-04-13 01:12:03,wallstreetbets,I guess it also could’ve been Gabe and Charlotte Bobcats
2021-04-12 23:37:18,wallstreetbets,"I am in tho, got like 2 shares haha"

2021-04-13 17:01:52,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your post that this stock is once in a life time. Do you recall Enron? I was just coming of age then so I was clueless but I saw people lose a bunch of money to basically a Ponzi scheme! I’m not sure if HFs were involved back then, I was very, very green but I know illegal stuff happened like the illegal stuff now. Selling counterfeit stock!! I use options sometimes, good or bad I have the shares or money in my account. They all deserve real jail time, IMO."
2021-04-13 12:12:12,wallstreetbets,No idea. I just like the stock TBH. SS is a bonus that I have no control over.

2021-04-12 20:15:53,wallstreetbets,Naww it’s just fake news. If you pay attention you can see a pattern. It’s kinda fun
2021-04-12 20:22:23,wallstreetbets,Are you saying gme won’t issue a notice to recall for votes? It’s already in writing I think vanguard said the notice goes out on the 15th and you have until the 20th to get your shares back from lending if u want to vote it’s not a conspiracy just a fact idek if it would trigger a squeeze except that it sorta did last year

Well you are lol"

2021-04-12 20:57:11,wallstreetbets,I get it but you also likely have holding costs. So what is your daily cost here? How long until you are underwater the full mil?
2021-04-12 21:33:56,wallstreetbets,"It's actually about 8 dollars interest a day per 20,000 shares. (I checked today) I will be underwater the full mill in 342 years."

Eventually, one day even the GME Apes will get tired of paying GME's rent and salaries via capital raising and the stock will fall (much like will happen to AMC in the near future)."
2021-04-13 01:06:46,wallstreetbets,"Real world operates that failing companies, with inflated stock prices, issue shares and more shares (e.g. AMC) until shareholders finally have enough of it and the price tanks (I expect AMC for example to fall very hard). Oh wait, did not GME recently file too issue more shares... I guess if GME can turn things around and build investor confidence you can fundraise like this for a while, but eventually if they can't produce results, shareholders will not stick with a company that is going to be diluting its shares."

2021-04-13 04:00:43,wallstreetbets,"Regardless of the specifics the fact is there is the share offering. As to internal valuation of $285/share, I know how you did that math, but it means next to nothing. If the share price is currently $140 then the $285 per share valuation (it is not valuation so really hate the way you used the term) is completely irrelevant. It would only be relevant if the stock price went over $285 per share. Even then that is not correct as it is proceeds of $1B, not $285 per share, so they can sell at a much higher price level, if the price actually went that high, just less shares then the full offering."

2021-04-13 02:13:24,wallstreetbets,The “Valuation bubbles” argument exists to get people to sell. To benefit billionaires on Wall Street. And keep the game of destroying companies for profit going. I would say that “maybe” is a harsh word to use when it comes to transforming a company with Cohen at the helm.  Are you saying that value is the only thing that matters? There’s no money in speculative buying? What about a news article that would come out? What happened to Tesla over the last 15 years. Should everyone sell Tesla too?
2021-04-13 03:54:52,wallstreetbets,"That it was up 140x from the lows a month ago?

Yes it happened, but now its over. There are no catalysts left and holding like 7% of the total shares isn't gonna trigger anything because the trade restrictions on 26th January and subsequent dip allowed them to book their losses or hedge their shorts.

You can go ahead, take a look at OI chain and calculate amount of naked shorts in the market atm. You'd find it almost every short bet is hedged.

Apart from that, the daily volume is high enough to reduce DTC significantly low which wasn't the case back when the squeeze was on. It was over 6-7 days back then."
2021-04-13 08:14:55,wallstreetbets,Where are you seeing that? How do you explain the 192% institutional ownership on Bloomberg terminal?

2021-04-13 02:38:13,wallstreetbets,"The valuation bubbles argument exists to benefit billionaires? No clue what you are talking about and it makes no sense what you are saying. This is beyond idiotic.

As to comparing to Tesla... There was no EV market a few years back. Tesla created the business. Digital game markets are all over the place. Maybe they can use some improvement, but vastly different creating a revolutionary EV business when there were no EV's (and everyone thought it was a joke, until it was not a joke and became an existential threat) versus trying to make a better online store. Seriously, comparing things to Tesla (or Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc) is a bit ridiculous."

But if you do read those article with the 10-40 price targets, how come they never mention the high ownership?

>Also you seem to have missed the news that there will be, if the funds want too, a share recall starting the 15th and we have DFV almost certainly exercising his calls on Friday. Last time he did that we jumped too..

And? You do realise that even if you account for synthetic shares and treat the float as 69 million, retail still owns only 11% of it? Did you miss the Bloomberg terminal post?


>But I guess you prefer posting 5 comments in a single thread how GME is going down then doing a little research in up coming, potential catalyst.

2021-04-13 03:56:44,wallstreetbets,"You don't seem like you are asking for an honest opinion, but here goes.

My opinion is not to buy GME.

Do what you want. It is your money.

The only arguments I have seen for the price of GME has effectively been, buy shares to squeeze the hedgies. It is rare I see anyone try to argue that the pricing is based on some valuation of the company itself. With Tesla by comparison, I rarely have seen anyone suggest that the value is based on anything other then potential future profitability.

So make of that what you will. Combined with the company raising funds via issuing shares and I am sure they will issue more shares in the future (it gets expensive transforming these businesses and building an online business), I think it is near certain the stock will fall a lot more. It can definitely shoot up in the interim, like it did end of Feb.

Further, I would argue if the company cannot generate sufficient cash internally, they may find themselves with too low a share price to continue raising funds on the capital markets and that would pose an threat of going bankrupt. Basically, GME works as an investment if people buy into the story and keep the price inflated. Unless you have lots of confidence in the business, I would stay away."
2021-04-13 04:55:51,wallstreetbets,"Wait which one is it now, retails own barely 7% or 11%? I’m confused."
2021-04-13 10:07:58,wallstreetbets,"I did. If you're so lazy that you won't see a post on hot of WSB, I don't know what to tell you."
2021-04-13 04:11:35,wallstreetbets,"Depending on how many shares they’re looking to issue I don’t think it is going to have that big of an effect on price first round. Of course that would be ruled out if I thought that people that bought in at 150-200-300 would sell for a loss at that point and we would see a stock worth $2 on the verge of bankruptcy with no hope. But I don’t think that’s the case. And with the leadership in charge and being put in place it’s probably going to do very well with its financing plans moving forward. I’m still bullish on the price in the long run. So since I like the stock, I’m probably going to buy to multiply my shares and it’s a matter of where the next dip lies. That’s my take."
2021-04-13 05:02:27,wallstreetbets,"7% of all traded shares. 11% adjust for the real float.

2021-04-12 23:33:01,wallstreetbets,You are
2021-04-13 01:14:01,wallstreetbets,"Yepppp.. I think a lot of people held and didn't sell when they were up a life changing (or at least enough to start making enough to be life changing) amount of money. All for the chance to play the small chance that it makes even more than the ridiculous 5-20x gains they already saw. 

I really hope it works out. Because if not, a lotttt of people are gonna regret not taking profits. I mean take a look at your situation. 300k isn't exactly life changing, but it's enough that you're sitting just a few good trading years away from $1M+ in the brokerage account and never having to work a day again. But only 35k... well that's a great start but could still take years just to get back to that 300k spot.

I hope the best of luck to you man. I respect you at least admitting you regret not making profit. I get it. I'm in the same boat. I made off decent, but nothing close to what I could be sitting on right now if I would've taken profit when I told myself to rather than listening to others"

2021-04-12 20:19:38,wallstreetbets,Short it then
2021-04-12 23:36:54,wallstreetbets,I did. Invested 10k (earned via minimum wage) into GME at a $41 cost basis in January before the Citron call with Left where he made a fool of himself. Held throughout and am still holding.
2021-04-12 21:35:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, well, you shouldn’t have done that I guess."
2021-04-12 23:43:14,wallstreetbets,"I started with 7k and currently moving 31k haven't take a penny out of my brokerage, keep positive and learn and learn and learn there is money here the key is to be patient. Note if it's your case I also make a little over the minimum wage I wake up at 4 am and get back home at 5 pm but someday I will have 100k to play with investing and then I will quit my job. Taxes are going to be fun this 2021 for me also 😆🤣"

2021-04-13 18:59:52,wallstreetbets,"Lol, why would I try it? I have just a $1000 in gme cause that’s what i can afford to lose.

in 6 months i was up 300% and didnt take profits..."
2021-04-13 10:53:26,wallstreetbets,"Idk why people are downvoting this tbh, it’s pretty logical. I had 30k at the peak of GME and as a 19 year old that would’ve changed my life. Instead, I’m down all the way to 3k praying I break even to 6k."
2021-04-13 19:32:34,wallstreetbets,"You won't make any GME friends speaking the truth about how they chose to stay poor in the name of some ""cause"" nobody cares about.

The occasional religious zealot shouting at the top of his lung about how the end is near while people just want to eat some fries will/should be gently escorted out to go be insane somewhere else.

2021-04-13 11:07:39,wallstreetbets,"Because it hits too close to home for some and people don't want to admit it. It's textbook denial. I mean, I was in that stage for a while. Justifying to myself why I didn't take money that would've set my portfolio BIG during the first AND second spikes. But eventually I was just honest with myself that, while it may pay off, it also may not and I'll have to live with knowing that I left some potentially life altering money on the table to get greedy for even more life altering money.

I don't know what your trading experience is, but trust me. Being able to accept that sometimes you fucked up a trade (not that the entire market is against you) will transform your trading significantly in a positive way. Knowing when to cut losses is just as important as knowing when to take your gains. As they say, ""no one ever went broke taking profit."""

2021-04-12 23:13:45,wallstreetbets,"Watch the 10 year treasury. It’s at 1.685%. If inflation is hot, it will shoot up above 1.7%. 2% is bad. It has to stay below that. Some say it will hit 2.25% by summer and then cool down 2nd half of 2021. Hot inflation will hurt the high growth tech stocks like Tesla and Fiverr. The report is at 8:30am eastern time. Good luck."

2021-04-12 21:50:40,wallstreetbets,Spy will be 500 by then. That’s why they call it s&p500. Stock&Price 500 in June
2021-04-12 21:36:02,wallstreetbets,"Sell in May and go away.  You're early, likely get some ok earnings coming out with slightly more upbeat guidance, and then the market fades going into end of May.  These may print in June for ya."
2021-04-12 23:31:54,wallstreetbets,"1) the calls i am selling are actually profitable if the stock climbs.

2) selling calls brings down my average per share cost

3) no, I think AMC is a shitty play because of fat C-level bonuses, and more share dilution."
2021-04-13 00:45:17,wallstreetbets,Ill buy a 500 call just for you.
2021-04-13 04:31:17,wallstreetbets,I was selling weekly covered calls on my 100 shares of amc at the $12 strike price and just picking up premiums to lower my cost basis on the shares. Last week while amc was still trading above $10 I sold a jan/2022 12c to collect a $3.10 premium because I had no buying power in my account and I wanted to lob some money into pltr calls. Let's hope the parlay works!

2021-04-12 22:17:07,wallstreetbets,"Did you know you can lose less money by just picking a closer strike like 30$ ? And just a much closer expiry..  that’s how you swing stuff like this.  And you don’t go this OTM unless you have a clear catalyst or intend to swing overnight..  otherwise you’d want at least 1 whole year expiry for a call this far out..  June is way too close to expiry bud.  

this set up usually get continuously theta raped, you might break even if it gets to 50 by June or has a short squeeze but why wait with all the theta.   

You will get to -90% sooner than you think this way because it’s never even close to being ITM - max theta at this set up, also you need to check the IV..  

also with the type of delta this call has, you’re basically only gonna catch big moves anyway so better to not to hold it to -90% cause then you NEED a big move

Go closer to the money and closer expiry and just swing these things for a few days max"

2021-04-12 21:38:39,wallstreetbets,"Any reason why you are going stock vs options here? Are you playing this long term? If not, you might benefit from just get an option and put the rest into some stable stocks. 

You can buy the April 30th 39c 41c debit spread for about 8 dollars. Not a bad play. Just buy 10 or so. Worse case scenario, you lose about 80 bucks. The investment of the rest into something more stable should help offset that. 39c 40c call debit spread for April 23rd is also only 12 dollars.

Edit: Sorry read some more of the DD. Probably not good idea to play it short term but leaving this here just in case you want to."

2021-04-12 20:18:40,wallstreetbets,Isnt Tilray using CRISPR for weed?
2021-04-12 20:36:24,wallstreetbets,Yeah turns out injecting proteins that can glom on to your DNA has some negative consequences. Off-target effects (i.e. non-specific binding of the proteins to non-targeted regions of DNA) are going to be an issue for CRISPR but perhaps not insurmountable.
2021-04-12 20:31:33,wallstreetbets,Yes and Rocket is using it for mortgages
2021-04-13 01:12:40,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. So, I would think using things like mRNA to target proteins created by cancer as opposed to CRISPR which would attempt to rewrite DNA is much more practical in the near term. Maybe 30 years down the line, as our understanding of genes continues to improve, CRISPR is suitable to actually be used in humans."
2021-04-12 20:52:39,wallstreetbets,"> There is nothing in this link about Editas. The players are the Broad Institute, University of California, and University of Vienna.

- I clearly cited two different sources both filed with the SEC that clearly states an agreement between Broad, and EDIT. You're right about there being nothing in that article linked mentioning EDIT. Because I can't literally give you a gold sticker for reading here's a ⭐️ for reading the article. Here's a statement from [Broad itself](https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/broad-institute-harvard-and-mit-license-crispr-cas9-technology-editas-medicine-therapeutic), even their [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editas_Medicine), or [here because I like odd numbers](https://www.genomeweb.com/business-news/editas-medicine-provide-broad-institute-125m-crispr-funding). This now brings the total amount up to 5 different sources. 

> Getting a license is not the same thing as having the patent, so your post was misleading in this regard.

- To which I clarified that EDIT has the exclusive rights to commercialize it. I mentioned this in my original DD post as well twice. Broad retains the patent, and EDIT has the right to commercialize with their own products along with sub-licensing which they can collect a royalty from. I have provided multiple statements filed with the SEC that states this one from Broad, EDIT, and one from BEAM to provide an example of an existing license agreement. 

> Also, it should be noted that these are trials for drugs developed by Bluebird bio not Editas. 

- The original OP of that post never said it was EDIT, and neither did I. I agreed with both of you, and said it was a valid concern.

> Impacts every aspect of our lives: you just give a quote about the potential for therapies which isn't every aspect of our lives.

- Did you eat dinner today? Last time I checked food was a part of our lives. Ag-biotech is a huge thing, and crispr is already being used. I have a friend with retinitis pigmentosa who I talk to daily who could be potentially helped. That's an impact on his life. But, I have a feeling whatever I say you'll still find some way to shit on it. 

> What was that about not wanting people to know your personal finances? You still haven't given proof of these positions just tried to deflect away by saying you don't want people to know your finances.

- I conceded, and gave you a reason. I use Fidelity as my broker which includes the overall percentage of the portfolio. It's not the amount of shares I care about it's the overall value of the portfolio that I'd like to keep private because it's easy to do some basic math to find out. Frankly, I'm getting the vibe that whatever answer I give you wont be sufficient, and at this point I no longer care. For shits, and giggles I DM'd an uncensored version to OP that he has seen. If he chooses to verify that he's seen it that's fine. If anyone else wants to see it I'm open to sending it to them as a DM. If you choose not to believe me I don't care.

Look you're a smart dude. I typically enjoy conversations with people smarter than myself. I have provided multiple sources, and a writeup on my opinion. I've even entertained providing responses to your claims. If you want to call anything I presented shit then I'm open to having a dialogue about it. I'm game, and I'd enjoy it. But, calling me a snake, cherry picking statements,  and having a flame war is not a productive use of my time. If you think it's a productive use of your time reevaluate your life, and I'm honestly a little concerned that you care this much considering you have 0 skin in the game."

Pfizer's and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA, whereas I think J&J was a traditional one (you stick in some inactivated virus with the spike protein so the body recognizes it). I think issues with stability of mRNA and getting it to the cell to produce the spike protein is why two doses are needed there (in order to produce enough of the spike protein so the immune system can develop the necessary response) versus one for the J&J vaccine."

“Far better it is to dare mighty things, even though risking failure, than to take rank with those timid souls who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.” - Franklin Roosevelt

Arthur Grayson: The last eighteen years have been difficult ones for our clients, but, oh, did they dare mighty things. Consider, for example, those who invested in our Twenty-First Century Tax Advantaged Select Growth Fund. I wish I had that kind of courage.

This fund, one of the boldest and most revolutionary ever launched on Wall Street, was intended to combine long-term equity growth, steady capital formation, reliable dividend yield, and minimal tax exposure.

[Graph shown of the investment losing money at a staggering rate, plummeting farther and farther into the red over time]

Unfortunately, it instead turned out to combine immediate capital hemorrhaging with flat or non-existent dividend growth, followed by a period of stagnation, then more capital hemorrhaging, and, surprisingly for a tax-exempt fund, extremely heavy back-end tax penalties.

In addition, many investors were referred for criminal prosecution by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and more than 7,000 had their identities stolen by the Russian Mafia, which had unwisely been given access to our computer system. Three had their U.S. Citizenship revoked.

Had you invested $100,000 in this fund five years ago, that investment would now be worth absolutely nothing, with a federal income tax liability of nearly $840,000. But you would have something more important than money - that you would have none of. You would have the pride of knowing that, though you failed, you had dared mighty things, unlike those timid investors who, in the words of the poet, know neither victory nor defeat. Although I suppose investors who placed their money with our competitors, and thus made a fortune, could argue they actually did, in fact, know victory. And perhaps, in a financial sense, they did. But they didn’t know defeat. That is something only our clients understand.

Grayson Moorhead. Losing our clients’ money with dignity and pride since 1926.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Psychology Vs Strategy In chapter four of his book Blink, Malcolm Gladwell describes how Paul Van Riper, a retired Marine commander, drove the U.S. military to fits in a war exercise called “Millennium Challenge.” It’s a brilliant argument for the plan-as-you-go idea compared with the traditional plan method.
The Millennium Challenge was an exercise designed to test the military’s ability to deal with a simulated war in the Middle East. It pitted a very large team (Blue Team) equipped with a very detailed battle plan, a lot of computer models and simulations, against a very small team (Red Team) led by Van Riper, experienced and self confident and good at making quick decisions.

“Blue Team had their databases and matrixes and methodologies for systematically understanding the intentions of the enemy. Red Team was commanded by a man who looked at a long-haired, unkempt, seat-of-the-pants commodities trader yelling and pushing and making a thousand instant decisions an hour and saw in him a soul mate.”

As you’ve already guessed, Blue Team is the might of the military, and Red Team is essentially one smart guy who starts with a plan and revises it constantly as the battle ensues.
When the game was actually played, Van Riper surprised the Blue Team quickly with a move not in its plans, and as they reacted to that, he surprised them again, and quickly caused considerable unexpected damage to a much larger force. It was all simulated and hypothetical, but the result was that the quick-to-react team with flexible planning beat the pants off the very detailed plan team that couldn’t react to changes.

“Had Millennium Challenge been a real war instead of just an exercise, 20,000 American servicemen and women would have been killed before their own army had even fired a shot.”

That was pretty hard for the military to explain. They analyzed it a lot.

“There were numerous explanations from the analysts at JFCOM (Joint Forces Command Center) about exactly what happened that day in July. Some would say that it was an artifact of the particular way war games are run. Others would say that in real life, the ships would never have been as vulnerable as they were in the game. But none of the explanations change the fact that Blue Team suffered a catastrophic failure. The rogue commander did what rogue commanders do. He fought back, yet somehow this fact caught Blue Team by surprise.”

Implicitly, the problem was the big team full of computers and data trusted a static plan, while the other team didn’t.

Red Team’s powers of rapid cognition were intact—and Blue Team’s were not.

So relate that to the planning we want: planning that responds to rapidly changing reality. Not just “Duh, I can’t plan, I don’t know the future,” and not just “Why plan? Why bother” and not “We have to follow the plan,” but planning as you go."

Quick decisions are stupid. Pick good stocks and hold them and have a target before you buy."
2021-04-12 21:02:46,wallstreetbets,"I assume we apes are the red team, and Melvin is the blue team. They can't plan for us, because we don't fit the traditional game plan or any of their pre-thought-out  contingency plans. Hold MFS!"

2021-04-13 01:28:53,wallstreetbets,MY MAN! I’m also stuck into MGNi as well. Fuck me. That shit only moves one way.  The volume is shit and it constantly tanks after hours.  I’m 1550 shares into pltr and only 320 into mgni and I’m down heavily on both.
2021-04-13 16:24:03,wallstreetbets,"Strong day, up 93% holding to see what tomorrow brings with demo day."
2021-04-12 21:56:41,wallstreetbets,"honestly, I don't think it will hit 30 from demo day. Believe me, I want it to hit 30 on demo day, but this stock has been heavily shorted. The only thing that's getting palantir over 30 is new contracts.  

They potentially have a new contract with the US government. Look at Felix & friends on youtube, he has a good video on this. 

I currently hold 1,400 shares at around $25.50 

I expect PLTR to do real well this year. I'm holding long term here."
2021-04-12 20:13:59,wallstreetbets,I'd be content with 25 at this point lol

2021-04-13 16:24:06,wallstreetbets,Down a little.  But it was also the only position I was down today.  Still gonna hold it.
2021-04-12 21:06:58,wallstreetbets,🤦🏻‍♂️
2021-04-13 17:37:36,wallstreetbets,"good for you.  I'll keep asking every dollar it goes up.

Assuming that it never returns to $15, do you have an exit strategy?

I'm long $30 calls (100 contracts) and short $24 puts (12 contracts) by the way, entered for a tiny net credit, all expiring Friday.   The most likely result is that everything expires worthless but I'm holding out hope for a run to $40 and a $100k profit on demo day.  Fun times tomorrow!!"
2021-04-13 13:57:05,wallstreetbets,Did you short tsla too?
2021-04-12 22:33:55,wallstreetbets,Its a software company right?
2021-04-12 22:27:47,wallstreetbets,What?  lol
2021-04-13 18:10:49,wallstreetbets,It's OK.  I'm not at a loss until 36$ since I factor this is my continuation of my short from 32 to 20.50. I do expect to cover around 15$ this time
2021-04-13 14:09:58,wallstreetbets,I am.  Haven't initiated the position yet. The run up is helping a lot though.  I will likely be looking to do this end of day or tomorrow.  If it rides over 750$ I'll initiate.
2021-04-13 03:06:39,wallstreetbets,Elon did it with the Cybertruck and look what happened to TSLA after

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,VXX Options: Short Term Bet on CPI & Inflation Call ex 4/16 
2021-04-12 21:46:53,wallstreetbets,"**For anyone wondering why I'm doing this:**  
The VXX follows the VIX (known as the *fear index*). Although they correlate quite well, there are some differences, which I won't get into here. My wager is that volatility will *increase* in the short term, thus driving up prices on the call options.

High inflation may seem like an anachronism, but it's about to revisit us with force. It can be pure poison for growth stocks and causes higher short term volatility. Reason is that higher inflation raises pressure on the FED to raise interest rates. That in return, makes stocks and other equities less favorable to bonds and holding hard, cold cash.

As for the trade itself: When markets tanked in March 2020, the CPI (Consumer Price Index) also dropped. We now get to exclude that month for the new 1 year moving average, which will make rates jump higher. I'm betting the markets will get spooked ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)"
2021-04-13 14:44:01,wallstreetbets,What will the reverse split do to that?
2021-04-13 00:15:26,wallstreetbets,"This trade is insane and this is a like an impossible pool shot. Even if your theory is correct vxx might not spike because of short term futures decay among a variety of other reasons. You would have been better off buying options on the actual VIX for this one. 

But it's a real bet and deserves to be here. Congratulations retard you made all of us a little more smooth brained from this post."
2021-04-12 21:32:59,wallstreetbets,It's a one night stand with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
2021-04-13 14:48:31,wallstreetbets,No impact. Options prices will merely shift in accordance with the ETN's price after the split.
2021-04-13 01:20:31,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the input.

And yes, I'm a retarded contrarian. Going long on the VXX is financial kamikaze, so I'll be out shortly after I see how the markets interpret the CPI dump at 8.30 EST.

Re: choice of contract. I picked the VXX as it's highly liquid and a contract I'm familiar with. I do agree that options on the VIX itself may have been a better choice."
2021-04-13 01:39:55,wallstreetbets,I've traded VXX a lot. I usually just short it with good results.
2021-04-13 14:47:18,wallstreetbets,"Got out this morning at 0,35, which made me lose about $1.300. CPI inflation came in at 2.6, way below my expectation of 3+, so markets were relatively steady. Regardless, it was worth a try."
2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I hope tomorrow is better 🚀 
2021-04-13 00:58:02,wallstreetbets,It's almost like hedge funds sold off today to stop the rally. It's almost like they are short aapl til next week.

2021-04-13 12:51:21,wallstreetbets,The announcement of the iPad that was just announced is also a medical play and ties into the information I gave the group on Abbott labs. The iPad numbers for quarter 1 2 and 3 this year will be remarkable. The fda approval for remote programming of spinal cord stimulators will benefit apple iPad and phone sales for some time.

2021-04-13 11:23:24,wallstreetbets,Money is money. I remember when I was new to trading for a little edgy when I made trades I thought afterwards fuck if that goes bad I'm in deep shit. After awhile you get more confidence and don't rush out. But congrats on making money and being on the right side of the trade.
2021-04-13 12:01:54,wallstreetbets,I’m still fairly new to trading only been trying for a year the past month I’ve finally seen gains but thank you for the advice 🙏

2021-04-13 16:08:46,wallstreetbets,I trust you more than myself lol 😂
2021-04-13 16:17:00,wallstreetbets,All good. We all should win.
2021-04-13 16:48:45,wallstreetbets,When you use calls that way have your solid price target for the expiration. And after a quick bounce back on Tuesday you should always let that happen its normal and look at profits you left on the table even if you had a 135 target for the week which I am looking higher than that. You we already to the good and in a breakout.
2021-04-13 17:40:50,wallstreetbets,I will keep trying till I get the formula correct 💪

It's not because you're the only person who has seen this bit of her; it's because no one who has seen this bit of her has cared as much as you do.

The problem with having secrets like this is you start to think you are a secret keeper. You develop an ego. You think you see things others don't. You think you appreciate things others don't.

So when you start investing, you accidentally think you see a secret freckle in the market, and you go all in. The only problem is the market isn't a woman--it's, somehow, something infinitely more fickle and confusing. That freckle was a spot of make up, a ruse. You learn the hard way that the market doesn't love you for your attention like she does."

Let's try flooding the Melvin offices with physical letters. I'm talking literal millions. Doesn't have to have writing on it or anything, but I long as there are words on the paper in there they have to check it in case it's something important. No death-threats though, just stupid shit. 

You probably can't be sent to jail for writing letters to a corporation, at least until they make the first amendment illegal.

Put on something comfy regardless. Like, your comfiest, squishiest clothes. Sit outside for 10 minutes, set a timer and don’t look at your phone. If you chose coffee, sip your coffee and enjoy being alive.

Just enjoy being in the moment and getting some fresh air. 

Coffee: go back in, put something funny on, and chill. You deserve it. 💝

If no coffee, then go take a nice warm shower. Sitting is fine, no judgement. Enjoy the hot water. 

Then curl up and sleep, bud ❤️

2021-04-13 01:21:56,wallstreetbets,do you need to ask? this is WSB obviously you buy the $1000c on margin
2021-04-13 01:27:04,wallstreetbets,"Smaller ones typically.

If you have a call that is at the current price and costs $1000 just to get the contract then when it goes up to $1000 you made $860 per share or $86,000 less the $1000 premium so down to $8500 or so (assuming time is running out so the premium is gone).

If you buy calls that only cost $100 it is probably only going to be at about $200 strike price in most cases but let's say it is actually $300 strike because other people know the potential and bid towards it.  That means you have 1000 contracts worth $700 a piece at the end or $700k.  

You are less likely to lose big money on a close call though.  In that same example if it went to $300 you still got $16k on the first option and zero on the second"

2021-04-13 00:22:22,wallstreetbets,"Yea the joke was suing a hedge fund will go no where whereas i can at least shoot him without it being treated as a terrorist attack on wall st

Edit: to go deeper into my job (studying black market economics) contracts in black market economies between major players actually have less friction costs (negotiation, legal frameworks, maintenence) because contracts are enforced by threat of overwhelming violence, not the possibility of legal repercussions. This means that contracts with entities with established reputations of enforcing contracts are actually more trustworthy than most legal contracts, as bankers don’t usually rape then skin then burn alive your daughter if you miss a payment by 1 dollar.

Thats the level of enforcement these entities often have, 1 dollar short is enough to kill over because most product is moved on fronts to ensure liquidity in what is a fairly illiquid market with high transportation costs. So cartels and others will kill over that 1 dollar just to ensure that nobody thinks of running off with any of the product they are loaned.

Edit 2: high transit costs of product AND money, meaning that paying for goods is often as risky as selling them. In fact more enforcement budget goes towards intercepting money than product in law enforcement. So having the guy downstream assemble all the money for product he needs to still pay for makes sense in a risk management way. Plus if the guy who got fronted loses all the money and product, you can put him in debt and assume no liability for that loss."

2021-04-13 01:49:31,wallstreetbets,"I’ll expand:

Go get a simple handyman or contractor license depending on your state requirements. Between the filing fees, bonding, insurance, and articles of incorporation it should run under 1k. 

All bid-action contracts are easily located through the muni and district budgeting committee. 

Begin an absurd amount of DD as you rip through thousands of scheduling books, architectural plans, and municipal code as you attempt to find areas you can reduce the overhead on.

Research your own cheaper materials to fit the projects while maintaining the lowest standards of structural integrity. 

Pay the fucken inspector yourself. First inspection should be simple, make them your friend. Go out for beers and dinner.

Glad hand the fuck out of them. 

Now all your inspections pass with out a hiccup, all the shitty modifications you’ve made with awful material passes, and everyone gets paid. 

You’re going to need to hire a construction coordinator if you haven’t spent a decade around all fields since you won’t truly know how shit is supposed to be built versus how you know they will build it.

In a perfect world shit works nice and fast for a project to finish on time. The world isn’t perfect since most construction laborers are fucken dipshits. Each fuck up slows the next sub down and then all schedules get pushed back. Over and over. 

Need to know a lot. Especially how to treat the help."

2021-04-13 02:46:54,wallstreetbets,Legend
2021-04-13 03:13:01,wallstreetbets,"You did frame this kinda wrong but damn, the hate you get here in top comments is just shit. Just goes to show where WSB was and now is.

These guys aren't even trying to frame it as a joke, it's just sick. 

Hey, guess what... he still bought AT LEAST 10k to infinity below price."
2021-04-13 04:52:47,wallstreetbets,"Congrats and fuck you, that's all you've lost?"
2021-04-13 05:20:59,wallstreetbets,People in the comments believing OP are the real clowns.
2021-04-13 05:32:54,wallstreetbets,\-12% is nothing... it will go back up I guess
2021-04-12 22:38:13,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t tell her neither if I were you. Wait till it’s moon and upgrade her ring as surprise
2021-04-13 03:00:24,wallstreetbets,"Yesterday, I told my wife that the stock price went further down, the sixth day in a row. She is very picky about 'gambling' with our hard earned money and fears losing it.

She asked me ""And, did you manage to buy the dip again?"" 😍"

2021-04-12 22:33:34,wallstreetbets,I think we can short your marriage.
2021-04-12 22:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Only down 15%, get out homie. No need to go down with the ship."
2021-04-12 22:41:34,wallstreetbets,This is more sad than your first post in that you think calling out reckless behavior that endangers the well-being of someone other than you without their consent or knowledge is spite.
2021-04-12 23:08:36,wallstreetbets,How does your wife not know where that money is lol. I don't want to judge another man's marriage but this dynamic confuses me.
2021-04-12 23:21:55,wallstreetbets,She's probably going to be pissed even if you make money.
2021-04-12 23:53:10,wallstreetbets,Is it truly spite if you're actually retarded?

2021-04-13 01:17:31,wallstreetbets,"Well surely the response at least give you clue that that was not a good move. I feel like you don't understand what marriage is supposed to be. No hate, but you should figure that out man. How do you think that would make her feel?"

2021-04-13 08:15:15,wallstreetbets,What pies do they offer you ? Some pecan pie would go along nicely with these losses.

I won't blame her, either."

It’s nice to see apes gather around a bigger purpose, spite differences in color, religion and so on. I wish we could see more of this in general! This is the way!"
2021-04-13 19:12:36,wallstreetbets,"this is such a scumbag thing to do. even when the squeeze happens, the fact you did this without discussing it is messed up.

a big part, if not the biggest part of marriage is trust and communication.

i saw the first post you made and still can’t believe you didn’t tell her.

you probably think the ends will justify the means. people with that mentality say that shit to rationalize what they do or did that was wrong. it’s easier to say that to yourself than deal with the guilt or admit the wrong you did.

that’s your wife, man. how could you do that?

when the tendies come out the oven, i wouldn’t be surprised if she divorces you and takes half. but then again, that’s not for certain.

however, what is, is that she won’t ever be able to trust you ever again."

It's really simple are you non native?"
2021-04-13 06:58:31,wallstreetbets,For now he beats it up every night still
2021-04-13 00:26:57,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. I told my wife about this and her eyes got huge. I manage our finances, and if I took money that was supposed be to going towards our next residence she would freak out. It's a good thing OP has shares instead of options.

If you know you won't need the money for a certain period, the literal safest play is a treasury bond. Instead OP loses 15% almost overnight.

Money issues are a big contributor to divorces and this is a perfect example."
2021-04-13 00:53:21,wallstreetbets,"Not as funny as most replies but its the truth. 

What your doing by not telling your wife about this is considered domestic abuse in some countries since it's financial manipulation."
2021-04-13 10:02:17,wallstreetbets,This dude genuinely believes that his wife will have no reason to be upset if this goes up. Even if it does go up and u make tendies off this play. OPs wife should still leave him.

It’s literally a game of keep away where the goal is to make you lose interest and quit trading stock."
2021-04-13 00:39:58,wallstreetbets,There's a lot of things outside of gambling. Such as one partner earns more than another can create rising tension. Who decides what happens to stimulus or big tax refunds? What about if a big tax debt is owed? What happens when one wants to make a big purchase and the other doesn't think it's a good idea? Don't be so naive.

2021-04-13 10:32:44,wallstreetbets,One is already too much for OP clearly.
2021-04-12 20:31:45,wallstreetbets,"Fair. I did miss that part. 
But gotta admit, puts on his life would be more profitable, because while yes the money is 50/50 split, so losses are 50/50, she is going to end him when she finds out."
2021-04-13 00:41:21,wallstreetbets,Did you just call me naive?
2021-04-13 03:17:17,wallstreetbets,"Here’s the right answer to all that...

Happy wife, happy life!"
2021-04-12 22:49:06,wallstreetbets,Husband >> Bull >> boyfriend >> side piece >> dentist >> autist >> ape
2021-04-12 22:14:42,wallstreetbets,"On top of this, do husband’s boyfriends get to have boyfriends? How deep does the polygamous graph go? Can we get a chain of boyfriends so deep one end hasn’t even met the other?

Can they form a train?"
2021-04-13 12:28:28,wallstreetbets,"Well, Europe is quite large so I'm not sure what the parallell you're trying to make is.

The prices in central Oslo and a small shit hole in Estonia will differ quite alot like you can imagine."
2021-04-12 20:39:55,wallstreetbets,We’ll see
2021-04-13 13:42:48,wallstreetbets,"no they are  roasting the system that thinks women deserve the kids more than men. The system is fucked towards men. Only way a man gets custody is if his ex is document crazy, alcoholic/drugs/ , or has a history of violence. 

Its the career crazys who know how to game the system.

I know this because i put my dick in one of those crazies and has an 8 year old. 9 years to go though!"

2021-04-13 12:37:47,wallstreetbets,California is quite large.
2021-04-13 02:01:26,wallstreetbets,"Dentist in this context is one of those guys who is really confident in his oral skills. He may even be a ""male lesbian."" Women who keep a dentist only ever receive from him, he claims that he just loves going down so much he asks for nothing in return. Almost like a service oriented cuck, but none of the maintenance of regularly humiliating him or outsourcing humiliation to a bull etc.

Oh also, yeah Bull should be somewhere on that chain as well."
2021-04-12 22:43:12,wallstreetbets,B it coin was saved by someone eating ass. Might be onto something here
2021-04-13 02:00:54,wallstreetbets,Yikes. Forgot about that movie until you just made me visualize it!!!

2021-04-12 21:42:23,wallstreetbets,The squeeze happened already buddy. It was the $430+ spike. Anyone going in now is literally throwing away money on a $30 stock.
2021-04-13 12:45:17,wallstreetbets,I can understand that you're confused with that geographical knowledge.
2021-04-12 22:30:09,wallstreetbets,We’ll see
2021-04-13 12:46:10,wallstreetbets,Alright lmao good luck with that energy
2021-04-12 21:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Riddle me this. How is their e-commerce platform going to be highly profitable. How can GME compete with native storefront on Xbox or Playstation. Even if they somehow managed to get an app to sell digital games on the consoles (which is pretty doubtful) they wouldnt be able to compete with the native storefronts because they have to pay xbox or playstation a 30 percent cut for every game they sell. Xbox or playstation also have no incentives to let them do this. So unless they are making a full pivot to PC games, selling console games digitally is going to be a bust for them, and selling physical copies online is a shrinking business.   


Even if they make a full pivot to PC gaming they would be going up against already established  players like steam and Epic games store. Its so hard to get people to switch pc gaming platforms already, what makes you think gamestop will be able to convince people who already own a ton of games on Steam and steam is where all their friends already are to switch. Other than that, they can sell hardware and increasingly move into the hardware space. None of that sounds very  groundbreaking though. Maybe they have a great plan, we just havent heard it yet."
2021-04-13 12:50:50,wallstreetbets,Pick up a map and compare the size of California to Europe instead. Maybe you'll learn something.
2021-04-12 22:44:58,wallstreetbets,How much of the market share do you think they need to capture to be successful? What people seem to miss is.... Not much. They only need a few percent and they're good. Also games aren't the only way forward. Your leaving imagination. Cohen came for the long term play. That's not WSB. But there are plenty of options of thinks to corner in the gaming market. When you sell shit people don't care where it comes from as long as it's a company they want to support. Win the hearts and minds of you customers and you'll be successful.
2021-04-13 12:57:16,wallstreetbets,"Alright here’s what you fail to understand Americans are charged up the ass to live in America, they generally look at Europe as a nicer place to live. Because of the American culture and the way we’re raised into corporate capitalism we assume that means it much cost much more to live in Europe, because we put it on that pedestal of civility. But it’s good to see Europe has both cheap houses, and dumbfucks though. I did learn a lot thanks"
2021-04-13 13:13:45,wallstreetbets,"You still talk like you think Europe is a country or a homogeneous place, hahaha. Do you think Bosnia is the same as Sweden? Read a fucking book. 

Americans and their non American knowledge is just hilarious."
2021-04-13 13:35:37,wallstreetbets,"Well bro idk what to tell you. Sounds like you have a strong prejudice against American people, but maybe you should remember you’re about to make millions off of an American company following the advice of an American individual. I’m certain there’s ignorant people in Europe that only know what they’ve been exposed to, this is the natural human way only combatted by traveling and experiences which most don’t have access to. Good luck I hope America can make you rich"

2021-04-13 10:16:20,wallstreetbets,"A Google search would do you better honestly lol. The CCP probe is over, and there wasn’t any large regulatory action taken. Also, rumor is, BABA will be showcasing an electric car next week."

2021-04-13 10:20:12,wallstreetbets,"Something about how only smart institutional investors are buying in, “smart money” as they’re sometimes called, which usually means they have insider knowledge or better buy-in rates.

2021-04-12 23:17:24,wallstreetbets,Have a look at the week following $GS earnings... nearly universally red even after blowouts. Same is true for most banks reporting this week. So this dude might have made money if he hadn't paper handed every position after reading all this hate (I assume).

2021-04-13 09:03:58,wallstreetbets,"I'm just a retard. I think banks are on a fake bull run and are keeping appearances up until earnings where they will all just die.

I recon most banks are fucked due to the whole GME thing because they've been providing endless liquidity to Hedge Funds, Market Makers and others to just create synthetic GME shares that will eventually need to be covered. I recon all banks are over exposed on GME.

Because i think they are all over exposed on GME and that the Archegos hedge fund is just the first one in a row of hedge funds to blow up, i think banks are already in the red. If not, they will be in the red in the next month or two when they can't keep appearances up anymore.

I'm betting that they will take a massive hit NOW and not later though i'm starting to open puts slightly more far out in case they're going to keep this hype going for a while longer. I think it's all fake and they're in the shitter already.

That or i'm a complete moron."
2021-04-12 22:41:19,wallstreetbets,He's retarded and watched too many 2008 documentaries

2021-04-12 22:52:56,wallstreetbets,"Well that's not necessarily true in the stock market . It is not a zero sum market. The commodities markets are in theory a zero sum but not stock market. I buy, it goes up. I sell to you it goes up.  We both win."

I think you go into your account on fidelity and find transfers and then enter your Robinhood account number they do all the work for you. You can do partial transfer if you want it to go faster or full transfer. My full transfer took 4/5 days. Warning, your fractional shares do not get transferred. 
Edit: I wanted to add it’s a scary time and I’d highly recommend doing a partial transfer. Lots of big things coming up in the next two weeks. You should have time though"

The current echo chamber where people are betting exorbitant amount of money (real or fake) on 7 DTE OTM FD's (there is a reason it has that name) or because they see everyone else here talking about it was never what WSB was about no matter what some people on here will want you to believe.

It's absolutely not riding option contracts to zero. I mean we are retarded. But that's because we buy FD's. Not because we never take profit, till our contracts are worthless and don't have the money to exercise..."

These stocks that I bought were in the billions in terms of the market cap so mods please don't ban me again if one of these stocks drops below a billion. Two bleeped out for obvious reasons. The method to my madness was I clicked on a random stock and then I bought other stocks that other people had in their portfolio through the Robinhood thing on the bottom. I put so little thought into buying these stocks which was not smart in hindsight. There are more stocks in the red on my portfolio, but they are all under 1 billion now so I'm not even going to bother. I hope I wake up soon from this nightmare. Now you must be wondering how did a retard like me get all this money to throw away? I made a lot of money off of Palantir and other various trades, but mostly Palantir."

For the past several weeks volume has been around 2-4M a day, and from 1 to 105pm today 4M shares moved pushing it to 13.67 from open at 12.60ish.  

There is some talk about info that was re-announced today and the CLDR collaboration with NVDA.  But that doesn't seem to make a ton of sense for that move.    


There has been some talk about them being a potential acquisition target. Last year it seemed they were checked out by some VCs to potentially take private, some other boards seem to say things like mongo and snow are snooping around to potentially acquire. Who knows if there is any meat on that bone...  but the reality is options are dirt cheap on this thing.  $15s at the end of the month cost <10c.

With moves like this possible, and somebody moving in and buying 4M shares at whatever price they can at 1pm today... something could be up.  Options volume is a bit higher than usual for them and all bullish.

The stock itself seems like a fairly decent company that's already taken a beating from being tech and having earnings last quarter.... so yeah, they're already low hard to see a lower floor here.

TLDR;  at 1pm today (4/12) somebody bought around 4M shares at whatever price they could.  Reasoning is unclear, but options are cheap and stock is way beaten down if you want to try to buy some lottos on a stock that seems to be decent.

Disclosure: 50 contracts at $15 for 4/23."

The film was showing at 3,084  theaters in North America this past weekend - many of those belonging to public exhibitors, AMC, CNK, and others (whose names apparently cannot be named) and excelling on IMAX screens at all of these chains.

2021-04-12 23:54:15,wallstreetbets,I’m going to see Mortal Kombat at AMC!!!
2021-04-13 02:53:02,wallstreetbets,"You're a bigger ape than King Kong, and I say that with love.

Listen my dear monkeys. In California today, the company that owns and operates Pacific Theatres and Arclight chains handed the keys over to all of their landlords and called it quits. And they did it just as the world is opening up.

Why? Well, it certainly wasn't because the theatrical exhibition business was wine and roses before the pandemic. It sucked, and it was getting worse. Theatrical windows are shrinking in favor of SVOD windows. Profits were getting harder to come by as attendance has been withering for the last fifteen years. 2019 was the third-lowest year in total ticket sales since and including 1995. 2017 was the second-lowest.

AMC is carrying $11 billion in convertible and non-convertible debt on its books. In May, its shareholders will vote to approve issuing 500 million shares of class A stock. This would give AMC cash to maneuver and operate but at the cost of diluting the share price. If AMC does not issue the stock, its ability to manage its debt and continue its operations will be severely limited.

As of March, the short positions are about 11% of outstanding/floating shares, so this isn't a short squeeze scenario.

While I appreciate everyone's enthusiasm for liking the stock, I fear this is not going to turn out the way you want.

I wish my fellow apes luck, and I am praying for you."

Anyone that thinks it's not a good movie is in the minority on this one. I myself went to see it and enjoyed it. Didn't think it was amazing or great. But, it was by no means close to bad. It was solid 7/10 for me. It's a Giant monster movie. It's meant to be mainly fun  spectacular, and they delivered in that regard, in a good way."

Looks like the next issue of the New England Journal of Medicine will have the Head-to-head with Psilocybin+SSRI vs. SSRI, to be released April 14th at 5 PM.

SSRIs are standard treatment for patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). One of the leaders of this study posted on Twitter last week and is teasing us

[https://twitter.com/RCarhartHarris/status/1380049694953512960?s=20](https://twitter.com/RCarhartHarris/status/1380049694953512960?s=20)

What's interesting is that the lead for this study is Dr. David Nutt, who also Leads CMPS' advisory board [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03429075?term=psilocybin&draw=3&rank=22](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03429075?term=psilocybin&draw=3&rank=22)

What's even more interesting is that CMPS was recently granted patents for this exact use case of psilocybin

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/23/2197644/0/en/COMPASS-Pathways-granted-two-US-patents.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/23/2197644/0/en/COMPASS-Pathways-granted-two-US-patents.html)

And finally, **it looks like CMPS has scheduled a 'corporate update' the morning after NEJM results will be published i.e. April 15 8 AM ET**

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/09/2207367/0/en/COMPASS-Pathways-plc-to-participate-in-20th-Annual-Needham-Virtual-Healthcare-Conference.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/09/2207367/0/en/COMPASS-Pathways-plc-to-participate-in-20th-Annual-Needham-Virtual-Healthcare-Conference.html)

2021-04-12 23:41:48,wallstreetbets,"RC doesn’t have the votes to force it.

But the way a CEO ""should"" care about the stock price is by leading the company into becoming something that justfies a high valuation. I know GameStop might seem overvalued now, but believe it or not - it can potentially be worth even more, with the right trasformation and leadership."

2021-04-12 20:41:13,wallstreetbets,"I'll be honest & say that beyond they just beginning to understand that digital is the way forward I don't know exactly what their plan is. Because if it's just an online retailer shipping discs I think that will also be something which will be declining in the future. Neither developers nor platform holders really want the disc system to continue, not only due to cutting costs of actually physically producing them & shipping them, but also because second hand sales is something that side of the business doesn't want to exist. From a consumer POV it's also more convenient to just download & buy it directly, especially as internet speeds are ever increasing. At that point GME would either need to have their own digital distribution platform, but most hardware is already locked down by vendor monopoly on that end. Desktop is the outlier, but that's already pretty locked down at the moment as well, GME *could* perhaps make a dent there, but i think it would be very hard.

As for the physical side of things, Amazon as you say already exists, I'm not in the US though & we already buy from our own selected few online retailers on that end, so I don't really know enough on that end. The question becomes if they can take over enough of that segment to warrant their current valuation though, which from my understanding is still pretty dependent on the game side of things."
2021-04-13 11:28:08,wallstreetbets,"I think the Gaming Lounge concept would be a welcomed idea and a great opportunity to socialize after a year of Covid!  Converting old brick and mortar to profitable space AND continue to use it for limited product sales.  Also, GameStop SHOULD expand their market foothold and become a gaming development company which could have a proprietary game concept development division, game manufacturing, and proprietary accessory supply division, making GameStop not only a retail seller but also a game creator, developer and even limited manufacturer.  They could hire away some of the best game developers and, through customer feedback, create legendary games that their gaming base wants to play. They would have a near monopoly in the gaming industry!  RC is hopefully not just thinking out of the box, but out of many big boxes and can see the unlimited potential for GameStop!"

The bigger issue for the company is the huge hit their cash reserves are going to take paying the taxes on all those shares.  That was already going to be a problem, because that was the real focus of the 10-K discussion, and now that number is even bigger with Sherman's shares.  They better hope the price drops considerably in the coming days."

You seem to be struggling so I'll spell it out.  George Sherman was nominated for a board position. Because of this, it was further evidence he was likely to be ousted as CEO.  He is still nominated to the board because he brings a wealth of knowledge and experience in specific areas."

I’m sure it’s inflated somewhat and heavily influenced by location and social standing, but average base salary for an entry-level software engineer in the US is around $70k+ depending on which source you look at.

I don’t think my goal is unreasonable to achieve in the next few years, barring another major economic catastrophe. This job took me 8 months to find after graduating though, so I’m really banking on the experience I gain here helping in my next search.

All anyone wants to talk about is core count and them being beat to 7nm, but they just blatantly ignore scalable xeons and transistor density.

Intel's 14 and 10nm chipsets are competing against 7nm chips, because they have greater density, among other things, and their shift towards big.little for general computer is gonna get real interesting.

Not to mention their insane amounts of investment in storage.  You can have infinite compute power, but if you can't access the data quickly enough you may as well throw half your cores in the trash.

Intel is playing a LOOOOOOOONG game and the only thing people want to talk about is core count on Ryzen.

The fuck are you going to do on 64 cores?  Leave them all dark because your chips would melt otherwise.

Edit: Oh and they could very well be moving towards a foundry model as they dump 10s of billions into producing new fabs."

Both Intel and Nvidia have done this.  You know anything about the server market?  Same situation there, thanks to Intel having a HUGE lead and huge market share, while the top of the line was something like $5k back when AMD was competing with Opterons, now Intel can and will offer you a $10000 chip.

I don't know if any of you realize this, but Reddit.com doesn't use AI, nor does 99.999999999999999% of the web that currently ""uses server chips"".  Great, so Nvidia is getting into the low to no margin ""self driving cars"" market, similarly to AMD when they got into the low margin consol markets, it will be great to talk about during presentations but it will not being in major money, there are going to be too many companies doing it in house or preferring to put Apple's AI into their car, because your average person that isn't a nerd knows what Apple is brand wise but doesn't give a fuck about whatever an Nvidia is.  
  
And Nvidia branded ARM chips?  Great, throw it on the pile with the other 30 manufacturers of them.  Same story as above, unless Nvidia does something truly amazing they will AT BEST be on par with Apple's ARM with regards to AI and predictive computing, which Apple already has in working laptops people own, so you know, quite a lead there.

New stock has not been issued that would account for the downward trend.

An acquisition is theoretically great for long term health. But is part of business activity that has no direct impact to stock price beyond speculative trading. With said “acquisition” you might see a price increase due to more people betting on the success of AMD... but you didn’t so...

I specifically said that fundamentals AREN’T the sole factor in determining stock price. Yet you defend it with... fundamentals. LOL

2021-04-13 10:17:13,wallstreetbets,"man, had sell order at 1.50 entered but cancelled and replaced to 1.75 was confident AMD will continue upward but shortly after i replaced order SP started to go down so in the hole now; we'll see what develops"
2021-04-13 09:37:55,wallstreetbets,And we’re back what price you selling??
2021-04-13 09:34:15,wallstreetbets,"thank you, sir, for a very helpful answer."
2021-04-13 17:11:44,wallstreetbets,"Update: sold the put gained almost my buy in today. Still about 2k short . But I believe this week it will def hit $85

But man have u seen Tesla? Wish I have my $680 calls I sold on Monday morning"

2021-04-13 10:19:34,wallstreetbets,"had sell order at 1.50 ask entered, pretty sure it got there but last min cancelled and replaced to 1.75 and SP now in downtrend, so in the hole by about 1.5K; so need to wait a bit ..."
2021-04-12 20:13:46,wallstreetbets,"Don't write contracts unless you have the capital or shares to back it up.  If you sell a call contract and you get assigned then you have to cough up a 100 shares.  So if you wanna trade options I would start with the basics and just buy and sell options.  Start with small options to play around with, maybe on a paper trading account.  Buy to open, then sell the contract you bought then you have no risk for assignment.  Selling to open when you aren't completely sure what you're doing is dangerous."
2021-04-13 18:02:29,wallstreetbets,"right on.. but yes $TSLA!!! - keeps on truckin' that thing, i just briefly looked at it, got myself new opportunity today $AHOC May calls - don't know anything about the CO just know it dropped like 20% on news that Co-CEO got formerly charged w tax fraud - in Denmark, for some personal tax matters i guess back in 2014-15 so i jumped on them calls and been following almost all day to get as many as i can afford that and watching AMD, wanted to sell some CC's for my 800 AMD shares for this FR but really did not get the ask i was looking for - tomorrow - hump day looking to see if AMD runs up a little close/above that $80.50 strike of mine in the AM if market co-operates"

2021-04-13 13:01:21,wallstreetbets,"been watching AMD for years - it's not unusual for it to swing/gyrate $1-$2 couple of times per day, so yes - looking for bounce especially considering it barely recovered what it gave up yesterday also considering SP was in optimistic uptrend before NVDA news..."
2021-04-13 13:03:28,wallstreetbets,Are you planning on holding h Tim tomorrow if we don’t get to target price or are you just gonna take the lost?
2021-04-13 13:10:58,wallstreetbets,if need be i say i'm willing to hold until at least tomorrow morning; imo if market is conditions are favorable AMD tends to run up in the AM; after tomorrow morning i say theta/time decay will start to eat up at the option value so yes will be considering selling at loss rather than holding till Friday...
2021-04-13 13:31:00,wallstreetbets,we just need a little more cow bell!!!

2021-04-12 20:02:21,wallstreetbets,I constantly try to imagine what could happen or would have happened with gme if everyone bought gme instead of amc and other stuff.. the world will never know.
2021-04-13 03:58:29,wallstreetbets,500 mil shares are coming.
2021-04-12 20:47:12,wallstreetbets,Gme is a safer bet...
2021-04-12 21:58:29,wallstreetbets,Love how this was not deleted my wsb mods only due to your large position. They HATE amc talk and ban the fuck out of it.
2021-04-12 20:22:18,wallstreetbets,Ever consider FAS option? JP Morgan reports Wednesday.

2021-04-13 09:13:54,wallstreetbets,I literally have 500@9.13 and i couldn't be more confident
2021-04-12 23:32:27,wallstreetbets,Absolutely!!!

🚀"
2021-04-13 11:19:41,wallstreetbets,Good morning so far. Bought like 60 more on the dip. Didn't quite get in at 8.4 :/
2021-04-12 21:59:22,wallstreetbets,Nice job on the epaulets but could you suggest  a revamp the polo shirts at the next costumer meeting?
2021-04-13 03:59:34,wallstreetbets,"What a simple opinion 😂. How about you look up the DD on AMC instead of regurgitating misinformation.

Both stocks are “meming” and the vote isn’t until May. With majority of shares being owned by retail investors. The people."
2021-04-13 05:08:08,wallstreetbets,"Wtf lol. No CEO can save a dying business. Gamestop has nothing to offer, streaming? SONY, Microsoft and steam already do that. You think Sony or Microsoft are gonna release any exclusives to gamestop if they decide to get into streaming ? I really hope GME people make money, but for those saying GME has a shot to grow as a company are truly retards. Not financial advice"
2021-04-13 00:21:11,wallstreetbets,Why
2021-04-12 21:38:56,wallstreetbets,GME also has more potential for a massive drop though.
2021-04-12 20:55:13,wallstreetbets,GME is as certain has HAM BOT VER 🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-13 00:47:53,wallstreetbets,Saaweet
2021-04-12 22:18:35,wallstreetbets,"Hey, it's not fault that gme's business model is more reliable in the long run. Movie theaters are on the way out sadly and I hate it but that's how it is with everything moving to streaming"
2021-04-12 23:02:48,wallstreetbets,"I have to time, i just pay a % to short and keep open but i have a big bankroll"
2021-04-13 00:46:18,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't have the same extreme shorting, and it doesnt have remotely the same possibility of rebounding into a successful business.  AMC will be the same it was before, a mediocre business drowning in debt, but Cohen is actually trying to turn Gamestop into something successful"
2021-04-12 21:49:05,wallstreetbets,Not really if you do the DD
2021-04-12 23:03:22,wallstreetbets,Good.......good
2021-04-12 22:14:55,wallstreetbets,"
So, there is no more hope about squeeze?😠.
APES are holding for nothing?😠.
Fu***g Hedgies 😠 win?😠.
No, APES Army stronger together
We can win.
AMC to the moon, 🚀🚀🚀🚀."
2021-04-13 01:31:57,wallstreetbets,"This is a good argument. But why would the CEO actively sabotage the future of the company he's running by knowingly screwing over their share holders and customers by actively preventing the possibility of a squeeze with share dilution?

He's got a solid resume. I really have a hard time believing he is acting in bad faith. WSB saved the company essentially, and he knows this."
2021-04-13 12:39:53,wallstreetbets,"Hi Elmer Fudd, crawl back to your desk job at Shitadel."
2021-04-13 10:19:58,wallstreetbets,"> have to time, i just pay a % to short and keep open but i have a big bankrol

It actually has way more shorting than GME Dude...."
2021-04-12 20:37:22,wallstreetbets,"You don’t want to sell covered calls if you’re trying to get that squeeze value... in fact, you’re gonna lose that extra money when it goes above the strike price...."
2021-04-12 21:49:07,wallstreetbets,"This was the only reason AMC became a thing to begin with. People who missed GME wanted a low cost stock to “squeeze”. Same with SNDL.. and so on and so on.. ad nosium.. 

Really bad strategy, but I get the illusion of “hey I can get so many more of these!”"
2021-04-13 07:14:56,wallstreetbets,You're a idiot if you think the squeeze has anything to do with their revenue... look at the price before the pandemic
2021-04-12 20:32:46,wallstreetbets,"If it’s ~~red~~ gray I buy, if it’s ~~green~~ gray I buy"
2021-04-12 23:03:48,wallstreetbets,Much the same
2021-04-13 11:54:17,wallstreetbets,Colorblind tard here. I made and lost 300k this year already. So about how you'd imagine.
2021-04-12 21:25:10,wallstreetbets,"some short positions have been held for years, over five in some extreme examples, so yeah they technically never have to cover as long as they're willing to eat the interest fee. remember, short positions do not expire(unless the borrowed shares come with special conditions but we're going to keep this simple), and buying puts isn't exactly shorting. days to cover is how long it would take for the amount of shares shorted to be bought back based on the average volume a stock has and is not an expiration date."
2021-04-13 13:26:00,wallstreetbets,"How could it possibly squeeze with 450,000,000 shares outstanding and another 500,000,000 incoming?"
2021-04-13 04:21:26,wallstreetbets,"I doubt these guys are banking the future of their company on a potential squeeze. That'd just be bad practice. If he can dilute the shares at an already significantly higher share price than what the business would usually be worth without all this WSB attention, and secure himself a big fat paycheck in the process, he's going to do it."
2021-04-12 21:35:38,wallstreetbets,"Theres only 1 mama, and its mama Su"
2021-04-13 13:08:40,wallstreetbets,"You know you can check someone's post history, right? You think I made this account 9 years ago with the hopes of being able to influence the market today?"
2021-04-13 10:55:27,wallstreetbets,"Not sure what reefer you're smoking but amc only has 11% short of the float versus 44.6% of the float for GME.

AMC has more shares shorted but that's only because they have a much higher stock amount.  By percentage they were muchhh lower"
2021-04-13 03:07:31,wallstreetbets,"It was a challenge to the claim that 10 shares of an expensive stock are equivalent to 100 shares of a cheaper stock. They’re not the same, because the 10 more expensive stock have less flexibility (because you can’t use them to sell a covered call)."
2021-04-13 01:08:05,wallstreetbets,If they squeezed and made money then it wasn't a bad strategy. The bad strategy is not having an exit strategy and bag holding.
2021-04-12 20:35:12,wallstreetbets,"Literally none of you assholes gave a shit about GME back in December. Looking through deepfuckingvalue's previous posts, it's just full of asshole LAUGHING at him. And now you think you're a big time investor because you're riding on his coat tails? 

Tell me, what was the price of gamestop stock before all this mess? How many stores were they closing? Remember, before all this happened (which is not natural, by the way) hedgies were betting on this company going belly up. And they would've been right. 

Gamestop was a failing business that got lucky. That's it.

Edit: hey so, if I'm going to get downvoted without any actual discussion, I'll say this. 

Your man, Ryan Cohen's has zero experience in the video game industry. He's already kicked out Reggie, the former president of NINTENDO. Ya know, a company of value. Y'all are betting on him performing some miracle by making Gamestop the ""Amazon of games"" but that market already exists. It's called Steam. If you knew anything about the video game industry, you'd already know the hostility that gamers have towards the Epic games store. So, what makes Gamestop different or special in this regard? Not to mention that gamers absolutely hate Gamestop. So, there's a lot of good will that they're going to have to garner in order for anyone to buy their products. 

The market for online gaming is already flooded, what exactly are they going to bring to the table? Another platform where we have to download their shitty app in order to play it? Better hope there's no DRM because that will NOT go over well. But hey, at least he's good at selling dog food? 

Edit: a day later. 

Something I've just thought about. There are people who like to own physical copies of their games. And then there are those who don't care and are happy to buy digital only. 

So, let's focus on physical purchases. If they're really trying to be the ""Amazon of games,"" then they're going to have to be better at Amazon at delivering these games. Has gamestop spent the last couple decades building infrastructure to make same day delivery a thing? Are they going to be able to offer low or no shipping costs? I am all for a competitor to Amazon because they are in a dangerous place of being a monopoly. If gamestop wants to compete, what are they going to do differently? 

Digital purchases. What will they offer that's different from stores like Humble Bundle, GOG, Steam, Origin or Epic Games? Microsoft Game pass is literally netflix for gaming. To name a few. What exactly is their niche here? What are they doing differently? And where are they planning on selling these games? Because I doubt that Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft are going to give them room on their eshops. 

Ryan Cohen carved out a niche in the market because there was no competitor competent enough to do what Chewy did. I'm not denying that. That was a smart way of doing business and he succeeded in making his niche WORK. A fast, cheap and convenient way for pet owners to get pet supplies. I'm invested in Chewy because it is a good buy. 

Also, I hear they're going into cloud gaming. How will this be different than Google Stadia? Or any of the other countless video game streaming companies? I heard Microsoft is behind it, but then, that's Microsoft. Not gamestop.

E-sports? Really? Man, I hope they offer huge incentives for streamers because that market is ALREADY flooded. 

Gamestop was a failing business during a time when it's online revenue was up 300%. AMC had to go into debt to survive when it's revenue was cut by 100%. Despite that all of that, Gamestop was still failing. It was trading in the single digits. AMC, despite all odds, was still able to survive. So, what was Gamestops excuse?"
2021-04-13 11:45:15,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't implying he is banking on the squeeze for his company. But it seems share holders are mostly voting no on the share dilution anyway. So regardless, I don't think it is even an issue. 
We'll see come May 4."
2021-04-12 20:38:36,wallstreetbets,You don’t want to sell contracts if you’re trying to get that squeeze value......
2021-04-13 00:30:56,wallstreetbets,Big yikes. Did you short GME you poor soul xx

2021-04-12 21:12:06,wallstreetbets,It's all I could see because when you use a 4K TV and 2 other monitors you HAVE to be good at finding the cursor.

2021-04-13 01:08:05,wallstreetbets,"Not sure what that means, but I noticed something highly unusual about this sub today. It wasn't plastered with GME threads. I find this quite curious and I'm leaning strongly toward losing my money on puts again."

2021-04-13 03:59:40,wallstreetbets,You could also use the even older man who plays a fairly small role-- (link here for example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XegOczOvfXY&ab\_channel=JesseAndRachel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XegOczOvfXY&ab_channel=JesseAndRachel)) Could use him to represent the SEC or even the hospitals that ppl donated to lol.

2021-04-13 03:44:56,wallstreetbets,Pltr at the top yet it will remain around 25 per share for eternity 😅

2021-04-13 01:48:00,wallstreetbets,PLTR = what is this?   Flare for GME?
2021-04-13 01:12:24,wallstreetbets,"Indeed, post is pretty sus."
2021-04-13 00:46:55,wallstreetbets,ASO is about to Moon. It was one of the few in the green today. 🚀🚀🚀

2021-04-12 20:52:52,wallstreetbets,Okay bud that’s enough for today
2021-04-13 00:27:58,wallstreetbets,I wish there was a sub that was like WSB was before this GME bullshit and explicitly banned any mention of GME or AMC.
2021-04-12 20:26:55,wallstreetbets,Beep. I *beep* own *beep* 9000 shares of *beep* PLTR. Beep boop beep fuck you.
2021-04-13 13:23:58,wallstreetbets,"All the subs are ""compromised"" the same way, ss is compromised as hell as much as all the other subs."
2021-04-13 09:50:39,wallstreetbets,"It's not a misprint the actual number of existing shares can increase with shorts. Check the 10 biggest holders and you will see for yourself. 
There is a reason for the voting right to be transferred away from the lender of a stock and for the pay in lieu systems. 
Check the 13-F filings of the 10 biggest holders and prove me wrong."
2021-04-13 10:00:10,wallstreetbets,"Well, it is something everyone knows. Just focus on the price action and chart direction. Don't get married to one trade imo.  I just bought MAR and F puts yesterday and I'm killing it. I had puts in GME but I'm out and clearly the guy that gave me my profits is making a few hundred himself :)"
2021-04-12 20:08:30,wallstreetbets,You go ahead and look about.  I think MTN is one.  GME has broken every technical indicator Monthly Weekly and Daily charts. I just made 100%+ gain on my put trade and sadly I cashed them too quickly.  The squeeze happened and I'm sorry to say that everyone has become emotionally attached to the trade and that is usually leads to horrible losses.  It is supposed to be WallStreetBets but it has been overtaken by talk of one stock mooning that already mooned.  We really need to diversify the discussion or everyone is going to be broke and WSB will be forever hurt by that.
2021-04-12 20:49:39,wallstreetbets,Advance Auto 💀
2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm betting that $ASO catalyst (JP Morgan Investor Conference) this week will lead to strong price action this week There's been a lot of DD surrounding ASO recently (I wrote one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mi07tr/dd_aso_options_ladder_is_enticing_high_short/) when it was $28.34, it has jumped up 10-20% since) corresponding to a 30% jump in price in the last month. With the current short interest at \~40% (almost all of which are underwater since they were borrowed when ASO was around $26 while the current price is hovering around $31) and the catalyst of the [JPM Investor Retail Conference](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/academy-sports-outdoors-announces-participation-222500004.html)  that they were invited to present at, which could expose this underrated stock to eager whales.

&#x200B;

[SI Interest as of 4\/12\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/zibna131srs61.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cd69d01b3947437e451219cd4a5865fc14249a2)

We could see a run upwards (due to media hype + retail hype, ASO is the second highest trending ticker on WSB some days) that puts pressure on shorts to cover. From the retail conference in 2020 (can't find for years before this), Lowes and Urban Outfitters presented, and in the week after their downward descents reversed and the stocks were up 17% and 32% respectively so there is light evidence that presentation at the retail conference can correlate to positive movement.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/swiaanadurs61.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e9e052f372e0dcd9f0e518950f31feab11ceceb

Along w/ all the other positive points (killed earnings, low P/e compared to industry peers such as Dicks, huge underwater short interest) I think this could spark another jump in $ASO's price as more heavy hitting investors are exposed to the stock and jump on board coupled with shorts covering due to no hope of the stock dropping to the prices they borrowed at.

Positions: 200 04/16C $30"
2021-04-12 22:34:24,wallstreetbets,I hope before Friday - I have a call expiring and I'm $200 down. Small potatoes to you apes but I'm more of a howler monkey
2021-04-13 17:38:19,wallstreetbets,I'm excited to see what Wednesday brings.
2021-04-12 20:58:31,wallstreetbets,"I put up 2 posts in r/options as WSB likes deleting my posts ... I agree and have  a position.  Also , The Retail Sales numbers come out this week on Thursday and call for -3% .. How can we have -3% when I keep having to pay double for shit at the stores I shop ... Go ASO! Guns & Ammo for the Revolution! I think we the market tops early May ... or possibly now. Look at a Weekly chart of Ford.. So many companies have rallied hard but have no hopes of turning profits in the near future."
2021-04-13 15:08:55,wallstreetbets,Sorry it was hard to read because I couldn't find any rockets but I'll probably get in on some options before that conference tomorrow!
2021-04-12 23:25:05,wallstreetbets,My 4/16 35c have been red since I bought them 2 weeks ago after reading some DD here. I'm running out of time. I hope you're right.
2021-04-13 02:58:02,wallstreetbets,"Ugh, I'd go in if the premiums were a bit cheaper. Only 3 to choose from and they are all too rich for my blood. I hope it rips and whoever buys them gets dem dish tendies tho."
2021-04-13 10:18:36,wallstreetbets,why is there so much short interest on a seemingly solid non-meme stonk?
2021-04-12 23:43:20,wallstreetbets,So I can go in Tuesday or nah?
2021-04-13 03:07:43,wallstreetbets,"I mean, what are the chances of a big run up like this triggering a squeeze? Are they ok, good or very good?"
2021-04-13 07:03:21,wallstreetbets,"I'm just sad I couldn't get options on ASO, because I'm in Europe I guess?

&#x200B;

Got 50 shares @ 25 though, and pretty happy about that."
2021-04-12 22:38:57,wallstreetbets,I'm in at $40 call at 2.50 apiece lol...
2021-04-12 21:01:18,wallstreetbets,"I waited too ... Just entered my trade the other day when it broke out of the range. Look at a monthly chart and have no fear. This has a trend and that trend is up. Check out my 2 posts and charts. Not late imo as I'm looking at adding on Friday.. If you wait for $40 , you are chasing lol"
2021-04-12 21:02:45,wallstreetbets,You are an optimistic one. I have May Calls $30 strike and hoping for $40 by end of month.
2021-04-12 23:33:46,wallstreetbets,"I have 8 $40 calls expiring this Friday, that would be great."
2021-04-12 21:03:50,wallstreetbets,And the weekly has sustained Bullish RSI since the IPO ! Hold on to 69 weekly RSI and she should just keep trucking along.
2021-04-12 23:26:23,wallstreetbets,Same. Mine's been red since I bought it. Patiently waiting but running out of time...
2021-04-12 21:03:37,wallstreetbets,do you have a source on the retail sales numbers coming out? that's interesting
2021-04-12 23:49:22,wallstreetbets,Retail numbers should be good because of all the stimulus checks that went out and people getting their tax returns. Been seeing a lot of buying at Walmart and Target this last month or more
2021-04-13 18:07:59,wallstreetbets,"May 21 35c are a nice price. I’d say 40 is a bit too greedy. If you want to do 40 I’d do October, premiums are high but you get the benefit of another earnings. ASO always dips in the morning and bottoms out around 10 eastern, if you wanna pick up calls pick em up then."
2021-04-13 11:33:34,wallstreetbets,"They had super high debt, earnings estimates were half what they are now meaning the stock would theoretically be fairly valued or even overvalued, and futurists believe in a near term total collapse of brick and mortar stores.

They are beginning to pay down debt,  earnings are double what was estimated, and Academy parking lots are always occupied."
2021-04-13 11:30:52,wallstreetbets,"There will definitely be a small squeeze, but plenty of people are ready to sell at $40, so it won't be monumental."
2021-04-13 11:27:34,wallstreetbets,"I'd say slim chances there. $37.20 would represent a 20% gain from where it's at, and that is a giant move."
2021-04-12 21:01:45,wallstreetbets,"Same, but it was the only stock that I bet would go up :)"
2021-04-12 21:09:19,wallstreetbets,This one is easier to read : https://www.marketwatch.com/economy-politics/calendar

2021-04-13 10:06:14,wallstreetbets,"Well , hope so as it needs some help. Getting attacked today. Whomever sold all those $30 calls that expire at end of week is acting desperate here. When you are losing a bet, throw more money at it. That is what it looks like for these shorts. If this closes at $30.25 or higher this week Calls are gonna print."
2021-04-12 20:47:39,wallstreetbets,"^^

I have $40 calls but they don't expire until October"
2021-04-12 23:20:18,wallstreetbets,Limits your upside. Why would you want that if hyper bullish?
2021-04-13 12:01:55,wallstreetbets,"Welppp, looks like my first option purchase is not going to end well. Live and learn I suppose!"
2021-04-13 16:32:26,wallstreetbets,I called this my casino trade. I’m ok with losing the premium
2021-04-12 23:37:42,wallstreetbets,"I like the idea of having a clear risk/reward profile. Also, the lowered cost basis makes the $5 wide brackets less awkward. Unless you think it will run significantly above $45 this week, I think you would get a better risk/reward using call debit spreads vs calls in this particular instance."
2021-04-13 12:34:58,wallstreetbets,"The WSB community loves the options culture, but there's a lot to be said for actually owning the company rather than an optional contract."

2021-04-12 23:40:45,wallstreetbets,"I know for a fact Uber drivers and other gig workers already do. My delivery guy had the Uber sticker on his car, and grabbed the weed out of an Uber Eats bag. I mean they get paid shit money, if it makes good money and is another delivery gig, why wouldn't they?

Where I am it's not illegal, but it certainly isn't *legal*. But that doesn't stop them from same-day delivery. Hell, depending on the time I can get a ounce of weed in the same amount of time it takes to get food from a delivery service. 

Honestly weed delivery is just an easier business. With food, you can usually only get away with one delivery at a time, and you might go to many different places. Go to the restaurant, get the food, go drop it off, repeat. With weed, you just pick up a shit-ton prepackaged early, and can drive from customer to customer rarely needing to pick up. And you're only ever picking up from the same place, no need to figure out where you're going every single time."

2021-04-13 13:16:31,wallstreetbets,People like having drugs delivered because they don’t want to worry about getting pulled over.  Once it is legal and people are selling it at gas stations drug delivery will no longer be a thing.

2021-04-12 23:53:36,wallstreetbets,"I partially agree, but that causes issues. Lets just ignore the part where drug users can cause harm to other people around them, be it destroying a family, or leading to crime to continue their habit; that's a social/police issue, not a drug related one. That could be solved.

The issue is, if you blow all your money cause you're addicted to heroin, is it fair for you to receive the same amount of welfare as someone else? If you want to *choose* to do hard drugs cool, but once it becomes the responsibility of the taxpayer, society has some right to say ""no"". I live in a country with free (at the point of service) healthcare. If someone ODs on a regular basis, should I really be paying their hospital bills for something entirely preventable that they themselves caused?

At least with something like smoking and lung cancer, you could say you can't be *sure* their bad habits caused it. But a drug overdose is pretty clear, and it's fairly obvious you wouldn't need that same expensive care if you didn't fuck around with dangerous substances. If people are responsible enough to decide whether they should/shouldn't do drugs, then they should also be responsible for any reasonable consequences that occur. 

I'm fine if you wanna do coke daily if you're still a functioning member of society, but if you start shooting up heroin, missing work, get fired, and need to stay in public housing and survive off welfare, why should we reward bad behaviour by taking financial responsibility?"

2021-04-12 23:44:00,wallstreetbets,"Yup, it's certainly a good business model... but only for the theatre companies. Moviepass was never going to do well, the Movie Theatres could refuse to sign deals, revoke their ability to sell tickets (unless they paid full price - ouch) and just replicate what they did for easy money.

I certainly think it'll be a thing in the future, a subscription to the movie theatre is good competition with streaming services, and a customer base exists. But obviously it's more profitable when the company selling you the subscription is the same one selling tickets... a middle-man is just gonna struggle to make a profit, because they probably pay a similar price whether the seat is empty or not."

2021-04-12 23:59:52,wallstreetbets,Keeping it illegal has done everything you just said. At least we can use the tax money from those sales for some actual good.
2021-04-13 08:12:09,wallstreetbets,"You understand that when drugs are legalised, they can become extremely cheap AND high quality..... right? 

The whole argument that addict's need to steal to support their habit is a result of drugs being illegal and highly profitable for criminal enterprises to be servicing that high risk demand. 

In countries that have made the change what in reality happens is there is a SLIGHT uptick in users in the 1st few years, then a steady decline in long term addicts as they can more easily access support services and a marked drop in NEW users as real drug education is readily available instead of the BS scare tactics traditionally used.  

That's in a system were the government take over supply and distribution AND put some of the profits back into support services, education and harm minimisation.  It actually ends up costing the country LESS. 

It seems counter intuitive because we have been told all our lives that drug users are a ""burden"" on society..... which of course they are under a system that makes drugs illegal and let's criminals take huge profits out of the countries system while leaving the country footing the bill for the social costs!

As for your comment about smoking, the science is VERY clear that it causes a HEAP of healthcare costs that are shared by wider society.... the difference being that some of those costs are offset by taxing the product at point of sale. 

The same health costs can be clearly seen with obesity and unhealthy food..... why am I forced to pay for people's heart attacks because they personally choose to eat fatty and high sugar diets then have heart attacks! They made the CHOICE to eat in that way...... but why is it acceptable that wider society then shares the burden of their health care costs but not share the costs of drug users? 

The same for welfare, plenty of people on welfare smoke and eat terrible food and we are paying them so they can continue in their choices. Why should there be a double standard?"

2021-04-12 22:31:15,wallstreetbets,"I think we'll see a downtrend, though.  Theaters have a big incentive to find a new, working model, while Hollywood's safest bet is to go down with the ship, at least until they can convince people to pay theater like prices to watch new movies at home."
2021-04-12 23:48:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, partially because they couldn't sign good deals with the theatre companies. They did in the beginning, and that was pretty successful... but the theatres realized they could just undercut Moviepass and do it themselves.

Moviepass still had to buy those tickets, even at a discounted rate. But the theatres themselves? They don't care, as long as they aren't displacing too many ticket-buyers. It creates brand loyalty, and since almost every movie you go to has empty seats (save for the big releases) it's free money for them. 

Moviepass could've been sustainable if they stayed small and mostly under the radar, but the VC greed for expansion meant they stepped on the toes of the movie theatres their business relied on. After that, they were screwed. You can't have a mutually beneficial relationship when they realize your entire business-model is built on a product that is theirs, and they know it's popular enough that it's not risky."
2021-04-13 07:27:25,wallstreetbets,Then they were trying to sell your data and not say anything. I figured it out after analyzing their traffic. Moviepass agreed to keep my card open until they died in exchange for not suing the hell out of them.

2021-04-13 15:34:54,wallstreetbets,">Why should there be a double standard?

I never said there should be... the difference is for something like Lung cancer you can't prove causation. With a drug overdose, you absolutely can.

I mean, I specifically brought up ODs for a reason and you didn't mention it once. No amount of harm reduction will completely stop ODs from occurring, and it's pretty fucking clear what caused an OD.

Having tax dollars go towards ODs would still piss people off. Yes, it will have tax income from those sales... but that doesn't change the fact that tax dollars are going towards it to some extent. If you could guarantee that all those OD cases and terrible outcomes would be funded *exclusively* by the taxes on drugs, that wouldn't be a problem; but that simply isn't the case.

>but why is it acceptable that wider society then shares the burden of their health care costs but not share the costs of drug users?

Neither is acceptable, that's my point. My whole point is both should be treated equivalently, we just don't because we all agree the negative health outcomes of eating too much junk food is nowhere near as dangerous as ODing on fentanyl... Or any other drug that either kills you, or leaves long-term damage requiring constant medical care for the rest of your life."

2021-04-13 19:13:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm not disagreeing with you about welfare and healthy food but the point I was making is that currently, obese people are free to keep making poor health choices with welfare money and society keeps picking up their healthcare costs.  

Its a double standard to accept that but then turn around and deny drug addicts welfare because they will/might spend it of drugs. 

Either BOTH are wrong...... or BOTH are right! I really don't care which side someone's opinion falls on, just be consistent and don't have a double standard! I get why it happens, we all have things we personally accept that others may not but if we are being honest with ourselves there are multiple situations around welfare and supporting poor personal choices that are the same concept. Yet when it comes to drug use, pretty universally we have all been taught ""drugs are bad"" and on a base level to hate drugs/drug use and that bleeds over to hate for drug users. 

Also, I'm not against SOME of the profits from drug sales going to schools, roads, tech and so on....... but that's also my FEAR that especially in the US political system were BOTH parties will see government supply and distribution of drugs as an extremely lucrative tax stream that they cant help themselves and give the supply and distribution rights to the private sector PLUS tax the hell out of it at point of sale and we go from a system of illegal high priced drugs to a system of legal high priced drugs.... Then couple that with both parties NOT investing any of the drug tax $ back into harm minimisation, support services, drug education and so on. Instead spending those sweet new tax $ on areas sure to get them re-election and we end up with a system that NEEDS to ensure drug users continue to be drug users and more importantly creates NEW drug users! 

Such a system would end up not decreasing crime related to drug use..... but in all likelihood INCREASE drug related crime as addicts still steal to support their high priced drug habit AND have virtually no support services to reach out to and start getting off drugs. 

To see real benefits from a shift in drug policy, governments really need to stop and approach this issue in a fundamentally different way! It can't be viewed with a profit motive at all, that path leads back to where we are right now! It needs to be viewed as a health issue that is able to fund its own reduction, recovery and care and bring about a real decrease in its current and future user base and THAT is the REAL financial gain society will receive as a whole across many sectors. Just think of the savings you and I will benefit from..... Reduced policing and incarceration costs, reduced insurance premiums, reduced healthcare costs, and it goes on and on and on once you start digging into it! The trickle down financial benefits across ALL of society are STAGGERING once we change our drug policy and actually start to ADDRESS the cause at the cause by helping and educating the user and potential users instead of our current reactive policy to trying to stamp out the drugs and only ever creating larger financial incentive for criminal enterprises to exist and service a guaranteed demand because of the government policy in place! 

Yes, by all means spend some of the drug tax $ on other sectors..... but for this to really work for society, we have to ensure that it also gets invested back into support services, harm minimisation and education so that in time drug use NATURALLY decreases AND ,the price\purity of drugs beat out illegal sources by a long way so as to destroy the financial incentive for criminal enterprises to exist in the sector. 

The aim should always be maintained on the only outcome that really matters - The organic reduction of existing drug users and reduction of potential drug users! 

We know this happens when drugs are made legal AND services are put in place to help and educate! 

I REALLY wish people, parents in particular, took the time to really understand this issue and bring about fundamental change at a political level! What we are CURRENTLY doing is creating the very problem that EVERYONE is scared of existing! And it costs society untold billions of tax $ each year dealing with it in its current form, only to see the problem get exponentially worse year on year! 

As counter intuitive as it may seem, if someone is really anti drugs..... they should be PRO drug legalisation AND ensure money from legalising drugs is spent back on drug user support services and REAL informative education of potential users! It is the only sure pathway to a REDUCTION of drug use, deaths, social costs and so on!  

Will it lead to ALL drug use stopping..... Of course not! But it will result in a real decrease in existing users, new users and a astounding reduction in the financial costs the current system has tax payers shouldering the burden of! 

I'm not pro or anti drugs..... but I am anti STUPIDITY! 1 thing we can all clearly see is that after a 40yr ""drug war"" the ONLY thing we have gained from it is a WORSE drug problem AND an exponentially increasing financial burden on society as we continue pursuing a failed policy that only ever ensures there is more incentive to supply illegal drugs! 

It is the height of stupidity!  

Enough is enough, we need to fundamentally CHANGE the way this issue is approched!"

As you can see, I started my stonk journey in February, and pretty much bought whatever looked good, at the time. First, I threw $10,000+ at GME on FEB 1 thinking, ""This can only go up! I'm gonna be sooo fuckin rich!!!"". It did not. Also bought a shit ton of AMC, thinking that ""if GME won't work, AMC will just pull a January GME, and send me to the moon. It did not. After that, I just bought whatever was up that day, thinking they would boost my amazing GME gains. Again, they did not. Last week I added ASO and VIAC to the dream team, hoping they would boost my portfolio, because they looked good. As you can see, they haven't helped much, as GME has been steadily tearing me apart since February. Oh, and I bought M, thanking that ""if retail is going up, it only makes sense that the biggest retail store in the world would moon, surprising even WSB, who wouldn't even see it coming. I was gonna be Macy's version of DFV. And, it has been going up most of the time, but it's not really helping me here, and has not mooned the way I thought it would.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[My second portfolio was meant to be a \\""side-portfolio\\"". Something that would make me some money, on the side. For some reason, my good buddy, KO has never failed me, but that's not much help, especially considering that I'm on the GME train, which has brought me nothing but pain, and regret. Lets see what happens next!](https://preview.redd.it/cnspm83nors61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ef1176e19c7b18bdeff52180e7cf8a10481fcc)"
2021-04-13 01:09:10,wallstreetbets,"What, dudes down 20%"
2021-04-13 15:16:20,wallstreetbets,For real I’ve lost like 1500 in value in like 10 minutes. This guy is not built for the stock market
2021-04-13 07:53:39,wallstreetbets,"im actually blind nvm lol,  can still come out on top in a year or 2 though"
2021-04-13 01:09:54,wallstreetbets,GME isnt over bro.  Remember when it dropped from 450-40 and then rocketed to 350.  It hurts now but be patient.
2021-04-12 20:37:45,wallstreetbets,"I still am, but I can't hold out much longer. I've been hearing ""it's gonna moon any day, now"" since February, when I bought in at $225. At this point, I don't think we can take on a huge hedgefund with full industry, media, and govt. support. At this rate, I'll lose everything in both accounts, watching them push GME down every day. I might as well get out, start buying stocks that go up in short bursts, and get out with some profits, rather than hoping for a huge windfall that may or may not happen. That's what happened when people bought RKT in March, and they made money. With my luck, GME would probably go to $1,000, the day after I sell, but I'm just not into it anymore."
2021-04-12 23:05:36,wallstreetbets,"You should read more dd. We’re currently in the end game, but if there’s one thing that’s guaranteed, it’s that rich people reeeeeeally don’t want to give up their money. They’re fighting it every step of the way. It might pop tomorrow and it might pop in 8 months, and when it does, anything below 1000 is going to seem cheap. It might trade below 20 until then. 

Right now their strategy is route all buy orders through dark pools that they can enforce strict control of the price with, and all sell orders through public markets to drive the price down. Thing is nobody is selling, buy orders are outpacing sell orders by a massive margin. 

There’s *a lot* of DD out there. If you read it and think “this is incorrect,” and you no longer believe in the possibility of a squeeze and you don’t believe the company can be a success story, that’s a great reason to cut losses and move on. But doing it because you’re scared, you stand to lose a lot of money for no reason. 

Obviously make your own decisions, but like... just consider them carefully first, and do your best to make decisions based on evidence and expectations, and not fear."
2021-04-12 23:31:51,wallstreetbets,"Then exit your position. Take your loss, and get back out there champ. You can do it."
2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,i did something retarded

2021-04-12 22:24:33,wallstreetbets,The only question I’m asking is... the tell all... how much money did this guy make? That will determine how silly this may or may not be
2021-04-12 22:40:36,wallstreetbets,The mask on it definitely was a poor decision.
2021-04-12 23:08:36,wallstreetbets,Retarded or legendary? It's a fine line.

2021-04-12 20:02:32,wallstreetbets,You'll be telling your children's children about the day a mall video game store stock was shorted- that's when people bet against the company- a lot and you thought they were worth more so you bought some stock and it became worth a lot.

Masks are primarily beneficial for preventing you from *spreading* covid if you have it to other people. They do protect you from airborne viruses, but thats the not best way to protect yourself. The point of masks is to stop spread."
2021-04-12 20:54:42,wallstreetbets,Can treat it like a six toe.
2021-04-12 21:45:54,wallstreetbets,"You’re absolutely right, they *tell* you the point is to stop the spread, but how is it spreading? Through the air, which brings me back to Faucis *actual* belief on masks; That all they do is make people feel better"

2021-04-13 12:54:02,wallstreetbets,"Censoring the f-word, very 4chanesque indeed. You're all very edgy, we're very impressed."
2021-04-12 22:11:02,wallstreetbets,"Fauci was not confident in masks in the beginning because there wasnt enough evidence at the time to demonstrate their effectiveness and he thought that those benefits would not outweigh the fact that people will touch their face more often. Also, after seeing people hoard toilet paper, he didnt want the same to happen to masks while hospitals were struggling to provide ppe.

Then when new data arrived that proved mask effectiveness, he changed his mind because thats what good scientists do. He wasnt stubborn and listened to science.

But sure, keep thinking you know more about public health than millions of public health professionals and doctors worldwide who state the benefits of wearing masks.

Also, lol, its sad and funny you think he was “ordered” to change his mind. By who? cheeto in command whose base hates masks? big mask companies? qanon? you are the perfect example of the dunning kruger effect. i hope you become smarter"

2021-04-13 15:01:25,wallstreetbets,And California alone is a bigger market than all of Canada...?
2021-04-13 14:53:22,wallstreetbets,"The ones about to lose massive portions of their market share to other US companies and LPs? 


Cringe."
2021-04-13 14:59:09,wallstreetbets,"I mean, at least they are wholesale focused. However they paid millions and millions to be in the markets they currently operate in. 

One day soon it will only cost LPs like Aphria the cost of shipping to enter those same markets. Their Candian and Europe markets are just solid additions to the much bigger picture once the US is opened. Europe and the US are expected to be the biggest market. TilAphria already has the largest EU footprint , which is expected to be **bigger** than the US by 2025, according to Curaleaf and some analysts. Adding the US sales to established EU and CA sales is going to be massive. They will have access to the massive US market for the cost of shipping. 


At least Cresco is also wholesale focused (Like LPs) and are ready to tackle a large national market. Other MSOs who are retail focused are going to find out that even a store count of 70 is going to look miniscule to the thousands of new stores opening across the nation."
2021-04-13 07:37:50,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate a bit on the selling CC part?

Some people are perfectly happy paying a few extra bucks for the feeling of safety, same as they do with organic foods and such. I'm not saying these stocks are gonna hit 100+ but I think 30-40 should be pretty fair value for the bigger players"

2021-04-13 07:52:13,wallstreetbets,"If you have >100 shares (RIP premarket) then you can sell a covered call for every 100 shares.

I can't see it not going through, but still, you should check your facts before presenting them as such."
2021-04-13 14:52:02,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Also drinks, like Sweetwater, are expected to be massive. 

Is the BM gonna start brewing and selling to bars as well? 

Soon it won't be any different than some weirdo trying to sell you shoes in the parking lot. Why buy something from a stranger when you could buy it from a trusted source? You wouldn't. 

Also, who cares about 5-15 strains when a store has hundreds? Also, there's no real reason to believe that your local guy has that ""zaza"" like they say.

 Lol if you have a close buddy who grows, that's one thing, but people aren't going to buy drugs from strangers if they have another choice. I also doubt your buddy will also have oil, topicals, pre rolls, drinks, dabs, chocolate..etc. you get my point."

2021-04-13 15:21:36,wallstreetbets,">A company encouraging shareholders to vote on upcoming action is perfectly routine.

Just because it is routine, doesn't make my counter point any less valid. The votes haven't been tallied yet and the decision to merge hasn't been finalized as far as all the shareholders know. You should probably smoke some weed and chill out instead of trying to show you aren't smooth brained (because it is not working)."
2021-04-12 20:34:06,wallstreetbets,"I'm not trying to say that there won't be successful pot companies, just that they're currently being priced as if either the wholesale price of weed isn't going to drop significantly, which it will, or the market for pot will greatly expand, which it won't."
2021-04-13 15:23:29,wallstreetbets,"It does. You act like them asking shareholders to vote means they are worried about the votes, then admit it's routine. 

You're brain is smoother than a slip and slide bro."
2021-04-13 14:43:40,wallstreetbets,"The lowest I've seen biomass in an oversaturated legal state market was ~.07/g for trim, and ~.20/g for bud. 

Even at ~.07, it seems there would be much more money per lb for cannabis versus tobacco. $2lb vs $22lb. So there's plenty of room for that price to fall much lower, if the market was open and legal for everyone. Making derivative margins even sexier, like Aphria's Sweetwater, but anyway..

There's also no reason for large farmers to ever care about quality. They can easily pull in multiple harvests in one growing season using auto flowers, and treating them like any other industrial crop, minus the pesticides. Although with biomass, the pesticides don't really matter, mostly. It's easy to remediate material and remove any pesticides when converting to a concentrate, which is what biomass is used for anyway."

Too bad nobody pulled their head out of their ass 5 months ago and saw this obvious bit of logic coming. 😂 

It's a bit like when Obama got elected on a platform of change, only to realize that the same system of politics that put him into power wasn't interested in destroying itself just yet."

2021-04-12 20:37:08,wallstreetbets,You have no idea what you're on about 😂
2021-04-12 20:46:12,wallstreetbets,It's how all options contracts work you moron. No legitimate broker-dealer is going to sell you ANY derivatives if he isn't sure you can pony up. So you need X amount of cash on hand or sufficient margin to cover the maximum downside your trade can yield.
2021-04-13 14:08:00,wallstreetbets,"It really is.

If I had a dollar for every time I was wrong I would be able to buy more Tesla, even now."

2021-04-12 21:07:42,wallstreetbets,"The absolute shit are you on bro? 

ACH transfer means Automated Clearing House. 

If you initiate an ACH transfer and you ***INSTANTLY*** have buying power in your Robinhood that is 100%, full-stop, no questions asked a margin account.

I have a cash and margin account with Webull and in my cash account I often have to wait >1 week to make a trade after I make a deposit because ACH transfers take time and I don't have margin in a cash account. 

If everyone's telling you you're wrong, and your reaction is to point out everybody and tell them they are wrong, you need to go take a look in the mirror."
2021-04-12 22:48:08,wallstreetbets,"On RH, you get to take on a loan for riskier plays... and use ""instant deposits"". That's about it."
2021-04-12 21:17:33,wallstreetbets,"Chill. I'm listening.

So can we agree instant deposits are equivalent to margin accounts? 

Can we agree if money borrowed with interest is a margin account?

I would have literally gone all in puts if I knew the stock existed @150. 

It's a consulting company valued as tech.

Their margins are in alignment, but their growth isn't their. The platform is going to get dominated by PLTR.

I can try to find my valuations of both of them. They were from last earnings though, so if another 10q came out, my data isn't worth it.

Edit: I shouldn't say that the stock will go to any price, but my valuation model said so and thats largely based on a ton of assumptions, which I then traded on, made around 20% on shorts and I dunno what the final percentage was. Theta was starting to get high so I closed.

I usually long/short companies in same sector. My long was pltr which I was entering via csp.

2021-04-12 22:04:47,wallstreetbets,"Nice update. I'm following this industry closely as well (not that many of us), although I'm focused on dry bulk and the Baltic dry index. Seems Capesize could jump to 100'K before the end of this year. Now, as you pointed out though, dry and tank is extremely cyclical, and way more so than container.

Bought some BDRY and GOGL a while back, but might need to dip my toes in the container-waters if this keeps up.

Also looking at the various companies which ones have ships coming off charters so they can re lease them out acts as a supply constraint"

2021-04-13 13:58:13,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps? 

Those are 1-year shipping quotes though (and 2-3 year rates are now very similar), so if the rates did go down, that doesn't matter much for the firms who have already done a great job of rolling their fleet over.

This isn't a spot reading like tankers or bulkers."
2021-04-13 13:57:25,wallstreetbets,"Not a fan of that business. Very government subsidized, loss-making in many cases. Getting better with recent mergers in Japan, Korea, and China, but there also aren't many liquid stocks to invest into.

2021-04-13 00:13:38,wallstreetbets,Clearly the problem is you didn’t buy silver
2021-04-13 00:15:33,wallstreetbets,"Damn, this is really shitty performance.

I'm going to save this because it actually makes me feel good about my positions, which are down, but they're down in the sense that I am holding AMC & GME"
2021-04-13 00:17:31,wallstreetbets,FUCK .  Is that a new stock? I think It only goes lower .  Available on Robinhood or OTC ?
2021-04-13 00:18:18,wallstreetbets,Tech will be up. It’s obviously the future. Don’t fuck around with day trading.

2021-04-13 01:56:48,wallstreetbets,"It's all I've seen for the last 2 months or so. I just stopped looking, bought dips upon dips, will probably keep doing so. 

It's also just a lot of genuinely good companies going red while besting the shit out of their earnings. So i feel like while this sucks now, in 6 months or so I'll probably be glad it happened."
2021-04-13 02:06:27,wallstreetbets,Every time I seen BNGO I always think bingo and wonder who would invest in that company that makes bingo cards
2021-04-13 02:07:58,wallstreetbets,Reminder stocks do go down bruh
2021-04-13 02:11:34,wallstreetbets,I mean at least it's shares and not options. Bags are at least worth something at the end of the day.

In other words , sir this is most definitely a casino for you ; and the house is giving you the red butt plug right meow"
2021-04-13 06:38:03,wallstreetbets,"Don't BLNK NIO or the IDEX will crash and next thing you know, BNGO! You've got the worlds shittiest SPWR.

2021-04-13 07:56:21,wallstreetbets,OUCH!!!!!
2021-04-13 08:19:19,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for making me feel better about my losses in the last two months.  Sucks donkey balls watching one of my tickers drop 10 days in a row, most around 10%.  Even when it's green almost 10% premarket, it somehow ends the day closer to -10%.  Realized going in it was volatile, but 10 days in a row??  FUCK ME.  It's times like this you really got to remind yourself why you got into it in the first place and stick with it, average down, sell some CSP.  Sometimes doing nothing is also a strategy, but fuck is it ever hard to do.  Telling people to remove emotions from the equation is easy, but having the discipline to practice it yourself is much easier said than done."

2021-04-12 22:00:51,wallstreetbets,"I generally want to see what would happen if the trading app you use reversed every trade you made without realizing it.

2021-04-13 13:21:45,wallstreetbets,"All true and my portfolio is scattered liberally with red paint ( as per usual recently ) but I try to keep in mind a comment from Peter Lynch...the only way to lose money in the stock market is to sell shares for less than you paid for them. I've got so used to logging on and seeing the red numbers that I expect it. 

We'll be OK. Hold on. Don't panic. Maybe leave it alone for a few days. I used to sportsbet heavily....learned a lot about handling downside. 

Lesson? When in doubt do nothing!"
2021-04-12 22:09:16,wallstreetbets,It seems like the huge funds taking turns one buys then they all do then first sell n buy next funds stock n second fund sell n just keep repeating churning money to all of them n all lower investors take the hit

2021-04-12 22:11:07,wallstreetbets,10% ???? I'm still in gme at 350 something after averaged down from 380 in Jan still holding bags like airport handler
2021-04-12 22:33:33,wallstreetbets,Fr all I see is robinhood alerts n fidelity alerts ( got out rhood after January dickery but use it to track tickers n options chains cause it's a decent app until Fidelity upgrade.) They where mostly catering to boomers retirement accounts until recently when hundreds thousands moved to them n others from robinhood.  Now with 200k+ accounts opened by younger people like myself I see them offering a different version of app for anyone born after 1940s n want a better app but like the brokerage

2021-04-12 22:14:19,wallstreetbets,"Making a small bet and tracking it for fun is fine.  I had some.  But I cant believe the people who have bet everything, 401k, all of it on GME.  100k or more.  And most have no price target or exit strategy.   So could end up fine, or quite possibly end up a life changing loss.  Individual stocks do not always recover, contrary to thread belief.  I was around, and I can name a dozen tech stocks that went parabolic during the tech boom and now aren’t around.  I really hope it works out."
2021-04-12 22:19:21,wallstreetbets,"when there is small volume and the price goes down 20%, margin calls come in.  Call Options become worthless.  It can happen on the upside, but downside too.  Remember, even after the big jump this stock went back down to $40.  And there werent a lot of buyers at 40."
2021-04-12 23:24:30,wallstreetbets,"I can’t wait for the GME stuff to end. I locked in most of my gains and have 20 shares left that I’m letting sit as a lottery ticket, but I don’t care. I just want to read something other than GME.

We’re all retards here but the parent comment to this thread is the real deal. Some of these people are going to be Qanon level nutjobs if GME just fizzles."

2021-04-12 21:58:11,wallstreetbets,"I am in the middle of swallowing a $450 on APHA. I stupidly should have sold, instead sold covered calls and it has since then dropped even further. now I am out 450, wiping out my entire profit from today and I am still debating if I should sell. I remember strongly considering selling when I was only down 130. But I didn't"
2021-04-12 23:33:00,wallstreetbets,"Seriously bro. Its so played out at this point and the shit people post and believe about it in this sub is behind absurd. Its hilarious to me that this whole sub literally thinks they are at war with hedge funds and everyone that says anything bad about the stock is some sort of operative working for Melvin. They are still talking about short squeezes and gamma squeezes like all of WSB is going to be able to sell for $10,000 a share somwhow. They don't realize nobody in the investment world actually gives any fucks about it except for them and they are just selling shares to dumber and dumber bag holders at higher prices. I wish the mods would at this point at least keep all the GME talk contained to the daily megathread. Why is there even a megathread if every post in the sub is about GME? Its beyond retarded in all aspects at this point."
2021-04-12 22:23:35,wallstreetbets,Wat company u trade with I did use robinhood till January then transfer to fidelity n they say open for options when u open account then u need to apply to trade options there. You know a legit  brokerage that let's u trade off start but decent enough that if u get assigned itll exercise your puts to cover type company
2021-04-12 23:20:44,wallstreetbets,Good man!
2021-04-13 00:37:45,wallstreetbets,I appreciate you. Please don't stop I need insulation for my cardboard box.
2021-04-12 21:18:32,wallstreetbets,That's the goal
2021-04-12 22:27:07,wallstreetbets,"Here's a good way to think about it... Imagine that instead of being in the trade you're in, that money was currently in your account and you didn't own the shares. Would you use that money today to buy the shares of $APHA at its current price or would you think about some other trades instead? If you wouldn't buy the APHA shares today then you should sell them. It doesn't matter that you bought them for or when (unless of course you're thinking about holding periods for tax purposes but that doesn't sound like a factor here) What's happened in the past is already done. Where you're at now is where you're at, every day you start fresh with a balance and/or shares and try to make sure your money is in the best places for gains.  Each day that you keep holding a beaten down stock you're betting on that stock to be the one that's going to take your current account balance up or down from its current level. 

Sometimes sitting at a loss is fine if you truly feel that your money is parked in the best place you can find to park it for future profits. But if you felt like something like $NVDA or another stock had a better chance of future profits than $APHA does, don't let the fact that you're currently holding it or you've already lost money on it keep you from selling it."
2021-04-12 23:41:08,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, I’m interested in how long this continues. This has already surpassed the attention span that I thought this sub would have, but I guess several million people joined this sub for GME and likely have too big of a financial stake in it to not be obsessed.

I hope it rockets, but I’m not holding my breath."
2021-04-12 22:27:03,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood just watches u crash n burn if u get hit around expire I herd fidelity would automatically exercise your bought puts to cover sold
Eg.
 like the Tesla 30k+ losses everybody took when the puts printed n didnt kno until their puts expired worthless n had to buy 100 shares"
2021-04-12 22:42:38,wallstreetbets,"i get it. but i have at most 2% of my available trading bucks trapped here. so for me, its not money i need. I can keep trading and meeting my goals while sitting on this loss. i think i just hate losing money on any thing I buy (not necessarily optimal money-making strategy). I just checked, I have only ever lost money on 12 out of 80 stocks I have traded since I started 7 weeks ago. 

Apha and GME are the only ones > $100 loss."
2021-04-13 03:13:50,wallstreetbets,"You are right.  Also, realized losses are tax deductible."
2021-04-13 00:03:39,wallstreetbets,"That's exactly what's happening. Too many people balls deep in losses that keep holding on to a fake narrative. Its just going to be a slow bleed out from here. As more people's calls expire worthless, more people's leveraged RH accounts hit margin calls and more people come to their senses after seeing massive losses there won't be anyone left to sell to. Certainly nobody that actually knows what they are doing will be willing to buy. The irony is these idiots are literally handing over their inheritances and future lives to the hedge funds who can stay in their bets much longer than retail can."
2021-04-12 21:16:41,wallstreetbets,But will you

2021-04-13 08:37:30,wallstreetbets,The point is to avoid brokerages that stepped in and prevented the squeeze last time by restricting buying. TDA was one of them unfortunately
2021-04-12 22:22:02,wallstreetbets,"Thanks.  Do they offer ""free"" trading, options, and fractional shares? That's what I'm looking for.  Right now I'm using webull for my play money and fidelity for the others.  I'm not entirely satisfied with either."
2021-04-12 20:41:47,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't go balls deep with it because it's volatile.  Realistically $150 could turn into $180 in less than 4 months that's 20% increase in 4 months better than savings but definitely more risky.

Being realistic too, I think it could still drop to $60 before it goes back to $150 then to $300.

My believe is that it will see the $300 in less than 3 months. Will it?  It all depends whether  there's enough whales that want to make money."
2021-04-12 20:28:55,wallstreetbets,"Could you be more specific about how the platform cost you money in trades? I know they haulted trading during the initial squeeze, but they were quicker to get trading back up. It sounds like most of your problems are with the customer service. I haven't had any issues with webull personally, but I'm admittedly very green when it comes to trading and welcome any opportunity to learn something from a more experienced ape."
2021-04-12 22:41:26,wallstreetbets,"WeBull did the same and pulled the plug on GME. TD offers free trading, options but not sure about fractional shares"
2021-04-12 20:46:30,wallstreetbets,"Fair assessment. Thanks for sharing!  I'm still new as hell to this and am just after one or two stocks to start with, then diversify in other stuff. What resources were most helpful to you in learning to trade well? Tooling seems to be really important to stay up on the market."
2021-04-13 00:05:31,wallstreetbets,"Basically their trade ticket wasn't working at all, so I couldn't close a position when I needed to.  Nothing at all related to GME actually, just an unreliable platform from a fake brokerage.  Their ""support"" was worse than useless, so by the time it randomly started working again, the opportunity was gone and with it my money.

Their lack of customer service was/is definitely the most glaring issue though.  This is a company that's asking us to trust them to hold onto a lot of our money and assets, so having knowledgeable and accessible customer service is a basic requirement that they don't even try to meet.

None of that shit is even remotely okay for a brokerage.  Webull is a fake brokerage just like Robinhood.  If for some reason I could only choose between using one of these two, I'd hold my nose and pick Robinhood.  At least they're not backed by Winnie the Pooh."
2021-04-12 23:04:32,wallstreetbets,"Webull communicated the issue in a timely manner. Robinhood lied twice and waited days for a more accurate explanation.

Good to hear about td tho.  Apparently they don't offer it yet, but are being bought by Charles Schwab which does."
2021-04-12 21:42:21,wallstreetbets,"Oof, I haven't made it. I started 1 GME at $330 Jan 29 and have been averaging down, but I also smartly skipped the dip at $40 and currently I'm stuck at $3700 invested with a current value of $2K.

Most things I assume to have knowledge of now is based on comments here, Google searches and past mistakes. For instance one of them says that Monday is best day to buy.

One of my other theories is a climb leading to 4/20. Or that the stock won't come down much more lower than $120 again this year

My favorite is the believe in a more perfect W line. Ignoring the 3/24 dip and adjusting the chart you should see the start of the W on 1/27 the second peak 3/10 and a hopeful peak on say.. between 4/20 through 6/9 at $600+."
2021-04-13 07:34:04,wallstreetbets,"So, what's the catalyst that will cause whatever you're looking to have happen? The other side has survived an enormous rally, congressional inquiries, etc, what will finally make the squeeze happen?"
2021-04-13 07:40:29,wallstreetbets,"They’re also down 50% over the past quarter, which is huge for a hedge fund.

This isn’t an overnight single-switch mouse trap, but a  gradual war of attrition. Who won the Cold War? Was it Reagan or Chernobyl?

When “the other side” finally trips, it’s not about what we did to make them fall, but whether or not anyone could possibly help them back up."

2021-04-13 03:29:17,wallstreetbets,"I don't know what you meant, it looks like an X in a box after you said term. Or perhaps you mean the word retard? I understand what you mean, and you are a good bloke, however I refuse to be afraid of using a word in good fun. In a setting where it seems to be used quite often.

If you wish to hear why I genuinely feel this way. Please do read on. 

You think perhaps I should say moron instead? Well that as well used to be a medical term to classify people with low intelligence, idiot... I don't think that one was medical but it is another word to describe a mentally lacking person.  Mental acuity is determined largely by genetics you see, so in a way idiot just as well as moron is just as hateful as retard. We can all work hard and study but every one of us has a mental cap. So making fun of even a dumb dumb (someone who isn't that stupid but more often than not makes stupid decisions) is making fun of a person who can't help be a dumb dumb. Just as much as I can't help being white or male or a mentally handicapped person can't help being mentally handicapped. You prefer perhaps I say ape? Being used just the same as people would have used the word retard in the past. Isn't that just replacing the word with another but still having overall the same meaning? Therefore, I will use whatever colorful language I desire, for the sake of being funny and maybe giving some of my fellows on the only subreddit I really use daily a light chuckle. 

I will express though that when I see a mentally disabled person I wouldn't ever call them a retard and to be honest I don't even think of them as a retard. To me, retard is a word with origins, of course, but now really just means a really big poo brain. 

If you don't like me for that it is your right, just as, for at least today, at least this moment, it is my right to say what I want. Don't worry, in the future when what words we are allowed to use and aren't is much more heavily enforced, you will have a sweet little giggle knowing I'm a grumpy boy about it. Probably in a prison somewhere with my mouth locked closed with other major criminals... Press that asked too many questions, guys who whistled at a woman, and anyone who didn't take their mandatory mood stabilizers after being warned by their home terminal three times in a row."

2021-04-12 23:24:49,wallstreetbets,"Contracts are useful if you have a plan. They are not as good as they seem on here, like penny stocks, where you get them cheap and then make 10,000 fold return. Can it happen... sure. But the kind of stock that jumps that high has inherently high volatility so the options will be priced accordingly. Can be good if you got in on the ground floor but usually nothing is going on so it's it's same as if you just bought the stock. If you get behind the 8 ball, the cost effectiveness goes way down. Like the idiots buying 800c on GME. Wasting money because the price it would need to hit to get a decent return was way beyond 800. 

Usually, the best way to make money on options is to spend quite a bit of money on them. I'm hoping for a 500% return on an investment but I put 10k in. So my hope is to come out above 50k. Puts are safer but usually need more capital in reserve to make that money and satisfy margins."

Literally my favorite restaurant is not a chain, and is owned by the couple who works there. And my preferred grocer is literally a private, employee owned company.  I do sometimes shop at a publicly traded grocer as well, but they are not owned by the government as far as I can tell.

 >And other things I don’t feel like going back and explaining something simple for me. 

Wut.

Except I have no clue what you're talking about.  Give me some names of government owned businesses which I would be familiar with, at the least.  So far you've zero evidence for your assertion, and I did your task and it was not in your favor."
2021-04-12 22:56:15,wallstreetbets,By “owned by the government” you mean... paying taxes? Yeah then you’re owned by the government too asshole.

Thanks for explaining your point. I disagree.

You don't have a choice because the government is the controlling power.  Right or wrong, they have a monopoly on legitimate force. Governance isn't ownership.  It's very different.

>Companies have to abide from the government as well; it’s how the government is able to do a lot of things and have minimal repercussions. 

Again, being governed isn't being owned.

>I can’t provide evidence or answer the questions you have because you’re not asking any; you’re telling me things but I’m only guessing on what you want to know/hear.

As I pointed out awhile ago, the only way you come to the conclusion that government owns businesses is by using a very different definition of ownership than most people."
2021-04-12 23:11:09,wallstreetbets,Taxing something isn't ownership of it.

2021-04-12 20:19:52,wallstreetbets,Home building is most likely causing the supply shortage. My neighbor paid about the same for his roof that I did ten years ago. The crew that installed it was 99% immigrant. Their substandard wage is what keeps a lot of inflation from occurring. If immigrants were all removed magically overnight and all manufacturing were ordered to be done here then you’d see runaway hyperinflation. Goods costing more has more to do with shipping costs right now. Concentrating money into the hands of the wealthy doesn’t create inflation. And people saving the stimulus doesn’t create inflation. People getting paid more causes inflation. Which still isn’t happening.
2021-04-12 20:21:49,wallstreetbets,"Inflation does not trickle down evenly everywhere. I recommend you speak to home depot, circle back after."
2021-04-12 22:31:11,wallstreetbets,"Good points about rich not causing inflation in most places. It does occur in real estate from wealthy Americans and from Europeans and Chinese investing in the US. In China their home prices have gone up incredibly in the past 15 years and same with India. With safety in the US people are inclined to owning in the US. Might be a big disaster waiting to happen and is pricing out regular people. 

It’s crazy to witness home price inflation acting like stocks when they should be acting more like stable bonds."
2021-04-13 05:55:05,wallstreetbets,Whatever the market will bare. Other countries may be bidding up real estate in major metro markets and that could be tipping the overall scales but I have not seen or heard about a Chinese or Russian multinationals purchasing single family homes in the suburbs or middle America. It seems like everyone is obsessed with the near zero rates and want to buy buy buy while it’s still low cause everyone’s convincing themself that rates are going to rise soon. I don’t think rates will rise soon and when they do they will be very slow. A sharp rise would absolutely sink the markets.

2021-04-12 20:25:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I could say the same thing about AWS or Azure and it would be true. They often release new features that aren't quite thought out, have inadequate documentation, sample code, or integration with their other database offerings or design patterns. But alas, we live in an imperfect world. I think they will rapidly meet demand as they have with everything else.

*edit, spelling"
2021-04-12 20:33:02,wallstreetbets,"And sorry, you asked me about their 'push to Splunk Cloud sub models and away from enterprise': 

Ofc this is just my personal opinion, but I believe Splunk learned the hard way that having people run their own on-prem shit is actually kind of complicated. Depending on the setup of their environment, load balancers, specific heavy forwarding needs-- and generally, how your company runs on Splunk-- are all kinda based on people configuring and managing something correctly that they don't know about and aren't really incentivized to learn much about. All that leads to performance problems for end users which reflects poorly on Splunk. I forget if Splunk had any notion of burst pricing, but they could definitely do something like that someday and really drive down costs for users with Splunk cloud as well (not sure why they would do it though unless it really was a reason for losing business)."
2021-04-12 20:51:31,wallstreetbets,"Yep! 
Totally agree, and once a firm installs splunk, it is very difficult to remove it, but migration is very possible to cloud. I think its vendor partnerships and vendor created addons in its ""marketplace"" are also a big step I havent seen with other seims (maybe elasticsearch)

What i do see, is that most major corps pay splunk contractors, they dont keep staff on hand, but contracts will go on for years and years (lots of gov using splunk and contractors too)

Id say, although in my personal opinion (that of a splunk contractor) its looking like i might need to find another seim. But what seems clear is that this is something corps want to outsource. Splunk Cloud could be the right answer if it doesnt flop. 

On the flip side, I think splunk will have no choice but to continue Splunk Enterprise licensing for the forseeable future, because DoD and corps use it for data they have all kinds of requirements for, and couldnt just hand it off to splunk. Like, not even allowed in aws govcloud data. 

Cheers!"

2021-04-13 04:36:41,wallstreetbets,"Well, it depends on what you mean by scale. If you have hot indexes going beyond 250TB, sure, you're gonna have a bad time. If you architect it appropriately you can achieve pretty good scale for most needs....but yeah, it doesn't scale in to the PB world very well - though I'd argue there's rarely good reason for ES to be in the PB scale, at that size you need to be looking at a hybrid approach where ES is just one part of a wider architecture. At large scale, a one-tool solution never works perfectly, imo.


And in the context of this thread - try going with Splunk for PB scale on AWS and then you'll see what expensive hot garbage really looks like ;)"

2021-04-13 12:31:51,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure they could turn it around, but they'd have to reduce their prices, and I don't see that happening. IMO they are only surviving because of their existing captive customer base, and not because of real net new growth. But hey I could be wrong.

I think the attractive thing about the monolithic approach is that people hate learning multiple different tools and want 1 tool to rule them all. Kinda like how you see ridiculously obese SQL and they think the issue is 'the RDBMS doesn't scale' when really they are doing something pretty stupid. 

When I see 50PB of cold logs in Splunk I just want to ask ""why?"".....they could be offloading archival somewhere much cheaper, more portable, and more usable. But hey, people doing dumb things keeps food on our table so we can't complain eh"
2021-04-12 22:54:38,wallstreetbets,"Agree with everything in this post, but the better options play in uranium is the ETFs, which will move in parallel with CCJ and the others, with more upside potential due to more exposure to smaller caps which will grow more. I did a rough calculation and my estimate is that at the peak of this rally, $URNM will be 5x from current levels, and $URA a little less than that due to it not being a pureplay on U miners. $CCJ will probably go 5x also but I’d rather not be concentrated in just one miner, I’d rather play the whole sector which has a strong underlying fundamental story to it.

To my family, because GameStop is a physical retail store that sells sdisc copies, in a world that is going digital. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is; If theres one thing we can all learn from this is, if you do your “Do Diligence” and Research of the stock, and your sold on your intuitions. Never doubt yourself, never let anyone make it emotional, believe in YOU!! You are all you have Ape!! Diamond hand🚀💎💎💎💎🦍"

The biggest things they should be looking for is a CEO that understands and can execute Cohens vision. Someone who can spot talent and cultivate it, who can get all branches of the company to buy in to the new vision and dumps anyone who can't.

Most of the suggestions I've seen are for people who were CEOs of big companies and have big names. Fuck that shit, they might as well have kept Sherman. Whoever they pick needs to have passion to make gamestop greater than it is."

No matter what happens, you won! You saw the potential for the long play and seized the opportunity, you saw what the vast majority of others did not. There are going to be some winners out of all of this, and sadly some losers, that is unfortunately the nature of our society. 

But you, you glorious ~~goon~~ ape made it! Buy the most ridiculously annoying color lambo imaginable, put vinyl decals on it with your triumphant win, diamond hands and all with moon graphics (don't forget the cats, how could I have forgotten to mention that?). Do burn outs in front of Wallstreet or Melvin capital or whomever you personally feel you outsmarted in their overzealous greed to run a company into the ground. Then buy a pile of switch consoles, show up to a children's hospital and offer them rides in a ridiculous outfit cruisin' down the street in the lambo. Shower them with switches and games, and prove that you are the best type of person. Make it such a spectacle with a portion of your winnings that no one with a moral fiber will ever question dragging you into court. Be who everyone knows you are, a generous and kind person.

u/Cashflow_ I’m not apologizing for “not” selling you pictures of my feet and then telling you I won’t sell you pics. I’m not accepting your apology because that’s lame and for the record I was never mad or annoyed. Didn’t give a fuk. You however should get some ibuprofen or something because you’ve been a smidge sensitive this week - we get it though because your eye looks like hell.

u/Darkbyte I’m not apologizing for not being a cat person and only making an exception for u/four1six_ ‘s blep cat. I even made him an emoji for his cat back in my Janet Yellen days when you barely pinged me and I’m not changing my feelings. 💅

Also you didn’t think to look up black mage feet. *No one did*. You didn’t think they existed. It takes a special kind of fucked up mental space to assume they could exist and then look for them. we all know it. Your Google search reveals have 0 effect on me.

2021-04-13 03:11:41,wallstreetbets,"Getting vaccinated is pretty magical, it’s the most hopeful thing I’ve experienced in over a year. I got my first shot yesterday. The weather here (in New England, good memory) has been a little bipolar. One day is perfect and warm and sunshiney, and then the next day is 40 degrees. It’s alright. Of the places I’ve lived, New England is my least favorite so far. It’s the most expensive for the least desirable area.

I’m considering moving back to the west coast, a friend of mine wants to open a bar and he wants me to help him run it, and it honestly sounds like a dream.

What are you excited to do once vaccinated?"

2021-04-12 21:37:18,wallstreetbets,That’s because alibaba **can’t** fight this fine. There is no appeal process.
2021-04-12 22:14:12,wallstreetbets,There's an high court and an appeal process too. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti_Monopoly_Law_of_China
2021-04-13 02:16:53,wallstreetbets,You think the appeals process is gonna overrule something xi jinping likely ordered? China’s appeals process isn’t a real appeal process by US standards
2021-04-13 02:22:06,wallstreetbets,"Yes indeed. Easier to think that's there's one person that decide and order the appeal process for everyone and everything because he has the power to view hundreds of millions of outstanding processes and decide in real time what to do for each or them.

But definitely is true, I've read that on the internet make sense! 


Also appeal process in the US is not a real appeal process by any means as testified by the numerous number of people that went in jail without having done anything just because they happen to have a different skin color."
2021-04-12 21:18:59,wallstreetbets,“Alibaba has 2x the revenue of Amazon.” That’s wrong. Alibaba’s revenue is around ~$72B whereas Amazon’s is ~$350B. Amazon’s revenue is almost 5x Alibaba.

2021-04-12 21:57:14,wallstreetbets,"This assumption has been wrong and there is little reason to think your assumption will be the right for a good few years. The credits are due to increasing efficiency requirements, which if you actually think about it, will continue to increase until car companies are probably between 90%-100% EV. So likely minimally 15 years before we see these credits go away and probably about 5 years before there is any meaningful decline in the credit revenue. In any case, if Tesla is not already profitable without the credits, I believe by the time the new factories are opened this year they should become clearly profitable (i.e. due to costs of producing and delivering the cars going down... the 4680 cells and single casts should also mean improved cars as well, so demand should continue to exceed supply for a long-time)."
2021-04-13 04:07:59,wallstreetbets,"> Aren't citadel in hot water and long on tesla?

Citadel is the biggest TSLA options market maker - they have tens of millions of TSLA shares of delta hedging inventory alone. There are over 950,000 deep in the money call contracts from last year's TSLA rally - I'd guess Citadel has written around 300,000 of those, maybe more.

I don't think Citadel has a directional bet on TSLA - nor would it be wise with such a huge TSLA inventory. I'm sure they are using their TSLA weight to pin the price around key expiry dates though.

I.e. Citadel is delta neutral and doesn't really care about whether TSLA rises or falls.

OP's short thesis is based on a fundamental & embarrassing misconceptions about Tesla's current state & business prospects, and shows clear contempt for rational, critical analysis."

2021-04-13 04:54:41,wallstreetbets,">  From what I understand, people believe the reason TSLA is priced what it is, is for their auto pilot software, which they are pursuing in a completely different way than other major manufacturers, and their energy/battery potential. Personally, I have zero stake in Tesla, but I am a little biased because I love papa Musk (for SpaceX more than anything).

Look I'm a Tesla fan and like Elon for the crazy dude he is. But I don't like the Tesla valuation. 10% people believe TSLA for auto pilot, 10% are in it for the electric cars, 10% are in it for uhh battery technology. The other 70% are following the first 30%. It's social dominoes."
2021-04-12 23:23:40,wallstreetbets,"Outproducing Tesla is irrelevant as you will need to meet overall efficiency requirements so the ICE vehicles will still come with a penalty. As efficiency requirements go up, it will require an ever-accelerating pace of conversion to EV to avoid having to buy credits. It is really a math problem. From a legislative standpoint, if you want to promote EV adoption you need to continue to increase efficiency requirements which means the credits are not going down anytime soon. You can model this on a spreadsheet easy enough, and depending on exactly what efficiency requirements are pushed the credit market can easily increase. Only companies that are full (or almost fully) electric will have extra credits to sell. VW will not have credits to sell as it would be counter-productive to allow a company that makes 25% of their vehicles EV off the hook, when the goal is to promote 100% EV adoption."

2021-04-13 00:24:09,wallstreetbets,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/financials/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/financials/)

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/financials/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/financials/)

You want to compare Apple to Tesla, let's do it.  Apple had $274B in revenue last year with at 38.2% gross margin.  Tesla had $31.5B revenue last year with a 21% gross margin.

Despite Apple doing 8.7X Tesla's revenue, in an industry with much better profit margins, Tesla's market cap is about 30% of Apple's.  This is on a gross margin basis, if you look at net income, Tesla still doesn't earn a profit through operations.  They squeak out a profit due to subsidies from the US government.

This is all while having a virtual monopoly of the EV space.  Meanwhile, every major auto manufacturer in the world is now investing heavily into EV and will have a competitive product or product line available within the next 5 years.

I agree that the Tesla brand is valuable, but giving it a 20X+ price-sales ratio as an auto manufacturer is just absurd.  Toyota's price/sales ratio is less than 1.  You can maybe justify it for a small new company, but Tesla is already the most valuable auto company in the world, and it's not even close.

Where do you want the price to go next?  Where is the upside?  If Tesla doubles again it becomes a $1.3T market cap company with under $50B in annual sales.  Facebook is under $0.9T market cap with $86B annual revenue and an 80% gross margin.  You'd have to be clinically insane to think Tesla is a more valuable company than Facebook."
2021-04-13 00:52:51,wallstreetbets,"They can only have a surplus if they (can be GM, Ford, Toyota, etc... not just VW ) increase EV production faster then the required ZEV credits increase. In CA for example the ZEV % required for 2021 is 12%, whereas for 2025 it is 22%.

In any case the ZEV credit system is a penalty if you don't meet it, hence it is cheaper to buy excess credits from manufacturers with a surplus.

This really is not that complicated.

As to why governments would push this further... Well maybe some see value in accelerating the move to EV's and see the ZEV system as a great incentive, so they will want to increase the requirements, hence ZEV credits are here to stay for a while."

My example referred to Apple's position when they went out with the iPhone and how the competition didn't prevent Apple from dominating the market since then.   


TSLA is still a growth company with insane year-to-year rates. No one cares for the revenue right now, because it's all going towards investments. If you can't realize what the revenue will look like once all factories are in full production and FSD becomes government-approved, 1.3T market cap is probably on the low side. Government subsidies? Come on man, the car industry and many other sectors would have been bankrupt long ago if it wasn't for taxpayer money-saving their asses.   


Again, if you think TSLA isn't a big deal that made the whole industry change and companies like VW that are the giants of their industry, then you are the one clinically insane as you ignore what is happening before your eyes."

Oh, and enjoy your competition. If you have time, look at Sandy Munro's look at the ID.4 today (the video where he has it up on the lift). If VW is the competition, the competition is years behind and Tesla will be just fine."
2021-04-13 00:46:30,wallstreetbets,"That’s exactly the point, and my initial comment. Earnings are publicly reported, prices for a security are determined on the public market. A high P/E ratio is not always indicative of an overvalued company in hindsight - which is what Amazon is an example of and the perspective we are viewing this from.

Tesla and Amazon are two different businesses, at different times in the market, and at different maturities in their life cycle. My initial comment is solely focused on how “their P/E is over 1000x” is not always a useful metric for assessing the long term value of a business, given its quarter to quarter variability.

The great part about the market is that you can short the stock if you think Tesla does not deserve the price premium it’s commanding."

I did after buying my first couple thousand listen to an earnings call, and it wasn't anything crazy, but the people believed in what they were doing, and not just trying to boost the stock price. 

I thought about their current customers, forklifts, and imagined a forklift plugged in for 30mins to charge as opposed to a hydrogen cell needing only 5 mins to fill. I bought more."

Orders backed up, and shipments to companies basically stopped. Turns out, at the same time everyone started working from home, ushering in a new wave of people on top of gamers looking to buy a gpu. A few months go by, and manufacturing starts up again with a higher demand for GPU's then before, but as they hit the shelves Bitcoin hits an All-time high. So now not only do you have the gamers looking to buy GPU's but you have the WorkForce and Bitcoin miners buying too, on an already stressed supply. The worlds manufacturing was not ready for this increase in demand, therefore the price goes up. Supply and demand, it's simple."
2021-04-13 17:00:54,wallstreetbets,"The point at which I owned 2000 shares of GME was pre-Jan 28. At the time my goal was to make a shitload of money, which I did depending on your opinion of what ""a shitload"" is. Even without the paper losses I showed for the sake of the 'we demand loss porn' crowd (-$483K from the peak), I still acquired enough profits from selling options to zero out all debts, pay for at least a year of living and business expenses, and still have enough to pay the tax man.

Many of those options at the time were exercised / assigned, as I had rolled them extremely deep into the money to secure profits.

Around $40/share I was looking at my 100 ""Fuck You"" shares I planned to take to my grave, my six-figure returns (thus far) that I'd made on GME, and the bleeding price action when I discovered a new strategy, which would leverage options for infinite shares, as long as prices are continually suppressed.

If I was wrong, I'd earn a shitload of money on the squeeze (which I did, again, when the price shot up from $45 to $350), and if I was right, I'd end up literally owning the company outright.

Now I'm in a middle area. The price bleeds, I amass shares at an exponential rate, and I get WAY more shit from WSB-ers for posting Robinhood screenshots than I do from folks who like to dig up old posts (but for some reason can't see where I've already discussed this).

So I've said it before and I'll say it again: I'm not posting anymore Robinhood screenshots. Things will be much more interesting in the weeks/months to come if you just go ahead and assume that the shares in Fidelity are all of my shares."
2021-04-13 17:07:29,wallstreetbets,"If the price stays down, and I can average 5% cumulative increase in shares weekly... about 140 weeks (a little under 3 years).

If I can average even 10% monthly, I'd break 1million shares in about 4 years.

Working to get a head start now; not expecting to keep up 10% weekly, lol (keep bringing that sweet sweet price suppression + high IV, though and maybe!). If somehow the price moved in *just* the right way that I could acquire 10% more cumulative shares on a weekly basis, I'll break 1 million shares by April 2022.

Not complicated. It's just math."

2021-04-13 12:31:28,wallstreetbets,I would say that shares are almost certainly safe at this point but I don't know when it is going up again.  Their outlook and growth are solid enough (though some think over valued) but I wouldn't risk an EOW anymore. That ship has possibly sailed.

2021-04-13 15:49:23,wallstreetbets,Not enough to justify a more than 3000% increase in stock price lol
2021-04-13 16:20:55,wallstreetbets,"I hope your puts print. 

Clearly there have been a lot of people buying at these prices, so what yu justify as a fair price and what someone else justifies it at might not be the same. 

I don't think tesla should be more than $200. But its close to $800. Numbers don't justify the price, market sentiment seems to prevail."
2021-04-13 16:59:49,wallstreetbets,Lol tesla has a high price because it has a future.  Tesla also isn’t up over 3000% from where it was last year lol.  What an idiotic comparison.
2021-04-13 17:04:34,wallstreetbets,"It's just a comparison to demonstrate fundamentals don't really mean much for every scenario. So just like you said ""tesla has a high price cuz it has a future"", the same can be said for ganestop. And yeah a year ago it didn't have the future it has now. So not buying it a year ago, but being comfortable with buying it now while it's 3000% higher can be justified. 

Im really not arguing against you btw, just playing devils advocate to your original comment."

Honestly don't get why you're so upset about this lol. 

And I won't lose, I've already realized a 700% gain on my initial $5k investment into GME. Everything else I'm holding is house money currently. My 💰 bags are secured and in my savings. Thanks for hoping I atleast enjoy it tho? Weird.

I closed out 75 of them... kind of regretting it but hey, profit is profit and letting the other 25 ride.

I also bought 3 4/23 ITM puts at a 148 strike.   This way it still covers by a few hundred bucks on the remaining 25 if we end the week back at 119 or so. 

if we ride to 150 it's still pays 30k or so, after taking out 5k for put costs , and if there's an absolutely meltdown it prints."
