2021-04-13 19:13:23,wallstreetbets,Haha ye went like 40% on it in the 9s in my roth.
2021-04-13 19:32:29,wallstreetbets,"I am not saying that 1700$ is nothing. It can hurt... yes. But still not a YOLO

So... 1700$ not a YOLO?"

It‚Äôs a yolo with low risk."
2021-04-13 19:06:51,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the current Bloomberg Terminal say on institutional ownership?
2021-04-13 19:36:36,wallstreetbets,the real question is why did fidelity keep 87 shares?
2021-04-13 19:59:28,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-13 18:59:50,wallstreetbets,bro bloomberg terminal is only 24k a year so I don‚Äòt think it‚Äòs credible enough
2021-04-13 19:01:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah that numbers fucked. It‚Äôs a shame how difficult it is for retail to get accurate and timely information that isn‚Äôt just the ticket price and fud articles
2021-04-13 19:44:51,wallstreetbets,I feel like this is pretty common knowledge for anyone that regularly keeps up with the DD. Institutional ownership is still greater than 100% tho. It's always good to get opposing views though because echo chambers are dangerous.
2021-04-13 19:01:02,wallstreetbets,"Great work, following"
2021-04-13 19:34:16,wallstreetbets,"This is correct. FINRA is pulling the data from Morningstar and maybe some other sources. It‚Äôs double and triple counting because it‚Äôs counting both dates 12/31 and 3/31 for example (it has to be one or the other) and obviously there‚Äôs that Fidelity entry two times.

Important to note, that‚Äôs not an ‚Äúofficial FINRA‚Äù website it‚Äôs pulling data from Morningstar. For the holdings it‚Äôs feed is obviously fucked up. This is also why it‚Äôs short interest % used to be different than other sources- it was using Morningstar‚Äôs float calculation which is Incorrect.

It does suck that there‚Äôs no accurate site for this data for retail. 

But, NOBODY has accurate holdings data. 13fs are filed 45 days after the end of the quarter. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have Bloomberg (I do), the holdings are still mostly as of 12/31."

2. The blackrocks are different entities in fact one is the subsidiary that owns shares in the corporate parent
3. The Fidelity‚Äôs are corporate entities as well. I believe it is FMR for the parent followed by the research and then the research LLC which runs the foreign LLcs. Yes those companies and their relationships are all listed in their organization holdings and associated docs. I had done a larger explanation on Sunday. This is a quick reclama. Basically. What you see on that corporate GME site is a no shit audited hang my auditor ass out to dry document"
2021-04-13 19:29:11,wallstreetbets,"This will likely get downvoted, but great work.

2021-04-13 19:07:23,wallstreetbets,"If you comment like this, you haven't read the post but only the conclusions. All the claims you made are answered in the post. Just read and UNDERSTAND."
2021-04-13 19:35:16,wallstreetbets,"This isn't a conspiracy. These are just automatically generated summaries from public filings.

In my M&A group, we frequently pull tables like this from FactSet to show similar ownership between companies (e.g. if the same funds own Company A and Company B, they'd probably be inclined to accept a merger with stock as the consideration, since they obviously like both companies already). You have to rub together a couple brain cells to scrub the data and eliminate obvious duplicates, but it's not hard... though these websites or even data services like FactSet and Bloomberg aren't going to devote humans to doing it for every public company in existence."
2021-04-13 19:18:26,wallstreetbets,Do you think this is closer to the real value? I am long on GME but skeptical of the 192% mostly for filing date purposes like you mentioned.
2021-04-13 19:04:13,wallstreetbets,I own GME shares but I don't like misinformation.

2021-04-13 19:18:58,wallstreetbets,I did go through it. Yes. I am not sure about the filings. Yes they are separate entities but I would love to work it back through the financials. Truth in lending I am not sure regarding the filings at all and defer to you on those
2021-04-13 19:12:52,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs about four posts below this. Starts with Ymmv. Kinda long analysis like yours
2021-04-13 19:11:14,wallstreetbets,I just posted a more nuanced opinion which used finra data. But hey we‚Äôre all trying to understand. The second more nuanced opinion shows the corporate governance that allows them to move shares
2021-04-13 19:43:28,wallstreetbets,"I understand that these are automatically generated. I‚Äôm not calling the data summary a conspiracy at all.

The ‚Äúintentional and malicious‚Äù part is how people have been using this bad information to mislead others and/or confirm their own biases. In many of the GME threads, it‚Äôs impossible to point out irregularities in data like this because it goes against the hive mind. 

On the other hand, data that is antithetical to their thesis will be picked apart, flipped upside down and rearranged until it *does* fit their thesis."
2021-04-13 19:57:01,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd say the BT % is the closest us plebs can get to a correct number but even the BT has dated info. There‚Äôs not a doubt in my mind BT>Finra though.
2021-04-13 19:26:00,wallstreetbets,I have 795 deep under water and I agree 100%.
2021-04-13 19:53:41,wallstreetbets,Sorry I didn't mean to be rude. I left the double Blackrock explanation because it's the same as the one for Fidelity so it was subtextual and you can check it yourself.
2021-04-13 19:26:28,wallstreetbets,">I did go through it. Yes. I am not sure about the filings. Yes they are separate entities but I would love to work it back through the financials. Truth in lending I am not sure regarding the filings at all and defer to you on those

Ok I'm glad you read. Then I tell you that if you think they are separate entities just compare the C - I - K (I write it like that because the word is banned) and above all find the Filing of the SEC. I have already checked because at the beginning of the research I had the doubt too. If you find me 13F, G,D with different C - I - K's for each company, I'm ready to change my mind."
2021-04-13 19:45:21,wallstreetbets,"Ah okay, in that case we are in total agreement."
2021-04-13 19:35:21,wallstreetbets,No. I‚Äôll start look at those forbidden words as well. I mean I started looking at the corporate entities and then the questions about threshold reporting. Are they different because a LLC may be foreign vice deleware based. My brain hurts looking at them. You did a great job by the way
2021-04-13 19:46:36,wallstreetbets,"Look if you want to understand right away what I mean in the thread read this comment and response.

&#x200B;

It's ridiculous how the stock hasn't reacted at all to the great news as of late. Cohen as chairman, plus search for a new CEO. No negative news at all, all the DD still stands. Seen all that stuff before, holding has never been easier.

&#x200B;

People used to draw the VW squeeze comparison, but I disagree. If you want to compare squeezes, compare to TSLA. Long, drawn out, and to ridiculous heights. The institutions in short positions are too stubborn and have too much liquidity to get squeezed out in one short blast. The VW squeeze had an element of surprise, which is missing with GME. But when all the fundamentals keep getting better and better and it gets clear the stock isn't going anywhere back to where it was, shorts will get closed. Slowly, with new shorts being opened on the way, but they will. Also way better scenario for the stock in my opinion. Compare 2008 VW chart to 2020-2021 TSLA chart and pick what you would rather own."

2021-04-13 17:29:50,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre going to be the entire volume of a 1 minute candle tomorrow. Welcome to the club!
2021-04-13 17:43:37,wallstreetbets,"Read /u/NrdRage's DD on this one. This is actually my 2nd trip with them, first one resulted in 500% gains.  Easy cash!"
2021-04-13 17:39:02,wallstreetbets,"You mean a price not since seen since......last week?  Yeah, it's totally not going to be able to do that in the next 2+ months. Also, that's the breakeven for the expiration date.  It moves up another 50 cents and I'm green."
2021-04-13 18:33:07,wallstreetbets,lol an ETF
2021-04-13 17:49:12,wallstreetbets,Got it sell
2021-04-13 17:43:12,wallstreetbets,"I didn't comment on the ability to eventually reach that.

The underlying is $11.6x and you have breakeven of 14.63.

2021-04-13 17:51:42,wallstreetbets,"Um, you do realize that when you buy a call, you don't have to hold it to expiry, right?  And you are aware that most people don't, correct?  This one jumped to 11.75 in AH.  If it holds that and adds another...maybe 25 cents to 12 tomorrow, her options have already printed.    


I'm not sure you understand how this works."
2021-04-13 18:18:04,wallstreetbets,I have an odd feeling that you are either holding AMC or GME right now. Perhaps both?
2021-04-13 18:17:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I completely understand how buying OTM options works.   


Its just worth less today than when it was bought, which is an ""ouch"" situation.   


Losing value does hurt doesn't it?  


I have options i+n the red, I know they will print (or think they will) but every dollar ""down"" sucks.   


6/18 13c was $1.10 EOD today (Breakeven 14.10)   


11c was 2.10 Breakeven 13.10.   


TBH, I am not sure you understand how this works or the meaning of ""ouch"" either.   


Which one are you having issues with?   


\-"
2021-04-13 18:26:56,wallstreetbets,"Why TF would you think that?   


I was in and cashed out on both GME dumps and an (much smaller) AMC dump as well.  


Just because someone thinks that a posted play is not a good one or realizes that the EXACT SAME bet can be purchased cheaper RIGHT NOW, THIS VERY SECOND doesn't mean they are an idiot and holding bags of failed businesses.   


Sometimes, people disagree with your bets a and that's part of WSB. Being rude to people you disagree with is not exactly the hallmark of a decent human being.   


Assuming they are an idiot just because they disagree with you is not the mark of an intelligent human being capable of rational thought and appropriate conversation.   


Ouch means ouch and losing money hurts. Buying an option and watching the price go down also hurts (lost value).  


You might wanna step back and realize not everyone with a different opinion is a moron holding bags of GME and other dying retailers.   


Maybe learn to deal with people that you disagree with in a healthy manner? You will have a happier life not being a total shitbag."
2021-04-13 18:41:53,wallstreetbets,"So now your claim is that you always time a market exactly and never spend any time red on a play?

2021-04-13 17:17:57,wallstreetbets,PFE is a boomer stock. It doesn‚Äôt move much. Since your call is deep in the money so should be fine but not much upside.

60% of his portfolio.
Pfizer had chance to lift off at 10.11 with the first info... There is some shit inside cuz they didnt lift like moderna, novavax etc...
Ps.
Even Polish companies started with rumors and awesome lift off for ex. Biomed Lublin, Mabion, Mercator - they made X00% with rumors xD"
2021-04-13 17:19:33,wallstreetbets,Pfizer today is not pfizer of last decade. Whole new product line. 20b - 40b in new sales. Subscription model. Top brand. Loaded. To. The. Tits.
2021-04-13 17:23:49,wallstreetbets,Moderna to 300 EOY on similar sales

2021-04-13 19:47:58,wallstreetbets,"RSI is an indicator alright. However, not to be used how you explain it imo.  Maintaining a reading of over 69 is sexy hot and shows strength in the rally.  Maintaining a reading under 31 is a sign of extreme weakness and any rally should be sold as the expectation is for the downward trend to continue.  If you take a historical look at RSI on a monthly chart or Weekly chart you can see once the RSI gains sexy 69 and keeps it for 2 periods of the chart timeline that is uber bullish.  ASO is a great example. Put ASO WEEKLY chart up on your screen and take a look at the RSI and how the stock has performed for months. I bought GME today based on a shorter time frame. However, the longer time frame charts are all kinda broken."

Second to highlight your nonsense I'm going to ask a question related to your TLDR. This reversal will be because retailers come in and buy more (because retailers have all ready been buying a fuckton for a long time) or will come from hedge funds having to cover (because some how you think a technical indicator signals when hedge funds are going to be forced to cover)?"

2021-04-13 17:01:52,wallstreetbets,I wish *share* YOLOs weren't even allowed. I don't understand the point of them. It's not risky and millions of people do it every day. No one gives a shit you bought $25k of AAPL. We don't need posts of people just buying shares. They're most likely the same shares everyone else has lol. Remove them and only allow share loss/gain posts. Those are the only things people care about. Only allowing share loss/gain posts knocks 2 birds out with 1 stone.

Not advocating pennystocks or anything like that and don't think DD should necessarily be allowed on cap<1B but the spirit of a YOLO is maximum retard at its most spectacular."

Another example of where they would make sense is in biotech companies with binary events.

One solution could be to raise the limit to $50K or $100K (and as the sub grows, this becomes more feasible) -- but we've already just raised it from $10K to $25K, so it may be better to take it slow for now.

That said, if the position is big enough, then no matter which way the stock moves, a sufficiently large share YOLO would qualify for the gain/loss flair."

2021-04-13 17:20:18,wallstreetbets,"With share YOLOs the gain/loss is going to be minimal. Most shares fluctuate like 1-5% each day.

A share recall would not be in Blackrock's interest (probably the main lender of shares) because it would get rid of a source of income for them.

2021-04-13 17:41:47,wallstreetbets,Nah I held my 200X 25 Strikes. I sold most of my 26's at 60-70 cents but then I bought like 10 more on close for 59 cents. I was hoping for a bigger dip when I sold the 26's.
2021-04-13 18:35:44,wallstreetbets,I'm going to exercise 10 calls at 22.82 and I've got 24 more 23.32.
2021-04-13 18:25:15,wallstreetbets,My Harmonic Patterns Algo shows PT of 32.59 and $46 but It rarely hits it's second price target. I'll hold some shares till 46 once I exercise some of these calls and get my shares for $22-23.
2021-04-13 19:57:58,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs probably so he can watch the price easy .

2021-04-13 18:28:41,wallstreetbets,"Your logic is definitely solid. I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt go to $46 soon. My TA suggests it‚Äôll go to $30 and base line around those levels before a run higher is possible. But I wanna believe $46 is possible cause PLTR is moving to $25 today even with all the shorts and the demo day stuff. Earnings could be a a catalyst to go to $46. 

I got in small with $100 on some 4/30 $40C today. It won‚Äôt cover earnings but thinking there‚Äôll be a run up."
2021-04-13 18:35:54,wallstreetbets,"It'll go up slightly tomorrow, a bit more Thursday, and explode Friday imo.

It'll definitely go up when DFV exercises, whoever sold him that contract has to come up with 500,000 shares instantly. Do they have all those shares? Probably not. They'll have to buy at least some at market price to sell to DFV at $16, probably a $200/share loss for them at the peak when he drops the bomb.

I averaged down to $142 and I'm quite pleased, my wifey bought at $140 today."
2021-04-13 18:21:20,wallstreetbets,Being a PLTR Bull is like being in an Abusive Relationship and you keep saying hit me harder daddy! And then after months of Punishment he buys you a BMW!

I do not ever want to hear 'but we used to..' in this room. No you didn't. You didn't used to anything because the company we're building didn't exist before today. You can keep the logo. Maybe.""

This is what companies need that aren't making it through the internet revolution, but they're too scared to do it. AMC could really use this type of attitude in their corner.

2021-04-13 17:18:58,wallstreetbets,"I am expecting it to go back to $230 before Friday. Then it's a mystery. Does it prove capitulation around the target price, or does it retest 300s? I am not inside enough to tell."
2021-04-13 19:21:22,wallstreetbets,"This is bullish AF. If u look at their 10-K this allows them to now issue dividends, sell assets, and make acquisitions. 

They can now

1) declare a dividend

2) trigger MOASS due shorts not being able to payout the dividend due to the üí©load of shares they owe

3) Sell shares at peak squeeze

4) Make acquisition with the free $1B they just made

2021-04-13 16:57:17,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion the company was never a bad company but it didn't adapt to the rapid changes we as a society were having ask sears, or blockbuster right the squeeze help them enormously it sure did but they're realizing finally that they need to retire their dinosaurs that they had on top and the best way was papa Cohen and it seems he has the total drift of the company because is doing the same moves he did on chewy. So basically we are not a meme stonk anymore this company has fundamentals and a vision to the oncoming future we are playing catch up still but GME is running now not just trying to walk, and they best way to thank us is by recalling most of their borrowed shares and make the Hedgies to pay for trying to kill this company.

2021-04-13 17:06:47,wallstreetbets,"the bear thesis has been obliterated today. Now it's a question of where the stock will consolidate, and just how much it will grow in the coming years. This is ignoring the pink elephant in the room on a unicycle with an economic ICBM strapped to its back that is the looming infinity squeeze"
2021-04-13 18:53:21,wallstreetbets,"This is good and bad.  It's good because paying off debt frees up cash for other things and I'm sure there were negative covenants that now are no longer a limiting factor (though I dont know what they were, haven't looked)

It's bad though, because the business is still hemorrhaging cash.  They need cash to fund the turnaround or they're going to have to keep taking it from investors.

GME remains the most interesting stock in the world.  If only apes would shut the fuck up."
2021-04-13 17:09:51,wallstreetbets,"Unreal news (also the part of it mentioning of how this removes the restrictions the bonds placed on acquisitions, dividends etc) price jumped 1%... If this was 2 months ago the price would have jumped much more than fucking 1% on that news...

Manipulation at its finest, thanks SEC, once im outta GME fuck your market in done and I'm sure there will be a lot to follow"
2021-04-13 17:11:27,wallstreetbets,That shoots down all the negative share offering stories

2021-04-13 17:16:10,wallstreetbets,This increases the chance that these HFs get margined called. They're absolutely screwed.
2021-04-13 16:44:45,wallstreetbets,"Well, now we know who has been selling stock this week... Or at least, it's likely GME. They have some time to report a sale under their at the market plan, don't they?"

2021-04-13 18:40:56,wallstreetbets,"Could someone answer? I'm just curious what all this really means.

* Is it possible that this was blocking them from selling their stock as well? As soon as they're debt free they can sell shares and generate money to operate on the transformation?
* If a company spends money to pay debt is it then considered less valuable on the market (technically they lost money and therefore value)? Does it mean such news make the stock price fall?"
2021-04-13 16:48:12,wallstreetbets,Doesn't this just mean they're going to issue stock as they announced a few weeks ago to get finance?
2021-04-13 17:22:06,wallstreetbets,"Literally the first time I've ever seen people get so excited over a call of a massively ITM bond.

This has been expected for months. Was even in the 10k IIRC."
2021-04-13 16:25:01,wallstreetbets,So they got free money by selling shares to apes and then they pay the 10% loan? Apes like to give their money.

2021-04-13 17:50:27,wallstreetbets,"I swear to god this team running the show are so smart. So can they actually announce a dividend on 6/9? If so that would mean if no one recalls their shares, GME can still issue a dividend and there for screwing over the shorts anyway?"

The long term debt (equivalent of a mortgage on your house) they had was 200 million. And now it‚Äôs gone.

I think you're reading a bit too much into these, since they're all still reported. 

There's largely a sell off in retail GME, that shows in the L2 data. 

Additionally there are block trades going down, probably to deal with options this Friday.

So far there's no evidence of what you're claiming. Why would prime brokers put themselves in a position to be jailed for an underwater hedge fund? It just doesn't make sense. 

Unfortunately for you guys there isn't a big retail demand for a stock that's at a 3900% ATH. 
Most sane folks know to stay far away from that shit. And so the trend the last well few weeks is people selling stock they bought with funds they cant afford to lose.

You're in a small echo chamber when compared to the market itself."
2021-04-13 18:46:03,wallstreetbets,"Timing matters. It's exceptionally volatile and it's the lowest its been in a while. Stands to reason it'll climb at least from volatility in the near term.

2021-04-13 17:50:14,wallstreetbets,"Putting aside the debt and further lease obligations, They have 492m in AP which is a liability they have to pay in the near term and had a cash flow from operations of 126m last quarter. If they‚Äôre spending 40% of their cash in retiring senior notes it basically makes it a certainty they‚Äôre going to use their shelf offering to dump the maximum number  shares as possible onto the market so they can meet their current cash obligations unless there‚Äôs some sudden spike in physical video game disc sales this quarter."
2021-04-13 18:15:42,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention Walmart has much larger storefronts than GameStop does. You find a GameStop in a strip mall so if GameStop wants to buy out of their lease it‚Äôs no big deal as the strip mall can just rent the space to someone else. If Walmart decides to close the literal warehouse of a storefront that was built for them I‚Äôd imagine that would be a little more tricky to do. Who the hell would fill that space if Walmart left (nobody). And to your point, GameStops future lease obligations are quite microscopic compared to other retail giants."

2021-04-13 17:47:48,wallstreetbets,GameStop may do what overstock did and issue a digital dividend.  Overstock issued 1 stock for each 10 stocks you owned.  Link with more info.  https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/overstock-is-paying-a-digital-dividend-and-it-gets-really-interesting-now-15037958
2021-04-13 17:19:42,wallstreetbets,"Buutt, GME hasn't paid a dividend since March, 2019.  There's no dividend owed by the shorts unless the underlying pays a dividend.  Since GME didn't pay one, the shorts don't have to either.  

I'm no financial expert, but I think they just used on-hand cash to pay off some long term debt.  Still good news for us apes.  Might put some upward pressure on the price."
2021-04-13 17:01:04,wallstreetbets,Not sure you understand how anything works üòÇ
2021-04-13 17:15:49,wallstreetbets,"But even if the shorts have shorted 140 million shares, at $1 is it gonna have any impact at all?"
2021-04-13 19:35:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah good point i suppose. Wouldn't it be more prudent though to sort of  ""drip out"" shares say half a million/month if needed (give/take depending on cash flow and share price) throughout the year rather than dumping 3.5 million shares at once? Dilution would be minimal (only 5% total even they did dump them all) and they'd still get the cash needed."
2021-04-13 18:23:47,wallstreetbets,"It's crazy what BS people latch onto and try and portray as doom and gloom.  

What do people want?  GME to sell on Ebay and pay Ebay fees and PayPal fees?

But yeah, Walmart is pretty fucked for that 18 Billion.  No one talks about it though.  God forbid, it might actually tank the price.  18 billion is a stack of 100 dollar bills, all piled upon each other, 18 times the height of what the World Trade Centre was.  That's how big 18 billion is."
2021-04-13 17:22:19,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.  Businesses pay bills like rent/electricity, as it aids in their sales/making income.  It is one of the things that makes a company money.  Like paying employees.  Should all GME employee wages for the length of their contracts be added together and called debt also?  Used to be called Cost of Sales on accounts up until recently."
2021-04-13 18:00:04,wallstreetbets,"With how weak the stock has been this week, this froth is frothy. They can‚Äôt expect to sell into 250 or 300 and not crash the price in minutes."
2021-04-13 18:01:15,wallstreetbets,"Lowest in a month, but massive compared to the past year on average. It‚Äôs possible this stock price movement is them selling to raise money and they‚Äôve not yet disclosed. Key question is how long do they have to disclose."
2021-04-13 18:31:22,wallstreetbets,"Because the board is in this for long term shareholder value and has a fiduciary responsibility around that. Screwing over the shorts is not their goal, and if they do so at the expense of normal shareholders, they can be sued, quite successfully, both by the shorts AND the shareholders, potentially on a personal basis."
2021-04-13 18:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Nah, calling someone a ""boomer"" is like calling someone a ""retard"" we aren't legit saying everyone is literally retarded, it's a state of mind or used to describe an action. I'm sure I've said and done plenty of boomer things in my life and I'm not even 40. And I know I've done plenty of retarded shit, but I'm not mentally retarded (I don't think)."

2021-04-13 18:58:09,wallstreetbets,I hope your pockets are deep man thats the nicest thing i can say
2021-04-13 17:02:00,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs one of the best ways to blow up shorts. GME only pays dividends to the shares they issued. But everyone holding a share is entitled to the dividend payment, the shorts who borrowed and sold them short are legally obligated to pay whatever dividend it issued to whom ever they sold the shares to (naked, synthetic, etc.. all of them count)"
2021-04-13 17:06:35,wallstreetbets,You can see what happened to $RKT when they issued their dividend to try and shake shorts.
2021-04-13 18:20:39,wallstreetbets,"look at the RKT 3 month graph. The spike to $40 was when their CEO said fuck you to the shorts and issued a special, one time only $1 dividend"
2021-04-13 17:07:17,wallstreetbets,"If i borrow your stock to short it, you still technically have ownership of the stock.   When the dividend comes, whoever borrowed your stock is on the hook to do one of two things.   1)  Buy back the stock and return it to you so you can collect your dividend, or 2) pay you the dividend out of their pocket. 

This ultimately results in two things.   Shorts cover their position and buy back their stock they borrowed, or the short position holder spends more money to keep their short position and just cover the dividend cost out of pocket to whoever their borrowed the stock from.

If someone is short say 100000 shares, and maybe their position is down 20% but they expect it to recover, it may be more cost effective to just pay out the dividend and wait for the stock to go down.  Or of course someone in the same position who doesn't have the $100,000 capital available may be forced to buy shares to cover their position.

Long story short, anyone short either needs to spend capital to continue their short position or buy back stock to cover their position.   Stock either goes up from buy backs, or short holders lose money.   Win Win."
2021-04-13 18:10:42,wallstreetbets,"To me, this is probably one of the best outcomes for apes. Hedgies can't just offer cash, they will have to buy their shorted portion of the ~70m Gamestop coins out there. Coin prices rise to astronomical numbers as each hedge fund tries to get their hands on them first, before the next HF."

2021-04-13 17:42:48,wallstreetbets,"Missing the point. Paying this debt off removes restrictions, one of them was they were not allowed to issue dividends. Once it‚Äôs paid off then they will be able to again. If they so choose to. I think a special dividend of $5 would send a nice message to the shorts  üòè"
2021-04-13 17:03:00,wallstreetbets,"Hah, I assure you I understand this."
2021-04-13 17:20:42,wallstreetbets,"140,000,000 impacts"
2021-04-13 18:12:43,wallstreetbets,"Right, but what if the dividend is $20? $1 was just an arbitrary number thrown out there as an example."
2021-04-13 19:50:55,wallstreetbets,"People can think of any reason under the sun to shit on GME and I don‚Äôt understand why there‚Äôs so much hate. They are making moves and people are still out there saying that this company will be bankrupt before the year ends. Then you‚Äôve got the TSLA gang who are glamorized for holding a company that barely (and I mean barely to the point of not being able to focus on production of new, perhaps more affordable/accessible vehicles) meeting production obligations. The first company to come out with an EV under $25000 sticker price is going to absolutely steal potential TSLA buyers at that point. No shade at TSLA but I could go on about their shortcomings and somehow that is a better investment than GameStop

Edit: I almost forgot, that 18 billion is a literally fuck ton of money but with Walmart‚Äôs market cap being what it is, I don‚Äôt think it is a huge problem for them."
2021-04-13 17:39:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they should. Do you not know what liabilities on a balance sheet are? All liabilities and business expenses are in the name of making more money. Doesn't mean you can just magically wish them away or that they don't exist.

It's a little sad people are willing to subvert accounting 101 and spread ignorance just because you like the stock lol."
2021-04-13 18:48:41,wallstreetbets,"That's fair, with how volatile the stock is it doesn't seem wise at all to me and it implies they believe they are significantly overvalued at a market cap of 9.87B which seems low for their goals."
2021-04-13 19:43:01,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt it bad for business if your company is heavily shorted though?

2021-04-13 17:08:54,wallstreetbets,G
2021-04-13 17:04:59,wallstreetbets,"I see. So essentially after shorts bought 10 shares and gave an IOU to 30 people that they have 1 share each, shorts need to pass 1$ of the dividend to 30 people, for a total of 30$ dividend, or get taken to court for financial bullshit? Does that sound approximately right?

Now how does receiving a dividend work? If I hold 100 shares in eToro, and a dividend of 1$ per share is paid out, does 100$ just appear in my eToro ""this is your available equity"" field?"
2021-04-13 17:05:24,wallstreetbets,That's delicious.
2021-04-13 18:56:33,wallstreetbets,Can you still get the dividend payment if your shares are still locked from swapping between brokers ?
2021-04-13 17:36:17,wallstreetbets,What happened

2021-04-13 18:19:32,wallstreetbets,I thought the company should have had a very profitable year in order to pay such a huge per share dividend?
2021-04-13 17:40:15,wallstreetbets,Can I pay the tribute in installments? Like once a month?
2021-04-13 17:50:48,wallstreetbets,I'm finally popular! Hooray!

2021-04-13 17:23:20,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-13 17:13:28,wallstreetbets,"Yep. And if you sold 50,000,000 shares short, guess what. You‚Äôve got to pay that $50,000,000 of dividends to the people who bought those shares. Not GME. They only pay the dividend to the 70.3M shares they‚Äôve issued. And if you remember from the Bloomberg terminal drops, institutions alone own nearly 100M shares. There are a shit ton of duplicate shares out there"
2021-04-13 17:16:01,wallstreetbets,"That's how it works for me with vanguard. Some brokers will ask if you want to do a recurring investment with your dividends though, meaning theyll put that $100 dividend payout towards more shares"
2021-04-13 17:19:02,wallstreetbets,"Essentially, yes. The person holding the actual share gets the dividend: the shorter has no rights because no ownership. So by the time it‚Äôs bought to cover, the dividends are delivered to the actual owner."
2021-04-13 19:25:25,wallstreetbets,Shouldn‚Äôt be a problem

2021-04-13 17:39:30,wallstreetbets,"Ya, basically no impact. When you figure their loss might be $20-100$ per share a $1 loss isn't much. 

Though this could have a big impact on options hedges. If there are heavily margined or shorted shares as a hedge, it could have a big effect for those people."

Ryan issues X amount  dividend.

Most apes use the dividend to buy more GME.

More stock gets sold. 

More dividend gets paid out."
2021-04-13 17:26:15,wallstreetbets,"This is quite interesting with date April 30, can they announce a dividend payout before April 30 and then the shorts will essentially help for pay for that senior notes and also help pay dividends to shareholders including us APEs?"
2021-04-13 17:25:26,wallstreetbets,"I am guessing if you had a short position of 50M shares, which would be valued at 7B, you can probably afford the 50M in dividends you suggest. Really an irrelevant thing."
2021-04-13 17:33:21,wallstreetbets,"Smoothest of brains here BUT if you opt to automatically reinvest into the stock, does that force the shorts to create a synthetic share because all company issued are taken? And then pay the dividend on that stock making an exponential increase in synthetic shares to later be covered while bleeding them financially???"

AMD holds the top 5 cpu best seller spots on Amazon. This has never happened in the history of Intel vs AMD cpu battle.

Hopefully in the earnings call they mention increasing guidance because algos love that.

Also analyst ratings went up today [https://content.seleritycorp.com/hosted/assets/www/uvK3O8c-DXeZi9U3zBa8kp4oTNVXB7SeR\_IaxsQOBAM](https://content.seleritycorp.com/hosted/assets/www/uvK3O8c-DXeZi9U3zBa8kp4oTNVXB7SeR_IaxsQOBAM)"

Look mom, it's not my fault I'm making the greatest investment of the 21st century by subscribing to tier 6 ultra platonic super sonic sub on your patreon and twitch. But alas, mother will not understand. She has given me a 48 hour cease and desist notice to get out of her house and make a life for myself. What she has left me with is 4000 USD to start my life and get a job. Believe me my love if I could funnel all this useless cash to you I would, I'm not the materialistic type. But my dreadful mother has the account locked and said she will call for my arrest if she sees me paying those ""girl gamers"" again. Unfortunately she doesn't know the great stress and mental turmoil you go through everyday but I do oh queen poki. My life is yours and as is from now on, I will still watch your streams and every proceeding I get from my job will go to you my liege. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è love you!"

2021-04-13 16:06:07,wallstreetbets,"I did read it, and it's nothing but hopes, dreams and a lack of evidence."
2021-04-13 16:13:27,wallstreetbets,"Hopes and dreams? They've already got earnings to their name, and very good earnings I may add, in a field that will grow exponentially over the next few years. Hydrogen is expected to have a production market of $420 billion by 2030, and none of that value has been cooked into the price. With their current market share, that would put them 4x above their current price, 8x with a valuation close to that of Linde Plc. This is assuming they don't expand their operations, which they are, with an agreement to acquire 5 operating hydrogen plants in the US. If you'd like me to cite my sources for any of the numbers I've given, I can very easily do that."
2021-04-13 16:16:15,wallstreetbets,"Who expects the market to be that big? That demand doesn't actually exist. If you dig into where they are currently making money, and what industries they sell to (hydrogen specifically) there is no growth path there."
2021-04-13 16:21:50,wallstreetbets,"You clearly didnt read the DD, because I actually addressed the uses of hydrogen specifically. Add to that the fact that, in the past 12 months, 116,000 shares bought to only 22,000 shares sold by insiders, a 5x difference, suggests that they hold the same belief I do."
2021-04-13 17:12:40,wallstreetbets,"Okay let me address them all individually:

"" I think hydrogen has a better future than EV. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future, the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. ""

[https://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy08/43061.pdf](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy08/43061.pdf)

[https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-hydrogen](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-hydrogen)

Power generation:

Somewhat a moot point. Creating the hydrogen through electrolysis requires practically as much energy as you get out of it later. The only use case here is offline backup generators and remote locations, not standard grid work.  
Steam reforming still requires the use of fossil fuels, so why not just burn the darn NG in the first place instead of adding steps?

Shipping:

Cost is still over triple the cost of  low grade marine fuels used by the shipping industry. Marine fuels prices are subject to taxes that add cost. All the current costs quoted by hydrogen companies are supported by tax SUBSIDIES. So the end economic comparison is that hydrogen is actually significantly more expensive if placed on an even comparison; even with a 40% reduction by 2025.  
Secondly, volumetric efficiency. In order to store liquid or highly compressed gas hydrogen is still not even half as volumetrically efficient for BTU/unit vol. Okay lets even assume that it's used in a giant electrochemical reactor instead of being burned in an ICE or steam engine and you still get like double to triple the volume needed for fuel, and the storage is complicated and dangerous.

Aircraft:

Volumetric efficiency is the biggest challenge I see. Cant store it in the wings, so you lose cargo/cabin space. High pressure tanks have to be protected from vibration and G force that exceed all other use cases. This is expensive, heavy, and risk prone. The commercial air industry is extremely regulated and it takes decades for meaningful changes. The Max debacle is only going to further entrench that paranoia."
2021-04-13 18:22:57,wallstreetbets,"Transport was one of the uses of hydrogen. You didn't address the other uses. Elecrolysis costs are high yes, and it made me do a bit more research into the subject, because I thought any sort of clean energy tax would hurt their profit margin, but what I found solidifies my bullish stance. The byproducts of Coal gasification are a mixture of Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen, alongside some other species. I can't comment as to what they do with the other species, but they use Vacuum Swing Absorption technology to capture CO2 in high purity. They seperate Carbon monoxide from the synthetic gas stream containing Hydrogen and Carbon monoxide, and sell the monoxide too. This gets them much more value for their production prices."

There is another thing with fleet vehicles that affect fuel consumption; The operator.  If an operator starts there truck engine when its 31 degrees outside, goes back inside an leaves it run for 2 hours while they get your days tasks and help someone else load material. They don't think about the 2 gallons of fuel they wasted, their truck is warm. end of story. Multiply that by a fleet, that equals big wastes of money and wear on equipment.

The Democrats will make sure to shine a light on RIDE and help the company in every way so as to get the vote of middle America. The entire infrastructure plan is about winning middle americas votes and RIDE is a prime candidate to show as an example of democrats bringing jobs back AND supporting EV. How many other EV companies are in a position to be able to capitalize on both of those factors in a middle America depressed area that has been robbed of union jobs? Im in already and I I just bought more on this dip. Lordstown will moon over the next year as Democrats and Republicans print money and pour it into the EV and infrastructure deals.
I don‚Äôt care if this company is the worst run in the world, the political agenda is the most important short term play and RIDE knows it.

3) ""Backed by GM ..."" In no sense of the word is GM backing this company. They sold an obsolete facility to a moron who is currently stealing money from investors.

4) ""Lexus is considering this technology"" - Get back to me when Lexus adopts this alleged technology nobody is currently using.

5) ""Partnered with Camping World"" ... Camping World agreed to provide a place to ""fix"" these vehicles, assuming they are ever built. Because Marcus Lemonis truly believes he can make some good money fixing these vehicles, if they are ever built. He's invested exactly ZERO dollars in this company.

I've chatted with a few of my clients, many of which are anxious to see competitive pricing on EV fleet vehicles, but have been left underwhelmed by the lack of options to date.

Additionally they passed off a video of their product to show it as working. The reality was it was rolling down a hill as their current product does not work. As I stated before, it burst into flames.

2021-04-13 18:38:18,wallstreetbets,"All depends on what happens and why they don't finish.  Remember, this isn't a walk in the park type race.  There are dozens of entry's every year that do not finish the race.  BUT if endurance doesn't finish, it will be headlines and look for the stock to drop significantly.  Then the digging into the reason will start.  Was it driver error?  Was it something with the platform that will be in production?  Was it something in the modifications made (beefier suspension and all that).  Those who read up on what (if something does) goes wrong will have the advantage.  The rebound comes in the Fall when they start delivering trucks and the new owners of them start to give it thumbs up (or thumbs down).

Personally I'm hoping for a finish, and under 12 hours (winners typically finish in 5 hours, so give him an extra 5 for first time running, first time electric vehicle in this type of race, and 90 min for the recharge along the way.)

And like the OP said.  Balls of steel for entering a race like this . . . balls of steel.

(I have 38 shares of RIDE, and would like to increase it, but the ol' budget just isn't there to do it)"

2021-04-13 17:13:20,wallstreetbets,"Out of all the start ups, I think RIDE has the potential to last. The reason is that they have a unique approach to their power train.

The hub motor isn‚Äôt that much heavier than an f-150‚Äôs brake assembly..   The weight of each elaphe hub motor is 75 lbs; for comparison, weight of an f-150‚Äôs rotor, caliper,  and mounting bracket is 62 lbs, and that‚Äôs w/o account pads and bearings.

Check it out if you have some time! https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

2021-04-13 16:28:52,wallstreetbets,"They are viable just as a zombie carbon credit source for gm alone. Any car they sell is a bonus. Thats the world we live in friend, subsidized manufacturing, because governments know best how to allocate resources, time has proven that lesson again and again......"
2021-04-13 16:11:15,wallstreetbets,"True they are a start up, but GM has a handle on all the ins and outs of auto mfg so I feel that is a plus in their corner.
Right now I feel one of the things that would be a blow is if the Cybertruck goes live first and has excellent reviews. I dont feel it would put RIDE down, bit may slow the retail side.
But I am a dumb fucking toolmaker so........"
2021-04-13 16:21:26,wallstreetbets,they have a FACTORY
2021-04-13 16:25:44,wallstreetbets,I think that's were GM's factory comes into the analysis
2021-04-13 17:03:17,wallstreetbets,"My thesis? 

People, particularly younger people, are desperately searching for new auto brands to call their own... Tesla, Lucid, and others for sedans.. Lordstown and Rivian for trucks"
2021-04-13 16:00:14,wallstreetbets,"They have actually gotten rid of the ability to place a non binding pre order . 

Any orders placed now have to be binding ."
2021-04-13 15:56:47,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs no way you read my post lol this comment appeared less than a minute after my post was approved.

2021-04-13 19:17:06,wallstreetbets,Do you know how many Teslas caught on fire?
2021-04-13 17:53:13,wallstreetbets,"i'm sure the lawyers appreciate you advertising for them for free, especially when its misleading, unlike the company's literature, and the banner across the bottom of Cramer's interview.  Its almost like they can't really read."

Let‚Äôs see if the Baja truck catches on fire. Hope you positions aren‚Äôt short on this one ace you might be in for some teouble"
2021-04-13 17:22:45,wallstreetbets,In hindsight it would've been a pretty good call lol.
2021-04-13 19:28:00,wallstreetbets,Wouldn‚Äôt 4/16s be the play? Buy the rumor sell the news. What if the truck shits the bed on the 17th ya kna

2021-04-13 19:40:26,wallstreetbets,"The single prototype or the rally race-truck?  Either way, I imagine that they'll comply with production vehicle regulations"
2021-04-13 19:20:23,wallstreetbets,"My maternal grandfather, paternal grandmother, and dad all worked for GM (Delco). I guess that is why this one resonates with me. I was raised UAW."
2021-04-13 19:00:26,wallstreetbets,Yup September will be huge. I love the NFL
2021-04-13 17:46:30,wallstreetbets,U/drreginaldwexley - you should make a post explaining things from the business owner / customer‚Äôs point of view. It would be helpful for investors to understand the mind of the customer.
2021-04-13 18:41:18,wallstreetbets,"The Endurance pickup is poised to have a 75 Mile Per Gallon equivalent.  That's huge by itself.   The Fuel savings from 10 MPG to 75 is how I figure 7 fold savings.  There is another thing with fleet vehicles that affect fuel consumption; The operator.  If an operator starts there truck engine when its 31 degrees outside, goes back inside an leaves it run for 2 hours while they get your days tasks and help someone else load material.  They don't think about the 2 gallons of fuel they wasted, their truck is warm. end of story.   Multiply that by a fleet, that equals big wastes of money and wear on equipment.  This happens everywhere !"
2021-04-13 18:15:29,wallstreetbets,"you can order a whole fleet? awesome, me too!

I like TO TRUCK!"
2021-04-13 19:29:04,wallstreetbets,"Wait ... GM gets their emission credit money, and also gets their parts money?

Shouldn't I just by GM stock?

Who is the customer here?"
2021-04-13 17:33:56,wallstreetbets,"My brain‚Äôs too smooth to do this kind of DD myself, so I have to make money standing on the shoulders of wrinklier brains. 
Also, if I lose my money, I can just blame you when my wife asks me about it. It‚Äôs a win-win, really."
2021-04-13 16:27:35,wallstreetbets,"pretty sad when you accuse other people of being misinformed when the reasons you state aren't even true.  that was nikola that filmed their product rolling 'down hill'

the vehicle that 'burst into flames' was a hand built prototype, and was being pushed to it's limits at the time the fire started.  This was addressed in the earnings call, had you taken the time you took to write your post to do ANY research, you would have discovered that.

are you employed by Hindenberg or something?"
2021-04-13 16:27:36,wallstreetbets,"It sounds like you either have puts, haven‚Äôt done your research, or most likely both. I‚Äôm going to link this post for you to read, which refutes your comments:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
2021-04-13 16:50:07,wallstreetbets,I thought the rolling down a hill thing was Nikola?
2021-04-13 17:40:24,wallstreetbets,"I live near their plant. Can confirm, they have ‚Äúendurance‚Äù trucks up and running. They‚Äôve been pumping out betas for testing left and right"
2021-04-13 19:23:21,wallstreetbets,"You sir are the one who‚Äôs misinformed. 

They HAVE a working product and are showing POC (proof of concept) every day and the Baja race next week will be huge and televised. They obviously believe in their product, otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt be racing in one of the most intense truck races out there. 

You mention the CEO a lot in your comment. You forget to mention how great of an innovator he is. Here‚Äôs just a couple things he‚Äôs done in his days.

Mr. Burns has founded, grown, and sold several successful tech startups: iTookThisOnMyPhone: a mobile photo and video-sharing company (sold in 2007), MobileVoiceControl: the first full speech recognition system for smartphones (sold to Nuance Communications, Inc. in 2006), AskMeNow: a mobile search and information delivery system (sold to OTC:AKMN), Pocketscript: the first mobile electronic medical prescription system in the U.S. (sold to NASDAQ:ZIXI), and Adlink: an electronic advertising system (sold to Gannett Corp NASDAQ:GCI). Additionally, Burns designed and developed a Vehicle Suspension Parameter Measurement Machine for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.

This truck is bad ass to say the least. I‚Äôm looking forward to the RIDE."
2021-04-13 17:23:24,wallstreetbets,"You're getting downvoted but some of your points are true:

$RIDE is being sued in a class action for misleading investors. The original pre orders are non binding; I believe they changed to only binding pre-orders now. Some of the old pre-orders for large amount of trucks trace back to PO boxes or to an apartment, which just can't operate a fleet.

That being said I'm still watching it because a lot OP's research does make sense."
2021-04-13 16:42:14,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean time premium sorry, are you saying its worth to pay the premium for calls right now?"
2021-04-13 18:34:12,wallstreetbets,"Great idea, I'm thinking they'll be affected (like pretty much everyone) by chip/material shortage and other production hurdles (Factory problems), why not? So it might take a while to boom"
2021-04-13 17:01:15,wallstreetbets,Whats a leap? Sorry I only know very basic terms
2021-04-13 16:35:33,wallstreetbets,Why october?
2021-04-13 19:35:20,wallstreetbets,"Your assumption is that the CEO owns shares, which you have zero proof of."

2021-04-13 16:37:42,wallstreetbets,"If you wish, I am steady  FAP for the next  4 years  on both!!!! And thank  you!!"
2021-04-13 18:10:40,wallstreetbets,Solid DD appreciate it mate. Happy that more of these are showing up
2021-04-13 18:44:02,wallstreetbets,good out-loud thinking.  tortoise wins this race
2021-04-13 18:45:07,wallstreetbets,Hahaha balls of steel! That is for sure. Agree with you 100%
2021-04-13 18:25:02,wallstreetbets,"From what they said on quarter report, demand is huge right now. They increased forecasted cost of building factory just to make it bigger and assemble more cars."
2021-04-13 17:04:46,wallstreetbets,"Granted the technology to keep lithium mining and processing emissions low are still damaging to the earth... So there is that wait as well. Just my opinion but the EV boom lead by Tesla is (for Tesla) veering towards the other technologies they have to offer. EV cars alone are not worth what the market is trading them at. But hey everything is booming right now so the hype is real real. Always long, always win."
2021-04-13 18:05:17,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not sure the whole world fully does realize the seriousness of cutting emissions, yet."
2021-04-13 17:13:02,wallstreetbets,"Nah, you don't understand, all my money is in GME and sunk cost theory isn't gonna let me exit until it squeezes or gets to 0 lmfao."
2021-04-13 19:53:19,wallstreetbets,"I am neither long, nor short this crap company. This is financial advice."
2021-04-13 19:25:15,wallstreetbets,"It's not just that it's extra unsprung weight, it's that the motors are stuck absorbing a beating from roads/bumps/potholes."
2021-04-13 18:37:49,wallstreetbets,"Way to assume things. I spend at least a few hours looking into this company, but I really didn't have to in retrospect. I literally heard the CEO of this company say one thing one day (about 20 times actually) and the complete opposite a few months later. He's a massive scumbag and will squeeze as much money as possible out of this company before living out his life a rich man."
2021-04-13 16:08:38,wallstreetbets,I know was just playing I‚Äôm long
2021-04-13 16:22:42,wallstreetbets,I saw someone ask how a worker would go about coming up to the side of the Cybertruck to put stuff in the bed due to that high angle on the side ... and I thought what a great practical observation I certainly had not thought of yet.  I like the Endurance b/c it's like a normal ICE work truck BUT with the EV advantage.
2021-04-13 17:14:32,wallstreetbets,Young people are going to identify with Lordstown and their first vehicle that costs 50k+?

2021-04-13 19:36:37,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no.. I think the truck will get A LOT of PR from this weekend because it‚Äôs the first ever electric truck to do the race. I think it will create hype regardless. Upside seems higher for calls next Friday, although I personally just own shares"
2021-04-13 19:56:24,wallstreetbets,"I hope not, as I‚Äôve been selling a bunch of 11.50 and 12 4/16s against my shares to lower my cost basis a bit."
2021-04-13 19:43:17,wallstreetbets,I have 4/16 12-12.5 Debits but I‚Äôm banking on the major 40%-100% pump to be next week. High risk high reward on both of these plays especially next weeks. Next week FD‚Äôs still dirt cheap the $15 and $12
2021-04-13 19:16:14,wallstreetbets,Nicely done üòÇ
2021-04-13 19:51:19,wallstreetbets,Neither one has airbags.
2021-04-13 19:40:57,wallstreetbets,"Well, for starters, he claims he put in a ""real order"" for a vehicle he's never seen, hasn't been built, has no airbags, has passed none of the government's mandated regulatory tests such as crash, mileage, etc. Doesn't even have airbags in the prototype. Prototype cannot be driven legally on US roads, etc. etc.

I think the ""customer point of view"" is that he's a moron. If he exists. Which he doesn't.

Also, the company is being currently sued and investigated by the SEC for claiming they have ""real orders."" Which forced the alleged CEO of the company to go on CNBC and make clear they have no real orders because they don't have a product."
2021-04-13 19:56:37,wallstreetbets,"Yup. In my days working on sites in the dead of winter, supes and foremen would sit in their truck with the heat on blast all day. Lots of wasted gas and wear/tear on the engine. Good on you for switching to electric, hopefully production of the higher class trucks will start to ramp up to meet the demand in the next few years. That's my one caveat with independent EVs right now - lots of great concepts and engineering, but very few have the capacity for manufacturing to meet demand. I foresee most being great long term investments unless something drastic changes this year."
2021-04-13 19:19:19,wallstreetbets,"In short, I like the truck."
2021-04-13 19:41:12,wallstreetbets,Ride will have plenty of emission credits...google Tesla emission credits and become acquainted with the subject. Ride gained access to the GM parts catalog to save on their own DD and manufacturing. Why pay someone for the stamping of a fender when they will sell it to you for 1/10th the cost of making your own. Ride is independent of GM just has access to parts and specs.
2021-04-13 18:06:28,wallstreetbets,">are you employed by Hindenberg or something? 

Don't give them ideas."
2021-04-13 18:38:05,wallstreetbets,"> It sounds like you either have puts

That‚Äôs not a valid argument. Your entire post reads like you are a bagholder (and surprise, you are). If he‚Äôs wrong or lying you should be able to easily address his concerns individually instead of linking to someone else‚Äôs old post."
2021-04-13 16:43:57,wallstreetbets,"Yea, no. Sorry. I have no time for you.

I'm just trying to save money on this BS pump and dump before they get the ""You invested all that money into a meme stock and lost it"" comments."
2021-04-13 17:53:28,wallstreetbets,It is. That guys smoking crack.
2021-04-13 16:51:37,wallstreetbets,"yeah, the farther out, the more you pay, you're paying for time"
2021-04-13 17:04:38,wallstreetbets,"Just a long dated call option... Typically one that expires over a year, but people use it loosely

2023 call option for Ride is the longest dated one you can get"
2021-04-13 17:44:53,wallstreetbets,you're on WSB and don't know what a leap is? did you get lost and wind up here?
2021-04-13 16:38:33,wallstreetbets,"Mass-Production starts in September, which is the biggest catalyst. So that‚Äôs why I like October. 

However, this weekend‚Äôs race will show the world that this truck is legit, so I think this weekend‚Äôs catalyst is huge too, and maybe next Friday could be a good bet.

Short term calls are a gamble, but then again, we love to gamble on this sub."
2021-04-13 18:50:23,wallstreetbets,Good luck :D
2021-04-13 16:40:58,wallstreetbets,have a helpful hand.
2021-04-13 18:27:25,wallstreetbets,"ya, the whole rape the earth to save the air is def a conundrum, i guess thats why i bought $RIDE instead of $LAC now that i think about it.

Not that i've ruled out LAC... but as far as timing goes, i would have been better off buying LAC, and selling half after it ran up to buy RIDE.  Especially at these prices.

As a consolation, i'll be happy being half-right as opposed to not right at all."
2021-04-13 18:31:41,wallstreetbets,"the united states is a poor measure to judge by, but i'll give you your point.  to that, i'll counter with - just think about being in on the ground floor before they do."
2021-04-13 19:48:41,wallstreetbets,this but unironically
2021-04-13 18:51:07,wallstreetbets,"That video was taken out of context. I‚Äôve seen it 100 times. They don‚Äôt have any actual orders rn. Only pre-orders. But since the media freaked out about it, the CEO said in their last investor call that they will only be reporting real orders from now on.

I have spent 25+ hours researching this company. Demand is extremely robust for these trucks. Commercial fleets will buy these things like hot cakes. 

!RemindMe in 6 months - we can see all the orders that Lordstown has for their trucks."
2021-04-13 16:11:52,wallstreetbets,Hahaha love to hear it. Excited to be on this journey to the moon together ü§ù

2021-04-13 16:53:30,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm. You‚Äôre calling this a pump and dump when it has the full support of the state of Ohio?

Literally do 5 minutes of research. The governor of Ohio, Secretary of State, senators, etc all support $RIDE. This is not a pump and dump. You definitely are short or have puts. 

Good luck getting burnt."
2021-04-13 16:53:37,wallstreetbets,So you're saying to do calls for October?
2021-04-13 17:47:05,wallstreetbets,"Why you being rude and hostile to new investors lol, fuck outta here asshole"
2021-04-13 17:09:12,wallstreetbets,"Question on that - if mass production starts in September, what is the actual catalyst? Is it successfully delivering the first orders? Photo ops/press releases? Reviews from buyers/journalists? 

I'm asking because part of me thinks that the catalyst here (assuming this is successful) will be more gradual and might not come to fruition for a few months. I was thinking about buying calls for Dec/Jan."
2021-04-13 18:14:21,wallstreetbets,Isn't the news about mass production already priced in?

2021-04-13 19:15:44,wallstreetbets,The person you replied to made no mention of the Hindenburg report. Sounds like you are avoiding fair criticisms like the plague. Extremely sus.
2021-04-13 17:07:01,wallstreetbets,"You're really starting to come off as the kind of guy who couldn't figure out a connect-the-dots puzzle if it was literally only two dots.

They're getting $500 million from the SPAC to build a manufacturing facility. It doesn't take a genius to wonder why Ohio would support RIDE. They're not invested in it. It's not their money. But the money will go into Ohio and create jobs. 

Nikola II is what this will be."
2021-04-13 16:59:54,wallstreetbets,i'm saying thats something to consider when you make your decisions. i would never tell you what to do since i'm not you.
2021-04-13 18:49:12,wallstreetbets,Not financial advise...but if you go with Oct and they have a set back of a couple weeks on production you will wish you would have paid the time premium and went to Dec 2021 or Jan 2022 when they are in full swing production. \^..\^

you sir, are rude and hostile calling me an asshole."
2021-04-13 17:14:44,wallstreetbets,"I think that‚Äôs a very good point. In fact, bigger catalysts will likely be when they start to report actual binding orders from customers. Right now, they are pre-production, so they can‚Äôt take actual orders, but it sounds like demand is robust.

I would say January 2022 calls would be a great way to play this as well. I don‚Äôt really mess around with options, I prefer to just buy shares. But January 2022 would be solid I think!"

 I wound up here like a lot of newcomers during the GME wave where this sub had the most traffic its ever had to answer your question"
2021-04-13 18:27:45,wallstreetbets,I do appreciate your advice earlier!!!
2021-04-13 19:53:38,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure if you're aware, but they announced that they were under SEC ~~investigation~~ inquiry last month. That news is much more recent than their announcement of plans for mass production and is a contributing factor in the current price. From what I can see, there were mentions of their mass production plans as far back as November, and there was a corresponding spike in price around that time as well."
2021-04-13 19:59:36,wallstreetbets,He is saying buy with more days to expiration not FDs in case it doesn‚Äôt moon. Theta will have sex with you if it doesn‚Äôt moon. Or just buy shares it looks like a good entry!
2021-04-13 19:00:41,wallstreetbets,"i was going to let it go, but you've decided to characterize me yet again.  This is why i suspect you're just trolling for attention. Its not condescension.  Nor did I suggest you didn't belong just because ''you wound up here.""  You made that association.  I'd welcome any wanderer in search of knowledge, anywhere.  Not the point.  Deflection.

 But, as you claim now, that you came to this sub what is now months ago, during that whole time reading all the posts, you had not yet come to any understanding of options, but could do the ape routine pretty well, it just doesn't jibe.  Gave me the cognitive dissonance willies.

You can call me suspicious.  Even cynical.  Unwelcoming? Not. Unless you're a manipulator and then all i'm gonna do is point out what i think like everyone else, and go about my business.

I hope you learn a lot and have a good life."

2021-04-13 17:00:58,wallstreetbets,I am very bullish on BABA. I thought it could be bad for a while. But I now think we will see 300  a share soon.
2021-04-13 17:55:05,wallstreetbets,I'm with you brother. bag holding since $60s and averaging up.

After that, I started reading reviews and found that there are a lot of people out there who have had bad experiences with SDC, that their product does not address all the same problems as Invisalign, that Invisalign includes dentist follow ups that identify problems early on instead of letting them progress. SDC are a discount brand in a business where quality matters a lot to most people."
2021-04-13 17:10:43,wallstreetbets,"I researched both when I had my teeth fixed and went with invisalign after seeing a lot of negative experiences with SDC.

2021-04-13 16:47:51,wallstreetbets,I have 2 of them in fact
2021-04-13 15:48:46,wallstreetbets,"But, if your confident enough it'll go up a ton by 2023, why not buy slightly less OTM to make more profit?  Your already paying so much time value"
2021-04-13 16:07:07,wallstreetbets,"I hope so but i still closed out before 4:00pm. Gonna get back in at open barely OTM. If you like losing money you should do the same, my plays are as consistent as they are bad"
2021-04-13 15:15:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah the 22/23 calls he‚Äôs just going to have to hold
2021-04-13 16:08:25,wallstreetbets,Because deeper OTM is ‚Äòcheaper‚Äô

I‚Äôm new to options but isn‚Äôt the lower theta part of what you‚Äôre paying for in the premium? If you didn‚Äôt time things right you can keep holding it?"
2021-04-13 16:16:13,wallstreetbets,"It was an exageration, but basically it has both a lower chance to actually print and lower delta compared to a lower priced option.   Yes, theta decay is slower"

2021-04-13 18:23:31,wallstreetbets,Thems the plan. I thought to try it since the premiums are so juicy. Do you think it‚Äôs a good idea to do this regularly on the current hottest stock going forward?
2021-04-13 15:27:07,wallstreetbets,Yous prolly a broke ass beech
2021-04-13 18:34:47,wallstreetbets,"I am selling CC on it. Using the premium to buy more shares, and if they get called away, sell puts at or under your CC strike, and use the put premium to buy more shares. Got almost 15 shares for 'free' doing it this week and only doing CC's/CSPs with 25% of my GME position. It's exclusively how I am growing my GME position. And it drops the cost basis on my Hodl 75% because they are just free shares"
2021-04-13 18:36:15,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, if you sell $100+ OTM with 1 week till expiry, that‚Äôs like $350 a week. If it jumps big, like say it goes up to $200 at the beginning of next week, you could roll it slightly up and out to a point where you‚Äôre comfortable letting go or to a point that‚Äôs a net even trade. 

I‚Äôve got two lots I‚Äôve been doing this on for the past 3 weeks or so and have made ~$3k doing it (and that‚Äôs with being fairly conservative with my strikes). I‚Äôd wait it out this week though, IV is on the low side for what it has been and I have a feeling we might see a run up next week. Or you can pick your strike and just set a limit order for the premium you‚Äôre happy collecting, just make sure to be aggressive with your offer considering IV and current price."

Also making 8 bucks on 100 is the same as making 80k on a million percentage wise. Get ur bank up and u will know what I‚Äôm talkin about. Ull love a 8 percent gain when u have enough money"

2021-04-13 18:23:00,wallstreetbets,Excitement run up today. Momentum will keep tomorrow part of the day. Post demo day open will have volatility and if demo day is well received a major jump. This could set a new floor of support too.
2021-04-13 16:29:16,wallstreetbets,"Hello from /r/thetagang, I likely sold you those calls."

2021-04-13 15:46:52,wallstreetbets,Should‚Äôve closed it last week knowing demo day was tomorrow and the inevitable run up. Depends on your expiry though if you got time expecting a drop off a little bit after.
2021-04-13 15:12:17,wallstreetbets,The IV is extremely low
2021-04-13 14:52:23,wallstreetbets,"Tmrw, double click day"
2021-04-13 15:59:03,wallstreetbets,It did soar during demo last time but that was also cause of the GME hype at the time
2021-04-13 19:09:08,wallstreetbets,Bearish or bullish spreads? Seems like a rough day for PLTR theta gang. I totally misplayed my CCs.

2021-04-13 19:50:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah similar boat; can't get a good price on rolling up and out either.  I guess I will accept being exercised and buy back in or wheel back in if I have to.  It'll probably have some sort of dip in the next month or two anyways, and since I've been selling 7-14 dte ccs, my time basis is near zero anyways.  IVs are kind of low across the board; should have waited to sell ccs."
2021-04-13 15:55:26,wallstreetbets,It expires this friday
2021-04-13 15:55:51,wallstreetbets,Who knows? Chances are itll drop tomorrow after the last minute hype-surge today.

2021-04-13 16:08:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I sold my 4/16 calls. If DTE was further out then I‚Äôd hold through but you know why it‚Äôs called FD
2021-04-13 17:54:46,wallstreetbets,I did that awhile ago and even got the approval email
2021-04-13 16:57:49,wallstreetbets,When is earnings?
2021-04-13 16:59:34,wallstreetbets,Also I can‚Äôt keep track of how it goes because I‚Äôll be at work. Is there a good resource to be ahead with news before a potential sell of happens ?
2021-04-13 15:58:18,wallstreetbets,So ur saying it‚Äôs gonna rocket tomorrow?
2021-04-13 17:54:39,wallstreetbets,Remind me 3 days

2021-04-13 15:28:29,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs pretty low. Last few days it was in mid 60s and maybe 3 weeks ago was 90s-100
2021-04-13 15:26:55,wallstreetbets,What makes 75 IV low?
2021-04-13 18:03:23,wallstreetbets,Give them a call is all I can add. Good Luck!
2021-04-13 17:05:26,wallstreetbets,TD Ameritrade says may 4 but sometimes that‚Äôs a little off
2021-04-13 17:06:53,wallstreetbets,"I plan to just watch the demo day, I signed up for it. But since your call is so far out, why not just sell weekly calls at a higher strike price say 20% OTM and do diagonal spreads?"
2021-04-13 15:59:40,wallstreetbets,I dont know what it's to do tomorrow.  I know it made a significant move up today as a result of demo day tomorrow.  Are you suggesting it just went up arbitrarily today and demo had nothing to do with it?
2021-04-13 17:22:53,wallstreetbets,$30s about to print heavy for the retards
2021-04-13 17:10:17,wallstreetbets,"to be fair, i bought these March 1 haha"
2021-04-13 19:28:14,wallstreetbets,My highest is a  25 strike my lowest is 21
2021-04-13 15:43:38,wallstreetbets,So you don‚Äôt think IV Crush will happen?
2021-04-13 17:26:42,wallstreetbets,So keep my call and then sell CC at a higher strike? I have been selling some. I actually have 3 CC selling this week for 25.50 may get called ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

2021-04-13 15:44:28,wallstreetbets,"Not drastically, no. Maybe if the IV picks up tomorrow it could get crushed later on though."
2021-04-13 16:01:52,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it went up today because of demo day.  I cant say 100% for sure it'll go higher tomorrow, but I'd wager on it, thats why I bought calls yesterday.  Nothing in this market is a guarantee, but if tomorrow is anything like today, its gonna be nice for my calls."
2021-04-13 15:49:15,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm convinced, just added 10 30 C 4/16"

2021-04-13 14:45:51,wallstreetbets,The best part about a jnj yolo is that all you ever have to do now is just buy big dips and hold and you‚Äôll be set for life after about 35 years!  Congrats!
2021-04-13 15:13:21,wallstreetbets,Right after this I looked up JNJ and the first thing was an article about suspending the vaccine over blood clot concerns
2021-04-13 15:20:20,wallstreetbets,ur fucked their vax is crap
2021-04-13 14:54:05,wallstreetbets,JNJ def looks tastey rn

2021-04-13 16:28:46,wallstreetbets,YOLO? On JNJ? Not. You may have another $2 grand of upside tops.
2021-04-13 15:46:20,wallstreetbets,Will they recover or was this the nail in the coffin?
2021-04-13 14:52:19,wallstreetbets,3dte if these print OP won't need to wait long.
2021-04-13 15:50:39,wallstreetbets,"Correct. They also had asbestos in their baby powered couple years ago and didn‚Äôt really affect their price at all. I‚Äôm staying away out of principle, but they‚Äôre so big their vax fail probably doesn‚Äôt even matter"
2021-04-13 17:53:28,wallstreetbets,There's talk that the JNJ vaccine actually had no relation to the blood clots. All 6 people that had those symptoms were women between the ages of 18-45. Could have been caused by child-bearing or birthcontrol. We'll see
2021-04-13 15:00:08,wallstreetbets,"According to WSB rules, this technically isn't a yolo, but I'm just thankful that it's not another gme post.

Then there's also the dude that's been trying to post dd that turned $4k into $440k.

Fuck the retarded apes that are not only costing themselves, but also og wsbers serious tendies."
2021-04-13 14:53:26,wallstreetbets,"maybe OP is just broke, could still be a yolo the strike/expiry def seem pretty yolo"

2021-04-13 17:23:01,wallstreetbets,"Mainstream stocks just suck. I dont get the hype. Watched a video last night about a so called ""analysis"". Tesla sold 5 k more cars than expected, stock will be at 10 k to 20 k in 2024... 

What are those people talking about... PE of 1000000 or what?
Volkswagen (with its brands) is selling more EVs than Tesla... and actually makes money with its cars.

Can somebody explain that level of hype? 
I actually like Tesla a lot, but it all seems a bit much."
2021-04-13 14:44:26,wallstreetbets,dont. shit cars
2021-04-13 15:00:45,wallstreetbets,"If I cum am I done, or I get a 2nd round ?"
2021-04-13 18:23:28,wallstreetbets,"Volkswagen has over 100 factories worldwide, 80% of which will be near useless without significant $$$$ invested over the next 10 years.

BEV upfront cost parity is about 4-6 years away. Meaning consumer demand is going to go GME over EVs very soon. Gas cars will be something that only rich people will drive soon, especially if the price and inflation issues keep up.

VW cannot come close to sustaining its business without gas car revenue, whereas Tesla has been cash flow positive for nearly two years without selling a single gas car.

Tesla is also in a better position with debt and pension obligations than all other western automakers.

Even with these facts, VW is better positioned that practically every other legacy auto maker out there."
2021-04-13 17:29:27,wallstreetbets,"Volkswagen numbers included plug-in hybrids and hybrids. Right?

Tesla still owns a the global position. Double Volkswagen position."
2021-04-13 17:28:54,wallstreetbets,Something something... battery factories... future priced in... I don't get it either.

2021-04-13 17:59:31,wallstreetbets,"I did read the english and german report... sounds like pure EV to me (but I could be wrong, did not look at the numbers in detail).

I think that too, Tesla has a great brand. Dont see that brand driving a lot in Italy, Germany or France... but time will tell.

If Tesla would build 2x as much cars as Volkswagen its evaluation would still be wrong today, right? And it is not even close. Also, they dont make money on cars right now, if Co2 certificates are gone because other brands are building EVs its not good for Tesla.

If Tesla would cost 3000 $ today would you repeat the same arguement to tell me why? If yes, it is not worth anything, right? Because the evaluation is not a result of your reasoning.

... again, I like the company. I just liked them more when they were not the cool kid in town.

Its all based on Kathy Woods story of Tesla cars that will pay for themselfs by sending them out with a cab mode (would not send out my car that way, but ok).
Not saying its impossible, but a big big ""if"", right?
I do not see that as possibility by current laws in any country as well. 

Am I missing something? 
So... many ""if""s in the way, but great future? For sure. A 3 trillion dollar company? Bitch please."
2021-04-13 17:38:39,wallstreetbets,"I do get the growth story, its perfectly fine, but when it then grows like expected people applaude like Jesus came to the super bowl to show some backflips on alligators, just to argue it should therefore be even higher.

I am pretty sure those ""experts"" have some very nice call options before they go on tv. 
Everybody here knows its speculation (and we all know that can be a lot of fun), I dont think everybody out there knows it as well. They are just getting fed by the main stream media.

Is that opinion too hard? 
Any other opinions?"

2021-04-13 18:59:27,wallstreetbets,"The comparison to Netflix is interesting.

The difference is, it was obvious that it was possible to deliver movies and TV shows digitally.  The only obstacle was technological.  They were hard problems, for sure, but technological problems are always solvable if you have the right people.

I have seen no hint of how GameStop (or any third party) can deliver console games digitally since the digital delivery is owned by the console manufacturers, who have absolutely no reason to let anyone else in.  Their problem is not technological, it's a business problem, and no mention has been made of anything resembling a business plan.

Of course PC games can be delivered digitally but taking on Steam would be a huge uphill battle.  Many (much bigger companies, including Amazon) have tried and Steam still has 75% market share or whatever."

Scammed Mattel to the point of bankruptcy with the worst M&A transaction ever;

Created a shitty investment management firm that returned loss after loss before selling it to a friend;

Created several shitty PE funds that have closed down and also provided nothing but loss to his clients;

Created some of the most boring ETFs that are as safe as you can get, where even his small-caps' is losing to the SPY YTD; and

Used to lie about being a billionaire.

Glad to see he's opining on the market."

2021-04-13 15:26:11,wallstreetbets,Completely agree with Kevin. That's $1 billion IPO is gonna be used to jumpstart the company I to e-commerce and other plans Ryan has in his mind. Bad for short term since price go down due to more supply in the market but long-term it's a good buy because assuming GME uses the IPO funds to remake the company I have high hopes

2021-04-13 17:26:32,wallstreetbets,So did he say shorts r fuk?
2021-04-13 17:33:31,wallstreetbets,It's so fucking pathtic that this is still going on months after the short lol

2021-04-13 17:36:25,wallstreetbets,Why does he have such an animated face. Looks CGI
2021-04-13 17:40:19,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs so cool to think that the generation that grew/spent early adulthood up watching Shark Tank are revisiting these figures like Kevin O‚ÄôLeary and Mark Cuban in this new but rated context of making money on a good and/or risky financial bet.
2021-04-13 17:45:53,wallstreetbets,"Used pc parts, I'm telling ya if Gamestop started selling and buying in used parts at their locations nationwide they may very well thrive"

2021-04-13 17:56:51,wallstreetbets,I like the stock
2021-04-13 17:57:09,wallstreetbets,"In all honesty, we saw GameStop adding graphic cards not too long ago, what if they go full blown build-your-own Gaming PC and you can go and pick all the parts and have it built right there wouldn‚Äôt that be sweet?"
2021-04-13 17:57:36,wallstreetbets,Can I please just... rub your bald spot... just one time Kevin... ples.... pet ape.... nice ape...

2021-04-13 18:10:15,wallstreetbets,So buy more GME? I just really like the stock
2021-04-13 18:10:42,wallstreetbets,Kevin OLeary and his wife killed someone while they were fucked up boating in Ontario two summers ago. He's done a good job covering that up I have to admit.

2021-04-13 18:12:07,wallstreetbets,Spoken as a true chevalier du tastevin.

2021-04-13 18:13:30,wallstreetbets,Dude on the left looks like Nick Cages hairy brother
2021-04-13 18:13:54,wallstreetbets,"Nobody should be trying to promote Meet Kevin imo. He allegedly knows Vlad, he was ripping DFV before/during the congressional hearing, and he seems to be pushing robinhood/Webull pretty hard."
2021-04-13 18:14:16,wallstreetbets,"Mr. Wonderful, this is a Wendy‚Äôs..."
2021-04-13 18:14:46,wallstreetbets,The guy on the left smiles in a way that makes me uncomfortable. I‚Äôll ease my nerves by picking up a few more GME
2021-04-13 18:15:29,wallstreetbets,Is that my boy Kevin?!?!
2021-04-13 18:15:38,wallstreetbets,"GME could

1. Start their own version of GeekSquad to service IT/tech needs for all the people working from home now

2. Create their own version of Steam

3. Create their own version of an investment crash course online. ""You want to go to moon, you'll need more than a PS5, for $399 you can invest in yourself""."
2021-04-13 18:20:15,wallstreetbets,Is that a shark tank background
2021-04-13 18:20:42,wallstreetbets,Bullish!!
2021-04-13 18:22:36,wallstreetbets,I mean he‚Äôs a consistently failing businessman himself. It‚Äôs like taking casino management advice from trump.
2021-04-13 18:29:58,wallstreetbets,One of us!
2021-04-13 18:30:24,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-13 18:37:02,wallstreetbets,I have a feeling GME could have doubled their earnings if they'd just leaned on selling Gamestop merchandise.
2021-04-13 18:37:55,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt love Kevin O‚ÄôLeary as a guy, but when explaining the stock market he‚Äôs like a wise master teaching you about the secrets of life."
2021-04-13 18:42:00,wallstreetbets,"When DFV exercises the shares on the 16th, will the price dip on that action alone?"
2021-04-13 18:43:00,wallstreetbets,"Idk my opinion is that GameStop over the last 5-10 years as a brand has been such generic sterilized gamer crap. Never anything interesting or unique, just the same 12 funko pops next to their games"
2021-04-13 18:44:43,wallstreetbets,Why does this look like a deepfake?
2021-04-13 18:45:18,wallstreetbets,I love those two blue balls above Kevin‚Äôs head for nearly the entire interview.
2021-04-13 18:49:11,wallstreetbets,NOT A FAN OF MEETKEVIN
2021-04-13 18:51:46,wallstreetbets,Kevin needs to spend more time learning how to drive a boat without killing people.
2021-04-13 18:57:39,wallstreetbets,Check out XL fleet a lot of people online trying to squeeze this shorts covering and over borrowed.

Now that they‚Äôre aware of GME, once

2021-04-13 19:11:30,wallstreetbets,Is this Live from today?
2021-04-13 19:14:49,wallstreetbets,Just curious how long ago was this?
2021-04-13 19:17:03,wallstreetbets,Now I want a short... That's actually how they market shorts

2021-04-13 19:31:53,wallstreetbets,Never forget that O'Leary wouldn't back a charity on DD cause he couldn't make money off of it.
2021-04-13 19:31:55,wallstreetbets,I love Kevin o Leary
2021-04-13 19:33:49,wallstreetbets,Kevin is a tard and hasn‚Äôt had any success since he sold his company
2021-04-13 19:39:15,wallstreetbets,"And that's exactly why the stock doesn't tend to move around a bit more cheesy than dark like the rest.

I actually remember this game and was so happily surprised to see all the passive aggressiveness as they humble brag and compete over who loves the artist they‚Äôre portrayed as in the movies"
2021-04-13 19:44:27,wallstreetbets,"Good try, Ben Affleck. We can tell it‚Äôs you."
2021-04-13 19:45:22,wallstreetbets,Blessed Kevin
2021-04-13 19:47:05,wallstreetbets,Both Kevins are awesome!
2021-04-13 19:49:44,wallstreetbets,The interviewer seems very giddy.
2021-04-13 19:50:11,wallstreetbets,I almost accidentally bought a bottle of O'Leary wine last week but phew! I realized it was his and would profit that asshole if I did so I backed the fuck off and spent my $15 on a different bottle of vino.
2021-04-13 19:53:44,wallstreetbets,Lets go!
2021-04-13 19:57:46,wallstreetbets,"Not related to stock but game stop needs some plan to become profitable 

Esports,  something ?"
2021-04-13 15:35:39,wallstreetbets,Oh my goooooood the meme is dead
2021-04-13 19:34:47,wallstreetbets,"What a horrible comparison of Netflix to GameStop, Netflix pioneered streaming tv and movies. GameStop is basically a dinosaur at this point selling physical disks. Maybe they can pivot to digital game sales... oh wait. Hmm maybe game streaming... oh shucks."
2021-04-13 17:54:43,wallstreetbets,This sub is on some next level copium lmfao
2021-04-13 18:17:44,wallstreetbets,"You guys know O'Leary is a shitty businessman, right? Look into his history. The guy is a hack."
2021-04-13 18:36:51,wallstreetbets,"Kevin made no good points to justify his point.  He has no idea what Gamestop is and what Gamestops competitors do already OR how the consoles have ALREADY digitized the games.  Neither of these two made real points about the stock.  ""If you're short youre hurting""? How is that so?  We closed at 140 today with nothing but the downside in sight.  107 is the closest next support.  You'd be stupid NOT to be short right now."
2021-04-13 19:01:50,wallstreetbets,"I think they can be successful. However, Microsoft already has a successful Netflix like service in place (Gamepass). I imagine Sony will try to put something similar in place (they are already moving slowly in that direction). Gamestop is going to need to offer something unique, with value. I just don't know what that service is yet."
2021-04-13 19:22:00,wallstreetbets,"If you are valuing it on fundamentals and future business prospects, you'd be crazy to think it's not currently overvalued.  It's future plans amount to: develop new markets where bigger, better companies have already tried and failed, and enter into existing markets where entrenched incumbents have structural advantages that can't be overcome (barring some sort of miracle). That's it."
2021-04-13 14:46:51,wallstreetbets,I can‚Äôt stand how fake Kevin‚Äôs expressions look.
2021-04-13 17:06:19,wallstreetbets,So what happens when physical game media is dead? Next console cycle is gearing up to be the first all digital console cycle. Where does that leave gamestop? What's the long game here?
2021-04-13 17:21:14,wallstreetbets,"He uses Netflix as an analogy in his discussion. Maybe he should use Blockbuster, and you see what happened to that because it was not nimble enough in the marketplace."
2021-04-13 17:34:08,wallstreetbets,Gamestop should die but it won't die and now random shit is giving hope. I love watching you apes try and get economic freedom!
2021-04-13 17:42:27,wallstreetbets,"He‚Äôs seems verrry unsure of himself...pretty funny. No insight at all, this was a ridiculous interview. He seems to be looking down at some sort of notes as well. Probably paid well to say those things"
2021-04-13 17:46:04,wallstreetbets,Murderer.
2021-04-13 19:39:49,wallstreetbets,"oh please, he just wants all of you to buy start engine....

2021-04-13 19:06:20,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain what this is from? My ape brain is confused.
2021-04-13 17:39:41,wallstreetbets,"Jokes aside, my personal view of gamestop is forever ruined by them being absolute pieces of shit while I was aged 8-25, offering me 10 cents for games and selling them for $20. Running cooler, local shops out of business, and directly buying and shutting down EB games (and immediately raising their prices).

Their stock may or may not go up, but my hatred runs too deep to ever give them a penny."
2021-04-13 16:32:31,wallstreetbets,I took it behind the barn and shot it.

2021-04-13 15:49:03,wallstreetbets,The kids of the people who founded gamestop went on shark tank once. I believe Kevin tore them apart as spoiled rich kids: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whx9e5uU50E

2021-04-13 14:37:44,wallstreetbets,"He's fucking right though.  This shit is dangerous af to short.  I was bearish overall GME but just opened a long position this morning.

That plus max pain next week shooting up..."
2021-04-13 14:30:41,wallstreetbets,He is a shark. He said he s not shorting but he could be buying the dips. The guy is a proven successful investor he knows when to buy stuff. It would be dumb to miss out on this
2021-04-13 16:32:04,wallstreetbets,"No he isn't. He tried to run for prime minister of Canada on a Trumpian platform.

He also may have killed someone in a boating accident and made his wife take the fall, but no one talks about that."
2021-04-13 14:46:40,wallstreetbets,"Ehhhh, his [Celebrity Jeopardy appearance](https://torontoist.com/2015/05/recap-kevin-oleary-embarrases-himself-on-celebrity-jeopardy/) says otherwise. Tough to finish almost $3k in the red, but he managed to do it. Sucks that his charity had to cough up that money to get square with Merv Griffin. /s"
2021-04-13 18:20:35,wallstreetbets,"Nope. He's just a [crooked shithead with a horrible business record.](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2016/01/26/news/real-and-shocking-story-kevin-olearys-business-career). Even his investing history on Dragon's Den was subpar at best. But he became famous for being an asshole on a reality TV show, and somehow people think he's a genius.

But, you know, this cult is going to hype whatever supports their worldview, so there's not much of a point in trying to correct you lunatics."

2021-04-13 15:07:00,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs no u/deepfuckingvalue but he‚Äôs alright
2021-04-13 16:32:34,wallstreetbets,He got his wife off a negligent homicide charge without a hitch too.
2021-04-13 16:37:51,wallstreetbets,He's gaming the moonboys right into his hands.
2021-04-13 18:02:47,wallstreetbets,Hope he's smarter in this than he is in politics. He was a fucking disaster
2021-04-13 14:48:42,wallstreetbets,"He‚Äôs quite wonderful, IMO."
2021-04-13 14:54:34,wallstreetbets,Very. Dude is very smart.
2021-04-13 17:28:20,wallstreetbets,Smart and cut throat. He was gonna run a Canadian Trump style campaign for Prime Minster but dropped out really quick when he realized it wouldn‚Äôt work.
2021-04-13 15:01:42,wallstreetbets,"This man could have been prime minister of Canada if only he was French, no French heritage, no Quebec vote. It‚Äôs ridiculous, instead we got the substitute teacher Trudeau making a mess of things. O‚ÄôLeary would have really made Canada a better country."
2021-04-13 17:36:38,wallstreetbets,"He's a bad dude. Drunk boating and killed someone last summer, got his wife to say it was her. Prime example wealth = get out of jail free card."
2021-04-13 15:23:16,wallstreetbets,A real knuckle DRAGON ape.
2021-04-13 15:48:27,wallstreetbets,"I beg to differ. Yes obviously he‚Äôs smart or he wouldn‚Äôt be as affluent as he is. However, I think it‚Äôs more that he has smart people he can get advise from. Just watch the celebrity jeopardy episode with him on it. Dude was negative the whole time lol not trying to hate on him but he‚Äôs kind of a dick and he gets more credit than he deserves."

2021-04-13 19:35:00,wallstreetbets,When it comes to Canadian politics he's a total ass-wipe but in this case I'm happy he thinks GME will do good
2021-04-13 14:15:23,wallstreetbets,Hell fucking yeah.
2021-04-13 14:18:33,wallstreetbets,What does this mean!
2021-04-13 16:34:10,wallstreetbets,"The problem is Netflix pivoted to its own platform. GameStop can‚Äôt put its platform on any major console, the digital PC market is taken up by Steam, MS/Xbox, and Epic, And Amazon, Nvidia, Google and MS/Xbox are fighting over the streaming market."
2021-04-13 17:11:46,wallstreetbets,You think the stock is actually worth 100 plus per share? Serious question.

<*nod*>"
2021-04-13 15:38:55,wallstreetbets,"I think he‚Äôs careful not to go so far as to say it‚Äôs a good stock to own. He clearly stops short (heh, puns) at saying it‚Äôs simply a bad stock to short. 

But he‚Äôs definitely saying the company has truly valuable assets in its IP/brand and in its real estate ~~holdings~~leases. His rationale is that they can, in theory, leverage the visibility of the brand/IP to better utilize the real estate they ~~own~~lease in a new way that drives cash flow by opening up new streams of revenue. 

He says they can ‚Äúhold classes‚Äù in their retail locations, which I don‚Äôt think makes much sense lol. But his point is basically that they aren‚Äôt beholden to using that real estate for retail locations. If they do what Netflix did, and move to a digital distribution model for game sales, rather than a brick and mortar retail model, then they can utilize those spaces for something *else* to drive revenue. 

Any retarded ape can come up with their own ideas for what those retail locations can be used for. The thing that‚Äôs left out of the video is that GameStop now has new leadership coming in who realizes the value of their real estate (it‚Äôs pretty obvious that 1700 locations with 1,200 sq ft per location is valuable (edit: because those *leased* spaces can be used for all sorts of business models, not just retail video game sales)...), who understands the value of digital distribution platforms and knows how to operationalize one (Chewy is a gold standard company as far as e-commerce goes), and who likely won‚Äôt be afraid to turn GameStop‚Äôs current business model upside down (it clearly wasn‚Äôt working).  

So I think he‚Äôs right to say the current stock price doesn‚Äôt *really* matter. Of course, it does matter in certain respects, but ultimately the current share price isn‚Äôt an accurate reflection of where the company will be 6 months, or 1 year, or 5 years from now. There‚Äôs tons of potential, and that potential simply cannot be reflected by the current share price - it‚Äôs yet to be determined whether they can reach that new potential that‚Äôs opened up for them. 

Honestly, the ripple effect emanating from the movement behind GME is just starting to be felt. People are starting to see what DFV essentially saw - a company with great assets being poorly run by shitty executives. The distraction of whether the shorts/hedgies are artificially deflating the price or whether retail investors are irrationally inflating the price has run its course by now, and that has allowed people to finally come to their own conclusions about whether there is actual value in GameStop as a corporation. And it seems like a lot of people are siding with DFV now that the dust has settled.

Edit: Clarified that GME doesn‚Äôt *own* real estate, which is an important enough distinction to warrant an edit, despite completely missing the point of why O‚ÄôLeary sees value in those real estate leases."
2021-04-13 14:18:29,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. So, why are so many people on reddit, twitter, and the media so set on getting us  to sell a good long term stock?

Nuff said."
2021-04-13 16:01:39,wallstreetbets,This has been the case for a while now. Everything you see now is a function of hedge funds trying to delay the inevitable without triggering the nuke.
2021-04-13 17:24:53,wallstreetbets,"In short, he likes the stock."
2021-04-13 15:12:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but tbh one thing is that GME is not a 10 or 20 or even 50$ stock but to think that its real value could reach 300/500 or even more $ the share it might be overoptimistic.

And I say this having invested on GME, I want them to do well and make some money but ATM nobody is sure about wether or not the current 140$ share price is (and how much) inflated.

Then again, for sure short investors should be worried since probably they shorted GME to bellow 10$ and it probably is never going to be that low"
2021-04-13 14:30:23,wallstreetbets,It's a good stock to own at 20 USD - not at the current price.
2021-04-13 17:28:12,wallstreetbets,">He's saying that long-term, this is a good stock to own and that the short thesis of driving this down to $0 is absolutely off the table.

I definitely get that I wouldn't want to be short right now since the value is so hectic. 

Can you walk me through the logic of how this stock is good to own long term at 30x the value that it was last year though? A new board and a new CEO usually don't account for anywhere near that kind of bump. 

It still feels like kind of a dying industry when it is so easy for the game companies themselves to cut out the middle men."
2021-04-13 16:32:24,wallstreetbets,"Idk, I feel like most people in the US already know GameStop and yet it was about to go bankrupt. What does the IP matter if leadership refuses to improve their business model?

GameStop is known as the place people used to go to if they wanted to get ripped off on buying / selling used games and is now known as a toy store. And we all know what happens to toy stores üíÄ"

2021-04-13 15:44:27,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd be willing to bet he isn‚Äôt, and that he won‚Äôt invest until they prove they can do what Netflix did and move to a digital distribution platform. The guy got his start selling software, he‚Äôs very anti-brick and mortar retail. It‚Äôs expensive and unnecessary overhead in his mind. 

He‚Äôs a very shrewd investor. He wants almost guaranteed bets. And right now, GME still has a very unforeseeable future. He clearly sees enough value to be confident it won‚Äôt go bankrupt, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs confident enough yet to give his money to them."
2021-04-13 16:05:59,wallstreetbets,He is... in one interview he said he has 10k invested or something like that.

2021-04-13 18:30:40,wallstreetbets,"Think he just trained himself to alway be smiling when doing interviews and it just looks a bit forced and awkward when he does it. A lot of people get stuff like that drilled into them when learning how to do stuff like interviewing and whatnot. Though I think that's generally bad advice. Just don't look disinterested and be emotive and smile if it's appropriate, but mostly, just look natural."
2021-04-13 14:52:50,wallstreetbets,"Lol this is how the uninformed willingly deceive themselves. 

Did you not already know that literally every single stock has an unlimited upside, while having a limited downside? 

That is the sentiment he is actually alluding to, shorting is incredibly risky due to the unlimited downside."
2021-04-13 14:18:34,wallstreetbets,"Meh I'm probably not as smart as him, but the writing is on the wall that GME will die. We are all getting super computers with fiber at home and consoles that digitally buy games. The next generation of consoles will likely not have ANY physical cartridges or CDs. Solid state storage is getting cheaper by the day. And why would GameStop want to be a Microcenter like store? Nobody goes to Best Buy to go part out a PC rig, they won't do it at GameStop either. It's just way better to sit at home and compare Amazon, Newegg, and 10 others for the best deal than to rely on the stock of one brick and mortar store that you have to drive to that needs to pay the stocker and trucker salaries. Will GameStop becomes some Mecca of game tournaments and hangouts? Doubtful because if we all have good home PCs and fiber, there's no point to paying an hourly rate to be out of your house. I don't see any long term viability. Care to disagree?"
2021-04-13 16:05:24,wallstreetbets,"On one hand, you're right.

On the other, I REALLY don't want a large corp running LGS's out of business, and hope they never do it.

Wait, why are you buying your cards at Walmart/Target?  Find a local game shop, the prices are always far better anyway.  When I played MtG I was getting packs at 75-80% Walmart/Target prices."
2021-04-13 14:41:28,wallstreetbets,Something we clearly don't have...intellectual property. He is referring to the brand name in this situation.
2021-04-13 15:54:57,wallstreetbets,Yeah people are reading way too hard into this. He said the company could have a second kick. He didn‚Äôt say if he thinks that the stock price already has that value baked in. He didn‚Äôt say this shit is gonna explode to $1000/share...
2021-04-13 15:14:06,wallstreetbets,"He meant the actual underlying company, not just the stock price.

GME the company is still in transition from a dumpster fire to a real company.  Thinks look good, but it hasn't really become anything yet."
2021-04-13 17:12:10,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs very intelligent just maybe a little bit on the spectrum

2021-04-13 15:10:32,wallstreetbets,"Basically in the late 2000s,.Netflix I did a similar business shift as seen with what GameStop is doing. Also, GME has a very enthusiastic base, as seen with Tesla, due in part to g*mers‚Ñ¢ and a cult of personality of RC and the stock."

2021-04-13 18:42:26,wallstreetbets,"Yes. E-commerce companies typically trade at a multiple of their sales. 

Net Sales for Chewy for fiscal 2020 was 2.4 billion; their current market cap is 36.29 billion. That's a 15x multiple.

Net Sales for GameStop for fiscal 2020 was 6.4 billion; their current market cap is 9.87 billion. That's a 1.5x multiple.

If we apply Chewy's multiplier to Gamestop, it should be trading at $1400/share."

So their only option is a service in the actual store, which doesn't seem likely to sell. Are they going to do tech repair? Well Best Buy has that market locked down with Geek Squad so you're starting from behind. Classes like Kevin mentioned? Doubtful. Who is going to go to gaming classes. Game nights? This one could work, but I dont see it being massively profitable and your local comic book shop or card shop probably is already better known in the local community for those things. 

I get wanting to think everything is sunshine and rainbows, but theyd need something genuinely revolutionary in the industry to carve out this section of the market."

The problem with the comparison to reinventing themselves as the ""netflix of games"" is that this has been done already. Twice. First with Steam, nearly 20 years ago (yea Steam launched in 2003). And more recently with Xbox game pass. Both of these services offered something innovative. What is gamestops innovation going to be? I think it will be difficult to enter this market without giving customers a compelling reason to use it over competitors."

2021-04-13 14:39:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah brother, it‚Äôs fishy as hell."
2021-04-13 16:32:34,wallstreetbets,"because a stock being a good long term prospect does not mean any price is reasonable. I'm not saying what is and isn't reasonable. but I can look at a stock, believe that company is good long term, and also not believe it's a good buy at $300 a share relative to it's earnings, or even future earnings. there is a point where it's too expensive for even a good long term company. 

Google isn't going anywhere for example. It's a good long term buy. but it's not worth $10k a share today."
2021-04-13 15:11:02,wallstreetbets,Whether or not its a good long term stock doesn't change the importance of position. This is a stock that traded at $5 for years. If it levels out at $130 that is HUGE. People who were buying calls at $500 are going to have a bad time.
2021-04-13 16:53:29,wallstreetbets,"Because if you believe the fair market value of the stock to now be in the $150-250 range, it'd follow that your $350 cost basis is a failed endeavor.

That doesn't explain why they wouldn't have a prevailing sentiment of ""average down your position"".  

But it's not mutually exclusive to think ""retail investors made bad choices in January"" and ""Gamestop has a bright future""."
2021-04-13 15:51:32,wallstreetbets,"The rhetoric seems to have changed though. Now it‚Äôs being called a good long term stock which it might well be, but what happened to the moon? 

It was only a week or two ago that people were still swearing blind that these shares would be absolutely priceless very soon, within a matter of days, and you could sell them for $50k a pop.

Now the story has changed to a decent long term stock, which is way more realistic but let‚Äôs not pretend the claim wasn‚Äôt rockets to the moon."

2021-04-13 14:24:18,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. It's not about the brick and mortar stores. The whole upside is because of the HUGE amount of FREE marketing they've had WORLDWIDE.

They will pivot (which they've said) to different digital ways to do business and they have a pretty solid chance at success purely off the HUGE amount of FREE marketing they've had WORLDWIDE. Lol. Not to mention an actual great team in leadership so far.

Great potential long term. Regardless of diamonds and bananas and squeezes and gorillas and shit."

Let's say you bought the case, motherboard, gpu from them and they have a rep on site that could 1 on 1 build the computer with you and answer questions.  Like my dad did for me. Or I did for friends and my brothers.

Or have some esports players giving lessons and coaching or having watch parties for large events.

Potential is there and they are already a recognized name in the arena"
2021-04-13 14:26:31,wallstreetbets,"i‚Äôd love to disagree, seeing how gamestop might be moving they could be the catalyst to solidify a sort of pc cafe scene in the US just like how Korea has its own scene, and although alot of people do play videogames in the comfort of their own home after close to a year and half of restricted social events, being able to play video games in one spot with all your friends is a good idea to cash out on. Not everyone can afford to make a pc, but people can affor 20-30 bucks for 6-8 hours at a pc cafe with their friends."
2021-04-13 15:03:15,wallstreetbets,"1. ""We are all getting super computers and fibre internet""... uhhh, what? maybe in like 20 years those things will be cheap enough to be ubiquitous, not anytime soon though 
2. ""No CDs or cartridges"". This is true. But their shift isn't focusing on physical games, hardware and peripherals are always going to be needed for gaming and entertainment. If they actually adapt, they won't be reliant on physical games
3. Buying from Amazon or NewEgg is better, maybe, it depends. I will try to get PC components or peripherals locally first. If building a full PC, then yes it is sometimes easier to order everything online, but I personally choose parts using PCpartpicker and then buy the components locally. That's just me tho and this is the most valid point against their long-term viability... BTW you don't have to drive there, they are apparently using doordash to do same day deliveries and normal shipping can also be done too
4. Mecca of tournaments and hangouts, it is possible. ESports are a massive growing industry and anything is possible there. As for hangouts, I used to love going to internet cafes in highschool to do LAN gaming with a bunch of friends. This is not the same experience as playing with them all from home, it is way better. Now if that will ever become popular/profitable, I don't really know. I don't think you can exclude that possibility though 
5. Stock price =/= value. Even if Gamestop fails sometime down the line, there are other factors (naked shorts/FTDs/newDTCrulings/UnitedAPES) that make what O'Leary is saying pretty logical

TLDR; who knows, but I like the stock. 

This is not financial advice. This is one retards opinion."

GME's turnaround is brought on by necessity under very different circumstances."
2021-04-13 17:25:19,wallstreetbets,"Similar? Haha... The companies are not even remotely comparable and that was almost 15 years ago now. That's a lifetime ago in this space.

GameStop still has *nothing* that is in any way revolutionary or industry leading whatsoever. Every potential play or ""pivot"" they could have right now is contingent on entering markets where they're already 10-20 years behind and full of established competitors that haven't just been sitting on their asses. A big part of their main revenue stream that originally got them as big as they are was the used game market where they ripped people off for years buying used games and reselling them for huge margins of profit while cutting developers out of the picture, which only sped up the direct to consumer digital sales landscape so that GameStop and their ilk could then be cut out of the loop themselves. Moving to more of an online focus will still have them be limited to physical sales of products for the vast majority of their revenue stream as they are not a developer, publisher or even a digital delivery storefront of any consequence.

Their best bet in the next few years is shutting down as many unprofitable B&M locations as they can and aiming to become a gaming focused Best Buy and NewEgg hybrid."

2021-04-13 18:37:19,wallstreetbets,"It could be similar to how Hulu started.  Netflix had their selection and Hulu went with a different selection.  GamePass doesn't offer every single game to play at any time. They rotate in and out like Netflix does.  Gamestop could jump in and grab fan favorite games that aren't offered on the other services.  I assume Playstation Now is similar, but have no idea about Steam/Epic/etc."

2. Consoles already sell ridiculous high priced accessories. What is changing is that brick and mortar can't get any cut of game sales once they go all digital.

3. People are increasingly just going to buy the product from wherever is cheapest online. Why pay more? GameStop is just going to be less efficient than someone like Amazon who has bigger warehouses and delivery trucks. They just can't compete at all in pricing for products.

Of course that company has a much broader scope and has their hand involved in a lot more than that but nonetheless. Bing failed to overthrow Google because people weren't using it. Why? I'm sure that's mostly subjective but I'd wager it was primarily due to poor aesthetics overall and lack of piquing interest. Like Google will usually update its logo to represent certain people and holidays, sometimes it turns into a game or a video, etc. Pretty sure Bing never had anything like that. A search engine is simple and 99% of average users can't tell a difference in performance or variance among accuracy/search results.

Tl;dr Bing failed to top Google due to a lack of creativity. Followings can always be divided, look at MySpace/Facebook for an example of that."

Definitely GameStop was cool when I was a teen cause I didn‚Äôt have a debit or credit card and I can take what ever money I had to go buy something fun for myself. Now that I‚Äôm older I have credit cards to buy online and find some deals. With the push of digital games, disc games are going to die down. The last four games I bought were all digital copies and I bought them while laying on my bed not needing to drive anywhere. This is me at my age and I love to game, and if GameStop is brilliant enough, they will find a way for me to hand over my money to them, if not, some other company can find a way and do it."

Plus, like the apple store, what you gonna do with your kids when you go to the mall, what other store gonna baby sit them? Hot Topic? 

I wouldn‚Äôt say B&M is gone yet and if some stores had shit I needed at decent prices I wouldn‚Äôt need Amazon. 

25-500$ for a goddamn hdmi cable, get bent, I‚Äôll buy a pack of 10 for that and take my chances. Same with controllers, console repairs. I mean shoot, GameStop just needs to get into the monthly premium business, 10$ a month and every console cycle you‚Äôre guaranteed a console on release date instead of this bot shit. 

Being poor is expensive, but some parents can give a kid happiness for 10$ a month perpetual but not 599$ + 69$ up front. 

Then when they release a ‚Äúpro‚Äù version mid cycle, it‚Äôs an easy upgrade route to the 10$ a month to just spend 2-3$ more to get that little bit of more juice plus a one time 30$ paperwork fee due at signing and turning in of the old console. They will even transfer your profile and games to the new one while you wait or call you when it‚Äôs ready. 

Console broke? If user damage, 50-100$ replacement, just died of old ass age, same day swaparronie.

Game disc scratched to hell? Bring it in for a replacement with proof of purchase within 1 year and get a lightly used copy free. Use the ole inkjet printer to slap a permanent label on the top of the game disk that basically says it‚Äôs a replacement so they can‚Äôt just roll into another GameStop and try to trade it in for $$ or full $$.

They rent every single store‚Äôs retail space and they‚Äôre eliminating them left and right. That‚Äôs what this has all been about, they are pivoting to e-commerce. Do you know what the e in e-commerce stands for?   
Do you have idea how expensive rent is and how much overhead they‚Äôre going to save by eliminating retail space? They don‚Äôt *need* to do anything with retail space, they don‚Äôt own it! They can simply not renew their lease when it‚Äôs up then boom, retail space isn‚Äôt their problem.  

Now, enough talking about ‚Äúwhat are they doing to do with their retail space.‚Äù   
They‚Äôre moving it online with Ryan Cohen‚Äôs lead, the former co-owner of Chewy, the biggest e-commerce pet store in the world. He knows e-commerce.  

Any other dumbasses willing to announce their stupidity and lack of due diligence?  

Oh by the way, you want DD? Chewy‚Äôs market cap is ~6x their revenue, that‚Äôs what an e-commerce sites valuation looks like. When GME completes their pivot and ends up classified as an e-commerce site Wallstreet would valuate it similar to chewy, which means with GME‚Äôs revenue it‚Äôs stock price will be anywhere from $700-$1100. Who gives a flying fuck about ‚Äúmuh short squeeze.‚Äù If you‚Äôre long GME for the right reasons and not desperate for a short squeeze, you‚Äôre looking at a stock price that‚Äôs so far discounted you‚Äôd have to be a lunatic not to buy as much as possible."

I'm not sure you are as in tune with the consumer as you believe. You know why disc drives are preferable? You don't have to pay the price microsoft or sony put on games on their stores (which are robbery). You can buy physical copy for 25% of that cost and have the same content, and a physical disc you can then trade or sell, or give to a friend/sibling. that is value that digital can never match, not to mention a physical disc and case which some gamers prefer.

GameStop had the opportunity to innovate and move along with the industry in so many different ways and they just stuck with the same old bullshit from the 90‚Äôs and early 00‚Äôs before easy access to high speed Internet and then just continued along even as streaming continued to innovate further.

2021-04-13 17:42:21,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you are making a very good case at all.  My last two experiences with Gamestop:

- Wanted to buy an extra Switch pro controller for a trip i was taking with friends.  My nearest gamestop ran out of controllers, so I went to the Target next door and bought it instead.

- I bought an external hard drive for my PS4 from Gamestop since I wanted one same-day.  After checking online, I realized I could've gotten a better product and cheaper from Amazon and Walmart.

My purchases since then have all been thru Amazon."
2021-04-13 18:32:45,wallstreetbets,"In another comment I wrote on this thread, I talked about how GameStop needs to come up with a better idea to keep its business going. Not talking about stock aspect but actual business aspects, in how they can get more customers to their business and spend money. I wouldn‚Äôt want people to lose jobs, but the mere not wanting people to lose jobs is not how a company keeps running. They have to come up with a strategy, contingency planning in case those strategies fail and other unplanned events occur, and basically adapt and have ingenuity to keep alive. You brought up Barnes and Noble which is basically where GameStop might be at in the business, if they keep the same course they will follow Barnes and Noble. I liked going into Barnes and Noble too and I definitely don‚Äôt want anyone losing jobs, but that‚Äôs how businesses go, if you can‚Äôt keep up and have a way for people to hand over there hard working dollars, it is going to fail. How Kevin said, they have the IP to their advantage and this new wave of fresh air thanks to Reddit to try get out alive and keep going, but staying the course is not the answer. Btw, I don‚Äôt own any of this stock. I would love for it to go up so those Wall Street heads hedge funders can really cry about it. But I‚Äôm just saying they have to come up with some business aspect and not rely on the stock doing the work, cause we all know stocks are fugazi"

2021-04-13 17:56:55,wallstreetbets,"Damn. I was looking for some logical points against the GME hype and some data on shorts being covered but you didn't do that. I've been bullish on gme since January, squeeze or no squeeze, but I can't find any counter DD to the squeeze already happening. The squeeze would be more than a nice cherry on top, but there is no certainty that it will happen. 

Unless you can point to some data that shorts have been covered, you can't operate on the assumption that January was the squeeze."

2021-04-13 19:18:24,wallstreetbets,"I mean, Bloomberg terminal says institutions own 115% of the float. And when you add retail in, that‚Äôs a crap ton naked shares.  Considering anything over 20% is enough for a squeeze, and institutions owning enough for 15% of the naked shares, that‚Äôs pretty close.  Add in retail, and you you guessed it, we‚Äôre in squeeze territory.

You may say, there‚Äôs other stocks with more short than 20%! And you‚Äôd be right. But it takes a crap ton of money, and that money must be buying and holding to create a squeeze. Which is why GME works out so well. So its not only has it happened twice. Looks like there‚Äôs enough shorts, and plenty of holders to create a third. 

Again, this is a casino, so no one knows, but it‚Äôs obviously shorted, and obviously the apes aren‚Äôt going anywhere.  But y‚Äôall should really stop buying my $600 covered call weeklies.

The shorts have not covered their shorts and continue to just keep trading naked shorts and darkpool bullshit to manipulate the price so the can continue to short the stock and when margin finally gets called they have to deliver those shares. See, supply and demand. All the naked and fake share shorting is going to catch up with them. Not only will the shorts have to cover the real shares, they ha e to cover naked as well.

Gamestop is currently irrational because it's price is heavily manipulated, but sure as the sun rising, it'll eventually become rational again. Might take 1 month, 5 years, but it will return to normal eventually.

Currently no good reason to believe that normal price will be anywhere near or above 100$

2021-04-13 18:01:21,wallstreetbets,"To provide some perspective from a long time store manager at GameStop, despite boneheaded company moves over the years, a fair majority of the stores remain profitable year over year. I started as a holiday hire in high school and stayed for a long time, spanning fifteen years. I managed four locations over the course of my time there and each one earned enough money to cover the cost of the individual store's payroll, product and utilities, in addition to generating profit for the corporation.

Things have been getting worse for years at GameStop, but overall the stores still make money and have a lot of loyal customers. Even though you can get your games online or at Walmart, the best stores had staff that were knowledgeable without being overbearing and easy to talk to. They were just fellow gamers who wanted to get excited about new stuff and geek out with you. There will always be a value to that, no matter how much of the industry moves digital only.

My point is that, try as they might, a lot of stores make money, at least enough to justify their extended existence and I don't personally see the company folding any time in the near future. I think we will continue to see certain aspects scaled back. If you've been in one recently, they cut a lot of the unnecessary shit and the overwhelming in your face marketing plastered across every spare inch of wall and shelf.

New leadership is good, but GameStop has had a lot of ""new leadership"" the past few years and they need a steady guiding hand as they develop a new identity or evolve into something else entirely."

2021-04-13 18:06:07,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I'm asking a simple question you just aren't reading it. I'm just asking people for a theory on HOW GameStop would become profitable. And then I can respond to the idea. Like a discussion. I don't think you understand that. For example, if someone says they are going to become an amazing PC BANG then we can debate that idea. Is your brain too smooth for that?"
2021-04-13 18:52:49,wallstreetbets,"I understand the question, and it‚Äôs not one solved over night.  Before they worry about stocking the shelves ‚Äî the need to figure out where those shelves could be located, convince people going to their stores is better than anywhere else, and have enough enough time to shore up their leases ‚Äî and they need to do this while expanding their Omni footprint to give them an advantage and grow e-commerce and digital

As an investor ‚Äî do I think they‚Äôll pull it off? They‚Äôve certainly got the exposure and pulled in the right people. What does success really look like?

I only wish to highlight that those conversations require good faith or they don‚Äôt go anywhere.

It‚Äôs not about me, my opinions or what I do or don‚Äôt understand - it‚Äôs about willingness to have a conversation that separates  person I‚Äôm speaking with from the opinions they hold."

2021-04-13 17:59:17,wallstreetbets,Your reaction is a bit excessive.  I bet you are a well-adjusted individual.
2021-04-13 19:31:59,wallstreetbets,"If they truly, legitimately think gme will fall back to earth, then at no point did they close their short position. A small player or a small firm, sure, perhaps they got margin called. But a monstrous hedge fund/market maker is not going to allow margin to dictate its decision to close its short position. If they legitimately believe GameStop would fall back to earth, they would have a way to avoid getting caught in a squeeze, wait for it to fall, and then slowly unwind their short position.

We saw an initial rise almost purely due to options activity, and MMs having to hedge. At the same time we saw massive hedging, we saw massive institutional ownership, and global pressure. GME was the most traded stock in the world. So even if they did cover, how are they covering in competition with that much additional buying pressure. There is a reason they shut buying off for retail; it would have sent the shares into the thousands at the very least. 

Firms and Wall Street do not play fair. There is a reason why ‚Äò08 happened. The fine for misreporting short interest is literally change to them. What‚Äôs in your pocket right now. Nothing? That‚Äôs what it costs them to lie. 

At the same time even if low priced short positions were closed, a ton of new short positions were undoubtedly opened at the higher prices. Funny enough, if you compare CHWY to GME, they had near identical books, and the same ceo/chair. Except chewy is worth 4 times what gme is worth today. Only difference? CHWY‚Äôs TAM is what, 1/4 of GME‚Äôs? 

I still believe old big institution shorts, if they firmly believe GME is worth squat, can significantly delay any forced squeeze, besides the actual owners recalling their shares."
2021-04-13 19:06:31,wallstreetbets,No dude you don‚Äôt get it. All the hedge funds have been outsmarted by a bunch of 19 years olds on Reddit lmao
2021-04-13 17:56:29,wallstreetbets,"people have been talking about how media Is bought and paid for by the highest bidder to control the narrative, since newspapers. This is news to you today?"
2021-04-13 17:59:22,wallstreetbets,"Is it really in doubt that hedge funds can get favorable articles published or leak tips to the right people? Hell, you can go sign up for prnewswire right now and for 3800 annually you get 3 press releases sent out which are usually picked up by 1000+ online sites. I‚Äôve done it in an unrelated industry."
2021-04-13 19:20:31,wallstreetbets,"By your logic, gabe didn't lie when he said retail drove the price up, not a squeeze ü§ê"
2021-04-13 19:21:57,wallstreetbets,"There are literally hundreds of DD posts on this sub and others pointing to a short position still being likely. 

Dark pools of buying, flat trading with almost no volume, extremely good newsreel with with no price increases, etc etc.

When you post, even in the comments, with negativity - people want to know why. I am still very much hoping u/dw_eve responds to why they went from bearish to bullish today. Otherwise, but you and that user seem like FUD.

You‚Äôre argument is, currently, ‚ÄúYou guys can‚Äôt beat hedge funds. Give up.‚Äù That‚Äôs not an argument. That‚Äôs basically the definition of FUD.

My response is: get over yourself, grow up, and find other people to antagonize. We have diamond hands, deal with it."

2021-04-13 18:21:57,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm sure the stores make money is the corporate overhead I‚Äôm concerned about. They typically aren‚Äôt a profit center and spend more than the stores make. If they can trim the fat at the corporate level, use this new brand to their advantage and transform their revenue streams through different channels then I would say it‚Äôs currently undervalued despite the short interest."
2021-04-13 16:49:11,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, the only reply I have gotten that makes any sense at all."
2021-04-13 17:18:18,wallstreetbets,Because it's already been covered and the drop is the retail investors getting out.
2021-04-13 17:19:41,wallstreetbets,"Is it logical that they covered, yet Melvin Capital has continued to post losses in March.  Is it logical that the entire world was telling people to sell at $40 and then the price shoots up and finds a new triple digit floor?  Is it logical that industry analyst price range is between $10 on the low end and $175 on the high end?  Where is the logic in any of this Gamestop shit?  Something fishy is going on behind the scenes, if you don't want to see it, it's fine, but none of this shit is logical."
2021-04-13 17:35:48,wallstreetbets,The interest is less than 1% while the stock is hard to borrow. Where is this massive interest you are talking about? You are either ill-informed at best or just here to sprad missinformation and fud at worst.
2021-04-13 17:21:00,wallstreetbets,"It would be in his interests to say they had covered, if they are truly still heavily short GME he would not want to admit that information. But to admit that the rise in price during Januarys madness was due to Gamma actually goes against his interests, it points to the shorts not having covered why would he lie about that?"
2021-04-13 18:45:37,wallstreetbets,It was only 4 bucks extra. I selected the option through the GameStop app.

Could've just said you were a conspiracy theorist off the bat, would have saved us both some time."
2021-04-13 18:51:48,wallstreetbets,"Clearly they don't have to be profitable for the stock to go up. I mean, I'm sure it would be nice if they turned a profit. But it's become evident that it isn't necessary. 

But to answer your question. I came up with this idea in three minutes and did zero DD. But you asked, so here goes.

I think they should rent out every location they own (tho most are leased I believe) to companies that are still stupid enough to want a physical location. While also taking all their existing product and warehousing it, then attempt to sell said product through an online business model. But I dont know shit.

Edit: awwww he didnt like my answer. Dont ask stupid questions and you want get stupid answers."

2021-04-13 18:22:04,wallstreetbets,"When was the last time anyone on this website actually physically went to a GameStop or bought something on their website? Probably 10 years ago. Idk how you guys think GameStop is profitable currently or will ever be. They don't sell anything at a good price compared to other retailers and offer no incentives. There's literally nothing there of value. Walmart, Amazon, BestBuy, and many others already sell all the same shit or better or more options. And game sales are going digital. GameStop's walls will be completely empty next gen when there aren't cartridges or CDs. Sure they can still sell consoles and accessories or maybe even PCs or parts, but that doesn't mean they are going to avoid bankruptcy."

Fidelity and blackrock are two huge institutional holders who have lent shares they own to short sellers. I should know, I borrowed 500 from fidelity.
Already spoke with them, nothing to worry about, they‚Äôre not recalling institutional shares.
Both refused last year when GameStop asked them to as they will again this year.

If you‚Äôre in a margin account and want to vote then they might recall those. But that‚Äôs it.

This will be just another big nothing.

Edit proof : https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/how-investing-giants-gave-away-voting-power-ahead-of-a-shareholder-fight-11591793863

GameStop Corp. shareholders vote this week to resolve a fight over the embattled videogame retailer‚Äôs board. But the company‚Äôs largest investors won‚Äôt cast much of a vote.

The three biggest money managers in GameStop reported that their funds held some 40% of shares in the first quarter.

2021-04-13 17:26:04,wallstreetbets,"yeah i get the dev tools way, but i could fake any position. wondering why this one in particular had people suspicious and it turns out it's because of that particular brokerage's (webull) ui, which i wasn't familiar with.

op has since provided proof. our overlord /u/zjz had an interesting proposition to brokerages, where they should allow users to share their via a direct link a position that they wish to make public‚Äîlike when you purchase something from amazon, for example. don't see it happening any time soon, but hopefully in the not too distant future"
2021-04-13 16:59:38,wallstreetbets,Added picture in my profile of profits and loss. Apologies for not putting it in the original
2021-04-13 14:27:22,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. I have tried to explain this to numerous people numerous times...they don't get it and don't want to get it. A company cannot recall it's shares, and the chaos that would ensue if they could would be disastrous. However, as stated in the op, brokers that have lent shares can recall those lent shares. GME can't force them to do they...they can only ask that they do it."

Take a look at the announcement that Gme is paying off all debt allowing them to do a merger or something like this which would in turn force the hand to call back shares. I.e. Cohen may not give them a choice, and can you blame him? They wanted to bury the company."

Noting will happen to you or the position. It is scary but learning is best when with experience!"
2021-04-13 17:31:45,wallstreetbets,Exposure of that brokerage through social media probably has nothing but upside for said brokerage.
2021-04-13 14:58:17,wallstreetbets,"You implied GME was doing it when you said ""GME is recalling shares"". That's not the same as ""GME is (really hoping that institutional investors start) recalling shares"". They have nothing to do with it other than kindly asking."
2021-04-13 17:50:06,wallstreetbets,"Sure if someone bought gamestop that might be a problem, but certainly that's not happening with their stock price at what its at right now, or if it did happen gamestop would agree to a double digit share price in the deal.

Zero chance. I don't even think you could convince an MA student gamestop was a good buy right now.

Next step I bet is share dilution, that's Cohen's best move to keep this thing going. But not so good for you guys :) 

Besides, from the looks of things, most short positions are in the 200+ range, anyone single digit was closed our during the 480 runup. They'll have plenty of chances to exit if there's a potential merger with only a 15% SI"

2021-04-13 18:02:17,wallstreetbets,"Si at 15% is fake. Look at the sec notice in 2013 about how short interest is hidden in the options market through married puts and deep itm calls. Then look at how many deep itm calls were bought over the past month. Now look at how many were bought this past week or so. Why are they not doing it anymore? Because of the dtc rule preventing it that was out in place 2 weeks ago. Now look at the other dtc rules coming out and you can start to see the bigger picture at work here. Your comment is missing the forest for the trees and it‚Äôs exactly what you are supposed to see, but if any of the so called MA‚Äôs dug any deeper they would see what I see üòâ

2021-04-13 18:15:27,wallstreetbets,"I did. 

The proof I mentioned isn't regarding last year, it's what you said of having talked to them and they won't recall institutional shares this year. If you have proof of that, not that it would change much though, please post on GME related subs. Counter DD and insights are welcomed if you frame it neutrally."
2021-04-13 18:16:30,wallstreetbets,"Not discounting this in the slightest. I believe it was more advantageous for them to continue to reap profits from lent out shares last year. I‚Äôm not sure that is the case this year though, and again the hand can be forced so they may not have a choice!"
2021-04-13 18:21:53,wallstreetbets,"I cant tape a phone conversation I had with my brokers risk desk, that's probably illegal. 

But from the sounds of it, you guys probably have one or two people long on GME who use Fidelity as their broker.

Here's a thought, call their risk desk, they're your broker after all.   
Ask them if they will be recalling institutional shares (shares fidelity owns in funds etc) and forcing closed their customers short positions."
2021-04-13 18:27:55,wallstreetbets,"They're not my broker and I'm not that interested in the answer

I only remark at how much energy and time you seem to spend on anti-GME narrative and it's always some sort of speculation without palpable proof, again confirmed this time

2021-04-13 19:51:57,wallstreetbets,"I did not have to read it all to see that you are smart, so allow me to challenge your singular focus on oil as a commodity versus oil as a precious commodity.

Do you know what happens when oil is reduced in price, but the end point sale price is increased? Yes, the profit margin is higher.

1. Moving oil is expensive, and environmental cleanup is more expensive. Reducing volume is a major cost saving that increases profit margin.
2. Pollution reduction is at the heart of ""climate change"" laws, so it is not simply about heat conductive gasses in the atmosphere. Reduced shipping volume also reduces potential incidents of environmental damage, which makes politicians happy.
3. Profit from oil at the end point of sale (for instance, at gas stations) benefits economies that do not profit from resource extraction from natural sources. This equates to profits sharing with the world proportional to usage.

The likely scenario for the future is that oil producers will become more like public utilities with their profits coming from profit sharing of value adding producers, like refiners of gasoline, plastics, cosmetics, petroleum jelly, and etcetera. Various deals or cross investments will establish this. Consequently, inflation tied to the broad use of oil is diminished almost entirely, since oil can reach rock bottom price without disturbing profitability of oil based products. Subsequently, governments benefit greatest from the increased tax options in the varied industries oil touches. Vehicle fuel can be allowed to inflate exorbitantly to encourage a shift to electric vehicles while still allowing oil energy plants to share the burden with coal as a low cost energy commodity until other energy sources take over.

Listen, high oil cost creates a potential for damage to economies during the transition between energy sources in addition to prohibiting expansion to businesses and jobs. Governments cannot allow high oil prices, because the will to maintain high value natural resources would cause oil to resist transition from pricing alone. Oil *must* be artificially reduced in price to facilitate political promises, so it will. There is no other way. Thus, the pragmatic investor would be wary of investment theories that rely on high oil prices.

I realize that many billions in individuals' wealth has been stuffed into traditional energy resources, but it is their choice to go down with the ship. To me, it is not a sign of future strength. To me, it is a sign of a dying past. Those investments will be lost when no new investors free their positions. It's just the way it is. Old people who cannot let go of the past.

I see the future, and run to it."

Doesn't FIFO adjust the cost basis based on wash sale rules? Like if I made $250,000 in realized gains and then lost $225,000 the next day I'll only owe taxes on $25,000 at the end of the year, right?

EDIT: my CPA said that since none of these gains were carried over the fiscal year, the losses are counted against the cost basis before capital gains taxes are calculated. He advised me to liquidate all of my day-traded positions in October/November if I could to retain my adjusted cost basis and only owe a percentage of the adj. gain in taxes.

Thanks for the heart attack, guys."
2021-04-13 12:58:46,wallstreetbets,It doesn't really matter as long as he closes the positions before the end of the year and doesn't re-enter them in January 2022. Kind of a weird thing to worry about in April.

2021-04-13 13:01:47,wallstreetbets,"This subreddit recently found out about wash sales and is tripping about them, most of the time for no reason.

All you really need to know is you should realize losses you want to realize in December, and do NOT re-buy the items sold at a loss for 30 days (in January, if that's easier).

What you want to avoid is a wash sale moving your loss from tax year 2021 to 2022. Not really something to worry about in April."
2021-04-13 12:54:18,wallstreetbets,"Same year cancels out as long as the losses are not on securities that are then purchased again within 30 days.

So, if you bought and then sold company X for a 1k loss. But then got back into company X within 30 days and it jumped significantly and sold for a 2k profit. You would not be at a capital gains of $0, it would be 2k. So, even though you actually only realized 1k, you would be taxed as though you realized 2k.

So it really become a problem if you are day trading the same securities all the time and taking both profits and losses on them. Theoretically you could make $0 in realized gains, but actually owe taxes on thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars."

2021-04-13 13:32:07,wallstreetbets,"Just spoke with my CPA and TDAmeritrade and they basically said I don't have to change my name and move to mexico.

You're correct, and I can tell how much bad information there is passed around here with people not understanding that the adjusted cost basis is an aggregated loss that is subtracted from any gains in the same year.

For the tards in the back: if you make +$50,000 on December 31st 2020, and then lose it all on January 1st 2021, you're going to have to cough up uncle sam's cut of the 50k for the 2020 taxes. Then you can either count the ""new"" loss against stock gambling gains that year, or count up to $3k against income taxes at the end of 2021.

###just sell everything in October and don't trade until January the next year."
2021-04-13 13:22:13,wallstreetbets,"> What you want to avoid is a wash sale moving your loss from tax year 2021 to 2022. Not really something to worry about in April.

Because then you'll owe taxes on a potential profit in 2021 even if 2022 shows you actually broke even (example)?"

2021-04-13 13:34:28,wallstreetbets,"You can just sell everything in December and not trade until February, too. Or to be super safe, just don't trade in December. Again, the only way to really fuck yourself in this manner is to sell for a loss in December then buy the same position back in January."
2021-04-13 19:38:23,wallstreetbets,"Adding to this, not all brokers are great with calculating wash sales. Both TDA and Robinhood hit me for some tickers I stopped trading in July/sept. 

You might have to do some math and adjust yourself."
2021-04-13 15:44:19,wallstreetbets,"So just to confirm, they said no need to worry about wash sales over quarterly payments, only for end of year, correct?"
2021-04-13 13:28:46,wallstreetbets,"Potentially. Basically if you make 100k on one position, but lose 90k on another you'd have 10k in taxable gains. If you made a wash sale that pushed that 90k loss to January you'd get taxed on 100k.

That 90k loss only gets rescheduled to next year so you don't *lose* it. But generally deferring taxes paid as long as legally possible is the best thing you can do. Those taxes on 90k worth of income could be invested and grow over a year so in that sense it is a financial loss.

It helps to look at wash sales as ""rescheduling loss"" versus ""cancelling loss"" if that makes sense. You don't want to reschedule a loss to a later tax year."
2021-04-13 17:01:20,wallstreetbets,"If the position is negative and you want to take the loss, basically yes. If it is positive you may or may not want to realize the gains."
2021-04-13 16:26:07,wallstreetbets,"I can be Bill and you can be Melinda, except male and gay."
2021-04-13 18:21:24,wallstreetbets,"Those are short term gains so they are taxed as regular income (30% is probably a decent estimate pending how much you make annually). But yeah you have the right idea.  There‚Äôs a bit more nuance to it and I‚Äôm not an expert by any means but that‚Äôs what I would plan on paying. 

Why not just pay the roughly $20k before April 15 and not worry about having a huge tax bill at the end of the year?"
2021-04-13 13:39:19,wallstreetbets,That's essentially what my CPA said. He said that I should just focus on reconciling everything at the end of the year to no current holdings and I should be fine just paying my dues on the $60k.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DKNG vs. PLTR - Why I like them both I am going to make this DD brief. DKNG and PLTR are considered two leaders in their categories. I hold positions in both but I like DKNG better because I think it will continue to grow as the TAM grows. Millenials are going to push this stock higher over the next decade.

What I love about DKNG:

* Insane Growth, Extremely healthy Gross Margins
* TAM is growing faster than ever- expected to increase to 45B in a few years
* Healthy cash balance
* Price to sales is decreasing drastically as a result of huge top line growth
* tons of opportunities for expansion
* Forward facing consumer company, with more than 30 states that could become available to DKNG. 
* Cathy loves it
* Guidance was increased to 5-7B from 3-5B

What I love about PLTR

* Insane gross margins of near 80%
* Moaty business with lots of contracts related to covid and the defense industry
* Tons of opportunities for expansion
* Potential opportunity for mammoth contracts that come out of nowhere.
* Cathy Loves it

What I don't like about PLTR

* PLTR leadership is known to be conservative- Biden is in the white house so maybe more controversy.
* Their Price to sales isn't decreasing as fast as DKNG
* Guidance was so so.

What I don't love about DKNG

* Not profitable yet but expected to be soon.
* I don't like the competition from fan duel as well as PENN
* Economy opening is bullish for sports gambling but bearish for online gambling
* Heavily regulated industry but showing approvals in multiple states

They made a really prudent decision early on to acquire all of their service providers so they‚Äôll never get fucked by some contract that expires 5 years down the road. Can‚Äôt say the same about PENN. That being said, no one has ever been able to concisely explain to me exactly what PLTR does. Despite being very technically literate, it took me dozens of hours of research to understand their value. I know that puts me in the minority of the PLTR investor pool and I‚Äôm For that reason, I‚Äôm out."

You came here to rub it in like some over privileged douche bag? Or because you give a fuck about other people in this forum? If ya let me borrow $5 I‚Äôd put my money on you being a douche.

2021-04-13 18:51:38,wallstreetbets,"This seems like some fake nonsense. Almost 1M in robinhood buying power, yet only 4k invested, turns into 400k in one day. Color me skeptical"

huge potential upside, but i don't recommend it to anyone who doesn't know the industry"
2021-04-13 13:49:00,wallstreetbets,"Same here. I always get burned because I read that some company has promising clinical trial results so I buy in, then the company issues a crap ton of new shares and dilutes me to pennies on the dollar. Now I just don't touch them."

When one blows up that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm doing some shady shit, just means I finally got lucky"
2021-04-13 19:42:17,wallstreetbets,20% OTM is low for biotech. They live and die by their results and as long as results are being announced and you're gonna play it you might as well go 20 to 40% OTM for the gains.
2021-04-13 13:37:03,wallstreetbets,"I was taking a look at this earlier and thought, wow, I wonder how many lucky bastards purchased those 10000% gain options.

2021-04-13 15:01:22,wallstreetbets,"buying puts after a run up is the worst thing you can do. IV crush eats all gains. Going long any type of option is only smart when IV is low otherwise you are literally swimming against the tide.

smart money would be selling call premium right now"

OP bought 77 contracts, which is 7,700 shares at 150$ per share. Then OP sold it 7,700 shares at 200$.  

Do the math- 200-150= 50 $ profit per share. He has 7,700 shares. 7,700* 50= 400,000$"
2021-04-13 15:13:13,wallstreetbets,He paid for a contract that allows him to buy the shares at $58 regardless of what the current price is.

2021-04-13 16:14:09,wallstreetbets,"Especially since these things can sometimes be 2-3 day gap ups (or gap right the fuck back down).

Initial gap up -> settles for the day -> another gap up from renewed interest once they do due diligence.

I've been hurt a few times selling after a 30-40% gap up, only to see a 50%+ gap up the day after. But I've also seen it drop back just as quickly.

These things become unhinged, and some people are into that."

2021-04-13 11:29:38,wallstreetbets,I still hold a little AMD. Past 3 months has been all over the place due to supply shortage. So I've been buying TSM in hope
2021-04-13 11:50:44,wallstreetbets,What's the catalyst?
2021-04-13 11:35:12,wallstreetbets,"Of AMD, INTC, and NVDA, I am hoping for AMD the most.

However, despite months of good news for AMD, INTC and NVDA have gone up in price while AMD has fallen. Of course, INTC and NVDA have had a mix of news themselves.

Either that means AMD is a buy opportunity, INTC and NVDA are overbought by comparison and should be lower than they are, or AMD is a lost cause.

But if AMD can't hold a price level above 80 after releasing Milan CPUs (spoiler: it didn't), I don't know what it will take. I've been rooting for them since $8 (long before I started playing the market) and maybe their share price has simply grown too fast to keep going.

So I'm definitely cheering you on, but I wouldn't do the same thing with my money."
2021-04-13 11:15:37,wallstreetbets,Gonna buy Intel.
2021-04-13 11:40:35,wallstreetbets,No contracts?

Also, this is far from the most retarded set of positions on here. You could be way more 'tard than this.

2021-04-13 14:24:12,wallstreetbets,"I give you a better than average chance based on the KHC positions. 

Most on here get into positions with a 99% chance of total ruin and 1% chance of infinite gains. You're somewhere around 50% chance of ruin and 50% chance of nice gainz. Just based on this ape's opinion."
2021-04-13 11:39:36,wallstreetbets,It's technically not it's ATH. If you look at 2017 it was almost at $100. Heinz and Kraft had a merger that screwed up their books. It's a 52 week high

\*EDIT: This was the my original DD post on VIAC, pre-hedgy collapse. I am still VERY BULLISH on the stock, and recent events have opened a new opportunity for those who felt they missed the VIAC rocket to get on. The rocket has come back for you retards! Are you getting on this time, or will you stay and watch from afar like before?

üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

\-Also, my price targets have not changed, but I do think the timing needs to be readjusted, but hey who knows what the future entails? Stranger things have happened....I just really like the stock!

That being said, welcome fellow retards, autists, apes and degenerates! There has been much DD already surrounding VIAC but I will repost all the links for you guys to read up on as we go along so you dont have to search for it on reddit. With the current battle going with GME, AMC and the hedgies, this ticker was easily overlooked.

VIAC has many things going for it, so excuse me if this shit seems all over the place. the more you read and understand, then the more you may agree that VIAC is a good investment.

Now lets talk about the GIANT that is ViacomCBS.

ViacomCBS comprises four major units:

* CBS Entertainment Group consists of CBS-branded assets, including the CBS television network, CBS News, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, CBS Media Ventures, Big Ticket Television, CBS Television Stations, and CBS Interactive. The unit also has a 50% interest in The CW television network joint venture co-owned by AT&T subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. division.\[47\]
* Domestic Media Networks encompasses the pay television channels owned byViacomCBS in the United States, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, BET, Comedy Central, TV Land, Paramount Network, Logo, CMT, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, VH1, The Movie Channel, and Flix. ViacomCBS Domestic also controls production facilities for the channels listed above, including Nickelodeon Animation Studio.
* International Networks encompasses certain international versions of the company's domestic channels, as well as region-specific networks, such as Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, Network 10 in Australia, and Telefe in Argentina. ViacomCBS International also owns a third\[48\] of the Rainbow S.r.l. television studio in Italy, as well as a 49% stake in the Viacom 18 joint venture with TV18.\[49\] This unit also includes all CBS-branded channels across Europe, which are co-owned with AMC Networks International.
* Global Distribution Group focuses on the global distribution of all programs produced by all ViacomCBS production studios. The division consists of ViacomCBS International Studios.

Other assets owned by ViacomCBS include the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, the company's flagship subscription streaming service Paramount+, over-the-top ad-supported video-on-demand platform Pluto TV, book publisher Simon & Schuster, multi-genre online video conference VidCon, mixed martial arts promoter Bellator, and media and entertainment company AwesomenessTV. As of November 2019, AwesomenessTV is overseen by its co-founder Brian Robbins, an executive for ViacomCBS Domestic. The company also has an undisclosed stake in FuboTV, acquired in 2020.

See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViacomCBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViacomCBS)

For a list of all assets owned by ViacomCBS: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_assets\_owned\_by\_ViacomCBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_ViacomCBS)

Viacom's audience reach is very broad, as their content is vast and appeals to all kinds of demographics. Let's talk about just Paramount Plus alone for. I know a bunch of fucktards didnt like the release of P+ but its not about just yourself, its about the potential appeal to other people who have likes and dislikes that differ from yourself.

P+ not only has a ton of content but also LIVE FUCKING SPORTS!!!!! Here's a look at the more than 1,000 live games P+ is bringing to the table:

* THE NFL ON CBS
* The Masters
* NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship
* PGA TOUR
* SEC ON CBS
* The PGA Championship
* National Women's Soccer League
* UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League --¬†*Paramount+ is the only place in the U.S. where soccer fans can find exclusive English-language coverage of every UEFA club competition match, every season.*

In addition, Paramount+ is expanding its exclusive English-language rights in the U.S. with three more soccer properties, featuring hundreds of additional matches.

* Concacaf -- offering more than 200 Concacaf matches, starting with the Concacaf Nations League Finals in June of this year, which will feature the U.S. Men's National Team. Coverage will feature all 41 national teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean across different competitions, including the qualifiers for the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023, which will feature the defending champion U.S. Women's National Team.
* Liga Profesional de Futbol -- Paramount+ will stream more than 300 matches a year from Argentina's top soccer division.
* Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A -- Paramount+ will stream more than 360 matches a year from Brazil's premier soccer league.

The service will also be the exclusive home of a long-running, original series¬†***Inside the NFL***. And knowing fans don't stop watching when the players stop playing, Paramount+ will feature CBS Sports HQ.

This is a no brainer. Sports brings in YUUUUUGE revenue and viewership and P+ will have many different kinds of sports that appeal to all kinds of viewers across the globe. Soccer is literally the most popular and watched sport in the world. Honestly from the sports side, all P+ is missing is Cricket. March Madness alone has broken revenue records and the month isn't even over!!!!! Even if corona were to shut it down, VIAC has already gotten more profit than they anticipated, any additional profit are just more blessings!

P+ will also have a bunch of original content coming in the next coming years. Here you can find a list of content coming to P+. [https://deadline.com/2021/02/paramount-programming-tv-series-films-streaming-viacomcbs-1234700647/](https://deadline.com/2021/02/paramount-programming-tv-series-films-streaming-viacomcbs-1234700647/)

The one that caught my interest the most was Halo. I remember I bought the Xbox console SOLEY for that game alone, along with millions of other fans. I suspect this alone would bring a lot of attention when released to P+.

ViacomCBS also has A LOT of their content licensed out to other companies such as Amazon and Netflix. ""Coming to America 2"" was made by Paramount Studios yet is streaming on Amazon. Why? Because of the shit ton of revenue it brings them.

""When Disney began developing Disney+, it reclaimed every last piece of programming it had licensed to Netflix (though Disney films released between Jan. 2016 and Dec. 2018 may return to Netflix in 2026). In doing so, the Mouse House sacrificed hundreds of millions of dollars in lucrative licensing revenue in order to build an exclusive in-house library. Yet Paramount Pictures spent 2020 selling off most of its theatrical features to rival streamers while Paramount Network licensed cable‚Äôs biggest hit (Yellowstone) exclusively to Peacock. Why? Because ViacomCBS President & CEO of Streaming Tom Ryan believes strategic licensing can be a boom for Paramount+ long-term even if it costs the streamer exclusive access."" See: [https://observer.com/2021/03/paramount-plus-icarly-netflix-viacomcbs-licensing/](https://observer.com/2021/03/paramount-plus-icarly-netflix-viacomcbs-licensing/)

Netflix has gotten significant attention for its massive spending on content. Over the last year, the company's spending on content topped $14.6 billion. ViacomCBS suggested it spent about $13 billion last year on content. It's no secret that spending on content seems to drive streaming revenue. However, some are speculating the company's recently announced $2.5 billion debt offering could be an act of desperation. There is little doubt that the coronavirus pandemic represents a significant challenge, yet ViacomCBS seems to be positioned better than some of its peers.

For those worried about closed movie theaters, last quarter the company's theatrical revenue equaled just under 2% of total revenue. It's true that advertising makes up the bulk of the company's revenue, yet the company's consistent high-quality content should continue to attract ad dollars. When people are stuck at home, it's likely they are going to watch more video. Whether that means Pluto TV, the traditional CBS, Showtime, or CBS All Access, the company should be able to grow its audience. As the public health crisis eventually fades, the returning ad dollars, combined with a bigger audience, should serve investors and the company well.

As proof that streaming seems to be the future of ViacomCBS, the company's subscription and video advertising business is expected to grow by 35% to 40%. ViacomCBS has multiple offerings driving its streaming business. The company's Pluto TV service increased its monthly active users in the U.S. by 75% annually. Paid streaming subscriptions increased by 50% year over year domestically. On the flip side, Netflix is witnessing a split in its membership growth. On the domestic side of the house, Netflix's paid memberships increased by a pedestrian 4.4% annually. International has become the company's growth engine, with paid memberships increasing by more than 31% year over year.

Though both ViacomCBS and Netflix are reporting solid growth in subscribers, the former generates significant free cash flow. In the past 12 months, ViacomCBS generated core free cash flow (FCF) of over $3.4 billion.

The coronavirus may challenge ViacomCBS' short-term results and cause volatility. However, with a yield of nearly 6%¬†an almost comically low payout ratio, and a growing streaming business, this represents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors.

Don't forget Netflix is also cracking down on password sharing. As far as I know, P+ can be shared and streamed on multiple devices at once. I am always streaming my P+ on my computer 24/7 and can watch a soccer match from my mobile device at the same time. Also, P+ doesn't ask me if I am ""still watching"" like Netflix does after some time.

ViacomCBS also owns Paramount Pictures, a movie studio that has produced so much great content over the years. Last time I checked, movie theaters are PACKED and movie revenue will continue to explode as we get closer to the summer and as we get more people vaccinated.

Another interesting thing regarding ViacomCBS is that is currently trading with a P/E ratio of 24.22, much lower than Netflix(85.21), yet Netflix doesn't offer live sports or news and does not generate cable revenue. ViacomCBS is still undervalued and has a lot of room for growth. As of now, the public float of shares is around 543 million shares, while the amount of shares shorted on VIAC is about 19.36% (around 105 million shares). Along with that, there is high institutional ownership of shares (currently 93.86%, see: [https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VIAC&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VIAC&subView=institutional)) and is very possible that an there potential an activist investor has been buying up shares since August of last year. (see:[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/viacomcbs-surges-on-bet-that-an-activist-investor-will-emerge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/viacomcbs-surges-on-bet-that-an-activist-investor-will-emerge))

Institutional money has some of the BIGGEST diamond hands ever and they are seemingly continuing to buy up shares and hold, another reason you continue to see VIAC have a strong, daily uptrend. With such high institutional ownership and very low insider ownership (0.2% of total float), that leaves about 6% of shares left available (543 million shares).

see:[http://www.stocksequity.com/active-stocks/traders-should-take-notice-on-viacomcbs-inc-nasdaqviac-with-the-stream-of-3-26/](http://www.stocksequity.com/active-stocks/traders-should-take-notice-on-viacomcbs-inc-nasdaqviac-with-the-stream-of-3-26/)

Viacom operates a largely decentralized business model. It gets almost 80% of its revenues through a collection of network channels that include MTV, MTV2, VH1, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, TV Land, CMT, BET, and Spike. The rest of its revenues come from Paramount Pictures (film) and Harmonix (video games).

Those subsidiaries have their own management teams that are silo-ed off to act in their own self interest. Even when Sumner Redstone was in his physical prime and applied a micro-managing spirit to his holdings, he wasn‚Äôt make individual business decisions‚Äìhe was firing the managers of his subsidiaries for not meeting his short-term expectations. This isn‚Äôt Steve Jobs orchestrating the iPhone; Sumner Redstone did not bring you SpongeBob.

While most Viacom shareholders are understandably paying attention to the public spat over board control, that is not the issue that would keep me up at night if I were a long-term shareholder. Considering that 80% of revenues come from network channels, my predominant focus would be: How many minutes are being delivered per month by the channels we own?

We‚Äôve had four nasty recessions in the past century. These are illustrative for helping us figure out the durability of a company‚Äôs profits during times of deep distress and aid us in quantifying the harm posed by perceived risks. In the case of Viacom, it actually grew profits from $2.38 per share in 2008 to $2.56 per share in 2009. Profits went from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion even as minutes distributed through the network channels declined by 5%. Advertising rates plummeted, and minutes watched declined by a little bit, and yet the media giant still churned out more cash.

Viacom keeps its dividends in the low 30% payout ratio territory so that it can repurchase gobs of stock and boost earnings. It has repurchased 35% of its stock since 2010, taking the share count down from 608 million to 390 million. Viacom is one of the best companies lately when it comes to getting serious about reducing its share count.

Viacom is one of the best companies lately when it comes to getting serious about reducing its share count.

Profits have declined $200 million from $2.2 billion to $2.0 billion over the past five years. That also coincides with a significant period of buybacks so that earnings have actually grown from $3.78 per share in 2011 to somewhere in the low $5 range right now.

Put another way: Viacom the corporation has seen profits decline by 1.89% per year over the last five years, while Viacom shareholders have seen their profits climb by 6.17% per year over the past five years.

Edit: good read and news, more income for VIAC - [https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bellator-tv-rights-showtime-us-viacomcbs](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bellator-tv-rights-showtime-us-viacomcbs)

The Play:

I believe VIAC will see $175 or higher by EOY. I already have several calls at different strikes, but I plan on getting many more far OTM calls with 2023 expirations and plan on getting more shares. I believe anything after 4/16 expiration with $90-120 strikes would be a good call to look at.

üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

\*EDIT: Although I still believe $175 EOY is possible, I think $150 is more likely and conservative. I can very much so see this stock at $200 in 2022. I have already gotten OTM LEAPS and will hold on to them like your wife holds her boyfriend at night. For shorter term calls, I would look at $52-$60 calls with at least 2-3 months to expiration, obviously more time is better. This week will be important, if the sell momentum has died down, the only other direction this stock can go is: UP!

üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

Also I am anticipating YUGE sub growth in this year and next. Even if you hate their streaming service, I'm willing to be that you have watched at least 1 VIAC produced show or movie on any of the other stream services you do like and subscribe to. They are going to make money either from you directly subscribing or you watching their content on other services....\*cough\*coming to america 2\*cough\*....

üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

I can imagine a scenario where others who like the stock also like and support the stream with a sub, and unlike other services like Netflix that stops streaming after some time asking you ""are you still watching"", Paramount Plus doesn't. I mean hey, I LOVE VIAC and I LOVE P+ so much that I just  
üëÅÔ∏èwatchüëÅÔ∏è shows 24/7. I would love to üëÅÔ∏èwatchüëÅÔ∏è all their content, although I do fall asleep at sometimes, but the shows and movies keep playing, so I NEVER MISS OUT. Even while at work, on my other computer I leave the shows üëÅÔ∏èplayingüëÅÔ∏è so I NEVER MISS ANYTHING. Could you imagine others loving the stock and company like I do, üëÅÔ∏èwatchingüëÅÔ∏è all their content NONSTOP? I could only imagine their upcoming üëÅÔ∏èearnings reportüëÅÔ∏è would be insane in that case, and would do wonders to my lovely stock... but again, I'm retarded so what the hell do I know right?

üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

If you know, you know.... üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

Now I also believe there may be a great opportunity here for those who has been hurt or downed in the battle of GME and AMC, and there has been MANY. Look to VIAC as the healing spell that has been cast on the market. VIAC can rejuvenate your tendies, so you can have more ammo to fight against the hedgies! Should you choose let VIAC heal you, I suggest you leave some tendies with VIAC to continue to grow and multiply, just in case if you go back and goto the GME or AMC fight and get hurt or down in battle once again. That way you can return to the VIAC tendies you had left and didnt touch, which have now created tendie clones that you can use once again in the GME and AMC battle, should you choose to do so! For the battle of GME and AMC will be long and drawn out, you must be adequately prepared!!! TENDIES MAKES MORE TENDIES!!!!

VIAC is the water of life, it heals all those who are weary from battle! Use this power wisely, fellow retards, autists, apes and degenerates!

I know it's not going to drop much from where it currently sits, but I am expecting it to stay flat for a while until we see some big catalysts."

2021-04-13 12:10:37,wallstreetbets,"Only positive that I can see is their sport offering. Rest is mediocre.

The TV stations they own across the world are second/third tier apart from their kids channels.

They've really struggled with box office movies. Having a major film go straight to streaming is TERRIBLE. They did have strong success with Sonic, A Quiet Place was really strong a 3 years ago, Rocketman was good too, and they have mission Impossible movies keeping them going, but you will rarely see them competing for any Oscars. Big box office hits to watch out for are snake eyes and Tomorrow something (I forgot the name), but still nothing really exciting. Disney, Fox (now owned by Disney), Warner, Sony pictures/Columbia have all had greater success over the last few years and looking at Paramount's direction I can't see that changing (Paramount loves a good sequel over anything original).

Your price targets are laughable - yeah it might grow by a few percentages this year (not much though, if it closes this year at over 50 I'd be surprised), but a p/e of over 20 is quite high already for what they produce, comparing it to Netflix is dumb. Netflix is already overvalued but at least they've shown to be innovators in the past. 

Best of luck with this, but you're portraying a typical boomer stock as something exciting, which it isn't really..."

2021-04-13 12:25:44,wallstreetbets,"TV stations are second tier? Idk about global but CBS routinely has the highest ratings among network tv.  Current p/e is around 10 right now. I think 20 would be the high-water mark in my opinion, but that would suggest a market value of $80/share. I think 150 is a super aggressive and highly unlikely bar some huge P+ signup shenanigans.

Disney loves sequels too. We have seen that leveraging existing IP is pretty powerful. However, I agree that is their weakest arm. That being said, I don't think Oscar contention is the biggest thing as everyone seems to just buy highly rated Indie flicks to get prestige these days. With their 8B in cash on hand they can compete in this realm quickly if needed.

As I said, I agree with some of your points and think this DD is out there (like nearly every DD on this sub).  However, I think 60 for short term is a reasonable target and 80 EOY is not crazy (100 possible but that would take a massive beat an the announcement of some exciting new streaming only series, along with some good movie acquisitions).

2021-04-13 11:17:29,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. Thank you for the info. I've been eyeing VIAC and might do a bit more research on my own before jumping in.
2021-04-13 14:12:57,wallstreetbets,"You're right for CBS in USA it's the highest for total ratings. To be fair I don't work in the US so I didn't know, but in Europe, LATAM, Oceania, Viacom channels are tier 2/tier 3 at best (apart from kids, where it's top tier with turner and disney). To note, most tier 1 channels only operate in one country, so I wouldn't be too upset by it. Also looking at total ratings doesn't tell the whole story - ratings on Adults 18-49 are much more valuable than older ones, and channels that skew towards Men also deliver higher ad revenue.

~~Current P/E is 10 if you look at Yahoo Finance, if you look at ViacomCBS and look at their actual figures, it's over 20 ($3.93 EPS). Yahoo Finance is great for an overview, but you need to do your due diligence over that by looking at the company's results that they report.~~ I'm so fucking dumb, you're right P/E is close to 10. I guess I forgot how to divide 40/3.93...

Yes, but Disney has a pedigree of delivering excellent films that people go to see. Looking at their finances, Box Office isn't a main revenue driver anyway so it's fair to say you can ignore it. However if they start building strong franchises, then who knows, Viacom might be a strong investment, but looking at what they have coming in this year, it won't be soon. Oscar winning films tend to be part of the $100M club, maybe not the same as the $1B club Avengers is in, but still very strong. Paramount might get 1 film a year in that bracket, could be a couple this year if you consider Mission Impossible a shoe-in to reach that, and then you hope for the best that one of their other big blockbusters is a success.

Re 8B in cash, sure that's strong. 10B total if you count receivables (3B in actual cash). Still 8B in current liabilities, but I am surprised to see such a strong balance sheet vs 2019, I thought with how media was impacted this year it would be worse, but it's significantly better. Fair play.

60 is a good target, but don't be surprise if it doesn't get there this year or even the next 3 years. It's a stock that is really safe and tends to trade flat as it doesn't really see any significant increase in net revenue.

As you said, I'd much rather have these discussions on this sub than the echo chamber we've seen on some other stocks. I won't be touching this as I like a bit of risk in my investments (stocks with an opportunity to be a double bagger in a year, if not more. I say that but I do own Sony, so take whatever I say with a pinch of salt). Overall I like Viacom as I used to be one of their vendors in one of their segments, but for me, it's got a long way to go before it grows substantially to be an even bigger media conglomerate.

Also would be interesting to compare the financials vs Disney, but then again In this sector it's hard as you're never comparing apples with apples, like you don't buy AT&T because it owns Warner or Sony because it owns SPE/SPT/SPHE, it's only part of it."

You just backed up my claim with the EPS. You have to remember that the historical number of 20 was when the stock was flying high. P/E is a dynamic number and saying it is 20 after a drop by 50% in stock price is just wrong. It was 20 when they released their financials, but now it is 10, which is why I say it is undervalued.  I can't believe your confidence when being wrong."

For what it is worth, I think you are ignoring kids movies (sponge bob, paw patrol, etc) for major box office success (not to mention that it is unclear if that is even going to be a good measure, just going off the Netflix model with movies like Roma). 

You bring up some good points that I don't disagree with, but I think their back catalog and sports, combined with children's programming will drive robust P+ signups will push the value to 80-100/share where the stagnation you point out will become an issue."
2021-04-13 14:50:09,wallstreetbets,"Fair point on kids movies. Streaming platforms seem very saturated to me right now. I think there have been loads of major additions in the last 2/3 years, with Disney +, Peacock, Apple TV, Britbox + whatever else is out there, but I guess it's hard to ignore it as you risk getting becoming irrelevant. Sports still remains a very competitive market with ESPN, Fubo, sport specific streaming services and Peacock (which reminds me I forgot to mention Universal in my Hollywood movie studios).

Best of luck with your investment!"

I have a friend that would be considered 2nd generation wealthy.  Retired early and managed his money well enough to live a luxurious life by most peoples' standards.  He will definitely have enough money to share with the kids to help with down payments for houses and such, but they are going to have to work lol.

His parents grew up extremely poor and started a very successful business that he and his brother helped manage.  He got out in his early 40s but kept the land the business was on.  Basically had a covered call on the land.  Rent for a minimum of 10 years with the option to buy at over market value after the 10 years are up.  I think the rent for the land was about $30k/month so he did alright.  

Only one of his kids seems to be focused on a 'work for assets until the assets work for you' mindset.  I don't think the others invest at all but I could be wrong."

Disclosure. long & strong on $PFE. Do your own DD but here is some of mine. Been in it since low 30s. Moves like a üêå 

It‚Äôs a solid company, 2021 is going to big catalyst due to C19 vaccine, low P/E. Upside potential is huge

Pfizer plans to produce 1B vaccines in 2021.  cost is roughly $10/vaccine. If they can make this happen it‚Äôll be 500M doses. Requires 2 doses. That could mean upwards of +10B in additional revenue including sales & all the govt funding. 

Pfizer getting approval for higher storage temp. This will ease burden on cold supply chain, improve supply and longer life. 

Pfizer is also working on supply chain improvements, moving things in-house to speed up production and control. 

Supply & Production only gets better with time. 

If they hit all targets, they should see +10B revenue increase. That‚Äôs +20% increase v 2020. High side they add +20B in rev this year"
2021-04-13 10:12:15,wallstreetbets,"Yerp. Bought LEAPS in the way back when I first heard they were working on vaccines. Sold the news. Converted profits to equity. Bought another LEAPS on the way down, slow and steady ride up, been running a PMCC, never through earnings. Premiums are low but consistent.

Its a good company. Profits arent going anywhere. Profits support dividend. Its about as boomer as boomer stonks come. 

Side note, of the available vaccines anecdotes are Pfizer has the least side effects. Thats the beat on the street. Vaccine is just fueling revenue and paying back development costs, no real profits."
2021-04-13 11:28:59,wallstreetbets,It's at 70 RSI rn though. At least wait before buying in if anybody is considering hopping in immediately.

2021-04-13 16:41:58,wallstreetbets,FD I own 100 shares but the revenue and profit bump from the vaccine is viewed as a one off. Not a source of long term recurring revenue and profit. That's why the stock continues to trade well below 40. They will have to turn this one trick pony (MRNA tech) into additional vaccines and treatments for other diseases.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Inflation impulse sets off precious metals, once they get going it can snowball quickly. Some advice for anyone looking to jump into Silver or Gold This is a quick DD just getting a few facts out there in case anyone searches WSB for gold or silver today in light of inflation picking up.

First, on the ‚ÄòCitadel owns SLV‚Äô line. SLV is garbage so it kind of makes sense. Secondly, citadel is a market maker. They are long and short pretty much every stock, so good luck avoiding anything they have their hands on. Thirdly, it‚Äôs a minuscule portion of their portfolio. Net long position likely less than 0.1% of their AUM.

The fed is likely to cap rates as they respond to to higher inflation.  They might not announce anything, but look at the size of their purchases when the data comes out.  In many ways they‚Äôve already begun YCC.

This means that as inflation expectations rise, real yields fall because nominal yields are capped.  This is extremely positive for gold and silver.

I prefer silver to gold because in a raging bull market for PMs, silver will greatly outperform gold.

Silver‚Äôs industrial and jewelry use is coming closer to eclipsing the annual production. You may not know that silver is used in solar panels, electric cars, and really anything that‚Äôs electronic and expensive. This is because it is the most conductive of all elements.  If you are bullish on green tech, silver is a natural play. As monetary demand comes in, it just doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to absorb it, which is why it can spike.

You may remember the silver squeeze movement that took off for about 3 days on WSB back in late January.  Barely anyone joined that train as virtually everyone was still playing GME (and still are, keep holding GME brothers) and yet it still had a fairly large impact.

The supply situation is far tighter today than it was 2.5 months ago, so people jumping in the silver train now will be far more impactful. 

Also, we‚Äôve learned that SLV is a scam, and silver surfers probably shot themselves in the face by buying it.

Here‚Äôs a very long DD that explains it. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv_is_a_complete_scam_its_a_scalp_trade_set_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Broken into 3 parts, that DD addresses SLV being a scam, the silver short squeeze, and the fundamental case for silver.

Essentially to properly buy silver through an ETF you need to buy PSLV, not SLV.

In the silver squeeze world there are many ways to play it,

PSLV is like buying shares, it directly contributes to the snowballing of the squeeze. It‚Äôs also highly marginable so you can get a leveraged pure play on the metal if you want

Miners are like call options on the metal, but also frequently mine other things than just silver and carry political risk and other types of risk, not a complete pure play, but some of them can be very close

There are also call options on miners. 

Most of the miners are too small in terms of market cap to post here unfortunately.

If you want more info go read the longer DD I posted in the link above!

PSLV, not SLV




Also:  PSLV was also banned on Robinhood a few months ago, so if you are still using that shitty broker please switch to one that won‚Äôt try to screw your at every turn"

2021-04-13 16:17:51,wallstreetbets,"If you invest in metals I highly suggest actually buying silver or gold coins instead of using paper/etf markets. 

1.  Some states like CA do not charge sales tax on purchases and sales above ~$1,000. This is huge.

2.  Metal coins have a collector‚Äôs value inherent to them. Keep them in their US mint packaging.

3. Don‚Äôt buy Chinese or other shady gold. 

4.  Buy from a local dealer. You can sell back to them later.

5.  Don‚Äôt put more than 10% of your portfolio in metals. They won‚Äôt beat the stonk market in the long term.  Don‚Äôt listen to nut jobs like Peter Schiff who is long gold like a squirrel is for acorns."
2021-04-13 14:57:05,wallstreetbets,Correction FYI gold is more conductive than silver. That's why the price of silver is not likely to exceed the price of gold as gold can be substituted for silver in electronic applications if the price justifies it. What is also likely is silver will be substituted for larger amounts of copper when applicable for some applications as prices rise. I personally don't think this will have a huge impact on the actual silver prices as the bull is unleashed but just want people here to stay realistic and not start touting outlandish ideas. Silver is still needed in some applications but once it reaches the same price as gold they will likely trade 1:1 for a while (months? years?) and eventually the supply and demand will equilibrate back to a more historic silver:gold ratio ( say 14:1)

On top of all that - it's not as limited in supply as people think, over entire human history we managed to mine only about 1% of Earth's gold - the only limiting factor for how much gold we can get is the price of gold itself (more incentives to do expensive extraction when the price is high).

2021-04-13 17:10:02,wallstreetbets,Real rates do not decline with higher inflation unless there is some sort of Fed intervention. To date the Fed has quietly begun to unwind their easy policies. They let the 10 year rise to over 1.7% from .9% without operation twist or any adjustment to bond purchases. They also let SLR expire which allowed rates to additionally increase in March. Bullard just said that the Fed may begin to debate tapering sooner rather than later. They are laying the ground work for higher long term interest rates along with higher inflation expectations. LT rates will move higher in step with inflation or even higher and your gold and silver will be crushed.

2021-04-13 10:15:02,wallstreetbets,"I've bought from two places - sdbullion with a dot com, and from some guy with a good rep called MilesFranklin with a dot com.  Miles you actually have to call to order from, which I actually enjoyed as he was happy to provide suggestions AND it isn't something that is as easy to trace (I dont' trust the gov much, so anything that makes it less likely they know what I do is good).  Investing in PSLV is a great second step, but almost everyone that follows silver suggests having somewhere between 5-15% of your monies in silver/gold.  silver looks like it has the best moonshot potential, with gold having a nice climb in potential, but not a moonshot (as far as % gain I mean).  
I would buy physical at whatever price I can get it at if I had none until I had at least 5%, then for the next 5% I would compare a few places. Right now, premiums can be high (meaning they say online that silver's $25 an ounce, but to buy it, you have to pay $25 + premium of $XX.XX over that price depending on the coin one is buying.  
The cheapest and cloest to spot is 'junk silver' which are typically old coinage with silver in it. widely recognized and reliable, but not as pretty, so smallest premium. I have a good bit of that, and the other half(ish) is in specific coins of varying designs based on what was available when I ordered.

For the record, if one goes with MilesFranklin, they'll match any price you can find anywhere else, so ask him for his recommendation and then check his price against something like sdbullion of the dot com and if his price isn't lower already, just say you see it there for XX.XX price and he'll almost certainly match it or beat by a small amount."

There's a lot of upside and the downside compared to stocks is minimal. Even if prices floor(2020 they hit $12/oz) Losing 60% of value is a substantially lower risk than any stock."
2021-04-13 10:48:50,wallstreetbets," I bought at AP MEX, using a certain electronic currency that I can't mention on this sub. Took about a month for them to finally ship, but the rate you pay locks in at buy time, not ship time. That could, of course, be either good or bad. 1kg bars are about $1000. They're about the size of a deck of cards. They're fun to have around. You can buy bigger bars, but I figured any larger and they'd be harder to sell when the time comes. I don't plan to sell mine for decades, though."

Any broker-dealer as an authorized participant can redeem baskets of shares on behalf of shareholders. You are  responsible for delivery expenses. Each basket is 500,000 ounces delivered in silver bars. If you want to take delivery from slv buy 500k shares from an authorized dealer broker and tell them where to delivery it to.

This is sprouts prospectus

""Redemption of Trust Units for Physical Silver Bullion 
Unitholders whose trust units are redeemed for physical silver bullion will be entitled to receive a redemption price 
equal to 100% of the NAV of the redeemed units on the last day of the month on which NYSE Arca is open for trading for 
the month in respect of which the redemption request is processed. Redemption requests must be for amounts that are at least 
equivalent to the value of ten London Good Delivery bars or an integral multiple of one bar in excess thereof, plus applicable 
expenses. A ‚ÄúLondon Good Delivery bar‚Äù weighs between 750 and 1,100 troy ounces (approximately 23 to 34 kilograms) 
and usually are approximately 1,000 troy ounces. Any fractional amount of redemption proceeds in excess of ten London 
Good Delivery bars or an integral multiple of one bar in excess thereof will be paid in cash at a rate equal to 100% of the 
NAV of such excess amount. The ability of a unitholder to redeem trust units for physical silver bullion may be limited by 
the sizes of London Good Delivery bars held by the Trust at the time of redemption. A unitholder redeeming units for 
physical silver bullion will be responsible for expenses in connection with effecting the redemption and applicable delivery 
expenses, including the handling of the notice of redemption, the delivery of the physical silver bullion for units that are 
being redeemed and the applicable fees charged by the Mint in connection with such redemption, including but not limited to 
silver storage redemption fees, pallet repackaging fees and administrative fees. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unitholders that are constituted and authorized as Undertakings for Collective 
Investments in Transferable Securities (‚ÄúUCITS‚Äù) or are otherwise prohibited by their investment policies, guidelines or 
restrictions from receiving physical silver bullion may only redeem trust units for cash. 
Since inception, 2,536,802 trust units have been redeemed for physical silver bullion. 
A unitholder that owns a sufficient number of units who desires to exercise redemption privileges for physical silver 
bullion must do so by instructing his, her or its broker, who must be a direct or indirect participant of CDS Clearing and 
Depository Services Inc. or The Depository Trust Company, to deliver to the Trust‚Äôs transfer agent, TSX Trust Company, on 
behalf of the unitholder a written notice (the ‚ÄúSilver Redemption Notice‚Äù) of the unitholder‚Äôs intention to redeem trust units ""

It's literally the same exact setup as SLV except PSLV allows you to redeem just 100oz instead of it having to be 500k ounces (for an additional 2% admin fee thou that slv doesn't have) PSLV is also more easily worded then SLV is.

I'm sorry for spazzing before. I'm bipolar so not stable im having trouble getting medication and was having a very bad episode earlier today and all these conspiracy theories I keep seeing are ruining this subreddit.

The silver squeeze is real for macro reasons. Whether you buy SLV or PSLV makes no difference they are the same thing."

# What is Delta Neutral?

Delta neutral is a portfolio strategy utilizing multiple positions with balancing¬†positive and negative [deltas](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp) so that the overall delta of the assets in question¬†totals zero.

I'm not going to explain what delta is in any level of depth. If you don't know what it is get the fuck out of this forum and go read on the internet. We often thing of delta as a rate of change in price of our option but it's anything but static.

Delta neutral is actually very simple. You sum all of your positions for a particular underlying. If it's 0 congrats you're delta neutral. Delta neutral is ideal but it's nearly impossible to maintain because price changes so often. If you're an MM that's fine you have billions at your disposal but most of us can't do that shit.

Simple example: You have a put with a delta of -.3 and you have 30 shares.

The short position

1 Put ( 100 \* -.3 = -30 Delta)

The long position

30 shares = (30 \* +1 = 30 Delta)

30Delta (long) + -30 Delta (short) => Delta Neutral (0)

Let's say the price goes down and now your put is now Delta = -.35 (gamma of -0.05)

Your short position has now created a delta negative position which means you disproportionately benefit if üìâ but you get rekt if üìà. To get your position back in balance you would need to acquire 5 shares.

New positions post price movement of $1

The short position

1 Put (100 \* -.35 = -35 Delta )

The long position

35 shares = (35 \* +1Delta = 35Delta)

Okay great... now do it every time the price changes a dollar up or down.

No surprise you can't keep doing this shit. This level of day trading isn't in the cards for most of us.

Why does delta change?

The closer an option is to ITM or further ITM the closer it will converge to 1:1 ratio of price change. I say converge because options can not have 0 or 1 delta. The fact that they have extrinsic value means it's impossible. Say you have a 1C on underlying that's 5000. You're $4999 ITM which means the intrinsic value of the option is going to nearly mirror the movement of the underlying price. If you have a 5000C on a call that's underlying $1. Congrats you wasted money and your delta is likely around .0001 or something stupid like that.

Let's look at it graphically since I know you fucking idiots don't like reading.

Gaze 'pon ye olde Delta chart for calls.

Obviously these are approximations but the key takeaway is that delta is asymptotic. That means it will never be 0 or 1, it will change rapidly around the middle and rapidly decelerate toward the ends. I feel like we covered this enough. I don't want to distract you retards from jerking off to only fans and watching that show you've seen for the 9th time through.

A final peak on an actual option chain so you can observe the curve.

[https://preview.redd.it/rqr62cq8ias61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcdc607de18253a85a0c5b83f05b73071c55bbe2](https://preview.redd.it/rqr62cq8ias61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcdc607de18253a85a0c5b83f05b73071c55bbe2)

You can see the proximity to price with respect to strike is what correlates to the delta. Delta is a function of difference between underlying price, strike price of position and gamma. That's an oversimplification but you don't want to see the math formulas do you?

Here's an example case I made to observe change in Delta over price change for a single long position.

[Don't be fucking stupid. Delta converges at 1. I'm just lazy and didn't add the MIN formula to the excel sheet. In this example I chose around 110 for the ITM mark.](https://preview.redd.it/wi3rmq7gias61.png?width=290&format=png&auto=webp&s=64ef93f01bb4f3e2e4c0b46a44da206600a795d8)

This is why the FDs sometimes print harder than jpow... just kidding jpow. But seriously this is the dream we all look for when it comes to buying options. Watching something far otm get good price movement and watching gamma inject delta with massive print potential for us.

Don't be deceived by this example. Gamma is not static. Gamma is 0 when you're ITM as you can't have a Delta above 1. Gamma is also nearly 0 when you're so far OTM that it basically doesn't matter. Say if you bought a 800c on something trading for like 180... which I'm sure no one here every does.

Look at this actual gamma curve.

[https://preview.redd.it/75h0wbofjas61.png?width=206&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d3d4a5f2430dd0c337d81cdf97fbc0afd7d6153](https://preview.redd.it/75h0wbofjas61.png?width=206&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d3d4a5f2430dd0c337d81cdf97fbc0afd7d6153)

In the middle of the bell curve is where delta is basically .5. small shifts in underlying change cause massive shift in option price change relatively speaking. Again when you're on the fringes => super ITM or super OTM your gamma is 0 because your delta really can't change unless it completely violently reverses itself.

# Gamma Squeeze

There's been a ridiculous amount of talk about gamma squeezes and very little talk about how they mechanically work. Again I'll keep this brief and try to use pictures so I don't hurt anyone's smooth brain. JK read a book retard.

Remember that we talked about delta neutral positions and how it's important as a market maker to remain delta neutral to mitigate risks. Well gamma squeezes are actually fairly simple and I think I've explained it before but not as elaborately as this. The way it must work is the buying pressure of the short position holders to become delta neutral or cover their positions must thrust the price upward triggering delta changes which then again trigger more covering and delta neutral buying. I made some pictures for you dickheads.

# Warning: This next image has math

[https://preview.redd.it/k2kg08p46bs61.png?width=1405&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ce64da8f8fef106bc815fe01a193207a55589a5](https://preview.redd.it/k2kg08p46bs61.png?width=1405&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ce64da8f8fef106bc815fe01a193207a55589a5)

Here's an example of a failure. This shows that although there was a proper ladder of options bought that could have forced the gamma squeeze there simply was not enough buying pressure in the period to force the gamma squeeze. Take a very close look at some of the option levels. Stupid humans like round numbers for some reason so we like to buy lots of options around the '50' or '100' levels in underlying. This is a fictional piece I made up that should illustrate the point.

[https://preview.redd.it/imtdd8yd1bs61.png?width=1597&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c55589e36441728cde6a695ffd9748a3139ec92](https://preview.redd.it/imtdd8yd1bs61.png?width=1597&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c55589e36441728cde6a695ffd9748a3139ec92)

Do not obsess over this silly little picture. It's impossible to make excel really show gamma squeeze because excel does not like circular references and that's literally what I'm trying to explain.

I thought I was fucking up my excel formulas and then I realized that no fuck you excel, gamma squeezes are in fact a self perpetuating problem and effectively a circular reference. So I can't show you a perfect excel sheet that works.

I couldn't even calculate the Actual delta because it's dependent on price movements which are dependent on shares needed to cover which is dependent on delta etc.

Take note that the buying in the column is far less than the shares needed to cover the short sold positions. But what if there was more buying pressure on the underlying? Say we got those shares we needed to push the price up. We'd start to see a chain reaction. The short position holders would increasingly become the buyers of long shares.

Look at the left ""Gamma Movements"" That's the same as the number the price on the underlying has increased by one. A gamma movement as I'm describing it is an action in buying sufficient enough to push the price up by $1. This causes gamma to increase delta which then causes more buying from the short position holders to be gamma neutral and the cycle continues.

The key is to have enough ATM/ITM options to force gamma neutral hedging. I already explained that ATM and ITM have the highest delta and thus will cause the most hedging for short position holders. Those ATM/ITM positions are also the most profitable / least risky in the event of a failure to sqoz.

It's outrageously odd to see a proper gamma squeeze happen so don't bank on seeing one any time soon. I just wanted to try to illuminate some of these mechanics as I understand them.

My explanations aren't perfect because I'm not. At least I'm putting something effort into it.

TLDR: read the post you lazy bitch. Read a book too while you're at it."

2021-04-13 10:08:50,wallstreetbets,"You do understand that there are ways for market makers to trade options themselves in order to remain gamma or delta neutral, right? I think your understanding and calculations only take into account the use of stocks or shorts as a hedge, rather than the full buffet of options available. In essence, you‚Äôre using addition on calculus.        

Edit: before you think OP is actually smart instead of just copy/pasting stuff, here are some examples of when people accused me of being wrong and stupid, but in hindsight it probably could have saved a few lives if they had listened to me.          

Please understand that the second you start playing with IV and theta, it throws all of the delta and gamma hedging out the window since there is so much spread trading on high IV stock.            

Good luck to anyone who tries to use OP‚Äôs example as an outlier for options trading. I thought the same way my first few weeks of options trading back when I made no money.

however it is late and i have one burning ape question:

&#x200B;

a large portion of OTM puts for a random share ($MOON) are at 4-10$.

the $MOON is at 140$.

according to my understanding of your post, these puts literally have no effect on price movement because of delta close to -1 ? so gamma is very low at these delta values.

&#x200B;

are such puts literally a waste of money if not slightly ATM (say delta between - 0.7 and -0.4)?

in other words: would HFs with already existing short positions benefit from buying such puts?

Delta neutral is a portfolio strategy utilizing multiple positions with balancing positive and negative deltas so that the overall delta of the assets in question totals zero.

Women have autoimmune disorders at something like 9:1 compared to men. It's no surprise to me that all the vaccinated people affected were women. Their bodies overreacted to some component of the adenovirus in the JNJ vaccine or the translated protein formed.

This is about a stock that was already arguably overweight and just riding the hype of having a vaccine not only losing that hype, but also losing days or weeks of revenue from it.

J&J was already only 5% of the vaccines administered in the US where we're quickly reaching a point of finding people willing to get the vaccine being more of an issue than supply of the vaccine. Absolutely nobody is going to be clamoring for the shot they get to be the J&J shot going forward whether it's 6 out of 6.8 million or 6 out of 68 million.

Anecdotal.

> this is such a minuscule number it‚Äôs totally trying to scare the public

The number doesn't matter, the halt does. Especially in a landscape where there was already superior competition and they were only 5% of the market share in the US. Now what they've sold so far has been largely at cost, but what we're talking about is the potential and revenue going forward, which this will now create almost none. Because for ever anecdote you can come up with to support it, the largest group of people who walk in to get one will have just as many to pick one of the others.

You're literally just making a case for vaccines in general and applying it to this vaccine because you think that the argument against it is anti-vax. It's not, it's common sense. It was a rushed product where significant cracks are already forming, vastly inferior to its competitors in every way but the convenience of a single shot. 

$JNJ barely beat earnings estimates last quarter and soared on the back of having this promising vaccine. It's not longer promising and didn't make them any kind of real money, but has significant liabilities going forward.

The problem here is that you're trying to make the moral argument of ""risk vs. reward,"" about getting vaccinated at all rather than looking at the reality of its potential going forward. And I'm sorry to tell you, but there isn't really any. It has been halted and all of the math still points to it having no impact on the adoption rate of a COVID vaccine in general in the US. It's an unnecessary entry at this point.

So I'm sorry that you've come up with all of this fancy logic of why it's not that dangerous, but the reality is that its still the most dangerous option in an oversaturated marketplace... Go look at what happens to an airline when they have a plane crash, even though the odds of one of their planes crashing remains astronomically low. 

We've known for awhile that we were reaching the point where we have more doses than people willing to get them. And it's why we've known about the blood clot thing being a possible issue for weeks, but just now being pressing enough for these doses to be halted.

Note 7 owners were more likely to be struck by lightning than have the phone blow up, but that didn't stop virtually every user from looking for an alternative.

Nobody is trying to scare the public, stop trying to make this a crusade. This is just a realistic outlook on both the business aspects of this halt as well as the reality of what such early issues with the vaccine mean for it going forward. There are two perfectly good vaccines people are going to get instead.

But again, it's your money, torch it over the next few weeks if you want. Personally, I'd never trade based on morality rather than reality, but that's just me. The administration that is choosing to halt this is a big supporter of vaccines, there's absolutely no reason you should be making this a crusade about the government trying to scare you."

This:

> ""This announcement will not have a significant impact on our vaccination plan,"" said Jeff Zients, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator. ""Johnson & Johnson vaccine makes up less than 5% of the recorded shots in arms in the United States to date.""

This entire thing hinges around the fact its an unneeded third party in the vax roadmap and it's a shame a lot of people are going to lose money betting on it tp rebound. $JNJ was a shitty play before the halt because people bought in thinking they were making big money in the short term on these when they weren't, any potential it had was in long term doses once the pandemic was over and it would be more socially acceptable for them to charge more than cost.

Sure they have a ton of other products... and they were priced accordingly for that before the pandemic. I don't even have a dog in this fight, I bought $155 calls for 3 cents each when the blood clotting thing first popped up, sold them at open for 80 cent each. At this point I'm just trying to point out the semi-longterm reality of the company."
2021-04-13 14:38:40,wallstreetbets,"Again, you're arguing the morality of vaccines rather than the reality. The reality is no one wants the shitty third options that may or may not kill you no matter how small the chance in an oversaturated marketplace.

I'm from Indiana, dude, I've witnessed first hand how minor public perception of products affects Eli Lilly's stock price. If you work there and haven't seen that, you probably shouldn't be hanging around a subreddit whose sole purpose is discussing business and investment.

You're way too invested in the scientific discussion of this rather than the business discussion which is.... kind of the entire point of this subreddit. There are 50 other subreddits you could go discuss the science of this, don't come in the one discussing the business of it and then whine when someone's discussion is about public perception and how that affects revenue."
2021-04-13 09:18:24,wallstreetbets,"Right, it's a problem with causation and correlation.  In reality, the data would actually support the idea that the vaccine leads to a reduction in blood clots, since the percentage of people who have them after the vaccine is lower than the general populace overall.  However, that too would be an unreachable conclusion given the short-term results we have.  I don't disagree that there should careful review of the data, but when a literal handful of people out of thousands and thousands that received a shot show blood clots, you shouldn't be publishing scary headlines implying that the vaccine isn't safe."

  Worst case scenario, if a variant comes along that is immune to the vaccines, its full-on pandemic 2.0.  COVID has basically launched a whole sub-family of coronaviruses into the human virus pool, we aren't adapted, and we only have a few vaccines for this group.  This stuff is complicated and no one learns virology in school even tho its more useful than calculus."

You realize either way you're gambling right? Getting the vaccine you're gambling with incredibly good odds that you'll be totally fine, with a tiny chance of developing more serious complications. Without the vaccine you get to gamble every time you leave your house.

Don't compare trying to save millions of lives to the Nazi regime, that's incredibly insensitive, considering the motive here is to protect millions of lives, rather than exterminate them.

No one's coming for your freedoms you nut job, they're trying to save millions more people from dying."

Any virus actively propagating will mutate at a rate dependent upon a number of conditions, so the more it spread the more it will mutate.  In other words it does not mutate when dormant.

Bottom line: this is a blip for J&J and it is not an issue with their vaccine."

It really is just the perfect ruse they have going. All the vaccinated people are going to get sick as fuck and they'll just be able to blame it on a new ""variant"". Shit is comical. God bless if you're planning on getting it or have already, truly wish you the best. There's really no point in doing so.

My only question, and this one fascinates me...will those who got the shot, after getting sick, finally wake the fuck up as to what is happening? Or will they just keep doubling down and go with the msm narrative with the variants?"

Fuck back off to /r/science if you want to discuss that other bullshit. This isn't a place for it. Unless you have some kind of insight into how the agenda you're trying to push connects to the stock price of the company, it literally just doesn't belong here.

DD: Although potentially decreasing the fraction of stimulation per jerk in the spatial dimension, I still assume that I‚Äôll be able to grasp each shaft. Doubling the number of thread members being stimulated simultaneously is hence assumed to be more efficient by approximately a factor of two.

In conclusion, I‚Äôve found that of the strategies evaluated and given reasonable assumptions and parameters, tip-to-tip strategy, which is twice as efficient as single jerk will be the most effective approach in getting through all apes as efficiently and satisfactorily as possible, so that this thing can üöÄ

Its on youtube still though and starts at about 17 minutes in.""Gamestop went through as everybody's knows... a really interesting iteration. Its brand is a result of what occurred over the last 5 months is worldwide. The IP of gamestop, its actual brand itself, is way more valued today than it had 5 months ago before it came apart of every headline around the world day after day. As the vigilantes or the reddit crowd or the robinhood crowd or whatever you want to call it, the democratization of stock trading. So you recently saw they are going up to raise captial... the analogy is netflix i guess. Saw the writing on t he wall when they were mailing CDs to everybody and said were going to digitize this and they had a brand. Maybe GME can do this same thing. Maybe they can provide added services, they have all these retail locations. Maybe they can have you know, classes, in a setting where people want to spend time together in those stores. 1200 SQ FT, 1700 of them. I dont know what the outcome would be, but if I was short that stock I would be worried and im not sure. I think its going to get a second kick at life. I think there are some very smart people that probably see what I see and the IP being worth something. And this whole social constituent use supporting it, the pricing of the stock is kind of irrelevant at this point. But if you are short you are really hurting.""

2021-04-13 13:18:38,wallstreetbets,"For those of you using CashApp to buy your GME and are wondering if your shares are being lent out, below is the reply I received from CashApp just now (yeah, I know, TLDR)  

When you hear of brokerage firms lending out customers shares for short selling those shares come from margin accounts that have signed an agreement allowing the brokerage firms to do so. Good news is that CashApp Investing does not have traditional margin accounts and we do not lend out customers shares or funds.  
Cash App Investing offers limited purpose margin accounts that do not involve any extension of credit. We do not offer traditional margin accounts at this time.  
If you place a purchase that exceeds your Cash App balance, the remaining funds will be debited from your linked debit card. This means that your buying power is limited to the combined funds available in your Cash App account balance and bank account. 

Keep in mind, purchases made using a debit card are subject to your account‚Äôs Add Cash limits. To view your Add Cash limits: 
1.  Tap the Banking tab on your Cash App home screen
2.  Select Limits. If you do not see ""Limits"", select Deposits & Transfers and scroll down to Cash Limits.

Please let me know if you have any other questions, I am always happy to help.

Thank you,

2021-04-13 07:43:46,wallstreetbets,"Cohen will likely not take the CEO spot, rather, he‚Äôll bring in someone with a large amount of digital and e-commerce experience while maintaining the chairman seat. Reasons I love GameStop right now aside from the squeeze:

PR - most investing in GameStop are gamers or know gamers in their circle. They understand the massive potential in the market that continues to grow at a ridiculous pace. GameStop‚Äôs name is everywhere right now and we‚Äôll think (along with many others) to buy from GameStop before we look elsewhere.

Experience - the executive team is now littered with some of the brightest in the business. Their focus? THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. They‚Äôre not just selling a GPU or a Keyboard - they‚Äôre selling the experience that comes with it and that means repeat customers, strong advocacy, and a lower cost for things such as customer acquisition (marketing, PR, etc.) See Cohen‚Äôs recent Tweet or the story about the Customer Support issue to see just how laser-focused this is. He‚Äôs learning the company bottom up as well as top down.

Apes - we‚Äôre conditioned to perform under pressure. We‚Äôve been playing games since we were  in diapers and can understand the need to hold tight and wait for the right moment. We won‚Äôt be shaken, we won‚Äôt be defeated, and we‚Äôll keep coming back - all the while enjoying the ride. That‚Äôs some good shit right there.

GME went from 141 -> 132 -> 142.

This is not a normal stock. This is fully manipulated and apes are just riding the long whales in a fight. Of course we own the float, but without long whale power there isn't much preventing shorts driving it back to $40.

Long whales said \~145 for no options gain (bad for options holders, mainly the shorts).  
Long whales completely control this at this point. Just waiting for the timing (dtcc rules etc). Hold your pants/dresses, rockets take time."

I love the DFV stolen base gif...some context:

Boston and New York have one of the most bitter rivalries in American sports but New York had dominated the rivalry ever since Boston traded Babe Ruth to them in 1918 which created ""The Curse of the Bambino."" The Yankees are one of the most successful sports franchises in the world and are often referred to as the ""Evil Empire."" They often use their obscenely large payroll to just buy the best players which led to a lot of winning and Boston could never seem to shake them.

Finally in 2004, the two teams met in a best-of-7 series in what is essentially the semi-finals for pro baseball. The Yankees had a 3 games to none lead and no team had ever come back from such a deficit in MLB history. The Yankees had a 4-3 lead going into the final inning of the fourth and potentially final game of the series with one of the greatest pitchers of all time, Mariano Rivera in to close out the game. A runner was able to make it on base and a faster runner was  subsequently subbed in, presumably to try to steal a base. Everyone knew exactly what he was planning to do and if he failed that would have been a huge blow to Boston's chances. But it ended up paying off as the next batter was able to get him home with a single and tie the game. This stolen base is seen as a turning point as Boston went on the win that game and the next three, winning the series and allowing them to go on to win their first World Series in 86 years.

So...
Yankees = Hedge funds

Boston = Apes

Just like everyone knew Dave Roberts would try to steal that base, everyone knows the apes' strategy (buy and hold). It's risky to put so much on the line versus a powerful opponent, but it's the risk that must be taken in order to come out victorious. Hopefully we are seeing a similar turning point as that stolen base represents."

"" Massachusetts native [Tanyon Sturtze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanyon_Sturtze) pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Hern√°ndez. [Mariano Rivera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariano_Rivera),  the Yankees star closer, entered the game in the eighth for a  two-inning save attempt. In the ninth inning, Rivera allowed a lead-off  walk to [Kevin Millar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Millar), which ultimately turned out to be the turning point of the series. [Dave Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Roberts_(outfielder))  was then chosen to pinch-run for Millar. With the Red Sox down to their  final three outs, Rivera checked Roberts at first base several times  before throwing a pitch to [Bill Mueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mueller). 

On Rivera's first pitch to Mueller, the speedy Roberts [stole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base)  second, putting himself in scoring position. Mueller's single allowed  Roberts to score, resulting in Rivera blowing the save and the game  going into extra innings, tied at four runs apiece. """

If you invested in GME you should have answered yes to all those questions. You already should have known this was going to be a bumpy ride when you initially invested and the current state of GME is the result of this volatility. The research hasn‚Äôt changed, you can go back and look through this sub for some DDs if you‚Äôre worried. Nothing has changed, all of that research is the same today as it was when you invested. 

If you are panic selling now, or even just thinking about it, it means you were not responsible enough to do your research before buying in. Sorry to say, but you probably shouldn‚Äôt have invested in GME, or really anything. 

Apes don‚Äôt panic when the stock acts exactly as expected. The stock is acting exactly as expected. We aren‚Äôt panicking. Are you?"

Green bars with a line below and nothing above usually means a red bar is following. 

When the rocket is taking off, you‚Äôll see green with no lines below one after another. Until then, calm your tits.

2021-04-13 10:00:04,wallstreetbets,"In 1964, a stock displayed previously unprecedented market behavior. It was one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market at that time and due to a unique combination of investors buying an unusual amout and the company itself restructuring, it resulted in massive up-and-down swings of the stock in a way that hadnt really been seen before this way. It went from around 15$ to 600$ within two weeks and became popular among amateur investors. Lots of people bought in and when the stock tanked awhile later down to around 30$, a sizable amout of people panic sold. A week later the stock went up to 2400$ for several days and then settled around the 200$ range after that. Several people who sold during the initial crash would later call it the greatest mistake of their life and among the involved people, a correlation in the following 20 years between suicides and the people who sold the stock at a low prize point has been suggested. That stocks name? Albert Einstein.

Let's say you hold 1000 shares and the price goes up by $0.10 today. Darn! Only $100 on the day.

Let's say you're shorting the stock and you have invested all you have into making sure the price stays down. A $0.10 increase day seems like nothing to share holders, but factor in interest rates, having to cover positions and calls, and the many short positions and you have a loss that amounts to a couple million dollars. 

This is happening EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. 

Price goes up lightly or bigly = HF lose the day 

Price goes down a little = HF lose the day

Price stays at anything above $1 = HF still have to cover their short positions

Its on youtube still though and starts at about 17 minutes in.""Gamestop went through as everybody's knows... a really interesting iteration. Its brand is a result of what occured over the last 5 months is worldwide. The IP of gamestop, its actual brand itself, is way more valued today than it had 5 months ago before it came apart of every headline around the world day after day. As the vigilantes or the reddit crowd or the robinhood crowd or whatever you want to call it, the democratization of stock trading. So you recently saw they are going up to raise captial... the analogy is netflix i guess. Saw the writing ont he wall when they were mailing CDs to everybody and said were goign to digitize this and they had a brand. Maybe GME can do this same thing. Maybe they can provide added services, they have all these retail locations. Maybe they can have you know, classes, in a setting where people want to spend time together in those stores. 1200 SQ FT, 1700 of them. I dont know what the outcome would be, but if I was short that stock I would be worried and im not sure. I think its going to get a second kick at life. I think there are some very smart people that probably see what I see and the IP being worth something. And this whole social constituent use supporting it, the pricing of the stock is kind of irrelevant at this point. But if you are short you are really hurting."""

I  just received a 200+page booklet in the mail as a TLRY/APHA shareholder  and thought I'd share some of the information with you guys.

\- The Aphria live audio meeting will take place on April 14th at 4:00pm EST at [www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021)

\- The Tilray meeting will take place on April 16th at 11:00am EST at [www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TLRY2021SM](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TLRY2021SM)

\-  shareholders of APHA will receive 0.8381 of a share of TLRY at the  merger (I wonder why Tilray's trading lower than Aphria right now? *edit:  oh, my broker shows tilray in USD but aphria in CAD so it's confusing,  they're trading at roughly .833 difference which is normal*)

\-  the two companies combined will create the world's largest global  cannabis company, with pro forma revenue of US$685m (C$874m) for the  last 12 mo. prior to the Dec.16/20 merger announcement.

\-  shareholders will vote on approvals for Tilray's charter amendment,  share issuance, advisory compensation, and adjournment proposals to  revise them;

\- increase the authorized capital stock of TLRY from 743,333,333 shares to 900,000,000 (890m class 2 common, 10m preferred)

There's  a lot of information to pore over in the booklet, these are just some  quick points. I am not a financial advisor, use this information at your  own peril."

Unfortunately for them MRNA and Biontech have the only cure. Pfizer got smart and partnered with Biontech because they have the means to run a full trial, that is the only reason they were first to market. As far as J&J let‚Äôs not forget how many people developed cancer over baby powder. They were a corrupt company and always will put profit over people."

2021-04-13 07:06:11,wallstreetbets,"Futures are flat as of 0630. This follows a blah day Monday when not much happened. That is all due to change with the Consumer Price Index reports for March, due out at 0830.

Expectations are for a 2.5% YoY print, up over 1.7% in February. The MoM number is anticipated at 0.5% (0.4% in Feb). This is a big data release because inflation, more than anything, is what will force the Fed to tighten interest rates. Once that happens it puts the Bull Market on borrowed time and eventually starts a Bear Market. That, at least, has been the pattern.

Powell and Co. have been making the rounds preemptively talking down inflation concerns. They‚Äôre saying any spike in inflation is due to be ‚Äòtransitory.‚Äô Ultimately none of that may matter. Transitory or not, higher consumer prices (and higher markets, though they would never admit it) will force the Fed‚Äôs hand. So that‚Äôs why this is so important.

A good gauge of the market‚Äôs expectation of Fed policy is the Fed futures contract from CME Group. That and 5-year Treasury yields, which have been moving steadily higher. But that‚Äôs just the market expectations. The CPI print is what will move that. And if that number beats to the upside there is sure to be something resembling fear. That means selling of risk assets, like stocks.

Watch energy markets too. There are many factors affecting energy prices but inflation is one. To wit, crude is up about 1% this morning."

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe. So please, before you make a post asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb question again."

I was so embarrassed in our client call today and the fucked thing was he changed my entire report and they ripped it apart because they were looking for WHAT I ORIGINALLY had in it! Then he‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh can you check why we removed that?‚Äù ON the video call. Like dude....I can‚Äôt even say your dumbass removed it for no reason. 

He has the intelligence level of my dumbest analyst and he‚Äôs a partner. I‚Äôm also fairly certain he lied a fuckton for this job because he‚Äôs supposed to be an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù in my specialty and I‚Äôm teaching him like day 1 basics....

# FAQ
 
## What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."

However, I have found that having a pet in my life cuts down on my loneliness. I have been more comfortable and confident when I‚Äôve lived with dogs, and they give you a reason to take walks and get sunshine which is good too. They can be really, really great friends.

But they will not make it so you don‚Äôt miss people anymore. That will still be there. It doesn‚Äôt fix the person deficit, but it does add a dog bonus, which makes it more bearable, if you follow."

Did you just think that you could fucking fool me with that comment of yours?

If that were true, then why the fuck is Chris Kyle a household name and you aren't? And plus he only had 160 kills. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. Plus why the fuck would you say you have a secret network of spies yet you just revealed that you had your secret network of spies? Are you a fucking idiot? If you can kill someone seven-hundred different ways, then list them all, I bet you can't even come up with seven. And if you had access to the entire US Marine Corps arsenal, then why the fuck did you just say you were in the Navy SEALs earlier?

What I can tell you is that you need to do a SHIT TON of DD. 

You have to know, your competitors, their costs and profitability. Costs of everything you need annually. Risks. What happens if your supplier dries up. What stops someone else from doing what you are doing or undercutting you. 

And if your plan is expansion, who is gonna help you with that, what‚Äôs your experience growing a business and managing people. Have you ever done payroll, biz taxes and how do you plan to accommodate all of your employees needs to your local tax codes and employment laws. What benefits do you plan to offer and who will be your handling HR needs.  Etc, etc. 

There‚Äôs a lot that goes into it. A solid biz plan should take a minimum of a few months of research and planning before presenting anything to a bank or professional investor. 

The main thing you have is that you already know the industry and the product you are selling is you. But you gotta know every little aspect of what can possibly go wrong and have a plan to overcome those objections and their biggest interest is going to be that you can speak to that and have a solid plan to return their money over all things in good or bad times.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I think $VIAC is a buy right now *This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I have never worked in finance in any capacity.*

Viacom CBS is one of the biggest mass media conglomerates in the world. It was formed after the merger of CBS and Viacom in 2019. It owns Paramount pictures, manages over 170 networks, such as Nickelodeon and Comedy Central and has begun a move towards online streaming with youtube channels and its Paramount Plus streaming service.

**Why $VIAC's price is so low right now**

In the past month, $VIAC has crashed over 56.33%. For those who aren‚Äôt aware, this decrease was caused by 3 factors :

* Viacom announced a 3 billion dollar stock sale causing a 23.2% crash
* Investors downgraded Viacom‚Äôs stock
* Archegos Capital Management was forced to liquidate its position in Viacom CBS, causing an additional 27% plunge in the price of VIAC [\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archegos_Capital_Management#cite_note-jcwsj-6)

**Why do I think $VIAC is a buy**

There are several reasons why Viacom CBS is a buy. Firstly, its heavily discounted because of the sudden crash and so may have a short term momentum reversal to restore its price to normal:

* The P/E ratio of $VIAC is at a very low 10.66
* According to Yahoo Finance, the average analyst price target for $VIAC is $54.65, while the price of $VIAC is currently only $39.77

Secondly, the company has been performing solidly on fundamentals:

* Viacom CBS‚Äôs earnings have experienced steady growth in 2020, from $516M in Q1 to $810M in Q4
* Viacom CBS increased operating cash flow from $1171M in 2019 to $2215M in 2020
* In a digital era, Viacom CBS has also been moving in the right direction with its online streaming services, it gained 30M new global streaming subscribers last year and Global streaming & digital video revenue increased 71% year-over-year to $888M
* In Q4, CBS was the most-watched network in Daytime and Late Night and claimed the quarter‚Äôs top drama, news magazine and 4 of the top 5 comedies, as well as the top new comedy series

On the negative side, it must be noted that $VIAC's short interest is 18%, meaning it would take shorts 2 days to cover (source: [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=viac&submit=Short+Quote](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=viac&submit=Short+Quote)), so there is a fair amount of negative sentiment. 

TLDR :

$VIAC is a strong company at a crazy discount. $VIAC TO THE MOON"

They have movie rights to the mission impossible movies and the Star Trek franchise and others that I don‚Äôt know off the top of my head. Pluto TV 30m monthly users that use the service free and is supported by ad revenue. Paramount+ has two level support entry with 6.99 for full access with adds or 9.99 without. Which is cheaper than everyone out there with a larger original and purchased catalog than most other services. For either level you get live TV that includes CBS, CBSN, CBS sports, and ET live. CBS has been the top rated network for 17 of the last 18 years. They own their own studios so making new content is easier than Netflix or Amazon. They are expanding into Latin America by acquiring Chilevision from ATT which is a free to air network that had 22% of all viewership in 2020. Good P/E. Dividends....positive revenue....the short play is timing the options right, which I have failed, still have a few out that might print. Other than that decades old proven company with solid fundamentals with an average PT 50% higher than current price. It‚Äôs a safe play for retirement funds....and here‚Äôs hoping that today is the day it goes up. Right now it‚Äôs up 1.30 and holding which is better than it has been doing for the past week.

Oh yah and earnings report out on May 6th and they aired the Super Bowel with all that ad revenue $$$"
2021-04-13 04:57:11,wallstreetbets,">Archegos Capital Management was forced to liquidate its position in Viacom CBS, causing an additional 27% plunge in the price of VIAC

Archegos used 5x leverage that propped VIAC. He went from 1 bank, bought a bunch of bananas that caused the price of bananas to go up. Hwang being a brilliant kind of ape, went to a second bank and did the same thing. He repeated the process 5x on half a dozen banana brands driving up the share price of all his bananas. Hwang did this through a shady practice with banks call TRS (total return swaps). TRS is kinda like the same kind of dirty bank deals that brought down the mortgage system in '08.

The important takeaway to keep in mind is the TRS. Hwang didn't technically own the bananas, the banks did and their dumb asses are sweeping it under the rug, waiting for another Archegos."
2021-04-13 09:02:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm a simple idiot, but I think it is a good long term buy just based on the 5 year graph...  Lots of stocks at all time highs with insane P/E ratios, but VIAC is down from where it was even in Dec 2019 with a non-crazy P/E ratio.  Also they are moving towards streaming services as they should be.

It will probably get driven a bit lower first bc of the reasons mentioned, but I agree it is a buy."
2021-04-13 10:03:25,wallstreetbets,"What's up thinking streaming is an automatic success? 
It's their second one after failing at cbs all access and they rushed the relaunch so they are out there without a flagship show, identity, or something to set it apart from the prior.  

Strong catalog and new management is better than old, but that's not saying much.  Fundamentals are still there, but will continue to struggle without a focal point for new subs."
2021-04-13 12:34:15,wallstreetbets,$VIAC to the mooooooooooon!
2021-04-13 14:19:26,wallstreetbets,"Took a while for them to embrace streaming but they're here now and have a huge catalog.

2021-04-13 14:17:31,wallstreetbets,Their 5 year graph looks like hot shit.
2021-04-13 10:34:42,wallstreetbets,"Catalog of shows is most important. Anyone who switches to streaming only would probably be interested in Paramount+ at some point considering how many popular shows and movies they own.

CBS all access was just... CBS only but in an app, not very interesting. This one has more potential.

Whether or not Viacom will actually be able to make a good product im not sure though.

The company is trading right now on fundamentals like a value stock at these prices, even a bit on the low side really indicating it is oversold in my opinion. Then with paramount+ there is a little bit of good growth potential, so thats why I think the stock is good at this price.

I don't really think its a great WSB stock though more of a good buy at these prices for a longer hold than a buy options type of thing."

2021-04-13 09:43:38,wallstreetbets,The 5 year chart doesn't paint a great picture due to the merger and share count. But just by looking at the fundamentals it's a solid company with a fwd pe ratio of 9 and plenty of upside from streaming.
2021-04-13 14:12:00,wallstreetbets,"Paramount+ would be one justification.

Their increased income is another."
2021-04-13 11:04:36,wallstreetbets,"I hate alot of companies but I love money more. 

At these levels with a reliable dividend between 2-3% depending on where the price reaches support there will be interest from boomer retirement funds, pension funds, indowments etc. No 700% GME run up coming but eventually it will move up. 

If only I knew when."
2021-04-13 09:47:35,wallstreetbets,VIAC has at least 10x more volume on any given day. If there is a spike in price it will be easier to unload your position as there will actually be buyers
2021-04-13 09:16:43,wallstreetbets,Well either works but VIAC is cheaper right now
2021-04-13 08:45:03,wallstreetbets,"I'm in the same boat, but I'm going to stay away from writing calls on VIAC because that is how I got swept up in VIAC to start with."
2021-04-13 15:43:37,wallstreetbets,you still got it on a fire sale. Just now it is on clearance. But P/E is around 9 so you‚Äôre in luck with earnings coming up

2021-04-13 08:24:09,wallstreetbets,It just expires at the end of this month lol
2021-04-13 08:04:03,wallstreetbets,I hope this works out for u cause I got calls expiring 4/30 but someone not so optimistic might say pltr is long term
2021-04-13 10:08:24,wallstreetbets,"I have some 22.5c 4/23.  Im banking solely on demo day tomorrow, if it doesn't rip by then im out.  Let's cross our fingers and hope this pans out."
2021-04-13 10:04:46,wallstreetbets,710x 100 shares for each contract
2021-04-13 01:26:14,wallstreetbets,"lmao I don't think you fully realize the risks here, it needs to go up rapidly today for this to ever make any money. 

you need to understand the risks better"
2021-04-13 19:57:44,wallstreetbets,Did you sell?
2021-04-13 07:36:55,wallstreetbets,Lol I did that a day or two after not lieing they must of noticed the BSing.  Guess I will wait a bit and try again
2021-04-13 15:46:15,wallstreetbets,the second 25 call would fall after earnings.. so there's that..
2021-04-13 16:51:46,wallstreetbets,Post update on your post bro not in the comments!
2021-04-13 08:02:10,wallstreetbets,"But on a serious note, it‚Äôs fine I guess. Get rich or die trying. I might get out if it goes below 30k"

2021-04-13 15:48:05,wallstreetbets,Posted my good sir for that sweet karma
2021-04-13 11:56:29,wallstreetbets,I believe it will go to 29 in the next week or so. My target for all this is 29 and I would sell.
2021-04-13 11:26:12,wallstreetbets,Hahaha üòÇüòÇ
2021-04-13 08:04:30,wallstreetbets,I had shares and I moved to this.

2021-04-13 06:24:00,wallstreetbets,Just fyi - if it goes up even 5% I have till end of this week for a break even.
2021-04-13 19:59:47,wallstreetbets,90% sold. 10% letting it run
2021-04-13 10:09:09,wallstreetbets,Also in your risk assessment make sure its high risk.
2021-04-13 08:06:24,wallstreetbets,Look in ASTS. That's my other get rich or go broke play. It's either zero or $1000 by 2027.
2021-04-13 11:58:48,wallstreetbets,"You are betting on 23% jump in a week. Good luck bro but it would be much smarter to just get 1 leap with whatever is left. 

Hoping for miracles is not a very good way to trade."
2021-04-13 12:10:43,wallstreetbets,"Why do you think it'll go to 29? I thought the consensus is that itll drop after doubleclick (this week).

Positions:
Holding a few 24C 4/23 and 25.5C 4/30"
2021-04-13 08:04:55,wallstreetbets,"Fukien retard, good luck"

Prove me wrong"
2021-04-13 14:11:23,wallstreetbets,Double click event and a lot of consolidation in this area. Just fyi.
2021-04-13 12:23:41,wallstreetbets,Inverse consensus and you win! Haha. Just kidding I feel like pltr has been consolidating at this range for quite a while and is breaking out.
2021-04-13 19:12:17,wallstreetbets,Back in my shares position with a nice huge profit.

2021-04-13 09:26:40,wallstreetbets,Well why not? PLTR is not new to 20% swings in a day.
2021-04-13 14:11:39,wallstreetbets,sell the news event
2021-04-13 16:48:01,wallstreetbets,"I try to avoid big news but consolidation is what made me buy too + many other tech stocks making ATH ( goog, msft etc)

2021-04-13 09:58:10,wallstreetbets,theta will kill it faster than it can go up
2021-04-13 09:28:33,wallstreetbets,"Based on what it‚Äôs going to jump 20%? 

Sounds like you are hoping for a miracle here. 

I don‚Äôt think you fully calculated the probabilities here. If u fully grasped just how low the probability of making money on $30 calls u would have never purchased them"
2021-04-13 14:12:20,wallstreetbets,It didn‚Äôt go up to sell the news.

2021-04-13 10:37:58,wallstreetbets,Options are designed to enhance the yield of long term accounts of major stock holders while either allowing them to keep their shares or sell them at a premium that is worth it to THEM. There are disciplines that might allow traders to exploit inefficiencies and technical moves. Generally these are mounted cavalry strategies- not artillery or infantry tactics. Sometimes the infantry can win but their losses pale against their risks of annihilation. Sorry for you loss.

2021-04-13 02:00:53,wallstreetbets,Does wash go from option loss to then buying shares instead ?
2021-04-13 04:26:23,wallstreetbets,"Well if he sells it again after buying back in those losses come back into play though correct? Since it‚Äôs added to the cost basis, if I‚Äôm not mistaking"
2021-04-13 05:45:49,wallstreetbets,With what?
2021-04-13 11:01:30,wallstreetbets,Sheesh
2021-04-13 13:14:12,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure about the implications of carrying a loss forward but I was looking into wash sales recently and learned some things.

1.) Different strikes / prices don't count toward wash sale losses that are disallowed. They are treated as a different security.

2.) When you have wash sale losses that are disallowed you don't entirely lose the ability to claim that loss against other earnings. The wash sale loss gets added to your cost basis so in the end your tax burden will in fact only be based on your net gains.

3.)And this is the sweeeeeetest part about it. If you are say swing trading a particular stock and keep buying and selling buying and selling etc for over a year, each time you do a wash sale the time period you held it for gets added to your total holding time. This means that if you swing trade say, AMD all year long, by the time you pass a year of doing this your trades will now be taxed at long term capital gains instead of short term gapital gains. Once again this is ONLY if the securities are the same. So like, JUST AMD stock, or JUST one exact long term option.

Here's a ton more info:

https://www.tradelogsoftware.com/resources/wash-sales/

I got scared AF when I saw an article about some guy who apparently made 40k on trades but owed 800k in taxes and looked into it and apparently that article was just completely wrong. I looked at my OWN statement from last year(my first year of trading) and I had 14k in wash sales on 900k in volume. My net losses per the app were about $4500 and even though I had 14k in wash sales my actual net profit / loss for last year was -4500. If the wash sales would have been fucking me I would have shown a 16k profit and had to pay taxes on that 16k."
2021-04-13 08:38:31,wallstreetbets,"if you have time and care to explain this more to me, i would really appreciate it. even if it‚Äôs just clarifying if this rule only applies to calls, or it is for all forms of trades."
2021-04-13 04:58:23,wallstreetbets,"Correct, with so much loss, you can roll it over for 30 years at 3k/year, or offset any new gain with the remaining carryover"
2021-04-13 09:08:40,wallstreetbets,"~~It appears you are correct. F for OP.~~

Edit: person below me is right cast me into the pit

>~~A net capital loss is carried back 3 years and forward up to 5 years as a short-term capital loss.~~  
>  
>Net capital losses in excess of $3,000 can be carried forward indefinitely until the amount is exhausted.

You really don't understand the leverage in options.

You could easily 10x or even 100x your money in a very short amount of time... and just as quickly lose it all.

2021-04-13 07:23:31,wallstreetbets,Shit like this is why there won't be a squeeze - all free money for the HFs
2021-04-13 07:32:10,wallstreetbets,Beautiful
2021-04-13 08:11:18,wallstreetbets,Makes you wonder what OP thought he was doing
2021-04-13 07:49:39,wallstreetbets,But I thought more risk == more tendies
2021-04-13 09:30:10,wallstreetbets,AND he could have sold covered calls. Fuck even if he sold leaps he could have made 20k+ and just left the stock alone and never have to look at it again lmao
2021-04-13 07:55:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but if GME goes to ten trillion per share, he‚Äôll make out pretty well!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
2021-04-13 12:13:20,wallstreetbets,500 shares... he has 5 contracts.
2021-04-13 14:35:58,wallstreetbets,"How is this even possible? Was the IV really this high at some point to get call prices to ~$170? The most ITM, longest dated option for GME ($2 Jan 2023 C) is only $141.00 right now, and the OP must have been buying a much shorter expiry that is much more OTM, effectively perfectly timing the tops in price AND in IV AND in bid/ask spread in order to get to that purchase price.

If I specifically sat down today to lose money, I don't think I could have bought something as retarded as this."
2021-04-13 07:56:04,wallstreetbets,He went FULL retard
2021-04-13 08:07:37,wallstreetbets,Wow. Just wow
2021-04-13 08:11:09,wallstreetbets,You have drove the message home sir. Splendid synopsis
2021-04-13 10:44:47,wallstreetbets,Hmm maybe I‚Äôm missing it but I‚Äôm assuming he bought these when GME price was way higher otherwise the premium wouldn‚Äôt be this high
2021-04-13 09:51:21,wallstreetbets,I truly believe this might be the dumbest thing that will happen on WSB for as long as this sub remains active.
2021-04-13 11:03:10,wallstreetbets,Gleeeeesh
2021-04-13 11:53:35,wallstreetbets,Dat IV.  Gotta do the math before buying.  Lessons were hopefully learned.  Most people who've played with options have probably been burned by this at one point or another.
2021-04-13 13:41:14,wallstreetbets,Jesus when you say it like that it‚Äôs truly an amazingly retarded scenario. Like full stop. STOP.
2021-04-13 18:08:22,wallstreetbets,Options are fucking magic! Amazing!
2021-04-13 19:02:23,wallstreetbets,Pro tip: do some basic research into options before dumping $90k into 100% OTM calls that cost the same as 100 shares.
2021-04-13 10:38:29,wallstreetbets,"Pack it up.  We hit full retard.  I can't even design a scenario in my brain that would be worse than this.  This is the lowest bar on retard, everything from here on should compare to this."
2021-04-13 05:21:04,wallstreetbets,"This is a multilingual space. Please translate that for our Spanish speakers too.

>el retardo"
2021-04-13 05:09:22,wallstreetbets,This is beyond retarded. This is some next level shit.
2021-04-13 03:08:18,wallstreetbets,But those where apes!
2021-04-13 03:14:05,wallstreetbets,"The premium OP paid was 172.80 per contract (for 5 options contracts), which is multiplied by 100 since every contract controls 100 shares.

172.80 x 100 x 5 = $86,400

They are now worth .63 premium (per contract):

.63 x 100 x 5 = $315

So yeah, unless the stock sees quick upward momentum this week, OP is out a bunch of money."
2021-04-13 03:12:52,wallstreetbets,Op paid $172 for each of his options that are now worth $.63
2021-04-13 03:52:02,wallstreetbets,You're among friends now
2021-04-13 09:57:04,wallstreetbets,"He paid 173 per share in a bet that they would go above 173 in the next week. If they don't increase past that price he loses everything.

Really, it's even dumber than that. Because of the high premium the stock has to get way over $500 not to lose money on the deal.

He could have just bought the shares and then at least retained whatever their value is once he sells. He basically managed to turn a call into a day higher risk than just buying shares, with no upside."
2021-04-13 04:02:03,wallstreetbets,">At what point was it possible to buy an option contract for $17,280 with a $572 break even? 

It's possible if IV was sky high. OP may have bought several weeks ago."
2021-04-13 06:16:55,wallstreetbets,If you check his history he bought these on Jan 29th which was the extremely volatile day where GME had its second peak.
2021-04-13 04:16:02,wallstreetbets,During the initial squeeze $1200 calls were going for 25k. It was insanity.
2021-04-13 12:39:22,wallstreetbets,"No, he was betting that GME would be 172 above 400, or 572. But that's only breakeven. It's stupid for so many reasons, even if you're bullish on GME."
2021-04-13 05:53:03,wallstreetbets,I bought 170 puts with 5/26 expiration. üåàbear.
2021-04-13 05:54:27,wallstreetbets,Chicken
2021-04-13 07:37:30,wallstreetbets,I'm looking hard at a bond etf now lol.
2021-04-13 11:03:50,wallstreetbets,Shares
2021-04-13 18:57:43,wallstreetbets,"Just buy shares, they're going to 100k+ at least anyway, maybe even 1m or more.

If you're gonna be a millionaire anyway just take the safe route."
2021-04-13 05:53:00,wallstreetbets,Low... the odds are low.
2021-04-13 06:47:29,wallstreetbets,"Same here. I'm up 9% over the past month while a bunch of idiots keep posting their massive losses from GME, which is down like 50% in that same time frame. I feel like a genius, but really I'm just not an absolute idiot"
2021-04-13 03:05:01,wallstreetbets,r/thetagang : yeah what an idiot! *nervously looks at underlying being down 50%*
2021-04-13 03:42:52,wallstreetbets,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand it's gone
2021-04-13 12:41:29,wallstreetbets,"What happens to the 86,000? Do we have a winner in these kind of trades?

Ps: i have no idea how these trades works. So could be a stupid question."
2021-04-13 08:25:10,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt forget, when these options expire it‚Äôll be some huge conspiracy by the brokers to take away this guys contracts that he rightfully purchased, and proof it‚Äôs going to $1,000,000,000,000 a share."
2021-04-13 02:46:18,wallstreetbets,"Cmon bro, don't kick OP while he's down. He still has a chance. A very very miniscule itsy bitsy chance that GME squeezes tomorrow. Lets root for him instead."
2021-04-13 02:19:58,wallstreetbets,Oh shit imma duck these shots you fired at dude
2021-04-13 06:39:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but these options cost him about $170 per share, it literally would have been almost no different to just buy the fucking shares.  

Sure, if the contracts are cheap, like 1-2% of the share price then it can be worth it but when OTM calls are like 90% the price of the underlying for weeklies what are you doing trading options? It‚Äôs not a risky move, it‚Äôs literally just being a fucktard."
2021-04-13 16:00:49,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you're actually hitting on me right now. 


And I get that, but this is a stock that obviously doesn't work like others, so minimizing risk should be the nr 1 priority."
2021-04-13 00:54:45,wallstreetbets,He's not wrong
2021-04-13 01:37:18,wallstreetbets,lol he should have bought shares though
2021-04-13 01:59:58,wallstreetbets,Fidelity gang is not allowed to trade options lmao
2021-04-13 05:12:06,wallstreetbets,They make you prove you have an attention span longer than 15 minutes. Most don‚Äôt make it
2021-04-13 05:05:27,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs already paid the $86k?! Holy hell
2021-04-13 01:13:02,wallstreetbets,This comment shouldn‚Äôt be downvoted lol agreed or at least know when to exit
2021-04-13 01:09:33,wallstreetbets,These idiots really didn't realize that GME was a stupid has-been stock.
2021-04-13 05:14:54,wallstreetbets,That is one of the possibilities of the multiverse I suppose.
2021-04-13 06:32:59,wallstreetbets,Remindme! 4 days
2021-04-13 12:52:57,wallstreetbets,This sounds more like a disorder than an actual opinion
2021-04-13 06:16:49,wallstreetbets,He's not going to excersize early lol. Y'all keep getting more irrational with this squeeze theories.
2021-04-13 07:35:37,wallstreetbets,Which is who? If an ape is selling calls against their shares of GME then they are actively driving down the price. So it's likely to assume that the ones writing calls and buying puts are the people NOT on Reddit.
2021-04-13 08:47:48,wallstreetbets,"Roll your calls, you will just lose the spread, until the next expiry or the rocket"
2021-04-13 05:00:37,wallstreetbets,With a 172 premium. God damn that‚Äôs stupid on a whole new level.
2021-04-13 18:40:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes, 5 contracts = the right to purchase 500 shares.  For that kind of premium it had to be close to the top in January (ie price over 400 with 3 months until expiration) or the break even wouldn‚Äôt have been almost $600. If he bought them more recently (ie stock under $200) then that‚Äôs even more retarded."
2021-04-13 17:20:47,wallstreetbets,"Its a slur. All slurs are ""just a word"". Doesnt make it ok."
2021-04-13 04:59:47,wallstreetbets,"This is Reddit, not Parlor..."
2021-04-13 04:07:26,wallstreetbets,I THOUGHT THIS WAS AMERICA
2021-04-13 03:49:20,wallstreetbets,On the 16th he will...the closing bell....
2021-04-13 07:03:43,wallstreetbets,"His breakeven is 572 , ape didn't listen. He was supposed to buy shares, he just funded the shorts"
2021-04-13 08:00:58,wallstreetbets,Not at this point. Theta has eroded their value to the point that he has to pass break even to recover any money on them
2021-04-13 08:42:21,wallstreetbets,You are guessing
2021-04-13 14:13:28,wallstreetbets,"Unlikely. Retail's leverage from 800c is almost completely gone, and there's only a couple of weeks left of options over 500c. May its down to 430c, which means the higher premiums get them less shares hedged by market makers. Additionally, they're actively fighting the momentum of the millions of shares that market makers are already holding from all of the expired calls over the last month, and which the market makers are steadily selling off to remain delta neutral."
2021-04-13 03:05:48,wallstreetbets,I think the only thing that‚Äôs gonna be squeezed here is his arse
2021-04-13 03:49:58,wallstreetbets,You're not trying if you don't put it all in one bet

2021-04-13 08:31:16,wallstreetbets,"Correct because the loss is carried over to shares you bought within 30 days before or after you sold the same shares at a loss. You are prevented from reporting the loss until you sell the shares the loss was carried over to, unless you wash sale again."
2021-04-13 06:39:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's what I thought too, but I'll admit I don't know shit. I thought the idea for the wash sale rule was so you can't 'double count' your losses, or something along those lines. Since it gets added to the cost basis of the next purchase, to me that logically says you are correct. But please, somebody correct me if I'm wrong, because I actually want to the real answer to this. So the IRS doesn't come take my banana."
2021-04-13 14:57:04,wallstreetbets,"Yes but now imagine doing that with hundreds of trades. You could turn a 1k profit into 100k in tax liability if you end up not exiting the positions before the end of the year.

500 dollar gain, sell. Buy it again. lose 500, sell. Buy it again. repeat. You start racking up those 'wins' but none of the losses because it just keeps getting tacked on to the cost basis. At the end of the year you are holding the stock with a million dollar cost basis but your taxes have 100k in gains on them. Fucking you totally because when you sell the following year you will only be able to write off 3k"
2021-04-13 15:24:43,wallstreetbets,Yeah exactly. It's just so that you can't realize the tax benefits from the loss AND keep the shares. You have to decide between one or the other.
2021-04-13 15:59:53,wallstreetbets,Yes. Wash sale doesn't mean your losses don't count forever... They just don't count if you don't exit the rebought position and stay out of the position for the time required...
2021-04-13 09:55:20,wallstreetbets,Wash sales apply to just about everything (otherwise it'd be easier to dodge taxes). Look up the rules yourself because the thread above has already demonstrated that not a single person here actually understands wash sales.

2021-04-13 07:33:07,wallstreetbets,"> or offset any new gain with the remaining carryover

Nope. Once you carryover you can only use 3k of your accumulated loss. 

If you carryover 50k in losses and end up with 20k in profit next year you can only reduce that to 17k and then continue to carryover 47k to the following year. Cannot reduce profit to 0 and carryover only 30k to the following year.

And OP agreed to those terms, and bought 5 contracts that cost $17,280 each. $86k total.

And now we‚Äôre here at a $140 market price on GME. So clearly being able to buy shares at $400/share is a worthless ability, considering you can buy them in the open market for $140, hence why his contracts are worthless. $86k lost from OP, gained by someone else."

Next year: you start with the remaining loss, -2k. If you have no new gain/loss, then those 2k are deducted from your taxes, same as last year. If you have, let's say 4k gains, then your loss will offset the gains, 4-2=2, you will pay taxes on a capital gain of only 2k."

2021-04-13 03:59:36,wallstreetbets,"If I understand options correctly, it is a lot of factors (like the Greeks, which I am not that knowledgeable about), but it seems that the driving factor is Implied Volatility (IV) and how close to the strike price the actual stock is.  Implied Volatility is essentially how ""crazy"" the stock price has been in recent history; GME was nuts for a while and continues to be, which means that options contracts are more expensive because of that randomness (higher IV).

&#x200B;

EDIT: Also, time plays a huge part in options pricings as well; a contract 1 week from expiration is much cheaper than a contract that is 1 year away, since the stock has more time to reach the strike price.  Then you have to consider the strike price and how ITM and OTM they are... options in general are very complicated and pretty hard to sum up in one post."

2021-04-13 05:17:04,wallstreetbets,"The options are to buy shares at $315.  If the stock is at $315 the option is worthless.

If the stock is at $325 the option is worth around ten dollars.

The average cost OP paid for these options is $172.80, so he wants the share price to hit $487.80 by Friday to break even.  Alternatively, he wants the market to expect that to happen and then the option should go to a similar value to what he paid.  In which case I fully expect OP will decide to double down and buy more.

You remember all the comments a few weeks back about ""buy shares not options"" if we want to see another short squeeze?

edit:  The options are actually to buy shares at $400.  This doesn't improve things."
2021-04-13 04:14:01,wallstreetbets,"Then OP will have probably made some money or at least broke even.  Not the best answer, but it depends on so many factors.

EDIT: Actually, his breakeven is shown as $570 for the stock price.  I am not super educated on options, but he can recoup some money if the stock pops off.  I believe that breakeven prices are assuming that no other factors change, though, so if IV goes really high, then maybe he can make some money here."

When he bought the options, probably weeks or months ago, there was a believe that the share price would rise over $170 more than the strike price. The strike price isn't shown in this photo. Since they expire on Friday, the likelihood of gme going over the strike price has plummeted so the value of the call options has also"
2021-04-13 03:54:23,wallstreetbets,"Just in case my explanation is easier for you to understand than the other dude's

What he owned (the option) is simply a right to buy GME at a certain price, until a certain date.

So if you have an option to buy GME at 170, but it's about to expire and GME is at 150... that's basically worthless because you can just buy GME cheaper on the open market than your option would let you.

Whereas if GME was at say, 300, your option is very valuable, because you can buy shares at 170 and sell them for 300 on market. (You don't actually have to *do* all that buying and selling, it's all baked into the option price)"

You get a big loss to offset gains, but you didn't even ""lose"" anything because you still have the shares, the loss is just on paper, an ""artifact of tax accounting shell games."" There are similar rules for hedges and straddles, have to close the other side of the position before you get any loss, because before that rule people were deferring gains or accelerated losses for decades at a time.

Then you have nothing to worry about. The wash sale rule prohibits an investor from claiming a tax deduction for the capital loss on a stock if they sell it and then immediately (within 30 days, before or after) buy back into the position.

An example. 

You bought a 100 shares of $GME at $300 not too long ago, so ($30k). Today you decide to sell at $130 a share, leaving you with $13k and a -$17k capital loss. You could then claim a -$1,500 deduction (the annual max) from your future income when you file for the next dozen years (assuming no other net capital gains/losses).

Hours later you regret your choice and decide to buy back into $GME. So now you have 100 shares again, but also a tax-deductible capital loss. You get a tax benefit even though your position is no worse off.

The IRS says 'Hell no!' You can either keep the position or you can keep the capital loss deduction. Not both."

The Lauder family made millions of dollars and paid nothing in taxes using a strategy called short sale against the box. They have all of these shares in their own company that are now worth a lot of money, but if they sell they have to realize gain and pay taxes. So they borrow more shares from the underwriter and sell those, a classic short sale. Economically, they've just sold their original shares, because they have cash in hand and a short position that's already covered by the shares they already owned. But on paper, they still have an open short position, and before 1259 was added, if you still had an open half of a transaction, you didn't have to realize gains until you closed it, so they effectively got all the money out of their shares without having to pay taxes on it, so Congress added this Constructive Sale rule."

When it hit r/all most of these new guys don't even know what the greeks are, they have never traded properly before GME. Many FOMOed in hard and got caught up in the moment. OP is a good example, just look at that premium! Who the fuck in the right mind would pay that premium?! Buy the stock instead.

It really pissed me off when people tried to make it out to be some occupy wallstreet shit and both sides of politics made it political trying to claim. Old WSB didn't give a shit about politics, just making money. DFV did this for money (and a good job at it).

And don't get me started on how some are borderline acting like a cult here."
2021-04-13 04:14:17,wallstreetbets,"Here's quick and dumb explanation:

A 4/16/2021 $400 GME Call means that the contract will expire on the 16th of April, and that it can only be exercised if the market price of GME shares is above $400. For some reason, these contracts are for 100 shares, not less, not more, but you can buy multiple contracts if there are sellers (same as shares). That contract though has a price, called a premium, determined by the market, exactly like with the shares; in this case OP paid a premium of $172.80 per share, but since we know a contract is for 100 shares, that means OP paid $17 280 for the whole contract. And since OP bought many contracts, well it's five times that (though like with shares, you could buy each contract at a different price).

Unlike with shares, there are 2 ways to make money with a call: you can either sell it to someone else before it expires and make money that way, or you can exercise it but as we wrote before to exercise it it needs to be above the strike price, in this case $400. Exercising it, means buying the shares at the agreed price, so for a 100 shares you may need quite some cash to do that... In that case, the hope is that the shares you'll get by exercising the contract will be cheaper than at market rate, but since OP paid a huge premium, shares need to be over $572.80 for OP to make a benefit... So if shares cost $570, it would have been cheaper for OP to buy them from the market, but if they cost $575 OP made a benefit, a tiny one not worth the risk IMO.

Note, many people have made a lot of money by trading calls that never got passed the strike price, so the strike is not everything, but no one is going to buy your expensive call if it's so far away from being achievable.

Selling a call is the opposite, in this case someone took a premium of $172.80 per share, so $17 280 per contract, to later sell shares to OP at $400 per share. They're getting the money right away, and either are betting on the shares not reaching that price by expiration time, or just think they can do better with money right now. Their shares are locked though, so they won't be able to do anything with them until the contract expires, which can get annoying, if they change their mind and want to sell right away after all. You can definitely sell calls that you expect to end worthless simply to use that money to buy more of the shares.

If you get that, we can cover puts next.

2021-04-13 04:36:25,wallstreetbets,"Just to add to your last point, the seller can buy back from the market to close the contract. If they sold it at 172.80, at some point it might had been worth 100 bucks, for example, he can then buy it for 100 bucks, and keep the 72.80. This part is very useful for the wheel strategy"

2021-04-13 05:56:29,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre literally the first person on this entire fuckin sub to explain that in detail and for me to finally understand calls. Wow. It‚Äôs been a good year of research, asking for help and you come along and just nail it on the head. 

Thank you for the dumb explanation. You the man"
2021-04-13 05:35:05,wallstreetbets,"Dude, this was the best breakdown of options I've yet seen. Thank you so much for making this understandable. I still don't understand entirely but I've been left super confused after trying to watch youtube tutorials or read online, and NOBODY can seem to explain how options work in simple terms."
2021-04-13 06:22:05,wallstreetbets,"What I dawn from all this is that this is pretty much gambling with a ton of extra steps.

Is the premium price of $172.80 not excessive? I thought premiums were like $2 to $5, not **this** high. 

In all honesty, OP is a friggin crazy for having put so much on such a high price point.

What I've learned in the last few years is that fads pretty much only go up 20-30% once they hit the MSM. When I first heard of GME and AMC on the news, I decided to buy and then dumped it after it would hit that mark, but because I did it much earlier than I would've in the past and the stock went up even faster, I ended up doubling my investment and then the second I saw it start to go down, I dumped and then both nosedived. 

I'll do the same shit the next time I see any herd mentality investment on the news from now on and dump at 30%. It's been so damn consistent from everything that I've seen so far. Usually it takes about a week for the fad to die.

I still think GME has fuel to run on, but I'll only buy again if it goes double digits.

I know this is not what this sub likes, but I'm pretty sure it's going to keep going down or hover around where it has been in the last week with a few changes, but the risk of it going under double-digits, to me, is pretty high. People won't see an opportunity until it starts to go up again significantly."
2021-04-13 05:00:02,wallstreetbets,"Sorry if I sound daft, you mention that when someone sells calls that the shares under contract are locked... so to sell calls does one have to own the promised shares? How about puts, does the seller have to own the shares to be able to sell puts as well?

Also, how can you tell that the strike price on these contracts is 400$ and why is it necessary for the stock to reach that price before the contract can be exercised? Why would someone want to exercise this contract regardless?"
2021-04-13 05:03:09,wallstreetbets,"I have had a hard time understanding options, but this explanation helped me figure some things out. I think I‚Äôm ready for my first yolo.

Look for low premiums and sell the option before I lose all my money if thing go tits up, that‚Äôs the gist? 

A month from now I‚Äôll be the ü¶ç influencing the next ü¶ç to lose 80,000+üçå"
2021-04-13 05:17:01,wallstreetbets,"Thank you so much, almost no one here takes the time to explain this stuff in detail."

2021-04-13 04:13:25,wallstreetbets,"So in this case (assuming a $400 strike price like some others have mentioned), this guy has the right to buy the stock at $400 on the given date? Which is obv worthless since you can buy it at market value for way less?"

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Big oil play - part 4 I‚Äôve gotten a lot of requests for my views on the play with everything that‚Äôs happening in the world.

One word: bullish

We had a slight delay due to Europe covid, but the play is still strong.

Why?

US production is about to drop an additional 1-2mbd by the end of the year due to legacy declines in the various shale patches.

I also anticipate another 2-3mbd of declines from conventional wells in the opec and non opec nations due to underinvestment/damage from the shut ins.

The market believes that there is roughly 100mbd of production waiting for when the economy rips later this year. The problem is that there is realistically somewhere between 94-96mbd actually available.

The market will figure this out sometime this summer and shit will get real.

On top of that, BP, XOM, RDS, etc have all hinted at massive earnings incoming. 

Earnings are possibly the signal for them to rip higher.

Here are my current positions:

2675 BP $35 1/22 c
300 XOM $55 1/23 c
300 RDSA $60 1/22 c

This is not investment advice. I just like these stocks."

You checked-out $ET with its $18 Morningstar price target and insanely cheap fall and 1/22 calls, OP?

Midstream, but a decent undervalued co that got the snot beat out of it due to politics and bad press.

Insanely cheap OTM calls.

I‚Äôm in heavy in oil *services* as well (not as price-sensitive, but more volume).

Think $SLB is a deal there‚Äîmany feel services have about bottomed. $OIH a terrific and safe oil services ETF too that can easily double with $80/bbl wti for a couple months

For producers/exploration, check $FANG and $EOG when wti starts to rise.

Averaged down heavily when they were even bigger bargains at rock bottom and am up considerably on both. Most of this quarter the Brent oil price has been similar to what it was pre Covid, so I'm expecting decent earnings, especially BP as Shell were hit a bit by Texas freeze. 

Yeah I'm very bullish on oil due mainly to the permanent drop in Shale production, limited capex all over the world and I think we haven't seen peak demand yet even though green retards called it as 2019. Triple digit oil prices will be here soon. Also added GKP as they are literally the most undervalued producer on the planet although risky jurisdiction. 800M barrels of reserves, 55k bopd, and about $100M in cash and they are only valued at around ¬£350M.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My Trading Plan Template That Made Me Consistently Profitable \*EDIT: added screenshot of one of my portfolios\*

&#x200B;

[Screenshot of one of my portfolios](https://preview.redd.it/izffn53j4vs61.png?width=1835&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eeac0d1018d50149561d986f02d6152bf77f25a)

&#x200B;

In my trading career beyond having a strategy (actually multiple depending on market state and asset class) to base my trades on nothing has ever been as important as having a Trading plan. In this post I want to share with you my personal trading plan to help you create a set of rules that will help you stick to your plan and keep your emotions in check so that you can actually follow your trading strategy and become a consistently profitable trader.

Something that was and still is key for me is the following realization:

Never get attached to your opinion or view of why something should happen. The market is in fact always right and based on nothing but irrationality since its made by humans so the movements of the market do not have to make sense and at more times than not will not make sense.

Trading is simply a mind game. Markets are a result of mass psychology which leads to exploitable edges. Mastering your own psychology is key to keep following the strategy that defines your edge.

So now without further ado my trading plan template that has helped me so much over the years and I hope will help you as well:

**\*\*General Rules\*\***

1. Never enter a trade without a plan (TP,SL)
2. Once you are in a trade stick to the plan
3. Its ok to be wrong its not about being right its about making money
4. Be patient do not act on FOMO
5. Do not chase the market
6. Let your winners run and cut your losses short

**\*\*The 5 fundamental truths\*\***

1. Anything can happen.
2. You don't need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money.
3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge.
4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another.
5. Every moment in the market is unique.

**\*\*Rules of consistency\*\*I AM A CONSISTENT WINNER BECAUSE:**

1. I objectively identify my edges.
2. I have predefined risk of every trade.
3. I completely accept risk or I am willing to let go of the trade.
4. I act on my edges without reservation or hesitation.
5. I pay myself as the market makes money available to me.
6. I continually monitor my susceptibility for making errors.
7. I understand the absolute necessity of these principles of consistent success and, therefore, I never violate them.

**\*\*Risk and Money Management\*\***

Do not increase the standard trade size before you doubled the account.

1. The maximum amount you are allowed to lose in a day is $XXX.

¬†2. The maximum amount you are allowed to lose on any single trade is $XXX.

¬†3. The maximum number of losing trades in a row you are allowed to have in a day before you stop trading is two.¬†

4. The maximum number of losing trades you are allowed to have in a day before you stop trading is five. (You may have had a win or two between losses, but there is a time to stop trading.)¬†The maximum number of losing trades in the same direction you are allowed to take in a day before you stop trading is three.

¬†1. If you are up $XXX on a single trade, you will put a profit floor of $XXX underneath the current price to protect a portion of those profits.¬†

2. If you are up $XXX on a single trade, you will take the money and close out the trade.

¬†3. If you are up $XXX for the day, you will take the rest of the day off, stay away from the trading screens, and do something you enjoy doing‚Äîother than trading

4. If you are up $XXX for the month, you will put a profit floor of $XXX underneath the month's profits to protect a portion of those profits.¬†If you are up $XXX for the month, you will take the rest of the month off, stay away from the trading screens, and do something you enjoy doing‚Äîother than trading! Take a vacation, sleep late and read books, or do something else fun.

I created this trading plan years ago and am only sharing it with the community now (never spent much time on social media). It is a mix of my own ideas, ideas from fellow traders and books I have read over the years. One book in particular that I highly recommend and that has hugely influenced my trading plan and journey as a trader is: Trading In The Zone from Mark Douglas."

2021-04-13 05:30:48,wallstreetbets,"The biggest issue with this that you don't point out...

You have millions.  People who only have thousands can't do what you do.  Your want to treat yourself to a new car, you pull out 5% of your *profits* to pay for it.  Someone without that money wants to treat themselves to a new car, they would need to pull out *everything* and then they'd have nothing.  You want to sell covered calls?  You can make a killing on selling Amazon or Tesla CCs each week.  Someone with a couple thousand wants to sell CCs?  They are pushed into a much lower value stock where they either have to go all in on something like GE or F (if they want something they can be confident in at the very least) or they sell CCs on some trash stock or diversify with unproven penny stocks that barely pay premiums on theta.  Would you willingly go all in on a penny stock to sell CCs on hopes of your money growing there?  Or would you consider that too risky?

You're consistently profitable partially because you have solid fundamentals that you work with, but you *also have a large initial sum of money*.  That's the key that makes it work.  Yeah, being stupid with a lot of money will lose a lot of money, we've seen that plenty here.  But many people here just don't have that money to start with.  If they just follow your percentages, they still can't be as successful as you because a 50% gain over a year on $1000 is still only $500, that's money that someone like you can make in a few hours easily.

I'm not saying your fundamentals are wrong.  You're smart.  You're playing the market intelligently.  You're doing things right.  It's just that you're telling tons of people who don't have the initial start that you have to work with that they're just doing it wrong.  They can't create any kind of success doing it your way unless they suddenly get wealthy enough on some big play first.  And that's why they go for the big plays.

2% a year on $10m will pay for a comfortable life living solely on profits (160k per year after taxes), and that's without taking a penny out of the initial investment.  2% a year on $10k only gives you $160 after taxes for the year.  It would take several lifetimes to turn that $10k into $10m at 2% per year.  And that's just to finally reach a point where you will live on the same profits.

You see the difference?"
2021-04-13 00:18:40,wallstreetbets,Buy more GME and hold. Got it.
2021-04-13 06:43:14,wallstreetbets,You jerked me off and then walked away before I finished - your post is great but isn't the most important thing talking about what your 'edge' is and how you make your trading decisions?

2021-04-13 00:33:19,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate the post. 

I‚Äôve heard many times about cutting losers. 


I have made some recent mistakes shifting my assets at the all time highs. Took a 20% hit no more than 2 weeks after. 

While most of my assets are now within reach of being green,  a few leaps have been hurting. I presume because they are now OTM and have low delta. 

Specifically my ARKK Call at 135strike. Even though it expires in 2 years, it is -50% right now.  I constantly debate whether I should DCA or cut my losses. The reason why I‚Äôm leaning towards DCA is because I still believe in the stocks within the etf and want Tesla exposure. 

Is there some insight you may have on this predicament?"

2021-04-13 09:27:24,wallstreetbets,"I mean - you're not wrong. Its way easier to make more money when you have a larger initial pile.  

But these rules (I recognize a lot of the principles from Mark Douglas) - are about generating consistent profits. Yeah, starting with $10k you aren't going to get to life-changing money in a year like you might with YOLOs and FD lottos - but if you can grow that consistently 20% ARR over the year, then you start the next year with $12k, and more discipline, and a (hopefully) stronger system, so maybe you do a bit better - maybe 30%. Or the market changes on you, invalidating your system, and you do a bit worse.

The point is - this is the most reliable way to wealth accumulation. It's not going to get you to F-U money for years (if you are starting small), but it gives you a better chance than gambling on meme stocks.  Doesn't mean you can't get lucky on meme stocks & YOLOs (plenty of people here have), but it's going to be really difficult to do that consistently - which means, if you don't have a disciplined system (or you don't just quit after your first big win), you're probably going to eventually lose it all gambling here.

(FWIW - I don't have a great system and I'm still gambling here, hoping to get to that F-U money level, and THEN I'll start to get smart about how I trade & manage risk. At least, that's what I tell myself üòâ)"

2021-04-13 00:06:17,wallstreetbets,sorry had a typo in there with two vs three. Its about switching bias. When you continue to trade in the same direction sticking to your thesis even though the market is telling you otherwise its a bad thing. Latest after the market has proven you wrong two times your thesis should be invalidated and you should switch bias.
2021-04-13 00:37:31,wallstreetbets,It really largely depends on your investment thesis. If you have valid reasons to believe that ARKK will be going up over the next to years then stick with it and use the lower prices DCA. If however your investment thesis has been invalidated cut your losses.
2021-04-13 00:44:07,wallstreetbets,it is thats the whole point ;) Money management is coming from game theory and was made popular by professional gamblers. If you play the markets like they play the casinos you are already way ahead of the herd.
2021-04-13 06:36:17,wallstreetbets,Keep pulling your stop loss further and further into the profit so you never give up to much of your profits again. Its always a balance between giving the trade enough room to run vs not giving it too much. It largely comes down to your investment thesis and time horizon. Vuzix for example I am in for the long run as the industry is just getting started so I have my stop loss only barely above break even giving it a lot of room to run.

2021-04-13 11:17:06,wallstreetbets,Setting the SL according to the risk reward ratio you are going for is what defines your risk and you need to match it with your investment thesis. If you believe any asset is going to go up for whatever reason there will always be a point where your thesis will be invalidated. Ideally you match this with your SL. It is about finding entries that have a good risk reward ratio. I only trade trending markets and usually in the direction of the trend. So I will be looking for a pullback that does not break the trend and enter on that pullback. I put my SL at or near the point where this thesis would be invalidated by actually breaking the trend and switching bias. This way I have a predefined risk in terms of amount of money I am willing to lose to figure out if my thesis was right and the trade will work out.

2021-04-13 00:59:45,wallstreetbets,"I have been waiting for this response for months, and today was the day I read it here on this fine memestonks board"
2021-04-13 17:32:50,wallstreetbets,"You're right, and I never said his system is invalidated.  I'm simply pointing out that it works so much better the more wealth that is started with.

Someone starting with just 5k and pulling off 20% per year (that's kinda huge) only makes $800 after taxes, assuming this was through trading and not through an investment that is held.  The end of the first year shows $5800 in the account, nothing withdrawn for self reward, only taxes.  The second year shows around $6700, with again no self reward and only paying taxes. After 5 years, the account value is right around $10.3k after taxes.  5 years, not a single withdrawn penny to treat yourself.  Didn't his post say to pull some profits out here and there for that purpose?

Well, let's pull out enough to get a new $1000 laptop.  After all, you need a better system, it's been 5 years, and you're spending that money investing in a machine to help you do your trading better, right?  Well that $1000 withdrawal is approximately the last 9+ months in gains gone.  The next 6 months of trading is solely to get your account back to where it was to cover the cost of that laptop.  If you make another purchase next year, there goes even more progress.

Let's say that you *don't* treat yourself to anything with your profits.  5 years at 20% gains per year (again, you're a fucking trading prodigy to consistently pull this shit off with lower account balance and being unable to get the big stuff) just to get to 10k from 5k.  5 more years to get to 20k.  At around 20+ years in, you finally have $100k.  You could pull everything out and get a house!  ... Except property costs have gone up in 20 years now and you need twice as much compared to 20 years ago, aka today.  So you go for *another* 5 years.  Oh well, 25 years total and you get your house finally.  And now you have almost nothing in your account again because you just treated yourself to a house.  Yeah, it was fully paid off, but now you're back to nothing again.

And remember, this is $5k turned into a house in 25 years without ever pulling a penny out to get yourself something nice.  25 years.  In the meantime, someone who starts with the money to buy a house can make enough to buy a house and still have the initial investment left over while paying themselves periodically over the course of 10 years.

This is the difference.  This is why it doesn't quite work the way the people with the money think it works for the people without the money.  Do you think that someone used to wealth can pull off not touching the account to buy something nice for 25 years just to be able to keep growing at a decent rate?  They're paying themselves periodically, but people with less *literally can't* otherwise they massively lengthen the amount of time it takes to finally reach goals.

Just taking out $500 each year on that $5k investment growing at 20% per year will mean that the amount of time it takes to reach $10k will be approximately 10-15 years.  It starts being far less of an impact the further time goes on, but it's huge in the beginning.  $500 withdrawn on a $100k account doesn't impact much of anything, but it kills a $5k account.

I'm just trying to point these things out.  Nothing more.  OPs strategy isn't bad.  It's great actually.  It just doesn't work for many people here.  Believe it or not, many of us are more than intelligent enough to know *how* to consistently build wealth like this, but just *can't* in any kind of timely manner because we'll be too old or dead by the time we finally have enough to do what we want with it.  So people here YOLO and have some fun with it instead.

And I'll support them as a friend for it even though I won't participate in their 100% YOLOs myself because at the very least, *I understand*."
2021-04-13 08:43:10,wallstreetbets,"Less than 100k as in 5 grand? Or let‚Äôs be honest here, less than $100k could mean $75-80k which is like two whole years salary after taxes for the average American. 

That‚Äôs not almost nothing.  That‚Äôs a HUGE amount of money."
2021-04-13 16:59:56,wallstreetbets,"And do you genuinely think that people with just a few thousand can turn it into something that grows on itself enough in a timely manner using your proven advice?  Or do you think that ""less than 100k"" from ten years ago (what were the best stocks priced at back then compared to now in comparison?) is enough to accomplish the same thing that ""less than 100k"" can do right now?

Again, I'm not saying that you're full of shit.  I fully agree that the advice that you're giving is smart and it's what people should follow to make money grow.  The issue is just that the small guys can't do a fraction of what you can do, and you're talking to a lot of small guys in the market.  We can't exactly expect that 8% of our portfolio in AMZN for 0.0420% of a share is going to take off and turn into 100 on a stock split eventually that we can sell CCs on in the future, we'd be dead before that ever happened."

I agree with a lot of her research, although some of it looks to be a bit exaggerated (Tesla thesis). Many of the stocks in the etf are stocks I‚Äôd want to hold on to long term so I thought it was a slam dunk. 

I‚Äôve been getting into more wheel type activities and even wanted to start delving into some leaps with PMCCs of companies I‚Äôd want to hold long term (think Microsoft,apple, NVIDIA, ) and some index funds. 

Right now it‚Äôs just a war torn portfolios with a sea of red and a splattering of green (thanks apple).

If you think it will rebound, then start selling \~10% OTM cc weeklies and start to whittle away at that cost basis. It's gonna take a long time to make a significant dent, but if you still believe in your thesis then diamond hand that bitch and take the small returns while you wait. This is slightly riskier with WSB meme stocks as they tend to have bigger swings so 10% may not be enough.

If you think it's a shitter, then dump it and buy something nicer. Don't wait if you don't think it'll rebound."

2021-04-13 02:57:11,wallstreetbets,"Here in my garage, just bought this new Lamborghini here. It‚Äôs fun to drive up here in the Hollywood hills. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Knowledge. In fact, I‚Äôm a lot more proud of these seven new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold two thousand new books that I bought. It‚Äôs like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, ‚Äúthe more you learn, the more you earn.‚Äù

Now maybe you‚Äôve seen my TEDx talk where I talk about how I read a book a day. You know, I read a book a day not to show off it‚Äôs again about the knowledge. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it‚Äôs a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn‚Äôt that long ago that I was in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven dollars in my bank account. I didn‚Äôt have a college degree, I had no opportunities.

But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a mentor. And another mentor. And a few more mentors. I found five mentors. And they showed me what they did to become multimillionaires. Again, it‚Äôs not just about money, it‚Äôs about the good life; health, wealth, love and happiness. And so I record a little video, it‚Äôs actually on my website, you can click here on this video and it‚Äôll take you to my website where I share three things that they taught me. Three things that you can implement today no matter where you are.

Now, this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù scheme. You know, like they say if things sound too good to be true they are too good to be true. I‚Äôm not promising you that tomorrow you‚Äôre gonna be able to go out and buy a Lamborghini. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven steps. So, I record a little two minute video on my website. Like I said, now it‚Äôs not the most professional I just shot it here with my iPhone, but it‚Äôs real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And I‚Äôm going to give you the three most important things you can do today. So click the link, go there it‚Äôs completely free to watch it it‚Äôs just a couple minutes. Invest in yourself. Always be curious. Don‚Äôt be a cynic. Okay, people see videos like this and they say ‚ÄúAh that‚Äôs not real that‚Äôs for somebody else.‚Äù

Don‚Äôt listen, don‚Äôt listen. Be an optimist. Like, Conrad Hilton, the man who started Hilton Hotel, he said that he was only fifteen years old when he read a book by Helen Keller, and that book changed his life. Books can change your life. And in that book, Helen Keller said ‚Äúoptimism‚Äù so if you‚Äôre a cynic, if you‚Äôre a pessimist you don‚Äôt need to click here. Don‚Äôt worry about it, I don‚Äôt need to talk to everybody. But if you‚Äôre somebody who knows that there‚Äôs something better, cause the dream is possible, you know, for some of you watching it‚Äôs not necessarily a Lamborghini, maybe it‚Äôs a new job, a new opportunity, starting your own company.

Maybe it‚Äôs a new lifestyle without so much stress, traveling the world, doing those things you know you‚Äôre destined to do. You can do those unless you understand finances. Money, I don‚Äôt call it money anymore, I call it fuel units. You must have enough fuel units to live out your dream and to live out your destiny. So, I‚Äôll see you on my website, it‚Äôs a quick video and you‚Äôll see there absolutely free.

So just click this video and you‚Äôll be taken there in a second, and uh, I‚Äôm excited to share this amazing stuff. You‚Äôll see, not because of anything of me but because I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to learn from mentors many years ahead of me. Not just in books like these, although I love books but also real in-person mentors. So let me share with you these three tips that have made all the difference in my life. They‚Äôre practical, you can do them today, you can start on them today. All right? See you there on my site."

&#x200B;

Hey Guys!

edit: New format for legibility, it was a mess.

**I was reading about:**

The IEX (Investors Exchange): [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEX), this exchange purports to be an exchange that is friendly to retail investors.

""IEX's main innovation is a 38-mile (61¬†km) coil of [optical fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber)placed  in front of its trading engine. This 350 microsecond delay  adds  a   round-trip delay of 0.0007 seconds and is designed to negate  the    certain speed advantages utilized by some high-frequency traders.""

Additionally they created the D-Limit Order to fight High Frequency Traders.

[https://iextrading.com/alerts/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjkUf1YX2kUVNxyJ9ED4TMT-MwhzOcEl1yFsggqUlbU1ZC3WDQDMFsgaAtuMEALw\_wcB#/121](https://iextrading.com/alerts/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw38-DBhDpARIsADJ3kjkUf1YX2kUVNxyJ9ED4TMT-MwhzOcEl1yFsggqUlbU1ZC3WDQDMFsgaAtuMEALw_wcB#/121)

&#x200B;

**The possible DFV references:**

On March 26th DFV made a few tweets that didn't seem to make sense.

DFV tweeted Flash Gordon a possible reference to the IEX as detailed in [*Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Boys:_A_Wall_Street_Revolt) by Michael Lewis.

DFV tweeted a cat slapping a drone, which is a possible reference to fighting the robotic or Trading Algos.

&#x200B;

*Thanks to* [*u/TabrisSeele*](https://www.reddit.com/u/TabrisSeele/)  *for contributed this link:* [*https://iextrading.com/trading/*](https://iextrading.com/trading/)*, it lists brokerages that will send trades to them.*

***Common Question:***  ""Hey how come I see Citadel listed on IEX's website?""

IEX  is an exchange, like the NYSE, people trade there.  It doesn't make  sense for Citadel to limit who they trade with, but they will have a  disadvantage when trading there due to the ""Speed Bump"" time delay.

&#x200B;

*Contributed by* [u/OG\_simple\_rhyme\_time](https://www.reddit.com/user/OG_simple_rhyme_time)

*This is from an article from one of the DDs from yesterday that appeared in 2015, who knows how bad its got since then:*

*""In  Connect, Citadel makes active retail orders it has bought from  retail  brokerages available to institutional investors and other firms.*

*Very  few stock orders that retail investors place with their brokers,  such  as Charles Schwab Corp, TD Ameritrade, or Fidelity, go through  public  stock exchanges, such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc‚Äôs New York  Stock  Exchange. Instead, the brokers send the orders to other brokerage   firms like Citadel, or KCG Holdings, which trade against the incoming   orders, and then send the leftovers to other internalizers, dark pools,   or as a last resort, exchanges.*

*By  doing this, the retail brokers not only avoid paying fees to the   exchanges for active orders, but actually receive payments and trading   rebates from the off-exchange trading venues.""*

*All the brokers we think are clean, are doing all of retail very dirty. GLE*

&#x200B;

**How to route orders to a different exchange:**

Seems even routing to NYSE or ARCA directly is better than the default for many brokers who use Dark Pools/Citadel as a standard.

If you don't have a brokerage that will allow routing **DON'T PANIC.**  It is not necessary for people to switch, no broker is perfect (I see your Dark Pool Fidelity!).  Stay where you are, the squeeze will happen or not.  This post was more about **AWARENESS**  of the options you may have when placing trades in the stock market.

&#x200B;

**ETrade Pro**

This is how I change it in ETrade Pro.  I cannot find a way to change it  using the WebPortal or Power ETrade.  It looks like it is locked behind  Pro account requirements.

**TD Ameritrade**

*Contributed by* [*u/loldavelol*](https://www.reddit.com/u/loldavelol/)

*TDAmeritrade offers Direct Order   Routing to the Exchanges. ""Direct Routing,"" as TDA calls it, allows you   to select a routing destination for your stock or options order.*

***It is a feature that must be enabled. It is disabled by default.***

*When disabled, all orders on TDA are submitted via* [*\[""Smart Routing""\]*](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/order-execution.page)*, listed at the bottom of the page:*

>*Execution quality statistics provided by S3 Matching Technologies*

*Which, if is the same S3 that reports SI, was recently learned to be owned by Citadel* [*\[1\]*](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/me2xrj/the_s3_partners_ownership_rabbithole/) *&* [*\[2\]*](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mo2811/let_me_tell_you_the_tale_of_s3_partners_a/)

*Once   Direct Routing is Enabled, this allows users to circumvent Kenny G  from  poaching orders by routing orders directly to the exchange floor  via  IEX, instead of through Citadel and NYSE/ARCA.*

*The downsides:*

* *Orders may not get the best pricing (pennies on the share, TDA quotes savings $1.27 per 100 shares)*
* *Might be more susceptible to partial fills (IE: $135 for 10 might fill for 3 until 7 more are found).*
* *IEX is also only available during regular market hours, so no access to AM/PM trading.*

*Unfortunately, on TDA, IEX orders have to be submitted from the Stock Buy/Sell Screen and cant be routed from SnapTicket.*

***Conclusion:***

*If GME buyers started routing orders from their brokers through IEX then we would* *~~apply massive buying pressure to the share price away from the NYSE flow that Citadel Controls~~* *bypass Citadel as the MM.*

*Bonus, Citadel sued the SEC after approving IEX as a pathway to the stock market.* [*\[1\]*](https://www.google.com/search?q=citadel+iex&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS821US821&oq=&aqs=chrome.2.69i59i450l8.564081j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

>*‚ÄúThe   SEC failed to properly consider the costs and burdens imposed by this   proposal that will undermine the reliability of our markets and harm   tens of millions of retail investors,‚Äù a Citadel Securities spokeswoman   said in an email on Friday.*

*Sounds like IEX is a threat to Citadel's position as an NYSE DMM.*

*Contributed by* [*u/myco\_mage*](https://www.reddit.com/user/myco_mage)

*I got my direct routing for equities on TD Ameritrade working. I guess I  wasn't allowed to do it because I had something called ""advanced  features"" activated The way you can tell is by going to client  services>general>elections and routing And if you don't see a  setting called ""contingency triggers"" under forex you have advanced  features enabled. Contact TDA to get them removed*

*Even with direct routing of equities enabled you won't be able to pick  your exchange on the think or swim mobile app, choosing your exchange is  limited to the basic TD Ameritrade app or the think or swim desktop  application*

**TD DI** *Contributed by* [u/aholl50](https://www.reddit.com/user/aholl50)

*Hey so I looked into TD  Direct Investing (TD DI) for Canadian apes using TD Canada Trust and it  seems all US-listed equities are routed through the TD Ameritrade arm  and are subject to TDA default best execution protocol. Unfortunately, I  cannot find any information on WebBroker for choosing a different  exchange when buying using TD DI. Seems like Canadian apes using TD DI  don't have the option of switching exchanges in this case, hoping others  can keep digging and find more info or a potential alternative versus  switching brokers.*

*Sources: (*[*https://www.td.com/ca/en/investing/documents/pdf/direct-investing/client-disclosure-best-execution-and-fair-pricing\_EN.pdf*](https://www.td.com/ca/en/investing/documents/pdf/direct-investing/client-disclosure-best-execution-and-fair-pricing_EN.pdf)*)  page 5 covers US Equities this then points me to this TDA document which confirms the above info  regarding the need for opting in to direct routing as described (*[*https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en\_us/resources/pdf/TDA100533.pdf*](https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA100533.pdf)*)*

2021-04-13 14:46:08,wallstreetbets,"IEX does indeed have a mile of fibre that introduces microseconds of latency. It's ridiculous. They could have done it in software on their network hardware. But the fibre is better for news articles.

Anyway, it does what it purports to do. It slows things down.

But if HFTs still have a dozen other places to do their dirty tricks, IEX hardly makes a difference. Wish it were different, but that's the way it is.

Routing your orders to IEX is a way to support the exchange. They make money from each fill.

In IBKR if you switch from SMART routing to IEX you're not guaranteed the best price. SMART might send your order to an ECN (""dark pool"") but only if it offers price improvement."

2021-04-13 04:50:27,wallstreetbets,"Not really sure why there was any need for all the conspiracy theory in OP.

This deserves and needs to blow up. Enough people leaving T212 may encourage them to adopt as a feature.

My request:
1)Please route my Buy Orders to IEX exchange

T212 response:
1) That option not available yet.
2) Submitted as a request.
3) Cannot provide an ETA for approval

2021-04-13 10:05:20,wallstreetbets,"They put no pressure on the open market.

Citadel was using this to their advantage yesterday: send all buy orders to be filled in a dark pool and send all sell orders to the open market.

The open market then thinks there's only sell orders and no buy orders, so the price drops significantly faster, when in reality that isn't true."
2021-04-13 10:22:32,wallstreetbets,I'm also interested to know
2021-04-13 12:53:32,wallstreetbets,Say what?
2021-04-13 11:35:34,wallstreetbets,"IEX is an exchange, it doesn't make sense for them not to take trades on all exchanges, but they will have a disadvantage due to the ""speed bump"""

2021-04-13 12:25:59,wallstreetbets,Cool
2021-04-13 12:55:15,wallstreetbets,I think it was innocent at that point.  Fidelity was just one of the only brokerages that didn't restrict trading in GME.  They are big and independent so they didn't get forced to by Citadel.  Doesn't mean they don't have their own problems.

2021-04-13 13:10:18,wallstreetbets,"Good to hear, I think they might be better if more people used the exchange.  Seems they may be prone to half filled orders, which could just be because not many route through them."
2021-04-13 13:11:45,wallstreetbets,I did write it in the context of GME.  You are right that the issue is broader though.  Dark Pools are used in general to manipulate trades and choosing to route outside of them can help protect your investment.
2021-04-13 13:42:51,wallstreetbets,Not sure why I would want that.
2021-04-13 07:40:16,wallstreetbets,Welcome

2021-04-13 08:35:49,wallstreetbets,"Yes, IEX is an exchange, like the NYSE, it's where orders go to be filled.  Why would Citadel and co, not trade there?  They just don't get as much of an advantage due to the intentional delay."
2021-04-12 22:29:34,wallstreetbets,More than you think.
2021-04-12 22:25:08,wallstreetbets,"I bought more last Friday.

Also if it's true that GME buy orders are being routed to the Dark Pool, then that is why our buying is having no effect on the price."
2021-04-13 07:38:56,wallstreetbets,I feel fine lol.
2021-04-13 04:21:44,wallstreetbets,"People have speculated on his tweets as long as he's been making them.

Even if that wasn't what he meant, using IEX isn't a bad move, they aim to level the playing field for retail.  It's their mandate."

2021-04-13 11:27:54,wallstreetbets,"Cashapp sucks. I was on it for a while because of the convenience. I wrote to support to ask how to transfer my shares to Fidelity, to find out who the brokerage was (it's listed as a Cashapp owned brokerage, but I don't know why it's called something like DriveWealth), and the response about whether my shares were on margin seemed to be a ""yeah, probably"". If you transfer out, you can never trade on Cashapp again (oh no!!).

That's all I've got for you, though. Wish I could be of more help."

I don't recall who did it, but someone took advantage of the fact that the speed of light through air is faster than the speed of light through fiber optic cable and setup a chain of line-of-sight towers with microwave transmitters all the way from NYC to Chicago.  A signal to update a price goes faster through the towers than through the cables that actual market infrastructure uses, leading to zero-risk arbitrage.  Just generates automatic money no matter what happens."

2021-04-12 22:45:20,wallstreetbets,"This is a pretty good article: https://iextrading.com/about/press/op-ed/

You can also read this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/22moq9/iex_speed_bump/

TL;DR: IEX imposes a 350 microsecond delay on all orders (a speed bump if you will) that is supposed to prevent scalping / latency arbitrage.

It's a pretty fascinating rabbit hole to go down IMO."
2021-04-13 07:44:56,wallstreetbets,"Watch the hummingbird project movie.  HFT are able to do what they do if they have the quickest path possible to sending information to exchanges. That's why trillions of dollars in trades are actually in NJ and not on Wall street.  The IEX levels the playing field for everyone because it coils wires to its exchange thereby negating any advantage HFT have for simply having a fast computer/connection. IEX essentially just artificially increases the distance of sending information to its exchange. 

You can see the fuckery with HFT. Ever try sending a limit order in for an option right at the midpoint of the spread and not see it fill and see the spread instantly change when you hit the send order button?  That's HFT eating up the contracts available because they can see your order and cut in front of you to grab any available option for the limit price you set.  That means the bid ask increases and the Hft profit off the increased spread and you get fucked having to pay more.  At the IEX, the power of HFT to do that is basically negated because the IEX has slowed them down."

If you're going to get a better price on the exchange (I e: if the exchange's price has somehow been artificially suppressed) then your order goes there (if your broker isn't ass). Price pressure gets distributed between the two, you can't route all buys to one and all sells to the other (ignoring the fact that you literally can't do this because every trade needs one of each) to manipulate it because everybody else will see the better deal on the exchange and route it there instead."

2021-04-13 13:37:33,wallstreetbets,"Trader here, fulltime. Partial fills happen on all exchanges and ECNs, it's in no way specific to IEX. IEX also sends orders to other exchanges if they don't have a matching order in a given timeframe."
2021-04-13 14:33:26,wallstreetbets,This applies to every retail investment. I was referring to GME not being in title.
2021-04-13 09:00:28,wallstreetbets,"Their default routes through their own dark pool BLOX, which specifically bans predatory HFTs.  You‚Äôre making a broad assumption that Fidelity is automatically screwing you by using a dark pool but they‚Äôre preventing HFTs from front running and possibly giving price improvement by executing at the mid point.  There‚Äôs more nuance than just ‚Äúdark pools bad‚Äù."
2021-04-12 22:42:23,wallstreetbets,He can talk to people.  He is probably limited to. some extent due to his legal issues.  His lawyer probably told him to limit his public comments.  That being said it won't benefit you to go around trying to read tea leaves.  It is a fool's errand.
2021-04-13 16:56:22,wallstreetbets,"If he were being investigated his lawyers would tell him not to post pictures of his position dashboard and how many options he has, or a poll asking him if he should exercise them."
2021-04-13 07:49:00,wallstreetbets,Can you please take a quick look at my post and maybe give me some feedback here?
2021-04-12 22:35:43,wallstreetbets,"I have to ask, but have you actually paid attention to anything outside the gme posts and threads? gme positive consensus in general is rapidly declining. negative opinions used to be non existent or immediately downvoted to hell. now I'm starting to see actually discussions about how the poor gme apes are basically a cult of idiots being taken advantage of by the hedgefunds they think they are fighting. Now those discussions dont matter of course, the only thing that matters is that the trend is changing.  also, I highly doubt the price would be as volatile as it is if everyone was ""diamond handing"" to their grave like yall claim you are."
2021-04-12 22:59:02,wallstreetbets,No. Trading in dark pools ‚Äúeffects the price.‚Äù Dark pool trades print on the consolidated tape. You guys have a different conspiracy theory every week.

2021-04-12 22:27:24,wallstreetbets,"good for you üëè hope your not to deep in the red.

also, you really think that all buy orders are being routed into the ether  as to prevent the price going up? if that's true then forget market manipulation and short laddering, you apes are fucked..."
2021-04-13 02:50:05,wallstreetbets,"The reason why the price is not going up is because when you look at the frickin Level 2 data, there are very few people buying and selling. The spike and dumps in middle of the day, is likely a big player buying shares and options and flipping them quickly trying to see if they can make a quick buck (perhaps hoping to get Apes to jump on board and buy driving the price up long enough for them to unload the shares and options at a profit... does not look like it worked much because apparently Apes are all broke and can't really buy more shares)."

2021-04-13 11:23:33,wallstreetbets,Not saying it was about better price. It was about preventing them from filling in the Dark Pool which doesn't affect market price.
2021-04-13 11:28:22,wallstreetbets,"This is the truth, unless HFTs are front running, where they determine a large order is coming and buy everything available and re-offer it at a higher price. Not a concern for retail investors placing small orders. But if an exchange is not giving you the NBBO then they are violating reg NMS and could get destroyed by the SEC."

edit: i had to go thru the TDA site (instead of the app) and put an order thru the stocks & ETFs page for it to show the routing option set to IEX, instead of using the buy/sell button on the GME page which just uses SnapTicket with Smart routing. hopefully someone else can chime in with a simpler method...?"

2021-04-13 13:42:19,wallstreetbets,"Sure, I wasn‚Äôt trying to suggest it was a unique thing.  I had read that the rate of partial fills was higher on IEX and was speculating it might be due to lower participation on that market.  I didn‚Äôt know about the cross orders."

I'm not so sure that dark pools with price discovery are contributing to any ""false pricing"" in the public markets.

Note that the MM's don't need dark pools to front run Robinhood traders. They use public exchanges, ECNs and dark pools to do that. They can even use IEX to front run Robinhood traders."

The people that scream about the land are the ones that dont get shit from the casinos the 1/1024 native blood... the ones making money do not care...

They are allowed to have casinos they make billions....

They do not care about the land... so stop speaking for them

Climate change is fake...... what we do on earth has a near zero effect...

Our Sun cycles Monderm Min/Max and the reversal of the poles and space weather has MORE to do with climate than ""green house"" gases..

Did you know that CO2 is healthy for the environment?

I'm assuming you still watch CNN fear porn huh?

The project was meant for US to have their natural resources strength back but now we have to Rely on IMPORTS WHICH IS WAY MORE EXPENSIVE

Compare how much imported gas is vs Pipeline....

2021-04-13 16:14:15,wallstreetbets,"Yup, GameStop has a few locations around Ireland. You?"

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I am buying UVXY box spreads. I know what you're thinking.

I have no money at risk. Pricing inefficiencies and differences allow me to make a fixed profit, no matter the direction of the stock. UVXY is a perfect choice for box spreads, as it has a predictable chart and steadily goes up as time passes.

I plan on buying 2 - 4k contracts that all expire 1 year from now.

It is 100% risk-free. I have no money at risk.

More info and proof will come soon. Feel free to leave your thoughts on this trade with me.

Edit: Some of you don't believe me. I will be posting proof tomorrow after I buy the spreads."

Please do this though and record the GUH"

And have you heard of assignment risk?

Gl.. this never works"
2021-04-12 21:45:09,wallstreetbets,WRONG - UVXY only goes down - it is a 3X declining fund - it slowly devalues - just check out a 5 Or 10 year chart - they keep reverse splitting - it occasionally spikes when the market gets spooked

2021-04-12 22:01:24,wallstreetbets,Lol I hope so. I think they are an underrated company that has potential for a big comeback.
2021-04-12 21:31:22,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs mainly because their huge billion dollar investments in China imploded with nobody in China wanting to buy a Ford. Then they released their electric versions that nobody is buying as well. So long term this company is headed for trouble.
2021-04-12 20:29:14,wallstreetbets,.
2021-04-12 20:32:16,wallstreetbets,I have seen quite a few around where I live.
2021-04-12 20:23:18,wallstreetbets,The demand is pretty high. I think the big thing that might screw things up is if they can‚Äôt get the chip shortage under control.
2021-04-12 21:27:24,wallstreetbets,No. It‚Äôs barley selling. If it was actually selling well they would be selling it $20k over sticker instead of offering discounts. Similar to how overpriced they sold the Raptor and Shelby after new releases.
2021-04-13 16:28:16,wallstreetbets,What are some of the selling points for the Mach E compared to a Tesla?  Maybe some people  like the body design more.  What else is there?  Serious question.
2021-04-13 04:03:10,wallstreetbets,Ending dividends is step one for any boomer stock to actually go up no need to pay out billions each quarter to have shareholders
2021-04-12 21:45:55,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not true. They were over $40 in the late 90s (Lol it‚Äôs definitely a long time ago). Not saying that‚Äôs an indicator of its potential but I‚Äôm betting on the Mach E eating into Tesla‚Äôs market cap and I suspect as chips come back Ford may have a shot at a massive comeback.
2021-04-13 01:52:53,wallstreetbets,The electric F150 might be a big winner but I‚Äôm not betting on it.

2021-04-12 20:43:01,wallstreetbets,They didn‚Äôt make their own chip?
2021-04-13 16:40:13,wallstreetbets,Mach E buyers will be able to get the Federal Tax credit. Can‚Äôt think of any other than that. I don‚Äôt like the fact that Ford make it 4 different trim to get the certain feature. I personally prefer Tesla due to nationwide superchargers and Autopilot.
2021-04-12 21:47:54,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-13 03:27:04,wallstreetbets,They will cost a fortune when first released and won't be affordable for many years after. I'd give it at least 8 years before the electric F150 can compete with the gas version.
2021-04-13 01:59:48,wallstreetbets,I dont think it'll be the saving grace. No manufacturer other than tesla has the ability to mass produce EV'S right now. Especially at the quality and reliability level you'd demand from a vehicle in that price range. Tesla ownes (or is heavily invested in) everything from pulling raw materials from the ground to battery manufacturing to sending the car to your door. Ford and other legacy autos have to outsource so much of that supply line.
2021-04-12 22:15:31,wallstreetbets,"^Psst
You in Louisville too?"
2021-04-12 20:44:07,wallstreetbets,Maybe some but they just shut down a factory because of the chip shortage. Idk if it impacted the Mach e though
2021-04-13 16:50:55,wallstreetbets,I wonder how the repair process is with the Mach E?  Seems that some people have a lengthy wait time with Tesla.  A little later down the road I‚Äôm sure this issue will be resolved.
2021-04-12 21:48:57,wallstreetbets,Ya but by that logic Tesla should be around $30 a share so I figure anything is possible
2021-04-12 22:26:28,wallstreetbets,You've never heard of a mustang?

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My Update on UWMC: The Equivalent of Counting Cards at the Blackjack Table Baby, or Why are ya'll tripping on this fine Stock? So, I wanted to wait a period of time before writing a update to my due diligence. Some of you might remember my last two due diligences. Well, I‚Äôm happy to say that I‚Äôve bought more. So, let‚Äôs actually get to the meat and potatoes.  If you want some theme music for how some of you people with a bad case of FUD who are holding UWMC are feeling I'd recommend Balduin & Wolfgang Lohr - Dizzy (ft. Alanna). Bonus points if you know the anime/light novel and get the meta meme within.

Please note that this is based on historical monthly median single family home values in the US, that the data is non-seasonally adjusted, and that it is based on sales of existing homes.

¬∑ The Median Home Price was $303,900 in January.

¬∑ The Median Home Price was $317,100 in February.

¬∑ In February, the supply of inventory ticked up by .1 to 2 Months indicating huge demand, and an extreme sellers-market, indicating that home prices will have increased when data in March 2021 is shed on the 25th.

If you would like to do some more research, you can find the NAR data here: [Housing Statistics (nar.realtor)](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics).

While it is true that existing home sales fell, it is not due to a bubble, but due to supply constraints and unrestrained demand. What you can be assured of however is five things, for Q1 of 2021:

1. On a seasonally adjusted basis, home sales have increased as you can see in the NAR data. Furthermore, the per home sale profit has increased due to month-on-month price increases. This is because originations usually cost .5-1% of a home‚Äôs value. With UWMC‚Äôs increasing margin due to its technology, gain margin should continue, and has been shown to have grown YoY.
2. UWMC has put out guidance of between $52 Billion and $57 of closed loan volume. Last quarter they had $54.7 Billion in 4Q20. On the Mad Money Interview with Cramer, the man said they were on track to land right around the middle of that. That provides, impetus for me to believe they will meet, or exceed guidance. They had Net Income of $1,001,925,000 after the impact of an estimated effective tax rate of 27% in Q4 of 2020. Total Gain Margin may be a little lower, as they are stating they will have a gain margin of 200-235 Basis Points, as opposed to 305 Basis Points in Q4 2020.
3. It is important to know that while they do refinance, their bread and butter is and always has been the purchase market. However, in 2020, however, they turned off FHA loans, and Jumbo loans out of an abundance of caution. This meant that while they made a massive $3.38 Billion in net income, their actual purchase volume decreased to $42.9 Billion, as compared to $49.8 Billion in total purchase volume in FY19. As UWMC has returned to doing these offerings, we can expect purchase volume to increase, and offset refinance volume (which is still going very strong, even if it is lower YoY).
4. As mortgage rates increased, they remained far below the 2019 Interest Rate, and have recently ticked down. Furthermore, UWMC‚Äôs rates compared to retail are 15 basis points better (.15%), which equates to roughly $28 in savings per month for consumers. Furthermore, selling a home takes a median of 25 days (the fastest rate ever), and down from 40 days the year before). Moreover, 46% of properties went under contract within a single week and 59% did so within two weeks. However, the time to close is extremely high for Mortgage companies and the average is 58 days on average. However, UWMC‚Äôs is 18 days, and it was 16 in December (whereas competitors time to close increased. The Broker Channel is faster, and cheaper, for consumers and that should scale well as the wholesale market continues to take market share generally.
5. Their issuance of a 700-Million-dollar senior note with a 5.5% interest rate to pay off an MSR facility, and for general corporate purposes is a bullish sign as it indicates to me they are experiencing heavy volume and want to grab as much market share as possible.

Going Forward:

1. The sale of lots, and the issuance of permits is red hot, and you can start seeing a lot more inventory coming online later in 2021 and throughout 2022. Furthermore, demand going forward should still be strong for a few years at minimum (if, probably, lower than 2020-2021).
2. ‚ÄúThe population of 25- to 34-year-olds is 9% larger than the 35- to 44-year-old group, signaling to homebuilders that a wave of demand is on the horizon. The bank's modeling suggests monthly housing starts will land between 1.7 million and 2 million through 2024, markedly higher than the February reading of 1.4 million.‚Äù ‚Äì Straight from the Jeffrey‚Äôs Analyst here ([4 Reasons Jefferies Sees Long and Sustainable Boom in US Housing (businessinsider.com)](https://www.businessinsider.com/housing-market-sustainable-boom-homebuyers-mortgage-rates-millennials-construction-jefferies-2021-4) √† I‚Äôm not going to mention the other points brought here.
3. Mortgage Servicing Rights, which UWMC has been acquiring more and more of will act as a hedge against higher inflation rates, and will also serve as a source of steady cash flow through good times and time when the housing market is slower. Considering the delinquency rate for applicants for UWMC is far lower than the average, due to their high FICO scores, this means that UWMC is well positioned.

However, this is not what I wanted to discuss. I wanted to discuss the share price, and the fact that the chances of UWMC issuing a stock buyback, issuing a special dividend, and/or increasing the dividend are extremely likely. Not least of all, because he said that they were looking to do so if there was excess cash, and it looks very likely that there will be. You can find their CEO talking about it on the Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript (Page 6 if I recall), or you can just listen to it all.

**The Stock Buyback**

Please remember the stock buyback authorization lets the company take advantage and buy at any time within a period. I also know that the price will go up on the declaration of earnings and a buyback, but I want to show some wicked math.

Before we look at a buyback, we should look at how much the annual dividend of .40 (A dividend Yield of 5.32%!), costs the company and if it is able to service its dividend and debts well. The annual dividend comes at around 640 Million, while the 1.5B of Senior Notes comes in at 82.5 Million in interest per year. The sum, therefore, is $722,500,000 that UWMC needs to pay out to shareholders, and to bondholders. Considering the first quarter alone will not only pay all that but leave around $300 Million, or more, in profit we can safely say that the dividend payout ratio is safe and that UWMC can easily service its debts.

However, perhaps you can see something here that I see? That is right. The dividend yield is almost as high as the interest rate on these senior notes. Stock buybacks are usually issued to increase prices, but also to improve earnings per share because the share count is decreased. **However,** I much prefer when they are issued on high yield dividend stocks and I will explain why here. This is because while it simultaneously increases earnings per share, it also substantially improves cash flow and profit and helps lower the share payout ratio. It does not matter if they are public float shares, or control shares, when it has a dividend. Either way your profit

Let us do some paper math. UWMC has 1.6 Billion in shares (all inclusive), and a market cap of 12.05 Billion. They have 1.5 Billion in Senior Notes with an interest rate of 5.5%. Let us just go ahead and say that they wanted to do a share buyback of 1.5 Billion (I think this is too high, but I am conveying a point here). That would be 12.4% of all Shares in UWMC. If all these shares were purchased at exactly $7.50, that would equate to exactly 200 Million Shares. 200 Million Shares times the dividend yield (40 Cents!), is equivalent to 80 Million Dollars.

Therefore, between now and 2025, the interest payments on the 1.5 Billion Dollar in Senior Notes will be essentially paid off by the stock buyback. Furthermore, after 2025 there will only be the 700 Million Senior Note left, which means that there will only be interest payments of 38.5 Million per year until 2029 when the Senior Note is Due. That means that between 2025 and 2029, 166 Million will have been saved up and can be utilized to help pay 2029‚Äôs Senior Note‚Äôs Principal. From 2021 to 2029 UWMC will have saved up 640 Million that it otherwise would have had to pay over that 8-year period. Over a 10 YR period it will save 800 Million.

As the share price climbs lower (Yes, intended to say climb lower ha-ha because I like buying this cheap), it becomes more and more likely that UWMC is compelled to issue a share buyback as the dividend yield would surpass the senior notes interest & could lead to very significant savings.

However‚Ä¶.

**The Stock Buy Back + Dividend Raise Trick**

If UWMC felt extremely bullish, and simultaneously wanted to indicate the markets needed to take it a lot more seriously it could do this sleight of hand. As it decreased the share count, and thus the annual yield by 12.5%, it could raise the dividend by 12.5% to 45 Cents. This would increase your annual dividend yield from 5.32% to 6% while simultaneously increasing EPS.

**Plus, a Special Dividend?**

I personally would rather they reinvest the money in the company than do a special dividend, but they have a fortress of a balance sheet with a good cash balance and equity, and strong free cash flow so‚Ä¶. They could declare a special dividend of .41-.42 cents, which is equivalent to Rocket‚Äôs 5.5% Special Dividend. Considering they made around $3.38 in net income last year, they could issue a stock buyback of 1.5Billion, pay the raised 640 Million annual dividend of .45, and do a special dividend costing another 640 Million. That would total 2.78B, leaving them with some profit for the year to put this in perspective. Considering taxes, they probably would be in the red by around 285 Million. Considering their strong cash reserves, they could do it however, but it is not something I‚Äôd do (at least with such a high special dividend). HOWEVER, I‚Äôd prefer they reinvest the money into new technology and growing market share than a special dividend as they own 35% of the wholesale broker channel‚Äôs market share and want to expand that to 50%.

**This Stock Will Pay You to Hold It on Margin**

Depending on your Brokerage, this stock will pay you to hold it. Robinhood Gold gives you the first 1,000 margin free, and thereafter 2.5% annual. IBKR starts at 1.59% and goes down from there.

Let us say you are placing $1000 on margin, and the annual interest rate is 2.5%. That means you pay 25 dollars in yearly interest. That is .068 cents a day. At 7.50, you can purchase 133.333 UWMC shares. That equates to $53.33 per year. A $28.33 profit.

Now, to have a paper loss the share price would need to decrease by 21 cents to $7.29. However, remember that the yield is making you money regardless, and if you believe it will go up long term you do not care. Where this matters however is collateral, or how much you need in your brokerage. I am extremely well capitalized on my utilization of margin so that the company would have to go bankrupt (go to 0) or near enough to it, before I would have to shift money around to make sure I am not margin called. Everyone has their risk tolerance. If you decide to make a play like this, you should know yours and work towards a allocation that is comfortable for you.

**The Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt**

There has been a lot of bemoaning regarding UWMC, and I can say it has felt a little bit like being DeepFuckingValue here before GME mooned. It has gotten to the point where someone gloatingly asked if I had sold yet like 1-2 weeks after I had posted a DD, and I told them I had bought more instead after it went down further.

I do not care about a daily return, or weekly returns. That is not to mean I do not do them on occasion, but there is such a thing as MoM returns. Especially if it is compounding. Say you have $50,000 last month invested in one stock. Next month, you sell for a 67 percent profit and now have $83,500. That is a month-on-month profit of 33.5%. You repeat that exact same scenario with $83,500, and that turns into $139,445. So over four months, through compounding, your total return is 278.98% for a 4-month period on your initial $50,000.

The only catalysts I care about are on May 5th, and May 7th. May 5th for Earnings, and May 7 because it is the Russel inclusion list for June Reconstitution. While I don‚Äôt really care about the Russel bump, for some reason some people seem to, and I can appreciate the fact that liquidity would increase as volume has been thin recently.

Let me be clear, I do not care if it goes down between now and then, and in point of fact, I **want** it to because I can keep averaging down and increase my MoM average. I bought more today. And if it goes down again, I‚Äôll keep buying.

The only thing I care about is Forward EPS, and Dividend Payout Ratio. The Analysts think that the EPS FY 2021 will be 1.42. I know that is wrong, and outdated, because they expect only .4 in Q1 2021, and that goes against UWMC guidance completely. Let us say, conservatively, that they make 1 Billion in Net Income after taxes‚Ä¶ 1B Net Income/1.6 Billion Shares=.625 EPS for Q1 2021. 800 Million in Net Income/1.6 Billion Shares=.5 EPS for Q1 2021. Regardless, I will just go ahead and state that .4 is fine. That quarter alone will pay off the dividend for the full year under the dividend payout ratio. The FY 1.42 Analyst Expectations (Which is wrong and potentially outdated?), means that the dividend payout ratio is 27.2% which is a very, very, good ratio. The Nasdaq Website shows the Forward P/E at 5.47 on the future EPS of 1.4. However, I believe that EPS for FY 2021 will be roughly around 2-2.22, which gives a forward P/E ratio of 3.75 to 3.378.

At the end of the day, because of this, I have peace of mind to say I want to buy more if it goes to 7, 6, or 5 before earnings. My thought process is ‚ÄúOh, a dividend yield of 5.7/6.67/8 percent, with a payout ratio of 27.2% at absolutely MINIMUM, and a payout ratio of 20% or less of -my- calculations? SWEET! Oh, and this share price means they HAVE to do a stock buyback because they save so much fucking money. Fucking WOOHOO!‚Äù Furthermore, the company in its first quarter alone is going to earn 1/12th of its market cap in profit roughly, and it is based on its own guidance. So, yes, I want the price to go down. Because I know it‚Äôll go up to its fair value, and my MoM will increase the further down I average.

Wall Street Bets likes to think the market is a casino like experience. We have our weekly slots players buying weekly calls/puts, and our momentum/swing traders doing the equivalent of playing roulette. But then there are the people like me, deep value investors, who heads straight to the blackjack table, and then counts. And the best part of it is, it is legal. I look at this stock, and I see one of the easiest deep value buys I will ever make. I don‚Äôt care about the journey, since I know where the destination is. I **like the stock**.

But do not look at me, look at today at around 5. That is when a dark money buyer bought a huge tranche of shares and the share price went from -.20 to +.41. I checked the order book, and the sell orders from 7.61 to 7.92 were all there, which meant they had not bought from the public. Some guy bought a fuck ton of shares.

My Position: 4,358 Shares averaged at around $8.06, $6 Calls May/21, $7.5 May 21.

**This is not financial advice, I just love the stock.**

**TLDR:** Wall Street Bets likes to think the market is a casino like experience.

&#x200B;

IMPORTANT EDIT: A commenter somewhere else told me that the dividend is only for shareholders of Class A shares and not Class D (SFS Corp which the owners own). I mistakenly assumed that it was for holders of all common stock. Therefore, the actual dividend is only 41.3 Million which means stockholder's equity grows much more vastly than otherwise indicated. With that said if you go to the 10-K on page 49 you can see that every single share of Class D stock can be exchanged for Class A stock. Also the stock based compensation of people can be seen in the SEC filing on the UWMC investor relations site. This means a stock buyback can still be done, but it might not be the slam dunk proposition i had thought and that a much higher dividend than I had thought, or a huge special dividend might be something that is more likely to happen as opposed to a buyback."
2021-04-13 03:03:49,wallstreetbets,"I'm gonna be honest. I read the first paragraph, saw how long the post was and said nah fuck that. I'm glad DD is being put out on the company though.


I'd like to contribute by voicing my experience having UWMC underwrite my loan. I live in an area where selling your house at the listed price means you fucked up. Since buying my house in july its 'value' (according to redfin, take it with a grain of salt) has gone up 30K in value. To say it's a sellers market is an understatement.


All that being said, I contacted 5 companies about securing my home loan. Of the 5, UWMC was the fastest in replying, had the most competitive rates, and had the best customer service I experienced. 


What do I mean by faster replying? I heard back from Todd later that same day about my loan. Once my side of paperwork was submitted, it took... 2 days? Max? To get a pre-qualification that allowed me to make an offer. To put in perspective, I didnt hear back from the slowest until i closed (offer submitted Friday, reviewed monday, called tuesday saying it was mine if I wanted it).


What do I mean by beat rates? Better than the worst by over a whole percent.


What do I mean by best customer service? I emailed todd late saturday about some random question I had, fully expecting a response no earlier than Monday. This motherfucker hits me up with a response at 11pm that night.


Having said all this, I currently own no UWMC and do not plan on buying any just yet. Im full ape and 100% in GME. That being said, UWMC Is REAL fucking high on my GME tendie reinvestment plan.

And they can‚Äôt make it up in volume, we just went through the biggest refi boom in history. Brokers are very well positioned to capture refinance business. Not so much on the purchase side. Most builders won‚Äôt work with them and due to the low supply of existing homes the construction to permanent business is shot up (buying a lot and building a house). Guess who rarely has the ability to offer construction to perm loans... Brokers, and UWM doesn‚Äôt at all.

But we aren't talking about Nintendo or viac. This is a mortgage company making loans at a time when millions of people are out of work and the only thing keeping them in their homes is a moratorium on foreclosures.

Maybe the government is steady behind the wheel. Maybe they learned a lesson last time. 

But my cynical nature says they still don't give a fuck and will buy puts on mortgage companies while the rest of us go down with the ship.

There is a reason they are shorting this stock. They remember 2008 like the rest of us.

Anyway, thanks for the DD. I'm not going to put more money in right now. Everything is red and I'm broke until something goes gree or Friday and either way GME is first in line.

I hope your right about everything. You sound real smart. Some psychopaths are smart too."

I wouldn't buy this at 10 or 11, even though there is strong upside. I would buy this in the 7's or 8's as I've preached time and time again. Especially because the lower it goes, the more likely the company does something around earnings.

With that said, to each their own, and I'm glad you've recovered your losses. No one should wish another man to lose his tendies. I wish you good luck m9."

To me it looks like a value trap, burning cash, high debt, best year is behind it, BBB- rating on the junk bonds, 

Just read the 10k and decide for yourself... I just see borrowing money to pay a dividend as more value destruction..."

2021-04-12 22:29:35,wallstreetbets,"I think you should read the earnings call transcript for Q4 2020 where their speaking to Analysts (You can also listen to the call on the investor relations part of the website)  [UWM Holdings Corporation (UWMC) CEO Mat Ishbia on Q4 2020 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4403964-uwm-holdings-corporation-uwmc-ceo-mat-ishbia-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) . I think you'll find it very illuminating. 

As for the value trap, analysts  say the average is 11.20 on Marketwatch.  [UWMC | UWM Holdings Corp. Analyst Estimates | MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/uwmc/analystestimates) . With that said analyst estimates for UWMC in the first quarter look fucking bad, and are plain out wrong, so Marketwatch miiight not be the best source for me to use. I'd refer you to the Q4 2020 Earnings beat however. They did .62 EPS while analysts expected .30. 

 If you look here. They give guidance for closed loan volume roughly equivalent, or slightly higher than Q4 2020. With that said, as stated, gain margin is a bit lower so net income might be lower by a little bit.

2021-04-13 01:28:02,wallstreetbets,If the opportunity cost is too high for you at the moment then I imagine it would be better to take the loss and be able to use that liquidity instead of holding until the price has recovered to a point where you've hit your original investment point or higher.

2021-04-12 20:42:18,wallstreetbets,"Memes aside, this is an extremely oversold stock, and it's been beaten down roughly. However, it's a money maker. What one would call a rain maker. And it's paying me to hold it while I wait. So I am okay with what's going on. 

As long as my month on month return is where I want it to be, or over it, then I'll consider the trade a success. And ultimately, the more it goes down, the more likely there is a massive stock buy back."
2021-04-13 02:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Not only that, but more upside room to run.  This stock is so undervalued, it's more undervalued than GME was when it was in single digits.  UWMC is a fintech company and is growing market share in an industry with HUGE demand.  It made $1.37 Billion NET income last quarter and I wouldn't be surprised if this quarter is even higher.  They will be bigger than most banks soon.  These recent popularity challenges that have put the price so attractively low won't matter once earnings blow our minds next quarter."

2021-04-12 21:03:45,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Although this is a rather risky and large example (since I don‚Äôt have that much long in GME), this is pretty much always how I hedge against losses on bullish positions I‚Äôm holding long term.

If the put immediately goes against me I will cut it right away."

2021-04-13 11:28:05,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I have never exercised an option. I rarely ever hold them to expiration except for a few that have gone out worthless on me. You generally don‚Äôt want to exercise an option because when you do that, yes you get to buy the 100 shares at the lower cost, but you lose all of the EXTRINSIC Val of the option if you exercise it. Also, in many cases I don‚Äôt actually have enough cash on hand to make the 100 share purchase were into exercise my option. I recommend educating yourself about options they are easy to learn. You will find that most options traders hardly ever, if ever at all, exercise their option contracts."

2021-04-12 23:04:02,wallstreetbets,"Just get an online education on buying puts it‚Äôs all out there. OTM is substantially more risky, but with more upside as well. Its all about how much risk you feel comfortable with. This is a well known hedging strategy. My advice would be to start on YouTube maybe or here on Reddit and learn everything you can learn about options trading, both calls and puts."

To kick off earnings season, we‚Äôve got seven of the largest American banks reporting their financials this week, and I want my slice of the pie. This week provides us with an awesome opportunity to make some money, as stocks within the financial sector tend to move extremely predictably post-earnings, allowing us to make some easy dough.

#Implied Volatility during Earnings Season

Because it is earnings week, the IV on our options will be jacked to the tits as the option needs to price in any given ‚Äúmove‚Äù that the underlying may make. In practice, this is *extremely* hard to do right, and often results in an *extremely* inflated guess, as it‚Äôs calculated in relation to a whole fuckload of ever changing variables. The implied move that an option prices in around earnings is very rarely met, so if you buy options, understand that they will expire OTM 95% of the time. The other 5% of the time, you‚Äôll get IV crushed so badly that you might not even walk away with any profits, even though you called the correct move.

&nbsp;

Armed with this knowledge, we know that if we wish to ‚Äúgamble‚Äù on earnings, we‚Äôre best off selling the options. We may not hit any insane 10 baggers, but we‚Äôre extremely likely to pocket some free money, even if the underlying doesn‚Äôt move as planned.

# The Play

If it wasn‚Äôt made obvious from the rundown above, we‚Äôre going to be selling options going into the financial sectors‚Äô earnings season. The easiest and most consistent way to win during earnings season is to sell short strangles, and iron condors. With these strategies, we don‚Äôt need to be right about the directional movement of the underlying whatsoever. We simply collect a fat upfront premium, and then buy back the spread the day after earnings have been reported at an insane discount (often 60-80% cheaper) because of IV crush.

&nbsp;

Even though the options always price in a crazy move, historically, the stocks within the financial sector tend to *move very little* after they report earnings. This makes this play extremely safe in my eyes, as there is very little risk we get blown out by an unexpected move. Furthermore, the companies in this sector are very old, consistent, and established. It‚Äôs extremely unlikely that they would release something totally unexpected within their reports which would warrant a wild move, though the options still price it in anyways.

&nbsp;

To aid us in our play, [**I‚Äôve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of the Post-Earnings Moves that every single reporting bank has made for the past 20 earnings cycles**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16b_OLj9fDEyKlanro3qSeeSeNaD9XxMeyPv4NkclMN4/edit?usp=sharing). Using the spreadsheet, we can determine which options to sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for every single bank. For example, we can see that historically, on average, $JPM moves less than 2% following an earnings report, and that the largest move that $JPM has ever made post earnings was 5% to the upside. As a result, we know what if we sell a call credit spread that‚Äôs 5% out of the money, we can be almost certain that it will expire out of the money by the end of the week, allowing us to pocket most, if not all of the premium. For those traders who can stomach more risk, we can look to sell short straddles on $JPM that are 2% out of the money on both ends to pocket an even larger premium, while still having a favourable risk profile.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;


- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it‚Äôs likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as *these banks report across different days*. Since 4 of the 7 banks report on Wednesday, we can use their results to ‚Äúpredict‚Äù the direction of their peers who haven‚Äôt reported yet. If the four banks are green after reporting earnings on Wednesday, the ones who report Thursday and Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.


- As touched upon above, **$JPM moves very little after earnings**. You can likely get away with placing extremely tight strangles as a result, since you run little risk of getting blown out on either side.

- **$WFC is allergic to delivering a good earnings report**. After its past 22 reports, Wells Fargo has tanked **18** times (82%). If you‚Äôre going to play this ticker, you can easily get away with selling credit spreads ATM or slightly OTM, as this shit is incapable of going up.

- Similar to Wells Fargo, **Citigroup either makes a small move to the upside, or gets blown out to the downside**. Slightly OTM credit spreads are the way to go if you‚Äôre playing this one.

- **If you‚Äôre playing Blackrock, make sure your strikes are far OTM**. It‚Äôs not uncommon for them to put up a 4% move post earnings. The moves are big, but the premiums are juicy. IF you plan on playing, I would look to play an iron condor, so I can have the protection if needed.

- In general, if you‚Äôre playing any sort of a strangle, you can safely sell any of the strikes which are outside of the highlighted maximum moves within the spreadsheet.

&nbsp;

If you use the spreadsheet to choose the safest strikes, these plays are incredibly hard to fuck up. You simply sell a short strangle / iron condor / credit spread, wait for earnings to be released, and then buy it back for significantly cheaper than what you sold it for.

&nbsp;

#The Gamblers Crutch

Selling options is boring, because you know exactly how much money you‚Äôre gonna make beforehand. If you wish to spice this play up with a little bit of *uncertainty*, consider picking up some **$XLF** Calls or Puts. XLF is made up of every single bank which is reporting earnings this week, yet since it‚Äôs an ETF, it has an extremely low IV, regardless of the fact that it‚Äôs gonna make some fucking *HUGE* moves since **all of it‚Äôs holding report earnings this week**. The implied volatility of each bank who reports earnings this week is around 50 or 60, yet XLF, who is made up of each reporting bank, has an IV of around 20%. 

&nbsp;

According to historical data, around earnings season, most banks move in tandem with one another ; they‚Äôre often all red, or all green. We can use this to our advantage, since half of the banks report earnings on Wednesday. Once a trend is established, we can grab some 2DTE XLF calls and bag some free gains once the rest of the banks report earnings the day after. You can also just be a degenerate and try calling a direction before the banks report all together, though this would literally be a crapshoot. Regardless, the rewards you can make by playing XLF this week are spectacular, and those who don‚Äôt want to sell the options should definitely capitalize on this opportunity.

&nbsp;

#Summary and Conclusion

Seven of America's largest banks report earnings this week. I‚Äôve compiled a spreadsheet documenting their historical moves post earnings, alongside some interesting observations about them. It should be impossible to lose any of the trades you make on them, unless JPM announces that they‚Äôve invented a time machine or someshit. For those who want to slam a 10 bagger instead of securing guaranteed premium gains, consider buying calls / puts on $XLF. All of it‚Äôs holding report earnings this week, yet it still only has an IV of 20%. Since banks tend to move in tandem with one another, it‚Äôs either gonna pop or plunge. If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you‚Äôd like to share with the community, feel free to join my Discord, link can be found on my profile or in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**"
2021-04-12 20:22:53,wallstreetbets,XLF sounds like a good play. Banks are flushed with cash. This should be a blowout earnings report.

2021-04-12 21:14:51,wallstreetbets,"As far as I can tell, IV on all of these banks is already extremely low. Most of them show an IV rank in the single digits. Wouldn‚Äôt that make credit plays less desirable here?"

2021-04-13 02:09:17,wallstreetbets,"The last 20 earnings reports cover 5 years... Just be ready for losses on commercial loans, especially for commercial real estate. For example, on 3/30/2021 it was reported that American Dream (the new Mall in NJ) defaulted on a $1.2B construction loan with JP Morgan being one of the lenders. Going to be hard to predict what they reveal about such losses. In any case you might see some drops in financial stocks."
2021-04-13 11:56:10,wallstreetbets,"Nice write up! I have a lot of exposure to banks, so the low IV $XLF is a nice gamble to amplify gains or hedge. Personally I think the low IV XLF buy play is more interesting than the IV crush play - the historical context is interesting but this is certainly not a ""business as usual year."" Lots of factors at play - hedge funds blowing up, real estate market potentially in a bubble, massive inflation. Personally I would model a move based on the outliers in your spreadsheet rather than the majority. 

Picked up these for about 10k. Volume was pretty low so half my order on the 34P pushed it a penny.

2021-04-13 13:21:49,wallstreetbets,"How does this have downvotes? Even IF GameStop becomes as good as Microcenter and offers people to come in and pay $ to play in tournaments and be able to buy PC parts, is likely still won't be financially successful.

People are still going to buy PC parts at home from online retailers where they don't have to go somewhere in person, check if one store has it in stock, and pay full price when they coulda just checked online against 10 online vendors offering the same thing, better in stock numbers, and with frequent sales they can have reminders and popups for.

Not many people at all want a PC BANG set up either in the US, as we all have good home PCs and pretty good internet. Why pay an hourly fee to be outside your home playing an online game? Only tournaments drive people and there aren't that many of those happening even precovid for many genres.

Like, in what crazy world view do people think GameStop is going to be popular in 2025 and beyond? Everything and I mean EVERYTHING would have to go ridiculously well for them. Perfect distribution, new store layouts, new offers and incentives, all new staff that aren't shitty, good preowned sale rates, etc, etc. The infrastructure alone for PC part delivery, staying in stock and up to date, rewiring it to have fiber for online tournaments, and more would cost millions of dollars before being profitable and we would see restructuring years away... There aren't even any real pilot stores or anything. It's gunna stay a boring brick and mortar and die that way too. Sorry to crush your childhood dreams, but consoles and PCs might not even offer physical games AT ALL on their next generations. It's way better to just let people digitally buy stuff and not need all of the physical production, waste, 18 wheelers, and retail salaries."

It's a game of attrition.  If you sell, they win.  Just don't use money that you need, like for rent, car payment, gas or enemas.

2021-04-12 22:06:19,wallstreetbets,I am also curious.  Serious question.  I feel like i made a bad decision buying at 186.  I had the opportunity to buy at ~41 out of pure coincidence.  Didn‚Äôt realize that was rock bottom then and decided to some more homework before buying.  Went back later to buy assuming it would be at like 48 tops...   was at 190 something.
2021-04-12 21:29:32,wallstreetbets,Why are u proud of losing money?
2021-04-12 20:47:30,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs right why look at a loss when you shall see the gains...

2021-04-13 05:43:51,wallstreetbets,Someone has to. Why buy now if you don‚Äôt believe there will be buyers when it goes up past $200? The risk reward just doesn‚Äôt make sense. In fact I think you‚Äôve just persuaded me to sell now
2021-04-13 11:26:58,wallstreetbets,Didn't use his time machine to see what the price would of been.  I did the same.
2021-04-12 22:17:24,wallstreetbets,"Your risk tolerance is just different. Trust me I'd be so happy to be at $186 a share right now. I avg down to $241. Hoping it'll drop more! There is too many good news ahead for GME for it to go belly up right now.

If anything having the price go down will encourage the HF to massively double down and we will drive it right back up.

Just remember not to gamble with what you can't afford to lose."

I am numb to sideways movement, I am numb to incremental gains, I feel a rush of blood to my pp when I see a negative sign and a double digit number following it for I know that that is the time to get more of my precious"
2021-04-12 22:12:29,wallstreetbets,"I dont know what the price will go to, but I think naysayers like yourself fail to understand the DD that's behind the short to begin with, and fail to fundamentally understand what an **infinite** squeeze means due to the inatr **infinite risks**.
The gist since day fucking one has been that hedge funds bet on not just lowering the price of gme (it was LESS THAN $5 A SHARE WHEN THEY STARTED SHORTING. HOLY SHIT, WHAT IS SO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND?) - That means they thought the price would be LESS THAN $5 BY 2021.

>it is currently hovering at 139 after 4 months.

That is...a doom scenario for a short position, especially one done at a conservative estimate tens of millions to possible hundreds of millions of synthetic shorting.


The thesis behind the ""meme price"" only requires that **one** of multiple DDs on this subject be correct

1)Those that claimed to have *completely* covered their shorts in January either lied OR did not cover a substantial amount 

2)there are other parties heavily shorting gme that did not cover beyond the ""big players""

3)the ""big shorters"" used the infinite money glitch last year to *substantially* short multiple companies outside GME

4)Shorters continue to artificially hinder GMES true share price by abusing dark pools and/or deep ITM calls to mask their FTDS



#any of these scenarios with GMEs surge since January would trigger a MOASS and result in an ASTRONOMICAL number

Could it stop at 3k? 5k? Sure. Could it HYPOTHETICALLY hit a million per share in this event? *Absolutely*

The really only counter to the four options above is,

>GME is currently not being heavily shorted by any big hedge fund that intended to bankrupt it last year 


So if you don't have a counter DD beyond that, you're just opting to be a contrarion clown."
2021-04-12 23:20:29,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-12 21:55:39,wallstreetbets,Lol I joke my cost basis is $17. But yes if you know why you got in and nothing has happened to change your initial motivation then why leave? Loss is only realized when sold.
2021-04-13 01:36:46,wallstreetbets,No he‚Äôs retarded
2021-04-12 22:27:15,wallstreetbets,Td has short interest at around 18%. Do you think they are lying or just wrong? When this started it was well over 100% which justified the squeeze we saw. What more are you expecting?

2021-04-13 14:02:11,wallstreetbets,"Edit:  ""Someone wanted it enough to buy it at over $350""

&#x200B;

So....."
2021-04-13 14:46:50,wallstreetbets,Grappling into straws I see. Lol
2021-04-13 16:38:34,wallstreetbets,Arrrggghhhh... I need to panic buy!
2021-04-13 17:22:12,wallstreetbets,"Ok cool, but when are we going back to $40 so I can buy way more than at 140?  Dance for us GME."
2021-04-13 18:11:48,wallstreetbets,118 tomorrow me gets more
2021-04-13 18:49:23,wallstreetbets,I just changed my charting to candlesticks because I like red.
2021-04-13 19:17:54,wallstreetbets,I hope to the stock goes down more so I can buy shit load of it. It's gonna moon baby.
2021-04-13 10:00:36,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully it will rise again, but it's been a fun journey with this stock."
2021-04-13 02:53:41,wallstreetbets,GameStop color is red. I think
2021-04-13 01:19:35,wallstreetbets,"Well yeah, I‚Äôve got to delta hedge my puts."
2021-04-13 08:41:16,wallstreetbets,I bought more at $140 last time. Brought my average up from $37 but still worth it! Gotta average up lol
2021-04-13 06:22:39,wallstreetbets,Yep.
2021-04-12 20:40:50,wallstreetbets,0-60 (million) in 1.9 seconds
2021-04-12 21:39:18,wallstreetbets,this is the TA I came for
2021-04-13 03:15:40,wallstreetbets,So we‚Äôre predicting some resistance at 420?
2021-04-13 11:24:07,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs simple math, Guardian."
2021-04-13 03:20:20,wallstreetbets,Inverted Tesla.....a bullish trend perhaps
2021-04-13 17:34:42,wallstreetbets,That's how the market works now lol
2021-04-12 22:09:58,wallstreetbets,Than you can start writing covered calls and start actually making some money off of GME for once.
2021-04-12 20:05:57,wallstreetbets,I bought my 100th share at 4:20 today on cash app very happy!
2021-04-13 08:45:11,wallstreetbets,"Like pokemon, gotta collect each share at every dollar."
2021-04-13 16:58:18,wallstreetbets,"I made it to 100 eventually, which makes me comfortable because when it spikes to 10k I can get out and retire. Now every payday that it hasn't spiked I'm picking up another share or two for the continued meme. Who needs a liquid emergency fund?"
2021-04-12 20:11:39,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-13 05:45:28,wallstreetbets,You gonna but it all the way down to 5$?
2021-04-12 20:41:11,wallstreetbets,Smooth brain slam poetry... Edgy stuff
2021-04-12 23:02:33,wallstreetbets,Or you bought GME in early March or late January
2021-04-13 05:42:14,wallstreetbets,If Melvin has covered that means he is on -49% right
2021-04-13 07:06:22,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs looking like it wants to test the 100 day moving average which is about $89, can‚Äôt see it going much lower than that though."
2021-04-12 21:56:34,wallstreetbets,Thought I was the only one. Today was a good day :)
2021-04-12 23:23:06,wallstreetbets,Red is the best crayon color
2021-04-13 01:32:06,wallstreetbets,"But High, Sell Low is my motto"
2021-04-13 15:12:08,wallstreetbets,Da red ones go faster?
2021-04-13 03:06:20,wallstreetbets,Samesies
2021-04-13 12:49:47,wallstreetbets,I'm stuck around there myself. Wish I had waited even longer.
2021-04-12 22:22:57,wallstreetbets,I have a feeling you typed this while fucking!
2021-04-13 00:53:01,wallstreetbets,Seriously. I‚Äôll check now like once a day to see if we are on the moon. If not check again tomorrow üôåüíé
2021-04-13 00:20:56,wallstreetbets,Can you ask my wife to call me?
2021-04-13 01:30:50,wallstreetbets,*this is the way*
2021-04-12 23:43:21,wallstreetbets,Dad? Is that you?
2021-04-13 01:01:48,wallstreetbets,Buying 10 more shares tomorrow.
2021-04-12 23:46:47,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm also a dummy who bought more shares today. Let‚Äôs gooo!
2021-04-13 03:46:09,wallstreetbets,"I will just keep buying the more it goes down and quite frankly the longer it all takes the more I will have time to put in. The dream for me is a year or two of 20/share because when it moons I'll just have had more time and money to buy cheap.



Red or green doesn't matter to me atm because I know it will all be golden brown and crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside in the end."
2021-04-13 05:56:47,wallstreetbets,"Another 16 on discount? Why yes, I do not mind at all my good sir. Hedgies are fuküíéüëêüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"
2021-04-12 20:07:39,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
2021-04-12 20:35:55,wallstreetbets,Dont forget to get your dog a credit card and then taking out the entire cash advance.
2021-04-12 20:13:55,wallstreetbets,If it goes to the 50s I will sell my shitty car and go all in
2021-04-12 20:12:56,wallstreetbets,"Lol
@ $50 im gonna be so broke....
But hey, i love a great sale"
2021-04-12 21:51:34,wallstreetbets,"This completely. I have so many lines of credit untouched, if it goes to 50 or below we will be the hedgies even worse nightmare."
2021-04-12 21:37:34,wallstreetbets,"This guy is the apest, take some free silver."
2021-04-12 22:44:49,wallstreetbets,If it goes to 50 or less I‚Äôm buying to avg down. I don‚Äôt think anyone has higher avg than me.
2021-04-12 20:17:04,wallstreetbets,I second this
2021-04-13 04:11:46,wallstreetbets,"If GME goes to $50, I'll paper hand all my other investments and go all in on GME"
2021-04-12 23:46:43,wallstreetbets,I already took out a bank loan and am waiting for 50...
2021-04-12 22:47:53,wallstreetbets,Right there with ya. I‚Äôve got a lot of dry powder if this shit dips
2021-04-13 01:29:38,wallstreetbets,"Sure why not commit fraud üòÇ you know that‚Äôs one of the agreements you sign when taking a loan right?

Delusional bulls stoooooping lmao"

2021-04-13 14:11:55,wallstreetbets,This comment at 420 upvotes... what does an ape do?
2021-04-12 23:14:21,wallstreetbets,"It's even better since Gamestop has said nothing regarding this since the January squeeze. Every article that comes out, says Gamestop didnt respond for comment. They don't need to. They know what they are doing to shift the business and it will be shown soon. 

I'm jacked to the tits!!"
2021-04-13 01:01:45,wallstreetbets,"reporter email: hey gamestop whats up? anything new? btw check out my mix article

GME : huh <deleted>

2021-04-13 06:00:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah my thoughts exactly. The whole article reads like desperation. 
Dunno, but I think this week is going to be crazy! üöÄüöÄüöÄ"
2021-04-13 00:23:47,wallstreetbets,Nice couch
2021-04-13 12:28:10,wallstreetbets,Sit your ass now and re-ass(es) later. Much re ass‚Äôing.
2021-04-12 23:05:20,wallstreetbets,Not true! When the shorts buy my shares for 5 figures or more they will do so without _wanting_ to
2021-04-12 23:13:25,wallstreetbets,"This is a total hit piece though, it's not just one part of the article I'm calling out.

I hear what you're saying, but it's important to recognize that, if the institutions were actually winning and gme lost its luster, it wouldn't have buyers over 100 bucks, period."
2021-04-12 23:24:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah such dishonest weasel words. It's also up, checks chart, 2,876.58% ""in a year."""
2021-04-13 06:57:42,wallstreetbets,I know math is difficult for you newcomers to wsb but you can in fact calculate losing streaks for longer than 4 months.
2021-04-13 01:03:28,wallstreetbets,"https://www.ascendiant.com/Services/Market-Making-Trading

It makes you wonder if his company is short GME also."
2021-04-13 00:54:05,wallstreetbets,POS in deed
2021-04-12 23:07:30,wallstreetbets,Yep! And I'll be buying a bunch at that price (5 is a lot for me haha)
2021-04-13 06:56:59,wallstreetbets,The only thing desperate is your account.
2021-04-12 23:32:39,wallstreetbets,"Thanks fucking God, someone who is reasonable.

Can't wait till the circle jerk is over and we can get back to normal shitposting"
2021-04-12 23:00:50,wallstreetbets,"Price finding it's natural state, which is above $0. Why do people care what other people are willing to pay for gme stock? 

Does any one care what people are buying best buy at? Amazon? (Insert random biotech firms here)?

RC succeeded at chewy. Im betting on him doing it again. Is $130 to much for current valuations, sure. 

""Amazon would have to sell every book."" Or start selling other things.... or everything. 

Gaming is a real industry. Is RC guaranteed success, no. I bought stock in the belief he would."
2021-04-13 13:01:01,wallstreetbets,"Oh no, nothing organic about it, it has been discovered that they are making their purchases through dark pools while making their sales through open market. AKA they are only calculating price movement based on sold stock but not the purchased stock, massively surpressing the price."
2021-04-13 06:55:54,wallstreetbets,This is just sheer idiocy.
2021-04-13 16:07:44,wallstreetbets,This comment hurt my brain it is so fucking retarded.
2021-04-12 20:53:34,wallstreetbets,They're selling synthetics on the open exchanges and routing buy orders through the dark pools
2021-04-13 03:04:09,wallstreetbets,The average person over 40
2021-04-13 02:31:03,wallstreetbets,"News flair, not DD. And yes, it is true about every stock. That's what I'm saying, it didn't really drop like it should have because folks are still deeply into it, even when it looks grim. The article is a hit piece trying to say it's over."
2021-04-13 00:19:16,wallstreetbets,"We only have fake news, it's either Trump's propaganda machines or corporate fascists."
2021-04-13 07:44:59,wallstreetbets,Hopefully they all get wiped out in GME collapsing like a stone and fuck back off to wherever they came from
2021-04-12 23:15:07,wallstreetbets,Feel better? A nap helps.
2021-04-12 22:04:29,wallstreetbets,"This scenario assumes the only price retail bought at is 200 and that they sold at 125 instead of holding. If you buy high and sell low you lose. Truly a wrinkle brained hypothesis. 

HF A shorts at 200 and covers at 175 while HF B shorts at 175 and covers at 150, etc. Except that HF is paying interest to short. Retail has been buying the entire time (and according to Bloomberg has increased their position). If retail does not sell, then HF Y is going to get fucked as the price rebounds due to increased demand and they now have to pay everyone because their short didn't get covered by HF Z. If they short through the demand then they'll be paying interest out the ass and you can bet another HF will call their bluff (see late January). 

Nice FUD."
2021-04-13 01:30:57,wallstreetbets,"Yep, it's the natural paper hands dip."
2021-04-12 23:40:38,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but if you don't eat, you're gonna die anyway. Isn't that the entire story of retail vs. firms? We got nothing to lose."
2021-04-13 01:53:32,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea what it will do, but this is freaking fun to be a part of."
2021-04-13 03:03:02,wallstreetbets,"Man, can you imagine if everyone‚Äôs idea of fun was just shitting on people for no reason?"
2021-04-13 00:22:45,wallstreetbets,"If you're feeling that way, you should get out for sure. And use what you've got to get a milkshake, pizza, or something and have a little fun.

Nothing should have that power over how you feel financially.

I knew this was coming, but I also feel positive about pushing up again.

If not, I'll take what's left and get my own shake!"
2021-04-13 02:20:06,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd bet real money it‚Äôs never been higher...it‚Äôs just not being reported correctly.
2021-04-13 11:08:23,wallstreetbets,"Correct, and gme is still very interesting despite the crazy price."

2021-04-13 17:24:58,wallstreetbets,It will stop when we all vote to recall
2021-04-13 10:51:34,wallstreetbets,Improving your position from $37 to $139 ... This is the way.

2021-04-13 01:27:42,wallstreetbets,My average is 350. Guess I‚Äôm just retarded
2021-04-13 03:40:32,wallstreetbets,"Everytime I try to buy low, with GME, the low keeps getting lower!

How low can it go???"
2021-04-12 23:37:45,wallstreetbets,135ish here. I bought 2 because then it will keep going down after I buy. Then I can buy more at an even bigger discount
2021-04-13 01:13:23,wallstreetbets,Average 210 Im averaging down like a champion!
2021-04-13 00:17:55,wallstreetbets,This is the price that is holding up.
2021-04-13 07:23:05,wallstreetbets,Adding more here
2021-04-12 23:45:25,wallstreetbets,That's my plan!
2021-04-13 00:46:21,wallstreetbets,I did this at around $120 with a $160c and it jumped so fast I had to pay a fortune to buy the call back and not lose my shares.  Now I'm afraid to try it again.
2021-04-13 06:55:30,wallstreetbets,"I've been doing that, has been working great until last week :D  Good job I got some protective puts too @ 180 back when it mooned over 250."
2021-04-13 09:53:19,wallstreetbets,"But see then if the HFs buy the call, they can exercise them at whatever strike you got and still get a hella deal.  I've thought about this too but then got scared because they can still take your shares."
2021-04-12 21:36:56,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the XXX club fellow ape. Damn that 100th feels good. See very soon on the moon.

2021-04-13 09:53:38,wallstreetbets,Na cause they posted +20% for February
2021-04-12 22:39:48,wallstreetbets,Nope. I‚Äô like red too. My avg is so high like Red chart is my screen saver now.

2021-04-13 07:23:52,wallstreetbets,At these prices you‚Äôd be stupid NOT to buy!!!
2021-04-13 01:47:49,wallstreetbets,Exactly. There's no way out.
2021-04-13 01:24:38,wallstreetbets,You get a gold for the silver.
2021-04-12 21:47:05,wallstreetbets,"thank you sir, the loan is already approved and activated, used it to pay off my existing maxed out line of credit, so now the line of credit is ready to be put towards GME."
2021-04-13 03:14:16,wallstreetbets,Jesus it‚Äôs like you people WANT to die poor. Taking out loans just to double down on a meme stock that‚Äôs clearly on the tail end of being relevant is... not smart.

2021-04-13 07:36:18,wallstreetbets,"Am I wrong?
Have you seen the amount of FTDs for each day since back in early february? 
Now go add those up and compare it to the daily volume on GME for the same period of time. 

And if you're to lazy to do all that you can just look at the OBV indicator on GME/AMC and compare it to the OBV on other regular stocks."
2021-04-12 20:36:33,wallstreetbets,Short volume doesn‚Äôt equal short interest. Every short sale could be a market maker facilitating a buy order. (It‚Äôs probably 50/50)
2021-04-13 02:59:42,wallstreetbets,Do you have any source to back up that first statement (other than wishful thinking)?
2021-04-13 07:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Individual ownership dropped from 9.5% to 7.5%.  Retail has sold 21% of their positions.  So, some people actually are selling.  According to Bloomberg terminal screenshots posted here."
2021-04-13 03:17:04,wallstreetbets,"They don't know how to use reddit or buy meme stocks so I assume this doesn't affect anything.

2021-04-13 02:01:48,wallstreetbets,"Yo, you gotta be intellectually consistent. Trumps, Biden‚Äôs and corporate propaganda. You think there are good guys? Pfff...you‚Äôre only 2/3rds the way there."
2021-04-13 09:10:26,wallstreetbets,"If the world were just, it‚Äôd have already transpired!"
2021-04-12 23:22:45,wallstreetbets,"The market makers sole responsibility is to create liquidity in the market.  Literally every single trade on the market is between an individual or institution and the market maker.  Market makers hold massive bags in some situations while doing this but profit at the end of the day based on the sheer magnitude of trades they make.  Every exchange has specific market makers and the SEC rules that govern how they work - you can read all about it.

If you‚Äôre going to trade stocks take the time to actually learn about the systems in place and how the market fucking works for Christ sake.  And to make matters worse, instead of learning about the market you are throwing real money into you chose to literally push an ignorance based conclusion that ‚Äúsomeone likes the stock enough to be buying‚Äù.  I‚Äôm so tired of this sub being over ran with the unwashed ignorant masses of zoomers who know literally dick about the god damn markets.  Just shut the fuck up already.  Jesus."
2021-04-12 22:24:33,wallstreetbets,"Yep, no one on this sub has ever bought high and sold low lmao"
2021-04-12 23:57:23,wallstreetbets,"That's kind of the point: they do, so they stopped taking stupid bets. WSB caught them off guard and they lost. Big time. And it was hilarious.

But there's still something like 45% short on GME and the price continues to drop.

At some point you have to stop betting against the house."
2021-04-13 00:00:43,wallstreetbets,"There's a lot to lose here, and a lot to gain through many other opportunities in the rest of the market. The ""nothing to lose"" mentality is retarded. If you want to gamble and have nothing to lose, buy FDs instead"
2021-04-13 03:54:41,wallstreetbets,Yes I can imagine that.
2021-04-13 03:47:18,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. I‚Äôm here because paying money to kick some hedgies in their nuts is so much more fun than it has any right to be. 

So looking forward to the recall, want to see how many gluttonous sociopathic dollar worshippers we gonna be losing some precious monies."

It could be reported correctly and plainly, and you guys would invent a new reason why that it totally wasn't."

Any arguement for or against GME mooning is moot because retail is playing the game blind and has very little say in its price. The only thing you control is whether you buy in,  at what price if you do, and when you sell. I can think of a few scenarios where there's a possibility for HF's to screw a majority of retail, but in no scenario does everyone lose. Most of those scenarios have HF's bleeding money to screw retail over, which I doubt will be the case due to their greed as well."

2021-04-13 17:08:55,wallstreetbets,"Wolf exited the board recently because his Hestia investors want their GameStop position liquidated at a massive gain. He could not liquidate whilst being a board member. Hestia, during Wolf's tenure, held 3.290mm GME shares.
I believe this is behind the recent downward pressure on the stock, and the almost continuous blocks of 1000 shares coming down (you could see this on Lvl 2). They wouldn't have shunted the whole lot in one go as it would have crashed the price - they need to filter them through to maximise return.
All that said, I think the bottom is in and I am hoping for a surge back to ~200 levels in the coming weeks. But who knows with GME, it is impossible to call - by the fundamentals, it's worth maybe 40-70. By the hype and now-global brand recognition (as pointed out by Kevin O' Leary) it is worth maybe 250 to 300. But right now, all we can say for certain is it is worth about 140, because that's where the ticker sits."
2021-04-12 20:20:40,wallstreetbets,If they do a recall. No way gme does that.
2021-04-13 11:06:34,wallstreetbets,I don't agree with him that I'm wrong. I just said I'm already aware about how transactions work.

2021-04-13 09:13:07,wallstreetbets,"A reply and a downvote? Nice, now fuck off the sub and stop gatekeeping it."
2021-04-12 20:08:46,wallstreetbets,This made me chuckle
2021-04-13 02:49:08,wallstreetbets,"The hedge funds are simultaneously so powerful that they can manipulate the stock price downwards as much as they want in the face of all the diamond-handed apes, yet so powerless that they will be forced to buy at market price and drive the stock to the moon."

I was just coming of age then so I was clueless but I saw people lose a bunch of money to basically a Ponzi scheme! I‚Äôm not sure if HFs were involved back then, I was very, very green but I know illegal stuff happened like the illegal stuff now. Selling counterfeit stock!! I use options sometimes, good or bad I have the shares or money in my account. They all deserve real jail time, IMO."

2021-04-12 20:22:23,wallstreetbets,Are you saying gme won‚Äôt issue a notice to recall for votes? It‚Äôs already in writing I think vanguard said the notice goes out on the 15th and you have until the 20th to get your shares back from lending if u want to vote it‚Äôs not a conspiracy just a fact idek if it would trigger a squeeze except that it sorta did last year

If the share price is currently $140 then the $285 per share valuation (it is not valuation so really hate the way you used the term) is completely irrelevant. It would only be relevant if the stock price went over $285 per share. Even then that is not correct as it is proceeds of $1B, not $285 per share, so they can sell at a much higher price level, if the price actually went that high, just less shares then the full offering."

Yes it happened, but now its over. There are no catalysts left and holding like 7% of the total shares isn't gonna trigger anything because the trade restrictions on 26th January and subsequent dip allowed them to book their losses or hedge their shorts.

You can go ahead, take a look at OI chain and calculate amount of naked shorts in the market atm. You'd find it almost every short bet is hedged.

Apart from that, the daily volume is high enough to reduce DTC significantly low which wasn't the case back when the squeeze was on. It was over 6-7 days back then."

As to comparing to Tesla... There was no EV market a few years back. Tesla created the business. Digital game markets are all over the place. Maybe they can use some improvement, but vastly different creating a revolutionary EV business when there were no EV's (and everyone thought it was a joke, until it was not a joke and became an existential threat) versus trying to make a better online store. Seriously, comparing things to Tesla (or Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc) is a bit ridiculous."

2021-04-13 03:56:44,wallstreetbets,"You don't seem like you are asking for an honest opinion, but here goes.

My opinion is not to buy GME.

Do what you want. It is your money.

The only arguments I have seen for the price of GME has effectively been, buy shares to squeeze the hedgies. It is rare I see anyone try to argue that the pricing is based on some valuation of the company itself. With Tesla by comparison, I rarely have seen anyone suggest that the value is based on anything other then potential future profitability.

So make of that what you will. Combined with the company raising funds via issuing shares and I am sure they will issue more shares in the future (it gets expensive transforming these businesses and building an online business), I think it is near certain the stock will fall a lot more. It can definitely shoot up in the interim, like it did end of Feb.

Further, I would argue if the company cannot generate sufficient cash internally, they may find themselves with too low a share price to continue raising funds on the capital markets and that would pose an threat of going bankrupt. Basically, GME works as an investment if people buy into the story and keep the price inflated. Unless you have lots of confidence in the business, I would stay away."

2021-04-13 04:11:35,wallstreetbets,"Depending on how many shares they‚Äôre looking to issue I don‚Äôt think it is going to have that big of an effect on price first round. Of course that would be ruled out if I thought that people that bought in at 150-200-300 would sell for a loss at that point and we would see a stock worth $2 on the verge of bankruptcy with no hope. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case. And with the leadership in charge and being put in place it‚Äôs probably going to do very well with its financing plans moving forward. I‚Äôm still bullish on the price in the long run. So since I like the stock, I‚Äôm probably going to buy to multiply my shares and it‚Äôs a matter of where the next dip lies. That‚Äôs my take."

2021-04-13 01:14:01,wallstreetbets,"Yepppp.. I think a lot of people held and didn't sell when they were up a life changing (or at least enough to start making enough to be life changing) amount of money. All for the chance to play the small chance that it makes even more than the ridiculous 5-20x gains they already saw. 

I really hope it works out. Because if not, a lotttt of people are gonna regret not taking profits. I mean take a look at your situation. 300k isn't exactly life changing, but it's enough that you're sitting just a few good trading years away from $1M+ in the brokerage account and never having to work a day again. But only 35k... well that's a great start but could still take years just to get back to that 300k spot.

I hope the best of luck to you man. I respect you at least admitting you regret not making profit. I get it. I'm in the same boat. I made off decent, but nothing close to what I could be sitting on right now if I would've taken profit when I told myself to rather than listening to others"

I don't know what your trading experience is, but trust me. Being able to accept that sometimes you fucked up a trade (not that the entire market is against you) will transform your trading significantly in a positive way. Knowing when to cut losses is just as important as knowing when to take your gains. As they say, ""no one ever went broke taking profit."""

You're right about there being nothing in that article linked mentioning EDIT. Because I can't literally give you a gold sticker for reading here's a ‚≠êÔ∏è for reading the article. Here's a statement from [Broad itself](https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/broad-institute-harvard-and-mit-license-crispr-cas9-technology-editas-medicine-therapeutic), even their [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editas_Medicine), or [here because I like odd numbers](https://www.genomeweb.com/business-news/editas-medicine-provide-broad-institute-125m-crispr-funding). This now brings the total amount up to 5 different sources. 

> Getting a license is not the same thing as having the patent, so your post was misleading in this regard.

- To which I clarified that EDIT has the exclusive rights to commercialize it. I mentioned this in my original DD post as well twice. Broad retains the patent, and EDIT has the right to commercialize with their own products along with sub-licensing which they can collect a royalty from. I have provided multiple statements filed with the SEC that states this one from Broad, EDIT, and one from BEAM to provide an example of an existing license agreement. 

> Also, it should be noted that these are trials for drugs developed by Bluebird bio not Editas. 

- The original OP of that post never said it was EDIT, and neither did I. I agreed with both of you, and said it was a valid concern.

> Impacts every aspect of our lives: you just give a quote about the potential for therapies which isn't every aspect of our lives.

- Did you eat dinner today? Last time I checked food was a part of our lives. Ag-biotech is a huge thing, and crispr is already being used. I have a friend with retinitis pigmentosa who I talk to daily who could be potentially helped. That's an impact on his life. But, I have a feeling whatever I say you'll still find some way to shit on it. 

> What was that about not wanting people to know your personal finances? You still haven't given proof of these positions just tried to deflect away by saying you don't want people to know your finances.

- I conceded, and gave you a reason. I use Fidelity as my broker which includes the overall percentage of the portfolio. It's not the amount of shares I care about it's the overall value of the portfolio that I'd like to keep private because it's easy to do some basic math to find out. Frankly, I'm getting the vibe that whatever answer I give you wont be sufficient, and at this point I no longer care. For shits, and giggles I DM'd an uncensored version to OP that he has seen. If he chooses to verify that he's seen it that's fine. If anyone else wants to see it I'm open to sending it to them as a DM. If you choose not to believe me I don't care.

Look you're a smart dude. I typically enjoy conversations with people smarter than myself. I have provided multiple sources, and a writeup on my opinion. I've even entertained providing responses to your claims. If you want to call anything I presented shit then I'm open to having a dialogue about it. I'm game, and I'd enjoy it. But, calling me a snake, cherry picking statements,  and having a flame war is not a productive use of my time. If you think it's a productive use of your time reevaluate your life, and I'm honestly a little concerned that you care this much considering you have 0 skin in the game."

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Grayson-Moorhead Securities - losing our clients‚Äô money with dignity and pride since 1926 A message to our clients from the investment firm of Grayson Moorhead.

‚ÄúFar better it is to dare mighty things, even though risking failure, than to take rank with those timid souls who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.‚Äù - Franklin Roosevelt

Arthur Grayson: The last eighteen years have been difficult ones for our clients, but, oh, did they dare mighty things. Consider, for example, those who invested in our Twenty-First Century Tax Advantaged Select Growth Fund. I wish I had that kind of courage.

This fund, one of the boldest and most revolutionary ever launched on Wall Street, was intended to combine long-term equity growth, steady capital formation, reliable dividend yield, and minimal tax exposure.

[Graph shown of the investment losing money at a staggering rate, plummeting farther and farther into the red over time]

Unfortunately, it instead turned out to combine immediate capital hemorrhaging with flat or non-existent dividend growth, followed by a period of stagnation, then more capital hemorrhaging, and, surprisingly for a tax-exempt fund, extremely heavy back-end tax penalties.

In addition, many investors were referred for criminal prosecution by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and more than 7,000 had their identities stolen by the Russian Mafia, which had unwisely been given access to our computer system. Three had their U.S. Citizenship revoked.

Had you invested $100,000 in this fund five years ago, that investment would now be worth absolutely nothing, with a federal income tax liability of nearly $840,000. But you would have something more important than money - that you would have none of. You would have the pride of knowing that, though you failed, you had dared mighty things, unlike those timid investors who, in the words of the poet, know neither victory nor defeat. Although I suppose investors who placed their money with our competitors, and thus made a fortune, could argue they actually did, in fact, know victory. And perhaps, in a financial sense, they did. But they didn‚Äôt know defeat. That is something only our clients understand.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Psychology Vs Strategy In chapter four of his book¬†Blink, Malcolm Gladwell describes how Paul Van Riper, a retired Marine commander, drove the U.S. military to fits in a war exercise called ‚ÄúMillennium Challenge.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brilliant argument for the¬†plan-as-you-go idea¬†compared¬†with the traditional plan method.
The Millennium Challenge was an exercise designed to test the military‚Äôs ability to deal with a simulated war in the Middle East. It pitted a very large team (Blue Team) equipped with a very detailed battle plan, a lot of computer models and simulations, against a very small team (Red Team) led by Van Riper, experienced and self confident and good at making quick decisions.

‚ÄúBlue Team had their databases and matrixes and methodologies for systematically understanding the intentions of the enemy. Red Team was commanded by a man who looked at a long-haired, unkempt, seat-of-the-pants commodities trader yelling and pushing and making a thousand instant decisions an hour and saw in him a soul mate.‚Äù

As you‚Äôve already guessed, Blue Team is the might of the military, and Red Team is essentially one smart guy who starts with a plan and revises it constantly as the battle ensues.
When the game was actually played, Van Riper surprised the Blue Team quickly with a move not in its plans, and as they reacted to that, he surprised them again, and quickly caused considerable unexpected damage to a much larger force. It was all simulated and hypothetical, but the result was that the quick-to-react team with flexible planning beat the pants off the very detailed plan team that couldn‚Äôt react to changes.

‚ÄúHad Millennium Challenge been a real war instead of just an exercise,¬†20,000 American servicemen and women would have been killed before their own army had even fired a shot.‚Äù

That was pretty hard for the military to explain. They analyzed it a lot.

‚ÄúThere were numerous explanations from the analysts at JFCOM (Joint Forces Command Center) about exactly what happened that day in July. Some would say that it was an artifact of the particular way war games are run. Others would say that in real life, the ships would never have been as vulnerable as they were in the game. But none of the explanations change the fact that Blue Team suffered a catastrophic failure. The rogue commander did what rogue commanders do. He fought back, yet somehow this fact caught Blue Team by surprise.‚Äù

Implicitly, the problem was the big team full of computers and data trusted a static plan, while the other team didn‚Äôt.

Red Team‚Äôs powers of rapid cognition were intact‚Äîand Blue Team‚Äôs were not.

So relate that to the¬†planning we want: planning that responds to rapidly changing reality. Not just ‚ÄúDuh, I can‚Äôt plan, I don‚Äôt know the future,‚Äù and not just ‚ÄúWhy plan? Why bother‚Äù and not ‚ÄúWe have to follow the plan,‚Äù but planning as you go."

Quick decisions are stupid. Pick good stocks and hold them and have a target before you buy."
2021-04-12 21:02:46,wallstreetbets,"I assume we apes are the red team, and Melvin is the blue team. They can't plan for us, because we don't fit the traditional game plan or any of their pre-thought-out  contingency plans. Hold MFS!"

2021-04-13 16:24:06,wallstreetbets,Down a little.  But it was also the only position I was down today.  Still gonna hold it.

2021-04-13 17:37:36,wallstreetbets,"good for you.  I'll keep asking every dollar it goes up.

Assuming that it never returns to $15, do you have an exit strategy?

I'm long $30 calls (100 contracts) and short $24 puts (12 contracts) by the way, entered for a tiny net credit, all expiring Friday.   The most likely result is that everything expires worthless but I'm holding out hope for a run to $40 and a $100k profit on demo day.  Fun times tomorrow!!"
2021-04-13 13:57:05,wallstreetbets,Did you short tsla too?
2021-04-12 22:33:55,wallstreetbets,Its a software company right?
2021-04-12 22:27:47,wallstreetbets,What?  lol
2021-04-13 18:10:49,wallstreetbets,It's OK.  I'm not at a loss until 36$ since I factor this is my continuation of my short from 32 to 20.50. I do expect to cover around 15$ this time
2021-04-13 14:09:58,wallstreetbets,I am.  Haven't initiated the position yet. The run up is helping a lot though.  I will likely be looking to do this end of day or tomorrow.  If it rides over 750$ I'll initiate.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,VXX Options: Short Term Bet on CPI & Inflation Call ex 4/16 
2021-04-12 21:46:53,wallstreetbets,"**For anyone wondering why I'm doing this:**  
The VXX follows the VIX (known as the *fear index*). Although they correlate quite well, there are some differences, which I won't get into here. My wager is that volatility will *increase* in the short term, thus driving up prices on the call options.

High inflation may seem like an anachronism, but it's about to revisit us with force. It can be pure poison for growth stocks and causes higher short term volatility. Reason is that higher inflation raises pressure on the FED to raise interest rates. That in return, makes stocks and other equities less favorable to bonds and holding hard, cold cash.

As for the trade itself: When markets tanked in March 2020, the CPI (Consumer Price Index) also dropped. We now get to exclude that month for the new 1 year moving average, which will make rates jump higher. I'm betting the markets will get spooked ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)"
2021-04-13 14:44:01,wallstreetbets,What will the reverse split do to that?
2021-04-13 00:15:26,wallstreetbets,"This trade is insane and this is a like an impossible pool shot. Even if your theory is correct vxx might not spike because of short term futures decay among a variety of other reasons. You would have been better off buying options on the actual VIX for this one. 

But it's a real bet and deserves to be here. Congratulations retard you made all of us a little more smooth brained from this post."
2021-04-12 21:32:59,wallstreetbets,It's a one night stand with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
2021-04-13 14:48:31,wallstreetbets,No impact. Options prices will merely shift in accordance with the ETN's price after the split.
2021-04-13 01:20:31,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the input.

And yes, I'm a retarded contrarian. Going long on the VXX is financial kamikaze, so I'll be out shortly after I see how the markets interpret the CPI dump at 8.30 EST.

Re: choice of contract. I picked the VXX as it's highly liquid and a contract I'm familiar with. I do agree that options on the VIX itself may have been a better choice."
2021-04-13 01:39:55,wallstreetbets,I've traded VXX a lot. I usually just short it with good results.
2021-04-13 14:47:18,wallstreetbets,"Got out this morning at 0,35, which made me lose about $1.300. CPI inflation came in at 2.6, way below my expectation of 3+, so markets were relatively steady. Regardless, it was worth a try."
2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I hope tomorrow is better üöÄ 
2021-04-13 00:58:02,wallstreetbets,It's almost like hedge funds sold off today to stop the rally. It's almost like they are short aapl til next week.

2021-04-13 12:51:21,wallstreetbets,The announcement of the iPad that was just announced is also a medical play and ties into the information I gave the group on Abbott labs. The iPad numbers for quarter 1 2 and 3 this year will be remarkable. The fda approval for remote programming of spinal cord stimulators will benefit apple iPad and phone sales for some time.

After awhile you get more confidence and don't rush out. But congrats on making money and being on the right side of the trade.
2021-04-13 12:01:54,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm still fairly new to trading only been trying for a year the past month I‚Äôve finally seen gains but thank you for the advice üôè

2021-04-13 16:17:00,wallstreetbets,All good. We all should win.
2021-04-13 16:48:45,wallstreetbets,When you use calls that way have your solid price target for the expiration. And after a quick bounce back on Tuesday you should always let that happen its normal and look at profits you left on the table even if you had a 135 target for the week which I am looking higher than that. You we already to the good and in a breakout.

It's not because you're the only person who has seen this bit of her; it's because no one who has seen this bit of her has cared as much as you do.

The problem with having secrets like this is you start to think you are a secret keeper. You develop an ego. You think you see things others don't. You think you appreciate things others don't.

So when you start investing, you accidentally think you see a secret freckle in the market, and you go all in. The only problem is the market isn't a woman--it's, somehow, something infinitely more fickle and confusing. That freckle was a spot of make up, a ruse. You learn the hard way that the market doesn't love you for your attention like she does."

2021-04-12 20:53:49,wallstreetbets,"Here's an idea:

Let's try flooding the Melvin offices with physical letters. I'm talking literal millions. Doesn't have to have writing on it or anything, but I long as there are words on the paper in there they have to check it in case it's something important. No death-threats though, just stupid shit. 

You probably can't be sent to jail for writing letters to a corporation, at least until they make the first amendment illegal. But that's not happening until Melvin Capital uses their infamous spider-bots to trick the election machines to vote that Melvin Capital is the king, and the next big election isn't until next year so we should be good."

Just enjoy being in the moment and getting some fresh air. 

Coffee: go back in, put something funny on, and chill. You deserve it. üíù

If you have a call that is at the current price and costs $1000 just to get the contract then when it goes up to $1000 you made $860 per share or $86,000 less the $1000 premium so down to $8500 or so (assuming time is running out so the premium is gone).

If you buy calls that only cost $100 it is probably only going to be at about $200 strike price in most cases but let's say it is actually $300 strike because other people know the potential and bid towards it.  That means you have 1000 contracts worth $700 a piece at the end or $700k.  

You are less likely to lose big money on a close call though.  In that same example if it went to $300 you still got $16k on the first option and zero on the second"

2021-04-13 00:22:22,wallstreetbets,"Yea the joke was suing a hedge fund will go no where whereas i can at least shoot him without it being treated as a terrorist attack on wall st

Edit: to go deeper into my job (studying black market economics) contracts in black market economies between major players actually have less friction costs (negotiation, legal frameworks, maintenence) because contracts are enforced by threat of overwhelming violence, not the possibility of legal repercussions. This means that contracts with entities with established reputations of enforcing contracts are actually more trustworthy than most legal contracts, as bankers don‚Äôt usually rape then skin then burn alive your daughter if you miss a payment by 1 dollar.

Thats the level of enforcement these entities often have, 1 dollar short is enough to kill over because most product is moved on fronts to ensure liquidity in what is a fairly illiquid market with high transportation costs. So cartels and others will kill over that 1 dollar just to ensure that nobody thinks of running off with any of the product they are loaned.

Edit 2: high transit costs of product AND money, meaning that paying for goods is often as risky as selling them. In fact more enforcement budget goes towards intercepting money than product in law enforcement. So having the guy downstream assemble all the money for product he needs to still pay for makes sense in a risk management way. Plus if the guy who got fronted loses all the money and product, you can put him in debt and assume no liability for that loss."

2021-04-13 01:49:31,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll expand:

Go get a simple handyman or contractor license depending on your state requirements. Between the filing fees, bonding, insurance, and articles of incorporation it should run under 1k. 

All bid-action contracts are easily located through the muni and district budgeting committee. 

Begin an absurd amount of DD as you rip through thousands of scheduling books, architectural plans, and municipal code as you attempt to find areas you can reduce the overhead on.

Research your own cheaper materials to fit the projects while maintaining the lowest standards of structural integrity. 

Pay the fucken inspector yourself. First inspection should be simple, make them your friend. Go out for beers and dinner.

Glad hand the fuck out of them. 

Now all your inspections pass with out a hiccup, all the shitty modifications you‚Äôve made with awful material passes, and everyone gets paid. 

You‚Äôre going to need to hire a construction coordinator if you haven‚Äôt spent a decade around all fields since you won‚Äôt truly know how shit is supposed to be built versus how you know they will build it.

In a perfect world shit works nice and fast for a project to finish on time. The world isn‚Äôt perfect since most construction laborers are fucken dipshits. Each fuck up slows the next sub down and then all schedules get pushed back. Over and over. 

Need to know a lot. Especially how to treat the help."

2021-04-12 23:08:36,wallstreetbets,How does your wife not know where that money is lol. I don't want to judge another man's marriage but this dynamic confuses me.
2021-04-12 23:21:55,wallstreetbets,She's probably going to be pissed even if you make money.

i saw the first post you made and still can‚Äôt believe you didn‚Äôt tell her.

you probably think the ends will justify the means. people with that mentality say that shit to rationalize what they do or did that was wrong. it‚Äôs easier to say that to yourself than deal with the guilt or admit the wrong you did.

that‚Äôs your wife, man. how could you do that?

2021-04-12 20:29:17,wallstreetbets,"You must not know how finance works. If her money is included in the money, and he loses a significant portion then she loses money. Will it pay out? I believe so, but I also believe it is a long investment and not a short pop a lot of people were hoping for. If you think about it as a game of keep away, you will understand that the big players make significant amounts of money by simply playing with the stock market. It‚Äôs literally a game of keep away where the goal is to make you lose interest and quit trading stock."
2021-04-13 00:39:58,wallstreetbets,There's a lot of things outside of gambling. Such as one partner earns more than another can create rising tension. Who decides what happens to stimulus or big tax refunds? What about if a big tax debt is owed? What happens when one wants to make a big purchase and the other doesn't think it's a good idea? Don't be so naive.

2021-04-12 21:42:23,wallstreetbets,The squeeze happened already buddy. It was the $430+ spike. Anyone going in now is literally throwing away money on a $30 stock.

2021-04-12 21:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Riddle me this. How is their e-commerce platform going to be highly profitable. How can GME compete with native storefront on Xbox or Playstation. Even if they somehow managed to get an app to sell digital games on the consoles (which is pretty doubtful) they wouldnt be able to compete with the native storefronts because they have to pay xbox or playstation a 30 percent cut for every game they sell. Xbox or playstation also have no incentives to let them do this. So unless they are making a full pivot to PC games, selling console games digitally is going to be a bust for them, and selling physical copies online is a shrinking business.   


Even if they make a full pivot to PC gaming they would be going up against already established  players like steam and Epic games store. Its so hard to get people to switch pc gaming platforms already, what makes you think gamestop will be able to convince people who already own a ton of games on Steam and steam is where all their friends already are to switch. Other than that, they can sell hardware and increasingly move into the hardware space. None of that sounds very  groundbreaking though. Maybe they have a great plan, we just havent heard it yet."
2021-04-13 12:50:50,wallstreetbets,Pick up a map and compare the size of California to Europe instead. Maybe you'll learn something.
2021-04-12 22:44:58,wallstreetbets,How much of the market share do you think they need to capture to be successful? What people seem to miss is.... Not much. They only need a few percent and they're good. Also games aren't the only way forward. Your leaving imagination. Cohen came for the long term play. That's not WSB. But there are plenty of options of thinks to corner in the gaming market. When you sell shit people don't care where it comes from as long as it's a company they want to support. Win the hearts and minds of you customers and you'll be successful.

2021-04-13 09:03:58,wallstreetbets,"I'm just a retard. I think banks are on a fake bull run and are keeping appearances up until earnings where they will all just die.

I recon most banks are fucked due to the whole GME thing because they've been providing endless liquidity to Hedge Funds, Market Makers and others to just create synthetic GME shares that will eventually need to be covered. I recon all banks are over exposed on GME.

Because i think they are all over exposed on GME and that the Archegos hedge fund is just the first one in a row of hedge funds to blow up, i think banks are already in the red. If not, they will be in the red in the next month or two when they can't keep appearances up anymore.

I'm betting that they will take a massive hit NOW and not later though i'm starting to open puts slightly more far out in case they're going to keep this hype going for a while longer. I think it's all fake and they're in the shitter already.

That or i'm a complete moron."

The current echo chamber where people are betting exorbitant amount of money (real or fake) on 7 DTE OTM FD's (there is a reason it has that name) or because they see everyone else here talking about it was never what WSB was about no matter what some people on here will want you to believe.

These stocks that I bought were in the billions in terms of the market cap so mods please don't ban me again if one of these stocks drops below a billion. Two bleeped out for obvious reasons. The method to my madness was I clicked on a random stock and then I bought other stocks that other people had in their portfolio through the Robinhood thing on the bottom. I put so little thought into buying these stocks which was not smart in hindsight. There are more stocks in the red on my portfolio, but they are all under 1 billion now so I'm not even going to bother. I hope I wake up soon from this nightmare. Now you must be wondering how did a retard like me get all this money to throw away? I made a lot of money off of Palantir and other various trades, but mostly Palantir."

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cloudera $CLDR wth happened this afternoon, get in now! Cheap options... somebody knows something. $CLDR spiked about 6% today, literally moving 4M shares in a 5 minute period before dropping back to  around where it's been.

For the past several weeks volume has been around 2-4M a day, and from 1 to 105pm today 4M shares moved pushing it to 13.67 from open at 12.60ish.  

There is some talk about info that was re-announced today and the CLDR collaboration with NVDA.  But that doesn't seem to make a ton of sense for that move.    


There has been some talk about them being a potential acquisition target. Last year it seemed they were checked out by some VCs to potentially take private, some other boards seem to say things like mongo and snow are snooping around to potentially acquire. Who knows if there is any meat on that bone...  but the reality is options are dirt cheap on this thing.  $15s at the end of the month cost <10c.

With moves like this possible, and somebody moving in and buying 4M shares at whatever price they can at 1pm today... something could be up.  Options volume is a bit higher than usual for them and all bullish.

The stock itself seems like a fairly decent company that's already taken a beating from being tech and having earnings last quarter.... so yeah, they're already low hard to see a lower floor here.

TLDR;  at 1pm today (4/12) somebody bought around 4M shares at whatever price they could.  Reasoning is unclear, but options are cheap and stock is way beaten down if you want to try to buy some lottos on a stock that seems to be decent.

2021-04-13 02:53:02,wallstreetbets,"You're a bigger ape than King Kong, and I say that with love.

Listen my dear monkeys. In California today, the company that owns and operates Pacific Theatres and Arclight chains handed the keys over to all of their landlords and called it quits. And they did it just as the world is opening up.

Why? Well, it certainly wasn't because the theatrical exhibition business was wine and roses before the pandemic. It sucked, and it was getting worse. Theatrical windows are shrinking in favor of SVOD windows. Profits were getting harder to come by as attendance has been withering for the last fifteen years. 2019 was the third-lowest year in total ticket sales since and including 1995. 2017 was the second-lowest.

AMC is carrying $11 billion in convertible and non-convertible debt on its books. In May, its shareholders will vote to approve issuing 500 million shares of class A stock. This would give AMC cash to maneuver and operate but at the cost of diluting the share price. If AMC does not issue the stock, its ability to manage its debt and continue its operations will be severely limited.

As of March, the short positions are about 11% of outstanding/floating shares, so this isn't a short squeeze scenario.

While I appreciate everyone's enthusiasm for liking the stock, I fear this is not going to turn out the way you want.

I wish my fellow apes luck, and I am praying for you."

Looks like the next issue of the New England Journal of Medicine will have the Head-to-head with Psilocybin+SSRI vs. SSRI, to be released April 14th at 5 PM.

SSRIs are standard treatment for patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). One of the leaders of this study posted on Twitter last week and is teasing us

What's interesting is that the lead for this study is Dr. David Nutt, who also Leads CMPS' advisory board [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03429075?term=psilocybin&draw=3&rank=22](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03429075?term=psilocybin&draw=3&rank=22)

What's even more interesting is that CMPS was recently granted patents for this exact use case of psilocybin

2021-04-12 20:41:13,wallstreetbets,"I'll be honest & say that beyond they just beginning to understand that digital is the way forward I don't know exactly what their plan is. Because if it's just an online retailer shipping discs I think that will also be something which will be declining in the future. Neither developers nor platform holders really want the disc system to continue, not only due to cutting costs of actually physically producing them & shipping them, but also because second hand sales is something that side of the business doesn't want to exist. From a consumer POV it's also more convenient to just download & buy it directly, especially as internet speeds are ever increasing. At that point GME would either need to have their own digital distribution platform, but most hardware is already locked down by vendor monopoly on that end. Desktop is the outlier, but that's already pretty locked down at the moment as well, GME *could* perhaps make a dent there, but i think it would be very hard.

As for the physical side of things, Amazon as you say already exists, I'm not in the US though & we already buy from our own selected few online retailers on that end, so I don't really know enough on that end. The question becomes if they can take over enough of that segment to warrant their current valuation though, which from my understanding is still pretty dependent on the game side of things."

Converting old brick and mortar to profitable space AND continue to use it for limited product sales.  Also, GameStop SHOULD expand their market foothold and become a gaming development company which could have a proprietary game concept development division, game manufacturing, and proprietary accessory supply division, making GameStop not only a retail seller but also a game creator, developer and even limited manufacturer.  They could hire away some of the best game developers and, through customer feedback, create legendary games that their gaming base wants to play. They would have a near monopoly in the gaming industry!  RC is hopefully not just thinking out of the box, but out of many big boxes and can see the unlimited potential for GameStop!"

The bigger issue for the company is the huge hit their cash reserves are going to take paying the taxes on all those shares.  That was already going to be a problem, because that was the real focus of the 10-K discussion, and now that number is even bigger with Sherman's shares.

2021-04-12 21:03:41,wallstreetbets,they say its easier to make your second million than it was your first.  I guess you decided to go hard mode on that second million.

2021-04-12 23:04:59,wallstreetbets,AMC hasn't been higher when you take account they increased float and gme has been higher than the current price when you take into account their decreased float from buying back so many shares over the years.

If you spent the money in ways that dramatically changed your life it would be different for a little bit, but you‚Äôd quickly run out. Really the best way to use it is probably just a ‚Äúretire earlier than I would have‚Äù fund."

There are very good reasons to buy into nvidia.  But a 5-6% jump? That seems silly.  AMD and Intel dropping by about that much as well based on the same piece of news is equally silly.  I'm trying to figure out how much money I want to put into both of them with the current ""sale"""
2021-04-12 22:45:45,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao.  People do not understand Intels position at all.

All anyone wants to talk about is core count and them being beat to 7nm, but they just blatantly ignore scalable xeons and transistor density.

Intel's 14 and 10nm chipsets are competing against 7nm chips, because they have greater density, among other things, and their shift towards big.little for general computer is gonna get real interesting.

Not to mention their insane amounts of investment in storage.  You can have infinite compute power, but if you can't access the data quickly enough you may as well throw half your cores in the trash.

Intel is playing a LOOOOOOOONG game and the only thing people want to talk about is core count on Ryzen.

The fuck are you going to do on 64 cores?  Leave them all dark because your chips would melt otherwise.

Edit: Oh and they could very well be moving towards a foundry model as they dump 10s of billions into producing new fabs."

If you thought about it, or were capable any way, you'd quickly realize trying to sell video cards way above market simply keeps a niche market niche.  It actually makes perfect sense, you're a WSB idiot, you probably LOVE Tesla, a meme company, while having no idea that for actual production a company like Toyota sells more electric cars in a year than Tesla has sold in total the entire time it has existed.  
  
And that's fine, if there were no stupid people I'd just be average, thanks for continuing to do your part to make otherwise average folks like me look like towering fucking geniuses.  LOL."
2021-04-13 13:59:41,wallstreetbets,"Did I say anything even approximating that?  AMD has taken the Video card performance lead before, they have also taken the CPU performance lead both previously AND now, and in none of these cases did they decide to offer a ""top performance product"" that is/was DOUBLE OR MORE what their top of the line was the previous round.  Both Intel and Nvidia have done this.  You know anything about the server market?  Same situation there, thanks to Intel having a HUGE lead and huge market share, while the top of the line was something like $5k back when AMD was competing with Opterons, now Intel can and will offer you a $10000 chip.  ONE CHIP.  But not for much longer, AMD is competing in that arena again finally.  You need two of those $10,000 Intel chips to keep up with a single Threadripper, which is of course a much cheaper $4000-8000."
2021-04-13 13:50:17,wallstreetbets,"Certainly, this is capitalism, you can like whomever you wish, I was just pointing out facts that would normally make a consumer not want to support the likely future where they get ripped off, that's all."
2021-04-12 22:55:48,wallstreetbets,They also don‚Äôt understand the CEO just came from VMware and fucked with the licensing to hold AMD back hard in enterprise. Ent licensing hates AMD for core count reasons since things are moving away from sockets.
2021-04-13 03:09:09,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm talking about the processors, clearly you have no idea what‚Äôs going on."
2021-04-13 12:43:22,wallstreetbets,Yup same it's the 4S's that are on national backorder. I tried a few places. You might get lucky and fine a few strays. I was looking for 275/35 18s with no luck anywhere. Even the last pilot sport Cup 2s were sold out.

I would say, we will be in ASIC driven tech stack in next 5 years time. TPU is an example of early ASIC"
2021-04-13 03:12:39,wallstreetbets,Lmao y‚Äôall intel holders are so dumb.
2021-04-12 21:46:48,wallstreetbets,"AMD lost \~1% x86 market share to intel last quarter, it also lost market share to NVDA on the desktop gpu front.

There is a reason the stock price is dropping. Having a better CPU doesn't mean shit if you can't make enough."
2021-04-13 14:31:08,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't disagreeing, I was just echoing your point about hoping Nvidia is never the clear winner again from another perspective."

2021-04-13 13:45:11,wallstreetbets,"""data centers"" bro they literally say their ""data center"" tech is NOT general use computing and is specifically and ONLY USABLE for things like AI.  I don't know if any of you realize this, but Reddit.com doesn't use AI, nor does 99.999999999999999% of the web that currently ""uses server chips"".  Great, so Nvidia is getting into the low to no margin ""self driving cars"" market, similarly to AMD when they got into the low margin consol markets, it will be great to talk about during presentations but it will not being in major money, there are going to be too many companies doing it in house or preferring to put Apple's AI into their car, because your average person that isn't a nerd knows what Apple is brand wise but doesn't give a fuck about whatever an Nvidia is.  
  
And Nvidia branded ARM chips?  Great, throw it on the pile with the other 30 manufacturers of them.  Same story as above, unless Nvidia does something truly amazing they will AT BEST be on par with Apple's ARM with regards to AI and predictive computing, which Apple already has in working laptops people own, so you know, quite a lead there.  But I'm sure Nvidia will find a way to profit billion in that tiny margin sector."
2021-04-13 16:52:35,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll need the same size but 19‚Äôs. Sounds like I should start looking pretty soon. Thanks.
2021-04-13 10:48:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah it definitely isnt. And its suppose to be the card for developers in the first place even though nvidia advertises it likes its a 3080

Bro they just diluted a fuckton with the new acquisition. That ""down trend"" is a 35 billion dollar acquisition being priced in.  All the more reason to buy now.

Sure, share prices are still beyond fair value. But when the fuck has that mattered over the last several years?"

‚ÄúDiluted a fuckton‚Äù

New stock has not been issued that would account for the downward trend.

An acquisition is theoretically great for long term health. But is part of business activity that has no direct impact to stock price beyond speculative trading. With said ‚Äúacquisition‚Äù you might see a price increase due to more people betting on the success of AMD... but you didn‚Äôt so...

I specifically said that fundamentals AREN‚ÄôT the sole factor in determining stock price. Yet you defend it with... fundamentals. LOL

Whatever you‚Äôre smoking... you‚Äôre being a little bitch by not sharing.

Once again I‚Äôm not shitting on AMD... pointing out the most basic of observations of market movement over the recent 3 month period. Take that at face value."

If you sell a call contract and you get assigned then you have to cough up a 100 shares.  So if you wanna trade options I would start with the basics and just buy and sell options.  Start with small options to play around with, maybe on a paper trading account.  Buy to open, then sell the contract you bought then you have no risk for assignment.  Selling to open when you aren't completely sure what you're doing is dangerous."

2021-04-13 01:08:05,wallstreetbets,If they squeezed and made money then it wasn't a bad strategy. The bad strategy is not having an exit strategy and bag holding.
2021-04-12 20:35:12,wallstreetbets,"Literally none of you assholes gave a shit about GME back in December. Looking through deepfuckingvalue's previous posts, it's just full of asshole LAUGHING at him. And now you think you're a big time investor because you're riding on his coat tails? 

Tell me, what was the price of gamestop stock before all this mess? How many stores were they closing? Remember, before all this happened (which is not natural, by the way) hedgies were betting on this company going belly up. And they would've been right. 

Gamestop was a failing business that got lucky. That's it.

Edit: hey so, if I'm going to get downvoted without any actual discussion, I'll say this. 

Your man, Ryan Cohen's has zero experience in the video game industry. He's already kicked out Reggie, the former president of NINTENDO. Ya know, a company of value. Y'all are betting on him performing some miracle by making Gamestop the ""Amazon of games"" but that market already exists. It's called Steam. If you knew anything about the video game industry, you'd already know the hostility that gamers have towards the Epic games store. So, what makes Gamestop different or special in this regard? Not to mention that gamers absolutely hate Gamestop. So, there's a lot of good will that they're going to have to garner in order for anyone to buy their products. 

The market for online gaming is already flooded, what exactly are they going to bring to the table? Another platform where we have to download their shitty app in order to play it? Better hope there's no DRM because that will NOT go over well. But hey, at least he's good at selling dog food? 

Edit: a day later. 

Something I've just thought about. There are people who like to own physical copies of their games. And then there are those who don't care and are happy to buy digital only. 

So, let's focus on physical purchases. If they're really trying to be the ""Amazon of games,"" then they're going to have to be better at Amazon at delivering these games. Has gamestop spent the last couple decades building infrastructure to make same day delivery a thing? Are they going to be able to offer low or no shipping costs? I am all for a competitor to Amazon because they are in a dangerous place of being a monopoly. If gamestop wants to compete, what are they going to do differently? 

Digital purchases. What will they offer that's different from stores like Humble Bundle, GOG, Steam, Origin or Epic Games? Microsoft Game pass is literally netflix for gaming. To name a few. What exactly is their niche here? What are they doing differently? And where are they planning on selling these games? Because I doubt that Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft are going to give them room on their eshops. 

Ryan Cohen carved out a niche in the market because there was no competitor competent enough to do what Chewy did. I'm not denying that. That was a smart way of doing business and he succeeded in making his niche WORK. A fast, cheap and convenient way for pet owners to get pet supplies. I'm invested in Chewy because it is a good buy. 

Also, I hear they're going into cloud gaming. How will this be different than Google Stadia? Or any of the other countless video game streaming companies? I heard Microsoft is behind it, but then, that's Microsoft. Not gamestop.

E-sports? Really? Man, I hope they offer huge incentives for streamers because that market is ALREADY flooded. 

Gamestop was a failing business during a time when it's online revenue was up 300%. AMC had to go into debt to survive when it's revenue was cut by 100%. Despite that all of that, Gamestop was still failing. It was trading in the single digits. AMC, despite all odds, was still able to survive. So, what was Gamestops excuse?"

The squeeze happened and I'm sorry to say that everyone has become emotionally attached to the trade and that is usually leads to horrible losses.  It is supposed to be WallStreetBets but it has been overtaken by talk of one stock mooning that already mooned.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm betting that $ASO catalyst (JP Morgan Investor Conference) this week will lead to strong price action this week There's been a lot of DD surrounding ASO recently (I wrote one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mi07tr/dd_aso_options_ladder_is_enticing_high_short/) when it was $28.34, it has jumped up 10-20% since) corresponding to a 30% jump in price in the last month. With the current short interest at \~40% (almost all of which are underwater since they were borrowed when ASO was around $26 while the current price is hovering around $31) and the catalyst of the [JPM Investor Retail Conference](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/academy-sports-outdoors-announces-participation-222500004.html)  that they were invited to present at, which could expose this underrated stock to eager whales.

&#x200B;

[SI Interest as of 4\/12\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/zibna131srs61.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cd69d01b3947437e451219cd4a5865fc14249a2)

We could see a run upwards (due to media hype + retail hype, ASO is the second highest trending ticker on WSB some days) that puts pressure on shorts to cover. From the retail conference in 2020 (can't find for years before this), Lowes and Urban Outfitters presented, and in the week after their downward descents reversed and the stocks were up 17% and 32% respectively so there is light evidence that presentation at the retail conference can correlate to positive movement.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/swiaanadurs61.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e9e052f372e0dcd9f0e518950f31feab11ceceb

Along w/ all the other positive points (killed earnings, low P/e compared to industry peers such as Dicks, huge underwater short interest) I think this could spark another jump in $ASO's price as more heavy hitting investors are exposed to the stock and jump on board coupled with shorts covering due to no hope of the stock dropping to the prices they borrowed at.

2021-04-13 18:07:59,wallstreetbets,"May 21 35c are a nice price. I‚Äôd say 40 is a bit too greedy.

ASO always dips in the morning and bottoms out around 10 eastern, if you wanna pick up calls pick em up then."
2021-04-13 11:33:34,wallstreetbets,"They had super high debt, earnings estimates were half what they are now meaning the stock would theoretically be fairly valued or even overvalued, and futurists believe in a near term total collapse of brick and mortar stores.

Where I am it's not illegal, but it certainly isn't *legal*. But that doesn't stop them from same-day delivery. Hell, depending on the time I can get a ounce of weed in the same amount of time it takes to get food from a delivery service. 

Honestly weed delivery is just an easier business. With food, you can usually only get away with one delivery at a time, and you might go to many different places. Go to the restaurant, get the food, go drop it off, repeat. With weed, you just pick up a shit-ton prepackaged early, and can drive from customer to customer rarely needing to pick up. And you're only ever picking up from the same place, no need to figure out where you're going every single time."

2021-04-12 23:53:36,wallstreetbets,"I partially agree, but that causes issues. Lets just ignore the part where drug users can cause harm to other people around them, be it destroying a family, or leading to crime to continue their habit; that's a social/police issue, not a drug related one. That could be solved.

The issue is, if you blow all your money cause you're addicted to heroin, is it fair for you to receive the same amount of welfare as someone else? If you want to *choose* to do hard drugs cool, but once it becomes the responsibility of the taxpayer, society has some right to say ""no"". I live in a country with free (at the point of service) healthcare. If someone ODs on a regular basis, should I really be paying their hospital bills for something entirely preventable that they themselves caused?

At least with something like smoking and lung cancer, you could say you can't be *sure* their bad habits caused it. But a drug overdose is pretty clear, and it's fairly obvious you wouldn't need that same expensive care if you didn't fuck around with dangerous substances. If people are responsible enough to decide whether they should/shouldn't do drugs, then they should also be responsible for any reasonable consequences that occur. 

I'm fine if you wanna do coke daily if you're still a functioning member of society, but if you start shooting up heroin, missing work, get fired, and need to stay in public housing and survive off welfare, why should we reward bad behaviour by taking financial responsibility?"

Moviepass was never going to do well, the Movie Theatres could refuse to sign deals, revoke their ability to sell tickets (unless they paid full price - ouch) and just replicate what they did for easy money.

I certainly think it'll be a thing in the future, a subscription to the movie theatre is good competition with streaming services, and a customer base exists. But obviously it's more profitable when the company selling you the subscription is the same one selling tickets... a middle-man is just gonna struggle to make a profit, because they probably pay a similar price whether the seat is empty or not."

2021-04-12 23:59:52,wallstreetbets,Keeping it illegal has done everything you just said. At least we can use the tax money from those sales for some actual good.
2021-04-13 08:12:09,wallstreetbets,"You understand that when drugs are legalised, they can become extremely cheap AND high quality..... right? 

The whole argument that addict's need to steal to support their habit is a result of drugs being illegal and highly profitable for criminal enterprises to be servicing that high risk demand. 

In countries that have made the change what in reality happens is there is a SLIGHT uptick in users in the 1st few years, then a steady decline in long term addicts as they can more easily access support services and a marked drop in NEW users as real drug education is readily available instead of the BS scare tactics traditionally used.  

That's in a system were the government take over supply and distribution AND put some of the profits back into support services, education and harm minimisation.  It actually ends up costing the country LESS. 

It seems counter intuitive because we have been told all our lives that drug users are a ""burden"" on society..... which of course they are under a system that makes drugs illegal and let's criminals take huge profits out of the countries system while leaving the country footing the bill for the social costs!

As for your comment about smoking, the science is VERY clear that it causes a HEAP of healthcare costs that are shared by wider society.... the difference being that some of those costs are offset by taxing the product at point of sale. 

The same health costs can be clearly seen with obesity and unhealthy food..... why am I forced to pay for people's heart attacks because they personally choose to eat fatty and high sugar diets then have heart attacks! They made the CHOICE to eat in that way...... but why is it acceptable that wider society then shares the burden of their health care costs but not share the costs of drug users? 

The same for welfare, plenty of people on welfare smoke and eat terrible food and we are paying them so they can continue in their choices. Why should there be a double standard?"

2021-04-12 23:48:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, partially because they couldn't sign good deals with the theatre companies. They did in the beginning, and that was pretty successful... but the theatres realized they could just undercut Moviepass and do it themselves.

Moviepass still had to buy those tickets, even at a discounted rate. But the theatres themselves? They don't care, as long as they aren't displacing too many ticket-buyers. It creates brand loyalty, and since almost every movie you go to has empty seats (save for the big releases) it's free money for them. 

Moviepass could've been sustainable if they stayed small and mostly under the radar, but the VC greed for expansion meant they stepped on the toes of the movie theatres their business relied on. After that, they were screwed. You can't have a mutually beneficial relationship when they realize your entire business-model is built on a product that is theirs, and they know it's popular enough that it's not risky."
2021-04-13 07:27:25,wallstreetbets,Then they were trying to sell your data and not say anything. I figured it out after analyzing their traffic. Moviepass agreed to keep my card open until they died in exchange for not suing the hell out of them.

2021-04-13 15:34:54,wallstreetbets,">Why should there be a double standard?

I never said there should be... the difference is for something like Lung cancer you can't prove causation. With a drug overdose, you absolutely can.

I mean, I specifically brought up ODs for a reason and you didn't mention it once. No amount of harm reduction will completely stop ODs from occurring, and it's pretty fucking clear what caused an OD.

Having tax dollars go towards ODs would still piss people off. Yes, it will have tax income from those sales... but that doesn't change the fact that tax dollars are going towards it to some extent. If you could guarantee that all those OD cases and terrible outcomes would be funded *exclusively* by the taxes on drugs, that wouldn't be a problem; but that simply isn't the case.

>but why is it acceptable that wider society then shares the burden of their health care costs but not share the costs of drug users?

Neither is acceptable, that's my point. My whole point is both should be treated equivalently, we just don't because we all agree the negative health outcomes of eating too much junk food is nowhere near as dangerous as ODing on fentanyl... Or any other drug that either kills you, or leaves long-term damage requiring constant medical care for the rest of your life."

2021-04-13 19:13:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm not disagreeing with you about welfare and healthy food but the point I was making is that currently, obese people are free to keep making poor health choices with welfare money and society keeps picking up their healthcare costs.  

Its a double standard to accept that but then turn around and deny drug addicts welfare because they will/might spend it of drugs. 

Either BOTH are wrong...... or BOTH are right! I really don't care which side someone's opinion falls on, just be consistent and don't have a double standard! I get why it happens, we all have things we personally accept that others may not but if we are being honest with ourselves there are multiple situations around welfare and supporting poor personal choices that are the same concept. Yet when it comes to drug use, pretty universally we have all been taught ""drugs are bad"" and on a base level to hate drugs/drug use and that bleeds over to hate for drug users. 

Also, I'm not against SOME of the profits from drug sales going to schools, roads, tech and so on....... but that's also my FEAR that especially in the US political system were BOTH parties will see government supply and distribution of drugs as an extremely lucrative tax stream that they cant help themselves and give the supply and distribution rights to the private sector PLUS tax the hell out of it at point of sale and we go from a system of illegal high priced drugs to a system of legal high priced drugs.... Then couple that with both parties NOT investing any of the drug tax $ back into harm minimisation, support services, drug education and so on. Instead spending those sweet new tax $ on areas sure to get them re-election and we end up with a system that NEEDS to ensure drug users continue to be drug users and more importantly creates NEW drug users! 

Such a system would end up not decreasing crime related to drug use..... but in all likelihood INCREASE drug related crime as addicts still steal to support their high priced drug habit AND have virtually no support services to reach out to and start getting off drugs. 

To see real benefits from a shift in drug policy, governments really need to stop and approach this issue in a fundamentally different way! It can't be viewed with a profit motive at all, that path leads back to where we are right now! It needs to be viewed as a health issue that is able to fund its own reduction, recovery and care and bring about a real decrease in its current and future user base and THAT is the REAL financial gain society will receive as a whole across many sectors. Just think of the savings you and I will benefit from..... Reduced policing and incarceration costs, reduced insurance premiums, reduced healthcare costs, and it goes on and on and on once you start digging into it! The trickle down financial benefits across ALL of society are STAGGERING once we change our drug policy and actually start to ADDRESS the cause at the cause by helping and educating the user and potential users instead of our current reactive policy to trying to stamp out the drugs and only ever creating larger financial incentive for criminal enterprises to exist and service a guaranteed demand because of the government policy in place! 

Yes, by all means spend some of the drug tax $ on other sectors..... but for this to really work for society, we have to ensure that it also gets invested back into support services, harm minimisation and education so that in time drug use NATURALLY decreases AND ,the price\purity of drugs beat out illegal sources by a long way so as to destroy the financial incentive for criminal enterprises to exist in the sector. 

The aim should always be maintained on the only outcome that really matters - The organic reduction of existing drug users and reduction of potential drug users! 

We know this happens when drugs are made legal AND services are put in place to help and educate! 

I REALLY wish people, parents in particular, took the time to really understand this issue and bring about fundamental change at a political level! What we are CURRENTLY doing is creating the very problem that EVERYONE is scared of existing! And it costs society untold billions of tax $ each year dealing with it in its current form, only to see the problem get exponentially worse year on year! 

As counter intuitive as it may seem, if someone is really anti drugs..... they should be PRO drug legalisation AND ensure money from legalising drugs is spent back on drug user support services and REAL informative education of potential users! It is the only sure pathway to a REDUCTION of drug use, deaths, social costs and so on!  

Will it lead to ALL drug use stopping..... Of course not! But it will result in a real decrease in existing users, new users and a astounding reduction in the financial costs the current system has tax payers shouldering the burden of! 

I'm not pro or anti drugs..... but I am anti STUPIDITY! 1 thing we can all clearly see is that after a 40yr ""drug war"" the ONLY thing we have gained from it is a WORSE drug problem AND an exponentially increasing financial burden on society as we continue pursuing a failed policy that only ever ensures there is more incentive to supply illegal drugs! 

It is the height of stupidity!  

Enough is enough, we need to fundamentally CHANGE the way this issue is approched!"

I obviously **do** know how a business works, considering I run one. If we were able to skip the retailer and sell direct to customers then we would get over 2x the price as selling wholesale to retailers. Even after extra taxes being paid, and Uber getting a 30% cut.

2021-04-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Somebody lied to my portfolio several times and told her that she was fly, hot and sexy and beautiful and she's nothing like that. She's nothing of the sort. &#x200B;

As you can see, I started my stonk journey in February, and pretty much bought whatever looked good, at the time. First, I threw $10,000+ at GME on FEB 1 thinking, ""This can only go up! I'm gonna be sooo fuckin rich!!!"". It did not. Also bought a shit ton of AMC, thinking that ""if GME won't work, AMC will just pull a January GME, and send me to the moon. It did not. After that, I just bought whatever was up that day, thinking they would boost my amazing GME gains. Again, they did not. Last week I added ASO and VIAC to the dream team, hoping they would boost my portfolio, because they looked good. As you can see, they haven't helped much, as GME has been steadily tearing me apart since February. Oh, and I bought M, thanking that ""if retail is going up, it only makes sense that the biggest retail store in the world would moon, surprising even WSB, who wouldn't even see it coming. I was gonna be Macy's version of DFV. And, it has been going up most of the time, but it's not really helping me here, and has not mooned the way I thought it would.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[My second portfolio was meant to be a \\""side-portfolio\\"". Something that would make me some money, on the side. For some reason, my good buddy, KO has never failed me, but that's not much help, especially considering that I'm on the GME train, which has brought me nothing but pain, and regret. Lets see what happens next!](https://preview.redd.it/cnspm83nors61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ef1176e19c7b18bdeff52180e7cf8a10481fcc)"

2021-04-13 01:09:54,wallstreetbets,GME isnt over bro.  Remember when it dropped from 450-40 and then rocketed to 350.  It hurts now but be patient.
2021-04-12 20:37:45,wallstreetbets,"I still am, but I can't hold out much longer. I've been hearing ""it's gonna moon any day, now"" since February, when I bought in at $225. At this point, I don't think we can take on a huge hedgefund with full industry, media, and govt. support. At this rate, I'll lose everything in both accounts, watching them push GME down every day. I might as well get out, start buying stocks that go up in short bursts, and get out with some profits, rather than hoping for a huge windfall that may or may not happen. That's what happened when people bought RKT in March, and they made money. With my luck, GME would probably go to $1,000, the day after I sell, but I'm just not into it anymore."
2021-04-12 23:05:36,wallstreetbets,"You should read more dd. We‚Äôre currently in the end game, but if there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs guaranteed, it‚Äôs that rich people reeeeeeally don‚Äôt want to give up their money. They‚Äôre fighting it every step of the way. It might pop tomorrow and it might pop in 8 months, and when it does, anything below 1000 is going to seem cheap. It might trade below 20 until then. 

Right now their strategy is route all buy orders through dark pools that they can enforce strict control of the price with, and all sell orders through public markets to drive the price down. Thing is nobody is selling, buy orders are outpacing sell orders by a massive margin. 

There‚Äôs *a lot* of DD out there. If you read it and think ‚Äúthis is incorrect,‚Äù and you no longer believe in the possibility of a squeeze and you don‚Äôt believe the company can be a success story, that‚Äôs a great reason to cut losses and move on. But doing it because you‚Äôre scared, you stand to lose a lot of money for no reason. 

Obviously make your own decisions, but like... just consider them carefully first, and do your best to make decisions based on evidence and expectations, and not fear."

Also, after seeing people hoard toilet paper, he didnt want the same to happen to masks while hospitals were struggling to provide ppe.

Then when new data arrived that proved mask effectiveness, he changed his mind because thats what good scientists do. He wasnt stubborn and listened to science.

But sure, keep thinking you know more about public health than millions of public health professionals and doctors worldwide who state the benefits of wearing masks.

Also, lol, its sad and funny you think he was ‚Äúordered‚Äù to change his mind. By who? cheeto in command whose base hates masks? big mask companies? qanon? you are the perfect example of the dunning kruger effect. i hope you become smarter"

2021-04-13 14:59:09,wallstreetbets,"I mean, at least they are wholesale focused. However they paid millions and millions to be in the markets they currently operate in. 

One day soon it will only cost LPs like Aphria the cost of shipping to enter those same markets. Their Candian and Europe markets are just solid additions to the much bigger picture once the US is opened. Europe and the US are expected to be the biggest market. TilAphria already has the largest EU footprint , which is expected to be **bigger** than the US by 2025, according to Curaleaf and some analysts. Adding the US sales to established EU and CA sales is going to be massive. They will have access to the massive US market for the cost of shipping. 


At least Cresco is also wholesale focused (Like LPs) and are ready to tackle a large national market. Other MSOs who are retail focused are going to find out that even a store count of 70 is going to look miniscule to the thousands of new stores opening across the nation."

2021-04-13 15:21:36,wallstreetbets,">A company encouraging shareholders to vote on upcoming action is perfectly routine.

Just because it is routine, doesn't make my counter point any less valid. The votes haven't been tallied yet and the decision to merge hasn't been finalized as far as all the shareholders know. You should probably smoke some weed and chill out instead of trying to show you aren't smooth brained (because it is not working)."
2021-04-12 20:34:06,wallstreetbets,"I'm not trying to say that there won't be successful pot companies, just that they're currently being priced as if either the wholesale price of weed isn't going to drop significantly, which it will, or the market for pot will greatly expand, which it won't."
2021-04-13 15:23:29,wallstreetbets,"It does. You act like them asking shareholders to vote means they are worried about the votes, then admit it's routine.

2021-04-13 14:43:40,wallstreetbets,"The lowest I've seen biomass in an oversaturated legal state market was ~.07/g for trim, and ~.20/g for bud. 

Even at ~.07, it seems there would be much more money per lb for cannabis versus tobacco. $2lb vs $22lb. So there's plenty of room for that price to fall much lower, if the market was open and legal for everyone. Making derivative margins even sexier, like Aphria's Sweetwater, but anyway..

There's also no reason for large farmers to ever care about quality. They can easily pull in multiple harvests in one growing season using auto flowers, and treating them like any other industrial crop, minus the pesticides. Although with biomass, the pesticides don't really matter, mostly. It's easy to remediate material and remove any pesticides when converting to a concentrate, which is what biomass is used for anyway."

I have a cash and margin account with Webull and in my cash account I often have to wait >1 week to make a trade after I make a deposit because ACH transfers take time and I don't have margin in a cash account.

Can we agree if money borrowed with interest is a margin account? 

What do you think you are correcting?"
2021-04-12 21:45:21,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been in and out for profits. It bounces every time it hits new lows so that‚Äôs been my play. I‚Äôd like to get a few hundred free shares and let it sit. They have a lot of competition and their valuations got real high, but I like it in the $50‚Äôs for long term."
2021-04-13 00:54:54,wallstreetbets,"The stocks going to IPO price. I shorted it @75 and sold my options to lock in profits but I still think it is there.

I would have literally gone all in puts if I knew the stock existed @150. 

It's a consulting company valued as tech.

Their margins are in alignment, but their growth isn't their. The platform is going to get dominated by PLTR.

I can try to find my valuations of both of them. They were from last earnings though, so if another 10q came out, my data isn't worth it.

Edit: I shouldn't say that the stock will go to any price, but my valuation model said so and thats largely based on a ton of assumptions, which I then traded on, made around 20% on shorts and I dunno what the final percentage was. Theta was starting to get high so I closed.

I usually long/short companies in same sector. My long was pltr which I was entering via csp.

Thank you for my TED edit"
2021-04-12 22:18:35,wallstreetbets,^ this!! I‚Äôm holding 500 shares of PLTR & 600 of AI.
2021-04-13 09:34:43,wallstreetbets,"Being in the Air Force, I know we're partners with both AI and PLTR and have seen their tech first hand. This is why I own both. Pretty amazing technology these companies provide for us."
2021-04-12 20:59:18,wallstreetbets,"I also did a DD on this, particularly shipping container leaser stocks like $TGH and got ridiculed and bitched at that XYZ product don‚Äôt get shipped in containers blah blah. These stocks have grown and have continued to prop up my portfolio performance to help cover weaker areas. I agree these stocks will continue to grow in the long term as global trade supply demand rises in the pandemic. I will definitely look to add some of the sector names you mentioned to my portfolio."
2021-04-12 20:09:16,wallstreetbets,NMM is where it‚Äôs at
2021-04-12 23:25:12,wallstreetbets,I made a killing on EXM and DRYS back in 2007/2008. This looks interesting. Will have to look into it further. Thanks!
2021-04-13 06:03:02,wallstreetbets,"I went all in ZIM, DAC, and NMCI (now NMM) when you posted your first analysis.  Been following your twitter and trying to learn from you and some of the other accounts you interact with.  

You've made me a lot of money, and despite a few selloffs, it keeps going up. 

Thank you, from a mariner stuck at sea."
2021-04-12 22:04:47,wallstreetbets,"Nice update. I'm following this industry closely as well (not that many of us), although I'm focused on dry bulk and the Baltic dry index. Seems Capesize could jump to 100'K before the end of this year. Now, as you pointed out though, dry and tank is extremely cyclical, and way more so than container.

Bought some BDRY and GOGL a while back, but might need to dip my toes in the container-waters if this keeps up.  
PS: If you haven't done so yet, check out the Cleaves' estimates for 21-23'. Very bullish sentiment across the board."
2021-04-12 22:05:30,wallstreetbets,"What are you thinking about other players like Maersk, Hapag Lloyd? Compare to Maersk ZIM is a small player in the industry. I was thinking to buy some Maersk but would like to hear your  opinion, as well."
2021-04-13 01:20:38,wallstreetbets,Been watching since 35$. Sold my shares by accident for pocket change. And kicking myself since then
2021-04-13 01:29:06,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt you think that the stock price is reflective of harper shipping rates and if they STOP going up that the price will start to descend. If they even stabilize the price might go down?

I noticed a week or so ago the velocity of the shipping rate was slightly lower than normal and I felt like DAC sold off a bit


Also looking at the various companies which ones have ships coming off charters so they can re lease them out acts as a supply constraint"
2021-04-13 01:44:06,wallstreetbets,What do you think about actual container ship builders? Any you would recommend? I saw HII
2021-04-13 11:16:29,wallstreetbets,What is your price target for ZIM?  With the current pullback I am tempted to start a position after reading your DD and looking at the company myself.
2021-04-13 11:27:48,wallstreetbets,Right now most of these tickers look like they just mooned and will be dropping. At least that's certainly what will happen if I buy any!
2021-04-12 22:58:00,wallstreetbets,Glad to hear you had conviction and bought some good names earlier!!
2021-04-13 12:36:28,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service!
2021-04-13 13:56:04,wallstreetbets,Glad to see it's going well!
2021-04-12 22:57:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah dry bulk sentiment is warming up for the insiders. Broad market not yet. Keep in mind BDRY is just a futures vehicle, it is *not* an actual shipping company."
2021-04-12 22:56:10,wallstreetbets,"I spoke about it in more detail in a webinar on my YouTube channel last week. Generally if ZIM was valued like comps they would be $70-$80+ and ZIM is already in a huge alliance with Maersk and MSC, the worlds 2 biggest liners."
2021-04-13 13:59:32,wallstreetbets,"Sorry to hear, but glad you made a small profit at least. Lots of other names still cheap."
2021-04-13 13:58:13,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps? 

Those are 1-year shipping quotes though (and 2-3 year rates are now very similar), so if the rates did go down, that doesn't matter much for the firms who have already done a great job of rolling their fleet over.

This isn't a spot reading like tankers or bulkers."
2021-04-13 13:57:25,wallstreetbets,"Not a fan of that business. Very government subsidized, loss-making in many cases. Getting better with recent mergers in Japan, Korea, and China, but there also aren't many liquid stocks to invest into.

I keep it simple with the ships."
2021-04-13 13:54:34,wallstreetbets,Currently looking at $40.00 as a 'fair value estimate.' Need to see official Q1-21 results (in a few weeks) and updated 2021+ guidance to see if $45-$50+ is more appropriate (or not).
2021-04-13 13:53:59,wallstreetbets,"You have the kiss of death, huh?

If you think 2-3x P/E is too high than by all means..."
2021-04-12 22:59:01,wallstreetbets,"Disruption is almost always good for shipping, but hoping for the best outcome over there!!

I try to hit the vitamins, ha!"
2021-04-12 21:35:27,wallstreetbets,i promised i'd never tanker gang again but ugh here i am getting brought back in
2021-04-12 20:45:39,wallstreetbets,"Have been on this train a bit myself. Admittedly, I should have been trying to swing trade them (with the exception of $GSL) as I'd have come out further ahead on the others if I'd just held.

Tendies should continue awhile longer."
2021-04-13 07:09:37,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll listen webinar and follow you since I used to work in the industry and like logistics, would like invest some. Thank you."

2021-04-13 08:19:19,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for making me feel better about my losses in the last two months.  Sucks donkey balls watching one of my tickers drop 10 days in a row, most around 10%.  Even when it's green almost 10% premarket, it somehow ends the day closer to -10%.  Realized going in it was volatile, but 10 days in a row??  FUCK ME.  It's times like this you really got to remind yourself why you got into it in the first place and stick with it, average down, sell some CSP.  Sometimes doing nothing is also a strategy, but fuck is it ever hard to do.  Telling people to remove emotions from the equation is easy, but having the discipline to practice it yourself is much easier said than done."

We'll be OK. Hold on. Don't panic. Maybe leave it alone for a few days. I used to sportsbet heavily....learned a lot about handling downside.

They where mostly catering to boomers retirement accounts until recently when hundreds thousands moved to them n others from robinhood.  Now with 200k+ accounts opened by younger people like myself I see them offering a different version of app for anyone born after 1940s n want a better app but like the brokerage

2021-04-12 22:14:19,wallstreetbets,"Making a small bet and tracking it for fun is fine.  I had some.  But I cant believe the people who have bet everything, 401k, all of it on GME.  100k or more.  And most have no price target or exit strategy.   So could end up fine, or quite possibly end up a life changing loss.  Individual stocks do not always recover, contrary to thread belief.  I was around, and I can name a dozen tech stocks that went parabolic during the tech boom and now aren‚Äôt around.  I really hope it works out."
2021-04-12 22:19:21,wallstreetbets,"when there is small volume and the price goes down 20%, margin calls come in.  Call Options become worthless.  It can happen on the upside, but downside too.  Remember, even after the big jump this stock went back down to $40.  And there werent a lot of buyers at 40."
2021-04-12 23:24:30,wallstreetbets,"I can‚Äôt wait for the GME stuff to end. I locked in most of my gains and have 20 shares left that I‚Äôm letting sit as a lottery ticket, but I don‚Äôt care. I just want to read something other than GME.

I stupidly should have sold, instead sold covered calls and it has since then dropped even further. now I am out 450, wiping out my entire profit from today and I am still debating if I should sell. I remember strongly considering selling when I was only down 130. But I didn't"
2021-04-12 23:33:00,wallstreetbets,"Seriously bro. Its so played out at this point and the shit people post and believe about it in this sub is behind absurd. Its hilarious to me that this whole sub literally thinks they are at war with hedge funds and everyone that says anything bad about the stock is some sort of operative working for Melvin. They are still talking about short squeezes and gamma squeezes like all of WSB is going to be able to sell for $10,000 a share somwhow. They don't realize nobody in the investment world actually gives any fucks about it except for them and they are just selling shares to dumber and dumber bag holders at higher prices. I wish the mods would at this point at least keep all the GME talk contained to the daily megathread. Why is there even a megathread if every post in the sub is about GME? Its beyond retarded in all aspects at this point."
2021-04-12 22:23:35,wallstreetbets,Wat company u trade with I did use robinhood till January then transfer to fidelity n they say open for options when u open account then u need to apply to trade options there. You know a legit  brokerage that let's u trade off start but decent enough that if u get assigned itll exercise your puts to cover type company
2021-04-12 23:20:44,wallstreetbets,Good man!
2021-04-13 00:37:45,wallstreetbets,I appreciate you. Please don't stop I need insulation for my cardboard box.
2021-04-12 21:18:32,wallstreetbets,That's the goal
2021-04-12 22:27:07,wallstreetbets,"Here's a good way to think about it... Imagine that instead of being in the trade you're in, that money was currently in your account and you didn't own the shares. Would you use that money today to buy the shares of $APHA at its current price or would you think about some other trades instead? If you wouldn't buy the APHA shares today then you should sell them. It doesn't matter that you bought them for or when (unless of course you're thinking about holding periods for tax purposes but that doesn't sound like a factor here) What's happened in the past is already done. Where you're at now is where you're at, every day you start fresh with a balance and/or shares and try to make sure your money is in the best places for gains.  Each day that you keep holding a beaten down stock you're betting on that stock to be the one that's going to take your current account balance up or down from its current level. 

Sometimes sitting at a loss is fine if you truly feel that your money is parked in the best place you can find to park it for future profits. But if you felt like something like $NVDA or another stock had a better chance of future profits than $APHA does, don't let the fact that you're currently holding it or you've already lost money on it keep you from selling it."
2021-04-12 23:41:08,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, I‚Äôm interested in how long this continues. This has already surpassed the attention span that I thought this sub would have, but I guess several million people joined this sub for GME and likely have too big of a financial stake in it to not be obsessed.

I hope it rockets, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath."
2021-04-12 22:27:03,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood just watches u crash n burn if u get hit around expire I herd fidelity would automatically exercise your bought puts to cover sold
Eg.
 like the Tesla 30k+ losses everybody took when the puts printed n didnt kno until their puts expired worthless n had to buy 100 shares"
2021-04-12 22:42:38,wallstreetbets,"i get it. but i have at most 2% of my available trading bucks trapped here. so for me, its not money i need. I can keep trading and meeting my goals while sitting on this loss. i think i just hate losing money on any thing I buy (not necessarily optimal money-making strategy). I just checked, I have only ever lost money on 12 out of 80 stocks I have traded since I started 7 weeks ago. 

Apha and GME are the only ones > $100 loss."
2021-04-13 03:13:50,wallstreetbets,"You are right.  Also, realized losses are tax deductible."
2021-04-13 00:03:39,wallstreetbets,"That's exactly what's happening. Too many people balls deep in losses that keep holding on to a fake narrative. Its just going to be a slow bleed out from here. As more people's calls expire worthless, more people's leveraged RH accounts hit margin calls and more people come to their senses after seeing massive losses there won't be anyone left to sell to. Certainly nobody that actually knows what they are doing will be willing to buy.

2021-04-12 20:00:58,wallstreetbets,TD app is not bad
2021-04-12 20:26:33,wallstreetbets,"Is this a dip worth buying into if you're sitting at zero GME? Seems like a good dip since it dropped like $30 recently. Still trying to understand the mechanics of a trade, though. In after hours trading, is it best to set a market or limit order? I was hoping to catch a dip under $100, but under $150 doesn't seem too bad either."
2021-04-13 11:11:18,wallstreetbets,"Couldn‚Äôt agree more , ever since this whole Ape stupid shit WSB has been crap :/ , sorry to say but we‚Äôve lost something great."
2021-04-13 08:37:30,wallstreetbets,The point is to avoid brokerages that stepped in and prevented the squeeze last time by restricting buying. TDA was one of them unfortunately
2021-04-12 22:22:02,wallstreetbets,"Thanks.  Do they offer ""free"" trading, options, and fractional shares? That's what I'm looking for.  Right now I'm using webull for my play money and fidelity for the others.  I'm not entirely satisfied with either."
2021-04-12 20:41:47,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't go balls deep with it because it's volatile.  Realistically $150 could turn into $180 in less than 4 months that's 20% increase in 4 months better than savings but definitely more risky.

Being realistic too, I think it could still drop to $60 before it goes back to $150 then to $300.

My believe is that it will see the $300 in less than 3 months. Will it?  It all depends whether  there's enough whales that want to make money."
2021-04-12 20:28:55,wallstreetbets,"Could you be more specific about how the platform cost you money in trades? I know they haulted trading during the initial squeeze, but they were quicker to get trading back up. It sounds like most of your problems are with the customer service. I haven't had any issues with webull personally, but I'm admittedly very green when it comes to trading and welcome any opportunity to learn something from a more experienced ape."
2021-04-12 22:41:26,wallstreetbets,"WeBull did the same and pulled the plug on GME. TD offers free trading, options but not sure about fractional shares"
2021-04-12 20:46:30,wallstreetbets,"Fair assessment. Thanks for sharing!  I'm still new as hell to this and am just after one or two stocks to start with, then diversify in other stuff. What resources were most helpful to you in learning to trade well? Tooling seems to be really important to stay up on the market."
2021-04-13 00:05:31,wallstreetbets,"Basically their trade ticket wasn't working at all, so I couldn't close a position when I needed to.  Nothing at all related to GME actually, just an unreliable platform from a fake brokerage.  Their ""support"" was worse than useless, so by the time it randomly started working again, the opportunity was gone and with it my money.

Their lack of customer service was/is definitely the most glaring issue though.  This is a company that's asking us to trust them to hold onto a lot of our money and assets, so having knowledgeable and accessible customer service is a basic requirement that they don't even try to meet.

None of that shit is even remotely okay for a brokerage.  Webull is a fake brokerage just like Robinhood.  If for some reason I could only choose between using one of these two, I'd hold my nose and pick Robinhood.  At least they're not backed by Winnie the Pooh."
2021-04-12 23:04:32,wallstreetbets,"Webull communicated the issue in a timely manner. Robinhood lied twice and waited days for a more accurate explanation.

Good to hear about td tho.  Apparently they don't offer it yet, but are being bought by Charles Schwab which does."
2021-04-12 21:42:21,wallstreetbets,"Oof, I haven't made it. I started 1 GME at $330 Jan 29 and have been averaging down, but I also smartly skipped the dip at $40 and currently I'm stuck at $3700 invested with a current value of $2K.

Most things I assume to have knowledge of now is based on comments here, Google searches and past mistakes. For instance one of them says that Monday is best day to buy.

One of my other theories is a climb leading to 4/20. Or that the stock won't come down much more lower than $120 again this year

My favorite is the believe in a more perfect W line. Ignoring the 3/24 dip and adjusting the chart you should see the start of the W on 1/27 the second peak 3/10 and a hopeful peak on say.. between 4/20 through 6/9 at $600+."
2021-04-13 07:34:04,wallstreetbets,"So, what's the catalyst that will cause whatever you're looking to have happen? The other side has survived an enormous rally, congressional inquiries, etc, what will finally make the squeeze happen?"
2021-04-13 07:40:29,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôre also down 50% over the past quarter, which is huge for a hedge fund.

This isn‚Äôt an overnight single-switch mouse trap, but a  gradual war of attrition. Who won the Cold War? Was it Reagan or Chernobyl?

When ‚Äúthe other side‚Äù finally trips, it‚Äôs not about what we did to make them fall, but whether or not anyone could possibly help them back up."

2021-04-13 03:29:17,wallstreetbets,"I don't know what you meant, it looks like an X in a box after you said term. Or perhaps you mean the word retard? I understand what you mean, and you are a good bloke, however I refuse to be afraid of using a word in good fun. In a setting where it seems to be used quite often.

If you wish to hear why I genuinely feel this way. Please do read on. 

You think perhaps I should say moron instead? Well that as well used to be a medical term to classify people with low intelligence, idiot... I don't think that one was medical but it is another word to describe a mentally lacking person.  Mental acuity is determined largely by genetics you see, so in a way idiot just as well as moron is just as hateful as retard. We can all work hard and study but every one of us has a mental cap. So making fun of even a dumb dumb (someone who isn't that stupid but more often than not makes stupid decisions) is making fun of a person who can't help be a dumb dumb. Just as much as I can't help being white or male or a mentally handicapped person can't help being mentally handicapped. You prefer perhaps I say ape? Being used just the same as people would have used the word retard in the past. Isn't that just replacing the word with another but still having overall the same meaning? Therefore, I will use whatever colorful language I desire, for the sake of being funny and maybe giving some of my fellows on the only subreddit I really use daily a light chuckle. 

I will express though that when I see a mentally disabled person I wouldn't ever call them a retard and to be honest I don't even think of them as a retard. To me, retard is a word with origins, of course, but now really just means a really big poo brain. 

If you don't like me for that it is your right, just as, for at least today, at least this moment, it is my right to say what I want. Don't worry, in the future when what words we are allowed to use and aren't is much more heavily enforced, you will have a sweet little giggle knowing I'm a grumpy boy about it. Probably in a prison somewhere with my mouth locked closed with other major criminals... Press that asked too many questions, guys who whistled at a woman, and anyone who didn't take their mandatory mood stabilizers after being warned by their home terminal three times in a row."

Like the idiots buying 800c on GME. Wasting money because the price it would need to hit to get a decent return was way beyond 800. 

Usually, the best way to make money on options is to spend quite a bit of money on them. I'm hoping for a 500% return on an investment but I put 10k in. So my hope is to come out above 50k. Puts are safer but usually need more capital in reserve to make that money and satisfy margins."

Thanks for explaining your point. I disagree.

You don't have a choice because the government is the controlling power.  Right or wrong, they have a monopoly on legitimate force. Governance isn't ownership.  It's very different.

>Companies have to abide from the government as well; it‚Äôs how the government is able to do a lot of things and have minimal repercussions. 

Again, being governed isn't being owned.

>I can‚Äôt provide evidence or answer the questions you have because you‚Äôre not asking any; you‚Äôre telling me things but I‚Äôm only guessing on what you want to know/hear.

As I pointed out awhile ago, the only way you come to the conclusion that government owns businesses is by using a very different definition of ownership than most people."

Inflation has been a real thing and it always will be. It‚Äôs been artificially low for a hell of a long time actually.

2021-04-12 20:19:52,wallstreetbets,Home building is most likely causing the supply shortage. My neighbor paid about the same for his roof that I did ten years ago. The crew that installed it was 99% immigrant. Their substandard wage is what keeps a lot of inflation from occurring. If immigrants were all removed magically overnight and all manufacturing were ordered to be done here then you‚Äôd see runaway hyperinflation. Goods costing more has more to do with shipping costs right now. Concentrating money into the hands of the wealthy doesn‚Äôt create inflation. And people saving the stimulus doesn‚Äôt create inflation. People getting paid more causes inflation. Which still isn‚Äôt happening.
2021-04-12 20:21:49,wallstreetbets,"Inflation does not trickle down evenly everywhere. I recommend you speak to home depot, circle back after."
2021-04-12 22:31:11,wallstreetbets,"Good points about rich not causing inflation in most places. It does occur in real estate from wealthy Americans and from Europeans and Chinese investing in the US. In China their home prices have gone up incredibly in the past 15 years and same with India. With safety in the US people are inclined to owning in the US. Might be a big disaster waiting to happen and is pricing out regular people. 

It‚Äôs crazy to witness home price inflation acting like stocks when they should be acting more like stable bonds."
2021-04-13 05:55:05,wallstreetbets,Whatever the market will bare. Other countries may be bidding up real estate in major metro markets and that could be tipping the overall scales but I have not seen or heard about a Chinese or Russian multinationals purchasing single family homes in the suburbs or middle America. It seems like everyone is obsessed with the near zero rates and want to buy buy buy while it‚Äôs still low cause everyone‚Äôs convincing themself that rates are going to rise soon. I don‚Äôt think rates will rise soon and when they do they will be very slow. A sharp rise would absolutely sink the markets.

2021-04-13 15:09:49,wallstreetbets,Splunk has already blown its load.
2021-04-12 20:25:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I could say the same thing about AWS or Azure and it would be true. They often release new features that aren't quite thought out, have inadequate documentation, sample code, or integration with their other database offerings or design patterns. But alas, we live in an imperfect world. I think they will rapidly meet demand as they have with everything else.

*edit, spelling"
2021-04-12 20:33:02,wallstreetbets,"And sorry, you asked me about their 'push to Splunk Cloud sub models and away from enterprise': 

Ofc this is just my personal opinion, but I believe Splunk learned the hard way that having people run their own on-prem shit is actually kind of complicated. Depending on the setup of their environment, load balancers, specific heavy forwarding needs-- and generally, how your company runs on Splunk-- are all kinda based on people configuring and managing something correctly that they don't know about and aren't really incentivized to learn much about. All that leads to performance problems for end users which reflects poorly on Splunk. I forget if Splunk had any notion of burst pricing, but they could definitely do something like that someday and really drive down costs for users with Splunk cloud as well (not sure why they would do it though unless it really was a reason for losing business)."
2021-04-12 20:51:31,wallstreetbets,"Yep! 
Totally agree, and once a firm installs splunk, it is very difficult to remove it, but migration is very possible to cloud. I think its vendor partnerships and vendor created addons in its ""marketplace"" are also a big step I havent seen with other seims (maybe elasticsearch)

What i do see, is that most major corps pay splunk contractors, they dont keep staff on hand, but contracts will go on for years and years (lots of gov using splunk and contractors too)

Id say, although in my personal opinion (that of a splunk contractor) its looking like i might need to find another seim. But what seems clear is that this is something corps want to outsource. Splunk Cloud could be the right answer if it doesnt flop. 

On the flip side, I think splunk will have no choice but to continue Splunk Enterprise licensing for the forseeable future, because DoD and corps use it for data they have all kinds of requirements for, and couldnt just hand it off to splunk. Like, not even allowed in aws govcloud data. 

Cheers!"

2021-04-13 04:36:41,wallstreetbets,"Well, it depends on what you mean by scale. If you have hot indexes going beyond 250TB, sure, you're gonna have a bad time. If you architect it appropriately you can achieve pretty good scale for most needs....but yeah, it doesn't scale in to the PB world very well - though I'd argue there's rarely good reason for ES to be in the PB scale, at that size you need to be looking at a hybrid approach where ES is just one part of a wider architecture. At large scale, a one-tool solution never works perfectly, imo.


And in the context of this thread - try going with Splunk for PB scale on AWS and then you'll see what expensive hot garbage really looks like ;)"

2021-04-13 12:31:51,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure they could turn it around, but they'd have to reduce their prices, and I don't see that happening. IMO they are only surviving because of their existing captive customer base, and not because of real net new growth. But hey I could be wrong.

I think the attractive thing about the monolithic approach is that people hate learning multiple different tools and want 1 tool to rule them all. Kinda like how you see ridiculously obese SQL and they think the issue is 'the RDBMS doesn't scale' when really they are doing something pretty stupid. 

When I see 50PB of cold logs in Splunk I just want to ask ""why?"".....they could be offloading archival somewhere much cheaper, more portable, and more usable. But hey, people doing dumb things keeps food on our table so we can't complain eh"

I did a rough calculation and my estimate is that at the peak of this rally, $URNM will be 5x from current levels, and $URA a little less than that due to it not being a pureplay on U miners. $CCJ will probably go 5x also but I‚Äôd rather not be concentrated in just one miner, I‚Äôd rather play the whole sector which has a strong underlying fundamental story to it.

The biggest things they should be looking for is a CEO that understands and can execute Cohens vision. Someone who can spot talent and cultivate it, who can get all branches of the company to buy in to the new vision and dumps anyone who can't.

Most of the suggestions I've seen are for people who were CEOs of big companies and have big names. Fuck that shit, they might as well have kept Sherman. Whoever they pick needs to have passion to make gamestop greater than it is."

No matter what happens, you won! You saw the potential for the long play and seized the opportunity, you saw what the vast majority of others did not. There are going to be some winners out of all of this, and sadly some losers, that is unfortunately the nature of our society. 

But you, you glorious ~~goon~~ ape made it! Buy the most ridiculously annoying color lambo imaginable, put vinyl decals on it with your triumphant win, diamond hands and all with moon graphics (don't forget the cats, how could I have forgotten to mention that?). Do burn outs in front of Wallstreet or Melvin capital or whomever you personally feel you outsmarted in their overzealous greed to run a company into the ground. Then buy a pile of switch consoles, show up to a children's hospital and offer them rides in a ridiculous outfit cruisin' down the street in the lambo. Shower them with switches and games, and prove that you are the best type of person. Make it such a spectacle with a portion of your winnings that no one with a moral fiber will ever question dragging you into court. Be who everyone knows you are, a generous and kind person.

Of the places I‚Äôve lived, New England is my least favorite so far. It‚Äôs the most expensive for the least desirable area.

I‚Äôm considering moving back to the west coast, a friend of mine wants to open a bar and he wants me to help him run it, and it honestly sounds like a dream.

Also appeal process in the US is not a real appeal process by any means as testified by the numerous number of people that went in jail without having done anything just because they happen to have a different skin color."

2021-04-12 21:57:14,wallstreetbets,"This assumption has been wrong and there is little reason to think your assumption will be the right for a good few years. The credits are due to increasing efficiency requirements, which if you actually think about it, will continue to increase until car companies are probably between 90%-100% EV. So likely minimally 15 years before we see these credits go away and probably about 5 years before there is any meaningful decline in the credit revenue. In any case, if Tesla is not already profitable without the credits, I believe by the time the new factories are opened this year they should become clearly profitable (i.e. due to costs of producing and delivering the cars going down... the 4680 cells and single casts should also mean improved cars as well, so demand should continue to exceed supply for a long-time)."
2021-04-13 04:07:59,wallstreetbets,"> Aren't citadel in hot water and long on tesla?

Citadel is the biggest TSLA options market maker - they have tens of millions of TSLA shares of delta hedging inventory alone. There are over 950,000 deep in the money call contracts from last year's TSLA rally - I'd guess Citadel has written around 300,000 of those, maybe more.

I don't think Citadel has a directional bet on TSLA - nor would it be wise with such a huge TSLA inventory. I'm sure they are using their TSLA weight to pin the price around key expiry dates though.

I.e. Citadel is delta neutral and doesn't really care about whether TSLA rises or falls.

OP's short thesis is based on a fundamental & embarrassing misconceptions about Tesla's current state & business prospects, and shows clear contempt for rational, critical analysis."

Look I'm a Tesla fan and like Elon for the crazy dude he is. But I don't like the Tesla valuation. 10% people believe TSLA for auto pilot, 10% are in it for the electric cars, 10% are in it for uhh battery technology. The other 70% are following the first 30%. It's social dominoes."
2021-04-12 23:23:40,wallstreetbets,"Outproducing Tesla is irrelevant as you will need to meet overall efficiency requirements so the ICE vehicles will still come with a penalty. As efficiency requirements go up, it will require an ever-accelerating pace of conversion to EV to avoid having to buy credits. It is really a math problem. From a legislative standpoint, if you want to promote EV adoption you need to continue to increase efficiency requirements which means the credits are not going down anytime soon. You can model this on a spreadsheet easy enough, and depending on exactly what efficiency requirements are pushed the credit market can easily increase. Only companies that are full (or almost fully) electric will have extra credits to sell. VW will not have credits to sell as it would be counter-productive to allow a company that makes 25% of their vehicles EV off the hook, when the goal is to promote 100% EV adoption."

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/financials/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/financials/)

You want to compare Apple to Tesla, let's do it.  Apple had $274B in revenue last year with at 38.2% gross margin.  Tesla had $31.5B revenue last year with a 21% gross margin.

Despite Apple doing 8.7X Tesla's revenue, in an industry with much better profit margins, Tesla's market cap is about 30% of Apple's.  This is on a gross margin basis, if you look at net income, Tesla still doesn't earn a profit through operations.  They squeak out a profit due to subsidies from the US government.

This is all while having a virtual monopoly of the EV space.  Meanwhile, every major auto manufacturer in the world is now investing heavily into EV and will have a competitive product or product line available within the next 5 years.

I agree that the Tesla brand is valuable, but giving it a 20X+ price-sales ratio as an auto manufacturer is just absurd.  Toyota's price/sales ratio is less than 1.  You can maybe justify it for a small new company, but Tesla is already the most valuable auto company in the world, and it's not even close.

Where do you want the price to go next?  Where is the upside?  If Tesla doubles again it becomes a $1.3T market cap company with under $50B in annual sales.  Facebook is under $0.9T market cap with $86B annual revenue and an 80% gross margin.  You'd have to be clinically insane to think Tesla is a more valuable company than Facebook."
2021-04-13 00:52:51,wallstreetbets,"They can only have a surplus if they (can be GM, Ford, Toyota, etc... not just VW ) increase EV production faster then the required ZEV credits increase. In CA for example the ZEV % required for 2021 is 12%, whereas for 2025 it is 22%.

In any case the ZEV credit system is a penalty if you don't meet it, hence it is cheaper to buy excess credits from manufacturers with a surplus.

This really is not that complicated.

As to why governments would push this further... Well maybe some see value in accelerating the move to EV's and see the ZEV system as a great incentive, so they will want to increase the requirements, hence ZEV credits are here to stay for a while."

TSLA is still a growth company with insane year-to-year rates. No one cares for the revenue right now, because it's all going towards investments. If you can't realize what the revenue will look like once all factories are in full production and FSD becomes government-approved, 1.3T market cap is probably on the low side. Government subsidies? Come on man, the car industry and many other sectors would have been bankrupt long ago if it wasn't for taxpayer money-saving their asses.

Tesla and Amazon are two different businesses, at different times in the market, and at different maturities in their life cycle. My initial comment is solely focused on how ‚Äútheir P/E is over 1000x‚Äù is not always a useful metric for assessing the long term value of a business, given its quarter to quarter variability.

Edit is not ""indirectly CRSP"" its another company with just as much claim to crispr and crsp. That being said you should own both."
2021-04-13 05:13:59,wallstreetbets,"Of course it's mutagenic, what the fuck does gene therapy consist of? What do you call it when a gene is altered? It's mutation! The thing is you are controlling it with Cas 9. It's controlled, directed mutation. Seriously your post is kinda like saying that water is really good at washing stuff but we shouldn't use it because it's wet. Water is good at washing stuff BECAUSE it is wet. What the actual fuck."
2021-04-13 19:43:54,wallstreetbets,IV crush and Theta will burn you. I would have sold that call and rolling it into a longer dated call or shares.

2021-04-12 21:41:43,wallstreetbets,"Why will any of this boom with all the other CRISPR companies out there with their own CRISPR enzymes? Inscripta has MAD7, for free. Mammoth has a small ass Cas enzyme which is definitely better for almost all uses, and many other players out there with better products than Cas9 or Cpf1/Cas12a."
2021-04-13 10:17:52,wallstreetbets,"Relax.

There are good mutations and bad mutations. Off target mutations, uncontrolled, unintended mutations, are bad. 

I am saying that despite using a gRNA to target genomic editing, be it deletion, insertion, or replacement, studies are underestimating off target effects. The consequence is the rapid development of cancer in at least some trials, initial evidence seems to show.

You can claim we need more evidence. Great. My post simply provides evidence that maybe there is a reason to be cautious."

2021-04-12 22:07:23,wallstreetbets,"I just work in the field of cell engineering for cell therapies and am curious. I'm unaware if there's something like Mammoth's technology is based off Cas9 and therefore owes a royalty to them, or whatnot.

Besides making a therapeutic product, I do believe the novelty of these enzymes is losing it's novelness, due to so many more being found/created in labs."

I did after buying my first couple thousand listen to an earnings call, and it wasn't anything crazy, but the people believed in what they were doing, and not just trying to boost the stock price. 

I thought about their current customers, forklifts, and imagined a forklift plugged in for 30mins to charge as opposed to a hydrogen cell needing only 5 mins to fill. I bought more."

Orders backed up, and shipments to companies basically stopped. Turns out, at the same time everyone started working from home, ushering in a new wave of people on top of gamers looking to buy a gpu. A few months go by, and manufacturing starts up again with a higher demand for GPU's then before, but as they hit the shelves Bitcoin hits an All-time high. So now not only do you have the gamers looking to buy GPU's but you have the WorkForce and Bitcoin miners buying too, on an already stressed supply. The worlds manufacturing was not ready for this increase in demand, therefore the price goes up. Supply and demand, it's simple."
2021-04-13 17:00:54,wallstreetbets,"The point at which I owned 2000 shares of GME was pre-Jan 28. At the time my goal was to make a shitload of money, which I did depending on your opinion of what ""a shitload"" is. Even without the paper losses I showed for the sake of the 'we demand loss porn' crowd (-$483K from the peak), I still acquired enough profits from selling options to zero out all debts, pay for at least a year of living and business expenses, and still have enough to pay the tax man.

Many of those options at the time were exercised / assigned, as I had rolled them extremely deep into the money to secure profits.

Around $40/share I was looking at my 100 ""Fuck You"" shares I planned to take to my grave, my six-figure returns (thus far) that I'd made on GME, and the bleeding price action when I discovered a new strategy, which would leverage options for infinite shares, as long as prices are continually suppressed.

If I was wrong, I'd earn a shitload of money on the squeeze (which I did, again, when the price shot up from $45 to $350), and if I was right, I'd end up literally owning the company outright.

Now I'm in a middle area. The price bleeds, I amass shares at an exponential rate, and I get WAY more shit from WSB-ers for posting Robinhood screenshots than I do from folks who like to dig up old posts (but for some reason can't see where I've already discussed this).

So I've said it before and I'll say it again: I'm not posting anymore Robinhood screenshots. Things will be much more interesting in the weeks/months to come if you just go ahead and assume that the shares in Fidelity are all of my shares."
2021-04-13 17:07:29,wallstreetbets,"If the price stays down, and I can average 5% cumulative increase in shares weekly... about 140 weeks (a little under 3 years).

If I can average even 10% monthly, I'd break 1million shares in about 4 years.

Working to get a head start now; not expecting to keep up 10% weekly, lol (keep bringing that sweet sweet price suppression + high IV, though and maybe!). If somehow the price moved in *just* the right way that I could acquire 10% more cumulative shares on a weekly basis, I'll break 1 million shares by April 2022.

Not complicated. It's just math."

2021-04-13 12:31:28,wallstreetbets,I would say that shares are almost certainly safe at this point but I don't know when it is going up again.  Their outlook and growth are solid enough (though some think over valued) but I wouldn't risk an EOW anymore. That ship has possibly sailed.

2021-04-13 15:49:23,wallstreetbets,Not enough to justify a more than 3000% increase in stock price lol
2021-04-13 16:20:55,wallstreetbets,"I hope your puts print. 

Clearly there have been a lot of people buying at these prices, so what yu justify as a fair price and what someone else justifies it at might not be the same. 

I don't think tesla should be more than $200. But its close to $800. Numbers don't justify the price, market sentiment seems to prevail."
2021-04-13 16:59:49,wallstreetbets,Lol tesla has a high price because it has a future.  Tesla also isn‚Äôt up over 3000% from where it was last year lol.  What an idiotic comparison.
2021-04-13 17:04:34,wallstreetbets,"It's just a comparison to demonstrate fundamentals don't really mean much for every scenario. So just like you said ""tesla has a high price cuz it has a future"", the same can be said for ganestop. And yeah a year ago it didn't have the future it has now. So not buying it a year ago, but being comfortable with buying it now while it's 3000% higher can be justified. 

Im really not arguing against you btw, just playing devils advocate to your original comment."

Honestly don't get why you're so upset about this lol. 

And I won't lose, I've already realized a 700% gain on my initial $5k investment into GME. Everything else I'm holding is house money currently. My üí∞ bags are secured and in my savings. Thanks for hoping I atleast enjoy it tho? Weird.

I also bought 3 4/23 ITM puts at a 148 strike.   This way it still covers by a few hundred bucks on the remaining 25 if we end the week back at 119 or so. 

if we ride to 150 it's still pays 30k or so, after taking out 5k for put costs , and if there's an absolutely meltdown it prints."
2021-04-13 14:00:36,wallstreetbets,Rad my man. Glad to see you get a win here. Any chance we could talk sometime about strategies and philosophy?

2021-04-13 17:04:58,wallstreetbets,$20b in FCF and take a $2.8b to be done with CCP? That's a pretty good deal.

2021-04-13 03:26:27,wallstreetbets,Can you give a timeline when you talk about long term? 2 years? 5 years? 5+ years?
2021-04-13 11:37:25,wallstreetbets,"5+ years. Think about Amazon. They didn‚Äôt really take off until around 20 years after they went public. Palantir is positioning itself to be embedded in the data ecosystem of all industries. This will take time, but if it becomes a necessity for every medium to large business then it will be huge."
2021-04-13 19:57:42,wallstreetbets,I might have to pick up some options for 6-9 months out. This could be epic when it pops. üöÄ
