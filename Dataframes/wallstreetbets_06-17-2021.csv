2021-06-17 19:30:00,wallstreetbets,"6/25 $25 and $26… 6/25 $20… 7/2 $24.5

2021-06-17 19:45:22,wallstreetbets,"Look at my only other post.  +$27,000.  +200% something like that"
2021-06-17 19:50:57,wallstreetbets,Eventually I plan on it … I see this bullish run ending around $27-28 and some sideways trading there for a while. Thats when I’ll consider exercising

2021-06-17 19:51:41,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I'm recommending you buy further out exp."
2021-06-17 19:54:24,wallstreetbets,You may be right. I’m trading strictly off of my personal technical analysis. It’s broken major resistance at $25 and I expect a short term bump in price. Then some consolation. I don’t necessarily trade off Greeks.

2021-06-17 19:18:14,wallstreetbets,"So, lemme get this straight:   
a.) You read that ContextLogic is being sued for something that happened between December 2020 - March 2021.  
b.) You note that the stock fell because of this.  
c.) You conclude that the stock is going to fall because of these things that happened earlier in the year and that everyone has been aware of for over a month (how old is this lawsuit again? It's certainly been around since two weeks ago when the stock started moving back up).   


This is old news and likely priced in. You better hope some new negative press shows up or you're going to be in for a world of pain."
2021-06-17 19:10:47,wallstreetbets,Can you post a screenshot so we can have a record of this retarded move
2021-06-17 19:21:16,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck? This firm appears to sue just about everyone in a class action. I looked at their website. They don’t seem like ambulance chaser level, but definitely not too far off!

Tesla, Samsung, Amazon, Exxon, Facebook,…fucking Amtrak. yo this firm sues everybody."
2021-06-17 19:17:22,wallstreetbets,Just goes to show that these stupid ass unethical law firms should be sued. Look at this shit. This guy is buying $40k worth of puts on their bogus headlines that they know will not be successful. Unbelievable
2021-06-17 18:59:04,wallstreetbets,This is hyperbole. These law suits happen all the time. But you can sue the lawyers for misleading you about the misleading.
2021-06-17 19:03:37,wallstreetbets,Your gonna $WISH you didn’t 😂
2021-06-17 19:13:32,wallstreetbets,"Dude no. Sell those puts that is such a waste of money man. Go look at Pinterest news feed on finviz and know that it’s looked like that since the $20’s. These lawsuits are so typical, just a bunch of BS. There are very specific legal requirements for succeeding at these lawsuits... they’re just throwing what they can at the wall to see what sticks and if 1 out of 100 is successful then it’s worth it to them. Really hate to see you waste your money on puts man"
2021-06-17 19:27:48,wallstreetbets,Price is baked in also you’re testing some hard support here at 10.50. Also loss porn soon!
2021-06-17 19:49:03,wallstreetbets,I sold you those puts! 😂
2021-06-17 19:41:48,wallstreetbets,"Ummm...... That had absolutely nothing to do with the price falling.... The price fell because it was 51% shorted when there were 61 million shares and then in May lock up expired and there were now 464 million shares.... Imagine like a big dilution... So they tanked the price right before a massive dilution and then when they go to cover it's not going to put any upward pressure on especially because it's done in dark pools..

During this time. Institutional ownership increased from something like 20% to 97%.. with a nice flow to 474 million do you think All of those institutional investors 97%.. are morons.. Do some real research quit wasting people's time"
2021-06-17 19:21:51,wallstreetbets,"Broooo these law firms are str8 up asking people to come forward to represent and banking on people who got in around the IPO (like myself) to feel some type of way because the decline in share price... When you have a concrete case there's no need to ask. It's the same gimmick you see for zantac and shit on infomercials. 

I'd sue whoever told you that was smart and get the fuck out of that position."
2021-06-17 18:50:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah nice FUD DD
2021-06-17 18:55:44,wallstreetbets,Proof?

2021-06-17 19:35:56,wallstreetbets,Got any proof of the puts you claim to have bought?
2021-06-17 18:49:48,wallstreetbets,You could have just given the 40k to the first person you see on the street. Would probably have the same outcome 🤷🏻‍♂️

2021-06-17 18:42:15,wallstreetbets,That news came out on May 11. They cancelled the July trips to Canada. They were in discussion with CDC for US start. Hopefully they come up with an agreement with Canada as well. Remember at that time they didn’t have these scheduled. Uncertain when they would resume in US. There were only 3 ships set to sail in July that were not cancelled 2 from Galveston and 1 from Miami. CCl  🛳 🚀🚀🚀

I guess RCL testing positive Covid must have changed their minds. Honestly though, 2 ppl in RCL out of who knows how many is inconsequential in my opinion. The other 8 on a different cruise were all crew members. If you read the link, CCL has all of their members vaccinated as well! CCL 🛳🚀🚀🚀! Can’t wait til tomorrow! Already up .28 after hours!!!"

2021-06-17 18:46:14,wallstreetbets,If only my audio won't cut out on my 6700xt....  It seems to be a lingering bug.
2021-06-17 18:06:52,wallstreetbets,"Indeed. AMD rocks in digital entertainment.

The PS5, the Xbox X/S, the GPU market (6000 series GPUs), the APU market (5700G/5600G), the consumer CPU market, the handheld market (e.g. Aya Neo or even the new Valve console launching with AMD), the laptop market (Razer launched their new AMD 5900HX laptops), or the ASUS G15 advantage (with AMD CPU/GPU & Smartshift+SAM).... even the DATACENTER market.

Even Elon wants AMD APUs and GPUs in Teslas to game while on autonomous driving.

And Samsung is bringing it to the S22.... with Ray-tracing.

I mean, it is a no-brainer.

Google, Microsoft, Sony, Samsung, Tesla, Razer, Lenovo, HP, Dell, ACER, ASUS, Valve, etc.

**Everyone that wants gaming entertainment is on AMD.**"
2021-06-17 18:53:02,wallstreetbets,"I also hold NVIDIA. Buy their P/E is going into ludicrous territory (+88 ?!!??!).

Also, I don't think the ARM deal will go through. Google, Microsoft and other giants don't want it."
2021-06-17 17:57:58,wallstreetbets,"For sure!... I think we can see $105 after their Q2 report next month.

By the end of the year, I expect $130."
2021-06-17 19:18:13,wallstreetbets,"Looks deep into space. Turns to captain Lisa Su, with an elegant hand floating over the jump speed button:

""Hit it, babe."""
2021-06-17 19:42:13,wallstreetbets,"AMD also at $97 last December. Plus intel is going to hybrid x86 architecture by the end of the year with alder lake. Being that AMD ""7nm"" is close to the same physical size as Intel ""14nm"" I would imagine intel finally going to 10mn is going to soak up a lot of AMD's recent momentum in the mainstream and enthusiast CPU market. On top of that TSMC (who supplies all of AMD's silicon) has a lot of automotive and electronic equipment silicon demand to catch up with by buyers that have deeper pockets than the enthusiast market where AMD is gaining ground. Most of the hype around AMD's recent performance advancements are centered around ""fanboyism"" for the brand and wanting to see an underdog topple intel and nvidia. I see an upside to AMD taking over market share over competitors in the server/datacenter arena if they can fix their DOA product rates and burnout rates vs. the competition but they're still competing against companies with bigger R&D budgets and bigger market share.

edit because I forgot to mention TSMC is the supplier of AMD's silicon."
2021-06-17 19:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Visit [tipranks.com](https://tipranks.com). Most analysts expect AMD in the $105 to $115 range.

The upside is still there and strong, given the companies involved in launching the upcoming AMD products (e.g. Valve, Tesla, Asus, etc.)."
2021-06-17 18:18:45,wallstreetbets,"I had an issue with an Admin there that didn't want to post my articles.

Some clown making up censorship rules that kept me from posting anything.

Got sick of the guy. Feel free to let the admins at r/amd_stock know.

Perhaps they give him a well deserved warning and start treating me fairly."

I get it... since you can't argue with the content, you NEED take the discussion elsewhere.

2021-06-17 18:53:53,wallstreetbets,The card just came out. It is likely a software glitch. Report it on the AMD Radeon tool.
2021-06-17 19:17:05,wallstreetbets,AMD is only 34 right now. NVDA is either too pricey or AMD is dirt cheap. I think it’s the latter. There is such a huge demand for their products and the advancements both are bringing has been absolutely amazing.
2021-06-17 19:51:11,wallstreetbets,"No, AMD's 7nm (TSMC) is similar to Intel 10nm. Plus, Apple is leaving TSMC's 5nm ready for AMD next year. You think Apple (of all companies) has a crappy process node???...

Also, you seem to ignore the architecture (e.g. 3D cache stacking, infinity fabric, SAM, smartshift)... as well as software solutions (e.g. FX SR). You put that together and AMD is wiping the floor with Intel. They fired 2 CEO's in the last 5 years for a reason. I'm pretty sure it wasn't due to ""AMD fanboyism"".

Honestly, you think Ryzen and Epyc are about fanboyism???...

The PS5 and Xbox are about fanboyism???....

Epyc provides 50% lower TCO to the datacenter. You think ""El Capitan"" of the Dept. of Energy is about ""fanboyism"" ???

Having a secure network ensures the pipeline security disaster doesn't repeat.

Also, APUs are NOT fanboyism... they are efficient and convenient.

Being efficient, with more cores, higher IPC and less heat is NOT fanboyism.

You can call it GEEKISM or NERDISM... but not fanboyism.

So yeah, I suggest you try bringing some of the actual products to your arguments... and see if they still hold water."
2021-06-17 18:22:42,wallstreetbets,What was the post in question... Mods there are pretty pretty coooool if you ask me ;)
2021-06-17 19:35:10,wallstreetbets,"I agree, mostly considering the 50% revenue growth AMD is expecting this year, a 35.5 P/E is cheap. In essence, if you can make that 50% go to the bottom line (if not more), the multiple will drop next year.

However, Nvidia has a few items that don't make me as confident on an >88 P/E.

\#1- The ARM deal is priced in but will likely get rejected (top dogs don't want it).

\#2- The upcoming launches from AMD (mostly the APUs) will hurt Nvidia.

\#3- AMD has MCM coming (RDNA3) with the potential to leave Nvidia in the dust.

\#4- As intel joins the GPU world... Nvidia will be the only player without CPU's (provided #1 doesn't occur).

So for those reasons, a P/E of >88 seems unjustified.

On the flip-side, AMD is reasonable at 45 to 55 P/E."
2021-06-17 19:36:45,wallstreetbets,"in my opinion i think AMD is dirt cheap. I got out of AMD at 90, only because the market has been sleeping on it and i wanted to take my profits elsewhere. It is easily worth 120 a pop imo."
2021-06-17 18:40:50,wallstreetbets,Yeah some mods work real well to make sure the peanuts don't get out of hand 😉😆

I actually wrote him back to ask why he was still censoring me. He basically wrote that my post was trash, so he wouldn't publish it.

He's high on ""authority"" ala Eric Cartman. Probably struggling with puberty."
2021-06-17 19:38:21,wallstreetbets,"i dont think anyone will worry about intel in my honest opinion. time and time again they have been a let down. Which is why people have been turning to AMD. I think it was a few quarters ago where intel said they couldnt make their chips small enough for their 7th gen and AMD came back a day later basically saying ""oh, we can"" and they rocketed up 3-4%"

2021-06-17 17:01:34,wallstreetbets,"> I’ll be honest this is my first SWOT outside of a **class that I didn’t do particularly well in**

I’m in.

Edit: In all seriousness, ASO is a great buy and I agree that it is seriously undervalued. With that said, I think the potential for additional KKR offerings is creating some drag on the stock price. Just to be clear, KKR unloading shares isn’t a red flag but is instead a natural progression of their investment strategy (they are simply reaping the fruits of their labor).

Institutions hold 90% of the outstanding shares and these same institutions can, and have, taken advantage of KKR’s previous offerings. The most recent offering was in early May @ $32 (following an April block sale at $28 and a January offering @ $21.50). If KKR was going to do an additional offering, now might be a good time to do it.

That ultimately brings me to my retarded, definitely don’t listen to me, put on your tin foil hat, conclusion which is: Smart money is not going to buy up shares on the open market at $42-$45 if they think KKR will offer shares at $38-$40. Not saying KKR is offering at $38-$40, just that there could be an expectation that an offering is possible so folks may be waiting to make sure they don’t over pay."

I found a video on youtube -( dated June 11! ) where guys predicted pullback in ASO this week. Notice that this pullback is 1)supposed to go to about $37 (based on their graph) -this has happened today and 2)such pullbacks are usually followed by a strong rebound.

This is a solid safe stock that will make you money. I would just go long on shares. This is safer and more impactful on the stock price than buying calls. Don't get greedy. With shares ""holding costs you nothing"" and the stock has only upward potential."

2021-06-17 18:33:20,wallstreetbets,Historically the way they have structured their offerings has made the stock absolutely rip and IV go through the roof. Contrary to what logic would indicate.

2021-06-17 18:50:29,wallstreetbets,"You’re right, the last 3 offerings have made the stock rip and that’s kind of my point. The possibility of an offering creates this odd price uncertainty where people are buying and selling the stock at a given price but there is the possibility of a big offering of shares looming over it all. But once the offering price is announced, the market kind of resets around that price and the uncertainty is resolved. The share price is then free to move again until the possibility of another offering becomes more likely."

2021-06-17 16:45:52,wallstreetbets,"Considering he paid ~$300k for those options to start with, this whole thing is dumb"
2021-06-17 16:45:11,wallstreetbets,No I’m at about 295k for the day this was my AMD position I trade quite a bit. Traders jumped on 82$ calls at 0.24 cents yesterday/today that expire tomorrow so you’ll see a sell off in a bit . But I expect amd to get up to 90$ by July 31

2021-06-17 16:51:22,wallstreetbets,Well if I double 300k before July I would like to think it was well worth it. Not a 1000% return but it’s money I’ll take. No one turns down money
2021-06-17 17:12:26,wallstreetbets,I believe amd will be over 90$ by summer these options should be worth about 500k

2021-06-17 19:12:50,wallstreetbets,Hence why they went from owning thousands of shares of GME to owning none in January. They exist to make money.

2021-06-17 18:37:03,wallstreetbets,"Before the pandemic started, AMC was trading at around $6. That it's managing to sustain a price 10x a point in time where they had all of their theaters open, and there was a normal flow of movies, is a reasonable thing to be surprised at I think.

&#x200B;

It's hard to imagine they have really become 10x more valuable. If all else were normal, people would be speculating how strongly movie theaters would be bouncing back over the next couple months. That many movie studios got through the pandemic by skipping theaters and going straight to streaming has to be making investors nervous.

&#x200B;

At some point I'd expect for people to just stop shorting the stock, and then a chain-reaction of people finally taking profits. Which would, presumably, tank the value.

&#x200B;

It can't be an endless ride, that's not the point of this sub. People are not here so that they can take over AMC and get free popcorn. Everyone wants to get rich.

&#x200B;

<shrug>

&#x200B;

Not saying people should bail now. But it's not crazy for people to be surprised that the ride is still going."
2021-06-17 18:30:17,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely no one is investing in AMC based on what AMC does as a business. It's a FOMO & hype stock. It's like investing in coins, it's all a fugazzi"

2021-06-17 18:33:28,wallstreetbets,"🤦‍♂️😂 That’s exactly what was said about GME, just before it shot up to $483 a share January 28th. Nobody is on this stock because of its “fundamentals”, that’s completely irrelevant right now. GME was, and still is, a shit company. Didn’t stop “ape nation” from running that up.

2021-06-17 19:07:01,wallstreetbets,"Well if we both agree why have we got to this point lol? Good luck on your tendies, I was only pointing out how surprised I was GME/AMC had managed to keep the crazyness going after so many months, that's all"
2021-06-17 19:26:11,wallstreetbets,"I got ya. I’m not terribly surprised by AMC, as I feel it still has plenty of room to run. I’m completely surprised, however, that GME is still where it is, AND PEOPLE ARE STILL BUYING IT! They say it hasn’t squeezed yet. 🤦‍♂️ Reaching almost $500 a share, for GME of all businesses, it most definitely has squeezed. No more room for it to go. Good luck to you, as well. May we both meet down the road in tendie land."

2021-06-17 16:46:04,wallstreetbets,"*Why the metal market tanked today:*

China's National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration announced Wednesday that it will ""release metal in batches in near future."" Copper and aluminum held in government strategic stockpiles were specifically named as targets of the action, and also zinc, which is used for galvanizing steel.    
  
It's hard to overstate the significance of this event, which is almost unprecedented in recent memory. Citing analysts, Reuters says this sale of stockpiled metals will be ""the first such move in a decade"" by China.

Reuters is reporting that China's move has base metals prices trading ""sharply lower."" That's obviously bad for U.S. metals producers like US Steel and Century Aluminum, because it means greater competition on price from China. It's also not particularly great news for a company like Star Bulk.  
  
Consider: If China starts using more of the metal that it has stockpiled in production, well ... that metal is already there in China. It doesn't need to be imported -- and neither do the dry bulk raw materials used to make even more metal. This will presumably mean less demand for Star Bulk's services, for so long as the metals-dump on the market continues."
2021-06-17 16:42:59,wallstreetbets,No problem apes. Just the total lack of interest in the stock surprised me so I had to share with y’all 🚀👍🏼
2021-06-17 16:53:54,wallstreetbets,"Notice how your article neglects to mention if China has steel stockpiles. Because they don't.

Also steel futures were up today.

I hold $CLF shares and calls at various strikes, as well as $MT call options. No $STLD for me."
2021-06-17 16:53:07,wallstreetbets,Many of the large structural steel companies in the US will not use import steel unless they absolutely have to
2021-06-17 18:00:03,wallstreetbets,"> If China starts using more of the metal that it has stockpiled in production, well ... that metal is already there in China. It doesn't need to be imported -- and neither do the dry bulk raw materials used to make even more metal. This will presumably mean less demand for Star Bulk's services, for so long as the metals-dump on the market continues.

What many forget to consider is that shipping expenses skyrocketed and are not coming down significantly anytime soon. Many ships have been sidelined during the pandemic and were scrapped for metals as metal prices rose. Now those ships are deerly missed. Try getting a container from China to the US in the next couple of months. Not easy at all.

The import of significant amounts of steel from China is not economically viable in the near future."

2021-06-17 18:44:49,wallstreetbets,I sat on PLTR for months hoping for some upward trend. Instead it traded sideways.

2021-06-17 16:32:29,wallstreetbets,Hope you averaged down during the past few months. More tendies!

2021-06-17 18:50:27,wallstreetbets,What do y’all think NVDA can reach Market Cap wise? Are we looking at 1T?
2021-06-17 16:24:08,wallstreetbets,positions
2021-06-17 17:17:37,wallstreetbets,nice. i panic sold in 2018 when it dipped hard. bought back in last month during the dip and have a 20% return so far.  When the stock splits 1 to 4 next month i think we will see a big pump.
2021-06-17 17:22:20,wallstreetbets,I got a 610 call 2 weeks back and now it’s a 10 bagger
2021-06-17 16:36:27,wallstreetbets,ive never understood options

2021-06-17 16:20:03,wallstreetbets,"Gratz, but how much did you risk? To see the ROI. Good plays."
2021-06-17 16:36:41,wallstreetbets,Wait. How did you get a daily view of realized gains/losses on fidelity?
2021-06-17 18:44:08,wallstreetbets,Still learning options. Can someone explain why the 70 and 75 calls for AMC are profitable when they haven't hit that amount?
2021-06-17 16:34:45,wallstreetbets,This is the wayyyy!!!!🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-17 16:22:27,wallstreetbets,AMC 🥲
2021-06-17 16:48:19,wallstreetbets,Do you do your taxes quarterly? Use an accountant or do it yourself?
2021-06-17 17:04:59,wallstreetbets,I $wish you make this every month🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-17 16:18:39,wallstreetbets,What were your plays?
2021-06-17 19:37:08,wallstreetbets,Expected AMC position - expectation achieved.
2021-06-17 19:38:54,wallstreetbets,When did you enter these positions?
2021-06-17 19:47:52,wallstreetbets,was looking at TQQQ too. my stupid brokerage (vanguard) didnt let me buy options on leveraged products. LAME. TAKE THESE GODDAM TRAInING WHEELS OFF
2021-06-17 17:13:04,wallstreetbets,Exactly why I am asking some of the questions I am. However hope you made it all back 1000 times.
2021-06-17 19:16:28,wallstreetbets,"I say…been there! And it is brutal. The sleepless nights - the nausea. I’ve done my time on that end of trades for sure. I’d love to say I never will again but the longer you trade, the more humbled you become. I’m currently trying to avoid the house of pain by exiting my options (or other high risk trades) quicker and manage my risk by entering with a smaller portion of my account. 

I hope you’ve earned your way back from your losses or that you’re well in your way!"
2021-06-17 19:04:04,wallstreetbets,I hope you work at MCD so it’s a low salary year
2021-06-17 19:30:50,wallstreetbets,Imagine your gainz if you keep doubling your money with yolos
2021-06-17 19:10:34,wallstreetbets,"Yessssss. And if you’re a high risk trader, sometimes you feel poor for a while, rich for a while, then poor for a while again. Haha."
2021-06-17 16:41:44,wallstreetbets,"Go to the desktop site (you can login to the desktop site on your mobile device if you go through your browser instead of the app)

Go to the “Positions” tab

Select “Closed Positions”

That will show you!

For this particular view I selected “Group by Positions” and “View as Graph” then entered the time frames you see."
2021-06-17 19:40:09,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely! To understand this really well, read up on “the Greeks”. You can Google it, check out investopedia or watch some YouTube videos. 

But the short answer is, this stock is highly volatile right now and it still has time to make it to that price. The higher the price of AMC went today, the higher that likelihood became. So even though we aren’t to that price, someone was willing to pay a higher premium than I did for the chance that it might be tomorrow. 

Conversely, a stock can go beyond the strike price and lose value. That’s because you have to think about the premium along with the strike price. 

So an example for the scenario of gains on out of the money calls:

Say I paid $1 per share for calls on XYZ while it was at $54 per share. Share price + premium = $71. That’s the number to keep in mind. You want it to be likely that that stock could reach the strike plus call premium by expiration. So say it rapidly (within minutes) shoots up from $54 to $59…someone else may be willing to pay $2 for that same contract. It still didn’t reach $70 but the probability that it could has increased. But note that this is not always the case (see Greeks). If the stock moves slowly, hits hard resistance, if you hold the calls overnight, all those and many other things factor into the price. 

Okay now for a scenario of losses for in the money calls:

Say I paid $10 per share for XYZ calls with a $70 strike…the share cost + premium = $80. Say I purchased this when the price of XYZ was $75 so it seemed likely it would make it to $80 (strike + premium) but then the price decreased from $75 down to $72 rapidly. Momentum is fading, time is ticking away, perhaps I even hold the contract overnight…all this eats away at the likelihood it will gain enough to reach the strike plus premium I paid. So now someone may only be willing to pay $4 for a contract I paid $10 for. Meaning I could lose money even though the contract was in the money. 

I know that’s a lot, but I hope it helps!"
2021-06-17 19:27:18,wallstreetbets,Ape buy call at x amount. Stock price starts to go up and more apes think maybe it will hit that price or more. Price of call increases because closer to strike price and more interest. Original ape can sell his call for profit to other apes. Either option hits strike price and can be exercised or option expires worthless
2021-06-17 16:36:09,wallstreetbets,"Oh yes, I should have mentioned that AMC and TQQQ were the calls I traded. But don’t worry apes - I am still holding shares with diamond hands. Can’t do that with weekly calls tho."
2021-06-17 16:55:14,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I do pay quarterly estimated taxes. And I do it myself. I use TurboTax and Quickbooks. If you enter all your info, Quickbooks tells you how much to pay for your quarterly payment throughout the year. Then just export all your info into TurboTax and file. Easy peasy!"
2021-06-17 19:09:57,wallstreetbets,Same to you my friend!
2021-06-17 16:19:32,wallstreetbets,Looks like TQQQ and AMC
2021-06-17 19:41:12,wallstreetbets,"For the options I closed today, I entered them all yesterday. I was honestly incredibly nervous to hold them overnight but lucked out on a high momentum day!"
2021-06-17 17:32:08,wallstreetbets,I’ve been a Fidelity customer for 10+ years and I’ve never known of this feature.
2021-06-17 16:49:58,wallstreetbets,what app is this? TD or RH ??
2021-06-17 19:55:16,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, that was really helpful. Will definitely study up on the Greeks."
2021-06-17 19:53:25,wallstreetbets,Yes we see the tqqq fds. Godspeed retard.
2021-06-17 17:04:34,wallstreetbets,Full name of TQQQ please?
2021-06-17 17:05:50,wallstreetbets,"Sweet. 

I know this is a bit personal but its a tax question. Do you separate a % once something is sold into a side account to pay the taxes with?  So just for arguments sake.

You make a sale and get 1000$. You then think ok last quarter I paid 25% tax so you take 25% of the 1000 out and leave the rest ? or do you re bank the 1000 pay taxes and then move it back?

&#x200B;

If you dont mind."
2021-06-17 16:20:01,wallstreetbets,"Ah I’m a retard, I see the calls"
2021-06-17 19:50:16,wallstreetbets,How did you decide to make that play and what % of your portfolio did you risk?
2021-06-17 19:09:37,wallstreetbets,"It’s a game changer, right? I hope you like what you find ☺️"
2021-06-17 16:53:20,wallstreetbets,This is Fidelity
2021-06-17 18:11:57,wallstreetbets,"It’s an ETF, 3x Nasdaq-100"
2021-06-17 19:08:47,wallstreetbets,"I don’t mind a bit! I have been trading a lonnnnnnng time so I have now been blessed with a large account. When I am entering high risk trades like weekly options, I only use 10-15% of my account at any given time, which means 85-90% of my account is either dry powder or in what I consider lower risk (a stock such as NCLH) or a triple leveraged etf (such as TQQQ). When it’s time to pay quarterly taxes, I either scoop out some of my dry powder or sell one of my stocks to make the payment. 

I just want to say, if you’re relatively new to trading - you are so smart to be thinking about things like this! Sounds like you’re getting your ducks in a row."
2021-06-17 17:26:30,wallstreetbets,"If I had to pay quarterly taxes again, i would probably keep a chunk of cash in stable coins, seeing some places offering as high as 4-8% APR on them."
2021-06-17 16:36:42,wallstreetbets,"No that’s on me, I should have listed that!"
2021-06-17 18:13:47,wallstreetbets,Not a bad idea. Thanks
2021-06-17 16:26:55,wallstreetbets,"hmm good price action today and consolidated nicely heading to eod. looks like this is the guy that called itub action too

gonna toss some funny money at this tomorrow"
2021-06-17 16:20:02,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the DD was also looking at ZNGA. Share price is low and looks like a solid stock but like you said its been at the same price more or less for a long time.
2021-06-17 16:17:49,wallstreetbets,I’ve been going in and out of Zynga for what feels like forever. People have been calling for an acquisition for years.
2021-06-17 16:32:32,wallstreetbets,"I've been watching stocks that took the hit in Feb when growth equities pulled back. 

This one looks perfect for a setup to go up as there seems to be rotation back into growth.

The options are cheap here, so I'll be playing."
2021-06-17 16:31:29,wallstreetbets,Didn't Cramer say something about GME possibly buying out ZNGA?
2021-06-17 16:50:13,wallstreetbets,What timeframe are we looking at here?
2021-06-17 16:44:58,wallstreetbets,What’s your PT? IV is still pretty low.
2021-06-17 16:53:27,wallstreetbets,"Crazy. I had bought some of the June calls at 11 strike at .04 today and sold. Straight up should’ve put my whole account in. Probably going to re-enter based off those massive purchases, hope you’re right.."
2021-06-17 16:38:47,wallstreetbets,ZYNGA IS THE NEW WAVE GET ON IT BEFORE ITS TOO LATE 🌊🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-17 16:38:44,wallstreetbets,"this is the guy that caught ITUB breakout yesterday!!!!
Wow, genius!!!"
2021-06-17 16:43:48,wallstreetbets,"Mhmm I saw the volume today & decided to pick up some dirt cheap July $12c lottos. 
Guess zynga to le moon?"
2021-06-17 16:57:49,wallstreetbets,I saw the options flow this morning and jumped on and was up 500% in under an hour. LFG
2021-06-17 16:39:37,wallstreetbets,You forgot Zynga Poker!!!!🙌🏻💎 been in this stock for a long time
2021-06-17 18:35:52,wallstreetbets,Zynga just has tons of shitty games. If they would focus on quality over quantity they could get a lot more users.
2021-06-17 16:22:18,wallstreetbets,Look at price action and volume  today.... I think something is happening.  Also large option prints.
2021-06-17 16:20:02,wallstreetbets,Have you seen big prints on the stocks like this week?
2021-06-17 16:33:01,wallstreetbets,That would be nuts.....
2021-06-17 17:39:17,wallstreetbets,"Kind of like EA buying our Glu.... I'd be ecstatic.

But, honestly, I doubt we even need that as a catalyst. The big buys indicate some insider knowledge, and mobile gaming in China is booming anyways.

I still feel good about getting a good return on cheap calls."
2021-06-17 18:29:17,wallstreetbets,July is cheap as fuck.
2021-06-17 16:47:56,wallstreetbets,Ya I used a screener to find cheaper options with low IVs and $ZNGA was one. I got some July$12 for around $0.10 each lmao. Worst case scenario you lose some pocket change I guess.
2021-06-17 16:49:40,wallstreetbets,Ya those July $7 Tub calls OP shilled went full send lol
2021-06-17 18:41:52,wallstreetbets,Agree. I think the echtra acquisition shows they want a serious game.  I mean torchlight and Diablo devs.....I’m exicred
2021-06-17 18:27:06,wallstreetbets,What’s your high end target on this future high flyer?
2021-06-17 19:53:03,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit yea, I’ll pick up some contracts in the AM"
2021-06-17 16:49:28,wallstreetbets,Lots of stocks with low IV tho
2021-06-17 18:28:10,wallstreetbets,"Yammy boy, how balls deep are you in those calls?"
2021-06-17 19:26:37,wallstreetbets,"I have at the money calls and am looking for enough movement to double or triple my money. I wouldn't get too greedy here, but would not be surprised at all if we see a good pop on the next month.... Maybe up to a few dollars. But, when talking how cheap these calls are, two dollars of movement could be huge for options prices."
2021-06-17 16:50:35,wallstreetbets,But at least this one has some memeable potential no? Average analyst PT is around $13.50 I reckon...
2021-06-17 16:35:44,wallstreetbets,We doing mattresses again?

2021-06-17 18:54:33,wallstreetbets,"I followed you yesterday and I’ve enjoyed the ride so far. So far, you are the Aladdin of mattresses."
2021-06-17 16:53:32,wallstreetbets,You've got it.
2021-06-17 17:41:33,wallstreetbets,You're ded to me.
2021-06-17 18:55:49,wallstreetbets,I happen to own one of those mattresses and I can assure you that it is not that great. Claims to be cooking but it just traps hear and people I know who own Purple mattresses assure me that Purple actually doesn't trap heat like other foam mattresses. Just bought a couple $30c for July 16th today and looking to buy a Purple mattress with my profits. Trading way under the target prices for me to not invest in such a great company
2021-06-17 17:47:51,wallstreetbets,Plenty of market share..competition is good

2021-06-17 17:27:04,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't it be fair to assume the biggest increase in inflation has already occurred thus the asset shouldn't appreciate that much?
2021-06-17 19:10:27,wallstreetbets,stop it with your common sense. the transitory inflation is an illusion.

2021-06-17 19:02:21,wallstreetbets,Wish call option volume WOW. max pain might be pinning this at 11 below VWAP but even if those calls are short it just means when it does start to squeeze the shorts gamma squeeze will happen simultaneous too with people covering and getting assigned

However, we are all adults, and this isn’t coop mode. This is PVP. 

So go ahead and yolo into these memes. I wish you the best. I want to be wrong and everyone here cheers and screams for joy. I really do. I hope you all are successful, but the logical mind says you won’t with these non-AMC and non-GME meme stocks."

2021-06-17 18:32:20,wallstreetbets,"Please help me understand:

Why is it that so few people here understand how MMs hedge options?

Options exist literally for hedging purposes.

I keep reading things like ""oh man, so many options expire tomorrow ITM, there's going to be a massive gamma squeeze!"" As if people are thinking that a gamma squeeze happens AFTER an option expires.

Why would anyone be stupid enough to think that an MM or institution would hold NAKED CALLS ITM one fucking DAY before expiry? Why? Why would anyone think this?

MMs hedge conservatively. They will buy shares as the option comes to expiry based on how close it is to the strike price. They don't keep the fucking thing naked until 3:59 and start panicking. 

Yes, I know that YOU will hold on to a bleeding option until 3:59 hoping for it to miraculously turn green, but that's now the way MMs work. They aren't gambling, they write options to hedge and they will hedge against those options as needed in order to ALWAYS be profitable. That's why they are worth billions.

This idea that every call out there is naked is fucking bananas. Many of these contracts were written a long time ago, why the fuck do you think they would not have bough shares before, when it became evident that it was going to expire ITM?"

* Praying for oil to go back up.

* Crying tears of joy as DKNG goes over 50 (or crying tears of frustration as DKNG never overcomes the massive sell walls that pop up whenever it starts to get close to 50).

* Trying to ignore the pain of seeing my mid-long term plays so red while I  monitor my higher risk short term plays.

2021-06-17 16:05:49,wallstreetbets,"**You know what the WSB Rites of Passage are? I think I've been able to chalk up pretty much every tier:**

**Bronze Level**

- Asking what basic things are instead of Googling them yourself, e.g. ""If I buy a call, does that mean it goes up?""

- Winning your first trade, suddenly getting euphoric that you're the next Michael Burry and bragging to all your friends

- ""Where do I check stock futures?""

**Silver Level**

- Making anywhere from 10 to 25% on your portfolio, all of your family members suddenly think you're a genius, and you excitedly tell all your friends about the ""strategies"" you learned

- Playing at least one meme stock at least once from Daily Threads, and winning on it out of pure luck but telling people you ""Did your DD"" meaning you got your DD from a guy in WSB comments

- Shove fingers up your asshole & sniff your own farts from being so euphoric about your geniusness after trading for 1 to 3 months

- Browse WSB on the daily, trading has become your new hobby, and Dad tells you ""Hey, you're pretty good..you could make a career out of this!""

- Friends tell you you're gambling, you tell them ""It's MORE than just gambling, it's--"" as you go on a pseduo-understanding rant of the markets who learned all his terminology from WSB

**Gold Level**

- Losing anywhere up to 99% of your portfolio, usually getting wiped out by a SINGLE red day after 2 months or more of straight green days

- Made tons of money on ridiculously OTM calls, *""B-But stocks only go up!""* --> it only works until it doesn't, everyone is a genius in a bull market, all gains lost in one day of red

- Getting burned on Boeing, AAL, UAL, or any travel stock at least once

- Depression gang hits hard, always bargaining ""I KNEW I should have sold"" or ""WHY DIDN'T I BUY THIS INSTEAD""

- Use of WSB starts to decline as you dip down into a state of depression and acceptance that you've reached Stage 3, and you were a degenerate gambler all along

- ""Why is my brokerage calling me?"""
2021-06-17 16:05:40,wallstreetbets,"**You get into the taxi, excited**. It's finally time for a weekend off. You deserve it. It's time to go to Las Vegas.

**Browsing your mobile device, a few minutes pass by.** Breaking the silence, the taxi driver pipes up. 

**""You know, man, there's a roulette table at the casino you're going to with some weird properties lately. For some reason, the ball consistently lands on black. If you bet on black, you could win a ton of cash.""**

**""I'll keep that in mind,""** you tell the taxi driver, as you step out. You take in everything around you -- Vegas, it's beautiful. You walk towards the casino, stopping by the front door, as a security guard halts your path.

**""Excuse me, sir -- oh, don't worry. I'm not here to arrest you or anything. It's just that, well, I'll give you a bit of advice -- there's this weird table here lately, and all it does is land on black. Bet on black, and you'll be rich.""**

**""I see,""** you say. Continuing inside, you see the table in front of you.

**You sit down at the roulette table**. A silver-haired gentleman with glasses is the dealer. He leans in, smiling. 

**""You're in luck, buddy. I've temporarily rigged this game to always land on black. Just put your money on black and you'll be rich""**. You notice his nametag reads Jerome.

You nod, eager to place your bet. **""Red!""** you shout.  **""It's going to land on red!""**

Jerome gives you a puzzled look. He spins the wheel, and sure enough... **""Black,""** he says, with a sigh.

**""Fuck this game, it's rigged!""** you shout, as your SPY puts expire worthless."

The market is still nervous to move from yesterday's news. The market was red except for tech. Nasdaq stayed green all day and tech went up. Bought one $495 call on NFLX, expires next week and it went up. If NFLX stays green/goes up even more tomorrow, I'll sell the call and collect my profit before NFLX goes back down to $490 range. I also bought two $168.50 calls on TTWO and they expire on July 23. Plenty of time for TTWO to climb back up to $175/$180 range. Hopefully, there won't be any more big scares soon that will cause the market to go down. The bulls are here to stay"

Don't pick multiple things... SINGLE THING... and the minute you wake up do it. If you have a bad day and don't do shit, commit to doing something in that single thing you picked before you sleep (single pushup, strum the guitar 5 mins). It's called ""no zero days"". The traction you will eventually get will motivate you to do more in life.

2021-06-17 19:06:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, gotta be willing to be honest with your therapist. I tried three separate times before I got to a place with the right person that it began to help, but part of that was likely a last-ditch survival instinct, I was spiraling hard. The thing is with depression, you’re probably not a huge piece of white, you just think you are a huge irredeemable piece of shit. You have to find a way to turn your attention away from yourself. That’s what all of the psychedelic solutions offer, is a way to shift your perspective and make it more holistic. They also change the way your brain is wired. I do believe in that, but in order to make long-term sustained gains you have to go beyond the bandaid. I’m happy to talk more about it if you’d like. I’m battling that shot everyday, and I’m happy to help anyone else that I can who is in the same position. That being said, I’m a degenerate gambler and a drunk, so if you’re looking for a full 180, go elsewhere."

That doesn’t mean I’ll do it or be convinced to do it. Maybe I just didn’t have good ones I’m not sure. It’s probably my fault cause I kept stuff from them

2021-06-17 19:31:59,wallstreetbets,Damn yeah it’s so hard. You don’t even want to stop. It’s comforting sometimes to keep doing it even if you hate it
2021-06-17 19:34:55,wallstreetbets,My problem is I enjoy being drunk even though I know I can't handle it and it fucks up my life.

2021-06-17 16:26:35,wallstreetbets,Its  going to happen for them already in.
2021-06-17 19:06:44,wallstreetbets,TL skimmed. Seems like a pretty long play. Pass.
2021-06-17 17:45:09,wallstreetbets,AI you say?  Shut up and take my 401k.

2021-06-17 16:33:02,wallstreetbets,Congrats! Go fk yourself!

2021-06-17 17:43:26,wallstreetbets,I am balls deep in 6/18 calls 🤝😻
2021-06-17 16:23:20,wallstreetbets,I like it! Fingers crossed!!
2021-06-17 16:36:08,wallstreetbets,Got in months ago low 7s sold @8.5 back in a couple weeks ago @9. 12 will be nice. I need it to move so I can get liquid again and reclaim some GME before the ATMO finishes and it explodes on the news of raising a billion in capital.
2021-06-17 16:54:28,wallstreetbets,"For anyone that stocked up before 6/9, dividend payout will be coming next month... This company pays \~4%, ain't nothing wrong with that..."
2021-06-17 16:43:47,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it, I'm in.  Buying shares calls"
2021-06-17 17:20:52,wallstreetbets,"I’m still holding 69x 6/18 $8c These things have traded flat premium like there was no time value for weeks so it’s been easier to hold than usual. Them being up 175% helps too.

Theres a good enough chance of a pop tomorrow that I’m willing to roll holding these up until the line.

I’m holding another 8690 shares."
2021-06-17 16:27:53,wallstreetbets,"Yep, this is my play for tomorrow. Just buying more shares of UWMC. Enough volume should push us over $10, and cause the snowball effect. I’ve been slowly buying, but will do my final (at least for this month) money dump tomorrow.

Edit: because this is my most upvoted comment ever, I just want to say that if you are struggling with a gambling addiction… consider YOLOing your paycheck into UWMC tomorrow!

Edit 2: /u/astrik123 had a tantalizing thought about tomorrow’s market, which I’ll transcribe here: “[H]ere’s what I like to fantasize about, Mat Daddy [Ishibia] is on a half oz coke bender right now waiting for quad witching, dude is literally sweating and chewing on his coke jaw waiting to blow 100m in buy back at market open causing a massive squeeze to $40 in turn setting a new price floor at ~22ish then he will crash out for 48 hours and wake up being worth 12 billion more than he was on Friday.” This is just silly ape talk, of course, but it’s a fun thing to dream of."
2021-06-17 16:22:09,wallstreetbets,Gonna buy UWMC tomorrow and see if it prints
2021-06-17 17:18:03,wallstreetbets,"Channeling up. Break that $11 mark and fly

2021-06-17 17:32:58,wallstreetbets,Let’s hope you’re right.. looking at -98% on my $11 calls for tomorrow
2021-06-17 16:13:58,wallstreetbets,"Not sure about the squeeze, but I like UWMC!!  High quality, deep value"
2021-06-17 17:37:12,wallstreetbets,Almost at 10 after hours today. Money machine is starting to go brrrr
2021-06-17 17:44:25,wallstreetbets,"I have 200 $9 calls for tomorrow, maybe I’ll exercise them"
2021-06-17 16:52:13,wallstreetbets,"We have to protect retail here. This loss is far to massive. I have 20k to add to my position today for another round of smacking. I did the best I could scooping up 2k shares giving me 4.25k total.

I really want retail to win and see those 11s excercised."
2021-06-17 16:47:38,wallstreetbets,Check my posts for TA were banging between two clear trend lines even with dead low volume.
2021-06-17 17:27:57,wallstreetbets,I’ve got august 20 calls take me to fucking tendie town
2021-06-17 16:10:22,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it fam, buying more UWMC tomorrow whether or not there’s a juicy dip. Let’s burn these fuckers"

2021-06-17 16:50:14,wallstreetbets,"I have $12 & $13’s, please please help."
2021-06-17 17:07:22,wallstreetbets,"Not entirely sold on quad witching, but UWMC is a safe bet to keep going up and it has the potential to blow. 

I’m all in"
2021-06-17 18:26:58,wallstreetbets,"I didn't understand a \*\*\*\*ing thing you said, but I'm in!"
2021-06-17 17:32:09,wallstreetbets,Last quarter’s witching day was a big bust.  I hope you’re right though.
2021-06-17 18:16:24,wallstreetbets,The stock you can’t fuck up
2021-06-17 19:01:41,wallstreetbets,Could UWMC gamma really be attainable? 🤞🤞🤞
2021-06-17 17:06:15,wallstreetbets,Been in UWMC since someone posted a solid DD about it months ago. It’s a great buy but low volume has kept it down for months. All it needs is that high volume and it’s free money
2021-06-17 17:53:04,wallstreetbets,"Seemed to be low volume this week, hope you're righr about this Wirthing Day. Seems a lot of cashgang  on the sidelines this week, but what do I know?"
2021-06-17 18:32:59,wallstreetbets,"Yep as long as UWMC is above $10 I’d consider it a win, $10.50 would be amazing as there has been major resistance from the hedge funds at that price range"
2021-06-17 17:08:59,wallstreetbets,I got 95 shares at 10.11 average. Let's light this rocket.
2021-06-17 18:40:18,wallstreetbets,"All in. The CEO claimed they’ll be #1 Lender in the US in less than 30 months. And this is trading sub-ten? Free money glitch, right here!"
2021-06-17 18:36:21,wallstreetbets,"I don't really know if there's any sort of squeeze play here, but I'm in at $65k in shares (6600 shares at 8.34 avg, up about 18%).  The upside this company has along with it's div makes it a really nice play.  I'm not playing this one at the casino personally, but wish you all luck tomorrow if you're pulling the lever."
2021-06-17 18:54:33,wallstreetbets,I hold 1k shares. And various calls itm and otm. I plan on adding 500 shares throughout the day tomorrow
2021-06-17 19:10:40,wallstreetbets,This is my largest holding at the moment so I love reading this shit.
2021-06-17 16:01:11,wallstreetbets,Just bought 100 shares!
2021-06-17 17:25:58,wallstreetbets,"I hope you're right!  But at the same time, I want to buy more options at a discount."
2021-06-17 17:45:25,wallstreetbets,"Yolo’d 10 calls expiring tomorrow for .10 , just in case yuh neva know , 😆"
2021-06-17 16:39:42,wallstreetbets,"Couldn't have said this better. Used to work at a hedge fund and traded off these all the time (June is like the Super Bowl for some of these places). Look around 3:45 for a potential move above $11. I've seen some wild exchange prints, so if that happens... Those calls will get triggered.  


I've been long this for a while (shares and Aug. and Dec. calls) - just my style to buy further dated options. Let's go and see what happens!"
2021-06-17 18:49:57,wallstreetbets,Im all in balls deep!
2021-06-17 18:52:18,wallstreetbets,I like this stock. Tomorrow I will buy more

2021-06-17 19:32:44,wallstreetbets,"Dang, just looking at options volume today and the 9, 10, 11s, we’re very high."
2021-06-17 19:45:30,wallstreetbets,Some one can take my 90 covered calls tomorrow at $11. I will just by back for $10.50 on Monday.
2021-06-17 19:47:25,wallstreetbets,This is great and all but I’m waiting for the octuple witching day
2021-06-17 17:52:16,wallstreetbets,Is it tomorrow yet?!? I can’t wait!!
2021-06-17 16:55:24,wallstreetbets,"""Everyone deserves a chance to fly even UWMC."" Elphaba, Wicked"
2021-06-17 17:59:18,wallstreetbets,closed my short call positions today and went in on 8/20 11c
2021-06-17 15:58:45,wallstreetbets,"I think UWM is a great company and the stock will almost certainly be double by next year if not sooner...however, there is nothing that says those ITM and OTM calls can’t be covered, which means nobody has to buy anything."
2021-06-17 16:39:53,wallstreetbets,"The 9c is trading at intrinsic value.  They are 100 delta contracts, that's the same as buying shares.  Granted that means the seller has 100 shares usually, so no gamma."
2021-06-17 17:13:59,wallstreetbets,Those fucker shorts need to burn alive
2021-06-17 16:41:57,wallstreetbets,This theory is based on the highly improbable (and borderline retarded) assumption that all of these calls are naked and completely unhedged.
2021-06-17 18:33:48,wallstreetbets,Why don't you gamma squeeze this nuts !!!
2021-06-17 17:22:00,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been selling calls on UWM for the last two weeks- but I closed out today. I had a bad feeling about tomorrow, but now it’s a good feeling."
2021-06-17 17:09:42,wallstreetbets,Buuuuut it won’t be. Because every quarter quad witching ends up being absolutely fucking dull.
2021-06-17 16:12:44,wallstreetbets,thats not how it works. market makers buy the shares to cover the calls as they go itm
2021-06-17 17:07:15,wallstreetbets,Anyone else remember the gamestore quad witching in March? These dates mean jack 😔
2021-06-17 18:43:57,wallstreetbets,"Actual TL;DR for reality: UWMC has a perfect storm brewing to increase in price, will dip 2% instead."
2021-06-17 19:17:02,wallstreetbets,"Every time people go “OMG quad witching!” and buy a bunch of shit because of it, a hedge fund manager gets their wings 

And by that I mean they get high off the cocaine from a whore’s ass paid for by the tendies people lost"
2021-06-17 17:38:54,wallstreetbets,"""Quad Witching."" WSB really thinks that hedge funds, market makers, and large institutions are not smart enough to check a calendar in advance."
2021-06-17 16:33:05,wallstreetbets,Quad witching is snake oil bullshit. Never base your trades on quad witching unless you have a koala based brain
2021-06-17 16:58:27,wallstreetbets,"Something always doesn’t work out with this one. Been buying and selling share and calls for some gains and losses over the past three months. Russell index mishap, earnings, share buyback, Russell again!!!!  What’s it going to take. Serious question. Any answers."
2021-06-17 16:41:59,wallstreetbets,"> First things first, a gamma squeeze is when there is a shitload of options open and expiring ITM forcing a bunch of shares to be bought up and causing the share price to go up

THAT'S NOT HOW THE FORCE WORKS!

A gamma squeeze only happens when a large number of new contracts are opened in a short amount of time with very high gamma and the market maker is unable to do their normal gamma hedging."
2021-06-17 17:21:46,wallstreetbets,My experience tells me: Usually nothing happens.
2021-06-17 18:07:28,wallstreetbets,Lmao dude
2021-06-17 19:18:42,wallstreetbets,"Sick of these posts, constant dick tease."
2021-06-17 17:43:57,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t everyone plan for this and it ends up not doing anything ?
2021-06-17 19:45:01,wallstreetbets,"This is so stupid.  No, they don't need to buy all those shares.  They either have them already or they were sold against existing calls and shares.  

And don't even worry about the REASON quad witching day makes prices go down, the fact that all those options expiring OTM have their collateral released.

Come on."
2021-06-17 18:53:22,wallstreetbets,Clearly y’all weren’t here for the quad spy witching hour
2021-06-17 17:46:54,wallstreetbets,Not this theory again..
2021-06-17 17:57:10,wallstreetbets,"The vast majority of those calls for the 9 and 10 strikes are already covering shares, meaning that the shares have already been bought. So any volume to push it up past 11 has to come from other sources, not force buys from those calls going ITM. If it somehow does move strongly past 11 then some interesting possibilities do open up, but that's going to be a very tough mountain to climb given the volume we've had this week."
2021-06-17 17:31:40,wallstreetbets,"Or, what’s more likely, is maximum pain is kicked on and market makers find a way to push this stock down to 9"
2021-06-17 19:05:43,wallstreetbets,"Haha, okay. I'm retarded but I'm not falling for that shit again."
2021-06-17 16:22:10,wallstreetbets,AMC gonna gamma bruh
2021-06-17 19:07:14,wallstreetbets,"Gamma squeeze? Lol. NO FUCKING WAY. MM’s are already hedged on all those strikes. I’m not saying it can’t got to 12, but if it happens it’s not from a gamma squeeze. Too many newbies trying to hype stocks using terms they don’t even fully understand. If UWMC was at 3$ per share for the last 3 months and just popped to 9$ today a gamma squeeze could be in play. But that’s not the case A GAMMA SQUEEZE WILL NOT OCCUR IN UWMC THIS WEEK OR NEXT. PERIOD."
2021-06-17 19:35:55,wallstreetbets,Sorry not going to happen. Will close at $9.95. Watch and learn
2021-06-17 18:58:52,wallstreetbets,"MM’s hedge their position by buying roughly 50 shares when selling a call, and depending if the contract is ITM by expiration date they’ll buy the other 50 progressively, or sell their original 50 if it’s OTM. Your calculations are wrong"
2021-06-17 19:58:40,wallstreetbets,I thought saying the word squeeze got your shit taken down lmao
2021-06-17 19:36:13,wallstreetbets,"Ummm, where is all this OI you’re talking about?
Looks quite low or am I missing something"
2021-06-17 19:53:52,wallstreetbets,Trash...go away
2021-06-17 18:23:09,wallstreetbets,RIP
2021-06-17 17:20:10,wallstreetbets,"I bought that dip @ 6.70 and sold it in the mid 7s. Then I bought back in high 7s and sold in the mid 8s. And I bought back in one more time in the high 8s and have been holding for a few weeks, averaged up over the last couple days.  Sitting at 850 @ 9.35.

If I was smart I would have just held from 6.70 and been up a lot but I'm not complaining about 20% and a bright future."
2021-06-17 17:26:53,wallstreetbets,Not a bad contract to be holding haha. You gonna try to exercise any of those bad boys?
2021-06-17 17:53:10,wallstreetbets,I might dump all of my “safe” bank stocks tomorrow and buy more UWMC instead. It might be a safer bet.
2021-06-17 17:49:32,wallstreetbets,Never change internet. Never ever fucking change.

2021-06-17 17:43:09,wallstreetbets,"$10 calls are cheap, they closed at like $.13 so a $13 bet could easily go in your favor, so good call there"

2021-06-17 17:54:44,wallstreetbets,Are you me?

2021-06-17 17:20:33,wallstreetbets,"Regulation SHO  
  
A Threshold Security is defined by Rule 203(c)(6) of the SEC's Regulation SHO as any equity security of an issuer that is registered under Section 12, or that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act where for five consecutive settlement days: (1) there are aggregate fails to deliver at a registered clearing agency of 10,000 shares or more per security; (2) the level of fails is equal to at least one-half of one percent of the issuer's total shares outstanding; and (3) the security is included on a list published by a self regulatory organization.  
  
Reg SHO is designed to fulfill several objectives, including: (a) the establishment of uniform locate and delivery requirements in order to address problems associated with failures to deliver, and (b) the creation of uniform marking requirements for sales of all equity securities.  
  
Accordingly NYSE will post a list of threshold securities on this site for every settlement day. Note: The Threshold List will not be generated on bank holidays when the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is closed but equity exchanges are open.

UWMC is on that threshold list:

UWMC has been on that threshold list since 4/28:

There is more than one reason there could be FTD's, but considering the extremely high short volume for the past few months, it wouldn't be a stupid wager to think there is naked short selling.

2021-06-17 17:03:53,wallstreetbets,"as they go up , don't even need to be ITM 

 delta = how many shares they buy/sell to hedge when they sell you the call/puts , gamma = how many additional shares they buy/sell every $1 it goes up or down"
2021-06-17 17:13:34,wallstreetbets,This is not correct.
2021-06-17 18:00:25,wallstreetbets,Yes except the amount of calls in the money or close to is way higher here

2021-06-17 18:03:28,wallstreetbets,The $10 calls were about 37 percent “covered” at close today
2021-06-17 19:54:25,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t work like that
2021-06-17 18:32:34,wallstreetbets,Yes exactly!!!! THIS STOCK WILL RIP😉🤝😔🌠🚀
2021-06-17 19:52:03,wallstreetbets,Profit is profit don’t hit yourself
2021-06-17 17:32:41,wallstreetbets,"I’d like to, but I’m probably going to sell to close tomorrow just since I don’t have $55k liquid there and I don’t want to sell anything to cover.

If it magically pops another $6 then we are talking."
2021-06-17 17:54:19,wallstreetbets,"Wait a second, only legends would do that. Did a legend just reply to my comment?"
2021-06-17 17:13:37,wallstreetbets,"You were just the gambler we were looking for. But yeah, you’re right. Solid solid stock, separate from any short term catalysts or otherwise. Although gamblers will still undoubtedly enjoy the thrill of UWMC’s gains, it is also a compelling choice for the reasonable man."
2021-06-17 18:10:50,wallstreetbets,"Let’s not forget about the share buyback already in progress, specifically to increase shareholder value says Matt Ishbia"
2021-06-17 19:20:02,wallstreetbets,I only have 50 11s but let’s hope we aren’t completely fucked tomorrow.  Not looking too promising.
2021-06-17 17:51:52,wallstreetbets,It’s been stressful holding them lol I went full degen a few weeks ago
2021-06-17 19:51:08,wallstreetbets,"he’s referring to We as retail, which I’m assuming you are"
2021-06-17 17:35:15,wallstreetbets,"Oh I’ve got 169 currently, up from what was 69 shares. And 96 calls, lots of 6’s and 9’s here. Must be a good sign"
2021-06-17 19:53:35,wallstreetbets,BURN!  🔥
2021-06-17 18:31:00,wallstreetbets,Jesus Horatio Christ
2021-06-17 19:08:10,wallstreetbets,What did you pay for them? Sorry not trying to rub it in. Just curious.
2021-06-17 17:21:12,wallstreetbets,good lookin out
2021-06-17 19:14:04,wallstreetbets,Already rekt so no worries there
2021-06-17 18:13:28,wallstreetbets,With July calls you should have a chance if it even runs a bit
2021-06-17 19:40:18,wallstreetbets,Do not buy covered calls if you expect the price to rocket. Lol.
2021-06-17 18:23:10,wallstreetbets,"Ok so let’s assume UWMC is on the list, and has remained on the list for some time now, because of naked short selling. 

What makes you think naked shorts won’t simply decide to stay naked shorts? In other words, if they haven’t covered in the past, why would they bother covering tomorrow?"
2021-06-17 17:13:18,wallstreetbets,This is correct.
2021-06-17 17:53:41,wallstreetbets,Gamma Hedging.
2021-06-17 18:21:22,wallstreetbets,Source?
2021-06-17 19:15:34,wallstreetbets,"Delta on the 10 strike is close to 0.50 so about 50% covered, and delta on the 9 is 1.

So that's about 75% of the 9C and 10C calls covered."
2021-06-17 17:33:57,wallstreetbets,Understandable. Scrounging up $55k in cash isn’t the easiest of moves. But congrats on the gains so far (hopefully higher by tomorrow!)
2021-06-17 18:41:17,wallstreetbets,Why not sell part of them and exercise the rest? Not financial advice.
2021-06-17 18:42:35,wallstreetbets,Maybe sell some and exercise the rest?
2021-06-17 18:00:31,wallstreetbets,69? nice
2021-06-17 19:10:45,wallstreetbets,"It don't bother me man, I paid 650? I'm pretty sure. It was worth 12,000 at its peak and rn its worth about 200 but nobody in hell would buy it so I mark it up as worthless. If tomorrow pops the way this post describes itd probably be worth 20kish comparing it to when it popped to 12k but I'm not getting my hopes up lol"
2021-06-17 19:16:35,wallstreetbets,Very good question.
2021-06-17 18:34:16,wallstreetbets,"Go to the option chain, select the $10 call for 6/18, the delta will tell you the amount hedged that call is, it closed at .38557 meaning 39%, meaning for every $10 call contract the market maker should have 39 out of the 100 shares available to be purchased. Options don’t trade after hours so it would not be updated for after hours activity. That’s the source."
2021-06-17 18:54:52,wallstreetbets,"That’s a viable option, going to decide around 10am myself.

My position on that account is 7690 shares at 7.6969, so I’m hesitant to ruin that. 🤣"
2021-06-17 18:44:05,wallstreetbets,What if I like the stock though?
2021-06-17 19:36:46,wallstreetbets,Damn. You were up almost 20x?
2021-06-17 18:57:32,wallstreetbets,"WeBull showing .4859 now, been following along all day. .4004 on Robinhood"
2021-06-17 18:36:44,wallstreetbets,"Ah, I understand, thanks for the explanation."
2021-06-17 19:39:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but its my first options trade and a mistake I learned the hard way. Options are nooot like shares that shit tanked quick. It was a really good lesson so Im not even tripping."
2021-06-17 19:31:55,wallstreetbets,"Correct, so added to the nearly 100% of 9C covered this is about 75% of the 9 and 10 strike calls already covered."
2021-06-17 19:50:16,wallstreetbets,I used Fidelity
2021-06-17 16:04:03,wallstreetbets,I wrote a DD today and mods took it down aftwr 10 mins cuz some people complained about me pumping and dumping. Oh well! I am up 40% already after I bought the dip in morning :)
2021-06-17 16:51:02,wallstreetbets,wow- another believer! Glad you like the fundamentals.
2021-06-17 16:12:35,wallstreetbets,"PRPL gang, the most polite old school gang as I remember.

Got some FDs and few July $30 calls, let's see if this does indeed swing.

2021-06-17 15:57:21,wallstreetbets,Insiders are selling their shares a week ago . That’s not a good sign .

2021-06-17 16:51:54,wallstreetbets,They sold 7M of their 14M position and I believe they still have warrants to buy another 3M shares.

2021-06-17 17:20:09,wallstreetbets,Ik lmao
2021-06-17 16:55:52,wallstreetbets,Glad you're in. WSB will come around. u/Sir_jack_a_lot is going to get on PRPL train. IMHO there is tons of upside and very very limited downside. We are trading @ like 1.7X sales and growing 40% YOY.... and we are profitable...... It's still an under followed and underappreciated company.
2021-06-17 17:54:55,wallstreetbets,Ppl butthurt it seems
2021-06-17 18:29:11,wallstreetbets,Maybe this is a dumb question but what makes you say sir_jack_a_lot is going to pile into PRPL?
2021-06-17 16:57:34,wallstreetbets,I do have 7/16 calls tho. U think it will go up by then ? I dont have leaps

2021-06-17 16:58:20,wallstreetbets,"Dunno- I hope. I think they are planning an investor day this month. If Joe Megibow can lay out the story well, it could go up. I am still a fan of shares."

Take a look at r/microgrowery for a heads up.....i love weedmaps, and CEO was on tv a day or 2 ago....but one click from google will give you best deals/strains the same way, and i just dont wanna see people have false hopes....i am your target buyer, high tolerance loves new places and road trips....and the exact day it becomes fed legal i will grow mine and reduce my cost to smoke....im not planning on running to a dispensary and paying top dollar everyday....just the quality increase in the plant has reduced my consumption.....jmo, and again, i love the company, i would buy a share but i feel like the Market is anticipating something that isnt gonna take off.....u will go to the dispensary the same way u buy wine....maybe some nice stuff for a special occasion, but daily drinkers dont spend $50 on a bottle, they spend $10-20

2021-06-17 16:57:15,wallstreetbets,">They seem to be Yelp, Doordash and Square for the weed industry all under one company.

That's actually iHeartJane which is backed by the investors in those companies.  Weedmaps is weak at best."
2021-06-17 16:10:07,wallstreetbets,"CEO answers this question by explaining that they (Google, Yelp, and Leafly) have already and are already trying and failing."
2021-06-17 15:52:53,wallstreetbets,From my perspective the brand equity that weedmaps will and has been building beyond just using their app as a platform is where the difference is. I’d love to see google or Amazon buy them of course :) haha but I think we are going to see a deeply rooted brand Turn into a big player vs a big Corp trying to be super relevant in that market.
2021-06-17 15:54:24,wallstreetbets,"I think these next couple months and years, With their new team is going to be pivotal. They made it profitable thru some wild times with strict regulations. With the industry opening. I really got faith in this squad."
2021-06-17 15:55:18,wallstreetbets,My perspective is. It’s not JUST about their app. Which isn’t the greatest thing in the world. It needs work. But they are primed for a full refresh with being legitimate as a key priority.  Stoked to see tho
2021-06-17 16:37:06,wallstreetbets,"I hate to see questions like this thumbed down because they get lost in the discussion. It's a relevant question that a lot of investors have. 

It's not just a search engine for pot and dispensaries. 

""Yelp for Marijuana"" = NO/WRONG

""Google/Shopify Hybrid"" (for a new emerging industry[!!!]) = YES/CORRECT

This is a new industry and this company has such a large footprint established already, not just with dispensaries and customers and bringing the two together, they also provide businesses with a One-Stop shop solution and set up and marketing. Of all the companies associated with the marijuana industry right now, Weedmaps probably has the most consolidated data on any given topic within the industry.

Data, Marketing, SaaS.... They have it."
2021-06-17 16:00:16,wallstreetbets,"Nothing. And anybody that lives in a state where it’s already legal knows there’s shops on literally every corner. I dunno maybe you can make some bucks on the stonks but I just don’t see the same potential OP sees, which is fine.

I’ve got no clue what I’m talking about."
2021-06-17 16:35:10,wallstreetbets,"It’s not the consumer side it’s their SaaS subscriptions with dispos that are the real money maker.

WeedMaps provides enterprise software to cannabis businesses, running their point of sale (POS) services as well as aiding with logistics, regulatory compliance, wholesaling, and ordering. Clients (dispensaries) pay a monthly fee in a standard SaaS model, with fees for other optional services like featured posts or listing priority on the WeedMaps Marketplace."
2021-06-17 16:39:01,wallstreetbets,"I know a lot of ""lifelong potheads"" who don't use WeedMaps, but I see it as a place that is used largely by more casual smokers or people who have no idea where to start. I think it's an easy way to explore and pick up product if you're not a master doobie smoker. No matter what, there's a lot of people who will pay for convenience. I think the SaaS element is also pretty intriguing."
2021-06-17 16:34:47,wallstreetbets,"Yo I feel the same way for sure and I too am like you in a lot of ways. I’ve also already moved off dispensaries when local but I do sometimes have to use weedmaps when traveling and not familiar with locals yet. That said I always find myself wanting more to “consume” and experience when it comes to cannabis, like public events, music festivals, community farmers markets and media. That’s where I see them getting almost forced to focus to really make a splash long term even though they are already doing it in a sense as linked in my post but It’s just not something they are pushing as hard in public it seems just yet. So it’s basically more about their brand as a whole not just the app in my eyes. 

Also it’s worth mentioning the number of users vs non users today at this very moment is for sure skewed to non daily users (as much as we like to think everyone’s toking and getting shit done all day like us haha at least in my experience) so this leaves a huge market open and wanting a legit experience."
2021-06-17 16:39:06,wallstreetbets,"Yes but your bearish cases only look at the consumer facing aspects of WeedMaps. The other half provides business software to cannabis industry professionals. That’s the real money to be made. And vendors aren’t just gunna throw in the towel on weedmaps just because google exists. No. They will run listings and ads on both platforms, because that is what you have to do nowadays to be in and stay in business. Weedmaps has understood this in the 10+ years of being a profitable company, and continues to be very well poised to capitalize on this notion."
2021-06-17 16:45:22,wallstreetbets,Dispensaries will absolutely succeeded no matter what. Your average smoker is most definitely not going to grow themselves. This is like saying the alcohol industry had no chance because they’re inferior to moonshiners
2021-06-17 19:13:30,wallstreetbets,"Imagine how cheap booze was at your local speakeasy during prohibition.

Daily drinkers and put smokers will easily pay for good, quality product and convenience, especially high middle class and up.

I won't be growing my own plants, making edibles or toothpicks, or rolling my own joints. 

One could argue a person can brew their own beer or distill their own booze, but still the alcoholic beverage industry is huge!

I see your point, but if history serves us, we should at least consider that there will be big business tied to the marijuana industry, and weedmaps is the first company with a massive footprint in the industry who is publicly trading.

We've only just begun... It's bigger than most people understand."
2021-06-17 16:09:54,wallstreetbets,"High density is bullish for the company, more dispensaries mean discoverability is more valuable."
2021-06-17 16:34:33,wallstreetbets,"Your missing a key aspect of the company. They aren’t simply an weed discovery or ordering app. They provide cannabis industry retailers and vendors an entire suite of business software. If Google is gunna come around great, be that as it may. But every vendor will tell you they will still want their listings on Weedmaps AND Google concurrently. That is why you have businesses like restaurants listing their business on ALL platforms, google Yelp doordash grub hub you name it. Weedmaps has a tremendous upside where big tech players do not. If google or Amazon had any real interest they would have already started"
2021-06-17 16:38:56,wallstreetbets,"Well said. I for sure didn’t include a massive side of their business in my post as I hoped most people understood it. I was trying to show a different side of why I invested. But yes yes yes man. That’s a whole ball game right there. Love it. 

For those who haven’t.  For sure peep what is being sold now. Incredible tool and a focus on building a brand name that’s here to be a vehicle for cannabis"
2021-06-17 16:46:06,wallstreetbets,"I agree somewhat, but visiting dispensaries in RI MASS and NY i can say that they are for the most part, way overpriced, and inundated with redtape.  If u have ever gone to a farm, it is a much better deal, better product, and no middleman....there will always be a place for a dispensary, but there isnt a bodega maps, or liquorstore maps....it will be very easy when u go....i truly think people have priced in black market numbers, and its gonna bite the bottom line eventually....mephisto genetics have 2 month auto flowers, just add water.....are you really gonna pay 300 for something that costs you 10 bucks to grow?  U wont know a friend?, like its been for time eternal?  Just saying, be careful with this built up buzz....pardon the pun"
2021-06-17 16:49:28,wallstreetbets,"Not saying its a bad company, more like industry speaking....ill say it as clearly as i can....do you sell corn for $300 an ounce? Why not?  U realize weed is easier to grow than corn, hence the name....."
2021-06-17 17:02:22,wallstreetbets,"Right, to me its a consumer product, but i get that the red tape has caused inflation and logistics to the dispensary, causing a price rise....i guess my point is that while everyone assumes the unlimited growth of marijuana, take a look at tobacco and Budweiser....there is an underground vibe to cannabis that u cant replicate, and u will see a supply side crash 3 months after fed legal....because thats how long it takes for a plant to make it to your bong......"
2021-06-17 17:08:21,wallstreetbets,"They will exist, but if alcohol industry made $300 ounces of liquor, i would prob say that would increase moonshine sales, if it was, say $10 a bottle....."
2021-06-17 19:29:17,wallstreetbets,"I disagree, but not about consumption....simply that when laws are lifted, the effect will be price side, exactly like cigs and beer....one cig is fifty cents, a beer is a dollar...a joint is 12 dollars?  Why?  U should review how cheaply something is produced, and understand that if someone can double their angle, thats a good business.....i guess where the models fail is this: ur model of industry, what percentage of daily smokers will pay $500 dollars a week for something they ( or someone they know) grows it for a dollar a week.  What is that number?  Take a look at America .00001% grows marijuana right now.  It becomes legal 2mrrw.  How many people will decide they would rather buy stocks and grow their own.  Pesticide free.  Untumbled, full of kief.  But ur business model doesnt account for any of that"
2021-06-17 19:30:47,wallstreetbets,Put a price tag of $250 an ounce on your tomato stand.....how many people will buy those tomatoes?

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
2021-06-17 17:00:09,wallstreetbets,"Corn is cheap because it is subsidized and there exists a massive industry behind it already. Pot is expensive because of the crazy amount of quality people expect from it, that there are many hurdles and license requirements to jump through, and because people are consistently ready to pay these costs. Legalization won’t desaturate the industry. That’s just not even logical. It will heighten the industry with more being involved. Someone will be making money off of the many many more looking to begin cannabis business once legalization occurs and that somebody is called Weedmaps."
2021-06-17 17:10:34,wallstreetbets,"Like someone else said, not that many will start growing if it’s legal. Besides industry implications will enjoy a bolstering of ancillary effects, such as hydroponic and gardening suppliers, which Weedmaps can advertise for as well."
2021-06-17 17:11:01,wallstreetbets,"Weed industry is still so small. As competition increases, price decreases. Thats also one of the selling points of weedmaps; saving money"
2021-06-17 19:40:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. Well, we have differing perspectives, opinions, and experiences, and I respect that. 

I tagged the up arrow for you! 

Happy Juneteenth weekend!"
2021-06-17 17:13:04,wallstreetbets,"R/microgrowery....according to ur pricepoints, people are growing $1000’s of dollars of weed in 4x4 tents every month.....take a look at those pics, and then tell me why a govt sub to reduce corn prices is any different from govt inflating the price thru laws....the fed legality will tank prices....because again, its weed, easy to grow, sorry but thats the truth...."
2021-06-17 17:18:28,wallstreetbets,"Hope ur right, but ur wrong about microgrows....people will give buds to their friends at decent prices, and the dispensary will be when u fly out of town, not the daily thing people r expecting....now if u make the price $1 a gram, now im going to the dispensary every day like a pack of smokes and a coffee...but that is my point, u cant have it both ways....If u are a surfer, u may think a wavepool is really cool, but u cant spend $100 a wave"
2021-06-17 17:22:33,wallstreetbets,"Agreed its small, but will homogenize like cigs into a few dozen main brands, at which point price will tank from true capitalism....its too simple to grow, u are inflating its value because its illegal....how much was a bale of Hemp in 1900? That is what the legal market will look like, price adjusted for inflation, but NOWHERE near the “novelty” price being projected....jmo"
2021-06-17 19:54:47,wallstreetbets,U too good chat!!!
2021-06-17 17:22:24,wallstreetbets,"That’s not the case. These laws weren’t designed as tool sets to influence pricing. They are controlled substance laws. Tell me why an eighth of good weed costs more in ca now that’s it’s legal there compared to when it wasn’t.  
I’m balls deep in the cannabis industry. I know the ropes. When there is a realization that there is money to be made lawmakers do 180s. That is what we are seeing now with states legalizing. Legalization will barely influence price consumer has to pay. It will allievate costs to producers."
2021-06-17 17:23:10,wallstreetbets,Fed has no interest in lowering price consumers will pay. You know why? They want those tax dollars
2021-06-17 17:31:05,wallstreetbets,"You can certainly have it both ways. You can grow pretty much your hearts content in CA. I’m sure folks grow and give out to friends like you said. They do that with beer. But here we are in CA, as multi billion dollar industry here, with new dispensaries and companies opening daily. 

But also you might be missing the other retail aspects. As weed is legal, many stores that have never sold weed before will want cannabis products on their shelves. They will want quality legally obtained cannabis. This doors to distribution will flood open"
2021-06-17 17:33:35,wallstreetbets,"Hemp from the 1900s isn’t at all comparable to weed nowadays. Sure, you can buy shitty 10% weed off the street or even dispensaries for pretty cheap, but also understand the breeding of very high thc strains is actually really new. You kind of get what you pay for"
2021-06-17 17:31:06,wallstreetbets,"I know it lol....u know what a “duck stamp” is? Its like for hunters, an actual stamp u bought at post office i think....anyway a tax stamp on ur pot plants, still way cheaper than $20 a GRAM....say that slow....20 a gram?  Wont happen for long....and i agree it will be like cigs where the dispo sells them for x, and then taxed to 2x...so much that they sell it at cost, like 7-11 does with beer and smokes....and then who makes out, big pharma and gov.....and who wont tolerate that? Pretty much every stoner i know would buy off their buddy before they bought out of brixmortar.....the dispos seem amazing now, talk to me one year after legalization....it will be like tanning booths and card stores...strip mall sorrow"
2021-06-17 17:36:22,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, but if u kept all the marijuana produced in cali, in cali.....the price would tank.  Its so inflated by the black market.....u see smoke shops everywhere....but most people dont go to them....why?  They are the most knowledgable, have similar prices.....the reason is cigs are everywhere.....if u went to a smoke shop in ur hood....i would say maybe 1% of smokers in the neighborhood shop there......how much do they spend on internet advertising?"
2021-06-17 17:39:44,wallstreetbets,"How does it grow different from 100 years ago?  The genetics have improved, but the actual growth has not."
2021-06-17 17:36:28,wallstreetbets,"Uh ok dude no. Not how it will be at all. Again, look at states where it has been legal for some time. That’s all you need to know. Guess what you can buy crap beer and cigarettes at a shitty gas station anywhere right? But if you want good stuff you go to a craft beer store or a cigar shop. Why would it be any different for weed?"
2021-06-17 17:45:26,wallstreetbets,"With or without black market, cannabis revenue numbers don’t lie. Neither does the uptick in revenue streams Weedmaps measurablely has had post various state legalizations"
2021-06-17 17:41:35,wallstreetbets,"It’s just expensive to grow good weed. Unregulated mass produceable hemp, not so much"
2021-06-17 17:38:23,wallstreetbets,"If craft beer was 300 dollars a case, u would drink Schlitz"
2021-06-17 17:54:16,wallstreetbets,"They benefit from bordering illegal states....completely legal capitalist system drives prices down to near zero, just like hemp, dollars per pound, not grams.....fed legal will tank prices....bank on it"
2021-06-17 17:50:13,wallstreetbets,"I disagree, and if u have taken nothing from this convo, please acknowledge this: i am telling u, from 1900 to today,  years of breeding, that a first time grower can produce A grade cannabis in a closet with absolutely no experience.  I gave u the r/microgrowery page, just take a look at it.....if u want supply side take a look a macro.....the “industry” is great, but the numbers are way off....all paper tigers look good on paper"
2021-06-17 18:05:41,wallstreetbets,You are oh so wrong my friend. Are you even bothering to look at any numbers or economics behind this?
2021-06-17 18:12:34,wallstreetbets,"Free market capitalism let’s the market decide pricing. This is supply and demand. Guess what has been shooting up exponentially and will even more once legal? The demand. Therefore, when legal, coupled to freedom to set your own price points as a grower and retailer, prices will vary but it won’t get bogged down. Look at end of prohibition. Alcohol didn’t magically go down in prices when it was lifted. Sure you could get cheap stuff, but the price models were for the most part preserved, or were brought to levels that represented the public’s demand. That’s was the whole reason for lifting it. Economically it was more profitable to have stabilized pricing. That’s why pretty much across the board with weed you can expect to spend anywhere from 25 - 40 bucks on an eighth of good weed. Legalization brings stability to the markets, and that in turns preserved the supply demand aspects, and allows the industry to grow or contract accordingly"
2021-06-17 17:59:34,wallstreetbets,"Legitimate growers have expenses and overhead that people growing in their closets don’t. It’s just not comparable. Yes, dispensary weed is a little overpriced, but they make a shit ton regardless. It doesn’t make sense to say that a company who already nets several hundred million per year will shrink as the market grows. Dispensaries DO make money regardless of your opinion on the business model or not. I just don’t see how it becomes worse from here out"
2021-06-17 18:15:46,wallstreetbets,"I am looking at consumer price point, and inflation due to laws prohibiting neighboring production, grade A weed in a closet by first time growers, un tumbled, all kief is yours, no worries about pesticides used in commercial grow ops......r/microgrowery take a look....imagine if u could dm them and ask them how much?  U r living in a black market price world....its a weed, practically free...the genetics have progressed so much it will be produced like hemp, 5 dollars a pound.....just look at how many people are growing now....the consumption will increase, but profits will tank"
2021-06-17 18:20:30,wallstreetbets,"And lol...im looking at my backyard, and according to weedmaps i can grow about a 100,000 dollars worth of weed every 3 months with my acre, so why am i working?  Oh yea, its illegal....the day it goes fed legal, i would either quit my job and sell to all these new customers, or the price would drop to a point where i should work and buy my weed like smokes.....either case, the line around the corner model u see now is because of legal status, its not capitalism"
2021-06-17 18:24:28,wallstreetbets,Ill sell you an 1/8 for $15....best bud around.....what will u do?
2021-06-17 18:28:46,wallstreetbets,And amazon will sell and deliver ur 1/8 for $10....how is ur supply and demand now....nobody demanding a $40 1/8 from a brick and mortar when it can shipped to your door....or maybe Amazon doesnt believe in competition pricing lol
2021-06-17 18:08:33,wallstreetbets,"Tell that to the people that make blimps
And steam engines.....since u DONT grow, let me enlighten u how its done...after harvest its trimmed, tumbled, and all these crystals fall off, kief, which then is sold by the dispo....people who have tried hand grown know its a better deal"
2021-06-17 18:17:58,wallstreetbets,"What about tobacco, people could just grow that too right? Why hasn’t the tobacco industry suffered the way you say the weed industry will?! Case in point, so if you don’t mind we are done?"
2021-06-17 18:24:51,wallstreetbets,"Again, look at tobacco. Fully legal. Yet no one grows their own. Not enough to hamper an entire industry at least. Supply and demand my friend, it’s ALL about how it fits into capitalism, everything is in a capaitalist society. All legality has done is allow supply to be played with. Once that goes away stabilization occurs and producers act on demand. Economics 101 doesn’t matter if your talking about pig farming or weed"
2021-06-17 18:27:10,wallstreetbets,"Go to my shop because I get rewards there and also they throw in extras like joints, papers, lighters. Also you don’t get as good as weed as I already get, with or without shop"
2021-06-17 18:28:48,wallstreetbets,"And also shops provide consumers with choices and discovery, local weed guy not so much"
2021-06-17 18:36:41,wallstreetbets,"Amazon doesn’t decide the pricing, consumers do. You fixating on the price per unit. It really isn’t about cost per unit going up and down it’s about, like I’ve said a hundred times already, the stability of prices across the board. Guess what the local pot seller is going to have to do if prices go down. Their prices aren’t gunna stay the same! They’ll be forced to lower their prices even more to keep their assumed market share of those in their locale. Thus, offer less quality weed. Or make way more sales. Good luck to them. Plus growers will have more freedom to enjoy stable supply chains with legal shops something not afforded to them under current laws. There will be more incentives for growers to be compliant because there will be more money to be made."
2021-06-17 18:23:11,wallstreetbets,They dont sell tobacco for 20 a gram
2021-06-17 18:34:03,wallstreetbets,"I agree, because the cost is down....imagine a cigar cost $250 dollars....a normal one, not some high end....that is marijuanas pricing now.....but it grows as easy as tobacco....what dont u see?  Do u honestly think prices will stabilize at $25 an 1/8?  It doesnt hold logic, and realistically u should ask a farmer how much to grow an acre of pot, and use that number instead of your retail based on a black market"
2021-06-17 18:39:55,wallstreetbets,"Lol, maybe bro....but i just went to RI, scored some GG4 from Slater, and i can tell you i will never visit there again the day its legal in my state, not that the weed wasnt good, the best they had....but at $17 dollars a gram, i can do much better.  Like would u rather buy an ounce, or buy some stock and smoke ur own"
2021-06-17 18:36:25,wallstreetbets,"Amazon will give u every choice at the cheapest price possible, no where close to what a dispo charges"
2021-06-17 18:44:08,wallstreetbets,"Amazons delivery network, logistics, and reliability will be unmatched by brick and mortar....look at every business in America, before Amazon, and after.....as a business, dispos will look like a mom and pop pharmacy, competing against CVS"

2021-06-17 16:45:49,wallstreetbets,"Found it weird that the price dropped almost 10% on very little volume in AH. 

$20.87 -> $18.78 with 136K in volume? 

For comparison, the first dip in the morning went from $20.99 -> $20.50 on around the same volume. I usually don't put huge weight on the DD on here but the ""resetting the clock"" posts are starting to describe some of the activity that's going on with ARVL."
2021-06-17 15:44:15,wallstreetbets,ATH is a lot higher than $21.62

2021-06-17 19:06:52,wallstreetbets,I heard the drop was based on warrants that were exercise not a buy or sell order so the warrants shouldn't affect the volume much since its the introduction of new shares into the pool.
2021-06-17 19:34:17,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking of warrants too, but even if they were all executed and sold, that's still an small volume that drove down the price by 10%"

2021-06-17 18:02:33,wallstreetbets,"As a fellow type 1 diabetic I couldn’t agree more with your first assessment of the glucose monitoring systems sucking . They’re beyond uncomfortable and always come off with any type of Physical activity , or on a humid day sometimes just from sitting down it can start to peel. I’ve even had mine go bloody around the tape part and I’ve never had that happen once with my insulin pump site . Having 2 double down on the injection sites just causes more long term damage to my skin because I only rotate injection site spots between 2 different locations . My body can only take so many injections per year before I’m looking at permanent scarring . I hope and pray SENS can lead us to the promise land! Let’s go for the sake of current and future diabetics !!"

2021-06-17 16:12:41,wallstreetbets,"im a type 1 and also a medical doctor. hopefully we see more improvements in this field. i still do fingersticks and shots, because i dont like wearing something 24/7 for the reasons you mention.  This implantable one sounds promising though.  Eventually one day we will have an implantable device that can read our sugars.. then bluetooth communicate to an insulin pump (this could also be subcutaneous)... and you would basically have an artificial pancreas."
2021-06-17 16:06:12,wallstreetbets,the insertion and removal of the sensor is definitely kinda questionable but ik the hassle with the current CGMs might actually make it worth it in the long run. if they can improve their tech making it smaller and last longer i think they could shoot for a table with the big boys in the future. but what the hell do i know. either way i’m in

And no, not everyone is going to want an implant and that’s ok. SENS doesn’t need to take 50% market share to be successful. The market is huge. I don’t give a shit if you invest in this or not, I just love the company and potential like OP.

Prolly find it on the inter webs. 

C8 MediSensors. Used Ramon Spectroscopy. It was external, Bluetoothed to an open source app that was easily customized. 

GE took over the board and now $20M worth of tech sit in a warehouse in California. 

Once it’s out of court I’m sure it will end finger sticks and the bullshit harpoon CGMs."

SENS at 1.41B market cap compared to Dexcom at 38.9B. Let’s assume SENS can take away a quarter of Dexcom’s market share… that would put SENS somewhere around $28-30. jEsUs CHrIsT."

2021-06-17 15:29:00,wallstreetbets,"As long as the overall US federal government continues to clutch its pearls that little Tommy smoking weed will cause him to become a mass murderer, TLRY isn’t flying into the atmosphere anytime soon.

Also, bad financials will really really hurt this ticker. See March to May of this year. What a goddamn slow, prolonged beat down."
2021-06-17 16:30:23,wallstreetbets,"Tilray is a canadian company. Connecticut is in the United States. Stop with the attempted pump of TLRY. It's not a winner. It never has been. It never will be. 

If you're truly playing on the legalization of pot in America you would be in on TCNNF, CURLF, VFF, PLNHF, and GRWG.

Sucks to be stuck upside down in a dead stock, but you are... Don't want to see dumbass shit like this again - people are losing money because they listen to idiots who make desperate Reddit posts when they're losing money."
2021-06-17 16:25:19,wallstreetbets,TLRY is also canadian... lmao OP is a desperate idiot upside down in a Tilray position. CURLF stands to gain bigly with the legalization of pot in the Northeast. TCNNF gains as pot's legalized in the south.
2021-06-17 16:02:51,wallstreetbets,"Read my comments. I'm certainly not saying Connecticut legalization news DIRECTLY relates to TLRY, but it has industry wide implications.

It's the same as if Florida made a ruling about vegetarian/vegan alternative patties being able to label their product as a hamburger in fast food settings. This isn't news about Beyond Meat but it definitely has implications."
2021-06-17 17:38:28,wallstreetbets,"Honestly the best play to capitalize on USA legalizations is the newly merged $MAPS. Weedmaps is the leader of weed e-commerce and doesn't even touch the plant. They provide stores with tools and regulatory guidance needed to succeed, and they bring in hella customers with the app. 

They also advertise on Pornhub. That's bullish."
2021-06-17 19:48:12,wallstreetbets,Columbia Cares?
2021-06-17 15:09:13,wallstreetbets,Of course it is does. It may not directly impact Tilray but the industry wide implications of recreational legalization in more states in the biggest overall market in the world are positive.
2021-06-17 15:18:08,wallstreetbets,"Not everything is a pump. It's news about a highly talked about ticker with substantial holdings, market cap, etc. This isn't SNDL. With the Aphria merger they are an established player in recreational, medical and most importantly the beverage space with Sweetwater. I don't think TLRY is a P&D scheme and based on fundamental, not technical analysis I do think they have a future."
2021-06-17 15:31:20,wallstreetbets,"For sure. Once again, not a P&D. Industry news about an established company with growth potential."
2021-06-17 15:34:55,wallstreetbets,"Also, our politicians aren't being directed by some inner debate about the morality of marijuana. This is a border issue through and through. Mexico is still the most dominant player in marijuana and the cartels are absolutely putting pressure on Mexico City to hold the US off on legalization until they have time to pivot (reference 🥑 trade). The US plays ball because immigration is a bigger priority than marijuana and a larger homerun for reelection campaigns."
2021-06-17 16:33:05,wallstreetbets,">See March to May of this year. What a goddamn slow, prolonged beat down.

That was speculation surrounding the merger with APHA... Neither stock should have ever gotten that high as the merger had a fixed value that placed TLRY in the mid-high 20s - it has since been downgraded... If you were buying Tilray at 50, 60+ - or anything over the mid 20s for that matter - you're a fucking imbecile."
2021-06-17 16:46:44,wallstreetbets,"Add something to the discussion or at least read the previous comments. Tilray has better acquisitions, mostly that came along with APHA than any other seller of marijuana on the market. I'm fully aware that TLRY is Canadian, but Connecticut is in the UNITED STATES. 

That's the key here. I'm not lookimg for a push this week. The United States sets the stage, whether early or late to the party. Any state introducing legalization news is MAJOR news to the world market and the eventual end of prohibition. Even in the 20's when the US was way behind the curve with alcohol it wasn't until the US legalized that the international exchange/distribution of alcohol really took off. 

I'm honestly a little dumbfounded how these comments can't deal with nuance in anyway. International markets move long term on trends, not direct transactions or individual pieces of legalization. Maybe I'm in the wrong forum with a touchy name...."
2021-06-17 19:46:24,wallstreetbets,The best play for most people is prob MSOS. Tilray is def not the best weed company to invest in.
2021-06-17 19:09:59,wallstreetbets,"Weedmaps can be replaced by google search.  And it already has been.  It was a roundabout idea because google wasnt allowing search results for marijuana, until it became legal in canada.  Now all i need to do is google it and weedmaps is outdated."
2021-06-17 19:46:38,wallstreetbets,MSOS
2021-06-17 19:16:25,wallstreetbets,"Google does not provide the hardware, software, storefront, and existing customer base that Weedmaps has. Their business isn't just a map. It's a full service SaaS platform... A ""business in a box"" much like Shopify provides. Any small business with a license can sign up with Weedmaps and instantly start selling with all regulatory taxes and issues taken care of. Google can't do that."
2021-06-17 19:17:36,wallstreetbets,"Lol weedmaps is just a map with bells and whistles.  All a consumer wants is "" where is the weed?"" Great ill go buy that now thx."
2021-06-17 19:19:44,wallstreetbets,You are only looking at it from a consumer perspective. You don't even know their primary business model is B2B? Take a look at their investor deck. The profit margins and year over year growth is nuts.

2021-06-17 16:04:22,wallstreetbets,Doesn't move enough. A dividend play for most
2021-06-17 17:52:15,wallstreetbets,"Lots of reasons. In the car now but later tonight I can give your comment some more color. 

TLDR: MRO is great. Acreage is an issue. As they move further from Tier 1 their ecos get worse. I think holding your shares is leveraging you to oil, they have a fairly good beta. Oxy has more beta to oil and their acreage is just starting to get drilled. 

IMO, they paid down debt to get FCF up and start stockpiling cash for an acquisition. Their management is completely not shit (IE Oxy and Vicky Hollub are a nightmare). I just think the risk reward ratio on OXY is higher. Way more risk but fairly under priced. One thing I don’t know is what are MRO’s hedges at? That might be a reason."
2021-06-17 16:36:30,wallstreetbets,They are down bad today after the sell off 😅
2021-06-17 15:24:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. OXY looks kinda shit though. All O/G are losing money, sure.

What about a smaller company. CPE; EPS is dogshit. -70 but their FWD is 10; 2B company seems like better upside.

What about a larger. MPC -1.28 EPS. 3.48 FWD; 40B company.

OXY is smack in the middle. 20B company. -14 EPS with -0.5 FWD.



This is only one data point but it doesn't shine well on OXY"
2021-06-17 18:39:49,wallstreetbets,Thanks for responding. Yeah as long as you don’t mind spending the time if appreciate it. There’s still a lot of factors I’m not aware of when it comes to investing and what to look for when choosing prime candidates.
2021-06-17 16:49:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah maybe push them back a bit. Pay for the time. Theta wrecks a ton of options. However we should see some uptick MoM.
2021-06-17 15:43:17,wallstreetbets,Faith on the cycle will improve EPS. The Q1 was negative because of the freeze impacting the production in a large part of the Permian. CPS is shit and are in a deep hole. Too much risk. SM hedged so I hate them. (Great job at $40-50 hedge lol...) MPC doesnt have good acreage. Only down from here. Try a EOG doesnt look bad in that instance. Also they are sitting on a large exploration play that hasnt been talked about yet.
2021-06-17 15:46:37,wallstreetbets,"Yeah idk it could be a good play.

However I guess the thing is if the value of the stock market is 6 months ahead of the actual state of the market, then the growth and oil from the increase in usage with covid restriction relief  would already be priced in no? Like these companies are all way up on the 6 month charts"
2021-06-17 16:33:47,wallstreetbets,"In theory yes, however there are significantly less investors left in the O/G space. It’s only 3% of the S&P"

2021-06-17 16:02:53,wallstreetbets,If you use a 4 hour MA it looks like it was bouncing off that this week and support would indicate around 57.5 and up to 58 if it closes around here.
2021-06-17 17:44:14,wallstreetbets,Um no? I’m talking about the second time. The halts were because of the violent movement. If price moves 10% within 5 minutes trading is halted for ANY broker. Stop losses getting hit and people getting scared and paper handing didnt help
2021-06-17 17:58:44,wallstreetbets,I dont use any indicators
2021-06-17 17:49:31,wallstreetbets,I know why halts happen. I'm saying Robbinghood didn't allow for any buying for a while longer than most. I'm not sure why you are explaining fundamental stuff to me; lol.
2021-06-17 17:51:46,wallstreetbets,"No, I’m explaining it because you’re talking about when they restricted buying because of margin reqs. That happened on the first runup which can be argued caused the first dump. On the second dump on the second runup, trading continued as soon as other brokers. No broker specific halts happened right before that dump."

1. $CLF makes complete sense if you understand the fundamentals going on here (or if you don't and like money it should make sense in that way to you as well). 
2. You cannot just cut down steel trees and all the steel producers aren't getting burned again and WILL not go to full capacity to get killed by overcapacity and price drop they have clearly telegraphed this in their earnings calls last quarter and as well as this quarter for those who have reported thus far. 
3. Steel companies are adjusting guidance to be more positive, beating the adjusted guidance and paying down debt all at the same time pretty much across the board   


There is so much positive news for the industry i'm having trouble to even decide what to share"
2021-06-17 15:46:44,wallstreetbets,What do you think of vale? People have been down on them for fucking some shit up but who really cares I think. I think you get a better discount on them then CLF atm. Both solid but I could see vale having a quick catch up pop.

2021-06-17 17:19:23,wallstreetbets,"The global market for STEEL is in one of the most ludicrous situations of any commodity (SEMIs are the closest comparison).  

Basically… two years ago China produced roughly 50% of the global supply of steel.  Now, China is fighting their own industry to reduce pollution (steel production is a massive contributor to their carbon emissions and the lack of sunlight in Beijing).  Remember… the Beijing Olympics are going on in 2022 and they want to have a good showing for Beijing including blue skies.  

We literally went from the Chinese government giving rebates to steel producers to push them to export (to keep production high and as many steelworkers employed) to demanding production cuts, removing rebates, and now talking about export TAXES in an attempt to keep steel inside China for their own consumption.  You can see it any of the HRC futures charts (hot rolled coil… the standard for futures pricing for steel) how the Chinese price is now moving in different directions from the US/EU prices.  

Now add to that the import tariffs on foreign steel, record low inventories from steel consumers not buying steel during the pandemic, and post pandemic economic activity skyrocketing and you can see some of the factors pushing the price higher. 

From a macro economics standpoint, the shift in the global steel market from 2019 to today will be written about.

They are trying everything they can to keep their domestic commodities prices low so they can build. There are rumors of an export tax coming soon, if that comes to fruition it will be very good US and European steel.

China is losing their grip on the global commodities markets, they can only tap reserves so much."

A vertically integrated company like CLF is gonna tear the roof off. They mine their ore, transport it themselves and they are the largest HRC manufacturer in the US. They are paying down debt and the CEO said he will buy back shares if the price gets too low. CLF also now owns MTs North American assets.

TX and STLD are also the only companies bringing new mills online this year.  With both being located in the Southwest of the US (where economic activity is positively BOOMING) I am confident their release will beat cheeks.  

Then again, there is no reason for the market to have done us this dirty this week at all.  🤨"
2021-06-17 16:17:20,wallstreetbets,"I think the common thesis is supply chain issues, and high demand as nations turn to infrastructure spending to stimulate the economies. China meanwhile has retreated from the international steel market in order to keep prices lower domestically."
2021-06-17 19:38:18,wallstreetbets,"A lil bit of both. 

Demand side we have Biden infrastructure plan, which require alot of steel.  CLF sells a majority of it's steel to auto manufacturers, which are also running hot rn.

Supply side: China stopped exporting steel to US, because they building their own infrastructure and Trump's shipping / tarrifs makes Chinese steel more expensive thus giving making American steel more competitive.

I believe steel will continue to run hot until at least mid 2022. Also CLF expecting massive like blow out earnings coming in July."

2021-06-17 19:07:31,wallstreetbets,"Currently the price of steel in China doesn't have much impact on CLF.  If all of those worst case scenarios happened, it would only matter for CLF, if on top of those:

1. The 232 tariffs were cancelled for China (not going to happen)
2. Freight costs dropped (they're sky high)
3. Supply chain issues were solved (they're all jammed up)

China is trying to produce less steel for environmental reasons, but keep it as cheap as possible, so as a result they are trying to disincentivize exports.  First they eliminated export tax rebates on most steel products, and there's rumors of an additional tax on top happening in July."

2021-06-17 16:26:29,wallstreetbets,China has been implementing policies to prevent their steel from being exported because they need it for all of their infrastructure goals. They removed steel export rebates earlier this year and there is now chatter on a possible export tax for steel.

The market still hasn’t priced in the earnings potential for 2021-22 based on the insane spot prices.  

That’s why CLF has a new PT of 39 from JPM while STLD has a $107 PT.  The big money analysts have generally been way off the mark on understanding the steel industry dynamics."
2021-06-17 18:05:08,wallstreetbets,"CLF has been trading in an upward channel, currently it's near the bottom of said channel. If it holds it'll likely touch 25 in July. This is most likely a long term cycle. Profitability going up with low PE ratios due in most part because the market doesn't believe it's not at the end of it's cycle (steel being a cyclical of course).

So that's the risk you're taking, priced on a PE basis like it's at the end of a cycle but earnings, demand, and lack of supply like it's just getting started."

The supply is limited because furnaces take years to bring into operation and outside of a new operation by stld coming online this year,  nothing is in the works.

Demand is constant because the main buyers of steel, like the auto industry, will eat the cost when the alternative is not making a car

I then opened another spread yesterday (497.5/495) for a credit and as of today will be able to close it and keep everything, all with the ability to open ANOTHER for the same expiration.

2021-06-17 15:02:42,wallstreetbets,Spread makes those premium cancel each other so you can afford them at reasonable prices
2021-06-17 15:07:50,wallstreetbets,"Maybe but keep an open mind and think for a second.....

You can turn that naked put into a put spread and then you wouldn't make 1800% but still a decent 650%.....eg next weeks 3480/3490 call spread is trading for $5 and 3410/3390 Put spread is trading for $3.5.....so in theory one can buy the call spread and sell the put spread for net 1.5 and if AMZN stays above 3490, they collect 10 for the efforts...."
2021-06-17 19:02:34,wallstreetbets,"You are correct, what goes up comes down most of the times....I try to sell put spread/ buy call spread on down days and normally close them on a decent bump....but even then sometimes do get burned by 3,4,5 consequtive down days but it's rare."
2021-06-17 18:05:26,wallstreetbets,🤣
2021-06-17 14:55:22,wallstreetbets,Bought 3360/3370 call spread when AMZN was trading at 3375 a few days ago and financed it by selling 3295 put for a net credit of $60 and as long as AMZN stays above 3370 by tomorrow I collect 1000 more….Amazon is trading at 3480 now….
2021-06-17 15:35:50,wallstreetbets,"Combo wombo, that's how."
2021-06-17 15:41:09,wallstreetbets,"Yep I agree, been doing similar stuff in my Roth IRA account. Only selling put spreads on Top 50 market cap stocks…more than doubled that account from 8K to 20k in less than 8 months…."
2021-06-17 14:59:04,wallstreetbets,That's close enough.
2021-06-17 15:16:19,wallstreetbets,I suppose so. Too dangerous for my blood but true nonetheless
2021-06-17 15:54:59,wallstreetbets,I wish I knew how/what this means
2021-06-17 15:02:48,wallstreetbets,I respectfully disagree
2021-06-17 15:31:48,wallstreetbets,It's dangerous beyond doubt but is it more dangerous than Meme stocks?? anything that makes 100s% return in a few days is extremely dangerous. For me personally a bet that $AMZN won't go down 3%+ in a week seems less wild than saying that $AMC might be up 50% or down 50%......
2021-06-17 15:46:22,wallstreetbets,"Ok realized the gains now, closed the spread for 9.75 :)"
2021-06-17 16:02:40,wallstreetbets,You're correct.

2021-06-17 14:51:03,wallstreetbets,Options easy. You buy them to lose all your money but sometimes it backfires and you end up making money
2021-06-17 15:46:31,wallstreetbets,"You normally lose all your money. Don’t even try my monkey friend.

This OP here just got lucky. He’s literary gana lose all this money very quickly.
Easy come, easier go."
2021-06-17 15:11:53,wallstreetbets,I started trying to wrap my head around them about a month ago and it was painful. I finally spent about $20 and bought some calls and puts. It helps if you actually put it to practice. Plus I read a lot of investopedia and YouTube explanations. Don’t give up.

2021-06-17 14:50:46,wallstreetbets,Take your profits bro. It’s a lot worse losing money you had than realizing you could have made more.
2021-06-17 14:57:43,wallstreetbets,This is literally the best description of options I’ve ever seen.
2021-06-17 14:55:50,wallstreetbets,They should put that in the dictionary.
2021-06-17 15:09:34,wallstreetbets,"I backfired on my first option. Since then, been losing all my money. Currently have about 30 FOMO contracts, majority expire 7/16 with not alot of hope in sight but were riding it to 0 or a backfire because scared money dont make money.. this is not financial advice, coming from a smooth brained banana eating retard here. 🦍🍌"
2021-06-17 15:21:23,wallstreetbets,"But daddy, where do money come from ?"
2021-06-17 15:57:06,wallstreetbets,I traded options once with my ex basically telling me exactly what to do and we both made a couple hundred dollars! I was so excited. But he was incapable of explaining why he chose the price he chose and why he chose the date he chose in a way that my brain could understand. I've tried a couple times since and lost small amounts of money but I'll keep trying 🤷🏻‍♀️ I'm sure I'll get it eventually.

2021-06-17 18:54:02,wallstreetbets,I actually can walk away happy lol. I wish I could be more retarded but I don't have the balls. I like to live vicariously through people who have the balls though!

2021-06-17 19:17:56,wallstreetbets,"What I found works for me is to only sell on a run up when the premiums shoot up. I did that with GOEV a week ago, sold $12.5 6/18 calls for $2 a pop when it spiked to $11 and now they’re back down to $0.05 lol. Then I sell $9 puts on the way down because those premiums shoot up and I wouldn’t mind buying more at $9.

It’s risky with meme stocks though"
2021-06-17 19:00:30,wallstreetbets,"Nah, I sold CC on the last ""squeeze"". Got fat premiums @ a $30 strike. Nothing BB does is gonna get those called away before expiration."

I thought we might have reached the bottom at the time, but it kept goin down like the Titanic. I'm still very bullish. I like the stock. I've been long AMD and believe in the company.

2021-06-17 14:44:22,wallstreetbets,aw yeaaaah
2021-06-17 14:48:24,wallstreetbets,"1. PCSK9 doesn’t recycle the LDL receptor, it breaks it down. More receptor on the surface, more LDL pulled out of blood. Minor point but you don’t seem to have a good grasp on the science.

2. Existing PCSK9 inhibitors work super well but are extremely expensive. I imagine this would cost even more. Statins also work super well and they are dirt cheap. Who’s going to pay for this?"
2021-06-17 14:51:13,wallstreetbets,You had me until the end of the first paragraph... you could just say you're looking for a new stonk and whats next cuz you paperhanded amc or gme. 🤣
2021-06-17 14:35:06,wallstreetbets,He says I'm down  on GME 6/18 calls for 285$ each. Really feels like that moment in the casino before you head home with nothing 😅
2021-06-17 14:48:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, first day of trading so that was kinda bound to happen.  IPO was priced at $19 per share, but trading on the secondary market basically started at around $30."
2021-06-17 15:04:04,wallstreetbets,"Fair point.  I'd hope medicine goes more preventative long term as opposed to treating symptoms.  Also, some people don't tolerate statins well.   Do you have any insight into why companies are still cranking out PCSK9 inhibitors if statins do the trick already?"
2021-06-17 14:59:41,wallstreetbets,"I think the bitter old man in me came out there in that paragraph.  As soon as I typed short squeeze I couldn't contain the whining, haha."
2021-06-17 14:37:45,wallstreetbets,"I used to take the bus to a casino and the last bus back would leave at 2am. I would always be up at around 1:50am and decide, FUCK IT im gonna play the night and catch the morning 6am bus back. By 2:30 i was always broke and had to sit around and watch others make the tendies."
2021-06-17 14:53:22,wallstreetbets,Thanks for posting.  I’ve been buying a small number of shares of all of these companies.  I’ll watch it
2021-06-17 15:11:11,wallstreetbets,"PCSK9 inhibitors are basically reserved for the statin intolerant (there are some but it’s not a huge market) or those who are on maximally tolerated statin but still not at target. In some markets PCSK9 inhibitors are only reimbursed for people with familial hypercholesterolemia. The two drugs actually work on the same physiological pathway. I assume companies continue to market them because they can charge a lot for them and still make money even though it’s a bit of a niche product. I think the uptake has been a bit underwhelming though.

This is interesting because it’s theoretically a one time treatment, but I’d be interested to know the cost and if any insurer would foot the bill.

EDIT: statins are, in fact, preventative medicine. They reduce cholesterol, which is the cause of atherosclerosis, not a symptom of it. The difference is that one method is a daily pill and the other is a gene editing therapy. Here’s the problem - unless the gene therapy come with an enormous price tag, it doesn’t present much of a business case. So you end up having to compare an extremely expensive one-time treatment to a really cheap daily pill. It’s not even up to the consumer in most cases, your insurer will make this decision for you. There may be a market that is currently served by existing PCSK9 inhibitors. Still largely depends on price."
2021-06-17 14:39:11,wallstreetbets,I once was playing black jack and was betting 50$ on a 250 to bonus black jack game....the time I lowered my bonus bet to 1$ is when I hit the 250 to 1 bonus 🥲

2021-06-17 16:16:02,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been following this company since its inception and I’ve never been more confident of its success. 
They’ve been doing everything right; solid team, cutting edge engineering, beautiful designs, newly added manufacturing capabilities, decent marketing and they have their shit together financially.

I often think of that legendary post from bitcointalk in 2011 where some ape said “ [Gentleman, I’m pretty confident we are the new wealthy elite](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=12156.0)“ hoping to get a chance to feel that level of absolute confidence one day.
This is that day."
2021-06-17 16:06:26,wallstreetbets,"Wat happen today, i watch whole thing it was great"
2021-06-17 14:23:14,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for summarizing the investor day, sadly wasn't able to watch live. I'm long calls in this and will load up before the close today. I have Aug. and Dec. calls. Let's see what's up - short interest is really high (about 30%)."
2021-06-17 15:10:47,wallstreetbets,Congratulations! Please use Microvast battery for the EV.
2021-06-17 14:16:34,wallstreetbets,2038 will be a helluva year when they release their first model

2021-06-17 14:20:39,wallstreetbets,Hilarious. 2022 is so far away.
2021-06-17 15:24:23,wallstreetbets,?????
2021-06-17 19:48:41,wallstreetbets,I might steal this
2021-06-17 14:31:42,wallstreetbets,I love this company as an idea.. Hydrogen good batteries dumb but not ready to throw money at it yet . Still in my list of stocks to watch though
2021-06-17 14:57:48,wallstreetbets,All the renewable energy plays are decent. Be careful of extreme valuations. Just look at Sunpower the past few days. Full rocket ship.
2021-06-17 16:39:13,wallstreetbets,"I like these guys, but with GM teaming up with WAB to supply their fuel cell needs, PLUG is going to have an uphill battle competing with GMs massive market capitalization (GM aims to be fully EV by 2035). There will be a clear winner in the hydrogen fuel cell sector, but who that will be remains to be seen (I do own PLUG stock btw)."
2021-06-17 14:40:47,wallstreetbets,THis is actually the way

2021-06-17 14:33:09,wallstreetbets,Money.... And there lack there of wanting to invest it has caused this companies creeping for years.
2021-06-17 14:10:52,wallstreetbets,How so?
2021-06-17 14:32:14,wallstreetbets,"Leaving everything else be, how are they going to deliver hydrogen to filling stations? In its gaseous state it will literally leak out of the steel container through the crystalline structure of the steel, so you can't transport it in typical tankers. So you have to get small tungsten or palladium lined tanks and I'm sure that's not cheap. Even then, you have to keep it at a relatively low pressure or it will still leak. Or you can liquify it. Also not cheap and you risk boil-off as it turns back into a gas. And guess what happens when it turns back to a gas...

That's right. Overpressurizes the tank and leaks.

[Source](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/hydrogen_production.html)

So, pipelines? Go ask keystone how that shit worked for them. And that was just one pipe. Took em over a decade to get as far as they did. You're gonna need a spiderweb of pipelines all over the country. Reservation land be damned. 

But like I said. Don't let it slow ya down. It's totally a great play."
2021-06-17 14:49:35,wallstreetbets,Your arrogance is amusing. Good luck!

2021-06-17 14:26:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah in hindsight should've named the title different.

I think governement spending will increase on the industry because of biowarfare technologies increasing in power. Will biowar actually happen? Probably not."
2021-06-17 13:59:31,wallstreetbets,Yeah you don't fucking know what DD is
2021-06-17 14:02:21,wallstreetbets,"This isn't a DD on a specific company I understand that. I have done those before, but I'm talking macro economic events that could bring forward long-term growth in the companies I mentioned.

This is no specific play.

I used the creating the virus as a example."
2021-06-17 14:06:36,wallstreetbets,You seem like you've read at most a third of a wikipedia article about microbiology and are jumping to conclusions.
2021-06-17 14:06:39,wallstreetbets,There's no due diligence. These are just thoughts you had while shitting on the toilet.
2021-06-17 14:17:18,wallstreetbets,My thesis (maybe I should've put a tdlr) is governments are going to spending a lot of money on said technologies. I don't think there will be actually bio attacks between governments. I just think this will lead into a cold war scenario with nukes where they just spend a lot of money on the projection to stay ahead of each other.
2021-06-17 14:31:01,wallstreetbets,"You can also buy puts if you're not approved for spreads or do not have collateral for the strike width.

2021-06-17 14:31:12,wallstreetbets,I don't understand any of that. I just buy calls on shit that I see is about to explode and has the build-up for fast momentum. Like $AAPL today. 🦍🍌

2021-06-17 16:32:10,wallstreetbets,There's considerable risk if your lower call gets assigned and the stock tanks in AH. You might lose a ton of money. I recommend closing options before expire if you're not 100% you want to hold those shares.

2021-06-17 13:37:57,wallstreetbets,I think it may be too late. If someone was going to invest they should have done so in March of 2020 for the long play when we exited the pandemic. Their stock price has already gone up in anticipation of the traveling that is going on. Do you think they will continue to go up?

2021-06-17 14:08:40,wallstreetbets,Some great DD. Only thing is a good bit of the corn belt is irrigated so drought isn’t as much of a problem. $VMI Would be a good play during drought season because they make Valley pivot irrigators but looks like that stock in free fall right now. $CORN is also an etf that you have to file a K form for taxes and you won’t get it till about the first of May.

Green Mountain is damn near a creek.  Lake Mead and Powell are in pitiful shape - granted that water is all going to Southern California.

All of that is driven by low snowpack.  We’re closed out the year at 70% of average.  Most of the snow fell to the East this season.  

Yeah I don’t doubt these rivers were significantly larger before all of the pipeline were built to take water to the front range.

Now this week is June monthly expo & Quad witching. They have lots of option risk to manage this week. But next week when that’s in the rear view, I suspect many shorts will get out of the way & let the chart move to the next natural target, $15. Super bullish on the fundamentals long term, bullish short term momentum is just the cherry on top"

2021-06-17 14:24:09,wallstreetbets,hahahaha thats a great one
2021-06-17 16:03:25,wallstreetbets,How are they able to “hold this down”? Isn’t it simple supply and demand and volume and sentiment suggest lots of demand
2021-06-17 14:08:56,wallstreetbets,"While you go to the moon, can you drop by the liquor store?"
2021-06-17 13:37:54,wallstreetbets,Cause I want lambos. Plural. ;).

2021-06-17 15:57:15,wallstreetbets,It wont.
2021-06-17 16:12:10,wallstreetbets,"This guy asking the real questions.

I use my margins to write OTM puts. Robinhood doesn’t charge interest if you use cash as collateral so it’s just free money.  Until I get exercised…that is.  If I get exercised I will likely write calls.  This is dubbed as retard margin wheel strategy on RH."
2021-06-17 17:16:19,wallstreetbets,"If I buy a lambo, there’s about a 100% chance the value of it goes down.

With this play, it’s about a coin flip ;).  Infinite gain potential."

2021-06-17 14:25:32,wallstreetbets,"Just saved a lot since I started my software engineering job 5 years ago :).

2021-06-17 16:05:56,wallstreetbets,"Also market makers can influence the market in ways I can’t explain, but others can"
2021-06-17 18:22:48,wallstreetbets,They're shorting big time trying to get options out of the money so they dont have to buy shares for those that choose to exercise. Which would be a lot if 11c get in tommorow. [https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks](https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks) 23k volume just today. 11c have been in the top 10 most traded options all week. If the 12.50c get in. Wish will probably open at 15+ on monday.
2021-06-17 16:31:10,wallstreetbets,They borrow shares and sell them driving the price down with the agreement to return borrowed shares at a later date. Easy method to drive down price short term. Every time wish started moving up today massive share dumps happened to keep it down
2021-06-17 16:05:12,wallstreetbets,Big money that moves the market has their tentacles everywhere. They can just short or sell. It’s done mostly by algo. No +50 sma today close. I expect another big move next week
2021-06-17 14:10:57,wallstreetbets,You want some banana booze?

2021-06-17 17:15:46,wallstreetbets,"All right, I am in MX so my income is not as good as you, for example, 275K is more money that I will see in my life. I am going in with couple of Benajmis"

2021-06-17 15:25:33,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I guess. I’m just honestly surprised that anyone would spend this kind of cash, if it’s legit, on a silly bet when it’s been proven with much DD that amc and gme are the best plays. 

To each their own I guess. May the tendies be ever in your favor."
2021-06-17 13:36:29,wallstreetbets,Never good to have an empty bag $$$$wish.
2021-06-17 13:31:06,wallstreetbets,We all see it.
2021-06-17 13:32:25,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I could definitely buy GME shares for $200+/share and possibly hold your bag. That makes much more senses, right?"

2021-06-17 13:39:28,wallstreetbets,Best of luck my friend!!! :)

2021-06-17 15:46:49,wallstreetbets,all hail the retards supreme
2021-06-17 13:36:38,wallstreetbets,People just need a reality pill that not everyone has their parents slush funds to be able to afford GME share that is $200+ per share and possibly holding someone else bag. $WISH has more room to grow at this price point.
2021-06-17 13:35:19,wallstreetbets,"Your account is 4 years old, but you started shilling wish 8 days ago. Weird"
2021-06-17 15:58:14,wallstreetbets,What’s not going to happen?
2021-06-17 13:42:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I agree, I sold all I had and threw it in WISH because it's exciting and I can actually afford enough for it to matter.

Call me the smoothest smooth brain, but I think GME and AMC have already shot their loads. I could really use a WISH right now."
2021-06-17 13:54:50,wallstreetbets,People just need a reality pill that not everyone has their parents slush funds to be able to buy WISH just so the price C4N ST4Y AB0V3 $11 hurr durrrrr. Like Jesus christ the amount of bagholders on here crying for people to buy the stock they fomo'd into and are now bagholdwrs needing rescue is incredible.  OP here just wants people to bail him out so he can sell for a profit and leave these newbies bagholding like he was. They're shit people.  Beyond retarded.
2021-06-17 13:41:32,wallstreetbets,So you are saying that I am not allowed to invest on my first stock without anyone permission so I won't be called shilling? Go get a life people...
2021-06-17 15:59:08,wallstreetbets,Profits.  Profits wont happen with the WISH stock
2021-06-17 13:46:39,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, smart move! People need to wake up and move on, some trains already left the station..."
2021-06-17 16:36:25,wallstreetbets,"What you've said here applies to every stock being promoted on this subreddit, from GME to TSLA and whatever else."
2021-06-17 13:45:08,wallstreetbets,"""Just wondering whether AMAZON will approach WISH again to buy the company   
since the income client base for wish is slightly different than AMAZON,  
 WISH is catered to more lower income household and there are plenty of   
those in the world. If AMAZON would want to be greedier that it already   
is to capture lower/bottom income household on e-commerce and WISH   
agreed to it this time (WISH rejected it on 2015 if I'm not mistaken)   
boom! whoever hold the stock or buy the stock now it's going to be an   
instant millionaire when it happened. It's a theory but guess what,   
nothing is impossible and a giant e-commerce business looking to buy   
smaller company to capture more market is highly unusual. Spread this   
idea until it gets to Jeff Bezos' ears again for the second time!""

2021-06-17 15:38:38,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure he stopped posting ( which he hasnt) because he has became a celebrity in the gme world and could get charged with manipulation if he continues to post about it . His financial adviser advised him to not give financial advice.
2021-06-17 14:47:25,wallstreetbets,you're stupid dfv is long on GME
2021-06-17 15:53:30,wallstreetbets,"Ah okay, yeah that would make sense.

How come financial advisors don't get in trouble for stock manipulation?? Haha"

2021-06-17 16:02:07,wallstreetbets,"Because there ""smart money "" = they know better than you/us =""dumb money""

Dumb money means not on the inside dont know what plays there plotting .

The difference now is we are doing more than bitching about .

Nothing released has been bad news. Tell me which news is bad. Then compare the bad news to Tesla around this time of their development. Then consider that $RIDE has the backing and cooperation of $GM. Then consider that $RIDE had less R&D to overcome to get their vehicles production ready.

Where is the bad news? Go ahead, quote “preorders” as if that isn’t a straw argument. Tesla used it. Ford is now using it.

Tell me Burns left. So?

Tell me they need more cash. Is this serious? Rivian constantly needs “more cash” no one bats an eye. At least $RIDE has a great shot at ATVM loan, and other financing.

Tell me HuB MoToRS and I’ll ask what’s your fear of technology?

Tell me Baja and I’ll point to the last Zoom conference where a strategic partner asked LMC to test in the extreme conditions and are happy with the results. Then I’ll ask who the fuck else besides the military needs a truck to operate at this extreme condition. Then I’ll ask you why aren’t you bullish when this strategic partner was happy with the results.

Tell me “going concern” bad and I’ll ask why do you have difficulty understanding auditing language? It’s common. It was used with Tesla.

2021-06-17 19:59:06,wallstreetbets,"Just noticed. Happy cake day.

The wording of “firm orders” isn’t wrong or misleading. Everyone needs to stop fooling themselves with the preorder argument. You can’t sell a product until it passes certification.

Just ask Ford. They’re reporting 100,000 preorders, too. But they’re non-binding, too. So why is it a negative for $RIDE but a positive for $F? Don’t tell me it wasn’t a positive. 

So the CFO wasn’t experienced. Well, they’re bringing on experienced leadership. This happens.

Take a step back, compare the standards applied to $RIDE and any other manufacturer. Notice they differ. Why? Fisher announces they won’t manufacture cars until 2022. Because someone else is making it for them, this is good?

Ok.

Lucid announces it’ll make 500 cars instead of whatever.m number they advertised. Lucid is still a darling, but $RIDE is a scam. Makes sense.

I already addressed Ford’s non-binding preorders. From them, that’s great. Even with $30 billion in debt, Ford is the future. But $RIDE with no debt is a scam. Ok."

But you can still compare them."
2021-06-17 17:35:46,wallstreetbets,"It's the same concept, you can have a binding agreement to purchase before the product is ready.

Other difference is for a long time Lordstown didn't even require any form of deposit, and paid marketing companies to make pre orders to create inflated sense of value.  

Ford, GM, and Tesla aren't using pre orders as justification for their valuation.  Fisker is overvalued as well as they are over a year out, but at least they have a pile of cash to sit on."

2021-06-17 18:39:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, except the price tag on a 787 and a Cybertruck are a bit different, as is the level of commitment and binding agreement. 

The auto manufacturers are using the preorders to gauge interest. And they're all publishing the numbers for the exact same reason, to stoke interest. 

It's on the investor which numbers to include in their valuation. We all place our own bets. 

FYI: All marketing and sales teams are paid to generate orders. Like every salesman ever."

2021-06-17 12:42:51,wallstreetbets,mexico?
2021-06-17 13:27:00,wallstreetbets,Agreed!
2021-06-17 14:49:00,wallstreetbets,"Because it's getting absolutely crushed by regulators from SK and USA.

I've got December 22.5s (virtually illiquid, not sure how I got mine lol). I also had weeklies for 25 that got devastated by the regulatory pause."
2021-06-17 13:37:33,wallstreetbets,"I agree. The delay from the federal side doesn't actual do anything to the captured value of the stock, just temporarily causes a dip."
2021-06-17 12:48:56,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! Yeah, I'm super positive on the long-term price action for this one."
2021-06-17 14:44:31,wallstreetbets,"I do think that if the current 2 buyout deals don't go through, the most likely future buyers would be either a US company or a Korean company."
2021-06-17 14:50:06,wallstreetbets,That's because there's literally zero chance they'll hit you moron.
2021-06-17 15:55:17,wallstreetbets,"The worst part is, if the CFIUS review had waited until next week, MX might have legitimately gamma squeezed on the fucking huge number of 6/18 25c"
2021-06-17 13:35:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that seemed to be one of the primary points of concern in many of the shareholder litigation suits. However, it seems like neither shareholders nor regulators have any intention of letting the company be sold too easily."
2021-06-17 14:51:23,wallstreetbets,"Do you think that the value will hold? I've been long on MX for a while and my *hope* is that with 2 competing buyouts well above current price, they'll see a long trend upwards regardless of if the current mergers fail.... But that doesn't seem to be the case based on the most recent dip?"
2021-06-17 14:51:18,wallstreetbets,Are you literally retarded? Read the dd you fucking dumbass
2021-06-17 14:55:50,wallstreetbets,"If both of the current buyouts are denied, I expect the price to dip and stabilize at a lower value for at least a week or two until the market wakes the fuck up and realizes it didn't mean anything in the long run. Then I expect we'll see a near linear recovery and then growth into the $30s range."
2021-06-17 14:53:45,wallstreetbets,"Right the deal is for $35/share... So if you're buying 35c AND **paying any option premiums at all** your breakeven price is going to be 35+Premium... At buyout, you will receive $35/share, leaving you bagholding the premium, even if it's $1/100 you're still guaranteed to lose money based on current conditions."
2021-06-17 14:58:29,wallstreetbets,"The premium for these contracts arent even worth mentioning with the iv so low. Your also saying $35 is the ceiling, which is fucking retarded. If it even comes close to $35 within the next 6 months, which im assuming it will since theres multiple fucking buyout offers, then ill have made money. Hope that created a few wrinkles in that smooth brain of yours"
2021-06-17 15:03:12,wallstreetbets,"So you're basically betting that it'll go above the current second buyout offer, when one is already suffering regulatory issues, and the other was an unsolicited offer that has yet to be recommended by management, and calls are cheap since 35 is already a 40% premium on the current price. Yeah I considered that so no you're not adding any wrinkles, I just disagree with your bet.  GL though, I'd love for MX to approach or surpass 35."
2021-06-17 15:07:41,wallstreetbets,Lmao I dont know what your basing your prices off of but do you even know what the premium value consists of? Your paying for extra time on these option contracts so theta doesnt eat it alive betting on weeklies like you probably do.
2021-06-17 15:13:49,wallstreetbets,"40% premium on the share price from the buyout offer... 23->35... Miscalculated it's actually just over 50% after the dip, the offer was made when MX was closer to $25, which is closer to 40% premium.

I'm saying I disagree with your bet that it will approach and surpass 35, to the extent that 35C will be significantly profitable over its current premium. I'm specifically saying that you'll simply theta decay at best to the 35 PT."
2021-06-17 15:18:35,wallstreetbets,"If you could accurately predict the caps of every stock, im sure hedge funds would pay good money for that. Your not taking anything else into account, and assuming that the stock will cap out at $35. But have you even considered why theres buyout offers coming? Why theres new regulations being put in place in SK? Why theres multiple lawsuits against the company for undervaluing their own stock? Did you even read the litigation claims or are you basing this solely off your unparalleled ability to predict the stock price?"
2021-06-17 15:23:58,wallstreetbets,"The litigation claims are absolutely boilerplate claims by the same law firms that Sue every single other firm on flimsy grounds trying to get massive paydays and pennies for shareholders. Analyst estimates don't exceed these numbers, even if the $29/share offer might be low.

Yes, I'm aware of the factors and **I respect that you choose to make that bet based on your read of the situation.** But personally I really don't think it'll shoot to those values.

Okay, fine, maybe ""literally zero chance"" is technically an overstatement, but yes I stand by my analysis that I would not value MX over 35 by 1/2022."
2021-06-17 12:20:41,wallstreetbets,"Oof. It may dip tomorrow since it’s Friday, but good luck! I am personally looking for an increase"
2021-06-17 12:22:10,wallstreetbets,Oof. Bareback indeed.
2021-06-17 12:31:17,wallstreetbets,What does this mean exactly? I’m new to stocks

2021-06-17 12:46:55,wallstreetbets,What to this sub was built on puts. Money is money just because the last two years has been meteoric rise. Be around here when the market is soft or we hit recession you will see the mixed bag that is normally around of calls and puts

2021-06-17 12:39:11,wallstreetbets,"Options have a theta premium that is higher the closer you are to the exp date. The spread here basically avoids theta decay. It’s a straight bet predicting it’ll be at $56 or under at expiration. Anything above the breakeven, the position expires worthless."

The TA for TWNK 50MA shows 15.53 and the stock is at 16.33$ even the 20MA @16.10$ is following the stock price very closely which is what its supposed to do. Whereas PRPL has a 6$ gap from its 50MA and a 3$ gap from its 20MA which means share price are below its MA’s which shows a possible gap-fill to those levels or a ‘bounce’.

This happens all the time in defense contracting. They can justify it on the basis of supporting the EV industry.

Total BS and complete pork, but this kind of thing happens all the time.

Say USPS orders 100k trucks: that's 10k/year

Say $WKHS gets $7500 for the parts they deliver and has 20% margins on them (this is a gov jobs program). That's $1.5k per truck or $15m/year. Not enough to justify anywhere close to this valuation on cashflow alone, but enough to not die and create a glimmer of hope in the future which might cause a pop. If that pop causes mass short covering, you can forget about intrinsic valuations."

Tesla's would be about the most pragmatic solution currently.  Most companies can't source the batteries required.  I get tons of demands to move our very large bus fleet to all electric... Can't, it gets cold and range drops to around 80miles.  To hot and AC requires an onboard generator.  

The delivery vehicle they are offering is maxed at 160 miles in ""urban"" conditions

DeJoy doesn’t have to listen to Congress if he doesn’t want to. He has shown before that he would rather hurt the postal service than listen to anyone else. Oshkosh is already a government contractor as they supply vehicles to our military. Finally the USPS needs some 150k vehicles and WKHS has never produced a single fleet of vehicles over 100. That guy who mentions UPS above while is technically correct is actually a bad thing since [UPS](https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-electric-delivery-vehicles-factbox-idINKBN2601HE) appears to have opted to not to receive the last 950 trucks after receiving the 1st 50 as they have now been placing large orders with [Arrival](https://www.fleetowner.com/news/article/21121715/ups-takes-stake-in-evmaker-arrival-will-buy-at-least-10000-electric-delivery-vans) and have made no mention of WKHS since the end of 2018. If you are going to put up a bunch of news about the bull case you need to include the bear case. IMO there is no chance WKHS gets the USPS contract.

BMS systems, cooling systems for the batteries, electronic components , suspension etc

Better then ICE absolutely, but do you recall iPhone and Droid phones having updates that squashed their battery life?   

Congress has it wrong really and what the market can make and has in offer doesn't fit what congress wants, it just isn't ready yet and throwing money at it will be a disaster

Really the best bet would be 100 mile range batteries made from Lith iron Batts and an onboard generator that can simultaneously charge the batteries for longer routes.  The efficiencies are huge improvements as the engine runs at peak efficiency all the time when running.  Lith iron batteries last 10x as long as Tesla's but have 60% of the storage capacity.  However they can be charged and discharge at the same time without thermal runaway.  Really the hybrids would be the best bet.  Almost all driving commutes are under 100 miles a day, and if you need to go further... No issue.  Can't find a charger just yet... No issue

But we aren't there yet infastructure, battery or manufacturer yet

If anything USPS should buy model 3s, or hell model Ys from Tesla no one else has a current product that gets close to competitive"

It's not just the vehicles.  If you are going to charge 100s of cars and trucks at the same time each night you need massive elctrical upgrades to your buildings and yards, massive.  Each vehicle would need at least 100 amps of overhead... 100s to thousands of vehicles .. it would be years before the facilities are ready to support it

If a squeeze is your only play, holy shit you’re dumb as shit. Nobody gives a shit about workhorse because it’s a shitty company, which means that retail won’t control the entire float, and without anybody to control the float, you don’t get a squeeze.

I'm sure many of you have noticed (or maybe you haven't) that almost all banks residing/operating within the U.S. have been taking some heavy hits these past 6 months from a chart standpoint. Sure from a yearly standpoint they're absolutely killing it, most US banks are up $5, $12, even $20 and most Q1's of this year for most US banks were some of the best quarterlys they've posted in decades, but from my point of view this all seems to be tapering off and this excess success seen in the past year seems to be (and maybe obviously) driven by the pandemic and the abnormal year we had during 2020.

From a 3 month perspective a lot of these gains are still positive but they're like a 1/3rd of what the yearly gains were and for some banks (mostly smaller ones like: First-midwest, Citigroup, Fifth Third Bank] the positive gains and momentum they were having have started turning negative by like $2, $3, $5+ in some cases and others are just breaking even by the cent and to me it seems like the small banks are bleeding out a little faster than the bigger guys, but I suspect the big banks to follow suit due to a lot of monthly and now weekly gains for almost all banks are turning negative as well by again $2, $3+. 

I've personally been following U.S. Bank (USB) the most because I personally Bank with these guys and have been seeing some odd discrepancies on an internal side that don't necessarily match with what they're saying on a public/more formal side. I reside in Iowa and U.S. Bank has been closing down a lot of their branches over here and I've received emails from U.S. Bank stating that the company is going through various changes and restructuring at the moment and that they'd like to have a financial meeting with me to discuss the nature of these changes to assure me that U.S. Bank still has a bright future. U.S. Bank will probably post a good Q2 this July, its going to be higher than their Q2 last year but it's going to be much lower than their Q1 of this year, analysts estimate Q2 of this year to be around .45 cents whilst Q1 of this year was upwards of a $1, I just personally feel like Q3 of this year will be lower than Q2, am I wrong in my thinking/line of logic and understanding here?

All I wanna know is this; is it a good time to start shorting Banks, does the evidence and mania in the market and possible bubble speculation warrant a closer look into shorting these guys? Am I just crazy? 

I'll take any advice or criticism given, just be gentle please"
2021-06-17 12:11:07,wallstreetbets,"I mean, with people doing a lot of their shit online, not really a need to have so many branches. I work for a bank and whenever I go into our branches, they are mostly dead. Why keep them open if people aren’t using them."
2021-06-17 12:14:24,wallstreetbets,I would literally do the exact opposite due to the ridiculous inflation going on. But shit Citi is killing me today.
2021-06-17 12:02:20,wallstreetbets,Banks are having restrictions on raising dividends and buybacks lifted.   I doubt now is the time to be shorting.
2021-06-17 12:13:28,wallstreetbets,Pretty convincing...just bought some Jan 21 $45 puts.
2021-06-17 12:27:09,wallstreetbets,"A lot of the earnings for banks lately is in their investment banking divisions, riding the stock market inflation up.

I’d be more comfortable with buying bank stocks right now that show growth in retail banking and lending. I bought a large long position in Ally earlier in the year. Don’t know where US bank falls here, but I personally took out long put positions in XLF yesterday."
2021-06-17 14:27:28,wallstreetbets,"I bank at Wells Fargo and everytime I've gone there recently there is 10 people in line and only one bank teller.

It makes no sense because even during covid they had 3 tellers and there was never a line.

When I asked the teller about it she was very dodgy and aggressive even though I asked with a very nice tone and assured her it has nothing to do with waiting- that I was just curious.

She seemed very suspicious and like she was unable to actually talk about it. Although I could be just reading into it.

Add that to Warren Buffet unloading his entire 17 year position in Wells Fargo last month.

Add that to Reverse repo market explosion

Add that to them overdrafting my account yesterday

I finally said that's the last straw and bought Puts with the money I made them give me back.

I may even increase this position a bit. It seems like there's some funky business going on with the banks. Deep out of the money Puts are pretty cheap too, so I'm willing to gamble a bit."
2021-06-17 12:42:05,wallstreetbets,Citigroup is a small bank to you?? Lol what do you call FCF or ISBC? Super-tiny-micro?
2021-06-17 14:10:42,wallstreetbets,Aye I’m all in on SoFi which is kind of a counter bank play (I understand it’s a bank but still)
2021-06-17 12:06:55,wallstreetbets,"these restrictions end June 30th yes? So are you saying that once restrictions end that then they'll be increasing dividends which would warrant interest in the company and buybacks of shares, bonds, etc would allow them to raise more revenue via the buybacks?

this is assuming the various banks* have also passed their mandatory capital stress test too right?"
2021-06-17 12:44:19,wallstreetbets,"I got ALLY last year too, only bought 10 shares because we were just getting out of the very bottom of the hole but damn dude wish I put it all on them and PYPL and not a chunk"
2021-06-17 12:44:46,wallstreetbets,very new to this still so my understanding is certainly flawed
2021-06-17 12:13:04,wallstreetbets,"Buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares. That would be bullish for share price, not bearish.  And, of course, raising dividends will attract more interest from a certain segment of investors. Also bullish, not bearish."
2021-06-17 12:42:57,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, not sure but I think OP is confusing some of these events and actions."

 Couple of points- 

* Last year we seen success with Tesla and Apple Stock Split, go do the research
* Stock splits are excellent trading opportunities for swing traders, except for reverse splits.

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Lion Electric (LEV) Discussion Lion Electric (LEV) has a simple business model: they make electric school buses for the public in an attempt to remove the dependency on fossil fuels.

Currently, 7 models have been produced, which includes school buses, public transport, garbage trucks, Class 8s, semis, and bucket trucks.

The Lion8 was released in 2018 and is a zero emission vehicle that boasts transport of over 70 students for a max range of 250 miles on a single charge. 

Wall Street analysts have issued ratings and price targets for The Lion Electric in the last 12 months. Their average twelve-month price target is $21.67, predicting that the stock has a possible upside of 15.25%. The high price target for LEV is $26.00 and the low price target for LEV is $20.00.

2021-06-17 18:08:35,wallstreetbets,It's a good thing because he gets x number of contracts \* 100 shares for the $40 price. And AMC is currently trading over $60.
2021-06-17 18:29:08,wallstreetbets,"It wouldn't have mattered, I would be paying 41.13 for a breakeven price regardless unless Iet my exchange do it and give me the profit. This way, I wasn't taxed twice around by taking profit early and didn't want RH to do it for me and give me the scraps. It turns out I wanted the stocks anyways. If Iwould have taken the 130 to 150k profit, I woudl have been taxed 42%, then turn around and put in all that again for more stocks that I would have ended up selling again and getting taxed another round of 42%. This way, I converted over to stocks instead and now I have one point of exit for getting capital gained taxed to the max."

No. You can buy a $10 strike call if you want to. Granted, they will be more expensive."

Hell, who would do it for $500, or even $50? Without shorts to squeeze, what are shares _actually_ worth?
My bearish puts purchased at the previous top a few weeks ago probably expire worthless tomorrow, demonstrating that my above thesis was wrong, so I’m genuinely curious what I’m missing."

Firstly lets address the the float and IPO:

""ContextLogic's (NASDAQ:WISH) lock-up period is set to expire on Monday, June 14th. ContextLogic had issued 46,000,000 shares in its IPO on December 16th. The total size of the offering was $1,104,000,000 based on an initial share price of $24.00. Shares of the company owned by major shareholders and company insiders will be eligible for trade following the expiration of the lock-up period.""

WISH closed at $9.91 on the Friday before lockup ended and is now \~$11 on YUUGE volume this imo is a great sign and indicates massive accumulation by instos. I have taken the liberty of cutting the definition and key signs of accumulation below for the lower primates among us.

Now onto some DD...which im reposting from someone that actually did DD

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxluuh/wish\_undervalued\_and\_not\_a\_meme\_stock/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxluuh/wish_undervalued_and_not_a_meme_stock/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Next revenue, solid solid YoY growth +50% every year but one.

\-Lets talk industry; ecommerce this is in a secular bull since forever and has only been accelerated by COVID.   
\- We have a new head of the FTC with an antitrust hard-on for Amazon etc, you know what that means? Opportunity, opportunity for a plucky little upstart with no debt and a bunch of cash to grab some crumbs off the table.   
\- Amazon MC is $1.6T, now WISH will never compete at any level on its own, but with the long dick of Uncle Sam at the FTC jizzing in Bezos' coffee there is a chance to grab some market share in the budget catagories.

\- Think about this if you were holding Amazon shares and want to diversify in the same space...a 1% transfer of MC from Amazon to WISH is...$16B (current $6.5B)  


Finally technicals we are cruising along the 50dma after a big drop from the IPO and have broken out of a giant declining wedge - Technical target from this is \~$20 however it will most likely overshoot to $30 minimum due to all the hype. Volume is up massively which is a great sign, look for a couple of solid closes over the 50dma for it to take off next week especially once everyone stops hyperventilating over the Fed meeting yesterday; The J-Pow printer is here to stay he will hand this shit box (the economy/stock market propped up on perpetual money printing) to the next fed chair to deal with after he was publicly brutalised by Trump for tightening in 2018. He knows his place, its in the printer room, next to the printer with a spare ink cartridge in his hand.

TLDR; WISH stonk is a good stonk.  


Also protip the way OTM calls are ridiculously expensive right now so you should prob run a vertical spread.

P.S. Look at the high quality products they are selling

2021-06-17 12:50:57,wallstreetbets,"How is the end of the lock up period a good thing?

A wedge breakout means nothing if the stock is getting pumped as aggressively as wish is right now.

You talk about a squeeze ... In fact you talk about this stock being the only one where you actually believe in it squeezing, yet you mention neither short interest, nor call options. What is supposed to squeeze here, especially with locked up shares soon getting freed up?

looking at your profile, I don't think you're a shill, but that doesn't mean you're right.
Wish is a china-trash peddling service, basically reselling cheap products from AliExpress/Alibaba at a premium with abysmal customer service and a tendency scamming their own customers. 
With Chinese products making their way onto more mainstream market places and at the same time westerners embracing Chinese marketplaces like AliExpress, I understand how the stock has been in a downward wedge pattern for the longest time.

Given all of that, I haven't yet seen a single reason that justifies wish being WSB' hottest play right now. Given how susceptible WSB has become to shills and large scale pump and dumps, you have to ask yourself if you're not getting lead on here."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UPSTART Rocket departing soon You might never have heard about **Upstart**, (Nasdaq: UPST) at least so far, but this is a company that is bringing a much needed innovation into something useful for lots of people, if not all: access to credit. 

At present, the traditional way to access credit takes into account several factors, when determining whenever the credit will be released or not.  


These criteria are generally very inefficient for many borrower’s cause it fails into determining the true risk of borrowing and likelyhood of defaulting. 

In reality there is a lot of room for improving the way banks to determine the true risk level of a borrowers, and here’s exactly when Upstart kicks in.

They are aiming to disrupt the industry by giving banks better and more reliable data to determine the true borrower’s risk, so to increase and extend people’s access to credit.

**Upstart** platform is AI-powered and helps to connect consumers with banks, using nearly 15 billion cells of data to determine the true risk of a borrower.

Such a company couldn’t be founded by average guys also. David Girouard and Anna Counselman are both former Google executives. Paul Gu, Upstart’s third co-founder and a visionary for some of the company predictive models, also has a comprehensive background in risk analysis.

They are all still involved in the company owning around 17% stake in Upstart.

Now here are some facts:

* *Upstart has enojyed great growth in 2020*
* *Revenue have increased 42% YoY*
* *300.000+ loans originated from the platform*
* *Upstart has become PROFITABLE in 2020 reporting income of $6 million, over a net loss of 0.5$ the year prior*

Nevertheless, **Upstart has a huge room to grow**, since it is estimated that it makes less than 5% of the 92 billion U.S. Market for unsecured personal loans.

Now what happens? It is also currently one of the most shorted stock on the Nasdaq. **Short interest is around 12,6% of Upstart’s float**, and shorts are down 586$ million YTD already in mark-to-market losses.  
 

**The stock is not only on track for a short squeeze**, but the great thing is, it is actually a great profitable company.  


Ofc all the above are my personal opinion, however I like the stock."
2021-06-17 12:18:20,wallstreetbets,You forgot to mention it is down from high of $170.
2021-06-17 12:21:07,wallstreetbets,"P/E is over 700. Maybe a company with a bright future but that shit is crazy. Market cap over 9B for a company with just over a quarter million in revenue.

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLNE: The Push to 6/18 and the Future # TL;DR - The push to 6/18 and beyond is still on, and you retards are going to be a part of it. CLNE is a fart mine of untapped potential with mega partnerships, positive rumors, and fundamentals.

Hello again fellow cow fart enthusiasts,

Wake the fuck up - it's show time.

CLNE continues to be a major player here on reddit and across the media landscape. The news is talking about it, we're talking about it, everyone is talking about it. The company is positively positioned to take over a major market in renewable fuels for heavy transportation as per the many dozens of posts that have been produced. The long play has never changed, this is a growth stock that will grow - and we've been giving it a shot of life helping accelerate those plans. 

**Let's take a look at where we stand for the 6/18 call walls:**

https://preview.redd.it/twcac5brbu571.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3bd9b60b4e9c5472643d14a23e7858367c47f5f

**Not even considering the retards at $16 strikes and beyond....**

**- 1.2 million shares of open interest at $10**

**- 1.3 million shares of open interest at $11**

**- 2.2 million shares of open interest at $12**

**- 4 million shares of open interest at $13**

# Likewise, the assault on cow farts has continued daily:

https://preview.redd.it/bpy8oe79cu571.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0e21b7e73a9ac5a49472d7164a4651ef4c24c6

# Recent rumors, unconfirmed:

* Per a power user on here, a deal with UPS in the works/nearing completion
* CEO to appear on Mad Money
* Upcoming presser

These are the things that have come up in the last day or two. The company is aware and actively working to improve their image in the face of new interest. They rebranded this week and updated their entire customer/public-facing image. The CEO tweeted what basically amounts to a meme, featuring Sinatra's ""Fly Me to the Moon."" I'm loving the engagement.

**One thing I can say is that an absolute whale of a Chad has been buying shares today and unusual options activity alerts have been pinging this morning.**

# I'm not going to beat a dead horse/cow here...

...you all know the drill. This is a great stock and, as I originally said 2 weeks ago, the benefits of owning it go well beyond this expiration date. I'm still long on this one and will continue to be until the thesis changes. I'm still loving the short play. This is not financial advice, do you own DD.

  
See you on the moon.

Cheers"

Today we saw a random burst of buy activity that shot us up about 8-10% before we settled back into the normal transaction pattern. My opinion is that the big buyers such as institutions and whales are testing the waters for how hard it is to spike this stock. It went up very easily with only moderate buying. As long as we don't paper hand out early tomorrow, we will be good to go on the squeeze."

It is most definitely not irrelevant.  Friday alone matters, but going into Friday at $13 would've been the nail in the coffin.  Now it's frankly extremely unlikely we see the $13C wall get activated.  At this point your options are basically worthless anyway so hold and hope, but at least be realistic with the chances."

Stock sold off when they announced the acquisition of SLACK, but Salesforce has been incredible at integrating acquisitions. Look at Mulesoft.

Salesforce's acquisition of Mulesoft for $6.5B 3 years ago (May '18) was such a massive steal, and great strategic move.  In Q1 Salesforce announced Mulesoft contributed $380M in rev, growing 49% YoY. What would that business be worth today? $40B? $50B?

The market is recognizing that CRM is incredible at making acquisitions pay, and we're going back to all time highs soon. Long 50 shares and $250c for 2021. Still down 14% from its 52 week high and  we're slowly heading back there."

Overpriced trash that you wind up needing to hire people to manage properly. HubSpot's CRM-only offering is like 1/5th the price and has way better usability at any scale.

But yeah, they're really good at buying companies that are better than their core software. Slack is a really strong buy for them, and I don't get why it triggered a sell-off, even though Slack's new logo is clearly a swastika (look at it. Really look at the logo).

&#x200B;

I try not to fall in love with a stock but Lion Electric (LEV) is one that I think is such a solid stock right now, especially at this price. I post pretty regularly in the daily about it but usually get shot down instantly as a bot or spammer which I think is really weird. I just think it’s a great play and has no many catalysts and upside for both long hold and options. I’m not going to pump and dump, I’m in it for the long haul but will play some call options along the way. I currently have 1050 shares which include regular shares and warrants. The warrants can be converted one to one for shares by 2026 at a set price of $11.50. I also have Oct. calls at $30, and will be adding more shares and options on dips. Here is my Schwab account but I also have a TD Ameritrade account with 250 shares and the Oct options.

&#x200B;

The stock has been a sleeper here in WSB, guess it’s not a short squeeze or high volatility but the upside is tremendous and opportunity to moon is high.  The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Lion Electric Co have a median target of 22.00, with a high estimate of 26.00 and a low estimate of 20.00. The median estimate represents a +20.02% increase from the last price of 18.33.

&#x200B;

They currently have manufacturing facilities in Montreal, Canada and Sacramento, California and building another major plant, biggest commercial EV plant in the U.S. in Joliet Illinois. Also just broke ground on a battery manufacturing facility also near Montreal. Both will be producing mid to late 2022. Below is their school bus and at the top of the post their Lion6 Amazon truck.

Parts from an article on the company from montrealintechnology

Lion Electric will produce a giant order for Amazon for up to 2,500 all-electric Lion 6 and Lion 8 trucks by 2025. Amazon has the option to purchase upwards of 19.98 percent of the company through shares and warrants, if they purchase $1.1 billion worth of products.

Lion Electric will also provide maintenance and training for Amazon.

Lion Electric is required to reserve a portion of its manufacturing capacity for up to 500 trucks per year from 2021 to 2025. The deal calls for Lion Electric to provide the greater of 500 trucks per year of 10 percent of manufacturing capacity from 2026 to 2030, notes [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northern-genesis-spac-rallies-lion-162015419.html).

The framework agreement with Amazon wrapped up in July 2020,  but was hidden in a long stock exchange notice. Amazon Logistics is listed as the specified customer in the SEC filing.

In the filing, the company revealed that it had 300 purchase orders for up to 6,000 vehicles at the time of its SPAC merger announcement. The company predicts 2021 revenue hitting $204 million from 650 units sold. **In 2023, revenue is expected to jump to $1.67 billion from 7,580 units sold.**

**How did Lion Electric meet Amazon?**

Bedard, the company’s CEO, was a guest speaker at an event in the trucking industry. There he met the folks at Amazon, which started a relationship that lead us to today. After the event, Bedard invited Amazon to come to Quebec to see Lion’s trucks.

“They tested and audited the truck, I imagine they liked it, they made a master agreement with us and we’re all really excited about this.”

I’m excited too, feels like a “can’t go tits up” kinda stock but do your own DD and come to your own conclusions. I plan to keep adding and feel pretty secure doing so. If it moons great, if it goes steadily up and doubles in price, that’s cool, if Amazon goes all in and it frickin rockets out of the atmosphere…then yeah, I will say I told ya so.

2021-06-17 14:59:43,wallstreetbets,What platform do you use? Robinhood and Fidelity don’t have them. I bought on TDA under LEV+ and Schwab LEV/WS.  Just search LEV and other options should populate.

2021-06-17 12:21:46,wallstreetbets,"I work for another mattress company that is near a purple store.

I've shopped them. 

Their reps all lay on the beds with their phones out and literally don't give two shits about whether people purchase(They make no comission so no surprise). 

They weren't even on our list of 'top competitors' anymore this year. Management seems to think Casper is going to take the cheap mattress market and is now the bigger direct threat.

Moreover, laying on their beds literally feels like I'm laying on a bed of soft mushy legos. Their 'fuming' problems are so well known that I get questions about it every day about our mattresses despite Purple really being the only product with that issue. They're horrible. Pillows are nice though.

Wouldn't bet on a lot of growth from them tbh. Now if I were investing in this segment. I would put my risky play money on Casper. Literally has the largest market share and is unlikely to lose that simply because they found their niche in the cheap bed market. Not a financial advisor tho."
2021-06-17 16:50:46,wallstreetbets,They killed someone in their main plant a month ago.
2021-06-17 18:22:13,wallstreetbets,Ain't that the truth.

My biggest concern is really their sales team.

Any new company can sell on hype but without a good comp plan or a sales team that cares keeping the momentum going is going to be rough."

2021-06-17 13:52:35,wallstreetbets,"Oh, you're in RIDE... makes sense."
2021-06-17 14:08:50,wallstreetbets,"How does anyone say production by Sep and 20,000 trucks before May for a company that has never gotten to production. It sounds like the most optimistic scenario where everything works right. To get to that rate of production you need to be making about 650 per week.

To compare, Tesla started production of the Model 3 in July 2017 and for Q3 2017 produced 260. For Q4 they produced 2,425, and in Q1' 2018 they hit 9,766 vehicles produced. So if you do the math the first nine months of production they produced 12,451 Model 3's. Yet, Lordstown Motor in their first 8 months will produce 20,000 Endurances? And without any spare change.

Seems a bit of a stretch to me."
2021-06-17 14:39:21,wallstreetbets,"Bro what are you smoking? The lordstown founder and CEO literally stepped down days ago. He’s been accused of fraud and failed statements. RIDE is Nikola 2.0. I give it a few weeks before they push out production a year. Canoo is out here showing their Gammas, over 500k miles tested, and Lordstown ain’t done shit - they are still on Beta. Not to mention, how is a Lordstown pick up remotely compelling? It couldn’t even make it 40 miles through the Baja. Their pickup has no product differentiation in the market. It’s a copy cat F150 and the only value in Lordstown was their ability to get to market fast. They’re going to fail doing that, Ford will beat them to the punch and Lordstown will end. EV stocks are hyped, but you need to actually do your research to find where the value is and isn’t."

And needless to say, Starbucks is *popular AF* in China, like $4.6 billion a quarter popular and revenues grew 9% in 2021 already. Oatly is getting massive exposure through Starbucks.  
  
And it makes sense - most of Asia is lactose intolerant. It's the perfect solution to a centuries-long problem. No other non-dairy milk has been this popular or promoted at Starbucks, or with anything close to the brand name recognition as Oatly. Okay here's where the supercharged growth could come in... BUBBLE TEA. A HUGE industry in China and Taiwan (approx. $3 billion), if Oatly got on a partnership deal with GongCha or ChaTime we could be seeing billions added to Oatly's revenues. Literally every cup is a milk product, it's in there own interest to embrace non-dairy options...
  
Milk is an $800 billion+ industry, the potential is massive and Oatly has such great partnerships and momentum with celebrity investors like Oprah, Natalie Portman, Jay-Z, and Howard Schultz.  
  
Also, it tastes better than regular milk, fite me. Once you drink it it's like being indoctrinated into a cult. You cannot escape it's far-reaching tendrils of deliciousness. You'll be putting that shit in everything.  
  
Also, it has 80% less environmental impact than cows milk, kids love that environmentalism shit.  
  
Btw, it has 8 analyist Buy ratings, not that anyone listens to that.  
  
Not enough data is out to do the SMELL test. Probably need to check next month!"

2021-06-17 16:39:31,wallstreetbets,What other brands are there?
2021-06-17 11:02:56,wallstreetbets,"Except their competitors are household names with massive supply chains and Luckin coffee is a shady chinese company nobody has heard of. I'm not saying I'm not bullish on OTLY, but lets not kid ourselves."
2021-06-17 11:39:56,wallstreetbets,"Zero added, still a load of sugar in it.  But people love fuckin sugar."
2021-06-17 11:04:10,wallstreetbets,But none of them will be in Starbucks. Oatly has an impenetrable moat because of Howard Schultz. It's a source of infinite brand exposure. It's not all about price.
2021-06-17 14:34:56,wallstreetbets,"It's 4/100 g sugar, I think we gonna be alright"
2021-06-17 14:39:56,wallstreetbets,"Most people don't actually look at the nutrition label anyway.  If it says no added sugar they assume it's not there.

**OpenRAN** is a telecoms standard for interoperable 5G technologies. Great technical idea, but the incumbents already have market share and have little reason to move to an open standard.

**Ceragon** is an Israeli telecoms company. (I’ve installed a number of their microwaves, it’s nice gear.) They’re making moves into the 5G space, including with OpenRAN.

**ARK** is an investment company. They have an ETF called IZRL.

**IZRL** is an ETF described as “Israel Innovative Technology ETF”. It holds shares in 59 innovative Israeli companies, with Ceragon sitting at #10 within the ETF."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Fed can NEVER raise rates, inflation is NOT transitory, and if you think otherwise you're literally retarded Here's why:

1) Paul Volker had to raise rates to 20% to stop the inflation of the 1970s. WTF is 0.75% two years from now going to do?

2) In 2008 the Fed said QE and low interest rates were temporary. Temporary means 13+ years?

3) In 2018 the Fed tried to normalize interest rates and unload their balace sheet and THEY FAILED. They couldn't even raise rates back then, before the money supply increased by 30%, before all the covid debt. 

4) If just talking about a 0.25 increase two years from now crashes the market what do you think will happen when they actually do it? It's bullshit propaganda. They will NEVER raise rates. They will choose an inflationary depression over a debt caused crash.

then Trump decided he wanted to do some market manipulation by ""talking to"" powell. when that didn't work he decided he wanted to start a trade war with China instead to force powell's hand. 

Powell didn't give two shits about Trump's plan. He was still raising rates. 

Finally covid happened, and that forced the FED to pump the brakes on rates. 

When the rate increase comes, the markets will blink again, and take a loss for a few days. consider it a good time to buy some cheap SPY."

I don't see the US having non-transitory inflation unless excess money starts to get into the lower class via wage increases. The lower and middle class would be the main drivers of inflation in my opinion."
2021-06-17 16:33:50,wallstreetbets,"Inflation will be transitory and prices will be crushed when the economy reopens and this artificial commodity squeeze goes away as factories return to full occupancy/capacity.

I hear it from contractors/builders and consultants repeatedly in the last month, that material prices are expected to drop by the end of the year. The reason why wood/metal/commodities are up so much is simply due to COVID. Factories have not been allowed to operate at more than 30% occupancy or some stupid % like that, so there's no real supply constraint. As COVID goes away and they are allowed to reopen fully the material prices will crash.

Also, China is releasing it's reserves, and it damn well has to. They cannot sustain their exports if raw material prices keep going up, so they need (and have the power) to squash inflationary pressures and they will do so.

Oil is going up because that's the damn cycle..whatever, it will settle again in a few months. 

What's going on is a bullwhip effect. Supply dried out due to COVId and the market picked up before suppliers had a chance to open up, so they are trying to catch up. This always results in suppliers overproducing and flooding the market as quickly as possible to take advantage of the high prices. The result is oversupply and prices dropping just as demand cools off, knocking things out twice.

With inflation staying low the FED cannot raise rates because it will kill off the economy, and that's why they haven't raised them all these years. The risk for USA is stagnation or deflation. Those two are hard to beat. Inflation can be controlled.

All those 'end is nigh' got it terribly wrong."

They’ve realized their mistake from last time, and this time will let inflation run hot at 5%+. This will give them the runaway they need to raise rates and end QE.

None of their decisions in this matter have anything to do with worry of a market crash. They don’t give a fuck about a market crash. They care about two things: employment and inflation, because that’s their mandate."

2021-06-17 13:38:01,wallstreetbets,"Problems in 2018 were caused by a constrained supply of the USDollar, no?

Huge demand globally as nearly all countries denominate their debt in USD. Many countries hoard when the dollar is weak as a result, to hedge against their outstanding debts. This caused yields to spike in the overnight lending market back in 2018 (look it up). Financial institutions were forced to liquidate assets as their peers weren’t willing to give up their dollars, causing those asset prices to plummet.

Now that the USD money supply has increased by whatever ridiculous %, it seems unlikely that we’ll have the same level of market response, which was exacerbated by the USD crunch back in 2018. In fact, we have the opposite problem now of too much money sloshing around and assets standing at nutty valuations as a result.

The problem is though with not raising rates is that as inflation goes up, the expected return for the lenders has to go up as well. And if lending were to become a 0 sum game vs inflation then liquidity would dry up and cause a recession much faster than raising rates would. Going back to 1970’s level inflation would cause mass economic upheaval though I totally agree, the dollar might not even survive that again."
2021-06-17 13:11:37,wallstreetbets,"The 70s are not a valid comparison. The ease of comparison shopping via the internet makes the general atmosphere deflationary rather than inflationary.

2021-06-17 13:28:35,wallstreetbets,"If the Fed were to raise the rates to ‘70s levels, now the deficit becomes a lead balloon. The deficit is humongously larger now than it was in the 70s. If they raised the interest rates to that level, I don’t know, everything comes to a dead stop.

What they want to do is to make the rich and corporations pay taxes. There have been recent years where Bezos paid $0  Dollarsin taxes, Amazon paid $0 Dollars in taxes, Musk paid $0 Dollars in taxes, Buffett paid 0.1% in taxes. There’s your problem. I’m not saying they should be taxed out of all their money, but 0% or so close to it as makes no difference is clearly not fair.

\- Collect the taxes you should be collecting

\- Have the rich and large corporations pay fair taxes (it’s not that everybody’s taxes have to be high, they just need to be fair AND paid)

2021-06-17 14:23:09,wallstreetbets,"> It wouldn’t change the interest on pre-existing notes.

You’re right, it wouldn’t. But the problem is an ever growing amount of federal debt is on notes with terms of 5 years or less. We’re not locking in 10-30 year rates like we used to, we’re taking out shorter term loans because the interest rates are cheaper. I think it was something like 60% of the COVID era debt was issued via short term bills and notes (I want to say under 2 years, but don’t quote me on that it’s been a few months since I looked into that), and we still haven’t really let up on our spending.

If the Fed has to raise rates to fight inflation, we’re going to be rolling debt forward at higher and higher rates, which is going to eat up an increasing amount of the budget. This means either more taxes, less government spending, or monetizing the debt via inflation. None of which are great for the economy, it’s just a matter of do you take immediate pain or kick the can down the road, and my bet is on the latter.

Just look at the CBO’s projections on the cost of debt interest - it’s going up and up as a percentage of the total budget, and that doesn’t factor in inflation not being transitory, so if inflation continues to come in hot, the problem is hugely compounded.

That’s just sovereign debt too. The economy as a whole is leveraged to the tits. Back at the tail end of 2019 when rates hit 2.25% shit was already starting to break and the Fed had to reverse course. We’re even more leveraged now, so we could be in for some trouble if rates were to approach that mark again."

They talk about the oligarchs' wealth being tied up in investments and the like and that there is no ""gain or loss"" to tax until they sell those investment assets.  Why nobody can market the idea of a ""property tax for wealthy portfolios"" to get regular people on board is beyond me.  The middle class gains a sizeable chunk of their ""wealth"" through home ownership and gets taxed every year on this asset and investment.  Have these people actually sold their houses to realize this gain or loss on the asset/investment?  Nope.  So why is it ok to support that sort of regressive taxation, but to suggest anything similar of our oligarchs and their wealth is some impossible riddle to solve that we might as well not even try to solve?  It's a joke that the plutocrats push through their ownership of the country via this lack of taxation and regulations allowing such ridiculous consolidation.  They push propaganda through the corporate media that somehow got dubbed ""liberal"" by their own propagandists.  It's absurdly and painfully obvious, which makes it more egregious."

Even if you assume CPI numbers are crooked, and that they might be manipulating weightings, you can look at the individual, unweighted numbers and see that there isn't much worth worrying about. Worth noting that inflation averaged 1.8% over the past 10 years, so technically, they have some leeway to push past the 2% number and still be fine.

If the argument is: sorry, it’s going to cost elected officials donations so we can’t charge them any taxes, then the system has failed. Americans who get unemployment benefits have to pay income tax on their unemployment benefits. Hyper rich people who could easily afford to pay taxes, they don’t have to pay any taxes at all.

That’s a systemic failure of policy. Everything is more expensive all the time, people have to make starvation wages work while being nickel and dimed all the time, the hyper rich: don’t worry about paying taxes.

3) I'd be interested to read more about your 'fun fact'. Per my understanding, Nixon ended the convertability of dollars to gold due to the concern that foreign central banks were taking delivery of gold with inflated dollars at fixed historical prices.

https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/gold-convertibility-ends

""With inflation on the rise and a gold run looming, President Richard Nixon's team enacted a plan that ended dollar convertibility to gold and implemented wage and price controls, which soon brought an end to the Bretton Woods System.""

...

""The deteriorating US balance of payments, combined with military spending and foreign aid, resulted in a large supply of dollars around the world. Meanwhile, the gold supply had increased only marginally. Eventually, there were more foreign-held dollars than the United States had gold. The country was vulnerable to a run on gold and there was a loss of confidence in the US government’s ability to meet its obligations, thereby threatening both the dollar’s position as reserve currency and the overall Bretton Woods system."""

In the US, because it’s an active topic, every citizen who is of legal age, should be allowed to vote by default. If they need documentation the government should provide documentation, at cost, that allows them to present at the polls with an ID \[we have one\], check in with an official so that we can be verified on a list of voters, and then cast our vote. There should not be a question that citizens and legal residents should be allowed to vote.

As far as non-(legal) residents goes: they should have the right to vote in their country, of course, that doesn’t mean they should have a right to vote in the US. It seems odd that they should want that. 

With regards to Ronald Reagan, he made that quip about the wellfare queen, which was total bullshit. You also hear talk about ‘pulling themselves up by their bootstraps’, which is biting sarcasm when you think about the fact that when black people did that, working hard and making a good living for themselves and their community in Tulsa, they were slaughtered for it."

2021-06-17 18:48:24,wallstreetbets,"Oh I agree with you completely, and honestly nobody (except maybe extremists on the very far left?) claims noncitizens should be able to vote, that's just a con talking point that was completely fabricated. They've been talking about Democrats getting fraudulent votes my entire life if I'm being honest, it was just never politicians spewing that and only ignorant locals. And when I say locals I should clarify I live in Pittsburgh so not exactly the middle of nowhere, but obviously not a massive city either.

I don't even really care about voter ID laws, I just know they are targeted to impact minority groups that vote Democratic. It is also an additional, albeit quick, additional step in the voting process. So when the conservatives gut voting infrastructure they target urbanized areas since they vote Democratic, less polls means longer lines on a day we don't get off of work and thus more sunk costs for voters in those places. Add in even a quick new step to check for a valid ID and I'm sure in a precinct that has multiple hours long lines to vote will take even longer. So is the requirement legitimate or is it partially legitimate while being abused for partisan gain? Then take my shitty state of Pennsylvania and the fucking law that passed o6ut Republican legislature (we have a Dem governor thankfully) in 2019 to allow no excuse mail-in voting, now they want to repeal it because of the Big Lie. Or if they don't do that they want to force signature verification for all of them. So some halfwits get to become signature experts? Jesus Christ talk about a joke. They're virtue signaling so much they want to get rid of the ""permanent"" mail in voter registration. Want to know what is absolutely hysterical with them saying that? The registration is ""permanent"" in name only, they have to mail and email you every January asking if you want to vote by mail that year, and if so you need to submit the paper application back to the state or do so online. That's hardly permanent IMO. But regardless, this state has had one chamber of government owned by the PAGOP since 1994, the other since 2011, and in that time they had **12** years of a trifecta where they also owned the governor's mansion. But guess what, the Dems are *always* the problem.

Ugh, I need to just stop ranting and say I hate this place and really want to escape. Thankfully I chose a career that enables this, I just need to sack up and leave."

Wrong. Just because inflation is a thing does not mean everything will appreciate in value. You can still lose money on stocks, options, altcoins, whatever.

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV FUNDAMENTAL🚀 CLOV is my next TSLA

The daily suppression and manipulation of CLOV by the hedges is well known, and there are plenty of DD’s on why CLOV will surpass $50-150+ in the short-midterm. However, I’m not going to get into that. My goal with this post is to explain how CLOV is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, much like TSLA did in the auto industry, and give my perspective on why it will outperform its competitors.

**TL;DR - First, intro - they’re changing the game just like Tesla did back in the day. Next, they’re growing, but the haters gon hate. Why? Because CLOV is the first of its kind and troglodytes hate change! Wrap it up - be dead inside, cuz studies show the highest returns went to people who are dead or forgot their account.**

**This is 10% Luck, 20% Skill**

Have you or a loved one ever gone to the doctor more than once to get a diagnosis for a problem you can’t figure out? The doctor reviews your file each time, but always gives the same answer: “Let’s do another test. I’ll refer you to…” It seems like you’re never making progress because either your doctor has run out of ideas or isn’t familiar enough with your medical history. Now imagine an elderly person navigating this same system, trying to remember what tests they’ve had done and their results on their own. This is impossibly difficult for anyone to deal with, and it’s exactly the problem Clover Health is trying to solve.

Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient’s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts.

**15% Concentrated Power of Will**

Clover Assistant is offered for free, and currently they’re taking a yearly net loss to improve their AI, which will eventually pay off just like Tesla’s AI. One problem they may face in future is their competitors integrating machine learning into their platforms as well, but by then Clover will be years ahead of them with no hope of any of them catching up.

**5% Pleasure, 50% Pain**

Last week CLOV announced new partnerships with [Upward Health](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upward-health-announces-contract-clover-124500091.html) and the [U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/09/2244291/0/en/Clover-Health-to-Scale-In-home-Primary-Care-Program-Through-Direct-Contracting.html), expanding their in-home and virtual service offerings. Considering the trend towards virtual healthcare, this is extremely good news and helps strengthen its fundamentals/growth. Everyone can clearly see how well Teladoc is doing with their in-home service, and this integration will only continue to improve and expand as they cater to our convenience/laziness. This is not priced in due to the volatility in the stock market.(Sidenote: If Hindenturd’s claims were even remotely true, CLOV would not be expanding their partnership with Medicaid/Medicare only for it to fizzle out in a year.) Besides, with all the fear of inflation, it’s important to remember that healthcare companies do really well during inflationary periods, unlike most other industries.

In spite of the evidence of growth, you’ll continue to hear nothing but bad press about CLOV, particularly being compared to its competitors. These comparisons are nonsensical for multiple reasons: first, this is not an outdated, dying business, it has a real future in the rapidly growing healthcare tech industry. Secondly, none of CLOV’s competitors currently integrate machine learning into their platform and are still using archaic methods of service delivery. Similarly, TSLA had bad PR almost daily when constantly compared to regular auto makers, even as the company continued to roll out new and improved technology like their autonomous driving tech. I did not let the bad press deter me from purchasing TSLA for $38-40 per share (price after split), and as the market and media has realized the nuance and innovation of the company my conviction paid off. CLOV is the same - it’s not just a regular health insurance company, it’s a disruptive tech company that uses AI to enhance its database for more profitable and superior care for their future growth. (Sidenote - One of my favorite investors Baillie Gifford has 5 million shares of CLOV, and he bought 2.3 million shares of TSLA at $8 a share during its bearish news cycle period.)

Circling back, why do so many analysts have negative sentiment towards Clover Health? It’s because they’re constantly comparing it to the outdated healthcare insurance companies, the same exact way Tesla was compared to Ford, GM, Toyota, and Nissan. In Tesla’s time, there was nothing else to compare it to - Tesla was the only one of its kind in its sector. Heck, Tim Cook wouldn’t even meet with Elon when he tried to sell his company to Apple for pennies on the dollar in 2018. Imagine passing on what would become a trillion dollar company - **MISSED OPPORTUNITY EEEEEK.** 

If the negative press was so convincing, it begs the question why didn’t institutions and Chamath dump some or all their shares at $28 per share? Because they’re not paperhand losers. These institutions rarely sell their stocks for a 2-3x return; when they invest, they’re looking to hold long for a much, much greater return. They base their investment decisions on solid fundamentals, therefore if they are still holding CLOV the company must have a legitimate future of success. **Institutions are not emotional.** Retail investors, on the other hand, are the real paperhands. Many get in for the short-term, make 100% return, give away 30% to Uncle Sam, and leave with 70% in change. This isn’t a bad return at all by any means, but a lot is left on the table when one makes emotional decisions. Take a look at any successful company and their stock volatility over its lifetime, and you’ll see MANY major dips. Folks who sold on those dips are probably filled with regret, but the Buffets of the world, who are dead inside, have reaped the rewards.

*""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""* 

* Warren Buffett

**And 100% Reason to Remember the Name (CLOVER HEALTH!)**

Like I said before, I’m not here to talk about the short-mid term potential of CLOV $100+, but rather the long-term potential of CLOV $100+. If y’all have been following Chamath as I have, you’ll know he's known for making conservative valuations. In 2018, he said Tesla would triple... it actually went 22.5x at its peak (currently at 15x). Whether you like the guy or not, he has a stellar track record. On top of that, he is one of the very few who stood with retail investors against market manipulation. This short-term volatility doesn’t deter me - I am long on this company, and will not sell my position for a measly 2-3x gain.

I’ll leave you with what I think is the most succinct outlook on Clover Health that’s been shared.

*“So when you bring all of this forward and you think about the future, here’s what I see in a nutshell: Number one… is a business that is actually delivering the promise of technology improving better outcomes and lowering costs in healthcare. Number two is a market that I think is huge and growing quickly. And number three is a business that is consistently taking share year over year over year. And so when you put all of these things together, in my opinion, this is one of the most straightforward investments I’ve ever made. It’s a business that I think will become extremely valuable. It will build a lot of enterprise value, and will be what I think is going to be our next 10x in 10 years investment.”*

* Chamath Palihapitiya"

* 100/100 Squeeze Score from S3 (Ihor)
* $700,000,000 in cash, no debt
* No threat of stock dilutions or market offerings
* Insider's can't sell stock unless stock is >$30 for 90 days
* Citadel owns 5x more AMC stock than CLOV, they take positions in stocks they short as a hedge or secret final weapon.
* Machine Learning AI Assistant for doctors and works with Medicare (growth market)
* Victim of hit piece from shorting hedge fund FUD Hindenburg (same people who slandered DKNG falsely in laughable reports), DOJ investigation from months ago hasn't gone anywhere
* Let's be real, high org ownership is actually kind of good for this squeeze, they're far more diamond handed than day traders or brand new apes.
* Last run up was from $10 to almost $30 - only 5% of shorts covered! For a 3x return we only had 5% cover. Imagine if we forced them all to cover. They've only seen a FRACTION of our POWER.

  
This is a fundamentally sound business using machine learning and AI to help docs make smart decisions with patient care. This both increases the quality of care and reduces cost of care, something our country desperately needs. Be a patriot, consider CLOV!"

2021-06-17 11:55:23,wallstreetbets,The company’s quarterly financials beg to differ.
2021-06-17 12:13:11,wallstreetbets,"This Clover Assistant is really not all that you make it out to be. It's just a coding app to improve risk capture for providers. Optum does this already for huge systems and small providers, and there are a hundred companies out there that do the same thing. Also, not sure if you heard of Epic, Cerner, and a bunch of EHRs that are way ahead of the beat on this.

I have not seen a single Clover DD post that seems to understand current reimbursement. These ""tech"" insurance companies like Oscar and Clover are making money exactly the same way as every insurance company has for decades. There's no real innovation. They are focused on a niche market and are another middlemen in this fucking crazy system the US maintains. 

And you know what, if we change laws in this country to make sense, this business is not viable anyway.

CLOV puts all the way."
2021-06-17 12:58:09,wallstreetbets,CLOV to Mars 🙌💎🚀🌝🦧🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀

2021-06-17 11:03:56,wallstreetbets,Though CLOV is being manipulated as a distraction.  I took out PUTS ON CLOV and they are paying.  How do I share my screen shot?
2021-06-17 11:37:09,wallstreetbets,Why do all the positive posts about CLOV and all the top posts on the CLOV specific sub are by accounts only recently made? Like your acc they 90% less than 6 months old.
2021-06-17 12:59:48,wallstreetbets,That's alot of words from a fucking shill account. 4 months and only pumps CLOV. Whats the betting the top comments are also 4 month old accounts?
2021-06-17 19:54:06,wallstreetbets,They should partner with MindMed. As they have similar interest in technology

2021-06-17 10:52:13,wallstreetbets,Clover has promise but you people are extremely impatient. Tesla took years to peak. This could easily take another 10 to 15 to pop. Not sure why anyone expects this to boom over night. 🤔 At the end of the day it will only move if fomo triggers or the large firms with billions start to invest. There is no way of predicting this.
2021-06-17 12:41:58,wallstreetbets,This little m0nkey bought 3 more shares 💎👐💎 bought before the first boom and sold for baby gains but gains nonetheless. Bought the dip cause I like tendies.

2021-06-17 14:29:13,wallstreetbets,I'll be interested in getting back in when this is back in the $7 range

2021-06-17 10:16:56,wallstreetbets,They have 4 employees and they overcharge their patients while making millions in profit. Its a no from me 😁
2021-06-17 12:05:04,wallstreetbets,"The CLOV puts I opened are printing nicely this week. I almost wish they didn’t and I wound up with the shares. May have to buy in soon, but thanks for the volatility!"

2021-06-17 14:01:59,wallstreetbets,For the OP to only have four postings and all about pumping CLOV is a touch suspicious. Don’t be fooled by this shill.
2021-06-17 16:10:04,wallstreetbets,Clov is funded by citadel. Idk wtf your talking about you bot

2021-06-17 13:12:23,wallstreetbets,"It sounds like a fancy description for a centralized database. Why would it need machine learning and AI to consolidate records from multiple providers, does it tell the doctor ""patient has already had a CT scan with contrast and an MRI, so the next step is to drill a hole in their skull""?

If it does that and comes with an Emergency Medical Hologram, I'll buy it."

2021-06-17 11:38:23,wallstreetbets,I mentioned this as well. Why are all the pro CLOV posts and 90% of all top posts on the CLOV sub made by accounts less than 6 months old? Most exactly 4?

2021-06-17 12:31:02,wallstreetbets,"I mean January was when GME got all the media attention. Why is it hard to believe people would have wanted in on that and created a Reddit account to follow? 

OP has some good insight when it comes to knowing where to invest and they’ve shared their portfolio already which shows they’re up on the shares they have. 

Take off your tin foil hat and you might learn something and make money instead of hating. It’s ironic since it’s a stock being shorted hard by shills and you’re dismissing info that would cause them to lose money.

No matter how nicely you try to tell someone to back their claim with a source, if they don't want to learn, they will lash out immaturely like our sad cantaloupe friend.

Each online e-commerce has a different market level to who it caters to and $WISH is cater to lower income level people and the stock price has plenty of room to grow from this price point. Just look at walmart (cater to most income level but heavily focus on lower level income), how many people waiting in line to check out buying their daily needs (trinkets or maybe junks) compare to bezos' wholefoods."

2021-06-17 11:57:53,wallstreetbets,E-commerce is already where the world is now lol. You're about 15 years too late. I don't think all these posts from shady accounts pumping/shilling WISH are a coincidence.

2021-06-17 11:20:45,wallstreetbets,"Trying to offer a bit of a counter just to help other apes who might be considering WISH.

What differs WISH from etsy/amazon/ebay/craigslist/shopify/magento/etc?
Going through their interface it looks to be all China imports.
Cannot click sellers name/company to find details. Good thing about amazon/ebay/etsy is you can see info on the seller.
Good thing about etsy is you can specifically filter by ""made locally"".
Price changes when you start looking at items (eg. pick a t-shirt, change it's color and the price changes - never seen that on Amazon - only w/ size change).
Differentiator cannot be interface alone.
Log in required to easily browse items (you can click the tiny tab at the bottom to get to ""categories"" - a roundabout method). High friction.

Granted if they blow enough on marketing, the sheer volume of marketing will force many sellers to concede and create a WISH presence. Much the same way companies were ""forced"" to create a presence on Google's old ""Google Plus"" (lots of FOMO). But if that's the case and they don't have fundamentals (NOT only equity fundamentals, but also ECOMMERCE fundamentals), they will burn hot and short.

...just my $.02 as an ape with no brains..."
2021-06-17 11:01:21,wallstreetbets,"Yup. 

eBay I see as a dying platform. Seller fees are too high, they've ditched PayPal and increased their own bottom line. Facebook marketplace is far better for anything local. eBay haven't done anything new in over a decade. 

Amazon is just too damn big. It's going to face anti-competitive issues in future, and it may not be able to buy it's way out of them in the EU. I'd still buy shares, but you aren't going to get significant gains over the next 5 years. Maybe 2X if you're lucky. Market cap is fucking massive and growth will be difficult in a global economic downturn. 

I've already cancelled my Amazon prime membership, due to cutbacks in my salary as a result of covid. As the western middle-class become more frugal, Amazon will be dropped. I'm no longer prepared to pay a price premium, and a monthly subscription, for convenience. 

This all really puts a company like WISH in a very good position. 

Not a shill, check my account."
2021-06-17 12:41:27,wallstreetbets,"Have you been on this website? Tried to order anything, or even found a product that didn’t seem like complete crap? Ebay and Amazon aren’t even in the same game."
2021-06-17 10:48:40,wallstreetbets,"This is my question. 

Even with the Reddit shills, this is a good price and I do have good confidence in WISH's ability to grow. It's why I've invested, despite a little pump and dump."
2021-06-17 10:48:51,wallstreetbets,Not me 🤑
2021-06-17 14:18:52,wallstreetbets,"yes and it is not good, but it might be a decent investment short term?

Many items being sold are knock offs and scams, but there are a few that are worth the money and months long shipping, as everything is cheap."
2021-06-17 10:33:19,wallstreetbets,You think amc is somewhat better?

2021-06-17 10:34:07,wallstreetbets,"Amazon has billions of China crap. Look where they are at. This is a long term. People who are not invested in now will regret it. Then probably buy into around $20/30. Then the ones that don’t get in then, will probably get in around $40/50 range. It’s only going to go up. It’s all about patient."

It’s been beaten up.. I made some decent money off trading $10-$12.50 calls while it was bouncing from $7-$9.  I planned on the stock  rebounding back to $16 by august. 
But then the Reddit crew caught wind of this too.

I think AliExpress is a direct competitor. I'm surprised they're still in business."
2021-06-17 18:25:06,wallstreetbets,I bought a laser pointer for my cats off wish lol. It was literally a dollar. Its good if you have some need for dollar store items but you're too lazy to go the dollar store. Otherwise its just toys for adults.

2021-06-17 11:19:22,wallstreetbets,because its a bot. who the fuck yolos 200k on wish
2021-06-17 11:17:30,wallstreetbets,It’s trading roughly around 2 times 2021 expected revenue. As CEO has said they don’t care about profit at this stage of expansion. They can easily show profit by reducing their advertisements on Facebook which is their biggest expense. CEO is very smart and knows that it’s better to trade off profit right now for expansion.
2021-06-17 13:58:18,wallstreetbets,You're not seeing DD on this stock because it's a bad play being pushed by bots and shills to distract people from the big squeezes. Same with $CLOV and all this other bullshit

2021-06-17 11:03:26,wallstreetbets,"But they aren't really expanding.  Amazon was building out a huge distribution network to get things to people faster.  Wish says... Ehh it gets there eventually, the seller is responsible.  So they aren't building out anything like Amazon."
2021-06-17 14:00:40,wallstreetbets,No they aren't doing anything like Amazon.  Amazon built out a huge delivery network.  Wish is nothing but a marketplace for third party sellers that do the shit themselves.

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$JMIA - The Amazon of Africa  

Today we’ll take a dive into JMIA (Jumia) Africa’s biggest e-commerce company.


**I  have a lot of experience in population growth and economic development  in developing countries. Africa is poised to be the next area of rapid  economic growth, now that places like China/Vietnam are having a slow  down. Most continent’s populations will falter over the next half century, the  majority of growth will take place on the African Continent -** **📷** [Graph of Human Population Growth - From Business Insider](https://i.insider.com/55d38ec0dd089595388b46c6?width=1200)



I  am betting on JMIA holding down and expanding their footprint on the  African continent as they poise themselves to grow along with the  continent.


**TLDR - Ideal stock for day trading as it bounces like a kangaroo. Otherwise I'd go long, leaps and shares**


**What’s Jumia?**


Jumia  is Africa’s biggest e-commerce company. Its core business is focused in  11 countries on the continent representing around 70% of Africa's GDP  and population. Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, Ivory Coast,  Egypt, Uganda, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Ghana. They have been  expanding rapidly to get their foot down in as many countries as  possible without stretching themselves too thin. They have a business  model similar to ebay, in that many products are sold by private  sellers. Since the start of the pandemic, they have pivoted their  business to also deliver groceries as well as take-out food.


Nigeria  is Jumia’s biggest market so here is their website if you would like to  pursue phones, penis pills, or clothing. Browsing their website you can  get an idea of where they’re pivoting their business.


Nigerian Website - [www.jumia.com.ng](http://www.jumia.com.ng/)


**E-Commerce**


**I  am very bullish on JMIA but I will address the bearish argument before  explaining how Jumia has adapted quickly to address these issues and get  on track to profitability.**


The  bearish argument against JMIA and the question many people ask  themselves when considering e-commerce in Africa is logistics. Africa  has some of the worst infrastructure when considering the movement of  people and goods. Both due to poor road/transportation networks as well  as a dizzying amount of bureaucracy and little cooperation between  neighboring countries.


While  unrelated to Jumia, this American guy who’s a truck driver in Africa can  give you an idea of the difficulties of traveling - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GslPzhFLyas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GslPzhFLyas)


Even urban centers don’t have addresses which makes the delivery of goods a big game of cat and mouse. [This video from 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dut-Ln5qOSM)  can give you an idea of problems that Jumia was facing.  As you can see  in that video the biggest issue they’ve had since starting their  business is getting packages into people’s hands at a faster rate.  According to their [2021 Q1 Earnings Report](https://s23.q4cdn.com/836376591/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Jumia-Q1.21-11.05.21.pdf)  Jumia has 1,600 pick up stations across Africa, something which they  didn’t even have in 2019. It is the same concept as Amazon Lockers,  where a person’s goods are put in a locker to be picked up at their  convenience. 23% of packages delivered in Q1 were to pick up stations.  During their Q1 earnings, the company stated the potential of their pick  up stations


“We view pick-up  stations as a strategic asset for the future growth of our platform. In  addition to providing more convenience options for consumers and cheaper  delivery costs, they are physical touch points that bring the Jumia  brand closer to consumers. We are increasingly leveraging them as  ordering points where consumers can place orders with the help of the  pick-up station staff which helps educate consumers and build further  trust.”


To give you an idea of their use in more remote regions -


“some  countries such as Ivory Coast, pick-up stations are proving to be a  compelling alternative to door delivery and a key tool to expand  e-commerce penetration beyond primary cities. We see meaningful  opportunity in supporting equitable economic development in secondary  cities and rural areas, which led us to establish a scalable pick-up  station model in partnership with CDC, the UK’s development finance  institution. These outlets serve as both pick-up stations and ordering  points. They are operated by local entrepreneurs who earn income from  the delivery fees they receive on package delivery and commissions on  orders placed from the outlet.”


To show what they mean, here is a long list of pick up stations in Kenya- [https://www.jumia.co.ke/sp-pickups/](https://www.jumia.co.ke/sp-pickups/)


Another  issue noted in the video is pay-on-delivery which has been immensely  popular for them when they had initially started. Even when someone  tries to use a card they often have issues with mobile card readers. For  this reason Jumia had started JumiaPay - Their example video - [https://youtu.be/Wh7KsLyO0PA](https://youtu.be/Wh7KsLyO0PA)


JumiaPay  enables users of Jumia to connect bank accounts and separate cards all  in one place, a great convenience especially for anyone selling on  Jumia. Described in an interview with the CEO of a website I can't mention,  JMIA sees JumiaPay as an introduction into mobile banking for Africa, a  place that has not has much exposure to mobile banking.


They’re  so bullish on their business that the CEO stated “The company wants to  be in a position to spinoff Jumia Pay and Jumia Logistics when it  becomes relevant enough to consider, he said. Although, he noted Jumia  is ""years away"" from considering spinoffs of those assets”


Since  2020, they have started their own in house advertising agency, Jumia  Advertising, an” in-house digital advertising agency catering to both  Jumia sellers and third parties, ran over 283 campaigns on behalf of 137  advertisers. These include high profile partners such as l’Oreal, Leroy  Merlin, Adidas, Unilever, Danone and many more.”


**Jumia Food -**  they have been running Jumia food for more than 9 years and now and  basically have their own DASH business. As you can expect, the business  has done well during the pandemic. [Here is an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1U2qLBwA_M) with the CEO on Kenyan Public Television, he explains the success they have had during the pandemic.


As  you can tell, JMIA is coming out to take over the e-commerce space in  Africa. While they have smaller/regional competitors, none of them have  the footprint and services like Jumia. Which is what makes me extremely  bullish on JMIA in the long term.


My  conviction to go long on JMIA is from my understanding of the long-term  growth and development that will take place in Africa. Jumia stands to  profit immensely from any development in Africa and will continue to  dominate the e-commerce space as more Africans enter the middle class  and want to enjoy the same convenience/luxuries available in The West.  They have shown they're capable of pivoting quickly when needed to fit  the ever changing needs of the respective countries they operate in.


Two  of the biggest takeaways from the UN's 2050 agenda is that by 2050 two  in every five children will be born in Africa and that Urban population  is expected to triple. In Africa, the average age is 19 years old and  rapidly getting younger. The continent is growing so quickly that by  halfway through this century, it will be home to one billion children.


This article from the economist is a great example of the growth that will occur in Nigeria alone - [https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/03/26/africas-population-will-double-by-2050](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/03/26/africas-population-will-double-by-2050)


While  Africa is always slept on when considering business and commerce, it is  one of the last places to be underdeveloped and will bloom once more  manufacturing is relocated to the continent after wages and standard of  living rises high enough in East/SE Asia. Similarly to how many things  were made in Taiwan/South Korea, which then moved to China and now to  Vietnam. As wages rise in these places, manufacturers will move to  Africa in order to take advantage of lax labor laws and low wages,  spurning the continent’s industrial boom.


Short-Term  Potential Roadblocks - While the pandemic has slowed down in the United  States, the large majority of Africans are unvaccinated. Which means  that many countries have/are under travel restrictions and may affect  business in the short-term. However Jumia has fared well over the last  year so I believe they are capable of overcoming any of those challenges  in the short term.


I am not into  astrology so I wont draw any lines on any charts. This is great stock to  make little trades on here and there because of its volume. However at  under 3 billion dollar market cap, I consider this a great time to  invest. I will continue to buy more shares weekly and scalp calls here  and there.


Positions - 60 shares and 8/20 $35c


Eyeing 12/17/2021 40c & 50c - I am confident in JMIA reaching that range by EOY.


Anyone  who knows me on reddit will know this is my favorite stock, I will  continue to build off of this to give updates on JMIA. Long $ JMIA

I live in Africa and I think you misunderstand just how bad the lack of e-commerce and road infrastructure is despite addressing it and the absurd capital requirements in order to develop it to the same scale as even other developing countries. Not only that but jumia is also outdone by takealot (a South African company owned by naspers) naspers has hundreds of billions in assets and is one of the biggest companies on earth, jumia will have to face competition such as that. It also has an absurd valuation trading I think 23 times revenue? It was a good bet when it was 500 million to a billion. But at 2-3 billion it’s a silly move. It also is known for being unreliable and low quality, I have personally used the service and the competition is far superior."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CANO - An undervalued stock and a way to profit off boomers.  **Section 1: What is Cano Health?**

Cano Health is a Florida centered value based care provider serving 103,000 people in America across 12 markets. That number is projected to grow to 300,000 by 2023. Cano Health is a primary care provider compensated through a fixed per member monthly fee from insurance companies. Because of this, Cano Health (and comparable companies) assume all risk and reap all benefits from costs of treatment. This structure incentivizes preventative care to stop health issues before they happen, which means lower costs for patients and Cano Health. This can be seen in action through Cano’s lower than average mortality rates, hospital admissions and ER visits. Cano Health recently went through a reverse merger with Jaws Acquisition Corp, and now trades publicly as $Cano. Cano Health presents us with an investment opportunity that has more than 100% upside, all the while allowing us to invest in a high growth and high TAM company with great institutional backing.

[ Cano has seen massive growth over the past 3-4 years, and will continue to do so. ](https://preview.redd.it/h2cdercf0u571.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=2424abe222f9f017de5befc1e32567ac7f1781d5)

[ Medicare Advantage has seen good YoY growth, taking market share from Original Medicare. ](https://preview.redd.it/j167hdfh0u571.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=d232516fdf2dcff198e81604cc20f622e0fc3bd3)

**Section 2: How do Medicare and Medicare advantage work for senior citizens?**

Medicare is a government run taxpayer funded health insurance program for primarily senior citizens over the age of 65 (barring some exceptions). Medicare allows senior citizens to go to any care provider who accepts it and receive treatment/care. Medicare is broken up into 4 key parts, which are the following:

1. **Medicare Part A:** Medicare Part A covers **Inpatient Care in Hospitals, Skilled Nursing Facility Care, Hospice Care and Home Health Care.** This is generally at a low cost to most seniors, provided they have paid Medicare taxes for a long enough period. They still may have some coinsurance payments and deductibles however.
2. **Medicare Part B:** Medicare Part B covers **Services from doctors and other health care providers, Outpatient care, Home health care, Durable medical equipment (DME) (like wheelchairs, walkers, hospital beds, and other equipment), and Many preventive services (like screenings, shots or vaccines, and yearly “Wellness” visits).** Patients using Medicare Part B generally have to pay a monthly fee (similar to normal health insurance), and in doing so, any care received by the patient is covered and paid for by Medicare.
3. **Medicare Part C:** Medicare Part C is also known as Medicare advantage. This is essentially an all in one package that serves as an alternative to Original Medicare (Parts A and B). Medicare Part C is fulfilled through private companies which are vetted and approved by Medicare. These packages generally include the benefits offered in Medicare Parts A, B and D, but may also include other services such as **vision, hearing and dental.**
4. **Medicare Part D:** Medicare Part D is an optional Medicare program run by private companies who are regulated by Medicare. It’s primary purpose is to **Help Cover Costs of Prescription Drugs and Protect Patients Against Future Increases in Drug Prices.**

Currently, there are 24.1 million seniors on Medicare Advantage plans, representing \~30% of all Medicare patients. This creates a massive TAM of tens of millions of new customers, representing billions of dollars. 

https://preview.redd.it/4duve4am0u571.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2304cb9f413cf44b255722efe6e5d8f5ef40cc12

 **Section 3: How does a value based care model differ from a fee for service (FFS) model?**

Traditionally, Medicare has run on a fee for service model. This model operates like such: A patient comes into a Medicare accepting facility for a routine health checkup. 10 tests are run on the patient whilst they are there. In the fee for service model, Medicare is billed for all 10 of these tests individually. This model creates incentive for more individual services (Volume) to be done on patients, rather than high quality and important care. Under fee-for-service models, cost variations for procedures and tests increased and the healthcare industry was spending more to treat patients even though patient outcomes were not necessarily improving. The model also challenged provider workflows because physicians were seeing more patients and each claim had to be processed in a fragmented network. On the flipside, Value based care models create a much better environment for everyone. Value based care models are based on patient outcomes, not quantity of services provided to patients. Unlike the traditional fee for service model, value-based care is driven by data because providers must report to payers on specific metrics and demonstrate improvement. Providers may have to track and report on hospital readmissions, adverse events, population health, patient engagement, and more.

[ Cano Health has successfully lowered Mortality Rates, Hospital Admissions and ER Visits despite Covid-19 and all the challenges brought with it which proves the model's success. ](https://preview.redd.it/2sud290r0u571.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fccc2b17a0437cf2f7522a34a6f67b011d78e020)

 **4. What makes Cano a good investment?**

Cano Health has many compelling arguments as to why it is criminally undervalued, and they are the following:

1. **40% organic annual membership growth with additional growth from acquisitions.**
2. **Has strong tailwinds in an industry with increasing pressure for cost reductions, and a shift towards value based care from fee for service care.**
3. **Cano currently serves 113k members in 15 different markets. With this, they only have 6% penetration in existing markets. The overall TAM is enormous at 24.1M Medicare Advantage enrollees in 2020 with that set to grow in the future years. This leaves Cano with plenty of runway to grow organically and through acquisitions**
4. **Extremely favorable comps to OSH which put a fair value for this at \~30 dollars based on revenue multiples.**
5. **86% revenue CAGR**
6. **Raised ebitda, revenue and membership guidance from management.**
7. **Recent acquisition of University Health Care, increasing their market share and exposure in Florida, a place which is among states with the highest enrollments in Medicare Advantage in the country.**
8. **Reputable Analyst Nephron Research initiated a price target of $22 dollars, with more to follow from other institutions in the near future.**
9. **Great institutional PIPE holdings from the likes of Fidelity, Blackrock and Third Point, who in addition purchased shares from the open market to add to their holdings.**

[ Cano Health Trades at a fraction of its competitors Revenue\/EBITDA multiples. ](https://preview.redd.it/0mqe0f3y0u571.png?width=1105&format=png&auto=webp&s=30349844d5e25c21774beb427c51fe9cd0f0f8ec)

https://preview.redd.it/ebwngyb01u571.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb9486a4d71ebf4c6bad2e6dcfa255e6ac115d72

https://preview.redd.it/mv369xl11u571.jpg?width=1641&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7811f87e299751711642e761f96886be0e2bdc82

[Cano holds many advantages over it's 1:1 competitor OSH.](https://preview.redd.it/2n0b6x231u571.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4f920a07ced4827cd3227dd68570eb43c64e5e3)

 Cano Health has a significant connection and exposure to the Hispanic population in not only Florida, but other states as well. 85% of their employees are bilingual and 80% of Cano’s members are minorities. Most of the largest states for Medicare have substantial minority, Spanish speaking populations, which gives Cano lots of room for expansion, and a moat over other companies such as OSH. 

 **How Do The Charts Look?** 

[ For many months, Cano has been in an upward channel which seems like it will continue. ](https://preview.redd.it/l01cutt91u571.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f926a1c782d6b01d9043654db13ccf6c0b7004)

 **Positions or Ban?** 

[ I am currently long 100 October 15 12.5 calls, however any calls from July onward are fine, though there is inherent risk to buying shorter dated ones. Shares are also a good buy. ](https://preview.redd.it/7we9p4ac1u571.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3d1e54f21e7ebfefa85bf7b2b001c0d581cce6a)

**Tldr:** Cano Health is a criminally undervalued Medicare Advantage company with favorable valuations and metrics vs direct competitors such as $OSH. Cano has a massive TAM and good CAGR, and is a multibagger opportunity that should hit $30 in the near future.

[Yesterday I posted about $GOEV,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0k89j/car_wars_episode_ev_a_canoo_hope_why_goev_can_be/) while it took a hit from its high  it's still up over 10% from the post and I expect it to continue growing, it's a solid company with good fundamentals and everything I wrote about it holds up, same for $ASO. 

**What is $ASO?** 

ASO or Academy Sports + Outdoors is a sporting goods store that recently IPO'd and has not stopped it's steady traversal upwards since. With new institutional backing and investors plus unmatched earnings for its sector and a nice short float, I believe this stock has one of the brightest futures on this sub and it's JUST starting to get noticed.

**First things first, short interest!** 

Everybody likes a good *word that rhymes with fort sneeze*, $ASO short interest is currently 22% of the float. Compare that to their 1 mo 3mo or 1 yr chart and you can see that the shorts have CONSISTENTLY been BTFO. This will keep happening and analysts agree, it is rated BUY by every major analyst from barchart to fidelity to nasdaq. It's honestly a mystery why no one here is paying attention to it but once it starts  flying it wont stop until it hits $60-$70 where it belongs. Along with a **small market cap** this will move the stock quickly.  

**Unusual options activity** - Look at the option flow for the [past week](https://i.postimg.cc/02q48KLt/bullish-call-flow.png) and [month,](https://i.postimg.cc/fyHSg9Xw/bullish-call-flow-1-month.png) **100% bullish**, this has heavy implications since its actually at a 5% dip over the past week. A heavy influx of buying could potentially cause a gamma sq for this Friday as options writers (and theres’ been a lot of them) have to cover. [For more on a **gamma sq** look at this post by u/hyptisx where he did some math for it to happen by **tomorrow**](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o14jei/aso_this_week/) More unusual options via Nasdaq; [“ASO options are showing a volume of 17,370 contracts thus far today. That number of contracts represents approximately 1.7 million underlying shares, working out to a sizeable 75.7% of ASO's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 2.3 million shares. Particularly high volume was seen for the $40 strike call option expiring June 18, 2021, with 4,854 contracts trading so far today, representing approximately 485,400 underlying shares of ASO.”](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-tuesday-option-activity%3A-rapt-aso-scco-2021-06-15)

**Bubbling Sentiment on wsb** - $ASO doesn't need wsb to take off, it's going to do that based off solid fundamentals but it can get started much earlier if the word spreads. It has already begun due to multiple good DD's like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwysob/aso_your_yolos_dont_have_to_be_retardeda/) [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvg2py/aso_just_chris_brownd_earnings_has_a_si_of_225/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0udtf/now_that_shit_has_somewhat_calmed_down_here_lets/) amongst other. You’ve heard murmurs on the daily thread, don’t ignore it and get mad later, It will be on the top of the FOMO list soon enough.

**Low implied volatility** - This means July calls are still cheap for apes with plenty of time to reach them. June for a pure YOLO.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Now on to the stuff you probably don’t care about but should because it’s the difference between stocks that crash and ones that don’t. 

**Long Term and Fundamentals** 

LOOK AT THAT FUCKIN P/E. $ASO has blown earnings out of the water pretty consistently but last quarter was their best yet. With a **P/E of 10** (which makes this stock insanely undervalued) they currently have a forecasted growth of near **triple for 2022** Like I said earlier **every** analyst says this is a buy, stop falling for overpriced stocks with no fundamentals, $ASO has solid earnings and a terrific debt position. 

**Earnings** Earnings were absolutely blown out of the water this last quarter:

- Adjusted income of $182.5 million vs Q1 2020 $400,000 income 

- EPS estimate of 0.84 vs **actual eps of 1.89**
   
- Revenues up 40% year over the year to $1.6 billion with an estimated 1.51 Billion expected to a **1.58 billion actual**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**IN CONCLUSION** 

$ASO is long term consistent winning stock with short term potential for a huge take off. The only reason it's low at the moment is because it's new and retail hasn't really caught on to it but that's starting to change, get in while you can boys.

Huge amount of float owned by institutions and a high SI, coupled with it smashing earnings and being incredibly undervalued.

I have no idea but it just becomes more of a value buy. I'm very suspicious of some sort of motivation by shorts to keep it low"
2021-06-17 10:38:36,wallstreetbets,I think it's more impressive the earnings they've managed to pull off being a retailer in a pandemic year. Gun purchases always go up during democratic presidencies as well so that will keep moving.
2021-06-17 10:54:09,wallstreetbets,"Is Q1 2021 a ""pandemic year?"" Vax rollouts during that time period makes me think its in a grey area. And they made $1.3B in revenues Q1.

On top of this, guess which cities have the largest populations increases? Excluding Denver, there is DWF Metro, Austin, Houston, Atlanta, Nashville, Charlette / Raleigh. Except Denver, all are in ASO's region.

Im bullish as fuck on ASO."

2021-06-17 11:14:59,wallstreetbets,"Technically, yes it still is a pandemic year. The swine flu pandemic (1918) ran for 2 years, and the same swine flu (2009) ran for 18 months.

Until the WHO declares the pandemic ended... We're still in pandemic status. There are still countries around the world that are fighting covid-19 pretty hard. Just because we have our vaccines doesn't mean it's over. 
This is an actual global event in that if a variant mutates so far out of the spectrum that the vaccinations are useless, guess where we're at again?"

2021-06-17 19:00:11,wallstreetbets,The stock chart for ASO this week mirrors that for it peers (DKS etc) so this is industry-wide and should reverse any minute. ASO is in oversold territory now.

I was all about BB10 OS back in like 2015 or whatever, it was amazing and the blackberry hub feature was my favorite.

2021-06-17 18:12:32,wallstreetbets,". BB is already known for strong security how that is playing out in Healthcare is not explained in  the report. Anyone with insights ?

Sample:

>SECTION  1:  UNDERSTANDING  THE  CYBERTHREAT  LANDSCAPE The digital transformation of society and economies has impacted all aspects of modern life. Businesses, governments, organizations and people have become accustomed to real-time information, communication, and action. This increased level of connectivity has allowed us to become more efficient, productive and resilient. For instance, because of the mobility that connectivity has enabled, millions of people during the COVID-19 pandemic were able to work, “socialize,” and stay informed remotely while sheltering in place. Never in history has this level of information and communication been so readily and easily available."

Even though we consider BB and CLNE recently “meme stocks” I went heavy (by my standards) into both started into BB back at 9 but my double down after it had the mini explosion sent my average way up. I think with proper DD both are legitimate growth stocks and not overvalued at the moment giving both potential for fast gains as well as counting on strong growth eventually as long as you’re patient. The other meme stocks are either overvalued, rely on a squeeze or I don’t see strong growth in the future."

BB developed QNX (first commercial microkernel RTOS), they have been working on this since 2014.  Flash forward to now almost every car maker is designing features for self driving auto pilot program, but not their own OS. That is where BB steps in.   
On top of everything they are cash flow positive and growing in an industry that is skyrocketing.  IMO this is a long hold stock."

2021-06-17 12:40:23,wallstreetbets,"So this is a genuine question, I'm still trying to wrap my head around a lot of this stuff.  
I know what a covered call is, I understand the contracts etc.  


But I go to the options chain on Fidelity and the highest I see for BB for next week is 15.5.

I realize that I can put essentially any value I want in there, presumably it being too high meaning that nobody will actually buy it.  


I guess my question is this: does the highest value I see in the present option chain mean anything in a practical sense.

Put differently, relative to what you posted, would selling a covered call (I have 400@15ish) at 17 be likely to be taken?  


thanks"

Is volume the number of calls sold at a given strike price?

I'm thinking it has to be because looking at the values, it's definitely a more or less normal distribution.

Specifically, on the BB option chain I see that

Strike price 1 has a volume of 6

Strike price of 10 has a volume of 1100

Strike price of 14 has a volume of 40k

Strike price of 20 is back down to 4500

2021-06-17 15:12:27,wallstreetbets,"No problem, the closer ATM (at the money) contracts in the front months (earliest expirations)  will have higher volumes traded/be more liquid. Further away in strikes you get from where the stock is current trading and further out in time less liquid and wider the bid/ask spread will be.

Yes volume = number of contracts that have traded.

If you take one thing away from this make it to always use limit orders when buying/selling options. Especially in volatile/thinly traded markets. NEVER place a market buy/sell for options."
2021-06-17 14:43:33,wallstreetbets,"Furthermore, even if you select all of won't be all. At the peak of the AMC crazyness selecting all only showed 1 strike price that was out of the money (like $74 iirc), but if you did a selection of strikes you could write in like 70-150 and it would show options above $74."

2021-06-17 16:16:08,wallstreetbets,"Got it.  Because a market order in high volatility means it might jump way above or below the strike, right?

Oh yeah, in a conceptual sense, is it better to pick a strike price with a high volume to increase the odds or it being purchased?"
2021-06-17 16:17:13,wallstreetbets,"Good to know.     On Fidelity, once you choose sell to open, the pulldown for strike price shows far more values than the options chain page which also confused me.  But it's all starting to congeal like jello in my head.

2021-06-17 16:23:56,wallstreetbets,"A market order will fill at whatever the closest bid/ask is. In an illiquid or very volatile market you also open yourself up to front running and very bad fills if you use a market order.

You want to sell options when implied volatility (IV) is high and buy them when it’s low. Choosing a strike with a higher volume will give you better ability to buy/sell the option and get into/out of the position later on. If there is very little volume/open interest on a strike you are buying/selling you will most likely need to hold it until expiry or deal with the wide bid/ask spread and take that into account when trying to exit the position."

Is the reason to sell when IV is high and buy when it's low due to the differences in option cost (i.e. high when IV is high and low when IV is low) or is there another reason for it?"

As of yesterday starting at $18.78 per share MAPS is now trading above $21 dollars. I believe due to how long Weedmaps has been around this could easily be worth closer to $25 or $30 dollars per share.

Any other autists in here have any DD on this stock? I’m still new to this and believe a lot of weed stocks are undervalued, but as a newer player in the market MAPS is in a good position to provide value due to recent speculation of reformed marijuana legislation.

To reiterate, a large PIPE share unlock may be happening soon. For now, however, the suspicious call activity continues to take place. It is even increasing day-to-day — despite the a) high borrow rate, b) large short volume, and c) tiny amount of shares available to borrow.

These excerpts, taken from the SEC article in the link below, seemingly resemble the structure of the trade and should be referenced when drawing conclusions.

The description of the trading activity referenced in the following link was used by OP in the original post. It attempts to make sense of the data and techniques used to short the stock.

**Section 2: Buying More Time**

Today, the majority of deep ITM (in-the-money) call option activity was observed with $2.50, $10.00 and $17.50 strike prices.

https://preview.redd.it/uk1ydscoxt571.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=0417282a632b44117dc6ef12a35e25ad869aca3d

**The data above is used in the same way as the first post: to calculate the difference between volume and open interest on these low strike ITM calls. This figure is then used to calculate the total amount of shares “hidden” using the “Buy-Write” strategy.**

The chart (below) shows the turnover of short shares using the “buy-write” strategy mentioned in the first post. Between both June and July ITM calls — that were instantly exercised —there were over 1.8 million shares turned over on June 15th, and 2.2 million on June 16th. This is the HIGHEST amount since this activity was first noticed.

https://preview.redd.it/41wck13rxt571.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddac7ee090b9d9da13099c7e04189a3421875db5

This data pictured below is taken from Fintel.

https://preview.redd.it/f19q7qhsxt571.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=5673444f88182d8870f0bf6ef158d6e9f98bdf08

On June 15th there were 2.13 million shares shorted, representing 44% of the total daily volume, and on June 16th there were 4.57 million shares shorted, representing 35% of the total daily volume. Compared to the average short volume between June 3rd and June 14th, the total short volume increased 170% for June 15th and 360% for June 16th.

It is impossible to know where exactly the 1 million shares came from (let alone the 6 million over the last two days), but the prevailing theory explained in the original post was that the “buy-write” strategy was freeing up the shorted shares. Keep in mind this is only a theory and cannot be definitively proven.

More proof from June 16th instant exercising of the ITM calls is also shown below for additional support. Note that the calls were bought and exercised simultaneously.

6/18 10c HUGE VOLUME

Shorts are not covering and just kicking the can until lock-up ends"
2021-06-17 10:16:20,wallstreetbets,Been happening for awhile - in for 35 july and sept contracts
2021-06-17 09:53:18,wallstreetbets,I noticed this yesterday as well. I've had my eye on ARVL since I first caught those deep ITM calls being bought everyday in May. Some fund (or multiple orgs) has a large short they have not covered yet. I am pretty convinced this has great squeeze potential before the lock-up ends
2021-06-17 09:53:43,wallstreetbets,"Good shit brother, keep exposing their shady ways."
2021-06-17 13:18:18,wallstreetbets,Hmmmm real talk I didnt read much of your first post but it seems like some learning can be done.  I'll be taking a deep look into this tonight.  Bought calls after part 1
2021-06-17 10:20:05,wallstreetbets,Thanks for exposing their bs. I’ve added here.
2021-06-17 16:29:42,wallstreetbets,Wow this DD is killing AH 🤣🤣🤡

2021-06-17 10:45:20,wallstreetbets,"One question, yesterday you commented on my post saying that it was you and your team that found out some fuckery with this ticker. 

Who exactly is your team?"
2021-06-17 16:20:01,wallstreetbets,"OP Can we see your current position?

One minute after market close there was a massive dump and I'm kind of curious now...."
2021-06-17 11:10:17,wallstreetbets,I can’t even see how many upvotes this has and it has 28 comments but somehow has 16 awards. SHILL
2021-06-17 09:52:01,wallstreetbets,"Bunch of awards and no comments, sus"
2021-06-17 11:48:38,wallstreetbets,"Proterra better imo, much lower market cap, already an established producer with many partners (including daimler and Komatsu). They also have a large backlog, including a 300 million $ deal with MCPS (largest electric bus deal in history)."
2021-06-17 11:11:08,wallstreetbets,"Even with the resets, there’s not enough volume to beat the shorts. It’s more likely than not that they’ll be able to stall until the unlock. It’s a super long shot that they’d have to cover anytime soon."
2021-06-17 09:56:09,wallstreetbets,No comments and 15+ awards. Pump and dump scheme. Hes trying to exit his position lmao
2021-06-17 19:17:58,wallstreetbets,"New bag holders created.

Fantastic."

2021-06-17 09:57:00,wallstreetbets,"I agree. It looks like they're buying time, and it's not cheap with the premium they're paying on those options, yet still cheaper than the extremely high borrow rate."
2021-06-17 16:22:38,wallstreetbets,CRINGE
2021-06-17 16:52:42,wallstreetbets,The DD shows the illegal strategy of delaying share delivery in action. It appears it was successfully delayed long enough until share unlock. Just another example of how retail investors are at a disadvantage.
2021-06-17 19:18:57,wallstreetbets,The only thing this DD did was create more baggies lmao.
2021-06-17 11:47:58,wallstreetbets,No reason for you to get downvoted since he did say that he has a team: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o103qw/buyer\_bewarewsb\_degenerates\_being\_used\_as\_atms/h1yqrcv?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o103qw/buyer_bewarewsb_degenerates_being_used_as_atms/h1yqrcv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I didn’t know you could add a bunch a wrinkles to your brain in just a few months."
2021-06-17 11:36:44,wallstreetbets,Is it if the stock moved up 10-15% after his last post?
2021-06-17 09:53:33,wallstreetbets,i bet you the skin off my balls the stock will still shoot up
2021-06-17 09:54:52,wallstreetbets,I do have a lot of followers after the first post who were eager for an update.
2021-06-17 15:37:25,wallstreetbets,Even LEV is of similar ilk
2021-06-17 12:53:48,wallstreetbets,"Well, you saw what OP's first DD did to the volume and corresponding price action. It wasn't a large enough pump to force shorts to cover and the ITM call buying suggests they are not covering yet. But since this tends to be a low volume ticker, I think keeping that volume sustained is all that is needed to start a squeeze.

I agree with what you're saying tho. I've been in ARVL for a few weeks and thanks to OPs first DD, I more than paid for my trade. But a little more attention on this ticker and it should squeeze based on all the info presented"
2021-06-17 11:14:39,wallstreetbets,"Yes meaning that the short position will work and this stock will go to NAV or close to that area. The people bag holding will be hurt and lose opportunity cost. The shorts will make a killing and who knows what happens after that. 

Now if big volume comes in then this can go the other way and I imagine can cause a squeeze. Just my opinion."
2021-06-17 10:56:52,wallstreetbets,"9yr reddit member, high karma, and solid DD.  i dont think so."
2021-06-17 15:32:05,wallstreetbets,100% agree.
2021-06-17 16:22:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you. I've been following ARVL since pre before CIIC and loading up at every dip... Now what the fuck just happened today and right after market close was textbook P&D... And I didn't even notice these posts before now.

OP show your positions or ban"
2021-06-17 11:09:22,wallstreetbets,My 23c for next Friday are toast. Pissed I fell for this
2021-06-17 09:59:04,wallstreetbets,"The borrow rate has been going up every day for a month and SI% has been staying elevated/increasing. That alone says enough, imo"
2021-06-17 18:46:02,wallstreetbets,"So it seems like they registered for warrants to be redeemed, but we don't know when they actually become redeemable yet. This is my understanding, but I'm not 100% sure yet

If it isn't for a month or so nothing in the short term has changed imo. Will be interesting to see if there are more ITM calls tomorrow"
2021-06-17 19:33:31,wallstreetbets,Hey fucking retard shouldn’t you be commenting about rockets on some AMC post like the SIMP you are?

2021-06-17 11:16:45,wallstreetbets,"No upcoming catalysts, no real reason for volume to jump dramatically. 

It’s a good long play, but please do abstain from any sort of options for the next month or so imo.

I’m getting torches by a 23c for next friday"
2021-06-17 12:28:34,wallstreetbets,You know you can buy reddit accounts right? Look at this dudes previous DD compared to this one. Did he suddenly become way smarter in the last few months?
2021-06-17 15:42:43,wallstreetbets,Pissed you fell for it or pissed that you can’t do your own DD?
2021-06-17 13:23:31,wallstreetbets,"Lmao no one gives a shit about this dude, it’s probably all bots."
2021-06-17 13:17:29,wallstreetbets,"SOUNDS LIKE QUITE THE CONTHPIRATHY YOU’VE UNCOVERED!?!?!??

Or he just did his due diligence and is sharing it…"
2021-06-17 12:58:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that is fair. I have been accumulating July and September calls since May. Mostly in hopes that my squeeze theory is right. I was surprised to see a DD posted that contained all the things I have been seeing myself.

A lot of the tickers that get ""squeeze DD"" have pretty much ended up being ""right"". But the timing of it is the tricky part"
2021-06-17 13:37:17,wallstreetbets,think Jan 2022 is far enough out?
2021-06-17 12:28:35,wallstreetbets,You are getting torched because you took a risk on short term options. You should know that risk on anything that short on any option. It's not a good long play until the shorts pressure it to $10-12 and then see if the company executes and meets their trial or delivery numbers. If execution isn't there then the company may go nowhere. All the money from the original rally and this current short is where the funds made their money. None of these funds will risk going long if there is no execution but ready to cover their short at the bottom and buy up at NAV or below NAV to play long later when execution is being met. Retail will always be behind the ball and usually on the losing end of these trades.
2021-06-17 15:43:49,wallstreetbets,"Pissed that I bought the wrong option. Good play, I timed it wrong though. Broke my own rules ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)"
2021-06-17 13:23:45,wallstreetbets,Don’t be so naive...
2021-06-17 13:03:12,wallstreetbets,Yeeeah I know how FDs work buddy

2021-06-17 15:45:55,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I balked at the premiums and essentially FOMOd into a worse expiration. Who knows though this power has been epic haha

2021-06-17 18:04:25,wallstreetbets,Ah my bad i though it said July 4th. Even so…30 might be ambitious for this stocks ability. Hopefully the price drop today attracts buyers?
2021-06-17 18:12:42,wallstreetbets,"It should. We need WSB to climb all over this short squeeze. From what I’ve read, whoever the hedges are, are illegally buying calls to keep the price down. We make them pay for that bullshit and pump the piss out of it"

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The United States Steel Corporation - $X - is going to Valhalla with inflation this summer. **EDIT 6-17:** Market rallied tech as growth was flooded after news that rates were not increasing. This doesn't change the thesis, the next meetings will continue to project earlier rates as inflation absolutely won't be contained at this rate, and paper leveraged growth stocks are going to feel the pain the most after the quad witching tomorrow. Here are the HRC futures updated for today.

[HRC prices June 17](https://preview.redd.it/fv2zyphlwv571.png?width=1111&format=png&auto=webp&s=b54c7715edcd3c4a73528a87f755cca0346db194)

If you think steel demand is going to go down as we approach the biggest RECOVERY SUMMER with shortages all around the block and not enough workers / employment, think again. Inflation happens for a reason.

**This will be my final update to my DD, I fully accept that my thesis can be wrong and encourage you to do your own DD. I'm confident and remain bullish and bought the dip.**

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**DISCLAIMER:** I am not a financial advisor, do your due diligence. Magnum Opus on $X - the sexiest ticker in the history of the market.

**My position** \- 350 $28 calls July 9 added yesterday for $35K, commons from last year.

[Options proof](https://preview.redd.it/dez5h7f8ot571.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ed76855aefe60f69d0cef4f9e2c5f5bcab9551e)

**\*\*Markets had a rough day yesterday, but is primed to bounce back.\*\*** After JPow spoke of inflation and rate hikes, SPY dipped to 420.69 but swiftly rebounded like a check from your wife's boyfriend because he didn't buy into $X. This is what this post is about: The United States Steel Corporation ($X) and why it's not just 🚀🚀 to the moon, but to a whole new damn universe - of inflation and summer tendies. Some of you dipped into $CLF last week but we're going further. We Marvel multiverse now (ps Loki sucked ass).

**United States Steel Corporation a.k.a. $X steel**, is the oldest steel producing company in the U.S., and 2nd largest behind Nucor Corporation ($NUE). It was founded by J.P. Morgan, Charles Schwab and other rich ass wall street boomers in early 1900s. With an unstable market ahead due to inflation and fear projections, here are reasons why this boomer company older than Buffett himself is your fix of Pepto Bismol and Xanny combined, as Hot-Rolled Coil steel prices continue its All Time High run into the summer:

**\*\*Short Interest\*\***

Find it yourself, I don't care about it. Not here to pump short squeeze FOMOs, $X will print like the Fed in 2021 without it.

**\*\*EV demands\*\***

This one is simple. You know what all your Tesla or $WKHS or other EV companies with 10,000% revenue increase projections by 2025 with 0 production in 2021 need? Batteries, semiconductors, engineers and some CEO Steve Burns on TV saying ""wE DiDnT aCtUaLLy HaVe OrDeRs LoL"". But you know what ALL Vehicles need? STEEL. In the wise words of $Xzibit, X gon'... Raise prices. [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1399492488612691973](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1399492488612691973)

**\*\*Market Sentiment - Put/Call Ratios\*\***

[https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/X/put-call-ratios](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/X/put-call-ratios)

Refer to X put/call ratios in July. Even in June, while SPY is sideways or bearish, X bulls are simply greater in number than bears. If money rolls in anywhere in this summer, it's going to be in commodities that benefit from the rampant inflation in the meantime. Steel.

**\*\*Learning from History\*\***

[https://www.thefabricator.com/thefabricator/blog/metalsmaterials/a-brief-history-lesson-on-steel-prices-during-crises](https://www.thefabricator.com/thefabricator/blog/metalsmaterials/a-brief-history-lesson-on-steel-prices-during-crises)

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/jsw-steel-sues-top-u-s-competitors-for-metal-conspiracy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/jsw-steel-sues-top-u-s-competitors-for-metal-conspiracy)

Domestic steel companies - NUE, CLF, X so on - are in coalition to maintain control of the supply so they don't repeat history. What history you ask? US Steel stock peaked exactly 13 years ago in June 2008, along with many other steel stocks, then proceeded to fall off a cliff due to the 2008 financial crisis stemming from overleveraged greedy ass wall street banks getting defaults on their mortgage gambles. This was amplified by the fact that steel production was at 90% capacity for these companies all jumping in to take advantage of the bubble that had formed, raising HRC prices to then-All-Time-High of \~$1000. Needless to say, steel tanked after and they learned their lesson. You can bet your ass they won't let that happen again to remain ridiculously profitable post-inflation.

[June 2 HRC futures](https://preview.redd.it/r1n6lg7aot571.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=0255d98e0605d606a8c0351807171207c462a523)

[June 16 HRC futures](https://preview.redd.it/chssf8zaot571.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=540de73dc1d96c289718f1bdf51f815d3abb59e4)

Above are the HRC prices of June 2nd, followed by yesterday June 16. Steel stocks ran up to $200 when HRC prices rose to then-all-time-high of $1000 in 2008, and said stocks like $X are sitting at $25.75 now when HRC prices are at a NEW ALL TIME HIGHs of $1700 in 2021. It ain't exactly the same scenarios, but I'm bullish and there's room to run on the stock.

Steel stocks have run \~100-200% depending since Covid/March 2020. X has subsided for about over a month now, desperate to climb as earnings rise. I'm here to tell you that we're just finishing the appetizers, the main course hasn't even begun yet. The Wendy's salad was last week. I'm jacked to the tits with steel beams and ready for the entrée as it breaks out.

&#x200B;

**\*\*Infrastructure Plan\*\***

Priced in... Or is it? [https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2206389-biden-infrastructure-plan-to-increase-steel-demand](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2206389-biden-infrastructure-plan-to-increase-steel-demand) Steel shortage is rampant, and while other commodities like lumber have found some rebound and consolidation, steel is only running hotter as dem Hot-Rolled Coils allow them to. Why?

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/04/17/biden-steel-tariffs-trade/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/04/17/biden-steel-tariffs-trade/)

Along with continual demand, steel will receive government protection. Biden's entire modus operandi is ""for the working class"". He's not going to cut American paychecks so the government reduces leverage while endorsing inflation. \[China's cheap steel is slowly moving but unable to flood the market as they need theirs first. [https://agmetalminer.com/2021/06/14/raw-steels-mmi-chinese-steel-prices-correct-us-prices-continue-to-rise/](https://agmetalminer.com/2021/06/14/raw-steels-mmi-chinese-steel-prices-correct-us-prices-continue-to-rise/) Also, sleepy Joe knows he ain't got much time left. As he said in the G7 Summit yesterday, ""Xi and I are not old friends"", which literally translates to, ""I want homemade freedom steel, not that cheap dictator shit bruh"". Also, the bill will pass most likely this summer/fall as steel prices reach Historical All-Time-Highs. Last call to the tendie-train.

**\*\*So, why $X over $CLF and other steel or memes?\*\***

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-one-analyst-doubled-his-u-s-steel-target-price-51622818061](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-one-analyst-doubled-his-u-s-steel-target-price-51622818061)

* \* Quote from the article with JP Morgan's Glick initiating coverage of $CLF as overweight with **$39 PT** \- ""Glick’s Underweight rating on U.S. Steel ($X) stock is relative. Things are better for the company than they have been in years, but the analyst simply likes other stocks better. His price target is \*\*$41\*\*, above where shares are trading.""[https://www.barrons.com/articles/sell-u-s-steel-because-other-steel-stocks-are-better-bets-analyst-says-51623865736?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sell-u-s-steel-because-other-steel-stocks-are-better-bets-analyst-says-51623865736?siteid=yhoof2) **Above $CLF. He knows.**

&#x200B;

* **Technicals** \- Here's some charting back 9 months on $X and $CLF (orange line) compared - **From the technicals, my findings are as follows:**

[X and CLF compared charts, 9 months](https://preview.redd.it/am3d7uhgot571.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=8405aef585e9cbd68f46980d0f24a7904c069a05)

* CLF shares historically trade below X by \~$2-$4. This changed in February 2021, circled in chart as #1, due to X offering 42 million shares to the public, increasing the float up to \~250m shares. I thought this would be the turning point for CLF but investors gobbled it up and the dip was short-lived.
* This told me X is gonna X no matter what, it's the United Steel States Corporation founded by J.P Morgan himself among others. Even with ZERO recent hype while $CLF has WSB eyes for a week, you can see that X moved parallel (as steel should) to CLF, and maintains the lead. That will continue. CLF goes up, X will rise harder. More upside.
* **2** indicates the run-up pre/post earnings. Most steel companies report earnings at a similar time. CLF will be the next one in mid-July. Imagine steel companies continue trading sideways while their predominant steel product in HRCs rise to new ATH's in a recovery summer with infrastructure plans on the horizon and severe supply shortages. Can't? Me neither. Pleas fly again.
* **3** leading up to 4 in yellow circles are the market pullbacks in May, triggered by worse-than-expected CPI report. Remember last month? PLTR bled all the way down to $16, digital currency took a massive 50% hit from ATH, and Cathie Wood was no longer giving you wet dreams. But X steel? 24% dip down to $23.40 level, bought up immediately again within the week. Now, chilling on the resistance.
* **4** is resistance. Even on bloody days, X refuses to dip below \~$25.75 and $25.40. It's there right now as I type. Apart from that bloodbath in May, X does not dip below that channel in the two-month chart. Yesterday, it hit this mark again - market bled and X hit this resistance for the 10th time in 2 months. And I am about $35k USD certain that it's ready to bounce to a new high. Inflation is real, so where does money go? Hold cash and lose money? Lol, no. ""Guarantees"". Bonds/Trusts. Cyclicals. Companies that make money. X is going to make some damn money this year. Where does JP Morgan want to put their $500 billion?([https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-stockpiled-500-bln-cash-prepare-higher-inflation-2021-6-1030522253](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-stockpiled-500-bln-cash-prepare-higher-inflation-2021-6-1030522253)) ""Steel is a generational opportunity"" their words.
* X had lower earnings during the pandemic compared to CLF, but reported higher earnings (Adjusted EBITDA / EPS) in Q1 2021. As X has higher margins, assets and debt overall, US steel has a lot more room for recovery/growth than other steel stocks, which it is primed to obtain AND beyond at this rate. The Return of the King is in the works.
* X has dividends. It's small, but a company to post one of their most profitable years in history with raised guidance after a shares offering will likely return something to shareholders. RKT special $1 dividend? Torchlight Energy special preferred A dividend share? Not sure. Expecting something on this front towards their earnings next month however.
* Price targets by analysts don't matter and often, I'm more tempted to sell than buy depending on the coverage. But JP Morgan along with other banks are hoarding literal billions in cash due to QE, inflation and low rates, and they won't sit on it for long, they're going to buy in, if not already. They are smart money after all. Here are the price targets for $X.

\-Credit Suisse - $35 May 4

\-Morgan Stanley - $32 May 17

\-UBS Group - $30 June 4

\-JP Morgan - $41 June 16 (yesterday)

\-Goldman Sachs - $25 April 9 - this is outdated and will update by end of this month probably. No way we see below $30 in July IMHO.

* Thus, upside potential is higher for X. Among American steel stocks like $CMC, $NUE, $SCHN, $STLD, $CLF, and $X, US steel ran the least Year-to-Date (+50.51%). X steel also had the highest of highs among Steel stocks in '08.

[Steel Armageddon '08](https://preview.redd.it/hlvyxzxoot571.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fbc5f50b75d14f677e2a0c8c10a4d67654a4d65)

**But honestly, fundamentals mean shit and this is a casino. So here are two main reasons why I like $X.**

**1. Market Capitalization:** X's market cap is one of lowest among steelmakers. Their float at \~260m shares is half of \~500m in $CLF and other stocks like $WISH, $AMC, $BB, so on. Market cap is the biggest reason why we likely will never see something like $GME again. Before last week, CLF's daily volume of \~18m(4% float) was lower than X's volume of \~21m(9% float), despite having double the available shares. X moves more swiftly and momentously than you can expect of this boomer. I imagine X's volume to 🚀🚀 heading into July without a doubt. They are THE United States Steel after all, soon to post historical earnings in a commodity boom.

**\*\*2. The United States Steel Corporation. US Steel. Ticker -X-.\*\*** Fucking X. Understand? I own $X, and if it ain't worth just for the sexy-ass ticker and OG status, I don't know what the hell I would want to invest in this summer. The possibilities are endless.

What's an eXit strategy? Calls on X. See you in Valhalla."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why do people buy stocks over ITM LEAPs? I understand why people want to buy FDs for the huge gains if a meme stock moons, but I don't understand why people would choose stocks over ITM LEAPs.

LEAPS that are ITM around 0.7-0.8 delta usually cost around 30-50% of the actual stock price with very little extrinsic value, so there's minimum impact from volatility. The break even price is usually very close to the current share price. You would gain much more with the same investment if you spent the money on LEAPS instead, and you can still diamond or paper hands just the same.

As an example, $WISH (currently at $11.07/share) LEAP for 1/22 7.5c is currently $5.45. This gives a strike even price at $12.95. If you spend $1000 on $WISH and it doubles next week, you would net $1000 if you bought stocks with it, but if you bought the LEAP option you would net $2000 instead.

Also, while the break even is $12.95, this is only at expiration. If you sell earlier you recoup a lot of your extrinsic costs since theta decay is so slow. For example, if $WISH goes from $11.07/share to $13 next week and you closed the LEAP, you would make \~$300 even though it's right at your ""break even"" point. In comparison, the same investment in stocks in this scenario would only net you \~$170.

In addition to the greater gains, you also get a few other advantages from ITM LEAPs compared to stocks

1. Limited loss, you keep losing money every time it drops if you own the stock, but with LEAPS you can't lose more than your initial premium
2. Greater premiums for selling covered calls"

2021-06-17 09:54:40,wallstreetbets,"LEAPS are a leveraged position vs stocks. But if you dont buy 3 LEAPS just because they are 1/3 the price, it isnt much different risk wise vs buying 100 shares. If you hold a LEAPS over 12 months, you.get that sweet LTCG tax rate vs short term. I try to buy them at least 15 months out, so I can hold 12 months and still sell around 90dte, which is when theta starts eating the position. If Im trying to get gains from a temporary jump  in stock price, I buy shares and then sell shortly after. If I like the stock, I buy a LEAPS."
2021-06-17 09:13:39,wallstreetbets,"While the chance is lower for a worthless expiration, it’s still possible. Additionally, with deep ITM options the volume is much lower, meaning you generally don’t have the actual gains it looks like you do. Also stocks count towards marginable securities, options don’t."

2021-06-17 15:50:01,wallstreetbets,Maybe because some people don't want to play with leverage
2021-06-17 18:35:06,wallstreetbets,"There’s 1-2 dips a year (more sometimes) that would completely fuck up your LEAPs. Can you hold thru and come out fine? Often yes…but with shares you’re not wondering about whether it’ll recover or you need to eat an 80%+ loss, you’re thinking about how much to DCA.

I mean it’s leverage. Leverage means more potential return with less $ tied up. But let’s not try and convince ourselves it doesn’t come with risk."
2021-06-17 19:39:17,wallstreetbets,"Honest answer is that people can’t properly handle leverage. Whether it’s actual (margin) or implied (LEAP’s). If people do stock replacement and buy LEAPs they would end up buying the same $ equivalent rather than the delta equivalent. The one benefit to stocks compared to LEAPs is that it is very hard for a stock’s terminal value to be 0, can’t say the same for time-sensitive contracts."
2021-06-17 09:00:09,wallstreetbets,"Good points, but you better be 100% know what you’re doing. I suspect that fear of the unknown is what keeps people away from doing this.

2021-06-17 09:00:39,wallstreetbets,"If it's heavy ITM with a long expiration, there is a low chance that it expires worthless. And if the stock still drops below that, then you would probably be losing more money if you had bought the stock over the LEAP."

In your case, I would sell weekly calls for GS until it eventually gets exercised rather than just closing it.

Theta decay also ramps up starting 3 months from expiration, so if you are up that is a good time to close/roll."

If you instead bought 100 shares (current price at \~$11) for $1100, and it goes down to $7.5 you would lose $350. At \~$5.5 your loss is the same as the option, and below that you lose more. So it also protects you in case the stock plummets.

JPow told us all that inflation was not a concern and kept repeating that to endless reporters asking the same question over and over again.

Joe Shmoe gets home from work, turns on the news and sees nothing but FUD about inflation.  Why?  Because that's what keeps viewers tuned in the station and more viewer = more profit for the news media.

In a panic, Joe Shmoe loads up his new Robinhood account and sells everything.  He knows that is the right thing to do because he has heard that inflation is bad for the stock market.

Joe sixpack doesn't have extended hours trading, or doesn't even know such a thing exists, so on his trading app, he puts in a sell order to be executed when the market opens.

If you have doubts about what I am saying, just look at Gold.  When there are inflation fears, the smart money flocks to commodities like gold.  Joe Shmoe and Joe sixpack keep their money in cash because to them, a hedge is the thing that keeps their neighbor's dog out of their yard,

Gold is down because the smart money has wisely sold the hedge they no longer need, since inflation is not a concern to the Fed.

. . . and there you have it!

2021-06-17 08:28:25,wallstreetbets,No rocket ships? Are you lost
2021-06-17 08:39:20,wallstreetbets,During inflation there is a flock to gold. However isn’t there an exit in times of rising rates?
2021-06-17 10:00:57,wallstreetbets,Seriously. After actually listening to what JPow said yesterday I was absolutely appalled by the headlines the media agencies spun it into. Like it’s absolutely amazing that they are allowed to completely blatantly lie with no recourse from anyone

2021-06-17 09:13:12,wallstreetbets,"This can happen if the fed really puts the screws on, but studies have shown there is no obvious correlation between interest rates and the price of gold.

Of course, the fed won't really put the screws on until inflation gets out of control, and by that time gold will have risen a lot higher."

2021-06-17 19:27:27,wallstreetbets,This guy fux
2021-06-17 09:07:11,wallstreetbets,"Huge potential, acquisition news soon."
2021-06-17 10:07:27,wallstreetbets,I'm just shocked how many people don't know about NNDM
2021-06-17 08:30:33,wallstreetbets,How much have you invested in them?
2021-06-17 10:01:36,wallstreetbets,see you in Croatia.

2021-06-17 09:25:16,wallstreetbets,"good luck, NNDM is primed for takeoff."
2021-06-17 10:01:16,wallstreetbets,I'm accumulating shares every chance I get.
2021-06-17 15:14:55,wallstreetbets,"Ok seems like a nice DD post. The only question on my mind is this, if the stock has such good potential and seems to be a solid company then why has the stock done nothing but trend downward over the last 5 yrs? What would make it suddenly turn around after all this time?"
2021-06-17 10:38:14,wallstreetbets,precisely
2021-06-17 11:04:25,wallstreetbets,we shall celebrate soon!

2021-06-17 11:37:18,wallstreetbets,"that's why I'm so surprised more people aren't in on this, sleeping giant"

2021-06-17 16:14:28,wallstreetbets,"this was addressed by the CEO few weeks ago. Low sales few quartered due to Covid restrictions, CEO stated he's looking for 5x within the next 2 years."
2021-06-17 17:05:09,wallstreetbets,THIS!

2021-06-17 18:36:22,wallstreetbets,if you have watched the institutional buying a lot of it started happening when the price was low like below 10. ark bought in early and i think theyre average is around 8$.
2021-06-17 13:29:58,wallstreetbets,"Good question, lemme down vote ya"
2021-06-17 12:40:15,wallstreetbets,Reverse splits as well as poor management which have since been replaced
2021-06-17 12:24:08,wallstreetbets,Right lol
2021-06-17 17:06:36,wallstreetbets,Someone bought at the tops
2021-06-17 14:24:29,wallstreetbets,"NNDM is a shady fucking company, BUT no one here gives a shit about facts. They literally gave a fuck ton of shares to some random company for unknown services rendered."
2021-06-17 15:38:27,wallstreetbets,"Cathie ""Diamond Hands"" Woods doesn't have toilet paper hands, they loaded up and kept adding on the way down, currently holding 15M+ shares across all ARK funds totaling upwards of $120M+."
2021-06-17 14:29:49,wallstreetbets,"The offerings were genius and why I am bullish on the company, they raised a fortress of cash ensuring their long term survival and providing them with enough cash to pursue their long term goals.  The CEO has made it clear there is no longer any need to raise any additional capital & wants to see a 4-5x return for shareholders.   He capitalized on the market mania in early 2021 and ensured the future for Nano Dimension."

2021-06-17 10:35:43,wallstreetbets,Ah yes another person crying because somebody decided to post DD 🙄
2021-06-17 10:27:42,wallstreetbets,Wanna shut the fuck up?
2021-06-17 16:53:24,wallstreetbets,I placed my bet!! Come one guys let's believe in this team
2021-06-17 11:11:21,wallstreetbets,The CEO himself said don't buy shares if you aren't planning on holding for a while FWIW.  But I'd be ok with some momentum short term 🚀
2021-06-17 10:09:50,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I don’t mind, I rather have a slow steady growth then it becoming a “meme stock”. But it’s a steal at this price. Short term target around 10$ but in a few years this will reach 10b market cap with the revenue generated from their acquisitions."
2021-06-17 13:56:27,wallstreetbets,Not even listed on Wealthsimple.
2021-06-17 13:36:37,wallstreetbets,Probably 0 and is shill.

2021-06-17 10:27:53,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Check my out profile if you’d like, I also did a DD on them over a month ago."
2021-06-17 10:52:00,wallstreetbets,It's been creeping up over last few reporting periods
2021-06-17 15:23:23,wallstreetbets,"Totally, it's been slept on for to long!"
2021-06-17 12:33:13,wallstreetbets,How long is this long run?
2021-06-17 13:48:24,wallstreetbets,And MY Axe!
2021-06-17 16:21:01,wallstreetbets,"That's good that they have an explanation. I just did some math and realized that with their cash reserves it's actually over 20 years that they could operate in their current state with no sales growth and no more share dilution (burn rate is about 50M/year when I looked at statements). Considering that, might sell some of my INTC to buy this."
2021-06-17 13:30:48,wallstreetbets,Hahah Ight it was genuine question
2021-06-17 15:18:37,wallstreetbets,Thank you came here to respond but couldn't have said it any better myself.
2021-06-17 10:48:53,wallstreetbets,"He is clearly trying to get rid of his position.  If he believes his DD, he would be on /invest.

All these assholes that joined Reddit in Jan, Feb and Mar this year don't belong on WSB.  They think that WSB is some sort of investment club lol."
2021-06-17 11:45:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it was their earnings call from around march when he said told investors to stay patient. He has a very long term, steady, and cautious view for the company, and ""he won't make an announcement just because the share price goes up and down, we will make the announcements in due course."" He hinted 2022 or 2023 could be their huge years but of course those timelines could fluctuate. Very bullish long term but let's see how long it takes for the big movements to come.

2021-06-17 18:37:31,wallstreetbets,the price was never 80 it just shows that high due to reverse split. and it had new management before 2020.
2021-06-17 12:28:52,wallstreetbets,"I miss being able to scroll down and see who's house is being repod today, who's gonna spend the rest of their days working at Wendy's after they dumped their student loans into FDs, and see that one guy that actually did shit out a rocket say ""bye losers"" as he fucks off to Andromeda."
2021-06-17 15:47:17,wallstreetbets,Don’t hate the players hate the game
2021-06-17 19:30:32,wallstreetbets,crou-che.
2021-06-17 17:35:55,wallstreetbets,Man you life must really suck. Sorry bro. It will get better.

2021-06-17 17:38:04,wallstreetbets,Na. My Life ist oretty mediocre. Not better or worse than any others life.
2021-06-17 16:06:43,wallstreetbets,"sorry, typo"
2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cruiselines and airlines Cruiselines and airlines have been heavily shorted. To bet against them is to bet against America. The changing dynamic in how people will spend will benefit them. People are spending money on experiences not things. They will be beneficiary’s of the reopening. So regardless of what happens the positions will grow overtime so unlike some of the other shorts, these won’t go to zero or be cut in half in my opinion. This is not financial advise. Bomb to your risk level. Let’s blow the shorts off and bet on America. Happy bombing"
2021-06-17 08:32:46,wallstreetbets,Buying up cruise lines and airlines was an awesome buy about 12 months ago. Remaining recovery gains will be fairly slow IMO
2021-06-17 08:33:36,wallstreetbets,"Where is the evidence of heavily shorted?  I track  aal, dal, rcl, and ccl.  All have float held by inst at 40% or more and si is less than 15% on the highest one.  There prices have been on the climb to pre pandemic ones and were a bargain a couple of months ago.  There is still a little more room to go too."
2021-06-17 08:30:22,wallstreetbets,"You know that cruise lines and airlines operate internationally, right?"
2021-06-17 08:22:37,wallstreetbets,"As a pilot, I can agree with this but personally I’m not invested any airlines right now"
2021-06-17 08:40:15,wallstreetbets,"Cruiselines are gunna bleed this year.  All it takes is one case of plague in a boat with 9000 people to scuttle a whole trip.

2021-06-17 10:09:45,wallstreetbets,"I don't know about being shorted.... But I do agree that these two industries will hopefully pick up steam over the next year or two, taking their stock price past pre-pandemic levels.

On one hand, people have been locked down for so long, they are just itching to travel and do stuff. On the other hand, people have been financially impacted by covid so it might take a little time before they have the disposable income to drop on a big vacation.

I have stock in Boeing, and am considering Spirit Aero (component supplier to Boeing & Airbus)  and a couple of the cruise lines. Not too interested in the airline companies themselves, they run their own constant shit-show..."
2021-06-17 09:20:37,wallstreetbets,"what shorts? can you provide examples? and ya most of them are not american companies. you want to bet on the USA bet on USA steel, infrastructure... big bill coming..."
2021-06-17 10:39:04,wallstreetbets,"I have positions in Spirit, Mesa  and Sabre since last years March lows.  Airlines  as a whole have been on a decline since mid March.  Booking are up and hopping for a good pop up this next quarter earnings.  TSA numbers over 2million for first time in 16 months"
2021-06-17 10:33:46,wallstreetbets,Yeah a true bet against America is basically holding USD and agreeing with gov and fed decisions
2021-06-17 08:26:56,wallstreetbets,"I like this post, with guy fucks.👍👆"
2021-06-17 09:28:34,wallstreetbets,Yup. I bought UAL & NCLH back in April 2020. Haven’t seen much growth over the last 5 months or so
2021-06-17 11:09:40,wallstreetbets,"Been in or around the cruise industry for the last 15 years.  I made some good coin buying RCL when it was $20 a share in spring 2020.  Sold at $60 a few months later.  Way overvalued now IMO.  

You'd think at some point the stock price is going to have to reflect that cruise lines have gone more than a year without any meaningful revenue."
2021-06-17 09:40:18,wallstreetbets,"If you look out to the 5 year charts one something like CCL you still see some good potential, but also need to look into why they were dropping before the pandemic even hit. Recovery to those 5 year highs may take quite a while even if everyone returned to full travel immediately (Which we know they won’t). These guys are going to have some lasting impact from essentially 16 months of near zero revenue."
2021-06-17 09:45:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah I don’t see them or any cruise liner doubling anytime in the near future. I only bought cause I knew that within a year I can make a decent roi & then out that money into something else
2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RKT - Round 2 thanks JP! I’m going to make this super simple… With supply of housing market hitting all time Low’s in Sept of 2020 due to Covid and now rising steadily I believe there’s a second wave to the housing boom and it’s not in TIPS.  Housing prices I believe will normalize as supply increases.  But what do people need when they buy a home, Rocket Mortgages!  

If you look at the mortgage industry the last time the housing market supply bottomed In Jan 2013 there was a big rise in profits for mortgage companies. 

With JP promising to buy mortgage backed bonds for the foreseeable future and not raise interest rates for 2 more years… there are plenty of tendies on deck!  

Oh and company fundamentals wise Rocket is doing some insane growth in the network.  For example they partnered with Farmers insurance and they pay for the licensing of their insurance agents to get their mortgage license and cost for all of it.  Freaking brilliant way to grow your lender base. 

I easily see 50% upside for remainder of 2021.  Too many shorties beat down the last spike and got out but there is still a 20% short interest as well.  

My position is 19,500 shares at $19.67.  Will add 10k shares if we dip into 18’s."
2021-06-17 09:40:01,wallstreetbets,Rocket is on the move.  Set up is identical to last parabolic spike.  Let’s F’n go boys!
2021-06-17 10:06:32,wallstreetbets,Rocket is Fin tech. Great company
2021-06-17 09:16:02,wallstreetbets,"As a recent customer of RKT with my home refinancing I can tell you this is an amazing company. Their people, customer service, technology, everything is awesome about this company"
2021-06-17 10:18:18,wallstreetbets,I got faith that RKT will come out on top. 2356 shares and adding every time I get some extra cash.
2021-06-17 11:14:21,wallstreetbets,"Rkt, UWMC, And the biggest sleeper Tiptree will be great 1-2 year holds minimum"

2021-06-17 11:10:36,wallstreetbets,RKT to the moon love this stock!
2021-06-17 16:52:29,wallstreetbets,Great deals on RKT right now
2021-06-17 10:14:51,wallstreetbets,preach my man huge upside potiential! RKT is going to dominate and they are expanding into new sectors RKT homes and RKT Autos
2021-06-17 08:09:15,wallstreetbets,Thank you!! Awesome DD -we all in on UWMC!!!!!
2021-06-17 08:39:54,wallstreetbets,"I read about rkt for 10 hours before decided to skip it. All implied shares they own makes book value not so great. Already big company in matured industry. Not undervalued. Say what you want, but all I want to see is current results and what shareholders get for it, not what they are planning to do in the future and how they beat by shorties at $19 , when their actual safety of margin today as a shareholder is only fking $4."
2021-06-17 12:44:01,wallstreetbets,THE most hated stock on wall st...just dead $
2021-06-17 17:18:27,wallstreetbets,"No no, not RKT. We only bet on losing companies 😜"
2021-06-17 09:56:14,wallstreetbets,Rkt is a black hole to put your money… it popped once for 5 hrs and it’s all over buying leaps is throwing your money down the drain!
2021-06-17 15:31:51,wallstreetbets,BEST is the real rocket!
2021-06-17 17:19:17,wallstreetbets,-24% YoY refis this last month.
2021-06-17 09:36:54,wallstreetbets,Here we go!!!!
2021-06-17 10:19:42,wallstreetbets,Let’s go!  Moving quick!
2021-06-17 10:28:20,wallstreetbets,For once it would be great if WSB got behind an actual company growing rapidly and HODLED
2021-06-17 11:25:32,wallstreetbets,100% gains inbound for RKT!
2021-06-17 16:55:15,wallstreetbets,Fire sale!
2021-06-17 13:40:27,wallstreetbets,"Lol yes, let's try to wiggle into new sectors that were already heavily dominated by indirect lending and newer Fintech players that have years to develop... let me know how that turns out considering banks dumped the direct lending for auto years ago (yes they have auto loans, no we never do them except for private party deals)"
2021-06-17 08:13:15,wallstreetbets,I still don’t get the UWMC trade.  They do not have the tech that RKT does.  Nor the size.   What’s your logic?
2021-06-17 08:57:10,wallstreetbets,They’re getting an 8x multiple.  They deserve 10 at a min.
2021-06-17 17:22:32,wallstreetbets,Upvote for honesty 😂
2021-06-17 09:58:38,wallstreetbets,It’s being held down by a market maker.   Thy enemy.
2021-06-17 17:23:51,wallstreetbets,It’s summer and kids out.  Business all around for a lot of small businesses is down right now unless your travel/entertainment….
2021-06-17 09:08:54,wallstreetbets,"UWMC do more new mortgage,business will be good regardless of interest rate. RKT do mostly refinance, super low rates has been great for them but as interest rate go up not many gonna refinance"
2021-06-17 08:18:00,wallstreetbets,"Lol, wut? UWM is the IPhone and Rocket is the Nokia 6110 when it comes to tech. Uwm has a much faster time to close, does it cheaper, and does it more efficiently. Rocket spends too much money advertising and not enough reinvesting into their business. Rocket is losing market share by the day."
2021-06-17 13:43:15,wallstreetbets,UWMC is focusing on brokers and tech simultaneously. Also they were the largest wholesaler in addition that they pay a dividend that will allow investors to still have a fallback while we wait for proper valuation. So basically growth and dividend play makes me happy
2021-06-17 11:45:24,wallstreetbets,I believe that….
2021-06-17 09:37:38,wallstreetbets,"No UWMC is the IPHONE and RKT is fucking AMAZON. United has one market,  RKT is in 3 already,. Mortgage, home search(zillow competitor) and now auto sales.  That's like saying Amazon prime video is worse than Netflix like that's the only  business they own"
2021-06-17 08:25:15,wallstreetbets,Spoken like a true tard not in the space… They freaking use Loan Swap tech.  Rocket uses brilliant ranking tech and a CRM that runs circles around UWM.  They have the best lead aggregation strategies.
2021-06-17 09:55:02,wallstreetbets,"The Amazon? It’s more like a hotdog cart vendor that expanded their business into gyros. Uwm is focused on dominating the wholesale channel while rkt is throwing shit at the walls hoping it will stick. Time will tell the tale, my money is literally on uwm."
2021-06-17 08:30:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that’s probably the reason they guided down for next qtr, all their superior tech and such……. You should totally buy more rocket. Refinance your house through rocket and use the proceeds to buy more shares."
2021-06-17 09:58:38,wallstreetbets,Except that shit that hit the wall made almost a billion alone

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PLTR : A Tale of Two Daddy's &#x200B;

The following is not financial advice.  I just love Daddy Karp, Daddy Thiel, and the PLTR Stock.

We all know **Daddy Karp.**  This is him forcing his employees to engage in combat dancing or some shit...right, lets carry on.

[Daddy Alex Karp is a character, PERFECT for the memes.](https://preview.redd.it/agr1i21kjq571.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bf213a80de565ca37a90823e90e60d97c61e95b)

**So why does this matter?**  Because Daddy Karp is a founder and one of two influencial arms of Plantir.  He is the negotiator for one side of american politics.

This matters because PLTR relies on large govt. contracts and MUST maintain a neutral political position.

It's other founder is Peter Thiel, or **Daddy Thiel.**  You might say he is a powerful man, and he handles the other side of american politics.

[Thiel is an extremely influential and powerful billionaire contrarian known for playing 3D chess and looking decades out...PLTR is his baby.](https://preview.redd.it/knpdewpcht571.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e83e232d334be4533531385d1ed5fe15e8297495)

&#x200B;

**Why does the govt. buy their software?**

Their software can take unbelievable amounts of video data, and give predictions on where enemies might attack, and various other events on a battlefield like it's a videogame.  The **CIA** helped them create their technology, and **SOCOM** just renewed a $300M a year contract with them.  These orgs. don't buy anything that doesn't work.

&#x200B;

[This shit looks like it's out of the movies, or a real time strategy game.  It works and it forms the backbone of US military operations.  It also transfers very well to the enterprise software space...](https://preview.redd.it/a3kgc5j2pq571.jpg?width=1555&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9680a8142d5345a5b694a4467cb2af3387e20f4)

This is just one use case; their engineers have been refining this tech for 17 years where they could create a secret moat.  In-fact, Peter Thiel himself has a book and has given speeches on the power of moats and ""not competing, but forming a monopoly.""  Zero to One.

**So why all this info?  It's critical to understand the facts I am about to present to you.**

With a ton of hype, and plenty of meme power, PLTR rose to past $40 a share earlier this year.

Most if not all did not truly understand how special the technology was, and it fell on FUD surrounding stock based compensation and Daddy Karp selling shares.  We will get to this FUD at the end.

W**hy it's special:**

**MOAT:  I see people say, ""it's just data analytics, anyone can compete with them."" no.**

This is like people saying, ""it's just an airplane copy it and it should fly great.""  An analytics platform that is able to ""gameify"" real world problems in real time and present solutions using integrated Ai/ML is a MASSIVE engineering problem.  Think, a ton of PHD level skilled engineers making the highest salaries in Tech.  So much, that they can retire after a few years if they want.  Now imagine them working for 17 years on something before any other company even thinks to start competing.  This is a bigger moat than many darlings of the tech world have in their software, such as TSLA, which had google, apple, etc. working on competing solutions for years.  And it has saved it's clients MILLIONS in Skywise.  For anyone in the software space; you know how brutal implementation is for SAP and similar platforms.  Often it's unsuccessful and expensive.  PLTR is already demonstrating PROFITABLE implementations.  This is a sign of a massive moat for anyone who understands the enterprise software world.

[This is just a summary of one application of PLTR's Skywise platform; built on Foundry.  They are going to do this to every industry; true prescriptive analytics with rapid deployment of a custom solution.  If you understand that, it's insane.  If you don't, ask a friend that is intelligent and knows about software.](https://preview.redd.it/eg2qwmim1r571.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=26b9bdc63c34c5ad1b0fab1bfafe473444e34ee6)

**Earnings Expectations:  They are Sandbagging Sons of Bitches**

Right now we are pricing Palantir at about 40X revenue as a SAAS company.  Their margins aren't the best as they continue to invest and maintain future monopoly status, but they are landing $300M govt. deals (SOCOM) and expanding that business which is EXTREMELY STICKY.

Their revenue growth officially is about 30% per year.

However, as all SAAS companies do, internally they have a goal/target of around 50% per year.  That is absolutely achievable, in fact a few large deals can accomplish this, AND MUCH MORE.  I would argue this in itself is sandbagging due to the potential size of their enterprise deals (just ONE big deal would annihilate that number) and they have been offering their product for literally less than a year now...

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[With two Daddy's like this, what could go wrong?  Why is PLTR hated by the media?](https://preview.redd.it/wuid619x4r571.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=998b2feb59674afacc6dad5b7217cbde56e98e0c)

**FUD:  What could go wrong, why has the stock dropped after it's meteoric rise?**

&#x200B;

1. **It's custom software! That's expensive, time consuming, hard to scale!  Companies won't buy it.**

SAP is horrible and it's implemented all the time, takes years to implement, costs HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to implement, and is often not successful.  It's actually a running joke in the enterprise software world.  Palantir has a history of successful implementations (it's custom but designed so low-code it can be developed and delivered quickly in any enterprise), a testament to the 17 years that Karp and Thiel spent training their team in high gravity (lul).  **This is like a SMART salesforce, which by the way, was the fastest growing software company IN HISTORY and is worth $400B now, and it has competition in the CRM space.  PLTR is the next evolution, and has ZERO competition.**

Salesforce was created to be a single source of truth in an enterprise.  Pltr takes that a step further by allowing you to simply plug in business units and allow it to act as your “sky net” and tell you what to do.  It literally is that incredible.  It’s true mass available prescriptive analytics, sprinkled across an entire company.

**Is it unreasonable to think the mkt cap of pltr could be a multiple of salesforce in the near future when it is the next evolution of data platforms, has no competition, and salesforce previously held the record for fastest growing software company in history?**

&#x200B;

**2.   Daddy Karp made the most of any CEO this year and he sold hundreds of millions of shares!**

The way he is paid, his Stock granted is income.  So he pays TAXES on it.  That means he has to sell shares just to cover the taxes so he doesn't go to federal prison.  The dude can't pay it any other way he doesn't have hundreds of millions of dollars laying around...he's spent 17 years building this as his baby.  This is all stupid media FUD because it makes awesome headlines and scares the shit out of boomers that aren't used to the financing around an insanely fast growing software company.  The numbers look crazy on the surface but make sense once you realize it's all because of the meteoric rise in the stock price.

**3.  They are compensating their employees with Stock! It Dilutes us!**

They are hiring the worlds best software engineer PHD Data Scientists to make sure their moat and monopoly doesn't even come close to being encroached on.  These people are expensive.  They continually train their models in their client's environments, without keeping their clients data, only evolving their own model.  This maintains privacy and creates momentum for their algorithm that makes it impossible to catch up to PLTR's Foundry.  Think google with their threatgraph for search.  They have too much data and too much time refining their algorithms for anyone to catch them in that category.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Price Targets:**

&#x200B;

[Holy Fucking Shit, look at that Q1 rev. growth despite being brand new to enterprise...](https://preview.redd.it/rkgyuszcuq571.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ea1be3ff5dbdbadd731a7ae8a69d94fcabe713)

If they grow at the internal, non-sandbagged rate they think they will hit **according to internal docs shared with public (google Q4 2020 PLTR business update, can't link).**

They will have $4B in revenue, in 4 years.  Imagine in 4 years, if a SAAS company was priced at just 10x Revenue with 50% + growth yoy....which will accelerate as proof of concept is demonstrated at large orgs.

**My price target is $80 EOY** because I believe at least one HUGE contract will roll in that will provide further proof of FOUNDRY as a concept and the impact will be undeniable.  Companies will be lining up to get Foundry and projected demand will show implied growth off the charts that no one has accounted for.  The Skywise project finalized my opinion on this, PLTR told them WHEN VALVES IN ENGINES WERE BEHAVING ODDLY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED PRIOR TO FAILURE, OPTIMALLY, TO SAVE MILLIONS A YEAR PER AIRLINE IN SCHEDULING AND OTHER COSTS you can read about that on another subreddit, the info is out there if you do a google search on skywise.

**Price target in 4 years: $500.**  Because I think revenue growth will be more like salesforce was as a necessary platform to enterprises.  This would give it a larger MKT cap than Salesforce.  **If this becomes a hyped meme to add fueld to the fire, it will accelerate beyond what we can even comprehend, TESLA style.  Just the US GOVT. alone will be TRILLIONS of dollars potentially as they are investing trillions in Ai software solutions over the next 20 years.**   [Forbes GSA Article 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/08/16/how-the-us-government-is-using-ai-to-help-procure-trillions-of-dollars-of-products-and-services-an-interview-with-keith-nakasone-gsa/?sh=22a1193670ac)  [2021 Article about AI spending push..$Trillions with PLTR as the clear leader](https://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2021/04/biden-budget-requests-major-investments-federal-technology-and-cybersecurity/173262/)

**if this happens....then.....**

**Possible Price Target with hype and diamond hands TSLA style = $1000** when everyone figures out this Stock is literally magic because it will be bigger than google.  It's data analytics and threat-graph will be more useful to smart money and BIG money than google and it will rule the world.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** Both Daddy's have spent 17 years using the most advanced govt. resources (U.S. DOD spends the most on R&D of any industry or company in the world...by FAR) to craft a secret Ai/ML platform that allows companies and Govts. to play Starcraft in real-life, with WALLHACKS on that tell them what their opponent is going to do, and what they need to do to stay competitive.  They released  at the perfect time by going public when it was ready to scale and unable to be dethroned.

**This software will be mandatory for most large companies just to be competitive.**

**My positions:** 25x 40C 366 DTE, 762 shares at $24.57.  This is my entire account, i've seen enough to be 100% sure I don't need to day or swing trade anymore.  That $11k avail is just margin, i'm out of cash, this is how it displays in the TDA-TOS app.  I'm all in on this.  I actually want more leaps but I only have $26 dollars left in cash so I will buy 1 more share.

&#x200B;

[Based on my positions and an addiction to optionsprofitcalculator.com, I will make millions if the $500 thesis comes true in the next year.  in fact, at this thesis approx. 25 leaps worth $6k right now would make someone a millionaire.  Is that worth the gamble to you?](https://preview.redd.it/5jkde0871r571.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ac3de19f0e926adfe500397910270389bbce4d1)

There stock based compensation HAS diluted us already this company. wont be going back to  40 for another 24months if not more. That spike was obviously cause pltr was a wsb meme at the peak of january.  Karp has already sold more stock for himself than the company is worth. The only Moat they have is that they get goverment contracts but investers have wanted to see them get commercial contracts since its a bigger market, Karp has already said he wont sell his software in any country that isnt a US ally so hes putting pltr into a niche, probably so he doesnt lose his us gov contracts. Theres 1.2B in float, unless this company 10X's its revenue its going to stay low, its traded as a growth stock so when the fed actualy does raise rates itl crater. 

If antone wanta to get in on pltr get in on its next inevitable drop to 20 in shares and forget you own it for five years. Its had a heavy put scew for momth because everyone thats bought call knows it cant hold anything above 25"

I'm a proud Palantard but statements like ""these groups don't buy stuff that doesn't work"" is a sweeping generality that is often untrue. Also, has OP seen federal acquisition from the inside? I have, and let me tell you the waste and inefficiencies would make your head spin. 

IMO, the real opportunity is increased use in the private sector in any number of industries that need business intelligence and enterprise governance. To OP's credit, in 5 years there will be competitive companies who have this, and everyone else who doesn't losing market share."
2021-06-17 14:06:59,wallstreetbets,"This has been said about every fast growing software company ever.  

Many analysts use wizardry to arrive at a price target of $500, or 1trillion market cap.

Keep in mind, My pricing is based on the belief they took those 17 years to develop the commercial offering while being funded by reliable govt contracts.

If that isn’t the case, then my entire thesis is fatally flawed and you would be correct.

However, there are indicators that I am right.  For example Thiels extreme consistency over time on long term strategic planning to establish a moat.  Zero to one is awesome, highly recommend reading.

They took the company public for a reason; it was ready for mass adoption finally.

This argument has of course been made against all growth companies, and sometimes it bears fruit.

All depends on the underlying thesis and vision, and here, I believe I am right.

Once a company gets on a platform and it transforms them, leaving it is painful and margins go through the roof for PLTR as they invest less in R&D."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What’s Bad for AMZN is good for WISH Yesterday, Lina Khan, a vocal critic of Amazon, was sworn in to lead the FTC at age 32. 

Khan played a crucial role as legal counsel for the House antitrust subcommittee’s 16-month investigation into the Big Tech giants, and in producing the 400-page House Democrat report that alleged that all of the tech giants engage in anti-competitive practices and need to be reined in.

Khan burst onto the scene in antitrust circles in 2017 when she penned a legal paper dubbed “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” which spread widely among proponents and critics alike.

The Federal Trade Commission also continues to probe various Amazon business practices to determine if Jeff Bezos’s corporation is violating antitrust laws.

Even if it wasn't pure shit, Wish is not a direct competitor to Amazon. Amazon's main selling point is convenience. You want something, it's at your door in 2 days or less. Wish's main selling point is low prices for stuff you don't really need. It's fun to go on Wish when you're drunk and spend £10 on a load of weird shit and then forget about it until they arrive in a couple of months. No one who actually needs anything buys it on Wish.

The key to shopping on WISH is user feedback with photos.

Don’t buy anything without this unless you want to gamble.

Sometimes sellers will post a photo much better than what they are actually selling.

If this happens, you only have to send wish a photo of what you received and tell them you were ripped off. They refund your original purchase method.

I always take time to review my purchases for this reason, and hope others will do the same.

I have read quite a few DD's regarding ITUB in the past 24 hours and few of them tried to pump it.**

# Welcome to the Unbiased ITUB DD

&#x200B;

**What is ITUB?**

*Banco Itaú Unibanco S.A. is a* *Brazilian* *financial services* *company headquartered in* *São Paulo*\*, Brazil. Itaú Unibanco was formed through the merger of\* *Banco Itaú* *and* *Unibanco* *in 2008. It is the largest banking institution in Brazil, as well as the* *largest in Latin America* *and in the* *Southern Hemisphere*\*, and the\* *seventy-first largest bank in the world*\*. It is also one of twenty most valuable banks in the world.\* [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ita%C3%BA_Unibanco)

&#x200B;

**What about Institutional ownership?**

*Institutional investors control 20.70% of the outstanding shares in ITUB. This is the highest percentage of ownership than at almost any other company in the Major Banks industry.*  [Source - CNN](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=ITUB&subView=institutional)

Top institutions are holding shares of ITUB. Here's the list : -

**Unusual options activity**

A whale purchased more than 100K contracts for 7$ strike expiring 7/16. The Whale's bet is already up by almost 50% after the purchase.

&#x200B;

**Why is this a good play?**

*Warren buffet is bullish Brazilian banks and has invested 500M$ in Brazilian Neobank Nubank. Source : -*[Entrepreneur](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/374489).

&#x200B;

* *In the past 10 -15 years, ITUB has generated some of the world's highest net interest margins and generated returns on equity more than 15%.*

&#x200B;

* *They came out with an announcement yesterday claiming that they plan to invest* ***R$400Billion*** *in green investments to promote a sustainable, increasingly greener and more inclusive economy. The main 3 fronts would be i) granting credit to energy, health, education and infrastructure services ii) structuring transactions for their clients such as Green Bonds, Sustainability bonds and iii) they would support and provide incentives to product manufacturers such as Hybrid cars, EV's, solar panels, microcredit etc.*

&#x200B;

* *Brazil has done terrible during pandemic but now that the vaccine is available to the entire world and lockdown mandates are getting lenient, the Brazilian economy is primed for rebound.*

2021-06-17 15:59:05,wallstreetbets,"Just a quick contribution from a local guy:  
Itau Unibanco is a Brazilian bank, and as such has most of its costs and revenue in BRL. ITUB is nothing more than the ADR of the real share traded here in Brazil, ITUB3 and ITUB4.  
I know you guys don't give half a fuck to fundamentals, but most of its appreciation in the last quarter came from BRL gaining ground over USD, it has little to do with the company. When you choose to buy it without properly FX hedging, you are basically selling the USD/BRL pair and buying the stock in BRL.  
Do whatever you want with this information."

2021-06-17 14:28:05,wallstreetbets," not going up in value, in the middle of a housing boom is what i consider a crash for a lending company

i was in since last nov @ 20.15   .. so i think thats before wsb hoopla.. not sure..dead as in .. lockdowns over , economy opening wide open, housing mrkts rolling,  and crickets out of rkt..  the pump was supposedly not a pump but more of a level up to a norm on an undervalued stock.. aparently it wasnt that over valued after all.  i saw potiential for rkt last summer. thinking when the shit-demic is over maybe it will take off, hind sight is 20/20, shoulda sold during the hoopla,,   at this point in time.. its dead to me.. i dont see any reason it would go much higher than $20-$30.. do you???      so yeah,, 7 months holding a stock and all it saw was a little spike for a few days because of wsb... its dead...to me anyway,,,  one would think an expected up ramp off the tail of the pandemic,,but naw,, its struggling to hold on to $20

and love your assumptions.. you make me laugh.. not everyone invests in wsb popular stocks. i do have AMC, didnt need a bunch of apes to put 2 and 2 together that people will start going back to the movies when the lockdowns are over,, thats a no brainer. however when i bought amc , i had no idea it was shorted into obvilion, i didnt even research anything, that i just bought because it seemed like easy money and it was only $4 /share, so i threw some money at it."

**JUNE 17, 2021**  10:00-10:45 a.m.

**THE TIME FOR NATURAL GAS IS NOW**

Heavy duty trucks total 5% of all vehicles on our roadways, but they account for 42% of all smog-forming transportation related greenhouse gases. Are ultra-low emission natural gas trucks a possible solution to this?

This presentation by **Chad Lindholm of Clean Energy Fuels** will delve into the technology, provide an overview of fueling with natural gas, and the many environmental and economic advantages this alternative fuel can provide.

I'm very anxious to see where it goes when the volume starts ramping up in 20 mins, but I'm sitting here cool as a cucumber about the movement so far. Given how much people have riding on Friday's close, as well as yesterday's weak movement, I'd be genuinely shocked if today is a low volume day."

 let’s be clear BlackBerry has been building a comprehensive, single source security platform for enterprises and government to use as the world evolves to digital everything notably in “communication” whereby one of object communicates with another object (IoT). Chen has built these products to where the market is going in the future not to where it is today. This takes patience and perseverance but w his cash cow patent portfolio he could do that. Product development complete so now sales and marketing in play. Nvda did this with their chips before it was needed. Their stock was under $10 like where BB has been the last 4!years. Now they are $650! BB could easily get there once the Main Street realizes that they don’t make phones (though they still license them), and Wall Street rewards them with proper multiples. Easy to $35 as even short seller Citron said 4 years ago and that was before Cylance and Ivy. Easy $100 by 12/31/21. TL:DR Much like AmC. It was at $12 now at $60 in 1 month"

2021-06-17 14:41:03,wallstreetbets,"BBoiz, if  BB closes above 15 tomorrow, there could be a possibility for a gamma squeeze due to all the volume of call options there. Last I checked, yesterday, the dark pool balance was in the -$200mils (someone correct me if I'm wrong). What I take from this is that, those calls aren't hedged for, but it would also require \~$2mil influx on the buy. Opinions?"

Or behold the tendies years from the Fomo returning?"

2021-06-17 19:48:53,wallstreetbets,">Wait til Monday night. (Not financial advice).  
>  
>Here is why.  
>  
>(1) Tomorrow we can expect massive short attacks on AMC as HF's are DESPERATE to get us to max pain. Max pain is actually $29 which is not going to happen legally, but if they can get it to $40 they could probably prevent any kind of potential squeeze. Still, there will be a fuckton of FOMO buyers if this keeps going, as once we hit 2:45 and RobinHood starts executing, we can expect a big push at 3:00 pm. This is what caused a squeeze last time. There are few or no SHARES for them to buy. So the price kept going up and up. Those NOT on Robinhood who, at 4:00 were even MORE ITM and crushed it as they too, executed. Without shares to buy, it kept going up and up and up. Problem is people with SHARES see this huge upward momentum and sell because they are paper handed bitches but I respect the taking profits to feed ya fam so I ain't mad.  
>  
>(2) Now, if you have been paying attention for the last MONTH, every MONDAY those MMs MUST buy shares on Monday to cover those executed stonks that executed on Friday. This means that Monday is ALMSOT ALWAYS GREEN and BY A LOT. Plus, as MM's have to buy shares, people who are shorting are NOT shorting because they know it's a bad bet when they have to buy shares for MM's so they generally ctfo. Monday could very well be a MASSIVE day for AMC.  
>  
>So, expect tomorrow to probably start out as a terrible red day as shorts are scared as f and will use every dark pool and illegal means to fuck us. But if the apes have enough in their piggy banks, they will buy the dip and push us into Tendie Town. Once 3:00pm hits and RH does it's fuckery, it will really be a massively volatile moment potentially setting us up for MASSIVE gains.  
>  
>Could we get fucked tomorrow? (not spreading FUD). Well I do expect a lot of options to unravel driving the price down. Illegal hedging that bought BOTH options and puts to create synthetic shares can also unravel altering the price. So it could seriously drop by $10 but, in my opinion, IF we can get the cash machine printing money, apes will drop their paychecks to cover the MM's unraveling of optoins and if we push $60.01 at 3:00 pm you could see some serious shit.  
>  
>Again, this is a casino. You could potentially lose everything or make a life changing win on Monday. I am not here to offer advice, I can only offer my opinion which, just like an anus, everyone has one. So take this with a grain of salt. I will be holding til Monday. If it moons Monday, then Tuesday I might alter my positions at that time.

2021-06-17 07:05:28,wallstreetbets,"Everyone is waiting for the stock markets reply to the feds news as the 2 day rule is in effect. The stock market is the #1 leading indicator 

A stronger dollar:

Although bad for exporting, it will lead to a massive influx of foreign investment which is also more debt but will significantly increase our gdp. It should lead to an uptick in consumer spending and lead to lowering inflation/prices due to a stronger purchasing bill and overall reduction in prices of commodities, metals, etc. 

It should create more jobs as costs of doing business goes down and increase wages. Manufacturing usually picks up as imports are cheaper and this creates jobs

But it can also lead to lower profit margins for companies as goods prices fall, profits fall- but based on inventory cutbacks combined with lagging retail sales mom and the fact it wasnt in line with changes in the average consumer’s income, inflation wasn’t exactly making everyone shop. 

Tourism is negatively affected, borrowers are more reluctant to take out loans due to higher interest rates although it is super small. Housing should pick back up as there should be more balance and not these volatile prices

And lastly precious metal prices can act as a reflection of consumer sentiment towards the U.S. dollar and its future. The higher the dollar combined with a lower gold price is usually the world’s sentiment towards the direction America is heading

God bless America 🇺🇸

It's because other gullible investors got sucked into it before you and they want you to rescue them.

Instead of joining them, learn from them and point and laugh like the rest of us do.  Be better.  Don't be a rube."

2021-06-17 14:43:46,wallstreetbets,Not sure about the gammas squeeze part but the daily short ratio has been over 20% over the last two weeks. I think if earnings are good this stock could explode to the upside.

2021-06-17 10:27:05,wallstreetbets,"That way all the puts/shorts are out of the money and have to buy shares at cost. So they lose money, buy the shares, and drive the price up."
2021-06-17 11:06:48,wallstreetbets,Honestly all of this is factssss
2021-06-17 12:55:23,wallstreetbets,I’d say yes but I’m retarded
2021-06-17 10:53:06,wallstreetbets,Depends on your motives. I like the stock so I’m loaded up on shares in hopes the calls tomorrow go in the money.
2021-06-17 10:56:34,wallstreetbets,"Well if those $13calls expire ITM that could trigger a gamma squeeze and CLNE should shoot up. 
But for that to happen people need to be buying shares now… so it depends"

2021-06-17 07:22:31,wallstreetbets,Only if you sell ;)
2021-06-17 11:51:09,wallstreetbets,Your kidding right. Half this sub is high on AMC rn…
2021-06-17 11:51:34,wallstreetbets,You're not scrolling down enough then because people are aping about AMC
2021-06-17 08:40:31,wallstreetbets,"Not setting for that low, holding till I get rich or homeless"
2021-06-17 10:32:10,wallstreetbets,Guess I just need a bigger account so I can Daytrade and clock out after 2 hours of work.
2021-06-17 09:00:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the same thing happen to me with AMC, I regretted selling before it launched.   I’m BB-holding like I don’t even have the stocks.  Won’t make the same mistake."
2021-06-17 08:54:32,wallstreetbets,Buy the dips and you’ll be able to afford as much lube as you heart can desire
2021-06-17 09:19:19,wallstreetbets,"Not at all. Hopefully you've got shares though, calls may be screwed. CLNE will see big gains over the coming months and foreseeable future given how much it has going for it. But the apes are too damn divided and none of them want to admit it. There's too many tickers flying around. We need to pick 2-3 and PUSH."
2021-06-17 09:17:45,wallstreetbets,"Do some research, it’s a great company with great profits to be made for years. This is early volatility and once meme craze dies in it I believe true value will show itself"

2021-06-17 11:00:44,wallstreetbets,Gme holders? 🤭
2021-06-17 12:40:24,wallstreetbets,"Ah, the classic CLNE after hours shenanigans.

2021-06-17 13:20:05,wallstreetbets,Depends what you're looking for. I'm holding long after I sell some off when it's $20-$30 probably. Has great prospects short and long.
2021-06-17 08:12:34,wallstreetbets,Zoom out lol
2021-06-17 09:03:22,wallstreetbets,It realistically just has to stay above 40
2021-06-17 10:19:37,wallstreetbets,Yes till EOD tomorrow
2021-06-17 19:35:31,wallstreetbets,Shorts don't mean shit unless you have millions of people and a bunch of whales backing your play to drive prices up and you don't have that with CLOV. You don't realize that GME and AMC took months to build up support with their own subs before the prices started mooning and the people believe in it enough not to sell at the first sign of a crash. Maybe CLOV is legit but it got caught up in the memestock hype and all that's left is a bunch of bagholders hoping they can make it the next GME or AMC when GME and maybe AMC aren't even finished yet.
2021-06-17 19:34:50,wallstreetbets,I own all 5.  Stay strong bro.

2021-06-17 06:31:23,wallstreetbets,You ain't fucked.  The only thing those idiots are getting wrong is that they think it's some kind of quick squeeze play.  It's why it's the first stock that gets paper handed when they finally figure out it's not going to jump 70% in a pre-market.  Hold the shares for a year or so and you'll be good.
2021-06-17 06:31:59,wallstreetbets,All in as well. I’m not worried though.

2021-06-17 14:03:54,wallstreetbets,"After CLOV dropped following that huge spike on the 7th it hasn't really done much but go down in value very slowly but steadily. I think this is making a lot of people hesitant to jump on it because they're concerned that spike was a one-time thing. Don't get me wrong, I'm also in CLOV (not balls deep, mind you) because I think it has potential, but based on volume and price action alone, the stock doesn't have too much curb appeal.

At least that's my two cents. I'm also an idiot so I'm probably wrong."

2021-06-17 07:13:59,wallstreetbets,"The stock offering that happened when the price was high had been announced for a while but I think majority of people never researched the company before dumping their money in and were shocked by it. The next one has already been announced too but it wont happen for a while. The majority of the attraction def is from the squeeze potential but also the reopening potential/new movies coming out/it being summer. They used a ton of money to lower their debts to be a more fundamentally attractive company as well so theyr'e headed in the right direction for sure. Its def not a super long term hold and with the digitization of media, they wont really flourish unless they branch out but in the short term, I like the stock."
2021-06-17 07:10:56,wallstreetbets,He has a plan. It’s called “A Hope and a Prayer”.
2021-06-17 07:11:52,wallstreetbets,CEO said  additional shares issued at the inflated prices can be used to help takeover failing theatres to expand market share. Use it to pay the disgusting debt levels. Aside from those they haven't given any guidance I'm aware of

2021-06-17 08:18:14,wallstreetbets,I am voting against more shares.... don't need more shares for shorts to use to cover.... talk to me again once it's over 1000 and then we will talk about issuing more shares.
2021-06-17 08:24:45,wallstreetbets,I am voting no on AMC issuing more shares. AA wants to bankrupt the company.

2021-06-17 12:47:42,wallstreetbets,"People are hoping for the last push above $60-62, where they think a lot of OTM calls due tomorrow will become ITM, leading to some sort of gamma squeeze again.

What do you think will happen if that doesn't happen tomorrow?"
2021-06-17 12:45:01,wallstreetbets,Common sense isn't completely gone yet. What a miracle.
2021-06-17 10:29:14,wallstreetbets,Never sell right in the morning. Or buy for that matter. I always give it an hour before I do anything because I've been burned doing both right at market open.
2021-06-17 10:28:41,wallstreetbets,Buy $BB ???
2021-06-17 09:47:05,wallstreetbets,its top 3 mentioned BB gets talked about constantly good and bad so it in here.
2021-06-17 08:17:14,wallstreetbets,GME ruining the subreddit still doesn’t make it fit the criteria of this thread. Needs to be top 3 mentioned.
2021-06-17 08:36:39,wallstreetbets,"Much worse bags to be holding. It might not rocket but it's seeing steady, huge growth and the sector doesn't seem to be slowing down. It's just in a consolidation phase."

2021-06-17 09:15:53,wallstreetbets,No ones giving up it’s a red day chill apparently you weren’t around for GME
2021-06-17 09:12:16,wallstreetbets,What you think it is going to go higher?  A 6000% increase wasn't enough?  lol.

2021-06-17 10:50:05,wallstreetbets,There's an insane gamma ramp for CLNE at $13.
2021-06-17 10:49:28,wallstreetbets,Gamma not short lol
2021-06-17 10:50:36,wallstreetbets,"Earlier this month, all of the calls for CLNE were only up to 13 dollars. So there are a ton of people with calls at the 12 and 13 dollar mark."
2021-06-17 10:52:06,wallstreetbets,Fundamentals my man
2021-06-17 10:51:14,wallstreetbets,Gamma… exactly it’s because it’s a solid play
2021-06-17 12:49:18,wallstreetbets,You are just impatient tbh
2021-06-17 07:05:19,wallstreetbets,No point advertising that here. Let it play out slowly. It will do fine either way.
2021-06-17 06:45:00,wallstreetbets,Shhhh don’t tell anybody yet
2021-06-17 15:14:04,wallstreetbets,that was because they turned off trading.  Will not happen this time

2021-06-17 17:18:37,wallstreetbets,"For BB, gotta watch that $14.02 level - $770k influx needed on the buy side to blast through it. If we break that, then we regain some support above $14 and break a big psychological level."

2021-06-17 09:39:36,wallstreetbets,"This sub is more for making stupid decisions, like not selling AMC when it was at $64 (twice!), while holding out hope for wackadoo theories about $100k per share. Because going from $2 -> $64 on a popcorn business is not a squeeze, somehow."
2021-06-17 15:33:57,wallstreetbets,0% chance this thing hits $13 tomorrow.. any time it gets any momentum it’s instantly stifled

2021-06-17 15:57:32,wallstreetbets,Someone sounds salty because people are buying a stock other than their pet stock (AMC).
2021-06-17 15:57:36,wallstreetbets,Not even true. I just clicked on 6 and only 1 had an account under 1 year old
2021-06-17 16:16:38,wallstreetbets,My account is 4 years old and i fucking love CLNE lmao
2021-06-17 15:57:17,wallstreetbets,"Come on man, don't be like that. Don't generalize all of us. We all here trying to make money. Who gives a duck how old their account is if they're not bots? WSB is now a hedge fund and this hedge fund needs capital. That capital = more apes. I welcome all

CLNE usually does cool things the day after it overcomes its natural tendency to bleed every afternoon.

Might additional hypothetical piling-on today - albeit on a smaller scale than earlier - be effective?"

2021-06-17 19:38:40,wallstreetbets,I agree 100% but gme and amc have showed us the way and I believe CLOV is just beginning. But I very well could be wrong.
2021-06-17 08:50:05,wallstreetbets,That’s what I like to hear!

2021-06-17 13:44:27,wallstreetbets,He updated his top comment in the main post. He’s holding till tomorrow.
2021-06-17 12:49:45,wallstreetbets,It’ll trickle back down because of “diamond hands” or whatever. Wont be a sudden drop but won’t be good. I am surprised more folks haven’t taken $60 as a major Win and sold off but I guess when you expect to become a millionaire off your 3 shares of a stock with half a billion in float you don’t really think that much about profit
2021-06-17 10:31:40,wallstreetbets,Yes buy BB
2021-06-17 09:16:18,wallstreetbets,I taught the squeeze has not happened yet.... Heggies still have not covered.

2021-06-17 15:00:17,wallstreetbets,I'm not holding though. Made 50k in a week on buying and selling AMC :) screwed up on BB big time though. Should have sold earlier and bought AMC at 47
2021-06-17 13:39:31,wallstreetbets,Should I set a buy at 60?

2021-06-17 17:25:57,wallstreetbets,"No, there's no psychological thing. When BB opens in the morning in foreign markets, the price will be unrelated to what happens now. It's based on the opening auction."

They have innovative healthcare AI, huge backers like Chamath, 700 million cash on hand, medium term trend lines heading towards $20, and almost no debt. How is this a scam?

2021-06-17 13:19:39,wallstreetbets,"The price is wrong. People yoloing into AMC cause they can afford it, and the echo chamber of bots.

The CEO is compromised, they have no plan to pivot into any new industries, they have no fundamentals, they keep diluting the shares, the float is too big, it was shorted 80%, not over 100%.

The media keeps pushing it as a distraction and to run cover for the HFs.  They are going to crash this stock with no survivors."

2021-06-17 07:56:47,wallstreetbets,"That's a fair assumption. All those hourly P&Ds the last two weeks make me turn on this sub as well. Only reason I'm here is CLNE. And that happened as I was one of those believers before the gamma hype started. 

It just is hard to find proper new investment ideas here and that's sad. That being said, make your own DD and find same red herrings before FOMO'ing into new ""hypes"", in particular if they come out of nowhere (""who let the dogs out?""). Just a few days ago this was all over this place only to not be heard of."

Would be nice to have a nice holiday for all going forward lol, just not tomorrow"
2021-06-17 17:29:30,wallstreetbets,"To each their own, it's definitely a strong move if it breaks past $14 here though. I'd agree it's not as strong as intraday, but it's better than stagnating.

Foreign markets even worse than US AH. Every time I look at BB in germany, it's always like 4,000 shares traded."

Buy a lotto for cheap and some shares. this looks so strong and if we break the 25# 26k share wall we are rocketing to the fucking MOON.  
PLTR pay attention to this one today. Short borrow rate went from .25% to 4.61%, we have 120k OI in $25-$26 strike and they are shorting as much as possible to stop it from squeezing. I think this puppy has the potential, grab some shares and a lotto call imo...but this can go insaneeee  
look at what happened wednesday. Theres a reason it didn't break out yet, they NEED these contracts to expire worthless. Delta for $25 call is only .3877 at current, when we hit 25.50 earlier 21M shares traded to hold us down. Delta would massively increase if we push back up there, with MMs being forced to either short more (which is now becoming harder as shares are less avail and more expensive) or buy to hedge which will squeeze the already shorted shares. Its kinda wild but its happened so many times and PLTR really is next if we have even a SLIGHT push"

2021-06-17 06:34:57,wallstreetbets,Made 200k from 10k last year with organised trading and everyone I tell is quick to pass it off as gambling or luck. It's as if in most people's minds the only approved way of making money is through wage slavery.
2021-06-17 13:21:26,wallstreetbets,"**(I know this is annoyingly long and fucking up your /new experience, I'll unsticky it after it gets some commentary)**

Ok, I hear you guys memeing about ""zomg everything is a hedgie pump and dump"" and ""REEEEE BOTS"".

We've always had an issue with enforcing anti-pump-and-dump rules because it is not clear when those things are actually happening. I don't want to just send 20 mods out to ""use their judgment"" on everyone's DD post. It'll be a nightmare.

Let me give you an example, probably the clearest example of nefarious activity that I've ever seen here, and ask you what you would do about it:

Some guys made a discord to pump CLNE. They posted a few DDs here, a few memes, and upvoted DDs from other people. I banned the usernames I saw involved and nuked their posts when I joined the discord on a tip the other day.

What do you do about that? Do you assume all of the other people talking about CLNE are also shills? Why? Why not? There are hundreds of thousands of other people here. 

What do you do when the issue is not so clear and you don't have a discord room telling you exactly who is a shill and who isn't? Do we ban anyone who posts in other market subs? Do we ban people workshopping DDs with a couple of people (if we even catch it) before posting? Do I listen to the apes and just ban everything that isn't GME because *obviously* it's a hedgie shill plot to prevent the MOASS?

**What do you want to see as objective criteria to prevent these things?** Should we even care if some other subreddit wants to post DD here? Should we just cultivate an attitude of being skeptical of DDs and grilling OPs? I don't want to allow any nefarious activity here, but I also don't want to salem witch hunt every DD and spend even more of my time when people are just gonna be unhappy with tomorrow's issue du jour anyway and forget all about this once the meme dies out.

You should assume all DD is by someone who wants you to spend your money on an equity they're probably already in. You should assume that any community whose popularity is above a certain threshold is going to be seen as a target for people wanting to share information to their advantage. To what extent do you really want us being the DD nannies, under what criteria **specifically**, and would you actually stop memeing about hedgies and bots if we did it?

We care, this just is not some ""wave a magic wand and fix it"" issue. I think our biggest problem is people's attitudes, being willing to carry water for conspiracies about bots and hedgies, not a bunch of shills from other subreddits. Please do not mindlessly contribute to the destruction of this community when you have no suggestions on how to fix it, or proof that it's even broken.

What do? Thoughts? Criteria on what is shill DD that is so specific that I can program it?"

2021-06-17 09:58:29,wallstreetbets,"Last update on PLTR before we hit 25.50-27-30... We are breaching 25$ now, there are SO MANY CONTRACT (over 60k+!!!) at this strike alone. Push this shit and we are gamma squeezing so hard. See below:

&#x200B;

PLTR watch this here, update we are now rocketing with volume and about to push 25$ area. Above 25.50 and we gamma squeeze to fuck. Buy a lotto for cheap and some shares. this looks so strong and if we break the 25# 26k share wall we are rocketing to the fucking MOON.  
PLTR pay attention to this one today. Short borrow rate went from .25% to 4.61%, we have 120k OI in $25-$26 strike and they are shorting as much as possible to stop it from squeezing. I think this puppy has the potential, grab some shares and a lotto call imo...but this can go insaneeee  
look at what happened wednesday. Theres a reason it didn't break out yet, they NEED these contracts to expire worthless. Delta for $25 call is only .3877 at current, when we hit 25.50 earlier 21M shares traded to hold us down. Delta would massively increase if we push back up there, with MMs being forced to either short more (which is now becoming harder as shares are less avail and more expensive) or buy to hedge which will squeeze the already shorted shares. Its kinda wild but its happened so many times and PLTR really is next if we have even a SLIGHT push"

Sell 6/18 SPY 421c @ 1.5 (current high)

You just made initial investment+30 dollars back in your pocket and can probably close this spread tomorrow for another 100

It also has admitted that it has no experience or capacity to produce EV vehicles. The whole contract bidding process was rigged, and they are going down in court. Just look at their stock today,  swirling in the bowl. 

The Biden admin wants a 100% EV fleet. No way is USPS going to be sticking with this garbage contract for a gasoline-powered fleet. $WKHS has filed in court to overturn the bullsh\*t corrupt contract, and had its first appearance today. I like the stock and bought more on the dips. It's American-made EV, it's the future, it's what the administration wants, and I believe it's going to happen. Yeehaw. (Not financial advice.

So basically what I'm saying is $CLF being down 7% is absolute horse shit and there is no way in hell this doesn't trade higher tomorrow and next week. $25 by next friday."

2021-06-17 13:34:08,wallstreetbets,"FUBO DD 🚀🌕🦍🦍🦧

Ok Apes we got another one to get behind and it’s FUBO! To appease the crowd I’ll put a shit load of rockets and moons toward the bottom with a TLDR so feel free to skip (if you are truly retarded) but for my Autists here is the thesis.

FUBO is a relatively young company at only 6 years old. It has been growing by leaps and bounds over that time frame with its core offering of linear TV with a sports focus for cord cutters and with under 1M subs it has a TON of room to run and you are certainly not late to the party. It has been firing on all cylinders with growth already over 100%+ on all metrics (ARPU, Advertising, subscribers). 

That said, with a $4.1B market cap, I see some serious expansion ahead of us. 

Catalysts / differentiators -
1. They have rolled out their free to play gaming earlier this month for the World Cup called “FanView” that gives in game stats as well as interactive questions and games you can play. This is critical to their ultimate goal of sports betting. The idea is teach users to interact for free and once they are used to the interactive aspects, you can take bets directly from your TV.

2. Sports betting. As recently as yesterday Fubo has been pushing its way into the gaming arena with the appointment of Carl Sottosant to their board from Penn National Gaming. This is on top of their partnership with Caesar’s Palace to run the sports book going live in ~Q4.

3. MORE SHORT INTEREST THAN AMC. 21% SI vs 20.5% (0.5% is still more so fuck you!) so if you want the next mega gamma beta fuck the system / hedgies squeeze hasn’t been squoze this is for you you beautiful retarded 🦍! 

TLDR: with a low relative valuation ($4.1B) growing at over 100% on all major metrics with a giant short interest. This is the most autistic play out there. With free to play out now and gambling coming.. get in before launch. 

As promised here are a bunch of emojis

2021-06-17 09:23:34,wallstreetbets,"PLTR pay attention to this one today. Short borrow rate went from .25% to 4.61%, we have 120k OI in $25-$26 strike and they are shorting as much as possible to stop it from squeezing. I think this puppy has the potential, grab some shares and a lotto call imo...but this can go insaneeee  


look at what happened wednesday. Theres a reason it didn't break out yet, they NEED these contracts to expire worthless. Delta for $25 call is only .3877 at current, when we hit 25.50 earlier 21M shares traded to hold us down. Delta would massively increase if we push back up there, with MMs being forced to either short more (which is now becoming harder as shares are less avail and more expensive) or buy to hedge which will squeeze the already shorted shares. Its kinda wild but its happened so many times and PLTR really is next if we have even a SLIGHT push"

Going down with the ship Titanic style with my call for SPY430 EOW

Steel, Copper, Precious Metals will have a good run. X to 27.75 EOD

Pre-Market Fake Out on Financials with Drill Team Six standing by awaiting orders

TSLA to 615 EOD and 620EOW, Elon gets into it with Burry on TWTR.

Inflation is expected to climb over the summer as industries struggle to catch up with the surge in demand as the economy reopens.
While prices may rise in the near term, it is expected to be temporary as manufacturers, retailers, and service providers ramp up their businesses.
Markets already expect rising inflation and prices reflect those expectations.
Investors should also know that the rate of inflation is expected to be in the range that has been helpful for equities historically.


In other words, HOLD AND BUY THE DIP"

Can everyone read this again. And then once more. Why the fuck would ANYONE openly push for others to invest in something they aren't also invested in? Of course DD is biased, they also want to make money, but it's up to you as the investor/gambler/retard to determine what is good for you to spend your money on. 

We don't need to handhold people losing thousands on shitty investments, we've all made them too. And learned. And made them again (and again).

If DD seems sus, Call it out. Ask questions. Lots of DD gets shut down right away around here because of a few small things. People just need to actually do more research than ""I saw like 7 posts about $ZJZ, I'm all in. Deep."""

If people from other subs are posting DD here on a specific company with good potential and fundamentals that is completely fine. The problem with short squeeze potential DD's is it basically gives an excuse to ignore all the underlying fundamentals of the company just to pump it to the wsb crowd. I think that's where the line should be drawn."

It’s a free market

Everyone who posts DD is already in. Does 20 people working on a DD make it any worse than if a hedge fund were to take a 10mm position and then release information about it to entice other buyers?

As long as people aren't literally making shit up or spamming the board in a way that degrades it, is it really a pump and dump?

I need some objective criteria as to what we're trying to prevent that is more verbose than ""sus shit"" and ""pumps"" so I can really sink my teeth into the issue. I'll program whatever we can come up with, or get the other mods on board. but... what do? What is the actual problem if the information isn't false?"

UCO went from $400/share down to $2 when the lockdowns happened. I likely wouldn't buy in now since I don't have the cash to buy in to already ""expensive"" stocks.

I did just buy Hertz though. They've been cleared to come out of bankruptcy and have gone from $1 to $8/share. With the pandemic lifting and people traveling again, I think they can only go up."
2021-06-17 17:07:25,wallstreetbets,"Oil doesn’t have the advantage of scientific breakthrough. There will be no tech that can revolutionize the efficiency of oil. Like the dude said, short term volatility. Best of luck trading oil."

2021-06-17 05:34:58,wallstreetbets,"After fellow WISH apes shared about Gamma Squeeze, I was curious and look up on the definition:

>The gamma squeeze happens when the underlying stock's price begins to go up very quickly within a short period of time. As more money flows into call options from investors, that forces more buying activity which can lead to higher stock prices.

Which based on the Open Interest of 18th June Options:

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/WISH/options/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/WISH/options/)

What about WISH as a company itself?

>WISH Business model is inverting Amazon’s strategy, whereby most of their products are unbranded, sold by various small businesses directly to consumers.- The #1 shopping app in 42 different countries- The #1 downloaded shopping app in the U.S. in 2017- Valued at about $8.5 billion with more than $1 billion in revenue in 2017

What about the buyout rumors?

>Remember Amazon in 2015 had offered $10 billion in cash for Wish — and Wish walked.  
>  
>Everyone we've spoken with agrees. Alibaba and Amazon have had acquisition talks with Wish in the past year.  
>  
>One person close to top players at Wish says Amazon recently offered $10 billion in cash to buy the company, and Wish's CEO walked away.  
>  
>Another person who's friendly with top Wish people said they'd heard the $10 billion rumor as well, but that number may actually reflect a new valuation Wish is raising at, not an acquisition offer.

TLDR;If $12.50 Calls printed on 18th June 2021.

It will probably gamma squeeze those naked calls and shorts.

Short sellers in this stock are extremely greedy! Driving down the stock price to a ridiculous level.  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)"

2021-06-17 08:59:09,wallstreetbets,"So delta is the rate of change in option value relative to a $1 change in stock price. Positive delta (calls) means when stock price goes up, call value goes up. Negative value (puts) means when stock price goes up, put value goes down. If delta is .20 (sometimes called ""20 delta"") that means a $1 change in stock price will increase option value by $.20, all else being equal. Market makers sell options to option buyers to help provide liquidity, and to minimize their risk, they take the other side of the trade using shares. For example, a MM sells a 40 delta call, leaving them short 40 delta, so they would have to buy 40 shares (each of 1 delta) to be delta-neutral. If the stock goes up $5 the option value would go up .4*5 = 2 so $200, which would be a $200 loss for the MM that sold the option, but they own 40 shares each of which increased $5 so they ""made"" $200 which leaves them with no net profit or loss.

This of course ignores that delta can change. ITM options and ATM options have a much higher delta than OTM options. But OTM options have a high gamma. Gamma is the rate of change of DELTA relative to stock price. So if stock price increases by $1 delta increases option value by $.4 and maybe gamma increases delta by .05. This ""accelerates"" the delta. If the new delta is 45, market makers would have to buy 5 extra shares to remain delta neutral.

Therefore you can see how many options going from OTM to ATM or ITM will increase the delta of those options significantly, and as the move occurs market makers will have to purchase shares to remain delta neutral, accelerating the stock's move upward. Note: the same can happen in reverse as MMs can offload or short shares in a scenario where we are talking about writing puts instead of calls, but this happens less often.

Hope that helps!"

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RNG production, a high margin activity thanks to public incentives, $CLNE focus Good morning everyone,

this DD will be focused more on the RNG production business. First some history on $CLNE and then the reason why **Total**, **BP**, **Chevron**, and **Enbridge** (among the largest groups) are looking at this magic fuel.

Please have a look at my other posts before reading this one:

* [Biomethane / RNG general business case](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsbfm1/biomethane_renewable_natural_gas_why_it_deserves/)
* [Biomethane / RNG potential if compared with Hydrogen & BEVs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nthp3b/dd_rng_potential_if_compared_with_hydrogen_bevs/)
* [Biomethane / RNG legislative focus in the infrastructure plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvgvpc/clean_energy_for_america_act_to_favor_net_zero/)
* [Biomethane / RNG to achieve clean air in California](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0zwrj/california_natural_gas_vehicles_partnership/)

$CLNE used to produce in-house its RNG but was forced [to sell the facilities to BP back in 2017](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clean-enrgy-fuel-m-a-bp-biomethane-idUSKBN1684C5), for $155 million. As part of the deal at the time, $CLNE signed a long-term contract to purchase biomethane from BP. The decision for $CLNE was due to a desperate need of cash, as at the time the company was still recovering after the massive oil price collapse, and the natural gas trucks business proposal relied mostly on the diesel-natural gas spread (which after the OPEC increase of supply became extremely unfavorable). Add into the equation the blistering Tesla narrative, and the disaster is complete.

After the sale, $CLNE became a de-facto distributor, that is, a very low margin business mostly dependent on commodities price oscillation.

Demand for natural gas kept rising over the quarters and in October 2018, $CLNE asked BP [to increase the RNG supply agreement](https://bioenergyinternational.com/biogas/bp-and-clean-energy-reach-agreement-to-increase-rng-supply). In February 2019, $CLNE set the goal [to offer zero carbon RNG at all of its fuelling stations by 2025](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-sustainability-goals-outline-road-to-100-renewable-zero-carbon-fuel-20-years-ahead-of-californias-electric-grid). Even if today RNG seems to be essential for the success of an energy company, at the time the market was not so happy for the announcement. RNG distribution margins are lower than the ones of fossil natural gas.

The company was likely aware of this and tried to increase margins with the zeronow program, which linked the price of fuel for leased trucks to the diesel price, minus an appealing fixed sum per gallon. The program took more than expected to take off and was not able to affect margins considerably.

This is part of the reason why after [the first UPS announcement in May 2019](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/release-archive/ups-makes-largest-purchase-of-renewable-natural-gas-ever-in-the-u-s) the share price was not able to hold its gains.

In 2019, markets and policymakers were not able to weigh properly the amazing characteristics of RNG. Hydrogen narrative was still in its infancy (after more than two decades of losses) and again the storytelling ability of Musk with the Tesla SEMI made everyone ignore RNG. The analyst of Raymond James (that kept a neutral rating on $CLNE for most of the share price from $2 to $20) used to mention BEV trucks and buses during earning calls, favoring these solutions and ignoring the environmental benefits of RNG.

# How RNG is made, and why is it a magic fuel?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tjc8ejpq3s571.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=b547b16391903143cec0a6917db843e3def1ba9d

RNG can be produced from landfills or wastewater facilities, or from farming operations waste (manure and some minor organic compounds). The first source is the reason why [Waste Management is so keen on RNG](https://mediaroom.wm.com/waste-management-unveils-30-million-renewable-natural-gas-rng-facility-in-louisville-kentucky/), and garbage trucks mostly run on RNG. The second one instead will be the main focus of $CLNE (and its partners)'s efforts, because it is the one with the lowest **CARBON INTENSITY** according to the California Air Resource Board.

&#x200B;

[From $CLNE website](https://preview.redd.it/0mikl7uv4s571.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=0365000bad2d524e976859f6ae91ecfb1aa0d9a8)

Within an RNG facility, Gas emissions from farming operations do not leak into the atmosphere. Therefore, the 30x global warming effect of methane, if compared with CO2, is avoided. The very same methane burnt in a ICE will still show a positive global warming balance as the CO2 from the tailpipe emissions will have a 1/30x effect if compared with the collected natural gas.

&#x200B;

# RNG production potential & margins

From the $CLNE Q1-2021 earnings call, we know that there are from five to seven billion gallons of dairy RNG available annually and that according to management, it is going to take from 5 to 10 years to bring it online at the cost of **$50 billion to $70 billion**. From the same call, we know that in the USA 35 billion of diesel are consumed annually. Please note that $CLNE sells less than 100 million gallons per quarter, with 560 fueling stations in operations.

On the margin side, it is good to have a look at the question of Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse, during the same Q1-2021 earnings call:

**Manav Gupta** (*Credit Suisse): I actually wanted to quickly focus on the upstream (RNG production) versus downstream (RNG distribution) profitability here. So let's say you have a company-owned station and let's say you believe it's giving you $0.30 to $0.35 a gallon. What I'm trying to understand is, is this Amazon deal giving you the volumes to develop the low CI RNG through your upstream partners and the profitability over there is 5$to $7 a gallon. So if you split that half way, that's like* ***$3 a gallon***\*. So it doesn't really matter if on a downstream basis you make $0.30 a gallon or $0.40 a gallon, the real benefit of this deal is that now you can go back to your partners, Total, BP and others, develop the upstream RNG, which is like $3 a gallon. So the real benefit will come from the upstream side on the margin, not really the downstream side. Can talk about that?\*

**Robert M. Vreeland** *(CFO): Well, Manav, yes, and no. I mean, there's value on both, but you're absolutely correct that the demand that's created from a deal like this just completely supports our position on the upstream supply side. Because, look, I mean, after all, the upstream is being developed with the intent of putting it into -- to get the highest value to put it into vehicles, heavy duty vehicles. And so when you come to the table where you have that and you have that demand, then it's a pretty powerful upstream proposition. Not to mention the economics that then flow into the upstream, which is separate from that $0.30, $0.35 you mentioned. That would be, in our case, would be in the joint venture. Now we will have those economics to the extent that we are the producer and we're using the gas from ourselves. But we'll have to get it from other sources as we*ll.

**Andrew J. Littlefair** *(CEO):  Manav, we also -- just on the source side, I don't want those on the call to think, well how are these guys going to develop all this RNG? We -- because we are the sort of the choke point with the infrastructure and have the largest network, we already take RNG for 40 different sources. And that grows all the time. And it will -- that will continue to grow. But Manav, you're right, the upstream is very profitable. But don't underestimate the value of the downstream per gallon. And don't -- and what I say, go back and look at my buildup, and you might be surprised that at a station that we own, our margin is better than what you're thinking.*

It seems then that management confirmed the educated guess of the analyst, which is around $3 of gross margins per gallon from the RNG production, against $0.40 from the RNG distribution. The reason why management underlined that also the distribution side of the business has potential, may be related to the fact that the current network operates at 50% capacity, thus average fixed costs will go down when the number of gallons will increase (source Q4 conference call transcript).

**RNG PRODUCTION & DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS OF $CLNE**

**Truck adoption, leasing programs partnerships**

On the truck adoption at ports, $CLNE is favored by [the recent decision of the LA Long Beach authorities decision](https://www.porttechnology.org/news/port-of-long-beach-exempts-natural-gas-vehicles-from-clean-truck-fund-rate/), which will equate treatment of Natural Gas trucks with BEV ZERO-emissions ones. Please note that there are more than 16'000 trucks operating at this port, and as of Q2 900 trucks should be natural gas ones (6% market share). As a reminder, $CLNE annual revenue depends on around 48'000 Heavy-duty vehicles (bus and trucks).

The company is working with Chevron and recently upsized the program with an additional $20 million leasing support from the oil company (total program equal to **$28 million**). This is the timeline of the $CLNE & Chevron partnership:

* July 2020, [Chevron Partners with Clean Energy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-partners-clean-energy-adopt-100000710.html) on Adopt-a-Port Initiative to Reduce Emissions
* May 2021, [Chevron, Clean Energy Fuels extend Adopt-a-Port initiative](https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-clean-energy-fuels-extend-adopt-a-port-initiative-to-reduce-emissions) to reduce emissions

$CLNE was active with Total too on the trucks' adoption side of the business ([the zeronow program mentioned earlier](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-launches-zero-now-financing-put-fleets-clean-new-natural-gas-trucks-price-diesel-truck)), with a **$100 million** fire capacity, launched in July 2018.

**RNG production**

At the moment, on the RNG production side of the business, $CLNE has partnerships with the following companies:

* $CLNE [& TOTAL JV](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-and-total-sign-joint-venture-to-develop-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure): announced in March 2021, is a 50/50 partnership with an initial commitment of **$100 million** and can increase to **$400 million** as development opportunities progress. In addition,  Total will be providing credit support for Clean Energy development in the RNG value chain, including $45 million for contracted RNG fueling infrastructure. Please note that the JV exposure can be larger than the funded amount due to leverage.
* $CLNE [& BP JV](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-and-bp-create-jv-to-invest-in-rng-fuel-production): each company will retain 50% of the votes, but BP will fund **$50 million** and $CLNE will fund **$30 million.**

Please note that Chevron established partnerships on its own to set up RNG production facilities:

* In September 2020, [CalBio, Dairy Farmers and Chevron announced their RNG JV](https://www.chevron.com/stories/calbio-dairy-farmers-and-chevron-announce-first-rng).
* In December 2020, [Chevron and Brightmark](https://www.waste360.com/waste-energy/chevron-and-brightmark-forge-ahead-four-dairy-rng-projects) are partnering to build and own four projects in multiple states to produce RNG.
* In February 2021, [Chevron and Brightmark](https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-brightmark-expand-partnership-on-dairy-biomethane-fuel-projects) expand the previously announced partnership.
* In June 2021, Chevron announces to rebrand or [open more than 30 CNG retail sites](https://csnews.com/chevron-rebrand-or-open-more-30-cng-retail-sites-2025).

It seems clear that with $3 of gross margin per gallon the opportunity for $CLNE and its partners is huge. If just 25% of the distributed RNG is going to be produced in-house, it will represent a $300 million windfall for the company. This may help to understand why analysts' target prices are higher than today's price. **Although it is important to note that RNG plants require time to come online (from 9 to 15 months) therefore I think that we will see the first effect on the company's guidance later in 2022**.

2021-06-17 06:24:25,wallstreetbets,"I cannot read the other comments, about the one who asked if clne is a distributor or a producer:

It was both until 2017, then now with the JVs with TOTAL and BP it will become a producer again

u/busybill3736"
2021-06-17 08:46:07,wallstreetbets,"Great insights. You earned a doctorate in CLNE and RNG.

Several stupid questions:

1. Is it the goal of CLNE to lead the way in replacing diesel as the main source of fuel for the trucking industry? If so, what is the timeline for when this can be accomplished?
2. You said that the US annual sales of diesel amounts to 35B (gallons right?) with RNG production being about 1/5th that, right? So CLNE sells about 0.4B gallons, or around 5% of total RNG produced? Do you have a list that shows the a ranking of the top sellers of RNG and their totals ($ and gallon amounts)? 5% seems a little low ... Is it that the producers are accumulating unsold RNG inventory because the infrastructure can't fully handle demand?
3. What % of that 0.4B is ""produced"" by CLNE? I understand that CLNE is just getting back into the upstream side, but how far behind are they from its major competitors? Who are the biggest RNG producers and what is their total production capacity?
4. Who are the major players for the downstream side? Is Chevron planning to just  replace their underground diesel tanks at all their service stations with LNG (instead of using pipelines like RNG)? Oh, what are the benefits/disadvantages of RNG over LNG? Do you think LNG would be a threat to CLNE, and if so, what do you think they have up their sleeve to ensure survival and success?
5. That last question made me question whether RNG is the smarter solution than LNG (liquid natural gas) because an infrastructure for liquid fuel is already in place. Tell me how stupid I am, that there's a huge gap in my understanding.

Thanks in advance for your super research and insight!"
2021-06-17 11:11:38,wallstreetbets,The CEO of CLNE is reportedly going on CNBC tonight at 6pm to give a business update. Hopefully that will help the stock break through. Yesterday was a good discount though. I'm holding 149 shares and still believe cow farts are rocket fuel.

2021-06-17 09:03:11,wallstreetbets,"ahaha thanks for the PhD, indeed I have been covering the sector for years

About your questions:

1. Trucking industry choices by 2030 will be diversified. It is wise for any tech not to target a 90% market share. This is impossible. It is more likely that we see various solutions all together. At the moment, CNG & LNG trucks have a 10% market share in China and 4% market share in Europe. In the USA the % stays at less than 2%, so the US will catch up dramatically. Which is the cap? I would say 15-20% market share, which will be more than enough to make CLNE infrastructure very profitable. In this regards, you can look at [Westport investors presentations](https://s26.q4cdn.com/361830528/files/doc_presentations/2021/06/MarketingMaterialsV1.pdf), where Volvo Trucks and Cummins forecasts are outlined (slide 12); both the companies see a 8-15% market share in the years to come. Or you can look at the [BNEF report](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/trucks-haul-zero-emissions-technology-into-commercial-vehicle-arena-59488098) , where they state that just one in five Heavy Trucks will be electric by 2040, with natural gas playing an important role.
2. Not all the RNG will be used in transport, a part of it will be injected into pipelines, while another will be used as biogas (the not refined version) for power generation. Be careful those billions of RNG gallons represent a POTENTIAL supply, not the existing one today.
3. At the moment $CLNE does not produce any RNG, they are setting up the JVs now. On the upstream side, British Petroleum is by far the largest producer thanks to the facilities bought from CLNE.
4. Major competitors on the downstream side are private companies [https://www.loves.com/](https://www.loves.com/)  ; [https://americannaturalgas.com/](https://americannaturalgas.com/)  and other smaller ones. All these companies, included CLNE, mostly sell Compressed NAtural Gas. LNG is not yet popular in the USA as it is in Europe and China but there will some growth in coastal areas. RNG can be either CNG or LNG. CLNE sells a small portion of LNG in its stations
5. Liquefied RNG in Europe is called BIO-LNG. There is not much difference between the two concepts. But LNG stations are more expensive to build.

A good LNG engine, with diesel like power but NG like emissions, is HPDI 2.0 by Westport"
2021-06-17 11:14:16,wallstreetbets,"yes 18:00 eastern time, I think that if they say that Total is selling to finance the massive biomethane effort much of the downside pressure will fade. Let's see"
2021-06-17 11:13:24,wallstreetbets,"Yes and listed companies on the engines side exist too, one day they will get recognition as much as $CLNE"
2021-06-17 13:54:56,wallstreetbets,Yes the co-founder of Westport founded Greenlane. Pretty weak at the moment but if the RNG theme takes off it will succeed
2021-06-17 07:21:04,wallstreetbets,while at the same time being way more efficient with an available infrastructure.. cant not invest in this tbh

2021-06-17 07:34:01,wallstreetbets,"So you said it was much less mainstream than hydrogen, which is correct. At the same time though, RNG is much more efficient, meaning its even greener (carbon negative), way cheaper (you can easily convert diesel trucks to RNG trucks today, CLNE will actually help you with that) while at the same time there is an existing infrastructure for RNG with lots of fueling stations already in place, while the infrastructure for hydrogen is more of a ""would be nice""-thought experiment, meaning it doesnt exist. Hope that helps?"

2021-06-17 11:40:00,wallstreetbets,"Hey mods, if you're out there, wondering if I can write a DD about RKT options chain right now. I noticed this last night while building my gamma ramp screener thing. 

Basically if the IV were to go up, the amount of option buying required would blast the thing off, similar to March 2nd. At least, in theory (see chart below).

So the gist of the DD would be: If enough of you apes buy FDs on this, it's going to take off. Not sure if that'd be ""pumping"" or not. Realistically there's no other catalyst that would cause IV to pop up. So the DD would basically be a bet on the DD itself being effective.  Idk, just feels weird so I thought I'd ask.

I don't personally have any skin in the game, I don't follow RKT (I used to), but the risk/reward for buying FDs is pretty good. Would be a fairly educational post as well.

Edit: nevermind, no time today. But still curious if such a DD is acceptable or not, particularly on a hugely liquid ticker with tons of FDs so it's clear it's not a pump.

I drift back to sleep.

OH GOD OH FUCK WHAT THE FUCKS GOING ON

The same thing happens again at 3:15.

It is the same roach. Injured but undeterred.

I freak out again, swipe him off the bed and mash him into the carpet.

I go take a long shower.

When I get back to my bedroom I double fucking check because he IS NOT WHERE I LEFT HIM.

I draw back the covers and there he is. Crippled but made it back on top of the bed for the 3rd time.


He is now a fine paste and deposited into 2 different trash cans.

According to this article the new price goes into affect from July 20. What happens to those who bought shares after june 21 but before july 19? Those shares have to split as well right?

Instead we got a dot-plot which is not a forecast as JPow has the final say, and market panicked.

We are still getting $180bn of buying every month. But market is looking for an excuse to dump. I feel like the only thing that could make the market dump seriously, is a couple of scary red days - the narrative would come after.

But in my view the rational thing to do is to remain long. I'm still terrified though."

2021-06-17 11:12:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I can explain where that went wrong with u/cafenegroporfa 's post for transparency. 

The sub this week openly talked about preplanning posts and upvoting it. Same shit that CLNE and CLOV does. Vote manipulation to get something trending. We are aware so obviously going to watch closely and be suspicious. 

Moments after it was posted a mod recognized it was already heavily awarded. That is sus. Cquintessential unapologetically admitted he heavily awarded it and started harassing a mod. Makes us check who everyone is commenting - surprise, surprise, they rarely comment in wsb. 

We can't plan propping up content on outside subs regardless of who it is posting it. 

and to the other point, DD is often removed automatically for things like a link that needs fixed, or verifying something. I can look into why u/pennyether 's was removed at first, but it happens often - and we did resolve it."

2021-06-17 14:00:09,wallstreetbets,"Yep loans are generally still down and businesses are more inclined to hoard cash reserves than spend it.   So does a bank really want bunch of trash on their balance sheet making nothing?  Nope, in comes the reverse Repo to give it an asset that generates some income, like a loan would but much smaller amount, and the banks can continue accepting deposits.  If the reverse Repo dries up, banks will refuse deposits even more, and maybe that would get money momentum back up to, which in turn would lower the deposit amounts and potentially avenues for loans but I would imagine if banks stopped accepting deposits widespread, there would be a panic and bank runs, which would be bad 🙂"

i had mentioned posting it to memetron last night but no one else, i only have a measly call and shares. I just love JMIA and want it to be on more people’s radar. 

I’m guessing the huzzah crew saw me post even though i didn’t cross post or mention it to anyone, like i had told memetron. There all dumbasses for brigading and giving me a million awards.

2021-06-17 11:26:16,wallstreetbets,"Brigades are out in full force, as well as coordination. Three DD's on ITUB out of nowhere (two within hours of one another yesterday).

My post on WWE was removed without reasons -- I assume for linking to imgur or SA. Thank you mods for handling it so quickly. Same with BGS.

There's a lot of strange shit going on with DDs themselves, and how the ""market"" reacts to them. I feel my recent ""success"", if you want to call it that, of WWE has ushered in a wave of people trying to pump tickers that are easily moved.

Certainly wasn't my intent when writing it.. a good 50% of that DD was for the lulz and the rest because I actually thought the risk/reward was pretty good. Yeah, the calls I had from the days prior printed, but that was an unexpected side effect.

Sorry for what I've wrought, though I suspect these type of shenanigans have always been going on, just not this rapidly."

It also shows the rate that the number of shares deltahedged will change based on price (gamma), time (charm), and vol (vanna).  I use % float and % daily volume to give an indication of magnitude.

For RKT both the %float and %vol numbers are pretty insane right now, particularly vanna."

btw I'm not a mod, which you probably know.

But in my opinion, saying ""If this were to happen, I think it could cause that to happen"" is more or less the basis of just about any DD.

Saying ""here is my prediction"", is, to me, very different than saying ""you should do this to cause that"".

If worded correctly with the right intent (which I think you have) then it would be a travesty to not let you write it up and share your knowledge.

It's educational. Lord knows we all need more of that."

It's time to inverse it

Long XLF or $KRE and Short $QQQ this time

I could write a long and thoughtful DD but it's wasted on you tards so here's the TLDR :

FED's commitment to AIT has taken a hit, at least on the credibility level

FED's forecast regarding the path to full employment is much more bullish than the last 3 botched NFPs would have suggested. they are forecasting (with high confidence) that once UI lapses and children go back to school we will get a surge in employment. A reasonable assumption but If i was at their place I'd wait till it actually happens. but that's besides the point here. 

anyway all of this warrants higher real rates and higher nominal rates. Good for banks, bad for QQQ. 

LONG $XLF & KRE 25 delta 1 month vs Long QQQ Put 25 delta 1 month

the dollar and gold already adjusted, NQ hasn't yet as the dip was for some reason bot yesterday but they are already getting fucked in pre market and should keep getting fucked. at 14K NQ required dovish FED.. not what pow gave us yesterday."

JP Morgan CIO on bloomberg video yesterday: We want to hear the following three things.  1) Substantial progress made.  2) Dot plot shows earlier rate hike.  3)  Rate on reverse repo raised.

Then, they say: we are not likely to get any of that.  We gonna go 0 for 3.

We got 2 out 3 and JPow dropped a hawkish (for him at least) presser.  Not to mention officially talking about talking. Everyone shocked right now and few expected it.

Banks were pricing in shit that JPow made very clear wouldn’t happen (rate hikes by year end). Now that might still end up happening, but JPM and others shouldn’t have been trying to date and force the fed into doing it. 

Tech meanwhile is still under forward p/e’s and has been priming for a breakout after trading mostly flat for two months. The rotation to tech and consumer products has been beyond obvious and is playing out rn. Give it a day or two and banks will be fine to long again."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Confession of a Dividend Addict: How ASTS Cured Me. My First Yolo with 300K! I have a big confession. I was addicted to dividend stocks up until December 2020.

I was bringing in about $1,200 month from my dividends and faithfully buying more shares of ABBV, APPL, PEP, MMM, T and other dividend kings and aristocrats. I would text my older brother each month something like ""I'm now making another $20 a month more in dividends and I'm getting that much closer to financial freedom."" Please refer to the image below where I would brag about the ""huge"" dividends I secured one month.

&#x200B;

[0.0013 closer to retirement in just ONE MONTH!](https://preview.redd.it/p47p9r4d6s571.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0f9746d8c3eac880133165edbb80cf7252997a7)

A big part of my dividend portfolio was in T which contributed about $500 a month of my monthly dividend. I loved getting my T dividend every 3 months, but in the back of my mind I had a nagging fear that some amazing technology could disrupt, negate, or challenge their business model.

One day in December 2020 while on Seeking Alpha, a random person wrote to me about $ASTS in the comments section of an article. I immediately started to research ASTS and I was intrigued and initially horrified at the same time the more I delved into ASTS. I was absolutely terrified because with every piece of information I digested on ASTS, the more I came to a very powerful conclusion - they could destroy ATT's model. Suddenly my blanket of security. MY PLAN to retire in 2030 (13 years ahead of my peers at the agency I work for) seemed to vanish. But I preserved looking for a weakness in their proposed plans so I could regain peace of mind in my dividends. I continued to dig and discovered that their business model is to partner with the existing cellphone companies and strengthen and expand their network. This is sheer genius!

The biggest cost in any business besides employees and raw goods is typically customer acquisition. By partnering with ATT, Vodafone, and others ASTS is able to fill a much-needed space for themselves without alienating the existing players. Their 50/50 profit sharing is an essential part of the business and provides their partners with a massive incentive to keep collaborating. So, PHEW ATT's dividend was safe from ASTS putting them out of business. I was so relieved. But then I stopped and really pondered at the risk and the reward before my eyes. The more DD I continued to do, the more I realized this is truly low risk with astronomical return potential.

I then had a hard conversation after more thinking and studying with myself that no dividend addict wants to have. Diversification protects wealth, but concentration creates it. And I was pretty diversified with all my dividend stocks. So all my DD in ASTS gave me confidence to sell every single dividend stock in my portfolio....which was all I had at the time. I was hooked on boomer dividend stocks and ASTS was the stock that cured me. And so ASTS is my first YOLO play and quite possibly my last because its success means I will become a multi-millionaire.

From 100% boomer stocks to now 17,777 shares, 750 warrants, and 600+ calls that together equal a little over 400K. If you have boomer stock dependency and want to get off the intoxicating drug of tiny returns that dividends offer, do your ASTS DD and you will get cured.

&#x200B;

[SHARES AND WARRANTS YOLO!](https://preview.redd.it/6b6ppvhh6s571.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e7ce6d47358c273d339998a06e47580f24f61f9)

[OPTIONS YOLO!](https://preview.redd.it/epv1l8ii6s571.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e59d3eead32f87b14fa5d7dfac3b1d4ec4bf168)

Side effects of ASTS may include, buying more shares and calls than you originally intended and may include up to and including a resounding YOOOOOOOOLOOOOOOO because you have come to the same conclusion as me - this is not a 50/50 stock paired with equally matched returns or losses. This is a stock that if successful will generate up to 100x returns while risking at the time of this writing less than $12 a share. $12 loss for a potential 100x return by 2030 or sooner? Where else can I find those odds? Maybe some game of chance in Vegas? But this is not a lottery ticket or gamble where random luck determines success or failure, this is an investment and if you will take the time to do your research, you too will say ""ASTS cured me!!!""

2021-06-17 08:35:11,wallstreetbets,"Kind of an unknown at this point. I'm sure with time the capabilities of starlink will expand beyond their pizza dish. Though one HUGE FUCKING ADVANTAGE is that starlink actually exists and people are using it, every other company is just vaporware.

Honestly, this isn't the first company with grand visions of mobile cellular/space roaming capabilities. Remember LightSquared, now called Ligado? They've been trying for over a decade with so many legal hurdles, forget that they haven't actually built or launched a single satellite.

A smarter play that I think we are going to see soon in extremely remote locations is setting up a cell tower, using starlink to connect it to the network, and tesla battery / solar to power it if there's no powerlines nearby."

2021-06-17 11:47:25,wallstreetbets,They are boring if you are poor but individuals like myself can get 6X leverage at 1% interest and collect dividend income.

If you persist on doing this and adding more capital than take a really hard look at what you are currently doing and realize that what it is will never be successful. Change up the strategy. To me you must be buying weeklies and getting crushed. So my suggestion is do shares solely or sell premium. Wins are not as big but the gains do slowly pile up."

Seriously, the vast majority of the posts on here are literally people wishing out loud.

You're gonna be poor.

My advice? And it's the advice of someone who isn't in any way a financial advisor (or even good at this) you'll get out now, sign up for something with a robo-advisor like axosinvest and let a computer generate money for you. It won't be fast, but you won't eat ramen when you're 80."

2021-06-17 05:56:25,wallstreetbets,I wish you the best of luck but I figure you had enough to just buy stock and easily double and take advantage of the deeper itm but still cheat safer options. Is something specific going to happen from now to the 30th. Ik wish undervalue by a good bit but what’s going on?
2021-06-17 08:53:33,wallstreetbets,Have you bought any amc stock?

2021-06-17 05:40:04,wallstreetbets,My wife’s boyfriend said that you can’t argue with retards that think buying a stock @ 300 is as good of a play as buying it @ 15.
2021-06-17 08:06:53,wallstreetbets,"Reddit scraping bots hate him. They think we're retarded, but we're getting too smart for them. 😛"
2021-06-17 11:01:26,wallstreetbets,"I’m convinced the reason AMC is more popular than GME is because retards don’t understand that stock price on its own is fucking meaningless (assuming you’re not so poor that the stock price is higher than your funds).  They see a “cheaper” stock and jump on it even though dollar-for-dollar, you get way more ownership of GME."
2021-06-17 05:47:06,wallstreetbets,$300 is still a great price for such a great stock

2021-06-17 08:50:50,wallstreetbets,"I read somewhere that they think oil will hit $100 by the end of the year, which personally I do NOT think is going to happen. It's going to climb slowly, but we're already halfway through 2021 and the world is still dragging its feet. Someone else said it's going to be the second half of 2022 before we see pre-pandemic demand.

Getting in on ~~oil~~ energy companies right now is still reasonably priced, they have nowhere to go but up over the next year or two easy as demand will climb for oil & ng.

Most auto companies are going all-in on electric, but it's going to be a slow adoption from the public and there's still a lot of uses where it's not feasible yet.

Bonus, most of these energy companies pay good dividends.

Disclosure: I have Exxon & Chevron shares."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Ternium ($TX) - A Masterclass DD on the Most Profitable Steel Company in the Americas Today, the Federal Reserve [**finally admitted**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/16/fed-holds-rates-steady-but-raises-inflation-expectations-sharply-and-makes-no-mention-of-taper.html) that they might not have control of the reigns with regards to inflation (for those paying attention, it's been a long time coming).

Who wins in inflationary environments? [**Commodities**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/021605.asp).

**What follows is my favorite play for the next 12-18 Months.**

**-** [**Ternium**](https://us.ternium.com/en) **(TX)** is a Latin American steel company which specializes in producing high-margin finished flat-steel goods, primarily for the American and Mexican manufacturing markets. They are currently both the **most profitable** and **most undervalued** steel producer in the Americas.  


[Since When did Steel Companies Have Good Branding?](https://preview.redd.it/00841hak6r571.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89a7f05e42dabbf22a5d12cdcbc19a11c0f728c6)

This is going to be a long post. It will touch on the macroeconomic and political landscape of the steel industry (**hint:** it's fantastic), as well as Ternium's financials, operational history, outlook, and risk profile.

# If you want a quick and dirty of the case for Ternium (TX), here you go:

&#x200B;

1. **Pricing Power:**   
Steel prices have **doubled or tripled in the past year** across various finished products; **vertically integrated steel companies** that mine their own iron ore, make their own casting products and convert those into high-margin finished steel for manufacturers currently have a veritable license to print money in this environment. **Ternium checks all these boxes, and is** [**making shitton of money because of it.**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/net-income) Additionally, Ternium enjoys unfettered access to the favorably-priced North American steel market due to USMCA exemptions from [TEA Section 232 Tariffs](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/030421-section-232-tariffs-on-steel-aluminum-effective-us-commerce-secretary), all while reaping the lower operating costs associated with labor and capital expenditures in Latin America.  

2. **Pricing Longevity:**  
**Those high steel prices are not going anywhere soon** \- even as other commodities like lumber show signs of weakness. Manufacturer inventories are at [record lows](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042921-climb-in-us-finished-steel-prices-expected-to-continue-platts-survey), [Demand is back](https://www.worldsteel.org/steel-by-topic/statistics/short-range-outlook.html) above [2019](https://www.worldsteel.org/en/dam/jcr:96d7a585-e6b2-4d63-b943-4cd9ab621a91/World%2520Steel%2520in%2520Figures%25202019.pdf) levels and only projected to grow, and [shipping constraints](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/delays-and-capacity-constraints-are-new-normal-in-container-shipping) combined with post-COVID infrastructure-as-stimulus plans being pumped internationally ([1](https://prospect.org/politics/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-infrastructure-bills/), [2](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/g7-rivals-china-with-grand-infrastructure-plan-7356564/), [3](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/how-foreign-technology-investors-benefit-from-chinas-new-infrastructure-plan/), [4](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2020/10/mexican-government-announces-us145m-infrastructure-plan), [5](https://www.iadb.org/en/news/infrastructure-transformation-will-generate-big-windfall-latin-america-and-caribbean), [6](https://www.bnamericas.com/en/analysis/brazil-putting-final-touches-on-major-infrastructure-plan), [7](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d3e77637-a963-11eb-9585-01aa75ed71a1/language-en)) will carry elevated pricing through 2022 and beyond.Additionally, **China,** **which accounts for** [**50% of global steel production**](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-50-years-of-global-steel-production/) and 20% of  global exports, is making moves to vacate the export market in an attempt to curb pollution and keep domestic prices low. In late April they [slashed their tax incentives](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042821-china-removes-vat-rebate-on-steel-exports-cuts-tax-on-raw-material-imports-to-zero) for steel exports, and in late May began floating rumors of a new [tax on exports](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3990727/FOCUS-What-Chinas-possible-new-steel-export-taxes-mean-for-global-ferrous-industry.html) \- a complete reversal of the economic policy which has cemented China as the world's largest steel provider. Domestic markets outside of China will struggle immensely to replace missing Chinese capacity.  

3. **Increasing Market Share:**  
**Ternium is one of only two North American companies** (the other being STLD) bringing new capacity online to capture market share during this pricing spike; **their** [**Pesqueria Mill**](https://investors.ternium.com/English/ternium/featured-stories/featured-stories-details/2020/New-investment-program-A-logical-next-step-after-the-integration-of-the-Rio-de-Janeiro-facility-to-Terniums-industrial-system/default.aspx) **saw the rollout of its first hot rolled coil production ahead of schedule last month**. Located 90 Miles from the Texas border, this mill is expected to produce annual capacity totaling 7 Million tons of shipped steel across several of the industry's highest-margin products, and provides convenient market access to the American Southwest and Mexico's manufacturing market.  

4. **Fundamentally Undervalued:**  
**Ternium's share price** has been beaten up due to perceived geopolitical risk in the Latin American states it operates in. Because of this, Ternium is currently trading at both the lowest F**orward (3.5) and** [**Historic (4.99) P/E ratios**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/pe-ratio) in the industry, all while having the [**highest industry EPS**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted)**,** [**lowest Price/Book ratio**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/price-book)**,** [**lowest Debt/Equity Ratio**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/debt-equity-ratio)**, and highest** [**Return on Equity**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/roe). **It currently trades below the book value of its hard assets.** It is without a doubt the most undervalued steel company in the midst of a historic industry cycle.  

5. **Market Mechanics:**  
**Ternium is an extremely low-volume stock.** Why? Because it's a Mexican steel company - no one thinks about Mexican steel companies.It's **100-day Average Volume sits at just 762,314**. Compare this to it its other American and South American mid-cap steel peers:
   1. NUE - **3,502,597**
   2. CLF - **23,576,139**
   3. SID - **4,119,684**
   4. GGB - **15,436,760**
   5. STLD- **2,384,091**  
Additionally, a collective [**74% of Ternium**](https://s2.q4cdn.com/156255844/files/doc_presentations/2021/Ternium-2021-05.pdf) is owned by parent company [Techint](https://www.techint.com/es) and sister company [Tenaris](https://www.tenaris.com/en), who are in turn both owned by **San Faustin,** the holding company of the Italian Industrialist family [the Rocca's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Rocca). The Rocca's have not filed with the SEC since [June of last year](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-015765/) (and additionally have not updated their ownership stake in their monthly [investor slide decks](https://s2.q4cdn.com/156255844/files/doc_presentations/2021/Ternium-2021-05.pdf)).This indicates that the ADR's ([American Depository Receipts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp)) actively being traded on the NYSE account for only 24% of the company's available market cap (2% are held in treasury shares by the company).**All this is to say** that when the entire steel industry reports their best quarters in history over the next two months, **increased inflows have the potential to rocket Ternium's share price relative to its higher-volume peers.**

**That's the TL:DR**. Now, on to the meat and potatoes.

# The Commodity Landscape

The trajectory of the current commodity bull run is the subject of debate amongst analysts. Many widely believed to be transient - largely the result of hiccups in the supply chain post-covid, compounded by economies and demand scaling back up quicker than expected.

However, the market reacts and follows even temporary spikes in commodity pricing. Commodity producers/growers/miners typically have fairly fixed overhead costs, so when windfalls in pricing come their way, their net income skyrockets. This has been reflected in commodity companies' share prices, particularly since November, when speculative tech, biopharma, renewables, and the other beneficiaries of the 2020 bull run that **were not tethered to fundamentals** began to show their first signs of weakness in anticipation of the impending economic reopening.

Most analysts do not expect this commodity run to last too deeply into 2022, and for many commodities, I would agree. Lumber so far is following this trend: after skyrocketing on the back of record housing demand and stocking shortages during the pandemic, it has recently began it's [inevitable correction](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/plunge-in-lumber-contracts-signals-turning-point-for-wood-rally) following a [13% drop in new-housing starts](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/index.html?utm_campaign=&utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) between March and April.

&#x200B;

[Ouch](https://preview.redd.it/whp833cm6r571.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2e95be3bdfec04aa59ac17ab36e40213be0730a)

# What Commodity's High pricing and High Demand is Not Transient Might you Ask? Steel.

**US Hot Rolled Coil (HRC),** a benchmark steel product used in the production of blanks for cars, farm and industrial equipment, white goods, railcars, doors, shelving, and tons of other stuff, has risen over [300% in the past year](https://www.thefabricator.com/thefabricator/blog/metalsmaterials/steel-prices-reach-levels-not-seen-since-2008) from lows of $440/ton to all time highs above $1600/ton. Other finished steel products like cold rolled coil, tubular steel, and semi-finished casting products like billet have seen similar price increases.

&#x200B;

[Killer chart title by S&P Global. Who said commodities reporting had to be boring?](https://preview.redd.it/rw11g65o6r571.jpg?width=560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6956b4d7a21483a7e85147b370065ffbf79aeacf)

The narrative surrounding the longevity of this steel pricing [is starting to change](https://fortune.com/2021/06/14/steel-prices-going-up-surge-2022/) in the industry's favor. Just this morning, [JP Morgan issued increased price targets](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sell-u-s-steel-because-other-steel-stocks-are-better-bets-analyst-says-51623865736?siteid=yhoof2) across the sector in light of the stability in high pricing. It is my opinion that prices will likely soften slightly in 2022 as supply catches up with demand to a **moderate degree**, but will remain elevated between $1000-1200 due to the following:

**1)** [**Demand is expected to increase**](https://www.worldsteel.org/steel-by-topic/statistics/short-range-outlook.html) **by 5.8% globally this year and an additional 2.8% the following year by the World Steel Association**.

Albeit, that is after a contraction in demand during 2020 - however, the point is that demand isn't going anywhere, and it will probably be higher than forecasted in the coming years.

**Why's that?**

What do governments do to stimulate their economies when unemployment remains elevated, and continued monetary stimulus runs the risk of spiking inflation (I.E., where we're at now)?

**They use infrastructure spending as stimulus.**

Grid upgrades, turbine and PV panel installs, bridge and rail improvements, and EV production/purchasing incentives are all ideas being floated by governments to combat climate change and reenergize economic activity - this is already coming to fruition in China, the US, and plenty of other countries ([1](https://prospect.org/politics/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-infrastructure-bills/), [2](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/g7-rivals-china-with-grand-infrastructure-plan-7356564/), [3](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/how-foreign-technology-investors-benefit-from-chinas-new-infrastructure-plan/), [4](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2020/10/mexican-government-announces-us145m-infrastructure-plan), [5](https://www.iadb.org/en/news/infrastructure-transformation-will-generate-big-windfall-latin-america-and-caribbean), [6](https://www.bnamericas.com/en/analysis/brazil-putting-final-touches-on-major-infrastructure-plan), [7](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d3e77637-a963-11eb-9585-01aa75ed71a1/language-en)).

**2) The Steel industry has consolidated, remaining players are wary of risks, and production capacity has been permanently shuttered.**

In the past the steel industry has fallen prey to over-producing when times are good and prices are high, with the eventual effect of glutting supply and gouging their own margins. However, the industry has been consolidating into fewer hands, and CEO's have been vocal about keeping margins high even if it means keeping production capacity offline.

As one example in the US, Cleveland Cliffs (CLF) recently acquired both [ArcelorMittal USA](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cleveland-cliffs-clf-wraps-arcelormittal-174505849.html) and [AK Steel](http://www.clevelandcliffs.com/English/news-center/news-releases/news-releases-details/2020/Cleveland-Cliffs-Completes-Acquisition-of-AK-Steel/default.aspx), taking two primary players off the map and becoming the second largest steel producer in the US. In a prudent bid at ensuring sustainable long-term profitability over short-term reward, they are leaving 2 of their 10 available plants shuttered (discussed by CEO Lourenco Goncalves in [last quarter's earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcr/)).

Abroad, Sanjeev Gupta's Steel conglomerate GFG Alliance is [on the verge of collapse](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/first-parts-of-billionaire-sanjeev-gupta-s-steel-empire-headed-for-bankruptcy-11618542117896.html), leaving considerable assets up for grabs by other players there - ArcelorMittal, the largest steel producer ex-China, [has already put in a bid for their French assets.](https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-decide-by-july-9-arcelormittal-bid-liberty-steel-france-2021-06-08/)

3) **Inflation**

As mentioned above, the Fed [**finally admitted today**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/16/fed-holds-rates-steady-but-raises-inflation-expectations-sharply-and-makes-no-mention-of-taper.html) that inflation might (***read***\*: will)\* be more of a problem than they've been indicating. Again, See [**this interview**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/paul-tudor-jones-says-bet-heavily-on-every-inflation-trade-if-fed-keeps-ignoring-higher-prices.html) for some fun commentary on how the big fish are likely to react react in the coming months. [Commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/021605.asp) will lead the pack in inflationary environments, and the steel industry has a ton of tailwinds.

4) **Changes in Chinese Export Policy**

* **Decreases in Chinese steel exports**  have already begun due to the [tightening of pollution controls](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/china-to-tighten-steel-capacity-swap-controls-from-june-1-2021-05-06) and [removal of tax rebates](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042821-china-removes-vat-rebate-on-steel-exports-cuts-tax-on-raw-material-imports-to-zero) for exports.
   * This point is **HUGE.** China accounts for more than [50% of global steel production](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-50-years-of-global-steel-production/) **and 20% of the export market -** They have been suppressing global steel prices via glutting supply for the last 12 years, made possible by their notoriously relaxed environmental laws and substantial tax rebates for exported steel products.

&#x200B;

[How's that for market share?](https://preview.redd.it/psxqihsr6r571.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e58d99125f5671634910f94198909a3db9988e5)

* However, Chinese trade policy has recently completely 180'd in this regard. **There is no conceivable way** that producers will be able to make up for the void in supply left by a partial Chinese departure from the export market.
   * Additionally, the approaching 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing will likely be preceded by industrial output restrictions similar to those [prior to 2008's Summer Olympics](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-closures-factbox/factbox-factories-shut-for-blue-sky-for-beijing-olympics-idUSSHA32043020080723), further depleting Chinese steel available for export. Hebei, Beijing's home province, accounts for roughly 15% of total Chinese steel production; pollution & production limits [there have already begun.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-pollution-tangshan/chinas-top-steelmaking-city-tangshan-tightens-pollution-controls-idUSKCN1VX1DS)

# The Company:

**Ternium ($TX)** Is the flat-steel producing arm of the [**Techint**](https://www.steelonthenet.com/kb/history-techint.html) **group.**

* Founded by Italian industrialist [Agostino Rocca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agostino_Rocca) in the 1940's following Mussolini's fall from power, Techint would eventually expand into pretty much every infrastructure venture in South America. In addition to Ternium, Techint has controlling interests in [Tenaris](https://www.tenaris.com/en) ($TS), a major Argentiain producer of tubular steel for the petroleum industry,  TecPetrol (a natural gas provider) and three other companies in the South American industrial space.
* You don't need to know anything else about Techint or Tenaris aside from the fact that they collectively own 74% of Ternium's outstanding shares, and that both are controlled by the Rocca Family's holding company, [San Faustin.](https://fintel.io/i/san-faustin)

# Operational History, Strategic Placement, and Financials:

**Ternium was formed** in 2005 following the merger of three steel companies; one Mexican, one Argentinian, and one Venezuelan. The company began publicly trading in 2006, and has since expanded it's footprint all the right places.

* They [acquired Mexico's IMSA Steel in 2007](https://www.reuters.com/article/imsa-ternium/update-2-ternium-to-take-control-of-mexicos-imsa-idUSN3019023020070430), in the process becoming the largest Mexican steel producer. This was a timely acquisition, as the Mexican manufacturing sector was in mid-launch:

&#x200B;

[Might as well be a graph of demand for Ternium's steel.](https://preview.redd.it/vw9z8gav6r571.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cc628388ac6f8966073bc15222fcc6b2c463a7e)

Mexico in many ways serves as an outsourced manufacturing sector for the American market: [76% of Exports end up in the US.](https://insights.tetakawi.com/manufacturing-in-mexico-everything-you-need-to-know) Ternium is the primary provider of the flat steel that goes into those finished goods.

* In 2017, Ternium [acquired Thyssenkrupp's Brazilian steel slab production facilities](https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/ternium-csa-thyssenkrupp-acquisition/). This allowed them to internalize the production of **all the crude steel necessary** for their high-end flat rolled products, and transformed them into a net exporter of steel slab^(1). In conjunction with their Iron Ore mining operations in Michoacan, Pihuamo and Colima, as well as their Pelletisation/Benefication plant at Manzanillo, this acquisition integrated Ternium across the entire production lifecycle. **Vertical integration is pricing power, which in this market is $.**
* Ternium continues to add capacity increases, most notably their [Pesqueria Mill](https://investors.ternium.com/English/ternium/featured-stories/featured-stories-details/2020/New-investment-program-A-logical-next-step-after-the-integration-of-the-Rio-de-Janeiro-facility-to-Terniums-industrial-system/default.aspx), which is expected to add production capacity totaling 7 Million tons of High-Margin flat rolled products including ""*4.4 Million Tons of hot rolled products, 1.6 million tons of cold-rolled products, 830,000 tons of hot-dipped galvanized products and 120,000 tons of pre-painted products.*""  


[Goddamn, that is one good-looking plant.](https://preview.redd.it/9r01202x6r571.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8f82e343366ff43d31aeb143c0ac318419bc308)

In spite of these capital expenditures, Ternium remains the most consistently profitable steel company in the Americas:  


[Source: Macrotrends](https://preview.redd.it/0vu3ks207r571.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=c58e99d12479d00b4d896562d4a5e6f6045b49bf)

Lets compare that to Nucor (NUE), the second most profitable steel company on the continent and the best performing stock in the S&P500 YTD.  


[As a side note, you should probably also buy Nucor.](https://preview.redd.it/qk1iqqq17r571.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9c95512e7a7aa13e1a6c2f180a0657e646fe0d6)

Looks pretty similar right? They even posted the same EPS for 1Q 2021. **The difference here is that Nucor's stock is up 90% Year-To-Date compared to Ternium's 17%.**

Some of this was touched on in the introduction, but to reiterate:

* Currently trading at both the lowest F**orward (3.5) and** [**Historic (4.99) P/E ratios**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/pe-ratio) in the industry.
* Has the [**highest industry EPS**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted) **and highest** [**Return on Equity**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/roe).
* Has the lowest [**lowest Price/Book ratio**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/price-book) **and** [**lowest Debt/Equity Ratio**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/debt-equity-ratio)**.** currently trades below the book value of its hard assets.
* **1Q 2021 saw a 26% increase in revenue,** following increases of 22% and 21% in the prior two quarters.
* **EBITDA Margin increased** from 13% in 1Q 2020 to 25% in 4Q2020, and again to **33% in 1Q 2021.**
* Oh, did I mention they pay a **2.10 (6%) dividend?** You could buy TX for the growth and still make your annual Boglehead returns off divies if you wanted to.

# Additional Factors to Consider:

**Market Mechanics:**

1. **Again, here is how Ternium's** [**100-day Average Volume**](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TX/technical-analysis) **compares to it's peers:**
   1. TX -  **762,314**.
   2. NUE - **3,502,597**
   3. CLF - **23,576,139**
   4. SID - **4,119,684**
   5. GGB - **15,436,760**
   6. STLD- **2,384,091**This, combined with the relatively low percentage of Ternium's market cap that trades publicly as ADR's (24%), means **heavy inflows have the potential to move Ternium's share price faster than it's peers -** and heavy inflows are coming\*\*.\*\*A number of Steel companies are going to **report their best earnings of all time** this quarter; Ternium will be one of them. STLD and NUE released adjusted Q2  guidance today; if theirs was anything to go off, Ternium will destroy Q2 (links to their updates [here](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-stld-earnings-guidance-2021-06-2-3/) and [here](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-nue-earnings-guidance-2021-06-2-3/)).It is my opinion that the bevy of incredible earnings combined with **forward guidance projecting the longevity of this cycle** will shift the popular narrative for steel. Once this happens \*\*the industry will see a heavy inflow of volume as one of the safest commodity sectors to be in during an inflationary period with an uncertain timeline.\*\*Steel companies' share prices will begin to divorce from commodity indexes, and the cream will rise to the top. Ternium is creamy.

\*\*Institutional Ownership:\*\*Institutions reporting an ownership stake in Ternium stayed relatively stable between 4Q2020 and 1Q2021. **Several notable investors increased** their stake in Q12021, including Citigroup, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Blackrock, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche bank, The Canadian Government's Pension Plan, The Royal Bank of Canada... it goes on. [Source.](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/tx)

Institutional inflows probably stayed stable for obvious reasons: early investors deleveraging their risk following Ternium's 200%+ rise from the pandemic lows balanced out with those recognizing the early innings of a steel boom. Of particular note - The Rocca's have not adjusted their stake in Ternium since [June of last year](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-015765/).

It's clear that plenty of investors are reducing their stake based on recent price action - let's look at why.

# Risks:

* **Currency Risk**
   * Ternium operates in developing countries with currencies historically less stable than the dollar. However, 75% of Ternium's steel shipments (and the vast majority of their High-Margin sales) are in countries with stable or appreciating currencies - the USA, Brazil and Mexico.In fact, Mexico and Brazil's currencies have both been appreciating relative to the dollar since March, and [will likely continue to do so.](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/featured-reports/mexican-stirs-price-upside-rates-risk.html#) Both nation's central banks have already shown tighter monetary policy than the US in the COVID landscape, and the Fed's meeting today all but confirmed this will continue.

&#x200B;

[Ternium's 2020 Steel Shipment Allocations by Country\/Region.](https://preview.redd.it/thmu1qg57r571.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ec729f6adfb34fe9e4bd574dd8af1d79911edc3)

* Ternium ships the remaining 25% of their steel to Argentina, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, and other countries institutional investors have largely shunned recently. The currency risk in these countries is certainly more serious.
   * However, exposure to the aforementioned countries hasn't kept them from being extremely profitable in the past - even during periods when their primary market's currency's (**Mexico and Brazil**) were depreciating (See Ternium's 2017/18 [earnings](https://s2.q4cdn.com/156255844/files/doc_financials/quarterly/PR-Ternium-1Q18-final.pdf) and share price performance).
* **Exposure to Unstable Sociopolitical Environments**
   * Aside from the general market dumping, This is likely the crux behind Ternium's recent price action. Some of the Mexican states Ternium operates in are exposed to substantial civil unrest and political violence.In particular, the state of Michoacan, where Ternium's subsidiary [Las Encinas SA](https://www.bnamericas.com/en/company-profile/las-encinas-sa-de-cv-las-encinas) operates their Aquila Mine, saw a [substantial spike in violence](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/20/mexico-violence-gangs-cartels-criminal-elections) leading up to Mexico's June 6th election as cartels fought to influence the results.But don't just take my word for it - here it is straight from their [20-F](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001342874/9a1d9da4-87ff-484c-b50a-6ec71e90953e.pdf):""*In recent years, there have been high incidences of violence and crime related to drug trafficking in Mexico, including the Monterrey area in Nuevo León, where Ternium's main facilities are located, and Michoacán, where some of Ternium's mining facilities are placed. Although the Mexican government has implemented various security measures and has strengthened its military and police forces, drug-related crime continues to exist in Mexico. Security issues could affect Ternium's day-to-day operations and could also result in an economic slowdown, reducing domestic demand for its products and thereby having an adverse effect on Ternium's business. A deterioration of the security situation could result in significant obstacles or additional costs to the imple*mentation of growth plans in Mexico, including delays in the completion of capital expenditures.""
   * **My opinion is that this selloff will turn out to be overblown.** Cartel-influenced political unrest is a fact of life in Mexico, and the runup to these elections was in fact [less bloody than 2018's.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/26/more-than-100-politicians-murdered-in-mexico-ahead-of-election.html) With the election behind us, the Mexican news cycle will likely revert to normal.
   * Ternium also operates in relatively unstable sociopolitical environments outside of Mexico, most notably Venezuela. Luckily, in 2009 the [Venezuelan government purchased all but 10%](https://venezuelanalysis.com/news/4432) of Ternium's stake in the their largest Venezuelan steel operation, SIDOR, for $1.97 Billion. This greatly reduced their assets at risk in the region.
* The Risk of Tariff Removals
   * Additionally, Ternium faces the same general risks that any steel producer does in this environment. **There is some speculation that removal of the TEA Section 232 tariffs would impact their pricing power in the US.** This is unlikely, as steel prices and mill backlogs [are at record highs across the globe](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-11/steel-s-massive-rally-is-hitting-all-parts-of-the-global-economy) \- the European and Asian markets would not have sufficient export supply to depress North American prices, especially not with China stepping back from the picture.Even if the Asian and European markets did have the capacity to export to the Americas in meaningful numbers, they wouldn't/t be able to get it their without charging comparably high prices. **Container shipping rates** [**have tripled in the past year, and dry bulk has taken off as well.**](http://freightwaves.com) **There is no** [**current end in sight**](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/why-stratospheric-container-rates-could-rocket-even-higher) **to these shipping hikes.**

&#x200B;

[HARPEX's Container Index. Probably not a bad idea to invest in container as well.](https://preview.redd.it/jgz4kr2b7r571.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=815a97624766a2538f812cf6d5f55c927b9d919e)

The [Fleet-to-Orderbook](https://splash247.com/container-shippings-orderbook-to-fleet-ratio-rates-up-to-15/) ratio in container shipping is also at it's highest since the early 2010's - and it will take time to bring on new capacity onboard.

# Closing Thoughts:

The current environment looks exceptionally favorable for the steel industry over the next few years. The Covid-19 Pandemic precipitated a prefect storm of increased demand, record inventory lows, industry consolidation, and shipping bottlenecks that promise to keep steel pricing high for the foreseeable future. So long as China doesn't decide to abruptly walk back its new trade and pollution policies, the global steel supply / demand imbalance will remain overwhelmingly in producer's favor. **Ternium has demonstrated its ability to be profitable and pay dividends in environments** **far less favorable than this one,** **and I think it presents an incredible buying opportunity in the wake of political unrest in Mexico.**

**Positions:**

20% of my accounts are in November 42c and 60c's - 42's for the liquidity and 60's because I got them cheap after rebalancing my portfolio this week. Ternium's options are pretty illiquid compared to the higher volume/ bigger cap stuff, so be careful not to get caught in a bad bid/ask spread. I plan to roll them out on a green day whenever longer-dated calls become available on the chain.

I may also be buying shares dependent on the guidance given at Q2's earnings.

For many of the same reasons listed above, I also believe that $STLD (Steel Dynamics), $NUE (Nucor), $CLF (Cleveland Cliffs), $SID (Companhia Siderurgica Nacional), $PKX (POSCO), $AMKBY (Maersk), $DAC (Danaos) and $ZIM (Zim) are good buys. I have call options in all but NUE, PKX, AMKBY, and DAC.

Thoughts and feedback are encouraged - Happy investing everybody, don't lose your wife's retirement."

2021-06-17 13:58:03,wallstreetbets,"I've been in TX commons for a few months now and with the dip today I'm considering dipping into margin to make it my largest position. Current largest positions swap between CLF, MT, and SPWR depending on the day.

I'm having a bunch of commons called away tomorrow, but I'm thinking of buying into this steel dip today using margin. So I'll pay it off tomorrow. Steel commons are already a huge part of my portfolio and I'm having a hard time deciding what to buy next.

I've sold some more CLF puts to take advantage of the huge IV, but am already holding plenty of commons. I keep hearing that MT is at a big discount, so it's tempting, but it's already one of the my largest positions. Which leaves TX and SCHN on discount. I'm leaning towards TX since it's just so discounted without any good discernible reason. Buying MT is also tempting still, since it seems to be a relatively safe crowd favorite. TX and MT also get me that international exposure I've been trying to lean towards. SCHN is a scrap dealer that is a potential buyout target, and is otherwise a safe bet. Thoughts/opinions?"

I was watching STLD and TX for a long while the last year. Waited too long to buy some TX but I've picked some up since and another tranche today. Here's hoping Biden can get some infrastructure happening before another bridge collapse.

NUE might be the better company all things equal, but they're too expensive for my liking. I like TX prospects and balance sheet much more than STLD.

Institutional investors clearly weren't scared of them in Q4 2020 or Q1 2021, so that begs the question ""whats changed?""

IMO, what changed was Mexico's news cycle and the social climate in the leadup to the election. That, and most everything got pummeled so far this week.

It can take awhile for the sentiment surrounding bloody elections to subside, but what's going to catapult them is when the steel industry finally divorces from other commodities - If Q2 earnings season doesn't do that, I can't imagine what would.

This company is already on every institution's scanners for value - they just need the green light to buy in."

That said, it's one of only two North American producers that are bringing on capacity this year - the 4.4 Million tons of annual hot rolled coil capacity at Pesqueria will up their total steel shipment capacity by 35% over what they shipped in 2019. They won't realize that full output until 2022, but that is a massive increase, and it's in one of their highest margin products in their highest value market.

Back then an ounce of gold was $20, for 10 gold coins you got a car, 100 gold coins got you a fine house. Gold will still do that today, but at $1900. So $2000 from back then would've turned from 100 gold coins or a house to a single gold coin.

It's even worse if we use 1970 and $35 per ounce as a comparison to today. You lost 99% of purchasing power to today, not just 6 dollars turning into one...

&#x200B;

FDR and Nixon killed fiscal responsibility and introduced inflation as a hidden super tax on savings to fuel unsustainable and unpayable government debt as well as massive money printing. The holy grail of all infinite money glitches. Except for the part where it failed every time. From the roman empire to the 53 documented modern cases of more than 130% of GDP debt ratio, out of which 52 ended with bankruptcy soon after and Japan suffering from unaffordable housing and children for 30 years."

I honestly believe small to midcap American and Canadian companies with innovation potential are going to see astronomical gains because of the combination of infrastructure spending and speculative investing. Money is going to be racing into these companies before it's too late. Companies such as Asensus Surgical (ASXC), Enthusiast Gaming (EGLX), AcuityAds (ATY), Flexible Solutions (FSI), Kelso (KIQ), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Meatech (MITC), UR Energy (URG), Agrify (AGFY), Vision Marine (VMAR), CNSL, CMLS, EBIX, Liquid Media (YVR), PKE, RMTI, FSTR, Genie Energy (GNE), GHM, GIFI, JAKK, LFVN, Aemetis (AMTX), ATNI, Audacy (AUD) and BBGI could likely fly over the next few years."

2021-06-17 12:45:40,wallstreetbets,"And who appointed Powell? Look it up. Hint: he has a bad orange tan and was the most incompetent president in history.

Isn’t it amusing how the Republicans never uttered a word about deficits when Trump massively increased it with a tax cut for the uber-wealthy? Isn’t it funny how they didn’t decry Trump’s Covid stimulus package. And even funnier that they think we don’t notice their utter hypocrisy (like when, with a straight face, they said Biden was bowing down to Putin — as if Trump’s four years of fawning over the Russian killer never happened). 

While this “Fed meeting recap” hopes to appear humorous, it probably came out of a Republican propaganda factory if not a Russian one. The facts are clear: Trump’s idiotic downplaying of the virus as a “hoax” and his mocking of people who wore masks contributed to the sharpest recession ever. Stimulus was needed. The Fed helped save the economy, which is roaring back. The Fed will taper QE and will bump up rates when needed. Everything will be ok — as long as we keep Republicrook politicians out of office. Republicans destroy. Dems build. Look up how the economy does when each is in power. Facts matter."

2021-06-17 17:45:23,wallstreetbets,"The high Debt/GDP is a problem, but easily correctable still. 1/3rd of that debt is unfunded Medicare and Social Security and the remainder is mainly from stimulus to prevent 2007/2008 + COVID and two wars + nation building - all one time events. Overall the US budget is actually balanced. The unfunded part can be fixed through an increase to the FICA tax, which I think will happen in the next decade, and the rest though a small tax increase. The US worker demographic is also strong, millennials/Gen-z/Gen-Alpha are huge populations of future tax payers, so we will not run into the issues Japan or China face.

As for the gold standard, that is a fringe movement for a reason. Rome’s collapse had little to do with it either… in fact Rome lasted until 1453AD, it just existed as the Byzantine Empire. The Rome we know of (western Rome) fell from rampant corruption, labor shortage, civil war, and yes inflation - but inflation only played a small role and caused by government spending when goods were sparse (labor shortage), not due to what the money was pegged to. Look at Spain, they had inflation after the discovery of the new world due to having too much gold. Gold doesn’t make you immune to inflation if demand outstrips supply for goods, it is economics 101.

FDR and Nixon also had low Debt/GDP ratios if you compare them to other developed nations in their time. Inflation was high, but that was due to macro economic reasons (WW2/post-WW2 for FDR, although he died before post-war - Oil Embargo of Nixon).

2021-06-17 19:29:31,wallstreetbets,"No. In Canada, 95%+ of mortgages are 5 years fixed rates,   25 years terms. Since the big buying boom hapened after they lowered the key rate and the other rates followed, most of people who bought an overpriced  house at a ridiculously low rate will be fine for at least 5 years. Yes they will need to deal with inflation, but the biggest expense in the budget will at least be at a low rate for 5 years. So from 4-6 years depending on when they bought, it will catch up to a lot of people. 

I think the market will slowly calm down and some people will start having problems before 5 years, but i expect it too become too much when theres a wave of people all at once who suddently cant pay. 

I mean, houses evaluation cycle is also due to start in 2021 , so the taxes they pay now will also go up after new evaluations. 

So inflation, plus higher taxes, and at 4-6 years boom new way higher mortgage rates. All of this together will be too much. 

And there we are my gf and i looking for a house ahahah stupid me."

Their net income is down 93.94%, their Net profit margin dropped by 16% last year, their operating income is down 133%, and their net change in cash is -400%.  (source: google finance).   Seriously I have no idea why anyone would buy this stock, except FOMO.   PLTR at least has long term potential.  CLNE as well.  CLOV too (plus mega squeeze potential due to an ongoing investigation that caused high short interest).  Plenty of others are worth looking into IMO.  This one is not though.

2021-06-16 23:58:09,wallstreetbets,I hope you get what you bought. I’ve ordered from there in the past and more than once my package has gotten lost in transit (from China) 🤣

2021-06-16 23:50:48,wallstreetbets,It’s already been at 30$ this year 🤷🏼‍♂️
2021-06-16 23:23:24,wallstreetbets, what's the play with wish?
2021-06-17 12:11:35,wallstreetbets,"This guy spreads fud, look at his comment history"
2021-06-16 23:48:26,wallstreetbets,"Don’t worry.. those are the hedgies seeding Fud in this sub. 
As a matter of fact, this sub has been overtaken by the hedgies."

2021-06-16 23:31:53,wallstreetbets,Why a smart move? I've seen a couple post about Wish but this is courageous. I hope it works out you/him. AMC 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-16 23:46:44,wallstreetbets,I wish I sold all my amc for that price. Started selling amc at 19$ and just sold the last of my amc at 57$. I’ve made a big transfer out of Robinhood as well. What proof do you need lol
2021-06-16 23:41:48,wallstreetbets,22 days old account! Hahhahha. Suck my dick shill. 😐

2021-06-16 23:31:10,wallstreetbets,I agree what ever makes us money for sure
2021-06-17 17:14:37,wallstreetbets,"That's the thing, you need to sell and reinvest the profits if you want to make money, instead of pointlessly bagholding stocks that where way past their peak and missing out on making money with other stocks that could shoot up, just because you believe in the hivemind that says you are supposed to hold and keep buying more.

The millions of retards who flooded this place since January don't understand this concept and believes all of this is a team sport and don't understand why they are losing money."
2021-06-16 23:19:02,wallstreetbets,But there are only 2 good stocks so…
2021-06-17 10:42:21,wallstreetbets,Wrong...i hate that move..GME/AMC or move the fuck on.
2021-06-17 17:40:58,wallstreetbets,Thank you for saying this
2021-06-17 11:51:41,wallstreetbets,"He sold, we bought. Today seems to be a green day for AMC anyways."
2021-06-17 00:03:01,wallstreetbets,"Whose we? We believe WISH is a pump and dump lol

Follow main stream media much? They are pumping this sucker for a reason"
2021-06-17 04:50:24,wallstreetbets,Ima broke a$$ poor and put what I had in AMC. ima let these rich kids play their games.
2021-06-17 06:51:52,wallstreetbets,I feel like all you have to do is actually USE wish to buy a product and youll have an answer. That shit is practically a scam
2021-06-17 00:26:26,wallstreetbets,crossing my fingers   lol we will see .  I have ordered form baba too it took like 3 months also .   hehe
2021-06-17 09:54:20,wallstreetbets,Lmao my package from Wish from May 2020 still hasn’t came 😂😂💀
2021-06-17 12:40:24,wallstreetbets,"""Lately?"" I've been proudly sporting a foil-lined deerstalker for decades because I keep being right."
2021-06-16 23:16:54,wallstreetbets,No problem daddy
2021-06-16 23:20:54,wallstreetbets,Zachs calls are on point
2021-06-17 07:25:48,wallstreetbets,Wish might be a solid play. But not solid enough to jump out of AMC for
2021-06-17 01:11:38,wallstreetbets,Well I guess you've been straight pumped to the tits for a little while.
2021-06-16 23:57:26,wallstreetbets,This is the way

2021-06-16 23:54:12,wallstreetbets,"A shill? My mans was in AM* at $10 and you call him a Shill?? You WISH !!

This is WSB not… GME/AMC|BETS  

Y’all needa let other ppl like other stocks 

So much hate… AMC got a bunch of hate when GME was the king. Now-GME and AMC are royalty kings and WISH might just be the prince 

*might* be"

2021-06-17 00:03:07,wallstreetbets,yeah but not often a company could end up banned from using USPS to ship its products.
2021-06-17 06:26:45,wallstreetbets,"AMC is sky high, at best it will double for you from where it was yesterday... at worst you lose 80%. Wish can 2x or 3x and you might lose 40% but thats my opinion"
2021-06-16 23:53:20,wallstreetbets,"Mods usually ask for receipts of trades. Idk man ask a mod. Just making sure this isn't FUD.

 If you sold: Congrats and fuck you"
2021-06-17 12:21:41,wallstreetbets,"It just seems like this is FUD towards AMC. To each his own, looks like I’m getting down-voted by motley fool morons too :P"
2021-06-17 17:31:44,wallstreetbets,100% agree.
2021-06-17 02:11:49,wallstreetbets,Which 2 are it though right now is the question.
2021-06-17 11:24:24,wallstreetbets,Then u a scrub and what is wrong with this sub. It’s not called GME and AMC bets.
2021-06-17 01:31:49,wallstreetbets,🎯🎯🎯

2021-06-17 00:30:56,wallstreetbets,"So *your man* was in AMC, you say. What about you Mr. Diamond hands 🥴 ?"
2021-06-16 23:57:50,wallstreetbets,"We are struggling to contain the HF manipulations on amc.. & yet you guys post saying “I sold AMC” .. wat does that make you if not a shill ? I don’t give a shit whether you bought at $10 or $1 .. if you want to sell go ahead & sell but please don’t post it if you really “care about AMC” . Other wise, we 🦍s here at AMC will be tempted to call out the __paper handed bitches...__"
2021-06-16 23:29:31,wallstreetbets,No one takes anything seriously here lol.

2021-06-17 01:09:59,wallstreetbets,"Yessir and look where it’s at now. If I’m wrong on WISH… so be it. I’d rather be wrong and have entry at bottom than watch it run and deal with the Fomo 

I missed GME, got a pice of UAL and AMC.

WISH… I’m am fully prepared for as all the stars are twinkling just like GME and AMC pre-squeeze"
2021-06-17 03:39:41,wallstreetbets,I still do. 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-17 01:14:46,wallstreetbets,"My guy, I only got a small part of AMC and not with a good entry so hell no I have not Diamond handed HOWEVER wish is at/near all time lows and has had all time high volume this past week 

ALSO - Neva said I had Diamond hands fu, so not sure why you’re calling me that  💅🏼 

Volume tends to precede price. Stock is still at a decent entry."
2021-06-17 00:15:21,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, I get it. That’s why people don’t usually announce sells. I Wish OP hadn’t mentioned his sell but it is what it is. you also need to understand better what FUD and SHILL means. You did not use the two words correctly in describing OP"
2021-06-17 01:48:52,wallstreetbets,LOL who hurt you?!
2021-06-17 00:23:53,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THE WAY. Every 🦍 knows and this just proves it’s shill bs. I thought I was retarded but selling AMC before the squeeze is the most retarded shit I’ve ever heard. 😂 Good luck!
2021-06-16 23:30:04,wallstreetbets,Well it's either that or take over the world
2021-06-17 00:48:47,wallstreetbets,"So, you post a lot of shit in a month lol Let the man do as he pleases. If he misses Valhalla that on him."

However you may get some buck because the market is killing us who play base on WSB but today pre market is negative (0.38) down and 82.67 with 2 days left to your options.

I hope you gain big buck on this puts."

And the former US SoC and ambassador to China. When Chinese box offices certainly played a massive part is helping both AMC and IMAX weather the pandemic prefrenzy.  


Hate the share issuance, but it's good for the company and shareholders have six months.

An Amazon buyout looks further by the day. But at this point it's not needed."

2021-06-17 08:47:02,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck would Amazon EVER purchase a theater chain. They just acquired MGM didn't they? They want the streaming power.
2021-06-17 11:41:35,wallstreetbets,"They already had streaming power. What they don't have is prestige.  
They need subsidized theater space to distribute their streaming films.  
Because streaming counts as television and isn't qualified to win Oscars.

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$DKNG is gonna pop once football season starts This is the first year after DraftKings signed an exclusive contract with the NFL. There is going to be an absurd amount of commercials and advertising. More states have passed legalized gambling in the off-season. There is so much promise for the upcoming year, which is precisely why Cathie Wood keeps dumping INSANE amounts of money into it. Their year over year growth is around 70%. They have more people using their service (8 million+) than any of their competitors by FAR. DraftKings revenue is more than its closest 4 competitors COMBINED. They have more options than Fanduel with PPR and higher stakes. They do pay an absurd amount on advertising, which is why their numbers are skewed. However, they are doubling down on themselves trying to be the first thought of when it comes to betting on sports and it is working. Eventually, gambling will essentially all be online because of the convenience of it. It’s a win win for me. Not a pump and dump. Not a quick buck. It’s a long term investment that I will continue putting money into."

DKNG has massive revenue right now and only access to 25% of the U.S. population. Wait until they reach everyone, this market is going to explode no matter where you’re invested.

I mean just in the last 24 hours I've only dropped $300 on DKNG to draft 15 $20 NFL Best Ball teams.  By ""fooOOTBalLL SEaASson"" I will have already maxed out the draft limit, IDIOT!"
2021-06-17 00:03:23,wallstreetbets,Do you actually think this isn't common knowledge? lol. Literally everyone knows this and it's already priced into the stock. When their NFL partnership was announced it pumped 5%. It's not going to change once football season starts.
2021-06-17 00:04:05,wallstreetbets,Liar
2021-06-17 15:39:41,wallstreetbets,IDEX do your DD going to the moon
2021-06-17 08:46:57,wallstreetbets,"Ok listen up. This “exclusive” deal dkng had to pay for. It’s is marketing and advertising and I’m sure they paid a fuck ton for it. You think I use Midas because they are the official brake pads of the NFL. The agreement was just that dkng pays the NFL to be the official sponsor. 

No as far as commercials those are owned by the network. There will be a plethora of commercials for all betting sites. Maybe the NFL network channel may limit other betting sites commercials on their channel but I don’t believe that is prudent. 

Now dkng is absurdly overvalued. No one is denying that trading at 3x mgm, lvs, ceasars group and still losing a ton of money. They will continue to loss money which is fine as they go after customer acquisition. However, this is a very competitive space and they casinos have a fuck tom of money to throw at it and they can offer insane comps for brand loyalty. 

Not only will dkng not be profitable anytime soon they are in a market in which one can actually lose money. Sportsbooks arent anywhere close to a casinos moneymaker. Now even with x percent of gross gain on casino they have to give almost 5% of gross to the state (depending on the state) to operate a sportsbook. So their margins are capped.

Fair value today is 20 bucks. Fair value when the fed removes eight trillion from their balance sheet and raises interest to 3% is 5 bucks. Probably, besides riot, the easiest short in the market."
2021-06-17 02:26:52,wallstreetbets,That's bananas
2021-06-16 22:44:33,wallstreetbets,That’s a good thing bud

2021-06-16 22:46:37,wallstreetbets,They have PPR and higher stakes than fanduel. They have twice the users and now an exclusive advertising contract with the biggest sport in the US.
2021-06-16 23:00:14,wallstreetbets,"I have used pretty much all of the different apps a ton. Draft kings is a better product then any of them and it's not really close. There are others entering the market, but the market is growing and growing and I don't see anyone unseating draft kings as the leader"
2021-06-17 01:04:42,wallstreetbets,Have you used fanduel? There servers went down hours before the Super Bowl and tons of people couldn’t even place bets. They are literal dog shit. I used to use them and moved to DraftKings because I couldn’t take the outages and shitty customer service anymore.

2021-06-16 23:37:36,wallstreetbets,Bro you’re literally making yourself sound dumb. The point of investing is for FUTURE growth. If you want to pump and dump then keep going with meme stocks. This is an actual investment. And it has a sportsbook it’s not strictly fantasy PeA bRaIn

2021-06-17 11:09:13,wallstreetbets,This whole garbage of a comment is so wrong I’m not even going into it. You’re talking about casinos right now like of course they make more there are only a quarter of states that can legally bet on sports through their phones. You just said a whole lot of nothing.
2021-06-17 06:35:49,wallstreetbets,For apes

2021-06-16 23:39:56,wallstreetbets,"Wish they had NBA, playoffs are fan duel spot every commercial break with hawkward “games” that Inside the NBA play and talk about Fanduel. Football has peaked."
2021-06-16 22:50:39,wallstreetbets,Many of the best sports betting podcasts and media outlets are sponsored by fanduel and they’re creating an impressive ecosystem. I’m long on several online sports betting companies but you should also keep in mind the companies that are supplying the stats.
2021-06-17 02:01:36,wallstreetbets,Is fanduel public
2021-06-16 23:03:27,wallstreetbets,"I 100% agree, last season, I finished first betting the the r/sportsbook NFL competition. I primarily use offshore or “illegal” bookies, and by far, DKNG is the next best thing.

I still prefer Bovada to DKNG, but DKNG is by far my favorite legal book, no question."
2021-06-16 23:28:10,wallstreetbets,They tried and were blocked by the FTC. It’s literally on draftkings wiki
2021-06-16 23:27:59,wallstreetbets,No the FDA canceled it like 5 years ago. They attempted a merger tho

2021-06-16 23:42:36,wallstreetbets,It’s peaked yet viewership blows the nba out of the water. The NFL will have the exact same thing with draft kings this year and no fan duel allowed
2021-06-17 06:21:23,wallstreetbets,Nobody watches the nba lol.
2021-06-16 23:09:17,wallstreetbets,"Nice! I didn't know r/sportsbook had a competition, I'll have to check that out. I like Bovada as well, but for the daily fantasy stuff, draft kings is where it's at. Their player retention programs are really good too."
2021-06-17 02:02:26,wallstreetbets,Dkng doesnt offer same game parlays which sucks

2021-06-16 23:10:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man, its on their discord, they have contests all the time. I won $800."
2021-06-16 23:47:53,wallstreetbets,All good bro! Whenever I invest I have to look at the competition and draftkings and fanduel are always on top. But I’ve also been listening to a bunch of the ringer podcasts and fantasy sports podcast and all they talk about is fanduel. I can just imagine that noobs getting into sports betting will listen to these people talk and join whatever platform these people endorse. Just kind makes you wish draftkings ups their ad game. Sucks that fanduel is on OTC market
2021-06-17 00:54:07,wallstreetbets,"It's common knowledge for the competent investor. Literally anyone who puts any effort into research can see Draft Kings will benefit from football season.

Open a brokerage account with Vanguard and invest in index funds. Do not invest in individual stocks, because that is gambling.

Do you have a 401k plan at work? Do you qualify to open an IRA? You should always start by maxing out tax advantaged retirement accounts before touching brokerage accounts."

2021-06-17 11:08:02,wallstreetbets,I believe our current issue with inflation is created mostly by the loose monetary policy of the Fed. Yes the pandemic added to supply issues but there are too many dollars chasing to few of products produced. Also the never ending spending of our government.
2021-06-17 16:28:44,wallstreetbets,the Federal Reserve is very upset that no new wars have been started for some time.  Inflation will go up until people start killing each other again.

2021-06-17 17:31:44,wallstreetbets,">The “owner’s equivalent rent of residence” accounts for 24.2% of CPI. If it had increased by 10.4%, in line with the Case-Shiller index, instead of 2.0%, the overall CPI would have increased by 2.03 percentage points more. So add the 2.03 percentage points to the reported overall CPI increase of 1.7%. And the thus corrected overall CPI would have shot up by 3.7%!

Nancy: Have you ever gone on vacation and left your child home?
Silas : No, no. But I did leave one at a funeral parlor once.

Gus Polinski : Yeah, it was awful. The wife was distraught and we left the little tyke there in the funeral parlor all day. All day. You know, we went back at night and apparently he had been alone all day with the corpse. He was okay though, after two, three weeks he came around and started talking again."

2021-06-17 09:27:40,wallstreetbets,"Options are basically speculation and provide multiples for your investment. Call Option is a contract that gives you the right not the obligation to buy shares at specific time if the option hits a strike a price. If you don’t hit that strike price by the time the option expires then your option becomes worthless. Options also decline in value over time which is called theta decay. A call option basically has the buyer assuming the price will go up. You don’t need to wait for the strike price or expiration to sell the option contract for either a profit or loss. If you do hit the strike price, that’s called in the money. At this point you can exercise the option to buy the shares lower than market value for a profit. If it doesn’t hit the strike price and you held out till expiration then you’re fucked and lose everything you invested in that option. This is why options/derivatives market is considered betting akin to a casino. Hedge funds and other huge investors like to manipulate the market so they can artificially push down the price. Betting against a stock is called “shorting”. Some will use “put options” to short a stock. It’s safer than actually shorting a stock because you can only lose what you invested. Shorting losses can be unlimited and you have to have the shares to cover those you shorted. This is where the squeeze comes in. If all the outstanding shares are held by investors and no one is selling, they will have to try to buy shares to cover their shitty bet or be exposed to massive amounts of losses/debt/scrutiny for not covering such bets. This is naked short selling.  This is just my understanding and I’m a retard. Everything I said is basically gibberish. Use investopedia, good resource for explanations."

2021-06-17 11:54:16,wallstreetbets,"The very basic idea of options is simple: You are buying (or selling) the OPTION to buy or sell a stock in the future for a price you agree upon today.

Let’s say you’re thinking about buying a bike. However, you think the price of the bike you want will go up next week. You could just buy the bike today and hope it’s worth more next week. Or maybe, you can go to a bike shop and work a deal where you give them $10 now, as a fee, for the option to buy the bike next week at today’s price. Then you wait a week and see if the price of the bike went up, down, or sideways. If the bike is more expensive, then you exercise your option to buy it at last week’s price. Good deal for you! If the price is cheaper, then you obviously don’t want to pay last week’s price and the option expires. It cost you $10 either way in “premium” (fee)."

Shitburg says gray market = big bad

State Regulators say gray market = not that bad

—————————————————————————

Morgan Stanley analyst Thomas Allen wrote in a note, **“‘Unregulated’ market exposure is a common theme for [international] online gaming / sports betting companies.”**

“Allen also said that in April 2016, the **New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement issued a policy letter that drew a clear line between gray market exposure—permissible for operators—and illegal market exposure.** SBTech, the analyst said, operates in gray markets. DraftKings is based in Boston, but New Jersey’s stance appeared to set a precedent for how other regulators might handle the issue.”

“Stauff said that “All European/U.K.-based bookmakers operate in gray/black markets throughout the world, and it certainly doesn’t surprise us that SB-Tech did as well **(even the biggest bookmakers today have ~20% exposure in ‘unregulated’ markets which include gray/black).””**


—————————————————————————
Crazy. So tl;dr, the standard for NJ (and other states) is that gray or unregulated market exposure is somewhat expected for legal books, you just cant endorse it? 

I’d be interested in seeing how the other major books stack up as while, especially Fan duel with their heavy European influence. Basically this analyst is insisting that all bookies have exposure to illegal markets."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$XPEV DD - A True EV/AV Company In the EV Market, there are an increasing number of players vying for market share, so how is one to know which is the company to own if they wanted to consider investing?
 
The answer is simply....research. And today, I'd like to share some of my own thoughts based on the research I have done to date.
 
1. Tesla has arguably been the King in the EV Space for some time now and minted some individuals a tidy profit if they stuck with the company through thick and thin. Being first in this space from a mass production standpoint, has worked well for them. However the crown is starting to tarnish. 
There are quality concerns, and recently the Model 3 lost Consumer Reports Top Pick Status and IIHS Safety Award after stripping features. Safety concerns with the Model 3 is a big PR problem especially in the world's largest market...China. 

China is also worried about government employees owning Teslas due to perceived security concerns with surveillance. 

One also must acknowledge that Tesla makes its money, not from selling cars, but from the ""regulatory credits"" it gets from governments around the world in their push to reduce carbon emissions. Since Tesla only sells electric vehicles, they get these credits for free and can sell them at a huge profit to other auto manufacturers who can't meet environmental targets. It's big $ for Tesla, but what one cannot look away from is the fact that Tesla IS NOT profitable from selling its cars. At least, not yet.

2. Now on to Chinese Car manufacturers...and there are quite a few. The big names are Buffet-loved and held, BYD. Li Auto which is relatively new, NIO which has some similar roots to Xpeng Motors, but isn't the same. All mentioned here are true EV plays.

Xpeng/Tesla, and the race to autonomous driving. 

3. Autonomous Vehicles is truly the next play in this market and a necessary move for vehicles to go in. Removing driver error is huge for safety and will save insurance companies a TON of money. And in the AV space, the race is between Tesla and Xpeng.

4. Not long ago, Musk charged Xpeng for stealing proprietary tech after a senior engineer left Tesla to join the Xpeng Team. Same was said about a senior Apple engineer who left Apple's Car R&D division and joined Xpeng as well. Tesla sued the engineer and the linchpin was on the AV tech housed in Xpeng's XPILOT software. Tesla argued that their tech was in their software. 
In the end, both companies agreed to allow an independent tech arbitrator to view both company's AV source code, and guess what....it was proven that both Tesla and Xpeng have their own source codes that were designed by their own R&D efforts, and nothing was stolen or was being shared. That was BIG News!!

5. Xpeng in the quest toward Phase 5 self driving cars, liked the safety and accuracy that LiDar tech provides. Musk, on the other hand, scoffed at LiDar for years calling it a 'fool's' play. However, years later, Musk is now conceding there is something to LiDar and may even be developing with it.

But here is the rub, Xpeng has it, is using it, and their software works very very well with all the various sensors combined. Their new model, the P5, was showcased at the Shanghai Auto Show, complete with LiDar, and that show gave Xpeng 10,000 pre orders on reveal day alone. I can only imagine how that number has grown since, and in October, deliveries begin.

6. Xpeng has a new manufacturing facility set to go online in December of this year which will ramp up the ability to produce more cars. In 2022, they also have plans for 2-3 new models, one of which will be a new SUV type.

7. In the race toward full autonomous vehicle capabilities, Xpeng is targeting 2025 as the year for this to be fully operational, safe and complete. That said, they are logging thousands upon thousands of accident free XPILOT driver assisting kilometers with their cars doing a lot of the driving without needing help from the driver. No sleeping behind the wheel yet, but they are charting a significant course towards getting this done!

Tesla? Well...when was the last time you heard of an accident or life lost? Probably not long ago, so they still have  a long ways to go I think, and now Musk is backpeddling on his timelines for full AV capabilities. 

SCALE 

8. Like China or not, with the GREEN push throughout the world and everything drivable going electric, there really is only ONE country that can help to meet the demand...China. They are a manufacturing powerhouse, and Xpeng is ramping up to get the world and humanity, the cars they need.

SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE

9. A big hope for Tesla is that they can sell the software for their cars to have the capabilities they “can"" have. You want software assisted driving? That’s going to cost you like 4 grand as an option. It’s smart, if it works well.
Xpeng has a similar hope, but is really successful already in this strategy. They also deploy OTA upgrades on what seems to be a weekly basis almost, which is exciting like when your phone gets an Over-the-Air update and new features, that same excitement is happening with XPeng’s car owners, and it is translating into more sales. 

And while we are on the topic of sales, you can’t help but notice that Xpeng was the first Chinese EV Car company to start selling vehicles in Europe in Norway, and plan to expand their distribution in more parts of Europe before the year is over. 

In Conclusion...
 
Xpeng is an impressive company with huge goals for itself and they make technologically superior vehicles from many different angles. Entertainment, Drivability, Safety, Comfort, etc.
 
I remember reading a quote of a comment that He Xiaopeng (Xpeng CEO and Founder) said to Musk, and it went something like this...""We will destroy you in China, and we will be an absolute nuisance to you in Europe,"" and I think it won't be long, if not already, that He Xiaopeng lives up to his statement. 
 
Xpeng is worth a serious look and currently has price targets north of $50 USD. A great opportunity for a company of purchasing value today. Do your own research and I think you will come to see the true Tesla competitor, if not successor!

If you go to china you will see they are still crazy about western brands and white skin. The country is still filled with unspeakable poverty outside the 10 big cities

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: $ET bullish volume into the close for the last 3 days I've been tracking growing bullish sentiment on $ET (Energy Transfer) for the last week and caught these end of day multi-million dollar candles at market close.

At around $11 for 4 million shares, that's nearly $50 million trading hands. (ThinkOrSwim screenshot below)

I'm struggling to understand why there would be that much buying interest in Market On Close execution. Assuming these were no-limit orders, the buyer(s) received absolutely terrible fills. 

As of now I have a few ideas:

* Someone is avoiding overnight gap risk because they are
   * short a large number of shares
   * short a large number of calls
* Dealers are hedging greeks at the close and don't care about quality order fills
   * The open interest for calls vs puts is around 10:1 right now, so the order flow is incredibly bullish
* A large buyer is intentionally forcing a positive uptick right into low overnight liquidity to give their call options a push

2021-06-16 22:23:04,wallstreetbets,Thats what I've been doing too for a few months now but as a PMCC against a 5c Jan 2023 LEAPS. I also closed some other positions this week and bought more MVIS shares so that in my taxable portfolio I am all in on MVIS. I am transferring my RH portfolio to my TDA portfolio where I have another 7 MVIS shares tomorrow and then my positions will be +1 5c Jan 2023 & 99 shares. Oncethe transfer is compete I'll sell one CC against my leap for enough to buy more shares and then I'll be able to start selling an extra CC every week to accumulate more shares! Let's go MVIS!!

Practice with less money instead of spending huge amounts gambling when you dont even know the true risk involved. It's like buying a $25,000 lottery ticket that has 0.00001% chance... you might pay $1 or $10 but why $25,000 damn people please this is embarrassing and hurtful to see."

Go green, make green, print green. Oh also they rode strong through covid, have beat earnings recently, and Brazil is primed for economic rebound from the pandemic.

^(That was a really long TL;DR and I apologize for that. I know some of you don't have the patience to string 20 words together in an intelligible fashion and that's why people like me exist; to string 20 words together into what appears to be an intelligent thought. Disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm doing and this is not financial advice.)

Hello again apes, cows, 4th time ev enthusiasts, and iTub pre-orderers,

# ITUB filed a 6K today with the SEC that contained a gem of an announcement for the company, a mega investment in a green future...

Firstly, for those who have been inside larping on the internet all day, ITUB is a Brazilian mega bank (largest private bank) who has been repositioning themselves as a FinTech recently with much success. You can read another DD from my profile on the company or one of several others on this sub that are much better.

Now for the green stuff, I'll let the 6K do the talking...

**$400 billion in green investments by 2025.** That's about $150 billion annually invested into credit in sectors such as health, environment, infrastructure, etc. I've seen a metric fuck load of virtue signaling on here in the name of renewables and cow farts in the last 2 weeks and I love to see it. Here we have a fucking mega corp putting their money forward to encourage this in Brazil; a developing country market larger than most in the world. 

# ""That's great, what a bunch of tree hugging rainbow bears. Do they make money?"" Yes, they do; fuck loads.

Brazil was a hot spot for the pandemic and they struggled for a long time getting their arms around it. They're one of the last major (by population) nations in the world to get back on their feet. Sounds like a great time to invest in the largest private bank in the country that's repositioning itself as a FinTech, right? Right. **Earnings since covid:**

\- Aug 2020: nearly recovered on revenue, less miss on EPS than May

\- Nov 2020: nearly recovered on revenue, beat EPS

**- Feb 2021 & May 2021: Beats across the board, well ahead of the curve in Brazil**

# ""Yeah retard, they make money because they're huge. We can't gain anything here."" Wrong - let me show you something....

A few weeks ago, big buyers started piling into call options just outside the money. These big players have been anticipating Brazil's recovery, are appreciative of ITUB's strategy to expand digital and financial services, and are almost always in position ahead of time. **Take a look at just July call options:**

Similar stories in August at the $7 and $8 strike levels. September's are filling up too. The June FD warriors sitting at the $7 strike level are some kind of special, but these July's and August's are doable for a stock that's bouncing back along with Brazil as a whole. **Bonus: the calls are still dirt cheap, under $0.10 in some cases.**

There have been massive whale buys in the last couple days, via level 2 data, in the range of 60,000 - 100,000 shares in some cases. This thing moves only with big pushes and we've seen some of those come in. Another user put it best today; **This is a waking giant.**

See you on the moon.   🚀

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CLF - Strong Uptrend - Great Setup - Optimal Entry Points ***TL;DR*** *-* Strong uptrend on the daily chart, buy on the lower red line

Falling wedge on the 2 hour - breaks out above **22.65** targeting **23.74 --> 25.00**, invalid under **21.84**

Huge trendline on the monthly chart - use it as a price target for the future assuming we go parabolic

\---

Keep in mind, technical analysis is a roadmap, not a crystal ball. I'm going to list the areas that provide the highest probability entries - with the best risk/reward ratios. I'm NOT going to give you some story about why this stock is going to 10x next week.

Anyway - here's the daily chart:

[$CLF 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/hizy0v8ttp571.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=841c03a6ee0c5774c7a03852208b0afe0afe31c1)

Extremely simple setup here. It's just a rising channel - and a strong one at that. We've had many confirmed reactions on both ends of it. You can see our most recent down move was caused by a test of the top end.

Now, we are oscillating towards the lower end - and filling in this volume from **21.84 - 21.03.** That's the zone that needs to hold before we go for a test of the lower red line. However - **as long as the lower red line** **is intact - the trend is** **clearly up -** and probability is with you on the long side.

For an optimal entry - I would look for a test of said line. You could stop out on a daily close below it and get away with hardly any losses - but your maximum gain in this scenario is **potentially astronomical.**

Alternatively - you could enter in this 21.84 - 21.03 demand zone - but it's a bit riskier.

However - by mid-July - that demand zone and the red trendline will **line up perfectly** \- which makes for the **highest probability entry** possible. Although, I know (next to) none of you are that patient.

Keep in mind - these are **mid term entries** (1-3 month holds).

Also note - a majority of the volume peaks since February were on green candles. **This is supportive of the uptrend.**

It's always good to look at both sides of the story and get an unbiased look - so keep in mind: if we do break that red line down, the uptrend would no longer be intact, and said play would be invalid.

Next let's zoom in a bit and take a look at what's going on with this recent downtrend:

[$CLF 20D 2h](https://preview.redd.it/hm2ay84gvp571.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=734b82f6d49967c7a874f9c07212923aa6bad745)

You can see we've actually formed a pretty decent falling wedge. Assuming we don't drop hard by open - it should break out tomorrow. This would be a solid entry for a **short term hold** (1-2 days). We would need a 2 hour close above **22.65** tomorrow. I would use **22.05** as a stop loss.

The targets for this setup are much more defined - and would look at **23.74** first (take half off) - then target **25.00.**

This short term setup is invalid below **21.84.**

Lastly, I want to take a look at the long long term - the maxed out monthly chart - since steel companies have quite a history:

[$CLF Max Month](https://preview.redd.it/f7r98r58wp571.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=06cbee8c1bffe5710ad60f1e7bc99703e26796a8)

Here - you can see we are actually still in a downtrend dating back to **2008.** This is completely irrelevant in the near-term, even in the next few months - but it does one thing.

That massive trendline can be used as a logical target for the current up move - and a great exit price. If we were to stay in the uptrend the entire time (unlikely) - it would land us at about **32.15** by Feb 2022.

Upon reaching this - it is likely to act as very, very strong resistance. If we wanted to break it - we would probably consolidate sideways for some time. If we did break it - we could see a ridiculously large move in this name - targeting **50** or more.

Of course this is very far out in the future - but food for thought.

*Not Financial Advice*

2021-06-16 22:29:01,wallstreetbets,"Well done. 

What attracted me to CLF is we are just starting to see the break through of the top Bollinger band calculated on the 20 year timeline.

I don't think the Fed will be raising rates anytime soon, but the Fed action has opened the door to action if inflation gets bad. That simple possibility is making a lot of big money jumpy, and probably emboldens shorts. So, there'll prolly be additional volatility. I remain a buyer of $CLF. JMHO"

2021-06-17 04:24:46,wallstreetbets,"Prices probably will drop but will still be at historic highs. Read the new released forward guidance the CEO used $1150 as a price for the rest of the year. Right now we are $1650+, futures say $1300 and futures are increasing everyday. China is rumored to add an export tax. Which will be great for EU and American steel! The future is very bright!"

2021-06-17 10:57:37,wallstreetbets,I know OTM means out of the money. What is a leap? My goal is to grab like 10-20% returns.
2021-06-17 11:44:48,wallstreetbets,"Taking a guess, alot of the tickers on WSB don't really have favorable charts overall (or fundamentals)"
2021-06-17 11:05:06,wallstreetbets,"a leaps is an option with far out expiry, so you dont necessarily have to worry about timing as much."
2021-06-17 12:01:03,wallstreetbets,"well - a lot of people like to think there is no scenario where their play doesn't work out - and i always give both sides - which im guessing rubs people the wrong way

but - too much conviction in any one play is a surefire way to kill your port"
2021-06-17 12:07:03,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely!

Being convinced like that also leads you to failing to take profit on the rips.

I am so glad I did that with CLF this round.

Oh, and you might want to take a look at TSLA.

It looks like we will see a death cross in a couple of months, give or take."
2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"There are two ways to build the biggest building in town. One is by actually building the biggest building in town ($RKT) and the other way is by tearing all of the other buildings down ($UWMC). Actually building the biggest building historically wins in the end which is why I'm betting on $RKT Alright apes so here is the deal. I wanted to play nice, I wanted everyone to win those big juicy tendies, no matter how they get them, but I heard something in the Jim Crammer interviews with UWMC CEO  that stuck with me and is preposterous. It was not even the $5,000 penalty ultimatum $UWMC imposed if any of their mortgage brokers does business with $RKT  (which was a dick move to begin with more on that later) but rather the CEO's answer when he was asked in the second interview ""how he is going to take on $RKT to become the top mortgage lender by 2024"" . Mat's answer was ""$RKT revenue is going to decrease on ours is going to increase because $RKT will lose money as interest rates go up because their business is 94% refinance"" here are my two reasons why this is not a winning strategy or accurate guidance from the CEO:

1. Let's start with this dumb $5,000 penalty ultimatum. Mat Ishbia UWMC CEO is trying to ""protect the broker channel"" by encouraging consumers looking for a loan or refinance to always go through a broker as opposed to going on an app like ""Rocket Mortgage"" which cuts out the middle man broker (link to interview below). Mat's argument is if you are a mortgage broker and partner with $RKT is they are undermining the broker because they are taking business away from the broker by going direct to consumer on the Rocket Mortgage app. While on the surface this looks like a valent effort to protect the hard earned market of mortgage brokers it is ill advised and actually hurting brokers financially. UWMC fantasizing that this would change consumer behavior but it will not. Consumers who want to get their mortgage direct through an app are not the same consumers that are likely to get their mortgage through a broker. To relate this to a different industry lets use accounting (since I'm in this space). There are certain people who will want to file their own taxes and not deal with an accountant for reasons like: it's cheaper, they don't want people knowing their business, ect. Then their are consumers who will only use an accountant for reasons like: they like relying on a professional or they do not have time to their taxes themselves. You can think of Intuit turbo tax as the company in this example. For whatever the reason may be consumers have varying reasons for their behavior and I argue in the case of getting a mortgage or refinance it's almost two different groups of consumers. One that prefers a broker and the other that prefers to do it themselves through an app. This being said this only hurts mortgage brokers in the end because they cannot process any leads through $RKT hurting the people Mat Ishbia is claiming to protect. Lastly $RKT can win the battle on the mortgage broker end, they have the ability to drop their fees charged through a broker to entice more brokers to exclusively work with them. If UWMC continues to play this game in the race to the bottom RKT will beat them at their own game and eventually lead to UWMC removing the $5k penalty. $RKT already lowered their rates to crush them and they are still guiding in their Q1 estimates a higher gain on margin than $UWMC

[Interview where the $5,000 penalty ultimatum is said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/uwm-ceo-says-fight-with-quicken-loans-is-paying-off.html)

2) Getting back to the statement that the CEO believes $RKT revenue is going to decrease and UWMC is going to increase for them to be the top mortgage lender by 2024 is more ill advised fantasy guidance (link to interview below). Personally I think AMC has a better chance of hitting $10,000 before $UWMC is beating $RKT.  The likelihood of UWMC doubling revenue and RKT revenue decreasing by 50% is very very unlikely as alluded too in the clip. The $UWMC CEO also fails to recognize $RKT has already won the industry and they are moving on to take over other sectors that are growing at triple % rates

* Rocket Homes is going to take on Zillow eventually with a one stop shop of buying a home with your pre approved mortgage all built into one app
* Rocket Autos is going to launch in an app and they are going to be competing against Carvana with the advantage of having your financing all built within the app so you have a one stop shop for searching for the car and setting up your monthly payment
* Amrock title insurance services, property valuation and settlement service is growing at the highest level of closing history per their Q1 release
* See the news article below. $RKT also hedges against the price of rates rising from their purchase of government backed mortgages and is now selling them for a profit [Mortgage companies are making money off your forbearance plan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-companies-are-making-money-off-your-forbearance-plan-11623835802)
* $RTK is still sitting on a share buy back program that they have yet to start where as UWMC has momentum and a buy back program occurring right now and it has still yet to pop off. 

With all of these new and fast growing revenue streams, and one industry already dominated, $RKT is the way, short and long term. Not to mention they have a massive advertising campaign and they're trying to crush $UWMC out of their own price war so $RKT could be extremely profitable if they wanted to be, but they don't right now. Right now they want to dominate all these sectors first, like Amazon did early on, and then turn on the profit tendie machine at a later date and watch the earnings roll in.

[Interview where UWMC saying it will be top mortgage lender by 2024 b/c $RKT revenue will decrease](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/06/11/united-wholesale-mortgage-ceo-on-goal-to-be-top-mortgage-lender-by-2024.html)

I want to conclude with the fact that I love this sub and the ability of this group of apes on line at Wendy's to fundamentally change the way the boomers view stonks. I watch CNBC constantly and it's amazing how they just dismiss WSB as a bunch of retards. While this may be true, the truth is no-one knows wtf they are doing in the market, not even these hedge funds. The truth is you all do some great DD on different stocks with very intelligent points. I'm happy to be in a place where we can write about our deep understanding of technical and fundamental analysis while also getting shit on in the comments like it's an MW2 chat lobby"
2021-06-16 20:23:01,wallstreetbets,"I own both, I hope there’s a run up before interest rates rise"
2021-06-16 22:14:31,wallstreetbets,I own RKT mostly but to be safe I also bought UWMC
2021-06-16 21:40:50,wallstreetbets,So your saying buy more UWMC
2021-06-16 23:35:58,wallstreetbets,This confirms my decision to purchase more UWMC shares earlier today.
2021-06-16 22:51:56,wallstreetbets,UWMC! TAKE US TO THE MOON MATT DaDDY!
2021-06-16 21:07:45,wallstreetbets,More UWMC it is!
2021-06-16 23:08:40,wallstreetbets,"Man that was lots of words, so buy uwmc, got it"
2021-06-16 22:16:53,wallstreetbets,"One of the mortgage brokers I know was all RKT, now he's all UWMC."
2021-06-16 22:45:07,wallstreetbets,"UWMC puts lots of companies worth of brokers to work.  Rocket is just themself.  UWMC is the better company model. Rocket marketed well and did well with refis, but UWMC is better for mortgages, which with rising interest rates is the bigger future. UWMC therefore is better.  And with the low float it is a much better buy."
2021-06-16 23:17:22,wallstreetbets,UWMC me driving a Mercedes realllll soon.
2021-06-17 08:03:43,wallstreetbets,Thank you for this! Going to buy more UWMC at open now
2021-06-16 22:10:11,wallstreetbets,"Got it, buying more UWMC!"
2021-06-16 22:23:03,wallstreetbets,UWMC is fantastic. Love the competitiveness. Bought 250 more shares today
2021-06-16 23:00:21,wallstreetbets,"I’ve bought more than 73,000 shares of UWMC now…"

2021-06-17 11:15:06,wallstreetbets,"UWMC will go to $15 easily if it breaks $10
HF are doing their best to keep price below $10"
2021-06-16 20:13:56,wallstreetbets,UWMC for the win. Good luck with RKT. Just not the rocket I am taking to the moon.
2021-06-16 22:46:35,wallstreetbets,Uwmc got my money. Rocket is old news
2021-06-16 20:28:00,wallstreetbets,"Cool good DD, bought more UWMC today thanks."
2021-06-17 07:34:37,wallstreetbets,UWMC confirmed to be the better bargain...
2021-06-16 22:11:21,wallstreetbets,"Message to brokers.

RKT - hey I know you are our business partner, but we are trying to cut the ‘middle man’ out so we can make more money.  Please don’t take it personally.

UWMC - hey I know you are our business partner & we would never cut the ‘middle man’ out so we can make more money.  Please sign this to work exclusively with us."
2021-06-16 20:29:45,wallstreetbets,Definitely buying more UWMC then.
2021-06-16 20:03:43,wallstreetbets,Got it. Buy more UWMC.
2021-06-16 21:18:33,wallstreetbets,UWMC baby sorry
2021-06-17 00:17:11,wallstreetbets,Always UWMC cuz that’s the real MC
2021-06-16 21:58:11,wallstreetbets,Sold all my RKT for more UWMC.
2021-06-17 01:21:02,wallstreetbets,So buy more uwmc?  That's the play
2021-06-16 21:24:08,wallstreetbets,If i buy both then it cant go tits up???
2021-06-17 10:39:08,wallstreetbets,"You've convinced me to buy more UWMC, thanks!"
2021-06-16 20:08:37,wallstreetbets,That’s the most retarded thing I’ve ever heard. Buying more UWMC
2021-06-17 07:52:24,wallstreetbets,I’ll buy more uwmc then
2021-06-17 00:25:10,wallstreetbets,Buying more Uwmc good dd
2021-06-17 02:03:44,wallstreetbets,So we buy UWMC?
2021-06-16 20:21:25,wallstreetbets,Based on your analysis I take it to believe we should buy a shit ton of UWMC as they are beating RKT long term because the ceo has balls of Steele!!! Got it
2021-06-17 02:34:06,wallstreetbets,">Mat's argument is if you are a mortgage broker and partner with $RKT is they are undermining the broker because they are taking business away from the broker by going direct to consumer on the Rocket Mortgage app.

Broker channel actually does make a difference.  A broker can quote a Rocket mortgage to a borrower with rates significantly lower than that same borrower can achieve by going to Rocket directly. The difference was around 0.50% on the interest rate last I checked. 

Rocket has protocol in place to prevent their employees from taking over borrowers' applications from brokers.  But if the borrower ever rate shopped on Rocket app, the borrower cannot qualify for the broker rates since Rocket already claimed the borrower as a direct consumer.  Blocking borrowers from getting broker rates is to Rocket's advantage (higher rates charged).

As brokers make the choice between UWM or Rocket, brokers also consider channel support from their wholesale lender support team.  A broker might be able to get a slight bit lower rate for a particular client with Rocket than UWM, but the broker is also going to consider ease of loan approval and likelihood of closing on time and other factors that are important to the borrower if the rate difference between UWM or Rocket means a difference of maybe $10/month on payments.   
Overall broker experience between UWM and Rocket is going to vary broker to broker depending on their support team with either lender so I not making a blanket statement about either lender's ability to create a smooth process for borrowers. 

The broker agreement or addendum basically prevents brokers from accessing UWM's programs if the broker continues to give business to Rocket. The result will either be that Rocket loses business from brokers or that Rocket changes its programs to improve the broker experience. 

I'm not implying any implications for the future of $UWMC or $RKT as a result."
2021-06-17 06:33:51,wallstreetbets,Uwmc is the way All In
2021-06-16 21:40:37,wallstreetbets,"I don’t care about who wins, because regardless of if they’re number one of number two in the sector, they’re still an undervalued stock given their financials"

2021-06-17 06:15:41,wallstreetbets,Coke bro Mat go go go!
2021-06-17 10:34:13,wallstreetbets,I need a broker in Texas and Arkansas. And Idaho. Anyone got any leads?
2021-06-17 08:35:47,wallstreetbets,"RKT is going to lose a lot of business as indicated by their projections for Q2. They are decreasing it by more than 20%, while UWM seems to still be pretty
consistent. Clearly the refi market is going to continue dwindling down hurting RKT, so I’m not sure exactly how it is a good play right now??"
2021-06-17 08:53:33,wallstreetbets,$RKT is a joke.

Lols you guys are so silly."
2021-06-16 20:58:29,wallstreetbets,Rocket mortgage is an absolute complete and total joke.  They will fuck around and fuck around and fuck around.  They are so completely disorganized and inefficient it completely blows me away that they are even in business.  It's not going to take long for people to realize that rocket mortgage is not the place to go if you want to close a mortgage or refinance.
2021-06-16 20:09:10,wallstreetbets,Where is Mat getting that 94% of rkt revenue is refi?
2021-06-17 00:38:44,wallstreetbets,"Bro the fact I have all my money in both of these stocks, and you said what you did, I'm pretty sure it's going to the moon"

2021-06-17 17:37:16,wallstreetbets,I couldn't agree with you more. UWMC CEO is a bully and I'm glad broker's told him to go fuck himself with his bullshit ultimatum
2021-06-16 23:29:31,wallstreetbets,"Spot on. You could have a totally arbitrary number of middlemen, necessary or not, and they'd still bitch if a single one of them was threatened. If for whatever nonsensical reason the mortgage industry had broker #1, selling to broker #2, selling to broker #3, selling to broker #4, selling to consumer, and someone tried to cut out broker #4, they would still throw a shitfit about the lost jobs. Doesn't matter whether it improves efficiency, any industry that is threatened, no matter how outdated, will always go out kicking and screaming.

You already saw this happen to small farmers. You saw it happen to some brick and mortar retailers, and you'll see the trend continuing. You will see this happen to factory workers being replaced by robots. And you'll see it happen to the mortgage industry. In every case, overall economic wellbeing is improved after the restructuring takes place (though governments can do a lot to help improve the efficiency of the transition... Or not, as usual). That's just creative destruction at work.

People might look back a year from now and if rocket isn't ""winning"" they'll use it to claim rocket is a losing strategy (in an effort to get people to dump the stock so they can buy cheap). Because in 5, 10, 20 years, RKT and anyone else smart enough to get in on the action will be at the top, period, and they know it. Middlemen who fail to adapt will keep doing what they do best - crying about it"
2021-06-16 22:23:05,wallstreetbets,"This is a really good DD. Some insight I never thought about. Who needs the so-called ""pro"" to tell us what's right.  I think we retard apes are smarter than the ""pro"".

That's said.  I would consider loading up $RKT instead of $UWMC. Glad I read this DD as I was considering loading up $UWMC. But again, I will need to do more research before deciding what to do. One thing that is striking to me was Mat say $RKT does 94% refi. I don't think that's true."
2021-06-16 23:03:27,wallstreetbets,This got me going.  I've got shares and sold puts
2021-06-16 20:24:41,wallstreetbets,"Rkt is finished. Housing market and refinance in particular will cool significantly. Uwmc and rkt are cyclical, their revenues are going to decrease for years to come."

2021-06-17 12:09:10,wallstreetbets,"Well I'm not gonna be one of the UWMC tards that drank the kool-aid. Wholesale mortgaging is inefficient, and RKT is all about removing inefficiencies. Rocket has Rocket Pro TPO, which allows you to do wholesaling yourself, but I really see the direct to consumer approach winning heavily if they can make it truly ""push button get loan"" and having RKT be the only middleman. That way they don't have to pay loan officers, don't have to deal with the wholesalers needing to do dumb things like eat and live. They can cut all the costs that nobody else wants to put the effort into cutting.

UWMC is trying to fight against automation with more people. I think everyone knows how that fight usually goes."
2021-06-17 07:43:19,wallstreetbets,"I'm invested in RKT, but I found this title amusing because Dan Gilbert recently started building what was going to be the new tallest building in Detroit, but last year the project got scaled back so it no longer will be.

2021-06-16 23:13:56,wallstreetbets,The culture of Rocket is way less cultish than UWMC. Listen to each of their earnings and staff conference calls and you’ll notice it immediately. I held UWMC when it was a SPAC but dumped it for RKT after listening to them for myself.

2021-06-16 23:28:23,wallstreetbets,"Amazing how short sighted some people are, then again the boomers left a fuck up world for us to figures it all out."
2021-06-16 21:58:42,wallstreetbets,you dirty whore
2021-06-16 23:17:05,wallstreetbets,Literally can’t.
2021-06-16 21:30:12,wallstreetbets,Better not tell you now
2021-06-16 21:25:35,wallstreetbets,idk what this means but i'm about it
2021-06-17 07:01:00,wallstreetbets,And they pay a 5% dividend
2021-06-17 09:18:32,wallstreetbets,Please elaborate on how they are “bEaTiNg Rkt LoNg TeRm!”
2021-06-16 21:15:06,wallstreetbets,"which is why they have an over 90% retention rate, because they are so terrible."
2021-06-16 21:29:00,wallstreetbets,that's what i'm saying
2021-06-17 02:10:46,wallstreetbets,"Why would you want to diversify when you can just do one thing, right!"
2021-06-16 23:01:49,wallstreetbets,biggest issue with rkt is its valuation. its already at 40-45b while uwmc is at 15b. Both earn similar amounts of money and both have a ton of cash. I'm obviously going to buy the one that's under valued relative to its peers. I see both correcting to around the 25-30b market cap.
2021-06-16 23:22:03,wallstreetbets,"I think they have like 5b cash on hand, iirc from last earnings."
2021-06-16 23:48:59,wallstreetbets,I love the company but actually HATE the stock.  Good thing I'm in because of the company!
2021-06-16 20:17:02,wallstreetbets,Even if they do the market is so hot right now that the only thing I can think of that would make that a terrible short term situation is if the stock price is currently reflecting a hot housing market for the foreseeable future and past any future announced rate hike.
2021-06-16 23:04:24,wallstreetbets,Options chain is humongous. It’s cheaper to pin the price on naked shorts this week then it was to hedge the chain.
2021-06-16 22:02:43,wallstreetbets,plus the share buyback. It’s overvalued that’s why. People are trying to pump and dumb UWMC. RKT is undervalued on fundamentals
2021-06-16 23:38:03,wallstreetbets,Thank you and yes I agree 100% it’s the story of our modern economy
2021-06-16 23:55:40,wallstreetbets,How dare you say you might buy RKT.  I'm downvoting you because I don't like RKT.
2021-06-16 21:14:17,wallstreetbets,which is why RKT is the better bet.  They've got more than just home loans.
2021-06-16 21:50:12,wallstreetbets,hell yea there we go 🙌🏼💎🚀
2021-06-17 00:03:24,wallstreetbets,It’s 10 dollars cheaper so peeps think it has “more to run “
2021-06-17 02:12:42,wallstreetbets,"Yep, Mat knows his only shot is to get people onboard now.  Dan and Jay are playing the long term game and aren't concerned about tomorrow as much as they are about 3yrs from now.  Got them billions for making improvements and upgrades."
2021-06-17 18:15:46,wallstreetbets,I've got 800 at 24 and don't regret a thing.
2021-06-17 12:12:00,wallstreetbets,hell yea
2021-06-17 06:08:02,wallstreetbets,Aww it’s the retard with the $85 price predictions 😂
2021-06-17 12:12:51,wallstreetbets,"No ones got time to read all that , we’re to busy looking at the ticker all day"
2021-06-17 12:24:06,wallstreetbets,Yes and there are a lot of 🌈 🐻 in WSB.
2021-06-17 06:48:47,wallstreetbets,"Lol, kinda wanna call BS. 

What version of rkts platform mobile or Pc, both look like it was put together by a jr JavaScript developer 

Im into real estate as well but I found there app extremely amateur , then again this was at the beginning of the year"
2021-06-16 22:54:55,wallstreetbets,There’s literally nothing UWMC can do that Rocket can’t.  On the other end…And there is a lot rocket can do you UWMC cannot. Actually UWMC just dick eats off everything rkt does like a pesty little brother...like announce a buyback/dividend (which can be broke back anytime). End of discussion. And this will get downvoted because all the poor bitches here can only afford a $10 stock
2021-06-17 01:40:51,wallstreetbets,Here I thought I was doing good with my almost 1700
2021-06-17 05:10:07,wallstreetbets,Sitting on a solid 18. No big deal.
2021-06-16 21:59:32,wallstreetbets,Only when your sister is in town
2021-06-16 22:05:52,wallstreetbets,Absolutely the worst company to deal with when it comes to a refi.  My story is not isolated.  Dig deep my man.  You'll find the real truth.
2021-06-16 23:02:49,wallstreetbets,Have you read their 10Q? I bet the answer is there somewhere.
2021-06-16 23:05:11,wallstreetbets,They don’t even make remotely close to the same amount of money you’re out of your mind or are you just havent to compared financials. They own like 30 companies including Amrock which probably does most of your remote closings.
2021-06-16 23:09:23,wallstreetbets,But UWMC is earning like 10-20% of what RKT is earning and has a much lower customer retention rate. I highly doubt their caps will ever equalize. RKT is the leading provider and they’re positioning to capture an even greater market share plus they’re expanding into RKT homes and RKT auto as well pivoting into the Canadian market. I mean I’ve had positions in UWMC on and off but good lord is it glorified here into something they’re absolutely not. They’re a good company and are undervalued but RKT is extremely undervalued as well and is positioned to provide value for years to come
2021-06-17 12:34:21,wallstreetbets,"UWMC's revenue is 1/3 of RKT's. And their valuation is a little higher than 1/3 of RKT.

What are you on about? If anything, the balance is in RKT's favor to go up, or UWM to go down."
2021-06-16 23:55:39,wallstreetbets,"Lol yep, the low float, high institutional holdings and low volume have been stifling."
2021-06-16 21:13:00,wallstreetbets,"And I don't believe the stock price is reflecting the hot housing market, otherwise both companies stocks would be double what they are now."
2021-06-16 23:05:06,wallstreetbets,"They’re both undervalued IMO, I just think UWMC has the higher potential to 5x my cash in under 5 years. We’lll see!"
2021-06-17 19:30:18,wallstreetbets,Maybe you should learn how to comprehend a post. I never said that. I said I sold $22 covered calls against my shares.
2021-06-17 09:13:12,wallstreetbets,I refinanced with RKT and I love their app.  It made refinancing super easy.  I am also a share holder.
2021-06-17 08:12:04,wallstreetbets,"Well my experience is anecdotal and only from listening to different users. I have no experience using the platforms but from what I’ve seen they both look like nothing to write home about. 
I hold both and know both will make me profit. so not gunna make a profile to shit on one anytime soon and you don’t do UWMC any favours doing that"
2021-06-16 22:57:08,wallstreetbets,"UWMC can close a loan in 14 days and save a consumer $3,800 by using a broker. End of game."
2021-06-16 23:13:04,wallstreetbets,"Whereas RKT invests heavily into advertising, UWMC invests in superior technology.  It's pretty clear RKT is all flash and has built a house of glass.  You must be a salty $40 RKT bag holder.  

Also a $10 share price is completely irrelevant, it all starts with the market cap when it comes to a stocks valuation. Based on UWMC's they have insane capital growth potential."
2021-06-16 23:11:34,wallstreetbets,A lot of people used to work there so I think your way in over your head. You were probably an annoying ass borrower calling in asking “what’s your rate“? although they probably took great care of you and your credit score was probably shit because of your all your money on FDs so they declined you and now you take your anger out on a Reddit page
2021-06-16 22:38:19,wallstreetbets,"Hahah. I made two purchases and did 3 refis with Rocket, it was incredibly efficient and FAST every single time. I had to talk to a banker like once, and an agent THAT THEY SENT TO MY LOCATION. I had to do literally nothing. It was so fucking easy. But, yeah. Keep living in your subprime bubble. Don't blame Rocket because you have poor credit or whatever the fuck."
2021-06-16 23:43:03,wallstreetbets,My parents just did a refi with them and said the process was easy.  They had zero problems.  With a retention rate of over 90% there is no way they offer bad service.  I'm not saying there aren't instances where things get screwed up because that happens when people are involved.  The numbers just show that the majority of people don't have a problem with them.
2021-06-16 23:24:36,wallstreetbets,"I'm looking at the net income attributable to RKT companies (which if i recall correctly was just a few hundred million) which is not as glossy as their basic net income figure of 2.7 billion.   


Anyways I'm not rooting against RKT, I'm just making an investment decision based on valuation. I do believe that if RKT is doing well, then UWMC will do well too as theyre both part of the same industry.  I just like where UWMC is at right now currently from a valuation perspective relative to others in the industry.   


That being said UWMC has already climbed from 6.50 4 weeks ago to 9.80ish now so its already made big strides towards the appropriate valuation for it IMO. I still see 15-20% upside in the midterm."
2021-06-17 00:01:13,wallstreetbets,"I believe over time those things will change.  RKT will use its' shares to make other moves which will add to the float.  Kind of like Gilbert did at the end of may where he moved some of his share type over to add to the float.  May take time, hopefully I have the patience to wait for it."
2021-06-17 11:14:17,wallstreetbets,"I could really care less about my personal contribution to pumping uwmc, I’m not here for that nor do I think me criticizing rocket affects it’s stock price at all. 

I’m saying as an application developer who visited RKT’s website both mobile and app, it looks like something a sr. College student would put together for their final project. I like UWMC because it has great fundamentals and I don’t have to worry about looking at the stock everyday. 

Rkt on the other hand is still very speculative but I will never argue with anyone that invests in tech, it is the future. Im saying they need to make their services more professional looking with better features such as comparisons, live support, etc"
2021-06-16 23:01:30,wallstreetbets,Laughing my ass off as far as speed goes you got nothing on rocket and you just don’t have the same amount of volume so it’s easier to close loans faster
2021-06-16 23:19:23,wallstreetbets,No I’ve been here since IPO made 100K in March on the squeeze with FDs and added to my position at 16.8. I think there’s some pics on my profile for facts because I know you were gonna call me a liar. In any case I’ll just send you a pic of my gains when the numbers do the talk in 2022. Also as far as you’re holding the bag comment goes….At least there was a chance for a bag holders to get in at those levels while you still wait for a pipe dream.
2021-06-17 00:28:43,wallstreetbets,"Actually quite the contrary I have a credit score over 800 I have plenty of income lots of money in the bank and I'm not an annoying ass.  And just for the record I wasn't declined.  I took my business elsewhere.
And... I'm not angry..."
2021-06-16 23:46:24,wallstreetbets,I love how you are getting downvoted because you're talking about having a positive experience with Rocket.  The hatred towards RKT by the UWMC crowd just confirms that I'm in the right stonk.  I was going to buy both but decided against it to buy more RKT.
2021-06-17 00:01:42,wallstreetbets,Lol I had a similar it was super easy and fast 2 weeks boom done
2021-06-17 00:54:06,wallstreetbets,"So happy for you.  I think your getting WAY TOO EMOTIONAL here princess.  Relax I wasn't saying you are shit.  Have a coke and a smile, take a breath and just chill sweet cheeks. I mean unless you work there.  If so.... Sorry.  Hopefully you are more professional in your work place then your last comment directed to me."
2021-06-17 00:22:13,wallstreetbets,"Shit service, shit communication, passed around like a $5 hooker that's charging $100.  THEN when called out on it they lower their price (to standard rates) and treat you like a pile of used condoms all the while not giving you the money shot.  Shit company.  Have fun with em.  Don't say you haven't been warned."
2021-06-17 00:17:55,wallstreetbets,Wait till you deal with them yourself.  Then let's talk.
2021-06-16 23:29:12,wallstreetbets,Rather writing a whole DD here’s one completely wrecking your statement. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx7vfo/why_rkt_is_my_1_investment_and_it_should_be_yours/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
2021-06-17 00:04:57,wallstreetbets,"Well at least we’ll have our dividend :)

I’ll wait for the gains, the first quarter earnings dump was utter bs, they revised targets 7x and the last revision was like day before earnings and they still only missed by 1 cent. Second quarter expectations are more muted and that works in our favor. We all know this lull is just institutions accumulating before allowing it to run again."
2021-06-16 23:04:36,wallstreetbets,"On rocket’s own website they say it takes them on average 30-45 days to close. UWMC does it in half that. https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/closing-on-a-house
Not only does using a broker save the consumer money but they close in half the time."
2021-06-16 23:09:47,wallstreetbets,"Okay, then show us RKT’s true time to close stats. Waiting…"
2021-06-16 23:29:00,wallstreetbets,"I don't actually care if you've made money or not, it's just fun to throw out the $40 bag holder comment at RKT simps. The only reason you're getting downvoted to hell, as you expected, is because you're a biased ass hole in the original comment. It's clear you haven't done DD on UWMC if you feel they copy RKT. Both companies CEOs are in a constant pissing match, you just feel UWMC copies RKT because it's literally the only stock you follow."
2021-06-17 01:30:46,wallstreetbets,Everyone has a credit score over 800 🙄
2021-06-17 07:36:35,wallstreetbets,They quoted me a rate that was about 1%-1.5% over what every single other lender quoted me. I don’t know how they can do business that way
2021-06-17 00:50:04,wallstreetbets,Well.  I'm not down voting anyone.  And I'm glad you guys had good experiences.  It wasn't mine.  I have been through 2 home purchases and 3 refis in 20 years.  All I was saying is MY experience was shit with a company i feel is shit.  No I'm not a pain on the ass customer.  It's totally OK for you guys to have a difference of opinion here.  Its ALSO OK for me to voice mine here.  Also.. I'm not in EITHER of these 2 stocks.  I would only buy rocket to day trade it if the entry and volume was there.  It would NEVER be a long hold for me.  They are going to get crucified in this bubble.
2021-06-16 23:48:02,wallstreetbets,"Yup. Exactly. Children will be children and make mistakes. They must learn on their own.

It honestly doesn't even matter. WSB doesn't collectively give a single shit about UWMC (or RKT), yet the UWMC shills keep thinking they will come to the rescue. Please, keep waiting. Lol"
2021-06-17 01:06:42,wallstreetbets,Lol. This chick..
2021-06-17 12:27:33,wallstreetbets,"I did my mortgage through them. A year later I did a refi through them. Signing up for the refi was practically 15 minutes of work, and they sent someone to my house to sign the paperwork in my kitchen. Didn't even take my whole lunch break, just like 20 minutes. It took longer to ask for a rate from one competing lender than it took to do the whole refi process.

Shopping around for better rates was terrible, because it was just a long process of having to talk to people on the phone and have them give me shit rates. Nobody would even match rocket, not even the ones with a price match guarantee."
2021-06-16 23:29:56,wallstreetbets,I have a finance and accounting background so I do my own DD.
2021-06-17 00:25:35,wallstreetbets,I really hope it's institutions buying up the shares.  I often remind myself that some institution paid $25 per share not too long ago.  If they didn't view the company has potentially being worth that they wouldn't have bought it.
2021-06-17 00:52:49,wallstreetbets,You know it was a one time dividend right? not ongoing.
2021-06-16 23:07:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s because they like to exceed expectations but set them higher
2021-06-16 23:14:26,wallstreetbets,I’m waiting for you to show me yours.
2021-06-16 23:31:02,wallstreetbets,I have done DD on both. The thing is you call me a Simp and you’re investing in a company rates are inevitably going to rise which has no different revenue stream other than mortgages and does not have the market capitalization to pay their employees and lower market share to be competitive with a multibillion dollar company that has been doing it for 30 years. RKT is innovating So who really hasn’t done the DD. And yeah I’m an asshole because you mofos down vote every RKT DD/comment posted
2021-06-17 01:38:24,wallstreetbets,Hi.... I'm everyone.  Hope you make a boatload of scrilla on them.  Be careful the cliffhanger here is interest rates if your in the stock.  Choose your entry carefully and place your stops tight.  I am going buy puts on this one.  If the hike happens and they don't have a plan B in place.  I see this one going to all time lows well below the $16 mark.  I will be buying puts on this one if the interest rates go up.
2021-06-17 04:49:54,wallstreetbets,I'm not downplaying your bad experience I just believe there are 90 others who had a good one for every 10 bad ones.
2021-06-17 08:21:21,wallstreetbets,How long ago was this ‘bad’ experience? Rocket has been around for a long time. They definitely were a shit company even just a few years ago. They have totally transformed their corporate mindset. The customer experience is 100% different. This is why Rocket now is one of the best companies to work for in the US.
2021-06-17 12:34:49,wallstreetbets,"Obviously my situation is a little bit different.  Once I finally fired them after they dicked around for two and a half months.  I was financed and finished with another company in 25 days... saved myself a quarter point and $4,000."
2021-06-16 23:39:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah didn’t have the time to break down to you and this one was more fitting to your stance. I have many DDs on RkT.
2021-06-17 07:03:24,wallstreetbets,It can recur. Sure it’s not announced but they can announce again at any time..
2021-06-16 23:19:36,wallstreetbets,Just ask your mom. She’s seen it enough to describe it’s magnificence. She calls it Thor’s hammer.
2021-06-16 23:39:27,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is a multi-billion dollar company that has been doing it for 30 years also 😂😂😂 not to mention,  UWMC's balance sheet looks alot more clean that RKTs. RKT is going to drown in debt as interest rates rise."
2021-06-17 02:15:35,wallstreetbets,"RKT isn’t as sensitive to interest rates, that’s  UWMC.  Millions of home owners should refinance, and that’s even if rates were to double… RKT has other company growing double digit yoy, UWMC is the one trick pony"
2021-06-17 09:26:07,wallstreetbets,In my business and my line of work if I treated 10 out of 100 people like garbage and was unable to be professional and do my job... Guess what.. I would be out of a job. If you can't be better than 90% ( And just to be clear somebody said retention not satisfaction)  I think you need to reevaluate what is important in your business.  Just saying.  Now get to trading :)
2021-06-17 09:01:28,wallstreetbets, months ago.
2021-06-17 00:45:59,wallstreetbets,I read through the DD. Pretty compelling but it’s hard for me to pay a premium for a company on the mortgage industry. I hope we both make money!
2021-06-16 23:21:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah I expected the mom comments to come because you got nothing else to say. Let’s see where were standing in a year I just took a screenshot of this conversation I’ll post it right to your profile come 2022. At that point you’ll probably delete your Reddit account out of desperation and depression for losing all your money. How did those yolo weeklies come along for the squeeze this week?
2021-06-17 00:22:41,wallstreetbets,Drowning in debt?? They have 2 billion in liquid cash made in Q1 alone plus unaccessed lines of credit. I think you barely made a net profit if I’m not mistaken
2021-06-16 23:22:17,wallstreetbets,Waiting…
2021-06-17 02:25:51,wallstreetbets,Don't bother dude I don't own either but rkt is a far superior company in terms of everything.
2021-06-16 23:23:23,wallstreetbets,You’ll be waiting for a long time because your capped at $20. Seriously how the fuck do you think you’re gonna make money with rates going up in the future? Do you have any other revenue streams are you solely relying on taking marketshare from the largest lender in a nation has shown to dominate your company in as soon as they wanted to.You really are meant for this sub
2021-06-16 23:27:17,wallstreetbets,Waiting… come on it’s a simple request. What’s RKT’s time to close?

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cano - An undervalued stock and a way to profit off boomers.  **Section 1: What is Cano Health?**

Cano Health is a Florida centered value based care provider serving 103,000 people in America across 12 markets. That number is projected to grow to 300,000 by 2023. Cano Health is a primary care provider compensated through a fixed per member monthly fee from insurance companies. Because of this, Cano Health (and comparable companies) assume all risk and reap all benefits from costs of treatment. This structure incentivizes preventative care to stop health issues before they happen, which means lower costs for patients and Cano Health. This can be seen in action through Cano’s lower than average mortality rates, hospital admissions and ER visits. Cano Health recently went through a reverse merger with Jaws Acquisition Corp, and now trades publicly as $Cano. Cano Health presents us with an investment opportunity that has more than 100% upside, all the while allowing us to invest in a high growth and high TAM company with great institutional backing. 

[Cano has seen massive growth over the past 3-4 years, and will continue to do so.](https://preview.redd.it/12nbkmoosp571.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=687218b838465602af10c8d0ebb8e34c54dfde13)

[Medicare Advantage has seen good YoY growth, taking market share from Original Medicare.](https://preview.redd.it/ylynderpsp571.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=942e873c81e68da047a82c9dcc27c0f5f17526aa)

**Section 2: How do Medicare and Medicare advantage work for senior citizens?**

Medicare is a government run taxpayer funded health insurance program for primarily senior citizens over the age of 65 (barring some exceptions). Medicare allows senior citizens to go to any care provider who accepts it and receive treatment/care. Medicare is broken up into 4 key parts, which are the following:

1. **Medicare Part A:** Medicare Part A covers **Inpatient Care in Hospitals, Skilled Nursing Facility Care, Hospice Care and Home Health Care.** This is generally at a low cost to most seniors, provided they have paid Medicare taxes for a long enough period. They still may have some coinsurance payments and deductibles however.
2. **Medicare Part B:** Medicare Part B covers **Services from doctors and other health care providers, Outpatient care, Home health care, Durable medical equipment (DME) (like wheelchairs, walkers, hospital beds, and other equipment), and Many preventive services (like screenings, shots or vaccines, and yearly “Wellness” visits).** Patients using Medicare Part B generally have to pay a monthly fee (similar to normal health insurance), and in doing so, any care received by the patient is covered and paid for by Medicare. 
3. **Medicare Part C:** Medicare Part C is also known as Medicare advantage. This is essentially an all in one package that serves as an alternative to Original Medicare (Parts A and B). Medicare Part C is fulfilled through private companies which are vetted and approved by Medicare. These packages generally include the benefits offered in Medicare Parts A, B and D, but may also include other services such as **vision, hearing and dental.** 
4. **Medicare Part D:** Medicare Part D is an optional Medicare program run by private companies who are regulated by Medicare. It’s primary purpose is to **Help Cover Costs of Prescription Drugs and Protect Patients Against Future Increases in Drug Prices.**

Currently, there are 24.1 million seniors on Medicare Advantage plans, representing \~30% of all Medicare patients. This creates a massive TAM of tens of millions of new customers, representing billions of dollars.

**Section 3: How does a value based care model differ from a fee for service (FFS) model?**

Traditionally, Medicare has run on a fee for service model. This model operates like such: A patient comes into a Medicare accepting facility for a routine health checkup. 10 tests are run on the patient whilst they are there. In the fee for service model, Medicare is billed for all 10 of these tests individually. This model creates incentive for more individual services (Volume) to be done on patients, rather than high quality and important care. Under fee-for-service models, cost variations for procedures and tests increased and the healthcare industry was spending more to treat patients even though patient outcomes were not necessarily improving. The model also challenged provider workflows because physicians were seeing more patients and each claim had to be processed in a fragmented network. On the flipside, Value based care models create a much better environment for everyone. Value based care models are based on patient outcomes, not quantity of services provided to patients. Unlike the traditional fee for service model, value-based care is driven by data because providers must report to payers on specific metrics and demonstrate improvement. Providers may have to track and report on hospital readmissions, adverse events, population health, patient engagement, and more.

[Cano Health has successfully lowered Mortality Rates, Hospital Admissions and ER Visits despite Covid-19 and all the challenges brought with it which proves the model's success.](https://preview.redd.it/1ox6pubbtp571.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=296b4cee7602393006b7449f521baefb880a925f)

**4. What makes Cano a good investment?**

Cano Health has many compelling arguments as to why it is criminally undervalued, and they are the following:

1. **40% organic annual membership growth with additional growth from acquisitions.**
2. **Has strong tailwinds in an industry with increasing pressure for cost reductions, and a shift towards value based care from fee for service care.**
3. **Cano currently serves 113k members in 15 different markets. With this, they only have 6% penetration in existing markets. The overall TAM is enormous at 24.1M Medicare Advantage enrollees in 2020 with that set to grow in the future years. This leaves Cano with plenty of runway to grow organically and through acquisitions**
4. **Extremely favorable comps to OSH which put a fair value for this at \~30 dollars based on revenue multiples.**
5. **86% revenue CAGR**
6. **Raised ebitda, revenue and membership guidance from management.**
7. **Recent acquisition of University Health Care, increasing their market share and exposure in Florida, a place which is among states with the highest enrollments in Medicare Advantage in the country.**
8. **Reputable Analyst Nephron Research initiated a price target of $22 dollars, with more to follow from other institutions in the near future.**
9. **Great institutional PIPE holdings from the likes of Fidelity, Blackrock and Third Point, who in addition purchased shares from the open market to add to their holdings.**

[Cano holds many advantages over it's 1:1 competitor OSH.](https://preview.redd.it/5sou84n1up571.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba8f1ff62e56f62d70487b558e7c0f63a7b55122)

Cano Health has a significant connection and exposure to the hispanic population in not only Florida, but other states as well. 85% of their employees are bilingual and 80% of Cano’s members are minorities. Most of the largest states for Medicare have substantial minority, Spanish speaking populations, which gives Cano lots of room for expansion, and a moat over other companies such as OSH. 

**How Do The Charts Look?**

&#x200B;

[For many months, Cano has been in an upward channel which seems like it will continue.](https://preview.redd.it/yn0f0d68up571.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&s=41305e9dc038178298bc6813fdd82bc2d699e6a5)

**Positions or Ban?** 

&#x200B;

[ I am currently long 100 October 15 12.5 calls, however any calls from July onward are fine, though there is inherent risk to buying shorter dated ones. Shares are also a good buy. ](https://preview.redd.it/p3terg8eup571.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=65ffed244ab30c7633d65bf717d0d48e6fe53b4a)

**Tldr:** Cano Health is a criminally undervalued Medicare Advantage company with favorable valuations and metrics vs direct competitors such as $OSH. Cano has a massive TAM and good CAGR, and is a multibagger opportunity that should hit $30 in the near future.

What do you all think?"
2021-06-16 20:49:14,wallstreetbets,"Just because someone’s mRNA tech didn’t work isn’t really a reason to bash the others, but to each their own

Edit: it’s like saying because RIDE and NKLA suck we should sell TSLA"
2021-06-16 23:29:21,wallstreetbets,"INO has a solid pipeline.  It has been late to the game and needs to make up ground in the covid vax game for sure. However with variants and a still truly unknown long term outlook on this disease INO fits the bill for a potential long term play for Covid, with additional products in mid / late development stage

To dismiss INO completely seems silly just as saying it hits 500 in a month is silly"
2021-06-17 05:31:20,wallstreetbets,I see a positive future for Inovio. I'm in.
2021-06-16 20:51:15,wallstreetbets,"I think you  have even less of a  scientific background than I do. 

mRNA is a type or class of vaccine.  

Each manufacturer has their own proprietary method of making the synthetic mRNA.  

CureVac was trying something new -- mRNA vaccine that was able to be stored at room temperature. Clearly their method of producing the synthetic mRNA not not successful,  

The failure of this one company, CureVac,which just like Inovio has never brought a medication to market,  is not a failure of the scientific principals behind 

Inovio's vaccine trials have not yet started with their Chinese partner Advaccine.  Whether that trial would be accepted by the FDA or the foreign equivalent agencies is not known."
2021-06-16 20:01:36,wallstreetbets,"Right. Dumbing it down to common man would perhaps be to explain the jargons ij simple term. Anyway it's subjective. Btw, DNA vaccines which you called garbage are already in market for veterinary vaccinations. RNA vaccine on the contrary weren't even a viable option yet. 😉"
2021-06-16 21:30:30,wallstreetbets,I think you should get a PHD to find out.
2021-06-17 11:45:03,wallstreetbets,"BioNTech didn't either, but they were wise enough to partner with Pfizer from the get go.

If CureVac had done the same thing with Bayer, they might have been more succesful."
2021-06-17 08:15:39,wallstreetbets,The real Warthog would easily pump and dump this trash company
2021-06-16 21:52:44,wallstreetbets,"Moderna is not Big Pharma, not in the top 10 biggest Pharm companies.  It has existed for less time than Inovio but at least Moderna has brought a product to market.

Now I hope that INO has success with the GBM treatment research, but the BiG PHarMa bit gets too close to stonkanon territory."
2021-06-17 12:10:50,wallstreetbets,They sure were.  Curevac missed the boat
2021-06-16 20:41:58,wallstreetbets,Haha. Simply awesome.
2021-06-16 21:57:26,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough and most definitely agree with your GBM comment. We’ve all unfortunately been impacted by one way or another due to Cancer. Incredible that Inovio can help. I lost my mom to Pancreatic Cancer 20 years ago unfortunately, and to think one day there may be a cure. Good luck and all the best to all."
2021-06-17 12:06:20,wallstreetbets,"All these shots are still in clinical trial, I’m not into that conspiracy stuff I’m just saying. You might become a furry."
2021-06-16 22:24:40,wallstreetbets,Happy pride month to you
2021-06-17 03:49:20,wallstreetbets,I am more interested in the GBM research to be honest — that is potentially groundbreaking— much more ambivalent about vaccine investment angle.
2021-06-16 20:09:03,wallstreetbets,"Well the US government just ordered 200m more doses from them, on top of the original 500m and they're producing vaccine in many different countries... And the mRNA pipeline is full of potential for cancer, etc..."
2021-06-16 20:11:21,wallstreetbets,"All the best, we will see what works. Hope you make your grands. I am here for errands ;)"
2021-06-16 20:57:59,wallstreetbets,According to his post history he’s only here to drum up support for inovio so I’d highly doubt he’s a scientist.
2021-06-16 21:13:10,wallstreetbets,Calling anything I said scientific jargon further supports your doubts

2021-06-17 05:21:56,wallstreetbets,"Inflation has been underreported for a while. What you're seeing now is companies who ""benefited"" from asset inflation suddenly not benefiting from this inflation, so they've become vocal about it. Warren Buffett is a class example; he benefited from the previous asset bubble inflation, but now is not benefiting from this commodity inflation.  
  
I'm one of the few people who has been calculating his own inflation rate for over a decade and [inflation has averaged about 8% per](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5UZs5OEVqQ) year over that timeframe. Most people don't do this, but I challenge them to do so. Inflation has never been lower than 5% in any given year for me and many people may see similar numbers for their area."

2021-06-16 22:57:26,wallstreetbets,"I see it trading sideways and probably down a bit for a few months until it shoots a bit like BB did.

I rode the BB wave and sold at the top and am hoping to do the same with UWMC (300 shares at 9.50).  I’m small change but it’s all play money from my initial $250 on GME months ago.

I’ve seen all the DD on UWMC this year, rode the RKT pump and dump, and always seen UWMC as a safe bet when I wanted some stability for a while."
2021-06-17 10:45:49,wallstreetbets,"I don't know why they would be deleting uwmc post either a, assuming they are, but a few days there was a faked uwmc post. That may or may not have something to do with it. That's fake to post freaked me out, it was a fake screenshot, so I decided to dump might um see had about a 5% lost. I mean my uwmc. I might have panicked and sold too soon. Best of luck to you and yours!"

2021-06-16 22:58:30,wallstreetbets,You wanna buy house uwmc gives you money they are the second biggest next to rkt with better financials and cheaper in general from p/e to cash flow you name it
2021-06-17 00:03:13,wallstreetbets,"You have two options when you need a big loan for a house purchase: use a mortgage broker, or find a lender yourself. The mortgage broker works on your behalf to find the best loan/rate for you, and then helps you finish the closing process so you can get your cash. Usually the price and rate you get from a broker will come from a “wholesale” lender, like UWM. 

UWM works with mortgage brokers to 1) provide loans at the cheapest rates possible. They save you thousands of dollars on the close and interest in your loan and 2) make the broker’s job easier and more efficient."

2021-06-16 21:50:33,wallstreetbets,Me too!
2021-06-16 23:52:26,wallstreetbets,"don't think option contracts themselves have any effect on volume (options volume just refers to the amount of contracts traded during the day which doesn't effect price)

buying ITM calls means the sellers of those contracts will need to buy the shares necessary to deliver them to buyers on exercise/expiry (all calls/puts that expire ITM are automatically exercised). Loading up on OTM calls just means option dealers will need to hedge a larger amount of shares as the price goes above those strikes.

shares are what directly influences the price, without people buying and holding shares, options dealers are making easy money"

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Mike McKee rocked CNBC and Jay Powell to reveal whats really going on. Seriously the best five minutes of CNBC was when Mike McKee (bloomberg) so eloquently asked the right questions during today's FOMC meeting. 

Mike Mckee asked probably the most quintessential question of the entire day. Then Powell gave us all the gold we were looking for. 

Paraphrasing btw: ""In the past you have used economic indicators and statistics to provide guidance ...on your decisions. Typically you have ignored ""forecasts.""  Yet today, you have used entirely forecasts to guide decision making.""  Then he essentially asked why the change? 

Powell fumbled HARD on this question and instantly the market retraced down... Powell did a great job of walking around the question but his micro-expressions were clear as glass.... you can see how the question caught him completely off guard.  (not sure what this means) 

My takeaway is simple, the Fed will do anything to maintain the status qou, even if this means ignoring economic indicators and using ""wishful thinking"" with forecasts. 

Later on in that same exact meeting, Jay powell answered another question from McKee. and I forget exactly what it was... But Jay said ""we can't move interest rates too fast or too soon as the economy is not yet strong enough to handle it."" 

When i heard this, my instantaneous thought was this... Wait... 

1. Market at all time highs
2. Burry says ""biggest everything speculative bubble."" 
3. Government has pulled back on stimmy. 
4. BUT THE ECONOMY ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR A RATE HIKE?

JAY POWELL SHOULD HAVE SAID: The stock market is not the economy, and frankly the economy is not strong and can't hang right now.  

Doesn't this actually mean that Powell just stated, the market is way overvalued? i think so.. but frankly the market is so complex and behavioural analytics would provide more foresight than a damn MACD or OBV. 

So business as usual, maybe hike rates in 2023. 

This meeting today reminded me of Bernake's meeting pre-crash 08...   I remember later on Fed said they didn't have the right economic indicators to predict the crash.  Powell today choose to ignore indicators, state that inflation is transitory and nothing to worry about. He said indicators to prove transitory narrative was lumber and used cars. 

I don't think used car prices will come down for a few reasons. 

1. chip shortage

When the bronco came out, i really wanted to throw an order down but thought it was the dumbest potential move i could do. (no holding uvxy from 65 down to $4 was worse) 

The other day i priced my 16' Expedition at carmax. They will literally give me more money for it, than what i paid for it in 18'. (and i've put 100k miles on it since then). 

I realized, wow... maybe i should upgrade right now. Whats better than a bronco? A Defender. 

Built and priced it out. Website said 6 weeks wait. 

I called the dealership. They're completely sold out of 2021 models. everywhere. They're now selling 2022 and it is a 6 month wait. I don't see used car prices going down much over the next 6-12 months when supply is still dictating the direction of prices due to supply chain shortages. 

Its not just land rover than can't deliver. Go look at your car dealerships... Inflation is here to stay."
2021-06-16 21:48:32,wallstreetbets,"I’m a 🌈🐻when I need to be but you’re all too early and this auto argument you’re using is flawed. 

Auto cut production in 2020 when everyone thought Covid was going to ravage the global economy and consumer spending power would disappear. (Remember that, bears? That’s back when you were all claiming Covid will crash the global economy). 

Basically, the opposite happened and people ended up earning & saving money at rates we’ve never seen. The demand for goods like cars spiked during a time where supply was limited. 

Auto manufacturing is now on the opposite end of the spectrum. They’re pumping out cars and will subsequently flood the market with supply ASAP. The price of used cars will go down faster than my wife with her new boyfriend. 

The bond market is much more interesting to look at if you’re an aspiring 🌈🐻. It’s way oversold. The fed is basically keeping the bond market in a coma on life support."
2021-06-16 22:19:47,wallstreetbets,Did he mention anything about countries getting rid of USD reserves and the US monetizing debt?
2021-06-16 20:04:57,wallstreetbets,"That ""plunge protection team"" is half of what the Fed does... in effect what the Fed is trying to do most often is make the market predictable for the big money. They have to signal well in advance their actions, so the big money can move to the new thing before the bubble pops.

Ok, but what happens when everything is a bubble and one pop could set off a chain reaction? Where does big money go then?"
2021-06-16 21:23:49,wallstreetbets,"I think he wants to raise interest rates because of inflation, but won't because the economy is still recovering from the pandemic. Also he wants to see how the spending in Biden's budget will impact the economy."
2021-06-16 21:40:08,wallstreetbets,"They can't move on anything until forbearance clears and these people have a few months to get back on their feet.  They're trying to let these people who got laid off through no fault or their own get reemployed and refinance, and they're blowing the housing bubble up a bit to try to keep it from imploding in the near term.  

Everything else is just smoke and mirrors.  They can't come out and say that they're seriously worried about forbearance.

https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2021-05-19/how-to-ease-out-of-mortgage-forbearance-avoid-foreclosure

Don't expect much out of Jackson hole, it's too soon.  I would think an October taper tantrum may be in order.

This could explain part of why reverse repo market started exploding in April (6 month lead time?), which also coincided with near term forbearance risk until they extended it. 

4 quick theories on reverse repo:

1)  Big banks would rather earn nothing and wait for more attractive risk adjusted yields.  <-- prevailing theory

2)  They also want to keep some powder dry to cover other loans on the commercial and small business side that they are in danger of taking losses on.

3)  They have excess savings on hand as people have reduced spending, and may spend large chunks of that quickly as things open back up.

4)  Put on your tinfoil hat - there may be a bigger bank they're more worried about, and don't trust lending to anybody, lest there be a Lehman moment.  See point number 2.  Any guesses on which bank it might be?

Open to other theories... let me know."
2021-06-16 21:33:57,wallstreetbets,"The thing that rankled me is JPow mentioned that new workers are getting pretty large wage increases, but it’s not a huge issue because in place workers are not.

Hello? You don’t think current employees are going to begin demanding wage increases or they will leave.

I am floating my resume out again, partially since I am due to a more senior title and want to move to a different state or work remote full time, but also because I think I can get 40%+ more pay on the open market.

I’d approach my current employer but the pay and benefits are mediocre to begin with, and we won’t raise pay for warehouse workers when we have major labor shortages that are preventing us from meeting our insane demand. If they can’t pay $5 bucks an hour more for much needed labor, they won’t give me a 30% raise because of market conditions."
2021-06-16 21:56:42,wallstreetbets,$65 -> $4. Imagine if Powell thought that was intelligent behavior. You guys are literally begging for a crash.
2021-06-17 01:11:31,wallstreetbets,All good points 👍 but is it massive inflation of everything or is it the death spiral deflation of the USD and other currencies.

2021-06-17 02:19:31,wallstreetbets,"It was always my understanding that when the Yanks let their dollar fall it boosts the ""Made in USA' sector. Manufacturing,exports etc. In CAN for example, when the Loonie meets or surpasses  the US dollar it makes us less competitive globally for obvious reasons.. but we are then able to consume a shit tonne of US goods and services. Technology, tourism , transportation etc..which are made by US workers. I see this as a strategic move by your FED to sell some goods to its trading partners which will get more folks back to work and will ultimately boost wage on both sides of our border. I think the 'decline' of the green back is intentional. And as per usual, USA will lead the world into another cycle of prosperity."

Here’s what I found out: 

1.) They launched some cute colorful non-smart 4G phones and India is excited. 

https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/news/nokia-110-4g-nokia-105-4g-feature-phones-launched-prices-start-at-around-rs-3-100/ar-AAL5ryi

2.) Said phones are considered super affordable in Europe, and Europe is down for it.

https://www.phonearena.com/news/nokia-105-nokia-110-official_id132878

3.) Georgia has contracted with Nokia to update their infrastructure from 4G to 5G. And they have a bunch of contracts with private entities to do the same.

https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/06/15/Leon-selects-nokia-for-core-network-modernization-in-georgia/

4.) They’re now cash flow positive and this dude did math and says that they should be able to start paying out dividends of 31.5 cents/share. His fancy numbers also say this brings fair value to $6.63/share (why he wouldn’t round to a good sensible 6.66, idk).

https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nok-stok-clear-free-cash-flow-prospect-for-dividend-high-1030528887

5.) Options activity is up and bullish:

Disclaimer: This is not investment advice, just the recounting of another one-sided romantic rendezvous between a smooth brain and google.

TL;DR:

Nokia is low priced + stable + quietly building the freeways of 5G in several pockets of the world = good long term hold with high chance of tendies. 

Or maybe not, idk.

Insider selling is fine. It’s a good way to keep employees paid while preserving cash flow for growth.

Eagletree is a little bit more of a temporary issue, but that selling will become less significant as volume picks up and is still overstated. Traded at least 3 times the volume that eagle tree holds in the last 3 days."

He didn't need $16 million immediately, he waited patiently for the stock to hit $40 before he sold.

To be clear: I like and use Corsair products and I'd like to like their stock. I also think it is worth a lot more than it's trading for. But until the board agrees with me, it's hard to believe I should hold long term."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I think after I'm done with donkey Kong's $DKNG IMA PUT IT ALL INTO TESLA lmk what u think Shares of Tesla closed lower despite a strong call from Mizuho.

Analysts at the firm reiterated their buy rating on the stock, citing the company's leadership in the global electric vehicle market and expecting the stock to get a boost from the Biden administration's proposed infrastructure plan. 


Michael Bapis, managing director of Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management, told CNBC on Tuesday that Tesla's roughly 24% market share and ambitions in the electric vehicle, space and clean energy markets make it a name worth watching.

""Tesla is going to continue to be the leader in the industry, especially for the foreseeable future,"" Bapis said on ""Trading Nation."" ""When you think Tesla, you think innovation.""

He expects the company to keep delivering strong sales and earnings growth, which he said could raise demand for the stock.

""If you look at some of these institutional funds ... and they don't have this stock in there, they're definitely going to get questioned why,"" he said.

Although Tesla did run up ""too far, too fast"" last year as people piled into the stock, Bapis said now is a great time to buy the dip.


""Unless someone comes in and breaks through the difficult barriers to entry, you're going to see this stock grow long term,"" he said. ""Any time you get the chance to buy it, buy it.""

He added that although its supply chain has been riddled with delays and shortages, Tesla was a strong long-term buy considering its fundamentals and growth potential. 

""I think it's the time to buy it right now and just put it away,"" he said. ""Close your eyes on the volatility for a little bit and bet on the fundamentals and the leadership of the company. I mean, you can't get a better leader than they have.""

In the same ""Trading Nation"" interview, Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, noted that Tesla's stock has been relatively flat for the past several months, trading around its 200-day moving average.

infographic
""You don't see that very often,"" he said. ""Whichever way it breaks away from that 200-day moving average will give us a little bit of a hint [about] its next move.""

The stock is also forming a descending triangle pattern, Maley said, saying the upper end of the pattern is around $650 and the lower end sits at $563. Those are the two levels to watch, and where shares move relative to those levels will be very indicative of where Tesla is headed, he said.

""In the past, when the stock has been stuck in this sideways range, once it breaks out, it starts to move in a big way. This should be no different,"" he said.

Tesla's deliveries report in the first week of July could be a breakout catalyst, Maley said.

Disclosure: Bapis's family and Vios Advisors own shares of Tesla.

2021-06-16 23:57:28,wallstreetbets,"I have a rough understanding, but still learning. 
I believe It depends on the Greeks.
For example, we will use NOK (Nokia). 

A call for a strike of $5.50 expiring June 18th is going for $0.02 or $2 a contract. 
If you look at the Greeks (on Robinhood, click on the option, then click on the bid-ask to see them): 
Delta is: 0.1519 
Theta is: -0.0182 

Delta tells you that for every dollar that the stock increases, the overall price of the contract increases by 0.1519. 
Theta is the value the contract loses per day. 

Now we look at a call expiring in 2023 
The same call goes for $1.12 or $112 per contract.
Delta: .5842 
Theta: -0.0010


When trading options, from what’ve been told, it’s less risky if you purchase a call option 3 to 6+ months in the future. There’s more time for you to make money on your investment. 
However, Options expiring in less than a month generally have more risk and are cheap af (in most cases). With greater risk comes greater reward. 

Read up on options. It’s complicated as fuck and take my understanding with a grain of salt, because i don’t fully understand them."

2021-06-16 23:56:24,wallstreetbets,"Gme is a struggling retail chain, the stock price as it stands is completely disconnected from the business fundamentals.

Amc was a failing theater chain before the pandemic.  Their stock price reflected that.  Back in January their stock price was totally justified.  I bought some when it was below two bucks thinking it would pop up if they secured funding to keep themselves from bankruptcy.  It was a risk but I didn't buy much of it.  They got it and took on a load of debt and it did pop up.  The people saw when short positions were being closed out left and right during the GME saga what a little buying pressure and a market anomaly can do the the price.  I cashed my shares out the. At 16.00 a piece and never touched it again as their financials didn't support it anymore.

Wish has done well at one thing, making customers hate them. Their reviews reflect that.  When you piss off customers that frequently and you don't sell anything so unique or necessary you're doomed to fail.  Last three quarters they run NET losses in the 8-9 figure range. Revenue is irrelevant when you're continuing to lose money every single quarter, and so much of the public won't use your business again."
2021-06-17 07:49:07,wallstreetbets,Yea and the dollar store security get beat up or even killed dumb ass. This is the way.
2021-06-17 00:10:13,wallstreetbets,"So you’re saying there is no reason for AMC or GME to be where they are at (based on facts of business model) 

OK now let’s do WISH . Fundamentally yeah it’s not the best company but you haven’t factored in chart technicals and the memefication of it over the past few days.

I get you want to save people and tell them to invest in *better* *safer* stocks *but* this is *WSB* and if people would have listened to you about AMC and your opinion on financials - they would have missed an epic run to $60+ (like you did) 

If it can happen with AMC & GME,  it *can* happen with *WISH* 

Will it? Idk. No one knows. No one knew amc or GME would for sure happen- lots of people including myself didn’t believe it was possible but look where they are are now. The beginning of WISH is very similar to AMC and GME - you can’t deny that. If you do deny it.. well, go spend your time on investor forums.

Would you value an option expiring tomorrow the same as you would one that was expiring in December? 

Would you value an option that has radical fucking volume / volatility the same as one that has been stubbornly immovable? 

You wouldn’t. More time + more volatility = more value. 

Extrinsic value is all about the potential** of a strike being met."
2021-06-17 00:31:03,wallstreetbets,"Wish has more apes that hate it than like it.

Most people here freely admit the prices of gme and AMC left their fundamentals behind.  

Gme was a beautiful reality check to aggressive, abusive shorting.  I absolutely loved the run up and the fallout for hedgehogs.  It was a once in a lifetime event.

Amc not as much but still a good example of heavy shorting of a company alot of people actually liked.

Wish has none of those things.  People don't like it.  They are not creating a loyal following of repeat business."
2021-06-17 08:51:21,wallstreetbets,"Ill check them out, thanks."
2021-06-16 22:58:02,wallstreetbets,Mr. financial adviser over here guys omg

2021-06-16 23:35:44,wallstreetbets,Nope just don't like seeing idiots taken advantage of.  I've got a soft spot for the mentally deficient.
2021-06-16 23:48:45,wallstreetbets,Ahh yes that explains your ego.
2021-06-16 23:57:32,wallstreetbets,"What ego, I just put facts out there and call out missinformation.  When I see it."
2021-06-17 07:53:30,wallstreetbets,"The only fact you have is that they sell cheap stuff. This guy forgets, we have over 7 billion people in this world. Hey numb nuts, what do you think the median income is??? 🧐🧐🧐🧐"
2021-06-17 09:22:40,wallstreetbets,"And the majority of the world doesn't shop online for garbage.  Watch their next quarter, will be more losses"
2021-06-17 10:26:57,wallstreetbets,Yes they do. I know it’s not as big in America then the rest of the world. Americans have more options but the rest of the world doesn’t. I’m just saying… I don’t order from them Bc I’m not in need of something like that. But the concept I like. I’m here to stay and I believe long term it’s a great investment.
2021-06-17 10:37:45,wallstreetbets,"Only 60% of the worlds population has internet access. 

You don't order from them.  That should tell you what people with disposable income will think of it.

Many people will try it once or twice and never use it again because of the massive problems the site has.

World is opening back up, so less people sitting around bored shopping for garbage they dont need.

Next quarter is going to be a train wreck"
2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Was going to put a down payment on a house but I bought these instead.. Teachers always told me I wasn't that bright

Look, I wish you nothing but the best.  But good god.  Bless your heart, good luck, I love you."
2021-06-16 22:10:13,wallstreetbets,"OP this may not be the wisest of plays, but you got guts and sometimes guts is enough.

2021-06-17 08:19:14,wallstreetbets,I bought the same contract just to cheer you on.
2021-06-17 08:26:23,wallstreetbets,"I have **bigly** doubt that this is real. If it is though, this is just wonderfully horrible and at the same time i can not watch but i also kind of want to watch."

2021-06-17 08:35:40,wallstreetbets,"Relax... There's still hope.. AMC can drop to 48 today if 52 support doesn't hold.. After that, we should shoot back up.."
2021-06-17 09:04:15,wallstreetbets,"Idiot. You fucking idiot just lost 230k $      
I know dollars are worth shit anymore, but this is still a stupid play.

edit:  
You didn't buy at open yesterday, but during the big drip? In that case the play isn't that stupid. It's just a little less stupid."
2021-06-16 21:49:10,wallstreetbets,I recommend a google search: theta basics.
2021-06-16 20:24:12,wallstreetbets,"ok, i have a question...you have 700 contracts (200 @ 2.80 and 500 @ 3.40). Strike price on both is $58, currently OTM. If Friday comes and goes and these turn ITM, say AMC goes to $60, they get exercised which means you will need to purchase 70,000 shares at $58 (700 contracts \* 100 shares per contract), or roughly $4,000,000...what happens if you dont have that much in your account?"
2021-06-16 23:56:19,wallstreetbets,"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-retail-nyse/meme-stock-prices-may-not-properly-reflect-demand-nyse-president-idUSL2N2NY32L

2021-06-17 11:35:45,wallstreetbets,"And 150K is gone within 10 minutes.

Was there with GME. One day I was up 460K and the next day I sold them with 19K loss. If I didn't sell them and hold one more day then I would have lost all of my 50K."

2021-06-17 09:28:46,wallstreetbets,"Someone explain this. I have skin in the game, but not lose a house dp skin. So, even with the WB announcement yesterday saying they will home and movie release simultaneously (which for me spells the beginning of the end of theaters), I would say that AMC would need to come up with a massively innovative plan to redefine the movie goer experience. Until Marvel starts hitting the big screen again, there is literally nothing I want to see and shell out $100+ (family of four) for 2 hours of entertainment. Like really?? Other than all of us ""loving the stock"". What will keep it from plummeting? Why should i continue to hold? Love this guy's bold trust that it will rocket (i hope too). Please explain this too me."

2021-06-16 20:37:14,wallstreetbets,"I like the TA. Cup and handle formed. I like the testing we've done and staying above between 54 and 60 range. To be honest it's also a prayer that quad witching, the fact they've been bleeding billions of dollars for the past 6 weeks, think we can get a final push over 64 and make them start Delta hedging. I don't think they have the 60s hedged for. They sold them to try and drive the price down."
2021-06-17 10:22:30,wallstreetbets,at expiry yes but before then time value gives extra value.
2021-06-17 10:20:52,wallstreetbets,"Yes, if he holds to expiry"
2021-06-17 10:53:34,wallstreetbets,Nice! Took balls to buy in the red this morning. Congrats!
2021-06-17 11:01:09,wallstreetbets,So he can start unloading his position since AMC is $59 rn?
2021-06-17 11:25:02,wallstreetbets,Says +700 in gray text right under the contract
2021-06-17 12:23:06,wallstreetbets,Damn where do you live? Where I live that’s not even enough for a down payment.
2021-06-16 21:55:20,wallstreetbets,That is hardly best case. Best cases we break 62 and start a gamma screen squeeze turning into margin call short squeeze..
2021-06-16 21:59:32,wallstreetbets,You're assuming AMC runs with the market. I see it helping AMC creating liquidity issues for shorts who are already down almost 3 billion dollars this month maybe speeding up margin calls.
2021-06-17 00:04:20,wallstreetbets,Congrats on the new house!!

2021-06-16 21:53:24,wallstreetbets,This is not Apple. I said it's not a smart play but at the same time this stock can run 10 percent to 100% on any given day. High risk High reward.
2021-06-16 20:41:01,wallstreetbets,My brokerage would sell the contracts at close

2021-06-17 02:31:00,wallstreetbets,Brother I know you're getting tired of hearing it. But there are only two legit plays. There's about 10 to 15 stocks that got pumped last week that have calls expiring Friday. Only AMC and gme have had shorts bleeding for over a month where there desperately trying to get out of.
2021-06-17 11:36:31,wallstreetbets,"I don't care I'm holding till tomorrow. I'm either going to be up over a million or lose 200,000."
2021-06-17 14:19:47,wallstreetbets,No he’s not. He’s made money
2021-06-17 17:34:28,wallstreetbets,He's up 100% right now
2021-06-16 21:57:27,wallstreetbets,Yes I would appreciate him helping me here.
2021-06-16 22:03:23,wallstreetbets,I don't care what it's at Tomorrow opening I care what it's at Friday afternoon. Also you're assuming AMC is going to run with the market. I bit presumptuous.

2021-06-17 00:47:07,wallstreetbets,I bet a quarter million dollars that AMC will get to at least $61 by close on Friday
2021-06-17 00:46:16,wallstreetbets,Don't care about cars.. I'll literally travel the world and rent a 3 bedroom house when I get back.

2021-06-17 02:17:55,wallstreetbets,Funny. People told me the same thing last week when wish was at $11 and AMC was at $40.

2021-06-17 10:11:40,wallstreetbets,Lol what are your talking about
2021-06-16 22:30:52,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you it's more about 20% to 25%. But I think you have to add in the implied odds... If it does get into the money it has a high probability to get past the low 60s and push to at least 72 (intraday all time high)  because of Delta hedging, fomo, and that's the next closest resistance. So I have a 75 percent /80 percent chance to lose 200,000 but I also have a 20 to 25% chance to make (5x) 1 million."
2021-06-17 09:04:05,wallstreetbets,"He holds 700 coupons that says ""Whoever holds this coupon on 6/18 can buy 100 shares of AMC for 58$ a share"". Those 700 coupons are valued at 250k right now, however if the price falls below 58$. The coupons will expire worthless on 6/18 because no one will want the coupon if market price is below 58$ anyway. He paid 250k for those coupons (premium). AMC needs to be above 62$-ish for him to see profit on these. Think ($62 ($market)-58(strike))*100 shares * 700 contracts. Subtracting the 250,000 premium leaves him with 30k profit."
2021-06-17 06:24:28,wallstreetbets,"If he exercised it would be 700x100x58.

2021-06-17 11:04:40,wallstreetbets,It depends if I think the price is going to keep going up. Basically I think if it breaks the 60 to 62 dollars it can run up to low 70s

2021-06-17 12:27:35,wallstreetbets,"So can you help those of us too pussy to get into options understand.  Why would OP have bought calls that expire so soon.  Is there a discount on them because it's insane?  What would it have cost him to set the expiration dates out 6 months from now vs friday (just guesstimate).

As someone who know nothing, this seems reckless.  As someone who can understand the reactions of others here, this also seems reckless.

If people believe in MOASS (which is why they are investing at this point after it's up so high), why not just buy fucking shares?"

2021-06-16 21:37:55,wallstreetbets,If the price stays the same overnight these will likely start the day down 25-50% because of theta burn. If it gaps down these could be down 75%+ and it won’t take a big gap down. Hope it gaps up above $60 though so these print for OP.
2021-06-16 23:12:51,wallstreetbets,Yes but time decay will take a large chuck of it per day not including the lost of $ if the stock moves down so for him to make money the stock needs to move up fast very soon. Good luck to him

2021-06-16 21:00:26,wallstreetbets,This is the way. I admire your big balls and retard logic.
2021-06-16 20:55:49,wallstreetbets,"haha i just wonder if a situation could arise where these get exercised, underlying position puts your account in too much of a deficit and it gets restricted, stock price goes down before you can sell your shares and collect those sweet tendies"
2021-06-17 02:41:58,wallstreetbets,Imagine your money pushing it to 13 for Friday. For your ape brothers!
2021-06-17 11:43:12,wallstreetbets,Looks like you’ve doubled already. Sell half to get your basis back and let the rest ride

2021-06-17 00:55:39,wallstreetbets,This is retarded AF.  Exactly what’s been missing here lately.  I can’t wait to see your update with 7 figure gains after Friday!  I want an invite to the after party.  If it’s as crazy as this play it will be legendary.  I’d say good luck but I think you have this in the bag already lol.
2021-06-16 22:39:15,wallstreetbets,Apartment building of course. Gotta be legit about finances.
2021-06-16 23:29:51,wallstreetbets,"yeah but the thing that doesn't make sense about the play is that youre at best gonna earn like 50% returns here since the theta decay is gonna fk you so hard.  Youre risking 100% for a max imo of 50%.  Im pretty sure its not gonna moon tomorrow so yeah not the best play ive ever see, hope it works out for you though.

not to mention the 32% cap gains tax if you win and the unlikely chance of you being able to write the amount youre going to lose off with it being 3k+whatever you gained during the year max."
2021-06-16 23:20:05,wallstreetbets,Ehh. House is a house. boat never gets used because I work too much. You made the right choice
2021-06-16 23:44:42,wallstreetbets,Then why didn't you say that in your initial post? If you're playing with house money who gives a fuck? lol

2021-06-17 02:37:39,wallstreetbets,Yes but if you already hit the jackpot twice in a row then you’re running out of luck. Lol luck isn’t something like an exercise that improves the more you get lucky

2021-06-17 01:01:19,wallstreetbets,It ended up being 10k to 460k.. than I bought shares at $28 so at about 750k
2021-06-17 02:03:20,wallstreetbets,"Having high conviction plays helps. I know this is a black swan event.  This monthly option change has insane volume, I don't think hedges are hedged for the 59s and 60s.. than 70, 73s have massive volume. Even if I lose 200k I like the risk to reward of this play.

I lost 25k calls last week.. lost 25k on $80s expiring Friday .. I know the stock is volutile but want to be in high risk high reward plays when the stock makes big moves"
2021-06-17 19:20:40,wallstreetbets,"Ya, he said he would hold until tomorrow in case of a gamma squeeze. He says the reward is better than the risk considering he made $96k this morning off of $50c

I think he’s right. Risk $100k to make $2m? 🔥"
2021-06-17 10:51:05,wallstreetbets,"Does it matter tho? Could have been. Dude has big balls money, mentioned he was up 600k on amc already. Could have bought a lambo or a down payment on a house who cares point is it went to FD’s and I love him 😍"

2021-06-16 23:33:11,wallstreetbets,"You’re overthinking it man. He bought these calls, he didn’t sell them. There’s no way to put your account in a deficit from buying calls with your own buying power.

And to add to that, there’s no reason to exercise them anyways when you can just sell them on Friday before close."

2021-06-17 11:50:19,wallstreetbets,I already got 100K of my base is back this morning day trading the $50 calls. Letting it ride

2021-06-16 22:40:37,wallstreetbets,Good choice!
2021-06-16 23:38:36,wallstreetbets,"Theta decay won't matter if the price doesn't get over 60. If it does get into the low 60s there's a high probability hedge funds have not Delta hedged for the 59 and 60 calls which is millions of shares that would have to buy back and drop off the price. So basically I assume if the price hits low 60s there's a very high likelihood of a gamma squeeze at least two the next resistance which is $72 and the intraday all-time high. So I look at it as I could have an 80% chance to lose $200,000 but 20 percent chance I  could win one million. 

It's gambling."
2021-06-16 23:21:54,wallstreetbets,Well I hope you win some money and take some time off of work to enjoy life and your new boat

2021-06-17 02:43:34,wallstreetbets,"I'm okay if I lose. I'm putting my chips in when I believe I have the best odds. Thursday and Friday can easily Cause hedge farms to Delta hedge the 59 to 61 calls possibly push to 73. In my opinion I have 75% chance of losing 200,000 and a 25% chance of making my money back and possibly 5x my investment .  It's  a Numbers game and I like those odds. Just because AMC is a Black swan doesn't mean WISH going to do the same."
2021-06-17 02:26:00,wallstreetbets,Flip a coin for me and tell me what's going to happen
2021-06-17 10:34:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it is not as cut and dry as what I have explained, there are a lot of different factors that affect the option price. For example, in todays spike from 53-58, his options actually increased in price from the contracts implied volatility. Or just more so the ""thought"" that this will push way past 62. However, that implied volatility decreases the closer to the contracts expiration date (referred to as Theta Decay). Meaning, in two days time, AMC can run wild. However at 2 PM tomorrow afternoon, there is less of a chance it can jump 20$ before market close. Options are really interesting, very high risk high reward plays."
2021-06-17 11:10:48,wallstreetbets,"According to his average buy it would be around 60% gain if he sold, mainly because there aren’t enough bids and he wouldn’t be able to get the mark price. On paper it’s probably about 90% gain."

2021-06-17 18:51:37,wallstreetbets,"Definitely only retroactive. “Less than 1/5” is a bit of an exaggeration. It dropped to the $5 range. Approximately half of the value would have been lost.

Edit: if you want to have a realistic convo on it, real estate is a good or bad investment based on many variables. Yes, congrats to the user who saw an increase in home value - so did the rest of the state see a similar increase and moreso around the Puget Sound area since that’s where most of WA state’s money is. It’s a seller’s market currently but not as liquid as the (base example) SPY shares that saw a 35% increase in 1 year. That’s the same value increase but 3x faster than home appreciation.

Anyways, what do I know. I’m just another shmuck in WSB."

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ITUB - why a chad CEO's vision will keep this water HOT. It was a generational changing of the guard this year for Itaú Unibanco. 

The biggest financial services company in Brazil welcomed new CEO Milton Maluhy Filho. Just 44 years old, Maluhy took over from retiring Candido Bracher, and becomes the youngest bank boss in Brazil.


Despite their tremendous market power, Brazil's giant banks did not move to take advantage of the rapid spread of broadband internet and smartphones across the continent in the early 2010s.

That is all about to change.  Itaú has now launched app adapted for the M1 chip.  Since the first Macs with an M1 chip hit the market, Itaú customers were basically unable to access their accounts from their computer using the app — having to use only the iOS app or, of course, the browser. **This week, the bank released a version of the App Itaú no Computer duly adapted for Apple.**  (For Macs, two independent versions of the app are available for download: one for Intel (compatible with macOS 10.12 Sierra or higher) and one for M1 (compatible only with macOS Big Sur 11).

MOREOVER:  Itaú has partnered with fintech Rappi to provide greater access to financial services and products for retail and mass affluent clients in Chile. The agreement will allow customers to access the Brazilian bank and asset manager’s investment strategies digitally through Rappi’s phone app. 


MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER SMALL BUSINESS MARKET CAP: In Brazil, Itaú and Omie launch support platform for small and medium-sized businesses. The platform, called Itaú My Business, will feature several services for entrepreneurs, such as sales and service order management, financial management, automatic invoice issue, and integration with accountants.

CHAD CEO:

Brazil’s Itau Unibanco Holding SA will be more active in making acquisitions and forming partnerships with smaller competitors this year, Chief Executive Milton Maluhy told journalists on Wednesday. The bank is eying deals with companies in sectors such as payments and investments, he added, which will complement the portfolio of Brazil’s largest lender. Itau’s chief financial officer, Alexsandro Broedel, said that despite fierce competition, the bank sees its net interest income growth accelerating by year-end, with trading gains reaching the upper part of the outlook range, close to 6.4 billion reais ($1.26 billion).


WHO IS MILTON?  Milton Maluhy Filho became a director on January 1, 2019.  Previously, he was CEO of Rede S.A. (former Redecar S.A.), a card-processing subsidiary, and Executive Director at Itaú Unibanco, responsible for the management of the credit card segment and retail store alliances.  Prior to joining the bank, he worked at J.P. Morgan, Crédit Commercial de France (CCF Brazil) and Lloyds.

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is Tesla's Former Number 2 Going to Be Lordstown Motors New Number 1? &#x200B;

[Jerome Guillen Was Second In Command at Tesla and Left unexpectedly Last Week](https://preview.redd.it/yzmo64vrzo571.png?width=1841&format=png&auto=webp&s=6abe7f5e0a4e8b3dbb08635a42c142165d804436)

TLDR - **Tesla number 2 guy stepped down days before RIDE CEO Quit - Is he Coming to the Start Up?**

Current Position - **I own 100 long on $10 Oct strike calls and 2 common shares of stock** 

Last week, Jerome Guillen shocked the auto world by announcing his depature from Tesla. He was the second in command at the auto giant starting there in 2010 and his current role was the head of their truck division. While that took place, behind the scenes at Lordstown Motors another shakeup was underway and the company dropped a bomb that CEO and founder Steve Burns would be stepping down from his position along with CFO Julio Rodriguez. Guillen was the Tesla Model S Program Director and most likely had day to day interaction with Lordstown Motors President Rich Schmidt who was in charge of production and tooling for that project.

Did our partner GM persuade Guillen that this an oppertunity too good to pass up. With the Endurance trucks coming off the line in just a few months now and a shiny brand new battery plant being complete in the coming months from LG and GM partnership the time would be now to get in. His experiene with ramping up the gigafactory probably has GM salivating at his exeprtise helping to help with input on how to maximize the potential there. And you may wonder why Tesla would open for him to jump to a competitor which is reasonable but they probably want to be friendly to GM who will be helping their own supply line with the battery plant coming online.

With productiion so close, I would think that LMC fills this posistion and the timing of Guillen's departure from Tesla and Burns resigination at LMC I think there is a good chance we have some Tesla blood coming to Northeast Ohio which would send shockwaves throughout the auto world."
2021-06-16 20:03:57,wallstreetbets,"Jerome Guillen explained that Elon Musk would push them outside their comfort zone and they accomplished things that way. Without a visionary leader like Elon Musk, one has to wonder whether a guy like Guillen will be as creative or accomplish as much. If you listen to Straubel and Everhard who founded TSLA they say much the same. They both like Tesla and a are investors in it and are rooting for its success still. While they were there their experience with Elon was him pushing you beyond your comfort zone. Elon sees things others don't and  pushes and takes risks to get there that others will not.

Basically, all these guys are great, but without an Elon Musk driving them to achieve great things they will not accomplish the same. This is no different than working at Apple was under Steve Jobs. You might be the gun, but he was the one who pointed you in the right direction."

2021-06-16 20:31:59,wallstreetbets,I do believe Biden was just driving around in the Lightning
2021-06-16 20:23:05,wallstreetbets,"Why do you keep talkikg about gm overseeing this?

GM doesn't need lordstown nor workhorse"
2021-06-16 23:48:24,wallstreetbets,"Amazon is backing LEV, But I posted Jerome Guillem coming to LMC immediately after Burns resigned. Because the timing lines up"
2021-06-16 21:01:41,wallstreetbets," RIDE has nothing left to offer. GMs initial ""investment "" was essentially buying their way out of Youngstown, and a plant that couldn't be sold to anyone.  Nothing from the Cruise tooling is usable to RIDE. RIDE has nothing left to offer big daddy GM. GM already owns 3 years of rights to their future EV credits.  If they succeed. Brightdrop,should be a clear indicator  to you. That GM doesn't give a rats ass about WKHS. And certainly won't be buying them out. Not that it would help RIDE in any way if that happened anyway. WKHS and RIDE are separate entities."
2021-06-16 21:09:06,wallstreetbets,I don't trust being in a China stock for a long time.  For a short day-trade maybe is fine.  I just don't trust them.
2021-06-17 03:47:41,wallstreetbets,Because not everyone is a ceo man. Being a manager or assistant manager of a division at a company is a very different game
2021-06-16 20:39:05,wallstreetbets,GM does need RIDE for carbon credits and probably will be cutting them a nice deal on a loan soon.
2021-06-16 21:29:38,wallstreetbets,GM is going to buyout LMC
2021-06-16 21:07:37,wallstreetbets,GM owns a big piece of Lordstown Motors already.
2021-06-16 21:04:51,wallstreetbets,"You and are clearly reading things differntly and I think as soon as 4 days from now it will be clear that I am correct and you are mistaken. 

GM wants to cut the middleman out of sales (the dealership) and RIDE is the perfect entitiy to do so. That was the only reason they nearly got into bed with the scag NKLA and then realized she had HIV. LMC is legit and the big funds pulled off that FUD to load cheap."
2021-06-16 20:41:05,wallstreetbets,Lordstown you are getting on the ground floor right before production in a 6 million square feet factory. That isn't a leaky ship. That is a money printer.
2021-06-16 21:11:45,wallstreetbets,"Your clearly mistaken. GM is not trying to get away from dealerships. And have never given any indication anywhere ever that they were. GMs dealer network. Is the backbone of the company.  And if for some reason they did.  It would make zero sense in any way shape or form to use RIDE as a means to do so. Jesus Christ you guys just make shit up as you go.  If GM wanted to go dealer less. They can't by the way.  You know, pesky contractual obligations and state laws and all. But if they did. And could. They would just throw a few billion at the problem and do it in house."
2021-06-16 20:46:39,wallstreetbets,How many vehicles per year is the factory capacity? How many vehicles on the road currently? What are their battery ranges? How fast do they charge? How many vehicles orders do they have? Do they have Battery swap capabilities as well as a lifestyle brand that promises diversified streams of revenue? Are they government backed to the point of receiving bailout money when they need it? These are all things that NIO surpasses RIDE/ just flat out has it and RIDE doesnt

2021-06-16 20:29:08,wallstreetbets,"NIO is delivering 10s of thousands of cars a quarter in China. Outside of Tesla, they are as legit as it gets for an EV maker."

They are at a current capacity of 60k vehicles per year and presales are now sold out and are booked solid through 2022. They have 30k sales lined up that are termed as ""solid"" and that equates to $1.6 billion in forward revenue so this is trading for dirt cheap right now with tons of room to grow. I believe the battery range is 250 miles and they are conculding the Beta builds and have achieved 5 star crash test ratings on all tests thus far and will come to market as the safest pick up truck ever made. First orders will shipped in Jan 2022. They are awaiting news on a DOE Loan which would be the first one given out in over a decade the last being to Tesla and by all reports will be granted the money."

2021-06-16 20:58:47,wallstreetbets,As stated they are ending the Beta builds now and awaiting on the final tests from the federal gov't of safety. Either you want to play a great American story or you want to play a Chinese company with a current valuation of more than 40x that of the start up. My money is the Americans and the first ever EV pickup and soon to be announced RV.

Btw I had a thought that Chinese money could be behind all the negative articles on literally every American EV company and that could be why those same articles that shows up on my google are all super positive about nio. Just a thought."

2021-06-16 21:24:05,wallstreetbets,No idea. Never heard of a legitimate company being delisted. But my market experience is limited. Since both Blackrock and the California pension fund have positions in NIO im personally quite fine with them as a company. There is no going back from the global economy unless WW3 haopens.
2021-06-16 21:16:23,wallstreetbets,"That definitely happens. But NIO is a real company, with real sales, and real customers. FsKR,  Lucid,  RIDe, NKlA are all just wannabes. All have been shady, misleading, or outright failed already once. Just a bunch of maybes competing in an industry where Musk is the only successful startup in 100 years."
2021-06-16 21:17:02,wallstreetbets,Just giving you shit. Everyone has to start somewhere! You just see so many clowns fronting on Reddit about owning a bullshit amount of shares in every ticker knowing they are holding like 1.3 shares in a single ticker.

2021-06-16 21:29:05,wallstreetbets,Haha I agree! And whatever happened to “proof or ban”? Never see it anymore but it’s a good way to cut through the BS
2021-06-16 21:40:37,wallstreetbets,And thats the thing. All these other EV companies don't have. Elon Musks vision or  timing. He came in as the only player. Now its a crowded field of startups
2021-06-16 21:13:25,wallstreetbets,The percentage of increase is what matters.
2021-06-16 21:47:07,wallstreetbets,"But the people in power want EV to happen. Can’t forget that aspect. They’re open to it. And Lordstown has the plant. They’ve been retooling. They have a step up above the other startups with that. They passed crash tests, they’re so close. I’m just waiting for them to drop some crazy out of left field bad news on me like “oh we have the money to proceed but didn’t get the clearance” or some other bullshit, that’s how it’s been for the last few months! But on the other hand I think they easily could hire a big name ceo and get a bump in SP, go into Lordstown week and announce they passed ALL the other crash tests, announce an investor or that they got the gov loan, and get some footage of people test driving the trucks out there and we could see a nice bump. I could see either scenario happening. Plus the short interest is high so there’s only so much float out there. This stock has shown that even with a little bit of buy pressure it moves up fast. Excited to see what happens"
2021-06-16 21:50:15,wallstreetbets,"EV is happening,  with or without Lordstown. Rivian starts delivery next month. F GM and Tesla will be out next year. RIDE has enormous volume propping up the price. People want to get in early and get rich. Doesnt mean the company will make it. Just speculative investors. Trying to make a buck."
2021-06-16 21:51:14,wallstreetbets,"Yes true but I’m just saying, it’s a unique time. At least one of these companies will make it. Hopefully"
2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$3.53 Million worth of $MOMO...(Very Overlooked) &#x200B;

[\(ME\) Main Broker](https://preview.redd.it/i4y8dvnjzo571.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89a6733e6aeef02e77ff586745d5e921bd29389c)

I recently made the decision to purchase over $3.53 Million of the stock $MOMO. By now you must be aware that I am a ""Contrarian Compound Value Investor"" and my goal is to buy $1.00 for $0.50. In other words, I love buying assets. I tend to shed away from speculating and like to stick to facts, after all, numbers never lie. (Unless, of course, you are a Chinese company cooking the books and deceiving investors.) MOMO is a Chinese company, so this would be my only concern...but to be honest I don't believe this company would change things to extreme levels. They are practically the ""Tinder"" or ""Bumble"" of China. They also provide live content via great apps on mobile which makes them a mini-facebook live type. In other words, I believe they are too big and well known to put their reputation on the line. They are very popular and many users make a living off them. The bulk of revenue comes from live streaming where users donate money and tip users, then momo takes a small fee.

**Why has it crashed?**  
The first struggle they faced was a decrease of users, this caused some panic amongst investors, and it's what started the first selling of the stock. Right after, we got hit with COVID-19, and the worldwide pandemic slowed many apps down like Tantan this is a dating app so people weren't using the app trying to meet up and date others. it also affected other businesses within it which all caused the second wave of selling, the third wave came in when the overall market started to crash which caused more panic, and then finally there was an even further dropping in the stock which took it to new lows since the peak when Chinese stocks got hit with a possible ban from US market. I don't want to get too much into it all but because of all this fear, because of all these problems that's why we have this opportunity to come in and buy it up cheap. This is where my ""contrarian"" mindset comes in. When everyone is fearful, be greedy. When nobody is looking, when no one cares about it, and when no one is giving it the attention I want it. You see the goal is to buy a skirt in winter for cheap when no one is buying it, to sell them for more during summer when the demand is high. *P.S they have recovered their users and are breaking user highs again.*

**What do the numbers tell us?**  
Again, I don't want to get too much into it but they have a strong balance sheet. From when I bought the stock their market cap was at $2.97 Billion, $532 Million of that is held in cash. Another, $1.2 Billion is held in short-term investments. That's a total of $1.74 Billion just in Total Cash & ST Investments. let's not forget this company is profitable... their total debt is $754.1 which can easily be paid. This leaves them at Debt/Eq and an LT Debt/Eq of only 0.32 which is a great ratio. You typically want it under 0.50. (As a value investor) This is also a tech stock, which usually trades at a higher multiple on their P/E side. This stock can easily trade 20-30 times on P/E. In other words, we can see this stock trading upwards of $40! I don't usually use this model but even looking at the DCF it gives it a value of $ 20.52. While it trades at $15 as of this post. DCF based on FCF is at a higher $28 per share. I see no sign of bankruptcy here either.

**Takeaway?**  
They are very undervalued, this is a typical contrarian type stock. The balance sheet is strong. I believe they will turn things around within operations and business and it'll slowly start to gain attention. More people like me, retail investors will start to notice there is value here and over time start bidding up the price. Smart money owns this under $16.

**MOMO Summary:**  
📄Momo Inc. provides mobile-based social and entertainment services. The company's Momo mobile application connects people and facilitates interactions based on location and interests; and various recreational activities, live talent shows, short videos, and social games, as well as other video- and audio-based interactive experiences, such as live chats and mobile karaoke experience. It also operates Tantan, a social and dating application for the younger generation, which enables users to find and establish romantic connections, and meet interesting people as well as mobile games."

2021-06-16 23:19:26,wallstreetbets,"The rate isn’t what matters and it can be manipulated or not depending on the variant, the population, etc. look at vox for an explanation for those who are not familiar with design of experiments."
2021-06-17 02:04:58,wallstreetbets,"It's not too bad tbh, have you looked up the efficacy of flu vaccines? They have been 50% at best and they have been around for a long time. Of course it's not as good as the other covid vaccines we have with around 90% efficacy, but it would be interesting to see seperate numbers for each variant."
2021-06-17 14:08:22,wallstreetbets,What’s the expectation for a rebound?
2021-06-17 10:04:05,wallstreetbets,"No, 47% efficacy means that it has 47% fewer cases than placebo.
A negative efficacy value would mean that the vaccine is worst than placebo.

A total of 124 confirmed COVID-19 cases were observed so far from ~40,000 participants.
Of these 124 confirmed cases, 81 are from the placebo arm, and 43 are from the vaccine arm.
Subjects were assigned 50-50 to the placebo and vaccine arms.

So, there are 47% fewer cases in the vaccine arm. An ineffective vaccine would be have efficacy <= 0%.

Obviously, the 47% efficacy, while much higher than 0% (placebo), is still disappointing."

Prerevenue is high risk high reward.

Except, it’s not that high risk. Things are falling into place as they should, as they were advertised.

You can wait and see, but then the stock price will be higher than it is Moe. Significantly so.

All I wonder is for anyone who is so certain it’ll fail, why don’t they take short positions. You bears speak with such conviction, such certainty, but when asked to put your money where your mouth is, you’re less certain.

I’m certain with 4,500 shares.

It's why lordstown was pushed to answer if they had binding pre orders.  Shocking, they don't because the demand is not there for these vehicles.  If they did have interest and demand they wouldn't have faked the pre order figures.

2021-06-16 21:27:07,wallstreetbets,Show me where to place that bet. And I'm not talking about F. Already in that. It will be F GM Rivian Tesla in that order within 3 years. Its not company altering. They aren't gonna become Tesla all of a sudden. 50k electric trucks a year will hardly dent Fs bottom line.

2021-06-16 21:37:26,wallstreetbets,"I'm good. You seem to be making some weird leap that I'm not saying. Having the #1 selling electric truck means nothing to Fs bottom line short term. Its just an educated guess that they will. I'd predict 50k a year within 3 years.  Compared to 900k ICE trucks. With GM right behind. Followed by Rivian and Tesla. Its definitely not an all in on F thing. Now for Rivian, or others that might be a make or break number. Not for F tho. Just gonna be another small part of the brand that grows as time goes on."

There is one on the off-road track no camo body and fully functioning.  

Again taken through all major driving conditions that s truck is used for.  Regular road conditions and speed, towing in extreme grades and taken off road.

Lordstown has done none of these things"
2021-06-16 21:56:19,wallstreetbets,"There is zero risk for F. EVs are here to stay. Within a decade probably, mandatory by law. At least on a limited basis. F played this game as safe as you possibly could. By making it look exactly like the best selling vehicle in America.  The debt loads or other issues they have as a company don't change because of this. The hype around it and the Mach E have clearly been beneficial to both the company and stock price."

2021-06-16 21:27:52,wallstreetbets,"If that were true, Ford wouldn't offer higher trim levels. Which they'll need to do because the base trim will generate little profit, if any."
2021-06-16 21:29:00,wallstreetbets,Baja? I didn't see Ford there.
2021-06-16 22:11:04,wallstreetbets,"$F closed just above $15, less than $NKLA. That should tell you something about investor sentiment. That debt is a huge burden which most investors understand, even if you don't."
2021-06-16 21:39:46,wallstreetbets,"Are you brain dead.  Different trim levels for different buyers using trucks for different things.  They offer a base, that is aimed for work trucks and fleet vehicles at 40k.  Alot of people want more features, luxury items, different towing capabilities, hence the multiple trims.  It's got more than one audience.  Just like what the best selling truck has been doing for 40 years"
2021-06-16 21:41:11,wallstreetbets,Why wouldn't they offer higher trims. I didn't say they were only targeting fleet vehicles.  Only a fuckin idiot would build a pickup truck for one segment of the market and ignore the rest.
2021-06-16 21:37:33,wallstreetbets,Didn't see that lordstown turd do much there.  40 miles before it was dead.
2021-06-17 01:06:29,wallstreetbets,"All F needs to do is bring 5% of potential F150 customers into the fold to sell 50k Lightnings a year.  You can judge ""investor"" sentiment by the 25% share price increase since the debut. Obviously it was very well received. Between its well known looks, ease of purchase,  maintenance, and low costs. There is zero objective reason. Not to assume it will be the #1 selling electric truck. Just like the gas version."
2021-06-16 22:01:29,wallstreetbets,"Right, but base models don't generate enough profit to service Ford's growing 100bil of debt. So no, they won't sequence many on the production line. I think you're forgetting that Ford must build ICE and E trucks simultaneously, until E trucks become the bread winner. And that is a conundrum LMC won't face."
2021-06-16 22:04:40,wallstreetbets,I'm trying to tell you that those trucks generate little profit and won't be widely available. Just like with the work style ICE trucks. They're a talking point and not much more.
2021-06-16 21:48:54,wallstreetbets,"It was there tho, and wasn't just a mirage like Ford's Lightning."
2021-06-17 02:15:21,wallstreetbets,"That's not unreasonable and there is a lot to like. But my GM stock has almost doubled this year because of their stronger balance sheet and investor sentiment. As I've said, I own shares of both and expect them both to succeed in some capacity."
2021-06-16 22:26:21,wallstreetbets,"A. They do make a profit on those vehicles and they sell a ton of f150 work trucks and have for decades.

B. You don't understand Ford's debts.  90% of that debt is Ford credit financing.  Since they finance so many of their vehicle sales themselves it's shown as debt because they haven't been fully paid yet for those vehicles.

C. For has 280 billion in assets 

D. Over 3 billion in Net profits for the last 12 months.

E. They are building both because people want both, not because one isn't profitable. Why limit your market when you don't have to.

F . People use these trucks in ways that are not practical for an EV, any EV,  towing my boat or snowmobiles into the Northwoods where there is no charging infrastructure is not practical so I won't buy an EV truck.  My wife that drives 99% in a 150 mile radius does have an EV because it is practical for how she uses a vehicle.  People have different needs and use vehicles in different ways.  As long as there is a market for it both will be made.

G. Lordstown will never be marketable to people who tow anything into less developed parts of the country.  When towing with an EV the range gets crushed, it's just a reality of physics.  No one wants to stop every hour and a half to charge for an hour when towing their toys around and in many parts of the nation there is no ability to.   So they have a much smaller market that is going to be full of competition from better companies."
2021-06-17 00:50:13,wallstreetbets,"Those are all very good points. But all I'm really trying to say here is that this is a new frontier for GM & Ford too. All their past success with ICE trucks doesn't give them an automatic ticket to the same market share for E trucks. There is still a lot that remains to be seen. 

LMC is starting out in a niche part of the market where profit margins aren't as high. And their overhead is also much lower. But they have their own set of problems and tough road ahead to any success."

For those unaware, [$WKHS has a 10% stake in $RIDE](https://chargedevs.com/features/retooling-a-shuttered-factory-to-build-electric-trucks-qa-with-lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns/), so $WKHS will benefit greatly as $RIDE climbs. Additionally, if $WKHS were to get a [piece of the USPS contract to build their delivery vehicles](https://www.theverge.com/22423179/usps-mail-trucks-electric-oshkosh), the trucks would be built at $RIDE’s facility, so both stocks would continue to jump. My preference of the two is $RIDE, as it gives you backdoor exposure to $WKHS through their 10% stake. I also believe $RIDE has many more short-term catalysts.
 
After all, on Tuesday 6/15, the $RIDE President (who was a former Tesla executive) said $RIDE is willing and able to build Postal Vehicles (in conjunction with $WKHS). $RIDE is also rumored to be talking to other Tesla executives as potential CEO candidates.
 
[$RIDE’s short % of float is ~32%](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RIDE/short-interest/), and I have seen other sources that claim it is as high as 35%. I have not seen a company with more upcoming catalysts than $RIDE with this high of a short interest. I’ve noticed a huge jump in OI for 7/16 $20 calls and many other calls expiring on 7/16. 🚀 🚀 🚀
 
$RIDE also has billions in assets, around $500m in cash, and 0 debt. They are currently in talks with strategic investors and the Dept of Energy ATVM loan program (same loan that Tesla got as a start-up) to obtain more cash and ramp up commercial production. In their current cash state, they can begin production and produce ~ 20,000 vehicles by next May, but a loan or strategic investor would accelerate/increase commercial production.
 
 
**RIDE – Overview, Tech, and Batteries**
 
RIDE is currently ramping up for mass-production of their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). With the backing of GM along with their automotive plant, RIDE believes their [facility will be able to produce up to 600,000 vehicles each year](https://www.carscoops.com/2020/05/lordstown-motors-ceo-thinks-ev-startup-can-build-600000-vehicles-a-year/) at max capacity. They have the 3rd largest automotive factory in the US which is vertically integrated with robots welding vehicles and will soon have the 2nd largest battery assembly plant in the US.
 
Additionally, RIDE signed a [multi-year supplier agreement with LG Energy Solution](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/03/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-will-use-tesla-batteries-from-lg/#:~:text=Lordstown%20Motors%20Electric%20Pickup%20Will%20Use%20%E2%80%9CTesla%20Batteries%E2%80%9D%20From%20LG&text=Lordstown%20Motors%27%20CEO%20Steve%20Burns,Model%203%20and%20Model%20Y.), “a global leader in battery cell technology, to broaden their high-quality, diverse battery cell supply chain.” It’s also worth noting that [GM and LG are building a battery plant less than a mile away from RIDE’s facility](https://businessjournaldaily.com/gm-lg-chem-select-lordstown-site-for-plant/), which will help them with any supply chain bottlenecks from a battery perspective.

 
**Growth Potential for RIDE 🚀 🚀 🚀**
 
The simplistic approach RIDE took with their [skateboard chassis](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1130616_lordstown-thrashes-the-skateboard-for-its-endurance-electric-truck-in-wheel-motors-and-all) will allow them to create several vehicles using the same skateboard, including their Endurance truck, an ERV, an SUV, Postal Vehicles, etc. 

RIDE also announced an [agreement with Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/news/holman-enterprises-lordstown-motors-announce-co-marketing-agreement-and-expanded-alliance/) – a leader in the fleet industry that currently has over 2 million vehicles under management. In addition, RIDE mentioned they have seen interest from government and military fleets, and they [received a GSA listing to be able to sell to those entities](https://www.fleetforward.com/10135588/lordstown-motors-gains-gsa-listing).
 
Looking at the current demand, a 6/15 interview from $RIDE’s management confirmed that they have enough binding orders to fill 2021/2022 production targets.

  
**Competitive Landscape: Electric Truck Startups**

RIDE often draws comparisons to two other EV startups, Rivian and Nikola ($NKLA). Nikola is pre-revenue and seems to be much further out from mass-production, yet still has a $7B market cap. Amazon-backed Rivian is the clear leader in terms of EV startups and are likely to be [valued at or above $70B](https://insideevs.com/news/511272/rivian-seek-70billion-ipo-underwriters/) this fall when they IPO.
It is worth noting that RIDE’s replacement value for their facility is ~ $3B and they have [over $400m cash on hand](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020). When looking at the monster valuations of competitors relative to RIDE’s current $1.7B market cap, it just goes to show that other EV companies in general seem to be trading at significantly higher multiples than RIDE. In fact, most trade at more than 5x future revenue.

In RIDE’s March earnings call, they announced their plans to re-tool their facility with additional funding to be able to produce 60,000 vehicles in 2022 in response to increased customer interest for their Endurance truck. Selling 60,000 vehicles would result in over $3B in revenue, which, with a 5x multiple, would lead to a market cap of over $15B for RIDE ( ~$100/share).


**Conclusion**
 
The EV market is flooded with competition, but RIDE is taking a unique approach in their business model by targeting commercial fleets. They also have one of the most productive automotive facilities in the whole United States, which bodes well for the “Buy American” initiative that the current administration has been echoing in the past several months.
Sure, there are risks investing in any startup, but RIDE presents a very nice risk/reward setup at current levels.
Short-sellers and lawsuits have caused the stock to lose ~ 60% of its value from all-time highs. With a current valuation of only $1.7B, when RIDE is mass producing their commercial fleet pick-ups in 3 months, the only problem investors will have is that they didn’t buy more. 🚀 🚀 🚀
 
TLDR;
Over 31% of RIDE’s float is short, and they are now just 3 months away from mass production with an automotive facility capable of producing ~ 600,000 vehicles each year.
RIDE has several catalysts in the short term; [“Lordstown Week” from June 21-25](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230535/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-To-Host-Investors-Analysts-Customers-and-Partners-At-Lordstown-Week-Next-Month.html), the [ATVM loan](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) (the government loan that Tesla got to jumpstart their production), and current talks with GM for additional investment.

2021-06-17 09:32:03,wallstreetbets,"As an avid EV enthusiast, my opinion is that of all the EV startups out there, Lordstown and Workhorse are the LEAST likely to succeed. 

Rivian will be the first to market with electric pickup trucks this year, and also has a huge order from Amazon to build a fleet of electric delivery vans. Arcimoto (FUV) has a unique 3-wheel EV design which is already in production, and will only get cheaper over time. They also have a delivery truck version. Arrival (ARVL) has a unique microfactory concept to allow for small-scale highly automated factories, and have functional beta prototypes for their UPS delivery vans and buses. Lucid (CCIV) will be delivering their luxury sedan this summer. Those are far more likely to succeed in the long run than Workhorse and Lordstown."
2021-06-16 23:39:27,wallstreetbets,You really should read up on what each EV company is doing. Or not doing. Some have functional prototypes that are already seen and reviewed by journalists. Some have vehicles designs or production methods that set them apart from legacy auto makers. Some have already started production. And some have none of these.
2021-06-17 04:21:09,wallstreetbets,Last time I hear their prototype blown up and they dont have the net worth to produce vehicles

Pump and dump at best. WKHS has some potential, but they need contracts and have clearly had a ready to roll work truck for several years and for whatever reason that even isn't in the market.

People don't even know what the word ""tooling"" refers to in this sector. I'd bet money most of the $RIDE investors on this sub don't have a single clue how insanely steep the hill is to building a production vehicle. 

Look at factory five. A company that's regarded as one of the best kit car makers on Earth and they've been producing them for fucking ever and they are still shoddy as fuck and struggle with proper body alignment. 

Mass producing a vehicle that can reliably operate in climates from a hot as sin death valley California to cold as balls mid January Alaska and won't fall apart after even 50,000 miles is NOT easy.

Hell, my wife's Mazda 6 had a recall service because the ENTIRE SUBFRAME on the front was prone to completely rusting away. Like, how the fuck, MAZDA?! 

People in general don't appreciate all of the work that goes into making them but this sub hyping up borderline vaporware companies as if it's easy to go from prototype to production is HILARIOUSLY ignorant."

I drive around 35k miles a year.  So that service relationship is much more important to me. Than say someone who needs a couple oil changes and an inspection yearly as their only service needs.

The thrill of hitting the wheel of fortune 100 times and seeing how many jackpots I could land. It was priceless fun every time I and many others here have had. 

Without doing any research some would maybe see this as a dying business, but this is simply not the case. Last week $PLAY release earnings and absolutely crushed expectations, beating expected EPS by 350%. Some other notable highlights in the earnings report include:

1. Revenues totaled $265.3 million compared with $159.8 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $363.6 million in the first quarter of 2019
2. Net income totaled $19.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $43.5 million, or $1.37 per share in the first quarter of 2020 and net income of $42.4 million, or $1.13 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019
3. EBITDA totaled $72.1 million, or 27.2% of revenues, compared with EBITDA loss of $26.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 and EBITDA of $88.9 million, or 24.4% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2019
4. Store-level operating income before depreciation and amortization was positive in 119 stores during the quarter and in 127 stores for the final month ended May 2, 2021
5. Generated $77 million in operating cash flow and used $60 million to completely pay down revolving credit facility. Ended the quarter with $20 million in cash and approximately $340 million of liquidity available under the Company’s revolving credit facility, net of a $150 million minimum liquidity covenant and $10 million in letters of credit.

The debt of this company is callable by November of next year, 2022. These highlights all show that this is still a fundamentally sound business, but they also have plans for improvement. The company is currently seeking opportunities to incorporate SPORTS BETTING in its business model. 

“We also continue to make progress in our discussions with potential sports betting partners and look forward to concluding negotiations later this year.”

To add to all this almost a quarter (21%) of the float is **\*\*SOLD SHORT\*\***. It’s crazy some people think this company is dying like they though GME and AMC, but this company is even more fundamentally sound than either of those two, and looking into strategic planning to enhance business operations.

The chart is beginning to get VERY tight in its wedge. With strong support at $40, and resistances at $48 and $51. If we break these key resistance levels, my god... This is a 48 million share float which will absolutely erupt if these resistance levels are broken. If this hit CLOV's peak market cap, you are looking at a $150-200+ stock. Currently, options IV are sitting incredibly low for the time being that this is such a steal.

2021-06-16 20:58:49,wallstreetbets,Very curious to see how ITUB plays out. Very cheap with low-cost options. The amount of calls placed for July and August is insane. I wonder if the buying pressure will be enough to actually trigger some price movement

2021-06-17 06:40:34,wallstreetbets,"i personally have bought yesterday and the day before, the day before that and will today as well.
 both calls and stocks

my price target is a new ATH within a few weeks and long term (2y, without any squeeze happening) between 2000 - 3500.

So I fully expect at least a 10 bagger without any squeeze happening. purely on financials improving, mainstream adoption, fomo-ers buying in and etfs rebalancing.


zoom out to the 4h or daily or weekly and see the best shaped cup and handle pattern ever. 

Read about wyckoff institutional buying cycles, that lead to such patterns, and realise that even 3000 by the end of the year (without any squeeze) is not of the card.


When the squeeze happens, the numbers on /r/superstock like 20 or 30 million are also possible."

Keep an eye on the markets. try not to fomo into anything that’s popping. Just watch the numbers. 

I know it feels like when a stock runs up 200% and you missed out, it’ll be your last chance ever. 

But that shit happens all the time, if you stay around long enough you’re bound to bag a good one on time. 

Time in the market fam. Just be patient and do your research. Idc what kind of research that is. Fundamentals, technical, looking at WSB DD’s, whatever it is, just be confident about it, don’t half ass it.

ASO -  the powers that be are keeping this under $40 for Friday. This will be $50+ soon. Buy the dip.
I’ve shares and July and Dec calls (added to yesterday)

PRPL - never bet against the king. The mattress king said it will go up and that’s good enough for me. She will be back over $30 soon and $35+ EOY
I’ve shares and Jan calls (new position yesterday)

BCRX - this will be a long term winner if you can go 12 rounds. Get in before earnings in Aug with Jan 23 calls. Trading at $16 now but should be $50+ EOY 2022. That’s 3X on shares or more with options. $17/$20’s are good plays.

Started the day with 40x 6/18 SPY 423p's. Sold them for +20% initial amount right before FOMC minutes because it seemed like the market did not want to turn off risk. They couldve easily gone for over +100-150%. So missed out on like 8-10k.

Bought 45x 6/30 424c because JPOW basically said ""nothings changed"" and the removal of Fed uncertainty along with keeping the foot on the gas seemed bullish. Obviously open gonna hurt."

2021-06-16 22:17:05,wallstreetbets,"For anyone throwing themselves into stocks because they see it mentioned here or read a DD, you can find out where a price is heading by looking at the charts. The best indicator I've used, often to the penny, is Standard Deviation Channels on Think or Swim.

TOS is free if you don't use it. But it's the only one with accurate channels. It's as if the algos use the same exact formula that it's uncanny.

There are tutorials on YouTube how to use it with two time periods: daily and four hour charts.

Once you see where a price is heading and a retard tells you it's going up, you'll know what to do.

This won't work for long-term meme stocks that reach legendary status, though. And remember, simply because because a meme stock is mentioned, doesn't mean it's legendary. Treat them all like regular stocks until you know better."

MACD histogram is growing positive.  Williams%R momentum indicator is still very positive.     ADX is suggesting uptrend with DMI+ > DMI-.  The ADX confirms its about to pop out of a trading range into a trend and the DMI+ spreading above the DMI- means up not down trend.  RSI (relative strength index) is 62.06.  Looks like an ABCD pattern is forming off the bottom and the accumulation phase is almost over, so the next leg is up.

2021-06-16 20:05:39,wallstreetbets,"Since it's being pushed:

ITUB is a Brazilian bank, with all the political and exchange rate risk that entails.

ITUB 04/08/2006: $6.58 USD. This is, coincidentally, about the price of two Big Macs ($3.30 USD each) at the time.

ITUB 06/16/2021: $6.54 USD. Adjusted for inflation, $4.90 USD.

Cost of ONE Big Mac in the United States in January 2021 (average): $5.66.

Conclusion: Buying and holding two Big Macs at $6.60 in 2006 would be worth $11.32 in Big Macs today, compared to one share of ITUB going from $6.58 to $6.54."

If you’re on this sub purely for meme stocks you’re retarded. Even if you’re buying shares, you’re retarded for being on this sub. If everyone is already talking about a stock, you missed it. Plain and simple. Get in on something that has promise while no is talking about it. 

During the Texas blackouts from the winter storm ET made billions in profit. And guess what? Texas is having blackouts again. ET used their profits from the Texas winter storm to pay off debt, and now they’re gonna rake in more cash from ERCOT being the most retarded energy company in America.

2021-06-17 04:17:20,wallstreetbets,"I have 600k in assets and a good paying job. There just isn’t much to do with the money once you have a house, car, live in a nice area and have zero debt. You can travel and don’t have to worry about bills which are very nice and aren’t a convenience I understand that many have so I know I’m very fortunate. At the same time any luxuries I want to enjoy in my life that go beyond the upper middle class would require me to add a 0 to my asset and cash value so there’s a weird limbo area you can get stuck in IE middle class where you don’t really get to do much other than have security with cash. At this point in life you’re just doing affordable hobbies and stashing cash away every paycheck. Just keeps growing with nothing really to spend it on. A boat will wreck your savings, can’t afford a yacht, can’t afford private jets. Adding shit to your house doesn’t help necessarily because in my case is just my wife and I we wouldn’t use it. So we just stash stash stash. I have a newer car already and no debt or car payment. I’ve got nothing to really splurge on that intrigues me. So life is pretty boring tbh

The most exciting thing I do is trade and research, max my 401k, and gaming sometimes. Most of my life at this point is self discovery. I’ve learned I’m a purpose driven person. Acquiring more money is my current purpose in life, but once I have it I’m not rushing out to spend it. I just want to feel the rush of succeeding."

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UPDATE: The Official Pride Month Gay Bear Thesis - We're here, we're queer, get used to it. Last week I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nw17ne/in_honor_of_pride_month_a_bold_gay_bear_dd) outlining a very gay bear thesis and called a 10%+ correction. The FOMC meeting and data that was released today confirms this expectation. As the week continues, we will see the losses accelerate as volume picks up. As I’m writing this I’m watching a bounce from intraday lows. This bounce is fake. Let’s talk what the Fed did or didn’t do, why it’s bad, and what will fuel the correction through the second half of June.

**The Fed did not announce a plan to taper asset purchases.**

As I talked about in my previous post, the Fed was between a rock and a hard place going into this meeting. On the one hand, announcing tapering of treasury purchases was thought to run the risk of inducing a “taper tantrum” as liquidity was removed from the market. On the other hand, leaving Fed policy unchanged ran the risk of further increasing inflation expectations and drawing out [bond vigilantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_vigilante) who sell bonds to protest inflationary fed policy and cause yields to spike. By leaving policy unchanged and announcing no immediate plans to slow asset purchases, I would argue that the Fed chose the greater of two evils in this scenario. The lack of policy change should indicate to investors that A. The Fed does not see the recovery going as well as they did previously and B. that the risk of inflation and losing control of inflation continues to grow. In certain highly important parts of the economy such as [oil](https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-inventories-fell-by-85m-barrels-last-week-api-2533142) and [housing](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/an-inflation-storm-is-coming-for-the-u-s-housing-market-11623419869), inflation is hitting hard and looks to have some staying power. I also saw a McDonalds near me hiring at a starting wage of $14 per hour. This is anecdotal, but wage gains are not fucking transitory. The Fed also [raised its inflation expectations,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/06/16/fed-powell-inflation-unemployment-june-meeting/) which will further drive algorithmic selling of treasuries.

**Short term volume driving downward momentum**

Today was a high-volume day and the rest of the week should continue to see high volume. The bounce off intraday lows was on low volume buying and we should see continued high-volume selling for a few days. Take a look at RSI before and after the almost complete recovery of the Nasdaq after the initial drop.

&#x200B;

[QQQ RSI did not recover on the monthly chart](https://preview.redd.it/28yt2v7uno571.png?width=419&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc80c2cb7d5840498fd35a0db3f5488c3749366e)

&#x200B;

[Nor the yearly chart](https://preview.redd.it/fcdlv5swno571.png?width=413&format=png&auto=webp&s=10b2448f666bfed14d61956e981567999ba5c50f)

The low volume of the BTD indicates that most investors, namely institutions, are not falling into the bull trap that is being set by algorithms, who buy dips based on arbitrary daily volume and strength factors. The indexes should fall again tomorrow, if not by the end of the day. I expect we’ll be down at least 3% by the end of the week as the indexes test the 50-day moving averages. I will be bold in predicting a test of the 200-day before this correction is through.

**Bonds disagree with the bounce**

Despite the short-term bounce, the bond market, which I said in my previous post is far larger and more important than the stock market, does not seem to be experiencing a similar rally and looks to be on a the downward move, causing yields to rise. We should see the 10-year yield break back above 1.6% in the near future. Look at RSI for the short-term treasury ETF.

&#x200B;

[Short-term treasuries did not catch a bid coinciding with the intraday bounce](https://preview.redd.it/x58haad0oo571.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a055ca1222dd6b211e30cddec241eec77dc62eaa)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[ 10 year yield stabilized at higher level. Algos will sell on that fact alone. ](https://preview.redd.it/5v9azon1oo571.png?width=388&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9b1c676625aed197ef3449402410b5873d35e8a)

&#x200B;

**Quadruple witch should be pretty spooky**

I will also point out that a [quadruple witching day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_witching_hour) is coming on Friday. During uptrends this is a good thing as institutions reposition and rebalance for the quarter ahead. However, during downtrends it can exasperate an issue. Markets typically perform better in low volume as “melt-ups” occur. Indicating that volatility is low. A quadruple witching hour is the last thing the market needs right now and will drive further downward momentum. I haven’t looked at the data, but based on recent experience with the quadruple witch, the trend set on that day tends to follow through with momentum for a few weeks after.

**Summary/Strategy:** The gay bear thesis is intact. Look for bond yields to reach new YTD highs as this correction takes place and start thinking about buying when the VIX gets back into the 30s (the real VIX, not bullshit VIX future instruments)..

TLDR: I was right last week, the intraday bounce is an obvious trap and a high-volume selloff will cause momentum on the downside, inflation projections are up, yields are stabilizing at higher levels, technicals are currently shit and still overbought coming off relatively high levels where selloff normally occurs, and the treasury selloff is not complete as treasuries were very overbought going into the Fed meeting.

&#x200B;

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WEN DD COMES OUT Okay everyone we're back for WEN Pt. 2. Stick with me here. The logic is going to get pretty big IQ.

Let me remind you of some of the serious DD I did for WEN back in the day.

McDonalds. Wendys. They're basically the same thing right? Right.

Product? Check. Market Cap? Not checked. They don't have the same market cap. Why's that? I don't know. Let's look at their revenue numbers. 

&#x200B;

Mcdonalds Revenue according to google: 21,000,000,000.

Wendys Revenue according to google: 1,400,000,000.

&#x200B;

That means in ape land, Mcdonalds should be exactly 15 times larger than wendys.

How much larger than wendys is it actually?

175.43B/6.25B = 28.

&#x200B;

McDonalds is 28 times larger than Wendys, when in ape land, it should be only 15 times larger. Ridiculous.

&#x200B;

What does this mean for Wendy's?

It means the stock price at a fair ape value should be a minimum, 28/15 times larger than it is now.

That's 1.86 times larger.

&#x200B;

Quantified?

Wendy's stock price has a fair ape value of $44.38.

Although that is the fair ape value, I have a price target of $75. It's a smaller cap stock, it should grow faster than McDonalds, and should return more to investors relative to capital thrown in.

&#x200B;

This is not a joke. This is also not financial advice. Tendies are not a joke. Do not underestimate the power of Wendy Thomas. Yes, the girl's name is Wendy. No, don't look up a photo of her.

**What is ITUB**: It's a really fahking big Brazilian Bank called Itau. Both investment banking (Itau BBA) and retail banking (Itau Unibanco). When you trade ITUB you're trading Itau's stock on the local Brazilian stock market (BVMF: ITUB4). So you're implicitly trading the Brazilian Real against the dollar (USDBRL) as well.  


**Is it a good company?:** It's a really really fahking big bank in BRAZIL. An emerging market full of oligopolies. So yes, it's a good fucking company. They print money.  


**Follow the whales:** A whole lot of option trading activity buying Itub calls (source below) for 16/July strike 7 and strike 8. It's Brazil, so it could easily could be insider trading. Could just be a bullish speculative bet too. Who knows? But with vol that cheap, its super unlikely that someone is holding a large stock position and just wants to capture a cheap ass premium on OTM calls.  


[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o16vzo/itub\_dd\_itub\_to\_the\_moon\_or\_toaster\_in\_the\_tub/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o16vzo/itub_dd_itub_to_the_moon_or_toaster_in_the_tub/)

&#x200B;

**Buying the breakout:** By buying ITUB we're selling USDBRL (selling the dollar and buying the Brazilian Real) and buying ITUB4 on the Brazilian stock exchange.   


ITUB4 is just now running through its 52 week high and is still considered to be cheap by onshore Brazilian analysts. USDBRL is fighting to break through an important level of 5.0000. It went through it today before No Home Jerome Powell came in and fucked that up. But it's still got a nice chance to get through there sometime here soon and make ITUB go up even more because of the exchange rate. So if you look at ITUB itself, it too is breaking out and going through 52 week highs.

&#x200B;

**Comment on USDBRL FX:** Unless you're Stan Fucking Druckenmiller, trading FX is really hard. But there are a lot of arguments to be made that the dollar is overvalued against the Brazilian Real. The Brazilian central bank is raising rates. Commodities are super expensive and going up. Guess what Brazil produces a shit ton of, commodities. So it is very possible that USDBRL is going down (dollar losing value against the Brazilian Real)

&#x200B;

**In conclusion:** Not financial advice, but it sure seems to be a nice risk return to follow the whales and buy these calls. Let's fucking gooooooo  


**TLDR:** Follow the whales and buy the breakout in ITUB/ITUB4 and possible breakout in USDBRL."

2021-06-17 08:33:01,wallstreetbets,"I’ve got an honest question and I promise I’m not trolling you, just curious. 

A trend I’ve noticed is WSB rallying around dogshit companies. First it was GME, a company that WSB hated prior to 2021 because of its shit obsolete business model, the way it treated employees, and screwed customers. Now GME is apparently an amazing company but nothing besides executive leadership has actually changed. 

AMC, same story. Prior to 2021 everyone hated it at $3 a share. And to make matters worse, they 5x their float in 2020-2021. But somehow it’s suddenly a great buy at $50 after 5x dilution. 

Then we have Wish, a company everyone on Reddit (not just WSB) makes fun of because what you order and what you receive are always deceptively different, go the point that ordering stuff on Wish is a meme. But WSB thinks its a great company?

What’s going on? I truly don’t understand. Especially the Wish one, because I’ve seen countless reviews of “wish has this product at a steep discount, too good to be true?” and its always counterfeit. Always. Seems like an awful store for customers and customer retention. Why is it a good stock to own?"
2021-06-17 12:02:03,wallstreetbets,I've mostly ordered clothing and accessories from wish. I've gotten what I ordered sometimes a bit more or it's been a bit different than in the picture. Anyway it's dirt cheap so that comes with the price I guess. I wouldn't buy more advanced electronics  there but it's fun to just go on a buy some silly things for the cost of almost nothing. I haven't read a lot of other people's reviews either so idk about others experiences especially recently. The few I have read for things I was interested in were good so that's why I purchased them because they seemed to have a lot of solid reviews backing up what you actually get.

I couldn't resist the urge to buy back in on this dip on PRPL- the company has over 100M in cash on hand and is trading at \~1.8x this years projected sales. Consensus price target is in the high 30's. I expect Brian Nagel will reiterate a by rating sometime this month. God speed Handi-capables.

&#x200B;

For those wondering why I have two brokerages, I use fidelity for retirement accounts and IBKR for my margin/cash account.

For old DD

&#x200B;

Just a matter of time before this goes back on it's way up. PRPL for the win. Also, I have been wrong more than I have been right, so do your own DD. God speed. I previously said I wouldn't post any DD unless things had changed. This price action is a great opportunity in my eyes. I have been loading the boat. I am only shorting puts, buying shares and buying leaps.

Like mentioned, invest safe: **analyze the DD and make your own judgment before investing**. **Do not FOMO or follow the herd blindly\***

**\*\*EDIT #2: Looks like the subreddit could be having bots awarding DDs. Don't invest for a quick buck trying to chase hype. Minimize you risk.  Dont buy options unless you are ready to lose the money. I still have all my positions. YOU SHOULDNT invest in this if you are trying to catch hype. This is only my opinion and information.**

# 1. Intro

Some of you may already be familiar with the [part 1 of my DD done on Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzbdz8/lev_lion_electric_the_new_king_of_the_jungle/). If you aren't I invite you to take a look to learn about the company.

Stock price has fallen since my DD. I did add more to my position yesterday, now with $40K+ in warrants. I believe that it's an irrational selloff and that we will continue our journey to the top.

There has been an **investor's presentation update** and some news in QC, so I'm making a second DD with all the missing info.

&#x200B;

**Little background:**

I'm from Quebec, Canada. I have invested in Lion since December when the merger was announced and have been following ever single detail + news on this company. I did not sell on the pump to 35$ because I think that 50$ PT is not out of reach in a year. Sadly the market died and took down LEV with it as well for now. But good stocks will bounce back, LEV will bounce hard.

**I've visited the manufacturing site in Quebec (exclusive picture proof):**

https://preview.redd.it/f30bxk024o571.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=d950ae8d6ca392e90225e8706b1c04f5f470d216

I also see LionC buses in Quebec very often now. It's like seeing the first few Teslas on the road.

We are still early in the adoption of the buses but it's only a matter of time before they all become EV (see part 4)

**Again, personal pic taken:**

https://preview.redd.it/1mxwadey3o571.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=e73a3254c3204b76f7e8245f43f1fd6c287ecb99

# 

# 2. Potential in the short term

**ARVL started running yesterday** on the news that it's being **shorted with about 20% of the float** and a **big cost to borrow shares (about 130-270%, although Etrade says 120%**). This is indeed a huge borrow rate and a good short interest for such small cap and float company.

Well, as mentioned already on Sunday:

**Lion is also shorted for 20%+ of the Float** with a cost to borrow **also around the 130% mark** according to ORTEX and my broker.

https://preview.redd.it/uwpqpv7x3o571.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=12b3b076a58ff00ce45aca29882ab89d6739eb66

**Short volume has also been 30-65%** in the past few days

https://preview.redd.it/udzwxxwxdo571.png?width=1535&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4f2f18e95c6e811d76007fa838f523739160152

**I'm giving you this info but I'm not here for the short interest play. All this indicates is that the price is heavily forced down because the company is being put in the same batch of the SPAC EV disaster. Current share holders are in for the long run, shares are hard to borrow because of that. Any good catalyst could make this stock fly because of that.**

# 3. Valuation: My Golden Goose

**LEV is currently sitting at about 3.4B market cap**. Lets compare this to other EV startups:

**ARVL: 13B** market cap

* No revenues until 2022, still working on their prototypes for the UPS contract.
* Good company and niche technology but valued at **almost 4x LEV** with a lot of risk ahead (their revenue projections for 2024 are insane and most likely not sustainable)

**NKLA: 6.2B** market cap

* Almost **2x higher than Lion** (LEV would be 33$ for the same Market cap)
* Company was a big scam led by Trevor Milton who had to resign
* Still trying to work on their prototypes

**RIDE: 1.8B** market cap

* Recently announced that they lack the funds to continue their project
* Orderbook might have been fake
* [CEO and CFO resigned on these news](https://www.streetinsider.com/Board+Changes/Lordstown+Motors+%28RIDE%29+CEO+and+CFO+Resign/18553949.html).
* Again, seems like it will either be a failure or very big dilution ahead to get the $$$

**CANO: 2.3B**

* Merger hits and the company announces that they lost their Hyundai partnership
* Redesigned their hole company and now being [under investigation by SEC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-17/electric-vehicle-startup-canoo-s-ceo-discloses-sec-investigation)

**RMO: 1.1B**

* An other scam by management, once merger was done, they cut their 2021 guidance from 140M to 18-40M (LOL)
* [Currently being sued for the con](https://ca.movies.yahoo.com/rmo-investor-deadline-tomorrow-hagens-133500662.html)

**Most EV SPACs were a scam or failure. Lion is the the Golden Goose that has been announcing deals after deals (IKEA, AMAZON, USA + QC Schools, Pride...) and continuing growth.**

**Amazon has the possibility to gain 15.8% ownership of the company. They currently can exercise 2.7% of it according to the last SEC form filed by lion.**

# 4. The New Favorite Child of Quebec

Quebec announced a few months ago that they are [injecting $250M to electrify 2600 school buses in the next 3 years](https://globalnews.ca/news/7784257/quebec-electric-school-buses-2030/), with a long term goal of reaching 65% in 2030 and 100% in 2035 (10 000 buses)

More specifically they are looking at **800 buses in 2021** (this year), **1013 buses in 2022** and **779 buses in 2023** for now. ([French link)](https://www.lapresse.ca/affaires/2021-04-23/quebec-veut-electrifier-les-autobus-scolaires.php)

Here is the fun part for investors; Lion is the only ""Made in Canada"" EV bus manufacturer, hence they will be **getting almost 80% of the sales.**

The other bus companies are currently boiling and calling this a ""**Monopoly created for Lion**"".

In August, the purchase of EV Buses must start and Lion is being spoon fed by the government who stated that [they will not change the policies of the deal.](https://www.journaldequebec.com/2021/06/15/drummondville-deplore-le-monopole-au-benefice-de-lion?fbclid=IwAR3V5j1HnGS_qa2_saGn3paOHhZO4AxnJLDviofoB93FJtv0_NpLRVPEIK8)

Remember when I said today is like the early Tesla stages where you see 1 or 2 cars on the street?  With new policies its only a matter of time that this changes.

# 5. The right place at the right time

Policies are changing, and they are changing fast. **TAM of $110B**

EV buses and trucks are going to be the norm and LEV is perfectly placed, **ready to take orders and deliver their products.**

Cali is allowing the **accumulation of credits in 2021** (free revenue once gain)

Here are a few policies mentioned in the new investor's program:

**Analysts have the same opinion on the matter:**

Currently Lion has **650 employees** and growing exponentially.

**They are now recruiting 100 NIGHT SHIFT employees** = this is the ultimate sign that they need to keep up with skyrocketing demands.

https://preview.redd.it/um0do65u0o571.png?width=401&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d92b1e0e6edd204f97d786c6a1c772b243ebea2

**Risks and downsides:**

* Scaling is the biggest risk imo, we never know what will happen down the line when a new company ramps up to the production of 20 000+ vehicles
* Deals falling through with big businesses (amazon, ikea, etc)
* Market crash as a whole with rising inflation and what not

**TLDR**:

* The **Golden Goose of the EV companies** (Ex: can get to 30$ before being valued like NKLA)
* Real leader in the industry in a hot EV market
* Supported by Canadian and USA government with funds and tax abatement
* Skyrocketing demand and growth
* Total Addressable market **(TAM):  $110B**
* Key customers (Amazon, IKEA, Pride, CN...): possibility for Amazon to but 2500+ trucks (big catalyst if it does happen)
* About 20% of float shorted with high cost to borrow (\~130%)

&#x200B;

**Play ideas:**

* **I recommend being safe with shares**
* If you want options look for **October contracts (20C):** I think this is the best time to profit from all the catalysts and orders to come
* Risky play: July calls can print if there's a quick bounce and shorts needing to cover

**Disclaimer**: Not financial advise, I'm just sharing with you what I know about a company that I believe will be a gamechanger in the industry.

Positions; 8400 warrants  + 20C for July

**\*\*EDIT\*\*:** I have no clue how this already got so many awards. Like mentioned, invest safe: **analyze the DD and make your own judgment before investing**. **Do not FOMO or follow the herd blindly\***

**\*\*EDIT #2: Looks like the subreddit could be having bots awarding DDs. Don't invest for a quick buck trying to chase hype. Minimize you risk.  Dont buy options unless you are ready to lose the money. I still have all my positions. YOU SHOULDNT invest in this if you are trying to catch hype. This is only my opinion and information.**

Just to add Canoo's ticker is GOEV not whatever this OP wrote. And it has been speculated that they walked away from hyundai deal due to not wanting their IP taken. They switched their business model to also allow purchase of vehicles not just subscriptions which again imo seems quite smart.

2021-06-16 20:39:19,wallstreetbets,I dunno what you were expecting. Inflation is running hot because production got choked this last year and demand is ramping up. This while business in a lot of sectors is still not back in full swing and unemployment remains high. Provide an alternative instead of a tired cynical clown meme and maybe you won’t get so many ??s in your sub.
2021-06-16 23:43:08,wallstreetbets,"except stimulus is having to get more and more intense by the day. This started in 08 with one single package... now the fed is buying 120 billion per month with no way to go back to ""normal"" that was before 2008. They have been trying to return to their pre 2008 ways but haven't been able. The fed is pressed up against a corner, doing the only thing it knows and hoping for the best. They haven't raised the rates because they can't do it without grave consequences."
2021-06-17 07:32:30,wallstreetbets,"There's definitely inflation when you go to the store to buy groceries and everything is packaged in smaller amounts while still being more expensive than a larger quantity was 5-10 years ago.

At that point it's not just huge corporations being greedy, it's inflation.  Their operational costs rose, and considering how it wasn't from having to pay their employees more ($7.25 minimum wage for-fucking-ever apparently), it means inflation.

You can't just pass off the rising costs of *literally everything* as some kind of non-inflationary phenomenon.  It looks like inflation, it sounds like inflation, and everyone knows it's inflation."
2021-06-16 23:47:41,wallstreetbets,"solution: let the crash happen, let assets correct, let people get fucked, let companies get fucked, gut government spending, start a debt repayment plan (while defaulting on some of it) , stick to a 1% m2 expansion per year max limit... this will painfully unwind decades of mischeif and eventually restore a more balanced and health economy without massive asset bubbles."

Its not the end but maybe the people will learn the lesson about fiscal responsibility and you will wipe the slate clean of the govt leaches (temporarily). Just hope you are not about to retire because you will need some extra years after the reset to unfuck yourselves. Whatever is left behind will be a good investment stock wise."

[explanation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp)"
2021-06-17 06:18:16,wallstreetbets,"Basically I have invested in the price difference between inflation protected bonds (TIPS) and regular bonds. The premium of the TIPS is how much the market is willing to pay extra for inflation protection. 

If the market works this should reflect how much inflation is expected."
2021-06-16 23:07:03,wallstreetbets,"Because TIPS are based on the CPI measured inflation, which is always lower than real inflation. For example, if real inflation this year is 5%, the government may play games with the CPI to make it appear like inflation was actually 3.5%. Furthermore, the CPI has a limited scope, so even without shenanigans it doesn't measure inflation in a lot of industries and categories, resulting in artificially low recorded inflation. Now your TIPS is worth less than it was when you bought it. Everyone knows this is what's happening, which is why TIPS got the dips. Actual inflationary hedges are property, which is why you see large investment firms buying real estate lately, among other physical assets."
2021-06-17 06:23:16,wallstreetbets,Exactly. If the market comes to the same conclusion the TIPS spread should go up. At least that’s what I am betting on.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to set the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 0.15 percent, effective June 17, 2021. Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 15 basis points above the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the Federal Open Market Committee's target range and to support the smooth functioning of short-term funding markets.

As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:
""Effective June 17, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:

* Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent.
* Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities by $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by $40 billion per month.
* Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.
* Conduct repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets.
* Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $80 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.
* Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.
* Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.
* Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions.""
In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent.

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.

Besides FTDs, is there a certain pattern or reason that could explain this? It's just that I have been meaning to $YOLO and I think this one might be the one for me. I'll DM the ticker if anyone wants to see what I'm talking about. Thonks.

Blackberry has a little more going for them with ev as well though.  Bb never deserved to be labeled a meme stock to be honest.  It definitely didnt deserve to be dragged into the whole gme and dozen other stocks halted.  Hedge funds saw an opportunity to take advantage of retail because they knew how much wsb loved bb even before gme came along.  Even though there are still many people holding bb, they know they can shake paper hands or anyone who is impatient and wants to jump ship to another meme stock.

**Ebix cash is a financial services company that  pioneered the idea of digital cash to the Indian consumer, handling $18 billion in tramsactions a year and generating $232,552,000 In revenue last quarter.**

 * They combine over 300,000 physical distribution outlets with their digital backend, making them India's largest end-to-end financial exchange today, conducting in excess of $18 Billion in gross merchandise value.

 * They offer prepaid cards and money transfers. Remittences alone account for 2.9% of India's total GDP with immigrants sending money back home to their relatives,[and it doesn't help indians have the highest median household income of any ethnic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income#Asian_Americans). Their remittences business handles $6.5 billion in tramsactions a year, 70% of India's remittences business.

 * 32 banks use their technology, asset, and wealth management making them leaders in India, The Philippines, Marutius and other regions.

* Their travel portfolio is one of Southeast Asia's largest with over 200,000 agents, 25 branches, and 10,000 corporate clients. This let's customers book flights, busses, cabs and hotels all online.

*Lastly they offer a service that lets people see a doctor online, 24/7.  


**EBIX SaaS**

* Ebix powers multiple exchanges across the world in the field of life,health and property & casualty insurance while conducting in excess of $100 billion in insurance premiums annually on its platforms. [They do so much with the insurance industry I can't reasonably explain everything there](https://www.ebix.com/company). 

 * They make CRM software, claims processing, enterprise software, research and quoting, loss and risk analysis. I'm not going to comment on this is much because it's a much smaller part of their business, and frankly don't know enough about health insurance to comment on this as much as their financial services. I'd rather look like I'm a retard than a bullshitter.

I honestly don't get why they are shorted so much, according to their financial results, their operating income did decline 9% yoy and yoy gaap income decreased 13% yoy, however that was due to the pandemic, and does not reflect their core fundamentals. Excluding revenues from the foreign exchange, travel, e-learning and remittance businesses that were impacted the most by COVID-19, Q1 2021 revenues grew 187% as compared to Q1 2020.They have over $130 million in cash which is almost enough to cover *all* of their $139 million SG&A expenses last year.

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Weekly DD - DraftKings (DKNG) DD - The ""King"" of Online Sports Betting One lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is… Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird’s eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people’s money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here’s a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

https://preview.redd.it/6confoqotn571.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f43a43f9fb483e944baf0cd4fbc9e1e8c7c84f6

&#x200B;

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1) Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.

2) The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.

\- Revenue growth during the first quarter of 2021 came in at 51%, EPS grew by 117%, while its stock price decreased by 49% since March 2021.

\- Seeking alpha think it may be an optimal time to buy, taking advantage of the latest price drop and given the positive business outlook. (link here: Article from May 30th, 21)

\- The board of directors of VIPS authorized a buyback program under which the company may repurchase at its discretion up to $500 million of its shares over two years. This program which will be funded via cash on hand may result in a faster increase in stock price over the medium term.

\- Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the e-commerce industry has witnessed exponential growth in its activity, backed by a faster shift in consumer behavior and increasing online shopping activity. Asian e-commerce players benefited from this new accelerated trend, and VIPS was among those companies.

\- Soros also bought VIPShop stocks along with Viacom. (link here: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/george-soros-scoops-up-archegos-tied-stocks-51621266755](https://www.barrons.com/articles/george-soros-scoops-up-archegos-tied-stocks-51621266755))

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

EXTREMELY LOW FLOAT. The float on this is around 8 million shares, which is even half of VZIO. And for you AMC and GME retards, Vizio’s float is only 4% of AMC’s and less than half of GME’s. If you’re still confused let me say it this way EVERYONE HERE would have to FIGHT for even 1 share.

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$GOGO DD: I researched 50 stocks using the SMELL system and decided to become a GOGO dancer &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h84ta1oplo571.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c1980f8f8faafe65133f1860599f34500394002

So, like the fucking title says, I researched 50 stocks over the past two days using the SMELL system invented by my new messiah /u/pennyether. If a stock has a 1bn+ market cap and 20%+ short interest, I've got an opinion on it now. I disregarded tickers that are already popular because I wanted something I had never heard of before. Enter $GOGO.

# TL;DR:

* [Passes the SMELL test.](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/)
* 3 straight earnings beats.
* Undervalued based on ORTEX data.
* 31% short interest.
* IV is as low as it gets for this stock, 4th percentile.
* Will be back to at least $15 before EOY.
* Stocks only go up.
* This shit is literally already airborne. 🚀

# What is GOGO?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/px6mw3wqlo571.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bfc63d72c4fccadc629203579de0d395a58e215

So I had never heard of GOGO before doing my SMELLy research, probably because I've never flown. Basically, Gogo Inc. provides in-flight internet for business aircraft at a cost to the user. They're present on airlines world-wide so you already know they've got opportunity in the expanding third world airline markets. Gogo used to service commercial aircraft as well, but they sold that portion of their business last year for $400m cash to survive the pandemic. It's not that big of a big blow since they service 2.64x more business aircraft than they did commercial.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wf2aj00tlo571.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&s=85b2209952863d4fd8836cbd7f4c3fa5d431c534

Dumping commercial aircraft doesn't worry me. Business aircraft is their strength and I like to see a big dick CEO who is willing to take dramatic moves to stay agile and pivot towards a company's strength during emergencies. In terms of numbers, Gogo is projected to do 318.5m in revenue this year and 352m in revenue next year.  According to Robinhood they've beaten EPS projections for three straight quarters, recovering from COVID-19 much more strongly than expected. Per ORTEX says they've got an EV/EBITDA of 14.31, in line with the industry mean; and a positive EPS change of 16.21%. Plus an analyst price target of $13.25, so it's still under fair valuation. **In other words, this company is perfectly fundamentally sound, it that kind of thing matters to you.**

&#x200B;

So why is it shorted? Well, short interest has actually been falling from peak levels pretty consistently since March 2020 - despite a short lived surge where they got fucked in September 2020 and a recent uptick in shorting last week. Still, SI is 30%+ so let's use the 🌈[🐻](https://emojipedia.org/bear/) case to consider reasons not all shorts have exited their position.

Some airlines, like Delta, are transitioning to free internet to differentiate themselves from low cost airlines. But budget airlines have been rapidly expanding worldwide, and one way they remain budget is by letting services like Gogo handle the internet, so I actually see a huge opportunity for growth in that sense.

Some of the shorting could be fears that SpaceX's Starlink might hurt their long term growth, but that's a pretty fucking big *maybe* at the moment. Daddy Musk is a master of over promising so I think Gogo is safe in the air for a while. It could also be the fact that they currently have the investing equivalent of an ambulance chaser lawsuit filed against them, but they already defeated an almost identical lawsuit in 2019 so I'm not worried.

# GOGO SMELL Test

If you've been keeping up with the DD that gets posted, you know that the SMELL test is the best new method for determining undervalued potential meme stocks. So how does GOGO do with the SMELL test?

* **Short Interest:** SI of float is currently estimated to be **31.37%** by MarketWatch. If you're familiar with the SMELL system, you'll know that the purpose of SI isn't to create a squeeze but to add a possible extra source of buying pressure. Based on ORTEX data, 1/4 of that short interest is new as of last week, when the price was around $14.50. If the price rises again, shorts have already shown that they're willing to end their position. In fact, most 2020 shorts had already been unwinding their positions since at least January - until they came back last week.
* **Market Cap:** Market Cap is $1.3bn per Yahoo, so it's legit.
* **Extremely Memeable:** The name is literally GOGO - the thing it's going to do over the next 6 months. Of course it's fucking memeable.
* **Low Liquidity:** Average volume is just 2m shares according to Yahoo, or 1.8% of market cap. Institutional ownership is 46.11%. According to Yahoo, investors like Vanguard, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley have all recently added 20%+ compared to their previous investment. Per ORTEX, insiders have added 10m more shares total over the past twelve months.
* **Low Risk:** IV is 66%, so not great but not terrible. It was difficult finding any SMELL test candidate with IV under 60%. However, volatility is within the 4% percentile rank, meaning that IV was only lower 4% of the time in the last year. So this is as safe a time as ever to get in.

# Expectations:

Previously, the stock exploded in Sept 2020, and climbed up to it's 52 week high of $17.23 in January of this year. Apparently this stock already has a small following of short interest hunters and got caught up in the January madness although I don't remember reading about it. After Jan 28, it fell down to $10 in April.

Since April, however, it was steadily rising until last week when approached $15 - at which point SI increased by over 50% (estimated 10.8m [➡️](https://emojipedia.org/right-arrow/) 17m) and the price quickly tumbled back to $11.50.

**Based on history, indicators, and fundamentals, I believe the stock will repeat it's climb back to $15 as most shorters continue closing their positions and Gogo once again posts positive Q2 2021 earnings.** 🚀

# Positions and Price Targets:

**100 Aug $15c**

**200 Jan 2022 $15c**

**100 Jan 2023 $15c**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nl08ibwzlo571.png?width=1091&format=png&auto=webp&s=15c5450e79b4418622ba39accf9e31260e8d4b82

The $15 strikes have the most reliable open interest, and my preferable amount of risk. Earnings are expected Aug 9, and I expect that like most stocks, the price will rise in the couple of weeks beforehand in anticipation of another beat, then dip afterwards.

[🐂](https://emojipedia.org/ox/)🎯 - $17

🌈[🐻](https://emojipedia.org/bear/)🎯 - $12

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ITUB DD - Come get you some tubs of crispy Brazilian Mafia 🚀 tendies # TL;DR - options activity indicates a move coming up for the largest private bank in Brazil. Brazil has jungle, apes live in jungle. Apes get into Brazilian Mafia, take over bank, and loot it of crispy tendies.

In all seriousness, we've got a waking giant on our hands here. A couple of weeks ago someone started piling on just out of the money call options for ITUB. That trend has continued to the point that we're looking at massive amounts of OI on the July monthly call strikes. See here:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nd25kagxfn571.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ca4ab50a3eb9f3310f3c6e8b391ce1298c7535a

ITUB is the ticker for Itau Ubanico which is the largest private bank in Brazil. The banking scene down there has suffered in recent years as smaller fintech guys have tried to insert themselves into the Brazilian market which surprisingly (to me at least) is in the top 10 in size in the world. However, we all know Brazil from various action films with hot chicks and shady mafia dudes on mopeds wielding machine guns speeding around killing other bad dudes trying to catch Mark Wahlberg or whoever. Brazil isn't the cleanest place in the world - the top 5 banks own 80% of the market **with ITUB being the largest player**.

# The difference between ITUB and the other guys? They're molding their business to the modern age...

\- Their mobile wallet application is 3x as popular as the next competitor and has received millions of downloads in the last couple of months alone. 

\- A whole range of new digital services are being unveiled to serve their clients including digital sales and service management, financial management, automatic invoicing, and live accounting support.

\- They're getting their name out there like never before by exposing themselves to new markets, like partnering with LOUD (one of Brazil's biggest e-sports organizations) making them the first bank sponsor of such an entity in the country.

\- They're investing in their digital future, hiring over 4,000 employees in IT alone in the last 12 months which makes them not only the largest bank in the country, **but also one of the largest tech companies too.**

#  This stock doesn't move, why would it now? Good question, retard, and the following is speculative:

\- Back in November, ITUB was mulling spinning off its stake in a brokerage. [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-itau-unibanco-holdg-xp-idUSKBN27J2VV](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-itau-unibanco-holdg-xp-idUSKBN27J2VV)

\- Word on the street is that Brazil's central bank has approved this and the announcement is forthcoming. 

\- One could see a positive catalyst like this providing the needed push for a gap-up to pre-covid levels of $9 or so. 

\- "" A source close to the discussions said Itau hoped to unlock value in the bank’s XP stake that is not reflected in Itau’s share price, and reduce potential conflict between the two entities. ""

Why else would someone pile into options contracts like that? A bonus nugget, Buffet invested $500 million into ITUB earlier this year.

# The contracts are cheap. The potential is big. Do your own DD and see what you think.

See you on the moon.  **🚀**

2021-06-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Hunting Bears with $ASO  ASO just blew earnings out of the water last week & their stock price  is continuedly beat like a red headed step child for no reason

Here is some notes from one of the best earnings reports I have ever seen

*For the three months ended May 1, the retailer posted an adjusted income of $182.5 million, or adjusted earnings of $1.89, versus the prior year’s adjusted income of $400,000, or adjusted earnings of 1 cent per share.*

*(Wall Street had predicted earnings of 84 cents. Revenues advanced 39.1% to $1.58 billion, compared with consensus bets of $1.51 billion.)*

$ASO is Academy sports and outdoors. They are a sports equipment store and a hunting store that sells guns & ammo. I would describe them similar to Dick's but more focused on their core selling points, they aren't spending money making their stores look like a extravagant mall. I have been too ASO many times and overall enjoy their store & from my personal experience they have been consistently busy this past year and the days ammo arrives there is always a line around the building at 7 am of people trying to get some before they sell out.

ASO IPO'd in October of 2020. ASO is a fundamentally undervalued stock. Last week they absolutely smashed earnings by doubling EPS. Estimated was .46 and actual was 1.09 Their revenue increased as well. Their net sales increased 18% over last year. They have a market cap of 2.63 B and trade at a P/E of 7.66 as compared to Dick's which trades at a P/E of 13.85. As you can see this stock is criminally undervalued as compared to its peers. IPO lockup period ended on 3/31.

The stock has been shorted from the start because I believe it was just lumped into the typical brick & mortar category and will just assumed would bleed out due to online shopping. This was a grave miscalculation as ASO provides a niche variety of products that the online space is not fulfilling adequately & their top competitor Dicks has been backing out of like guns and ammo. They have a current short interest of 14% with a public float of 55M. The stock currently is at a all time high of around $40, that means every single hedge fund that shorted this stock is negative now. With some more volume and upward pressure in this stock and we could see a squeeze similar to the one that happened with RKT. IV is very low on the option chain  still and I think this thing could go to the moon. 

TLDR: ASO is a fundamentally undervalued stock that is currently trading at close to a ATH with high short interest with low IV. this stock should be trading $50 at least in my opinion.

Positions: (6) 7/16 30 strike calls

That said, let’s get real. No fuckin way gun control gets passed any time soon with the senate we have. And if it did, no fuckin way it survives the 6-3 Supreme Court we have. 

I can be a realist and an idealist. And yes, what I want and what I’m gonna get are opposites when it comes to gun control. 

TLDR; gun control ain’t happening. And “fear” of impending gun control = more gun sales. (Just look at the FBI background check data. We were at 900k a month in Obama’s first term. And it shot to 4M+ a month the moment Biden got elected.)

The government is not gambling billions for a vehicle that needs to last 30 years. And not just last but be serviced by that same company. The only reason to buy it, is to partake in this fake rumor when deep down you know that the US government isn't going to contract with them over a military company older than anyone here, and has built all the US militaries vehicles including billions for the new MRAP. Long story short go back to speaking ape and stop spreading this BS and creating bag holders."

id like to think they 'could.' in theory.  
i like workhorse as a company. but this contract is out of their league. not to mention how much of a political show it would end up to make it happen.  
sure take a lotto ticket on it. but in terms of any serious investment, workhorse for this reason is not a good argument."
2021-06-17 13:28:37,wallstreetbets,I have yet to see any workhorse ups or fedex trucks out here. They have none at my local ups hub where my friend works. It’s somewhat rural here and I suspect that’s why.

2021-06-17 06:30:59,wallstreetbets,Nobody likes a sore loser. But really they didn't get picked for a reason and can't bully their way to get picked. Workhorse with the amount of cashburn they have won't even exist to service the vehicles.
2021-06-17 13:20:30,wallstreetbets,They have no reason not to fight it.

but i dont know, neither does workhorse."

  ITAU as a whole has had diminishing ROE for the last 5 years or so. I wouldn't rely on a fad or some clickbaity news to invest in it.

This company is actually awesome, which is why I kind of find the reactions here hilarious. They are future proofing the electrical grid, have a massive backlog of contracts all over the country, and are the main player in a multi-trillion dollar industry. You'll know this name in a few years when it's a $300 stock. Again, dumb to be posted here, as it doesn't need WSB's support. I've personally been following this SPAC/stock for 6 months and yolo'd warrants near the bottom-- since May 18th I'm up $190k, and it has no signs of slowing it's bull run any time soon."

Start with a small home battery and simply connect a second on if you use more electricity than the average household. As you get bigger the margins grow smaller, and I think going with most affordable consumer product will have the highest margins long term."

No you can't. That defeats the entire purpose of saying ""I'm long"".
  
  
You can't sell the stock then say ""I'm long on it"" because you obviously aren't if you sold. 
  
  
Being long is ""i bought this stock and I'm holding it for a long time""."

You can't say ""i sold all my shares because it was going down but I'm holding long"". By definition you're not ""long"". You were short. 
   
  
It doesn't matter if you think it will go up in the future. You don't own the stock. But you will buy when you think it's about to go back up, right? And sell it before it goes down again to take profits, right? That means you're short. Not long."

2021-06-16 20:17:36,wallstreetbets,"I don’t see any evidence that a “short squeeze” is even possible in this market. I guess we would have to define a short squeeze more clearly. I came to understand it as a very rare and dramatic occurrence, like those images of the VW chart. And I came to understand what happened at the end of Jan and again in Feb with GME to be gamma squeezes. I might be wrong, but I don’t think that the VW type of dramatic short squeeze is possible in these markets, and that what S3 is talking about and what Reddit is talking about may be two different things. (S3 called Jan squeeze a short squeeze, reddit did not). If a short squeeze is just a few short shorts exiting somewhat simultaneously, then that happened with AMC two weeks ago, and it could happen again if the price drops and the IV drops and people are still dedicated to buying and holding (they are). The price will never reach 1000, it will probably never reach 100, it will probably never reach its ATH, but maybe you could nail 1000% on some calls again if conditions are perfect. 

Idk. I’m just talking outta my ass fantasizing about making a quick buck. But I would like some rational strategy one way or an...oops, wait, there I go all in Amc"

2021-06-16 21:36:03,wallstreetbets,Whyd you buy in April 2020?
2021-06-16 21:42:44,wallstreetbets,"Because despite being a dogshit company, there was still moderate upside simply because they were really beaten down from covid. This was also prior to them 5x’ing their float. 

My second buy was more shares on Jun 4, 2020 @ $5.24 average. Same reasons, reopening trade, float was still reasonable. 

Now the stock is 10x that price, the float is 5x the 100m outstanding in early/mid 2020, the financials are still shit, and it’s undervalued?

Wow goddamn. Where were all these AMC fanboys a year ago?"
2021-06-16 21:50:54,wallstreetbets,"First of all I've never said the company is undervalued. The price action that is happening and going to happen is related to short interest. And yeah the float is 5x as large but it's also  shorted to beyond reason. 

The GME and AMC price action happening right now is what happens when short sellers get fucked. Im just taking advantage of a good opportunity. That's what free market capitalism is.

Also getting in in summer 2020 is arguably more of a gamble than getting in when AMC is trending and the short position isn't covered. Thats what that CPA doesn't get. $4 billion of the what $5 billion of AMC debt isn't due until after 2026. 

What matters right now is how much of the float is owned and how much of the float is sold short. It's really not a complicated play 2+2=AMC 🌙"
2021-06-16 21:55:16,wallstreetbets,"I don’t find the short interest in AMC to be high enough to justify a squeeze, but that’s just me. And I guess I find it odd that while you’re honest — it’s NOT undervalued — way too many fuckers here drone on and on about how the company is undervalued and how theaters are the future of entertainment. 

The same shit they say about GME and how a once loathed company is suddenly amazing because they’ve changed executives and nothing else. 

It’s insanity. 

But if it moons I’ll be happy, I’ve got hundreds of shares with a low cost basis on both those meme stocks (got into GME in April 2020 as well at $5.46) so I’ll be rich. And realistically it’s in my interest to hype them. But I just can’t. They’re both such shit overvalued companies."
2021-06-16 22:17:31,wallstreetbets,"Believe it or not but I actually agree with you on the value argument for each company. I think GME leases most of their locations and I know for a fact AMC does. If they outright owned the property for each location (take for example ORLY) I could probably support that argument.

Also at this point there's no need to hype either one up. It's more than likely at the point of no return. 

I think its interesting you mention GME was a once loathed company....this is very true.

Also short interest is atleast 20% of float on AMC. That's self reported data.....go look at the dark pool volume every day for AMC its like 60% of the volume for each day. Naked shorting is also coming to light. But that is speculation and hard to support"

1) they’re claims are illegitimate 

2) hypothetically speaking, if they were legit, they don’t affect anything with the company.

The fact of the matter is DKNG could literally dump SBTech tomorrow, pay some lawyer fees and move on. This is blown way out of proportion for the sake of HR trying to make some money."
2021-06-16 22:42:24,wallstreetbets,"You didn’t read the post. The fact of the matter is their article was made to make their short position profitable. Their claims are complete and utter dog water. CNBC, Credit Suisse, Alpha, they all agree. DraftKing’s could legitimately drop SBTech tomorrow, pay some money in lawyer fees and then this situation is resolved and Hindenburg Research would ultimately close their short position.

But, I for one, don’t think their (HRs) claims hold any weight. Essentially what they’re (HR) saying is SBTech has a second company BTI, which handles all the illegal markets revenue. There is no paper-trail connection between SBTech and BTI. BTI may have illegal claims to unregulated markets, but SBTech and BTI are TWO separate companies. Their “connection” claims are based off five items. 

1. An instagram post of SBTechs Founder and BTIs CEO. 

>This shouldn’t matter. Two individuals at a conference taking an image together, they’re two competitors in the sports gambling market. How is this any different than any CEO’s getting pictures together- of course one may be running an illegal business.

2. Coding of SBTech’s platform within the website’s script (they went into google chrome- and used the inspect tool) 

>BTI is possibly leasing material to unregulated markets, it’s not out of the picture that they may have stole their source code off SBTech from back in 2014-2018 (pre-DKNG acquisition). That’s all that proves, that they have similar source code. 

3. A screenshot image of the proximity between SbTech’s office in Bulgaria and BTI’s office in Bulgaria. 

>Don’t get why this was ever relevant. 

4.  Possibly made up references from ex-employees (which they have gotten in trouble with faking before in 2019).

>again, it’s he said, she said. I dont trust a company that’s already gotten charged with faking similar information IN A PREVIOUS PUMP AND DUMP SCANDAL (Also check out their Lawyers- sketchy connections between certain Lawfirms and HR)

5. A transfer of employees from SBTech -> BTI. 

Individuals in certain industries transfer employment to local competition all, the fucking time.


Look, I get what you’re saying. HR did claim SB Tech may have been involved in illegal business with Iran, China, Vietnam from 2014 - 2018. But that is prior to the acquisition by DKNG. You really think DraftKings would be able to go through the rigorous process of background checks / investigation of financials for getting a casino license with an illegal company attached? Hell, fucking no. HR may have been right with previous companies, but as I said, this shit is a fucking stretch on their part, anyone with google can tell you that.

Selling liquor use to be illegal.
Selling weed use to he illegal.
Soon - sports gambling won’t be illegal.

The real issue here is the stigma behind sports-gambling. Give it a few months and this HR thing will never fucking matter. All that does matter is the expansion of gambling. State by state, this market is fucking BOOMING."
2021-06-16 23:28:26,wallstreetbets,"The report is full of criminal allegations. If a corporation or its officers get hit with criminal charges and can’t defend it, it’s very different from an sec violation. It can be the end of the business, forced rapid sale of assets, etc.

Given the scope alleged hiding behind the corporate veil of sbtech vs draft kings may not hold up that well. That’s the point of Hindenburg pointing out 25% of revenues."
2021-06-17 01:45:49,wallstreetbets,"I did read the post. I also question HR’s motives like you do. HR could easily be orchestrating this for a quick return. 

If HR is right about their claims, then DKNG did go into business with SBTech after fully understanding their ties. That would cost DKNG more than the revenue SBTech generates. 

I’m not sure if HR is right about their claims though. I just don’t think it’s worth the risk when there are plenty of other plays in this space."

Yes, HR did say they may have had blackmarket ties back in 2014-2016. When sports gambling was no where near as regulated as it is today, and not to mention, they didn’t become part of DKNG until what, 2020 after the SPAC merger went through?

2021-06-16 23:54:31,wallstreetbets,"Right, you don't understand what they are alleging.

They alleged a bunch of **federal** law violations directly or indirectly w/ regards to SBTech - Iran sanctions, FCPA, money laundering. States are concerned with money laundering and gambling regs, but banking system rules around money landering are meatiest when federal, and FCPA and Iran sanctions are federal, not state.

Any one of those is potentially existential for the company if true, if the main company knows. That goes beyond revenue impact of SBTech being blown up.

DK IR has not yet issued a press release in response. That to me suggests they are scrambling or are already doing an internal investigation to clean house."
2021-06-16 23:57:15,wallstreetbets,"If DKNG did indeed do a close examination and clean house, they should be able to say so quickly and clearly to lay this issue to rest. Had they done so, they would've already settled with the appropriate regulators. But, the IR site has nothing."
2021-06-17 00:03:09,wallstreetbets,"You’re interpreting the timeline’s incorrectly, those reports regarding Iran, Asia, were back in 2007-2014, under an entirely different compamy - BTi/Coretech. HR is trying to establish a connection with SBTech and BTi when there never was one. I go into further detail in this on my other comment to you. 

Regardless any illegal activity that HR thinks took place, happened prior to the merger of the SPAC, they are squeaky clean. You really think a company would be able to pass the rigor of obtaining a gambling license with illegal activity going on the background? 

Absolutely not.

DKNG has released three statements. Do. Your. Research."
2021-06-17 00:07:32,wallstreetbets,"They’ve released statements, saying it’s a false report. I wouldn’t be surprised to see DKNG file a defamation notice in the next few weeks for their IR response. There’s nothing to be settled as there’s no federal/state investigation at the moment. HR on the other hand is currently under going a SECOND manipulation investigation by the SEC. 

The only investigations going on for DKNG are by paid-to-create-drama lawyer firms, with absolutely horrible backgrounds. Seriously, look into the firms conducting their private research."

On top of that, you can't solve bandwidth issues with more stellites due to channel sharing limitations (the MA part of TDMA/CDMA). Their best play is to try to lock down some patents and sell out for some IP. Unfortunately they are about 10 years too late for that. Just Google Qualcomms patents in this area. They are the biggest IP troll in the game, and they let may related patents expire. Not because they are idiots... because the tech isn't viable."

2021-06-17 00:27:49,wallstreetbets,"It's not weird.  The constellation is deployed from 2023 in latitudinal strips.  I picked 2025 as you have the full \~180 satellite constellation up, but prior to including any excessive ramp up.  Guidance from experts is that this model is likely conservative given how skilled telecoms are at elastically pricing capacity into markets to drive ARPU

I take the full CAPEX into the enterprise value calculation and also adjust for dilution.  I wanted to capture what the earnings power looked like on a ""built-up"" basis for loading the CAPEX while capturing the earnings power of that fixed investment.  I think it's the appropriate way to look at something like this.  This is how you'd analyze an apartment building, for instance, it would be on a ""leased-up"" basis.  

Because the fleet lasts 10 years, the CAPEX will go away.  However, you will have deferred CAPEX b/c you'll eventually need to replace the fleet.  To account for this, I accrue ""economic depreciation"" against the EBITDA as a reserve so that we have what amounts for a distributable cash flow amount.  On that number, which is therefore perpetual, I apply the multiple.  

I hope this helps.  XOXO"

2021-06-16 21:59:44,wallstreetbets,"Right, but how sensitive are the orbit timings to ensure global coverage? That presumably dramatically reduces the number of available 'qualified' slots where a constellation of satellites would work.

2021-06-16 23:59:32,wallstreetbets,"Without diving in too deep.

1) Inverse square law is a bitch for space based communications. High bit rate low error reception from even 100 miles away is extremely challenging and pretty much outside the laws of physics (with current or near future tech) for anything smaller than what you see with LEO constellations.

2) line of site will pretty much always be a requirement for any kind of even semi high throughout satellite based communications path. This will limit the market substantially.

Basically for this to ""blow up"" they have to break the laws of physics, which I don't bet against."

I understand you assumed a 10 year useful life and straight lined the initial investment as a proxy for maintenance capex, but given FY27E in itself has $500m of capex, how is only $170m the proper run-rate? Is there a breakdown of OpEx assumptions - monitoring costs alone have to be $65m or more, what about other back-office support? And yes - I’m very aware how to value this sort of business  (led diligence efforts on a > $1 billion DAS network). IMO the model as presented is oversimplified and at face value appears more towards optimistic than conservative. We don’t have to agree - just my opinion."

When I go downtown I don’t see hordes of 20-somethings getting shit-rocked hammered 7 days a week like 1997. I see seltzer water drinking goddamn models who belong to four gyms (a spin gym, yoga studio, high end gym, and CrossFit Box). 

Working out and looking like a model is the new singles bar.

2021-06-17 16:33:02,wallstreetbets,"Decriminalization is moronic. My guess is that someone did the math and discovered that they could put more people in jail if they let people use drugs. More people on heroin, meth and bathsalts = more criminal activity = more money for private prisons."
2021-06-16 20:09:16,wallstreetbets,Legalizing all drugs is fucking stupid. Ever dealt with a heroin addict that can’t get his fixed? A raged out crackhead bigger than you? A lot of these people don’t want counseling or rehab. That want those few tending you have left to buy more drugs. They will beat you to get it. They aren’t thinking straight. Go look at the crack epidemic of the 80s. It was also a huge crime epidemic.   This will cause a huge increase in crime as land is fought for and junkies fight for their fix.
2021-06-16 23:13:20,wallstreetbets,"Considering the amount of interest politicians have in their for-profit prisons, it is difficult to believe something like this might actually happen. Add to that the systemic racism & xenophobia that brought about drug war in the first place, and our country has a real challenge. Something like this needs a movement of the masses. A bold start, one that will probably be chipped away until its only a few of the less harmful drugs. I'm so heavily invested in weed stocks right now, everything from big players like Tilray to the little guys like Sugarmade. If this gets ANY traction, there's bound to be a spike."

&#x200B;

bottom line, we should be prinicpled in our beliefs and support them regardless of who else does. if you really care about making the world a better place, you should be steadfastly against the war on drugs completely. if you would mutter the words black lives matter, you should refuse to participate is this prohibition system outright."

 I mean, I don't want an illness to be treated like a crime. That being said....drug addiction isn't an illness, its a choice. I know people with debilitating diseases that cannabis helps.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

2021-06-16 20:25:02,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you understood your source. They are not saying the US doesn't have a spree shooter problem, we very much do as it is a regularly occurring issue in the country, but it is providing research to show a vast majority of shootings occur at concentrated local levels that are caused by a handful of systemic factors including poverty, discrimination and poor education. If anything this source helped broaden the issues of unregulated gun control. It's also weird to me that you don't care that noncriminal shootings, shooting accidents, and suicides by shooting and even spree killings are not to be considered when talking about gun control but only deliberate shootings spread out between concentrated areas of poverty and crime do count. All of these fall under a broadened access to firearm use. that being said there is a solution here that involves the betterment of our medical institutions and the vetting process of which individuals are capable of safely owning a firearm but the how in fixing this issue is also vague to me."

And yea, you're right, ""crystal meth"" is made on the street and legal meth is made in la and is pure.

And the violence problem that *is* plaguing parts of our country, as the article and other studies will show, is prevalent in a fraction of a fraction of the most densely populated, poor, and black communities; yes, that should be addressed. BUT, that is completely different than blanket removing gun rights from an entire nation. Every single person on this earth deserves to defend their lives however hey see fit. I don't see gun control and ""fixing"" gun violence as being compatible in any way, as they address entirely different populations. The people that are causing the problem, won't follow the laws you want imposed, while the people that will are negatively affected by undue monetary penalties or restrictions on their capability to defend themselves. Gun control pushes the lawful out of their rights, while allowing the unlawful additional ground to conduct their crimes."

But the amount of people committing the ""violence"" is so small, and so concentrated in particular areas that you could commit police resources to only the areas where it occurs (that article from before) and solve like 80% of the violence. But also because the tool used is just a means to an end, and in a world where criminals use criminal means to commit criminal acts, restricting the rights of law abiding people is literally the worst thing I can think of.

2021-06-16 21:38:04,wallstreetbets,"I'll agree with you that like all commodities, steel will probably do well in the coming years just due to demand and supply shock. 

But for CLF, how do you say it's a stable ticker when it has negative earnings. Operating profit of just 5%, almost 6bn (!!!)  of debt vs 110mn of cash. That's a DE ratio of 165x(!). 

Seriously how is this any better than any other steel related stock. 
 
Just because I believe coffee demand will rise as long as people drink it, doesn't mean every company is the next Starbucks. And my post isn't strictly anti CLF. It's calling out strange accounts that have just jumped on this CLF out of nowhere."

When I said stable I meant price action wise regardless of fundamentals. The stock has been in a bullish channel since the fall of 20’ and hasn’t had any pump and dump activity as of yet.

2021-06-16 20:40:18,wallstreetbets,"DKNG is way undervalued before the short factor now, should probably be at $70 IMO. Most of these other stocks in these discussions are trash."

2021-06-17 01:04:47,wallstreetbets,"$BB, why nobody cares

1) too many bag holders for AMC and GME
2) people  precognition of BB as mobile phone company
3) bb software hasn’t install in cars we drive, security not at a place that people experience
4) Financials so far horible"

CLNE has more potential this week but it’s not looking great right now tbh. With the price action behaving the way it is it’s hard to tell it apart from all the pump and dumps. I still have a little hope left for Friday but if it doesn’t work out I‘m keeping my position. I‘ve been holding since March so this was already a long term play for me."

And then they keep bitching about their short options going way ITM. Which brings me to...
2. None of them have any fucking idea how a covered call works. The amount of posts, memes, and general whining about OH NO MY CC IS ABOUT TO GO ITM indicates just how little they know about options trading. Again, they pretend like they know what they're doing more than WSB but they don't even fucking understand the a CC is a delta-positive trade. As soon as the underlying approaches ITM they turn into bears.
3. I wish they would talk about something other than CCs/CSPs/wheel"

I heard an absolutely horrifying statistic the other day. Even if you spend two full weeks of time with your parents each year after you move out, by the time you hit age 25 you'll have used up approximately 90% of the time you spend with your parents. 

This is because when you're a kid and teenager you see them almost every day, but when you're an adult you are much busier and can not see them as often. 

It hit me like a truck when I heard that. Thankfully I see my parents almost daily because they live in between where I work and where I live, so I pop around after work just to check in on them."

2021-06-16 20:47:31,wallstreetbets,"Same. I believe the next meeting is next month. We will have weeks of shit market depending on if the following 3 events happens in 3 separate weeks or in some combination

Events

1. Cpi week

2.  June fomc minutes

3. July fomc meeting

EDIT: Next month also happens to be earnings season. Another ER season ruined becaue the feds can't get their shit together."
2021-06-16 23:50:57,wallstreetbets,"many biotech have low market cap (1 to 5B), low float would explode on a good news from FDA. Also their price are usually relatively affordable (5-20$/share) and you want to play them on the bottom of their price cycle (they usually go up on good news then down on earning cause they are bad at monetizing).

Generalising quite a bit but keep an eye on a few with good pipeline and you can play those without too much trouble"
2021-06-16 23:50:18,wallstreetbets,You're not wrong

Milton was his nominee in the first place and was heavily supported by him. Also, the VPs of Itaú BBA and Itaú Unibanco (the two divisions of the bank, Caio Ibrahim and Marcio Schettini) resigned jointly shortly after Milton's announcement (probably due to political disagreements).

2021-06-17 16:25:56,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely it is. You’ve got to hot potato those options onto the next guy, STAT. 

My biggest mental hurdle when I started trading options was shifting my mindset from stock trading so many years before. If you have a quality stock, the longer you hold it the better. With options, particularly near expiry or on very volatile holdings, the faster you move out of them the better. If you timed a dip buy right, unload them the first peak thereafter. Otherwise it has to go up so much more to make up for the decay. 

Of course, every situation is different! But most of my experience has taught me that and it’s making me better income this way."
2021-06-17 09:12:44,wallstreetbets,I’ve been trading 20 years and I assure you did not start out with high risk trades! Just invest in solid companies and slowly let you money make more money. It will seem slow at first but with compounding it really takes off.

2021-06-17 02:44:39,wallstreetbets,"The increased price for raw materials root cause is not some impending financial doomsday. 

The global supply and distribution channels for raw materials takes months or years to get ""up to speed"". 

Much of it was throttled back or turned off at some point during covid. The U.S. and many other developed countries cancelled covid and now the whole world is ready to go back to work. This very sharp increase in demand for raw materials is exceeding the ability to manufacture and distribute these materials, and so the lead-time and price goes up. This is temporary. 

There may be a financial bubble (I am not a finance dude, my craft is logistics) but I don't think the trend of increased costs for certain goods has any correlation with a bigtime financial problem. 

Steel, plywood, PVC/PEX, industrial gases, ammunition, etc will all calm down once the global supply system catches up. 

The delay is that the global supply chain will not increase output/throughput to meet the immediate demand, because the supply system is very slow to react to sudden change in demand. The supply system will eventually overproduce if they attempt to meet a short term sudden increase in demand. 

To prevent this ""yo-yo-ing"" of supply chain logistics trying to match demand, it is much more efficient to simply produce and distribute and a recent (pre-covid) rate and let the short term demand flatten out and the supply chains will slowly increase or decrease to match the stabilized demand. 

If this concept is still foggy, consider the number of people involved, the fuel consumed, the miles traveled, to produce an automobile in the U.S. 

The tires come from Brazil. The rubber to make them comes from 4 different countries on two different continents. The chemicals and other consumables come from three different countries. 

The tail light assembly requires microchips from Taiwan, injection molding tooling from Germany, light bulbs from China (with their own manufacturing processes to manufacture the light bulbs), wiring harnesses from Kentucky, and hardware from Florida. 

The sheetmetal comes in huge rolls. The iron ore comes from Canada. The coke from West Virginia. The steel mill is in Pennsylvania. They get shipped on trucks to the rail yard and then by rail to the manufacturing plant that stamps out body panels. 

Now multiply this my 10,000 to get each and every component to an automobile. Now get them all in the same location and prepare for final assembly. Then rely on third party shipping to distribute those automobiles to every town or city on the continent. 

Now turn off or turn down half of those 10,000 processes. Now within just a few months, turn the industry demand back on to 100%. 

The global supply chain is delicate and slow to react to rapid change.

Make no mistake about it, he got lucky as all hell it happened when it did because he was only a few months away from basically losing it all. So because he’s such a maniac that bet huge on it (brilliant as well, but far from the only one) they made a movie about him and now everyone talks about him as if he was the only one that called it, which is factually incorrect.

So yes, being early can very often be wrong and lead to disastrous consequences. It very nearly did here. He would’ve been laughed at like Bill Hwang if it did. Timing is everything."

The market in 08/09 definitely had some similarities but people were taking out stupid loans on houses. At least houses have *some* real value that the banks or whoever is making the loans can reclaim if things go tits up. By a huge amount of margin playing and loans on assets like stocks… this is more similar to great crash of 29. *Everyone* was trading back then with crazy margin and loan rates and things blew up. There’s a huge difference between like repossessing a house versus something like stocks. Lot of these people probably have no real collateral besides a salary. If you haven’t, read about that time cause I’d be more concerned with a depression rather than a recession. Maybe I’m crazy"

2021-06-17 18:27:33,wallstreetbets,"https://www.statista.com/statistics/205937/us-mortgage-originations-since-1990/

Before 2008, the mortgage originations market was about 600+ billion each quarter until that subprime crash, and it only really got back to 600+ billion levels in Q3 2019! Wow! It's been at an average of 400 billion a quarter between 2008 and 2019. 11 years of aftermath! UWMC (and others in the market) are quite resilient it seems. I mean, it's still possible for a worse crisis than the 2008 subprime crisis to happen, but, if UWMC survived all this time..."
2021-06-17 18:33:21,wallstreetbets,"Yup! Market crashes can have enduring impact on market performance for years -  it took about fifteen years for the Nasdaq to return to the peak it hit before the dot-com crash.

UWMC to me is poised to withstand another downturn or even bearishness in their sector coming from rate hikes.   


I like the stock."

Today’s price action seems to have develop a bullish pennant  towards the end of day if bullish trend continues  we would need to  break 225 for sure this will mean bullish break from the wedge I can post the chart later on if you want .

2021-06-16 20:29:32,wallstreetbets,You’re funny I’ll give you that lol but if you wanna call the candles and analyst’s wrong then that’s your provocative
2021-06-16 20:34:27,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying it'll go up. I'm saying if you buy into a pump and dump, 9/10 you won't have the good sense to set appropriate stops."
2021-06-16 20:41:58,wallstreetbets,"I hate to be harsh about it but if you don’t know how to set stop losses or have a goal in a trade then you shouldn’t be buying into them. Personally I’ve made 40k this month on pump and dumps and I’m loving every second of it. Wish is a little different tho, it’s a great stock at the price and the candles match for a big upwind especially with wsb involved. If it hits my stop loss oh well I’ll still pull out green but if you don’t have a goal and a stop loss then you’re asking to lose money."

2021-06-16 22:19:00,wallstreetbets,Man so much manipulation at the $22 price today. I’m just confused as to why the fail to deliver shares still haven’t been bought. Here’s hoping for big volume tomorrow at open to push this up
2021-06-17 00:48:33,wallstreetbets,What strike price did you get it at if you dont mind me asking. Im new to options and I’m trying to understand how your call option went up 50% today! I bought 30x 7/16 30c calls today and I’m wondering if I f’ed up lol
2021-06-17 03:35:38,wallstreetbets,"My strike is $25

They would have gone up in value because of increase IV, essentially when I bought them the IV was low, but due to the hype in the last few days the IV shot up, increasing the contract value. The value will drop now, since the hype is dying off, so I won't be up 50% anymore, but since my positions in ARVL are super long term, it doesn't matter to me. I'm not in it for the short term.

Yes that’s a super risky play. You bought when the IV was high, during a few days of hype, it’s probably going to drop back down and your contract value will probably decrease quite a bit - essentially you're probably gonna get IV squeezed. The way you could make money is if the rally continued, and we saw crazy gains in the next 1-3 weeks, and the share price rose over $30."
2021-06-17 11:48:05,wallstreetbets,Gotcha I see it now where I screwed up! Thank you kind sir
2021-06-17 03:13:30,wallstreetbets,"Fuck yes. The smarter, non cultist, can see how they’re pushing “GME already squeezed” and know anything under $300 is a total fire sale.

Furthermore, RIDE was added to the Russell 2000, so shares will be purchased this month by the ETF's that follow the Russell 2000.

Probably not since you invest through Yahoo 🤣🤣 news. Do your own work and check back with me in October - ✌️""bro"" 🤭

Edit - A non-binding offer, also referred to as an indicative offer, is used in a sales process to establish the terms of a deal between the seller and the buyer. It serves as an “agreement to agree” between the two parties. Through the document, the buyer expresses an interest to acquire the target, but the agreement is not intended to be legally binding and, therefore, it does not constitute a binding contractual commitment to pursue the transaction to the end. It is often used to keep discussions and negotiations moving along between the buyer and the seller."

2021-06-17 16:34:54,wallstreetbets,"just released:

2021-06-17 06:02:25,wallstreetbets,"Very US centric take. The situation is completely different in other parts of the world. Yes, coal and oil plants are still being built, and are still cheaper than nuclear, but hydro+solar+wind is growing exponentially world wide and are in many places already cheaper than coal. That is even without carbon tax, which is a huge regulatory risk for fossil energy. CA and TX blackouts were due to shitty infrastructure in the US, not because of renewable energy. Look at the european energy market for instance. Interconnection from southern Italy to northern Norway solves a lot of issues."
2021-06-17 09:49:23,wallstreetbets,"Not US centric at all. Nuclear is the most expensive to build the plant, but offers the cheapest electricity in the long run. You can observe this in looking at the situation in Germany, Japan, Vermont, as well as CA and TX. The infrastrcture to make wind and solar gets MORE expensive as it expands, unlike conventional sources, because of the massive amount of diffuse land area and dispersed storage and backup system it needs to be reliable. It has nothing to do with the US having ""shitty infrastructure"" - thats just a popular self-loathing thing to say especially on the left.  When in fact States and countries around the world have spent billions pushing solar and wind and de nuclearizing, only to become more dependent on fossil fuels primarily because of what you said - they are forced into interconnection with grids that rely on more reliable sources. All the while their electricity is more expensive. 

The fossil fuel guys know all this. Thats why major environmental groups pushing wind and solar, like Sierra Club and NRDC, are actually well funded by oil guys. Why? Because the renewable shortfalls are made up for with natural gas and coal! And what they are really afraid of is not renewables but nuclear. The fossil fuel guys have recognized that all this renewable talk actually just helps them sell their main product and so thats part of where all the propaganda for wind and solar is coming from around the world, not just in the US, all the major companies do it."

Total still owns 43,441,801 shares."
2021-06-17 01:40:16,wallstreetbets,"What happened was that the Chief Financial & Accounting Officer unloaded just under 37% of his stake for almost $2 million. I would guess it has something to do with the 8-K that was filed yesterday.

Edit: 28% of what he dumped today, he acquired via exercise (maybe options about to expire).

Edit 2: I am not at the machine either, but on my phone at a place with shitty reception (vacation will do that to you).

Edit 3: Since you at some point mentioned that you own about 5% of the company and that you would be voting “no” to the proposal 5, were you the only one voting against? That’s what the vote count suggests or there about."
2021-06-16 21:33:11,wallstreetbets,"I wish Total (or anyone else please tell them) would understand that if they would just relax and stop selling they could sell half the shares at $20 to get the same cash or 1/3 as much at 30.

Someone over there either can't read a stock chart, wants the price to stay down, or has some other motivation.

I kind of don't understand why Mr Clean gave Total so many shares, couldn't Clne just take out debt, use operating cash or sell the shares themselves at smarter times?"
2021-06-16 21:47:07,wallstreetbets,"It wasn't Total. It was insider selling dated June 15th, hence the Form 4. I believe it was their CFO, selling options and some shares. I'm not saying it's a big deal, just wanted to see what the consensus is 👍😊"
2021-06-16 22:13:11,wallstreetbets,"Lol yes it’s likely you know more about how to value the company than it’s largest holder 😂😂

The company sold 22M shares at less than $10 a share in the last month. Total continues to sell almost every single day regardless of price. So the people who know most about the business are willing to sell at $10 but you think you have some insight into why it’s worth $20?"
2021-06-16 22:15:16,wallstreetbets,"I do see a Form 4 dated today, June 16, and yes, this one is the CFO Robert Vreeland:

- Acquired 48,000 shares at $5.02
- Sold 167,783 shares at $11.6206
- Sold 3,300 shares at $12.06.

The form is dated June 16 but the 3 transactions on the form are dated June 15.

2021-06-17 11:56:53,wallstreetbets,"Sorry late in the convo, from what I understand you feel that it would trend better than Roku in the long term?"
2021-06-17 14:03:02,wallstreetbets,"I bought at $53 when my personal trainer told me that all the trainers were drinking it and later that day, my daughter asked if I could buy her some because her college town was “sold out”.  Was at the USRowing Nationals this weekend and can’t tell you how many of them were drinking it."
2021-06-17 02:23:49,wallstreetbets,"If you save 2-3k per month to buy contracts, how do you even have enough money to exercise a contract for SPY? Right now it’s 420ish so you’d need 42k. You’d basically have to sell the LEAPS for years until you have enough cash for that. Or, you could just keep buying the LEAPS and don’t bother with exercising at all."
2021-06-17 04:23:43,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't sell calls on the LEAPs under this strategy. This is a buy and accumulate strategy. Later on, when you have accumulated enough shares, then you can think about selling calls. But initially, you don't want to cap your gains by selling calls.

You are referring to something called PMCC. You don't want to be using +2 years dte on PMCC; the appreciation of the LEAPs won't keep pace with your 1 month writes. You want to buy around an 80 delta +1 year so that the LEAP keeps up when the underlying moves up and you're still covered. 80 delta gives you a discount where you can probably get at least 2-3X leverage. Selling 25 delta monthlies have worked out well for me. If you're going to get called, you can roll your LEAP up the strike (or keep the LEAP and wheel). Otherwise, you should be able to recover the premium of the LEAP in 2-3 months and have 9-10 months of selling covered calls."
2021-06-17 04:00:38,wallstreetbets,"In Dec, a month before they expire, you sell the LEAPs that you bought 2 years ago. Depending on how things went, some will be worthless, some will be ITM. In a very good year, all the strikes will be ITM. So let's say you put in 24k, and you get 30k. You need approx 24k again, so you set that aside (your principal). You use the remaining 6k to buy SPY. So no, initially you don't get many shares. But over time, you will get more. That's the magic of compounding and leverage.

Most people don't actually exercise their options; they close it out to harvest remaining time value."
2021-06-17 17:41:45,wallstreetbets,"I see a lot of bears on RIDE here.  In case you are not aware, June 21st-25th is the company's open house for institutional investors, potential fleet buyers, politicians and the media.  On the 25th will be a virtual event for anybody to watch online.  Those attending get a tour of the factory, watch presentations and test drive the Lordstown Endurance truck.  


Furthermore, RIDE was added to the Russell 2000, so shares will be purchased this month by the ETF's that follow the Russell 2000.  


If you want to hold off on investing until they prove themselves better, ok, but shorting over the next couple weeks would be a bad idea.  They are already heavily shorted and these two catalysts alone could be bad for shorts."
2021-06-17 17:16:18,wallstreetbets,"On the Zoom a couple days ago they said they have enough funds for through May 2022, but do need to raise more money to go to full mass production."
2021-06-17 17:22:30,wallstreetbets,"I was on the Zoom call a couple days ago.  They have $400M and no debt.  They said they have enough cash to get them through May 2022, but needs funds to order machinery to ramp up for full production, which they said the plant is large enough to build 600,000 trucks per year.  They said it takes nearly a year to receive the machinery they need."
2021-06-17 17:37:51,wallstreetbets,"They recant their statements every other day.

Two days ago they claimed to have offers to buy every vehicle they will produce over the next year.

Today they had to walk it back and admit they didn't have a single binding order."
2021-06-16 23:48:07,wallstreetbets,"I planned on a three-knuckler, but after my 12.49 limit sell triggered yesterday, I'm probably going to give her a ride in my minivan -- two in the front and five in the back."

2021-06-17 08:54:24,wallstreetbets,"Shit homie.  If only I knew.  It took me ten years to make $20k and I lost it in 1.5 years of trading.

Edit: what I am doing with GME to recover is to sell puts.  For example the action for 220P is 17.50 for next week,  if I hold the stock through that, I lose however much it declines.  If I sell a put against it, I get the option premium and if it declines further than that, I would have had that loss even if I had held.  If it stays above, 220 I would have regained 1755 from just a week"

2021-06-17 14:11:20,wallstreetbets,Good call. Did some DD of my own and bought in this morning. Up 105%
2021-06-17 19:40:42,wallstreetbets,Znga is making its move. Checkout my New DD.  Whales are moving in...get ready for liftoff.
2021-06-17 13:57:36,wallstreetbets,No positive news on AMC but everyone is on that train. Everyone is thinking its going to make money but it hasnt been making money before COVID and even on Blockbuster back to back summer Movies 🤷‍♂️. Unless they chsrge 60 dollars a movie ticket its a bust only reason its increasing is Hedges waiting for the right time to short it to hell you make more money the taller the tree. Wouldnt be surprised if Hedges are Frontrunning meme stocks
2021-06-17 15:52:18,wallstreetbets,"AMC has a lot more interest behind it at the moment, and sentiment has pushed them from the brink of bankruptcy into a really good position to take the actions they have taken. Cashflow is about to surge as people return to theaters after being unable to for a year, putting AMC in a position where they might even be able to buy out the other theaters that have failed and corner the market, especially with the multiple offerings. The short interest has been higher than SENS compared to the available float.

You're comparing apples to oranges. AMC doesn't have to market what they have. Everyone already knows and more than likely have been to their theaters in the past. SENS isn't struggling, but the hype was riding on the coattails of the meme stock rally, along with a late response to their clinical trial results. 

This is kind of a disorganized response, but that's really what your response merits. You don't seem to understand why AMC has run, which is why you believe that SENS can run like it did this soon. It won't. August will kill whatever momentum is held. It probably won't run up for real until September/October timeframe."
2021-06-17 15:52:49,wallstreetbets,"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
2021-06-17 16:21:33,wallstreetbets,"You said no positive news I said no positive news on AMC either. Malls as well as Movie Theaters are dinosaurs. I compared them because people are giving it value regardles of news so it makes your backing of AMC just similar to that of SENS. People give it value if they feel like it. But if you want to post something like you did dont back up AMC with such bias. You are basically saying SENS isnt worth its price because no positive news so I gave you the lowdown on AMC from my point of view as well. I have been saying movie theaters are dieing just like I have been saying malls are dieing since 2005 people are creatures of comfort its all about the ease of doing something Streaming is taking over Online ordering is taking over if you dont like it then dont post ""No positive news stock must not go up"" bs."
2021-06-17 16:26:03,wallstreetbets,Also btw yes AMC will be shorted to hell its not worth its price honestly. Everything is always an improvement of the last just go back a few hundred years and you can see the pattern. If you really think movie theaters will age well the past will tell you it wont. Either you improvise or you die just like Blockbuster did when they laughed about Netflix idea and kicked them out the door when they could of got them cheap.
2021-06-17 16:51:00,wallstreetbets,"In terms of my original reply, it was in response to the ""no negative news"" comment. It's not all hedges and retail. Plenty of other types of traders and investors out there. It was simply a counterpoint to the statement. About SENS.

In terms of bringing AMC into the argument like it's relevant, I reiterate my statement that you don't understand why the AMC rally started in the first place if you're making the comparison. Look back to the gamma squeeze that hit both AMC and GME back around early May. The same setup didn't happen for SENS."
2021-06-17 16:57:27,wallstreetbets,"Exactly its a squeeze nothing more. Im on the ride just for the money but im taking my gains and getting out. Trying to add ""good news"" about AMC movement proves my point and why I threw AMC into the conversation in the first place."
2021-06-17 17:03:01,wallstreetbets,"SENS isn't a squeeze, though. That's why it's kind of a silly comparison."
2021-06-17 15:35:00,wallstreetbets,I'm too scared to learn what options are
2021-06-17 16:10:04,wallstreetbets,"No problem man.
