2021-05-02 19:56:17,stocks,"Remember, returns compound each year, compounding interest is the 8th wonder of the world.

 10% is realistic, you can make riskier investments and that number could be quite a bit higher, or lower."
2021-05-02 19:55:53,stocks,Wait are you suggesting it’s bad bc associated with the rich?
2021-05-02 18:10:13,stocks,Thanks!
2021-05-02 17:51:03,stocks,"I hold several electric utilities. Mostly for the consistent solid dividend and low risk. But I’ve considered this part as well. The only disadvantage I see is the actual infrastructure is so inadequate, lots of money will be spent on it. Borrowing money to do so, will get more expensive as interest rates increase."
2021-05-02 18:50:12,stocks,"I mentioned it before on this sub but I like NEE. They are pretty well run and they are actually making money and are involved with a lot of projects and products unlike a lot of the speculative companies this sub often pushes. They do a lot of solar, wind, nuclear, and renewable natural gas energy production."
2021-05-02 18:27:51,stocks,Charging stations..mainly $CHPT. The have the most to gain because their actually the leaders in that sector.
2021-05-02 17:50:58,stocks,You can buy a company like swks now they  acquired silicon labs. You can play EV more broad by the semi conductors that they'll all need to use and save yourself from having to pick the winners.
2021-05-02 18:29:39,stocks,$ON SEMIS… is a big supplier to $TSLA and other automobile companies.
2021-05-02 17:59:13,stocks,Utilities don’t have much of a growth posture since they are so heavily regulated
2021-05-02 18:48:09,stocks,"How many charging stations does the world really need? Most charging is already done at home and people don’t usually use up all their charge just from going to work and doing errands. You can make a case for long distance driving so highway service areas should probably install lots of them, but other than that where else? Private parking lots in apartments maybe?"
2021-05-02 18:09:32,stocks,"I like semis too but that field is just brutal right now. Feels like an arms race with no end. Maybe I'm just risk averse but I like investing in monopolies where there's no competition lol

Although there's always SMH."
2021-05-02 19:07:41,stocks,"I would think that rest areas along highways and also shopping malls, and also designated areas like even at some major chains of stores"
2021-05-02 19:16:30,stocks,"Biden just promised adding 500,000 charging stations across the nation in his speech to Congress last week."
2021-05-02 18:46:34,stocks,"I'm risk adverse myself,  I always liked swks, but I bought intel after the drop.  They are trading cheap l, the consensus is that they're the loser of the group, I'm betting against the grain.  With the new ceo and working towards new foundries in the next decade,  I'm treating them as a growth company currently at 10x earnings.  Right now in the market that's hard to find. We'll see."
2021-05-02 17:06:10,stocks,"the year is 2030: you smirk as the market finally crashes. finally, your years of patience of holding cash allows you to buy SPY at a discount. You input your limit order to buy 1,000 shares of SPY at a huge discount of 500 dollars a share. Finally, the bears have triumphed."
2021-05-02 16:47:40,stocks,They been talking about it for MONTHS. I doubt we have anything large to worry about in the near future.
2021-05-02 16:48:49,stocks,"You won’t make any money by being scared. Will there be a correction in the future? Yes, almost certainly, but it shouldn’t control all of your investment activities in the present."
2021-05-02 18:23:52,stocks,"For those convinced about a correction, how if at all would you utilize VIX towards this conviction?"
2021-05-02 17:01:51,stocks,I would like to buy stocks at a discount so ill say 2300.
2021-05-02 16:50:04,stocks,"It will never stop, we're in an everything bubble.... might as well ride the wave till it crashes"
2021-05-02 16:52:36,stocks,"10%ish downside from what I read on CNBC. Some billionaire investor dude predicted it. For all we know, he could be having some cash lying around and is looking for an entry point."
2021-05-02 17:28:15,stocks,"Going by [OBV](https://i.redd.it/y1mqdw016wv61.png) looks like it should be around 3,000. Mega market crash incoming?"
2021-05-02 18:52:42,stocks,"> That is, our estimate of the expected (if the CAPE were unchanged over the period) S&P 500 annual excess return is 130 basis points a year lower than its actual realized return (which, being real life, included the real life CAPE appreciation).

> you were forming an estimate of mean returns in the future would you build a constantly increasing CAPE into your forecast going forward? I don’t think so. So, while 6.5% a year is what you actually earned in the market [edit: 1950-2020], 5.2% a year is what you might long-term forecast going forward assuming neither mean reversion in CAPE (i.e., falling from its high ending value in our sample) or continued permanent expansion (you are allowed to assume either of these, of course). Either way the equity risk premium has been healthily positive, but it’s 25% bigger if you, in my view wrongly, assume that the multiple expansion we’ve experienced is a permanent condition that should be built into future estimates. I think 5.2% is a better steady state forecast of the annual equity risk premium than the much more commonly used (actually nearly ubiquitously used) methodology of using simple realized returns not accounting for valuation changes that yields 6.5%.

Cliff Asness, [the long run is lying to you](https://images.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Perspectives/The-Long-Run-Is-Lying-to-You.pdf?la=en&hash=D3D54F4C180A564D8227FBCFCEC3366E)"

2021-05-02 17:22:50,stocks,And then the sp500 skyrockets 300% from it's ATH the next day causing the bears to panic sell lol
2021-05-02 17:59:02,stocks,"I keep repeating something I saw someone say, basically the markets will be around as long as money makes sense as a concept to humans. So all this ""correction"" will amount to is a nice discount for the future. Wish I would have been investing pre-March 2020

I guess that simplistic comfort breaks down a bit with options where timing can play a very large role, but then it's still pointless to worry about because there's no way to really know when it would happen."
2021-05-02 17:59:54,stocks,"You basically had that chance March 2020, why didn't you buy then?"
2021-05-02 17:13:07,stocks,"I think we're due for a correction but nothing as sharp as a March crash just imo a 10-15% pullback into consolidation into slow rise again

Probably due for it once the fed starts tapering purchases and raising rates"

2021-05-02 19:45:43,stocks,"So you would like to buy MORE stocks at a discount and are ok with losing likely ALL the gains (with S&P @2300) on all the stocks you supposedly already bought?

That risk/reward sure makes sense lol"
2021-05-02 17:43:24,stocks,"Wouldn't be surprised they love screwing over my generation every way possible.

Already got priced out of the housing market this year maybe they can kill stocks for me too"
2021-05-02 16:40:55,stocks,"Depends on the number of shares, if the price is significantly below or above market price, why the stock offering (money to pay off debt, to expand, etc?). In general in my experience the price tends to move to around the offering price, this doesn't make it support, but instead it more just adjust the current price."
2021-05-02 16:49:37,stocks,depends on where the support is. if they're offering at 50 and historically support has been at 55 and the stock gaps down to 50 then it just broke through that support.
2021-05-02 18:00:23,stocks,"I guess to not be coy, I'm mostly thinking about GME:

- Shares outstanding increased by 5-10%.
- Shares were offered at market value (ultimately around $157.50).
- Money was raised presumably to pay off debt & fuel growth/transformation.

I bought back in just before the news broke for the offering/the most recent runup, for slightly less than the offering price ended up being, mostly to capitalize on covered call premiums.

I'm no bagholder; I've been in and out a few times since November to varying but generally good profit. I've been considering expanding my position to sell more CCs (because fuck, those premiums are fat) but, while I am generally bullish long-term, understand the risk and am concerned by the volatility.

Is it likely at all that the offering established a new floor? If I were to buy at its current price, and it bottomed out at the offering price, I could make back the difference in 3-5 weeks; it's a slightly different story if it were to go back down to, say, 45 again."
2021-05-02 18:13:50,stocks,"I would ignore the offering, just use the chart to determine the current support/resistance levels and use that to determine your buy/sell price. From my rough 2 sec glance I would put support at 140, than 120. Offers rarely give a support, they mostly affect the current price."
2021-05-02 18:23:24,stocks,"I see, thanks. Any insight as to why that's the case? As I said in my OP, I would think that if big money is willing to spend half a billion dollars to buy stock at that level, there'd be a vested interest in keeping it at or above that level.

To reiterate: I am not a GME cultist. I do not think anything and everything is ""manipulation."" I am just working off the market as I understand it, and am trying to understand it better."
2021-05-02 19:11:04,stocks,"Well sure for the hedge fund(s) they might have an interest, but they are far from the only players. And just because they thought the price was fair today doesn't mean they will tomorrow. Also once they buy those shares they pretty much just hold them, its not like they're setting up a massive sell wall at/above that price and keeping the price up.   


Just look at penny stocks, there are a ton of offerings and the offerings often only tend to drop the price over time, even if its done at above market level. For many a offering is a company desperate for cash, which is not a great sign, but it all depends on how they use it.   


In conclusion you're best ignoring the offer, focus on chart analysis and dd to plan your investments."

2021-05-02 15:12:49,stocks,"I’ve cashed out of CCL and RCL.  They released large issues of stocks, have a poor income stream and until they buy back a ton of stock are now way overvalued.  

I would like to thank both for doubling my money from the crash on, and wish them luck."
2021-05-02 15:02:44,stocks,I like NCLH better than CCL
2021-05-02 17:31:52,stocks,Maybe for 2022 but think 2021 would be too soon honestly - even if they were to release ships they would be at half capacity maybe and people won't want to go. No one wants to be stranded on a cruise ship if an outbreak occurs
2021-05-02 18:03:04,stocks,Wait atleast until the news of cruise starts come out. That should boost the stock and give you a some decent profits.
2021-05-02 16:34:26,stocks,Ccl will get to 40 one day. Will keep until then.  No need to sell and pay more taxes now.  July cruises get going.
2021-05-02 18:38:14,stocks,The bearishness in here sustains me. Cruises will be back!
2021-05-02 16:00:43,stocks,"This. Absolutely zero reason to hold on to cruises at this point if you bought them right after the crash. If you somehow held this long by now you should qualify for long term capital gains. Cash out ASAP. 

The fact that NCLH and CCL are even trading around 30 is insane given the massive decrease in long term business and accompanying share dilution. Holding them at this point is pure greed, and entering a position is pure stupidity.

I cashed out around 16. Doubled my investment and moved on to trading companies I can sleep at night owning."

The app sounds like just a cheesy way to scrape data and 1) push ads to seniors and 2) push testing/treatment recs to seniors and providers to maximize Medicare payment income.

Which strikes me as a little schiesty.  Also, it's easily replicatable, and many electronic medical record systems already do this (evidence-based testing/treatment suggestions) at point-of-care."

Granma Yellen taking the time to say inflation isn't a problem, concerns me - since trust in govt is so low, few might believe that.  Thus, when $printer goes BRRRR, inflation will follow.  The commodity inflation has already begun pushing thru to consumer - from housing to recent clorox announcement.

Now all I need is a good prediction of WHEN...... :-)"
2021-05-02 17:10:01,stocks,"Mostly good info, with some bits where I, and history, would disagree.

But it leaves out the biggest thing: 

What happens to the economy, and the 99%, when your neighbor suddenly gets a great paying job on an infrastructure project?  He goes from sucking up social assistance dollars to being a taxpayer.  That's huge.

And when he gets that job, he gets confidence to lease that new vehicle.  And when he leases that vehicle, people at the dealership get hired.  And when they get hired, they go buy some clothes.  And that causes the apparel store to hire more people.  And when those people get hired, they flip from sucking up social assistance dollars to paying a modest amount of tax.  And when those newly proud job holders are feeling good, they patronize local restaurants, which creates and enhances jobs.  And when things are going decently well for all those people, they book vacations, and upgrade their housing, and do some landscaping, and get their nails done, and buy some pet supplies.

It's a very powerful, and very effective virtuous cycle.  Bottom up works, trickle down doesn't.

As for DCA, it's mostly hype and was a tactic of institutions to keep clients' expectations low and not blame them for poor performance.  

Getting in the habit of continuous investing is good.  DCA is widely misunderstood and not that important."

If you believe in this, I think the bill is a very strong long play on the US economy which will pay off in 20-30 years.

Of course, it will have a negative impact on short term returns on the stock market, in my opinion. But if nothing was done to the current direction, I would imagine a much worse situation in 20-30 years for the US.

2021-05-02 12:27:29,stocks,"It’s all about the differences in expectations.

For example: Everyone knew Microsoft and apple were doing great, so the solid earnings reports didn’t do anything for them. In fact, people who were even more optimistic and looking for a quick pop sold instead."
2021-05-02 12:21:33,stocks,"A majority of the time, if a company beats earnings then the share price usually rises as long as it’s not a quarterly beat with bad future guidance. 

The issue is, investor expectations and analyst estimates are two different things. Right now we are in a period where analyst expectations are lower than investor expectations. Just kind of impossible to know that until the company reports. 

But generally speaking, earnings beats are positively correlated with the share price rising."
2021-05-02 13:53:13,stocks,"When you’re looking at earnings, announcements and calls tell you so much more than just the 5 important numbers that consensus estimates show. They could be on top line, margin, EPS, etc but then announce some kind of restructuring or other headwind that isn’t in any kind of pretty table or headline. Those that have been following companies for years and sometimes decades care a lot more about ongoing business updates and small nuanced pieces of guidance that you might not pick up on as important. These are often (not always - depends on stock, industry, etc) the guys that have the capital to move stocks around"
2021-05-02 12:34:13,stocks,"A lot of it includes not just earnings but also guidance, which a lot of people tend to forget. For example NFLX posted great earnings but poor guidance which sent their stock dropping hard. I'd argue guidance is just as, if not more important than earnings."

2021-05-02 12:40:01,stocks,"Yea, I guess the best way to research would be to look at periods immediately following a recession when multiples are stretched. When PE’s are high(like they normally are following a recession), fundamentals tend to be irrelevant for a bit. Could look at 09-2010 to screen for stock performance following earnings. 

Either way, it’s still a coin flip because earnings can still beat investor expectations."

2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Twitter (TWTR) has done basically nothing in its entire publically-traded history I started investing in late 2013 and TWTR was the hot IPO at the time. I distinctly remember buying a few shares at $57 figuring I'd get in on the ground floor of what was already a culturally-significant company. 

Amazingly, over 7 years later the stock is trading lower than where I bought it all those years ago. TWTR has never paid a dividend or split their stock, so in effect they've created zero wealth for the general public over their entire public existence. I sold my shares for a wash in 2014, but I'd have been shocked to hear they'd still be kicking around the same spot in 2021. In an era of social media, digital advertising and general tech dominance, it's a remarkable failure.

On the one hand it provides a valuable lesson that a company still has to succeed financially, and not just have a compelling narrative. Pay attention to the bottom line - hype alone does not a business make. On the other hand, what the hell? Twitter has created verbs. It's among the most-visited websites in the world. We've just had 4 years of a Twitter presidency. Yet Twitter has seen its younger brother (SQ) lap it in terms of value. How has this company *not* managed to get off the ground as a profitable business?"
2021-05-02 12:55:45,stocks,"It's crazy how Twitter is such an integral part of media space, but at the same time they barely get by as a company."
2021-05-02 12:34:45,stocks,"They've never known how to expand the service in their own way. They bought Vine, but later killed it because they couldn't think of a way to make it profitable. One of the biggest social media apps in the last 5 years is TikTok, which just is a super-powered Vine. Then they bought Periscope, which had a really interesting version of mobile-live streaming. They never figured out how to integrate that very well into their own platform and didn't know what to do with it, so they killed that too. TikTok also now has a live streaming feature that works exactly the same way.   


Now Twitter has created Spaces as their new innovation, which is just a copycat of what the new social media website Clubhouse does, audio chatrooms.   


Jack Dorsey also owns Square and Cashapp and both of those services have expanded to meet the needs of consumers on multiple fronts to make themselves useful time and time again, but for some reason he always just views Twitter as this ""free speech haven"" and never leaned in creatively to expand it into a service that does more than blast someone's thoughts to everyone else. He could have had his own TikTok years before that app was invented."

Ok guys yes I understand what social media is and how they make money, it was moreso a question of what makes them unique? Other social media giants do the same thing so twitter isn't unique when it comes to revenue which explains their stagnant or shrinking share price. Twitter hasn't changed much if at all since inception. Other media giants have grown or tried different things."

2021-05-02 12:16:11,stocks,"Twitter is in that conundrum where it creates immense value for users: easy (free) to access news and discourse. Generally, the two ways to monetize such a network is A) ads and B) subscriptions. Ads are limited, in large part due to Twitter's technical issues on the backend and can only take one so far, whereas subscriptions are a door no one wants to go through and risk alienating users/open the door for competitors. Tough to see how Twitter captures more monetization."

2021-05-02 13:24:28,stocks,"I mean sure, if you bought into the massively overvalued IPO then you’re basically back where you started. That’s not entirely a fair comparison though.

It took a long time for the price to bottom out. 2016-2017 was the real ground floor, so to speak. If you managed to get in during that time then you basically doubled/tripled your investment.

I’m doubtful about the future of the company myself but to say it’s done nothing is kind of disingenuous."

But unlike their competitors never found how to get more original content on the platform that is monetized. I.e lots of videos link to youtube. Businesses of all sizes prefer facebook and youtube ads over twitter, seems larger companies like to twitter to get their message into your feed. Lastly instead of being neutral like many other platforms Jack has chosen to be political, which to paraphrase Michael Jordan, conservatives buy also."

I lost all respect for them after seeing a Netflix documentary about them (and Facebook/Instagram).

But the best comment itself on the product is a ny times article I read that said these ceos know their product is addictive and won’t let their nannies use any sort of electronic device in front of their kids or let their kids use these products themselves. So...that to me says it’s not a product of the future. I think you did good to dump it and thanks for sharing the story."
2021-05-02 12:38:34,stocks,Good thing disney never went through with Twitter acquisition. Would have been dead weight on balance sheet 🤣
2021-05-02 12:57:40,stocks,"Facebook itself used to be extremely similar to Twitter in terms of how they function as a social media platform. Ignoring the obvious difference in user base size, Twitter has some very clear flaws compared to Facebook (from a business standpoint). 

All social media platforms make money from 2 primary avenues: running ads and selling proprietary data.

In terms of ad volume, Twitter is not necessarily in a disadvantage, because to make up for a relatively smaller user base, they can always choose to increase ad frequency. 

However, they lose out significantly on margins on ads because their data is far less valuable than other tech unicorns (google, Facebook). This leads us into Twitter’s main disadvantage: value of their user data. 

At the end of the day, Twitter content is basically all textual (and some image). Combined with a character limit, there is quite a hard limit on what Twitter can extrapolate from its user data. Compare this to the raw dataset from which Facebook, Google, and Amazon can extrapolate. In turn, Twitter’s data is nowhere near as valuable to buyers of user data. 

The above is an extremely vicious feedback loop, because Twitter:
- cannot charge as high prices on personalised ads
- not as competitive selling data
- cannot compensate by simply increasing volume of ads, because there reaches a point where users will be upset at too much advertising

The cherry on top for competing tech are the calculated risky business ventures, such as Facebook business ads, Google’s extensive list of products, Amazon’s supply chain verticalisation, etc. 

In short, Twitter is not as competitive as other social media company on their primary business, advertising and selling data, and has also not been as smart as the others in diversifying their revenue."
2021-05-02 13:03:43,stocks,"Past performance is not always indicative of future performance. Twitter finally has some newfound innovative monetization ideas that they announced last analyst day. Good things to come, IMO. They have a huge established user base to work off of."
2021-05-02 15:49:29,stocks,Twitter is poopoo because of its decision makers. They haven't made meaningful changes in over half a decade and they constantly fail on value creation. I honestly would not be surprised to see it replaced over the next five years by other social medias

I like Twitter because it has a lot of societal value and I think giving them time they might be able to calibrate their model into something incredibly proftitable. They're constantly trying to innovate their platform, like Twitter stories and I think it is only a matter of time before they catch onto something that really benefits them, such as a Clubhouse competitor or subscriptions model.

2021-05-02 12:25:36,stocks,I’ve always seriously doubted the Twitter business model because FB prints money from all the ad sales (been true for a decade).Then Twitter makes dumb financial decision like not taking political ad money (which is where local TV stations make their most money) which compounds it. They didn’t even have ads when they started (and never charged the user) so that was a red financial flag on their business model.
2021-05-02 12:37:56,stocks,"Lmao, because they've basically banned/alienated half their potential user base for political and ideological reasons. People act surprised that a censorship regime of banning any and all ideological dissent wouldn't be a profitable business model."

2021-05-02 12:56:36,stocks,"People laughed at me when I said this a few months ago. I thought it was overvalued at $45 and I still think it's way overvalued at that. It's to Facebook what Yahoo was to google. It will survive for years to come in it's little ""breaking news"" niche, but the days of growth are long over. 

The valuation is quite ridiculous even after it's big dump this week. It's priced as a growth stock when it's clearly not growing and all efforts to grow the company have failed.

They had Vine. Vine was the same niche TikTok is today back in 2015. If they were able to make simple improvements to the app they could've had that niche in their back pocket. They mismanaged it and it failed epically. 

Anyone who has been using these apps for the pst few years can tell that it's gone down the tubes. It's a bunch of out of touch tech investing boomers who are like ""oooh tech stocks! Much growth!"" blindly buying this garbage heap.

2021-05-02 13:16:29,stocks,"My first job after college was at a small business. My take away from that experience is that good ideas can die if they're had by a person who doesn't know how to run a business or manage people or put a team together. That is, a good idea can't overcome bad execution. 

Likewise, there are good ideas with good businesses to execute them well that just aren't good investments.

A company I've liked for as long as I've known about it is Boston Dynamics. It's the company that makes the robots that have dog legs or are similar to a human and can duplicate how humans move. I invested in Google most of a decade ago in part because Google owned them. Then they were sold to Softbank, then a year or two ago was sold to Hyundai. Boston Dynamics does cool things, and I see how they're useful, but they apparently haven't figured out how to make a robotic product that has a huge demand yet, so as cool as they are, they're not a good investment."

2021-05-02 14:57:25,stocks,"They wasted their spotlight and never innovated. Their gimmick of character limit is actually a hinderance now rather than an advantage. Doesn't help how political they have become and even turned off people that lean their direction. Twitter is the new facebook in the manner that only older people use it to post their strange views. Not sure I know anyone around my age (late 20s) that has used it in years. And it has no redeeming qualities that facebook has in reconnecting with people and other content like videos and streaming.    
I see it as a house of cards that once the next thing after instagram/tiktok occurs that it will just be a ghost town of an echo chamber worse than reddit."

Twitter has lived so long not because it is good but because influential people have been using it. If it weren't for Trump, I could imagine a timeline where Twitter would have been bought up by 2017. Right now, what reason is there to continue using it?

I feel like social media is dying, but at least other companies are doing something. Twitter is just managing a platform from 2012, trying not to offend the mob that is using it."

2021-05-02 12:38:44,stocks,Twitter's primary problem is it being primarily text-based.    There are limitations of how humans interact with text-based content in this media-filled world.   The user engagement kind of drops after a few minutes compared to other photo/video-based sites like FB/Insta/SNAP or even tik-tok.

2021-05-02 13:11:02,stocks,"I remember hearing Twitter's been stuck at around 300 million active users for several years.  They reached market saturation, and ever since the site's been getting less pleasant to use as they try to squeeze the still-active users for more engagement to increase per-user revenue.  I stopped using it because of things like the non-chronological timeline.

It's an established platform that won't be going any time soon due to prominent figures using it, but there's no reason to buy stock, because at best the site will continue to stagnate, and will likely decline in relevance as shiny new services pull away the misanthropes and masochists who still browse Twitter in the year of our Lord 2021."

I would have thought the same thing intuitively, that it would have grown a bunch over the years in value, but hasn’t.

As a result, we now expect headcount growth to more closely mirror expense growth in 2021, with headcount -- and total costs and expenses -- growing 25% or more on a year-over-year basis in 2021, ramping in absolute dollars over the course of the year.

That's from their Shareholder Letter. I assume, they also have some targets which are not straight just for revenue. Like connecting the world, pushing free speech, not over advertising their twitter feed, etc. As I said, I actually don't know, that's just what could be a point."

Who knows but they’ve consistently let down their shareholders, alienated their customers and even banned a president. These are not the moves a properly ran company makes when they have their shareholders in mind. We argue about morality until the cows come home but financially they are irresponsible and have managed to lose value in the 8 years they’ve been public.

2021-05-02 12:27:34,stocks,"It's just a low quality version of FB's model – ads and selling user data are their main revenue source. Twitter is so spammy and full of fake accounts their data is overall lower quality and also due to all the noise advertising is likely less effective. I'm shocked it even still exists but kind of get it. They still fill a niche as a bullhorn for celebs (+wannabe comedians), and of course brand direct marketing. Also one of its strengths is that it easily facilitates connecting with random people you don't know (as yourself)."
2021-05-02 12:31:33,stocks,"It’s a data-collecting, advertising and promotional platform.

As it goes with any social media platform or site that regularly brings in millions of users on a weekly basis — it’s all about content generation in the form of limited text and driving people to other users websites/content. If it sees a ton of use, companies pay for the data and behavior of its users in the tens to hundreds of thousands, when it’s millions and millions of users.

It’s odd though that Twitter isn’t seen as any better an investment today though. Arguably, Facebook won that arms race when it bought up IG, and began its other multimedia platforms. Everything from poking its toes in online marketplaces, popularity of groups, video game streaming, media production, it’s all good stuff that bodes well for its longevity where Twitter has more or less wavered as its popularity peaked. Problem is, it’s gimmick is kind of its downfall. When it’s all memes, 10 word or less responses, and shitty media hosting well... the value of its shares says it all. 

Twitter should have capitalized 10 years ago when it rocketed to stardom and worldwide use as the “new and cool” platform usurping facebook within a year. It’s lack of innovation and actual content beyond being a communication platform for celebrities and some businesses is just... lacking. It’s fun to sensationalize celebrity tweets but aside from linking us to another website or something, Twitter just isn’t even worth the time anymore. Kids used to post inspirational quotes or random thoughts through the day, and that was the in thing to do. No more. Now it’s back to tik toks, snap stories, IG posts, etc. 

Hence, investors in the space would rather grow with someone like Facebook, than roll the dice with Twitter keeping its status quo — when it does absolutely nothing to deserve it... because if we know anything about the space it’s that much like Tik Tok and Snapchat, the next big social media platform is just one month of sensation and memes or celebrity promotion away from being the next hottest thing on the market."

For those who don't use Twitter (like me), I can already enjoy the Twitter drama from people taking screenshots of tweets and posted them somewhere else (like Reddit). I don't have to go to Twitter to see it, so that's less ad revenue. A tweet is short enough that a screenshot or two can capture the situation."

2021-05-02 12:56:04,stocks,"Yep. It's like people think that auto manufacturing giants are oblivious to the shift that's happening and will just let the Teslas and Rivians of the world take the whole market while they stubbornly fade away. 

It's like meat alternatives. You think Tyson is just going to roll over and not produce their own alternative in the event that meat starts to decline and alternatives take over the market?"
2021-05-02 13:58:10,stocks,"What Tesla (and a few others) have over the old school manufacturers (right now) is charge capacity. For example the ID4 while a very nice Crossover only gets about 250 miles on a charge. Compare that to a Tesla Model Y that gets 325+. While the 75 mile difference may not sway some, for me it is show stopper as I make quarterly trips of 300 miles so not stopping for a charge is a time saver.

I am a VW Jetta owner... love the car, but am going to go Tesla in a year due to charging capacity as I decided my Jetta will be handed down."

2021-05-02 13:43:35,stocks,"There’s a reason there have been so few new American auto manufacturers that have actually brought cars to full production in the past few decades. It costs a shit ton of money and years of development before they are profitable(assuming they get to production). Compared to other industries autos are pretty ruthless. 

I think before people invest in any new EV companies that haven’t even produced a single car they should consider: how much money it costs to build and run a production facility to bring it to production, how slim the margins actually are, and whether or not it is smart to invest in companies now that may either fail or take 5 years to emerge. 

Having your money tied up in something that moves sideways is almost worse than something that immediately tanks imo. It’s a lesson I’ve learned with Spacs recently."
2021-05-02 14:40:19,stocks,"Totally agree and VW have substantial cash flow to be able to invest heavily.  
They have brands already loved and trusted in many markets - some traditional automakers will fall away but VW and the like will still dominate."
2021-05-02 17:50:28,stocks,"This is the main reason why my only investment into EV right now is into companies that supply batteries, charging stations, and/or transit/delivery vehicles. Companies like Proterra, Lightning eMotors, even Bluebird. Selling shovels in a gold rush! 

Otherwise, the personal EV market is so so overextended right now. Lucid hasn’t even released a mass-produced vehicle yet, NIO is based in China in a time when we’re trying to move manufacturing back to the US, Tesla is somehow worth more than Ford, GM, and VW combined despite having a tiny real-world market share. Yes, yes, I realize that people are investing in Tesla due to perceived future value, for their coin investment, as well as for the fact that it’s a proxy for SpaceX, but that doesn’t even come close to explaining their current value. It comes down to the fact that Musk is a popular meme lord — I don’t think that kind of hype can’t sustain it forever though. 

OTOH, the commercial market is a lot less sexy, but it has a ton more room for sustained, gradual growth. Look at Biden’s infrastructure package and how much he’s focused on companies like Proterra; it’s a no-brainer for me, especially as they are already a profitable US-based business that has a large portion devoted to manufacturing batteries and charging stations. The main problem is that these companies are not yet fully public yet (other than Bluebird), so I understand why they’re getting overlooked. But long-term? They’re as close to a sure fire bet IMO, barring the end of the world or something. 

EVs *are* the future, but I think people are a bit myopic when they only look at companies that make flashy personal vehicles. The market is so
much broader than that but people are failing to
recognize that right now.

**EDIT**: I mean, I can’t blame people for only focusing on companies like Tesla or Lucid — I literally just saw an ad for the Lucid Air on TV. You certainly won’t see something like that for Bluebird or Proterra anytime soon, despite them occupying a high-growth market niche."

2021-05-02 16:50:27,stocks,"From an article I posted yesterday:  

As for SNAP's viability going forward, despite debt and lack of profit, many people may not realize there's been a major shift with respect to SNAP that kicked in about six months ago. 

Before that they were regarded as just another money-losing fad that would go away.  But to the analysts' surprise, SNAP managed to cook up viable plans to attract advertisers, and there's lots of evidence it's working.  They've had a couple of billion dollar quarters, and the inflection point of break even to profitable is coming much sooner than most imagined.  I think (?) SNAP has quietly snuck into third place among social plays.

And even the assumption that ""they're not profitable"" is superficial.  If you dig into the details of recent numbers, they could be profitable however they're putting that money into programs that attract influential content, which supercharges user growth.  And it's apparently working.  So the ""losing money"" stat is misleading, and when looked at from a different perspective, could be considered good news, not bad.  As someone who loaded up on AMZN during the final years of people saying ""but they're not profitable"" (while those people weren't noticing that profit or loss were levers controlled by Amazon) it's a familiar pattern that I find tempting.

As they've aged, it's been noted that SNAP has outlasted multiple projections of their death, by innovating.  They were considered a fad of being the disappearing messages app.  They re-invented to do filters, which continue to be inexplicably popular.  They've re-invented to do stories.  They're re-inventing now as group messaging, which is hot, and experiential, which is perfect for the now rebounding travel advertising segment.  It's becoming harder to bet on SNAP just fading away as had always been assumed.  

SNAP is also considered one of the less harmful type of social media and tech plays.  Where FB is considered pure evil, SNAP is considered benign.  Turns out that's good if you want to sell advertising.  

During this earnings season, SNAP weathered it about the best, compared to peers like FB and PINS.   Maybe next week will be SNAP's turn to get beat down, but so far, so good."

2021-05-02 15:07:21,stocks,"I'm very young, and 6 years ago people used it a lot and you were the social outcast if you didn't. 4 years ago, a lot of people used it, but IG was the in thing. Now, Tiktok and IG reign and Snap isn't nearly as used.


I'm in the UK, so maybe it's different in other markets, but there has definitely been a trend away from it.


IMO, the reason it's public was because of hype (bearing in mind that Snap was the in thing at the time), and so that they could divest."

2021-05-02 15:04:21,stocks,"True, but passive investing has meant that if a company can get into a popular index, they're far less prone to corrections (outside of those driven by macro effects).

TWTR hasn't perfectly mirrored the SPX (e.g. the last month), but broadly there are similar movements. More than 10% of the company is owned through broad index (S&P and communication sector mainly) funds."

Twitter was reporting on covid long before mainstream news outlets anywhere in the world.

Twitter was behind the Arab spring uprisings too.

Its also becoming a consumer rights tool. An angry tweet can quickly get a company to take a complaint seriously, where other platforms can easily hide or censor these complaints.

Finally there is live event coverage. Similar to news, twitter benefits from its simplicity and so gets used a lot for sports, leading nicely into live streaming too."

Where Tesla can be worth more is in their diversity into Green Energy generation and storage. While they are not the only players in the game there, they are setting the bar for consumer products in the field and it may take a decade for other companies to develop to the level of Tesla’s products and brand recognition. 

I do think that Tesla is over valued right now and that Elon Musk is someone to wary of when following for the purpose of investing. He has no shame in pumping securities and crypto to unsustainable levels and Tesla I believe is no different. I could be wrong at the end of the day, but I just have a feeling that reality will eventually hit for TSLA and I’m not going to be interested in buying in until that happens.

They aren’t oblivious, but they are slow and far behind. It was only recently that the legacy automakers actually started taking EVs seriously by way of pouring money into research. VW only last year invested in QuantumScape batteries, Toyota just bought Lyft’s autonomous driving unit. They aren’t even doing their own research. They are outsourcing everything to other companies. 

Meanwhile Tesla has been pushing full steam ahead since 2014. They are vertically integrating every step of the process, including the circuitry which is why they have been largely immune to the chip shortage. (Ford said in their guidance that they expect to sell half as many vehicles next quarter due to the shortage.) And Tesla is going to start making their batteries in house. Tesla will be able to produce better performing vehicles much more cheaply. 

The legacy automakers are in trouble. The question is not going to be which ones can compete but which can survive the next five years.

2021-05-02 15:09:02,stocks,"I'll be honest I'm less familiar with the Chinese OEs, we have a branch that deals exclusively with them. But there are a few things to keep in kind with them:

Foreign companies working in China have to release IP to the Chinese government and have Chinese representation in their company, which can affect what is shared. Some companies like to share older tech, others will develop with Chinese OEs directly. I think this is why Ford is so small in China, and FCA is almost non-existent. GM is the only US OE really working in China and they have partnered with a Chinese company to develop tech. That being said China is a massive, massive potential market waiting for investment, dwarfing the US and the EU (as is India soon after). Any company working there with their shit sorted will explode. 

China is going full steam ahead with EV development, I'd guess because of their air quality issues but also because they recognize that EV is the future. China wants to be the leader in this, and the US is lagging woefully behind. Japan is a bit more leery and working towards hybrids, the EU seems split between both, but the US just doesn't seem to trust them, plus regulations here mean the vehicles will be more expensive, Chinese companies can develop much cheaper because they don't have to satisfy the strict rules for consumer protections or use of dangerous materials and disposing of them afterwards. 

If you bet right you will make money, but keep in kind the Chinese government can and will step in at any point. They can shut down or appropriate any company they want, at any time. These companies are a key part of Chinese diplomacy (in so much as China wants to be taken seriously abroad and wants to sell to the world like Apple or Ford or Samsung do), so it's unlikely to happen, but still there is a level of government interference in any international Chinese government that I'm personally not comfortable with for investing. I might be missing a trick but like I say I just don't know enough about the Chinese market to be willing to put my money there."
2021-05-02 17:52:12,stocks,"Tesla - a battery company that makes cars, and has done very well doing so

Rivian - actually has a factory in a real rarity for this field, has interest from Ford and GM. Looks the most likely to actually bring an EV truck to market, which is what everyone is racing towards in the US. Has a contract with Amazon to make delivery vans already. 

Nikola - released a big presentation for its self driving semi trucks, then [mired in controversy](https://www.businessinsider.com/nikola-trevor-milton-controversies-gm-general-motors-deal-hindenberg-explained-2020-10) about whether they were actually building any trucks or owned the tech they were using. CEO quit after accusations of fraud and sexual harassment.

Kitty Hawk - seems more interested in niche plays than actually making something that works, likely to be bought up by someone for their tech. 

Faraday - made a big splash as they tried to gain funding, has repeatedly pushed back their target release date and unlikely to survive long enough to actually release anything. A shame, I liked the design of their cars, but yet another CEO mired in allegations of fraud.

Lucid motors - doesn't doesn't a factory but building one, a lot of people liking this company as likely to actually reach the road. Back by the Saudi investment fund, so honestly I see it vanity project but it shouldn't run out of money anytime soon. 

Lordstown - another racing to make an electric truck, aiming at about 50k. Very small, but backed by GM (see a trend?) and Fidelity, strangely. They at least have a factory, repressing one they got from GM 

Fisher - older than most having started in 2016, backed by Magna who are a huge auto supplier so they at least understand the supply chain and what goes into making vehicles (a lot of these companies, to put it nicely, do not). Still, hasn't really made much progress, and Fisker himself has a previous failure - though it could be argued that he then has more knowledge of what he is getting into. 

Then there are a plethora of Chinese companies working towards an international market, and with the back of the Chinese government they will have the cash to survive the bumpy initial period where they will bleed money. But honestly, most of these will not survive. The big, established companies like VW, BMW, Toyota, Hyundai, GM, Ford are all also developing their own technology. They have the infrastructure already in place and the cash reserves to survive long enough to bring to market, plus brand recognition. They already have a customer base. So what is more likely is that someone like, say, Toyota will watch these little startups (which are still valued in the billions) and see if they have proof of concept with a novel idea. Then after all the hard stuff has been done they can come in with an offer and buy out a potential rival, take their tech and best engineers, and use it in their own work. So honestly while you can make the most money with a startup, the more *reliable* way would be to invest in GM and Toyota and watch them buy the exciting tech and develop it themselves."

By levelling the playing field, I mean away from the stocks, it's going to be a crowded marketplace for decent size EVs next year - Nissan's Ariya enters the same segment as the Model Y, ID4, Mach-E, Ioniq5, Enyaq IV, etc etc so i think we'll see some of the legacies coming up in the markets a bit, gaining market share and likely a few points on their stocks, and they shouldn't be written off as 'dinosaur' companies yet that will only go down

The problem has never been just Republicans or Democrats. The problem has been *mostly* southern racists. It just so happens that since the 50s-60s, Democrats have managed to veer towards the side of civil rights and racial equality in the stances they hold, and Republicans were able to claim those southern states and racist beliefs for themselves, keeping them alive on life support all this time."

Combined with the EV tax credits and the savings of charging vs. buying gas, and this puts Tesla squarely into a regular non-luxury category for many people. 

Think long term and think five years into the future. The legacy automakers are too large and have too much debt. They have to keep making ICE vehicles so they can continue paying dividends and interest from corporate bonds. They are not going dive deep into EVs until the demand for ICE fades. They are forced to move slowly into the future because their shareholders and bondholders demand profits today. 

Tesla is not shackled in this way. They hold more cash assets than debt. Their share PE is also higher than average, and that is precisely  because people are pricing in Tesla’s future potential, and not necessarily worrying about what is happening today."

Think there’s maybe potential, they do shape the cultural conversation frequently and are big with live events and in the politics/journalism space, but capitalizing on that while remaining brand safe is challenging.

Also, editing your incorrect post to say, ""see my downvotes as proof"" doesn't make you any less wrong. You simply don't understand the metrics of why you're actually being downvoted.

And if you take time to examine and understand the upvote/downvote policy, it verbatim reads: ""Make your vote based on the content.""

This quite literally means it is okay to downvote something you don't like, which also defeats your original logic."
2021-05-02 16:00:34,stocks,"That's still not a free speech issue.  It's a rediquette and Twitter equivalent issue.  Maybe a TOC. But it's not free speech.

First off you aren't entitled to a platform, and secondly even if you're allowed to say what you want that doesn't mean anyone has to listen to you , or even value what you have to say/your opinion.

Downvoting and reporting is not an action  by the goverment limiting your  free speech.

And who is to say what the use of the downvote is or means? Reddit does absolutely say it's not meant to be a disagree button. But what if I disagree with you and think your comment is low effort and not contributing to the conversation. I didn't downvote you for what it's worth. I basically never up for downvote anything.  But  I have absolutely seen your nearly same sentiment over and over again from respectfully butt hurt conservatives usually. Always misframing what freedom of speech means in law, and what responsibility the goverment has in protecting it to protect their ultimately generally  unpopular opinions from backlash. It's not even usually banning but just fervent disagreement. Often to the point of toxicity but that isn't the point and still isn't censorship though it could be browbeating.

Anyways sure an obvious use of the downvote button is to remove visibility of low effort comments such as ""I'm dead"" but who is to say but the person using the downvote whether a comment is low effort? Like I said I didn't downvote you but Imo your comment isn't substantial, insightful and doesn't really contribute to the conversation in any original way. It's a bog  standard response that you've probably said somewhere before and gotten a  similiar response. That that isn't a free speech issue because free speech is a protection from the goverment not private Citezenship , companies or even employees.  You have a   right to say nearly whatever you want, you don't have the right to be protected from social consequences.

If that social consequence is Downvoting or a million responses telling you you're wrong that's not an issue of your free speech.  That isn't to say there are no issues with echo chambers and no problems with political and other  discourse online. But it's more the realm of sociology or something than a free speech concern."

You're right that they're not going to dive deep in EVs until the demand for ICE fades, why would they? It doesn't mean that these massive companies are incapable of engineering and manufacturing a slightly different product. It's not like electric power is some mystery novel technology that requires a huge amount of R&D. They release new models every single year, they'll phase in EVs as it makes sense to.

GM and Honda have already said they're going to be all electric by 2035 and 2040 respectively. Ford wants all electric in Europe by 2030.

I don't know what the future holds, but they aren't just going to roll over. This is not such wildly different technology that they can't adjust.

That remains to be seen. I don't think they will merely fade away without making any noise. But their jobs are going to be super difficult over the next five years.

Tesla Model 3 Standard Range: 263 mile range, starting at $39k

Chevy Bolt: 259 mile range, starting at $36.5k ($32k starting with 2022 model)

Yes if you want to compare $50k- $90k vehicles, they have the advantage. But again, this is luxury car territory. Average people are not buying cars like that, so auto giants aren't going to focus on that since luxury EVs are still a pretty niche market right now. Look for someone like BMW for that in the next few years.

> The year 2040 is twenty-frickin' years away 

Do you think EVs go from 2% of the market to 100% in less than 20 years? Their plans are to ramp up from now until then.

> EV will always be a side-effort to them 

Why in the world would that be a side-effort to them if EVs start to dominate vehicle demand? Yes while it's 2% of the market, it's *obviously* going to be a side effort since their focus will be on the other 98% of the market. If EVs become 60% of the market by 2030, why would you think that vehicle manufacturers would not manufacture the vehicle that's in demand?

That's great that Tesla is 100% invested in EVs, but it doesn't mean these giants don't come up to meet them there as the demand rises. I'm not trying to say that Tesla is going to fail. I'm saying they aren't going to be alone and dominate the automobile market for decades to come.

2021-05-02 12:59:29,stocks,"I personally would be content being open for all at the same time. 

no pre / after market bullcrap. 

why some portions of the market (aka participants) can buy / sell while I can´t doesnt seem like free and even market at all. 

problem is international markets. thus: 24/7 is probably needed anyways."
2021-05-02 11:32:03,stocks,"Feel a lot better if it wasn't manipulated to fuck, one step at a time."
2021-05-02 16:54:29,stocks,"I think retail investors would get crushed. As fun as it could be, I think large funds who automate their trading would have a new way to further exploit the market"
2021-05-02 12:31:28,stocks,"I’m sorry, I can’t hear you over the sound of my massive erection."
2021-05-02 11:40:57,stocks,"I prefer if they extend the hours from 7-20:00,weekends off.

HFs have huge impact after hours, small investors need opportunity"
2021-05-02 12:16:21,stocks,Feels like it is open 24/7. For the big players.
2021-05-02 14:52:06,stocks,It already is... we just can't trade 24/7.
2021-05-02 13:34:44,stocks,As someone who works the night shift and sleeps during the day. I would love a 24 hour market. Sorry daywalkers.
2021-05-02 15:31:29,stocks,"I would hate it, but the truth is I absolutely believe that it will happen in the next few years. Stock trades will become backed by blockchain technology, and people will be able to trade any stock from anywhere in the world. I think that's a good thing for the market, and liquidity, and investors all around the world, but I do not look forward to there being 24/7 trading. I think the stress would kill me :/"
2021-05-02 12:24:42,stocks,"There's a reason why there's off-time. Significant announcements need to be made when the stock exchange is closed, otherwise people that immediately catch the news and act on it will profit on that information before others can. It's unfair and I think also illegal if you do it as a company, because regular people are working during opening hours of the stock exchange. This is why as an European I dislike the pre- and post-market trading hours, it directly opposes that principle."
2021-05-02 12:11:22,stocks,Instead of 24/7 either let everybody trading during pre-market or nobody. It's bs that a stock drops significantly because of a bad news and I cannot sell until the next day and It have a huge drop.
2021-05-02 12:07:32,stocks,"Blockchain.

Edit: lol boomers downvoting. Get with the times!"
2021-05-02 12:01:17,stocks,Needs to already be open 24/7 and the fact that it isn't is ass backwards.
2021-05-02 11:13:04,stocks,24/7
2021-05-02 12:07:01,stocks,"Eventually it’ll be 24/7 once the system goes blockchain. Unless they block all addresses over a time period. In which case would make it a centralized system. Which defeats the purpose of blockchain.  
  
Plus our market is from 4am to 8pm. 18 hour window. And if you plot market hours / non market hours separately then all the upside has been non market hours, while it’s negative during market hours. See link below

2021-05-02 12:08:36,stocks,No Jim Cramer needs sleep 😆
2021-05-02 12:14:50,stocks,"No. 
I wouldn’t not sleep otherwise."
2021-05-02 12:19:47,stocks,Probably paranoid lol
2021-05-02 12:26:16,stocks,"Terrible, I wouldn't sleep"
2021-05-02 12:28:21,stocks,Depends on which timezone...
2021-05-02 12:35:08,stocks,I don’t sleep as it is.
2021-05-02 13:02:44,stocks,It is open 24/7: ECN
2021-05-02 13:06:49,stocks,Tired.
2021-05-02 13:22:55,stocks,I feel like that would give other parts of the world that trade in the US markets an edge when it comes to reacting to global events while the US is mostly asleep.
2021-05-02 13:27:54,stocks,I wouldn't mind seeing regular trading hours expanded Monday through Friday. Maybe 8am to 5pm. I work the graveyard shift - this would be extremely helpful for me to open and close trades without sacrificing too much sleep.
2021-05-02 13:48:43,stocks,I like having my weekends off
2021-05-02 14:12:35,stocks,I like having some time off to not have to worry about it.
2021-05-02 14:20:33,stocks,Would be great
2021-05-02 14:22:30,stocks,If after market traders also couldn’t trade after closing hell yeah.
2021-05-02 14:33:09,stocks,Sleep deprived...
2021-05-02 14:39:09,stocks,I would develop some serious anxiety
2021-05-02 14:39:17,stocks,"I kinda wish the 4 am premarket thing was ended

Like sure have the premarket at 7:30

But 4am wtf that's 1am for california"
2021-05-02 14:40:52,stocks,If I get a good stock at a good price I worry about nothing
2021-05-02 14:43:03,stocks,"I like trading the open, so I wouldn't be able to do that. Unless the stock market was closed one day of the year, then I'd get to trade the open 1 day out of the year."
2021-05-02 16:13:27,stocks,"No, just no."
2021-05-02 16:17:53,stocks,I’m too stupid to understand the implications of this so it doesn’t bother me
2021-05-02 16:49:14,stocks,*Internet money has entered the chat*
2021-05-02 17:13:37,stocks,it would good. I get bored on the weekends
2021-05-02 18:39:53,stocks,How would you feel about being able to make money two more days every single week? What makes you ask such a rhetorical question? Disgusting.
2021-05-02 18:41:01,stocks,This would make my job hellish.
2021-05-02 18:41:25,stocks,"I think a 24/7 run exchange would tip the scale in favor of funds even more so than it is now, they can afford to have algos, or even have staff 24/7 watching the price action.

Might work out in favor of some retails who are awake in the middle of the night and can catch those opportunities, but for the rest of us as a whole it means we'll be vulnerable 24/7"
2021-05-02 19:14:36,stocks,"No way, too stressful"
2021-05-02 19:22:20,stocks,"I think it'd destroy the market, honestly. Because we'd have to guard our accounts 24 hours a day. And it's virtually impossible to do that, so who would venture the risk?"
2021-05-02 19:40:41,stocks,On exchanges like FTX you can already trade stocks 24/7.
2021-05-02 19:51:06,stocks,"As someone who works swing, nights, weekends abs holidays I’d love this. I miss so much potential."
2021-05-02 11:51:30,stocks,"Great question! I would vote against it, but I sure don’t like this hybrid crap of open between 9:30 and 4:00, with pre-market and post-market when it’s neither open nor closed. Just to create complexity and make it easier for manipulation. Such is life."
2021-05-02 11:57:18,stocks,"Some stocks you can trade 24/7, but even then there's so little volume that it's nearly pointless. I prefer limited hours, makes it easier for everyone"
2021-05-02 12:37:15,stocks,I live in CA. I feel like the operational hours you get in the afternoon is better than mine living in the US.
2021-05-02 15:34:30,stocks,The stock market is open 24hr 6 days a week starts in nz and ends at the us....
2021-05-02 12:30:44,stocks,Great because it's annoying trying to plan my life around whatever time zone it's open in
2021-05-02 12:35:40,stocks,">However, I enjoy the feeling of being able to sleep without the risk of waking up and seeing some stock has crashed 20% overnight.

The premarket still exists."
2021-05-02 13:25:32,stocks,"I think it should be 8AM till 8PM as regular hour, and 8PM till 11 PM as after hour. Mon -Sat are good working schedule. Sunday off."
2021-05-02 14:13:40,stocks,Harder to manipulate....
2021-05-02 14:42:38,stocks,Wouldn't like it open 24/7. The stock market needs a break just like people do.
2021-05-02 12:14:26,stocks,And it gives everyone a break. No need to stress or do much on the weekends except spend time with family and friends
2021-05-02 12:15:50,stocks,Also time to take a few steps back and review your positions and orders.
2021-05-02 11:57:58,stocks,same
2021-05-02 13:01:44,stocks,"I never particularly hated mondays because thankfully I enjoy my work. But yes before investing I was like “meh, Monday’s”. Now I’m like “Sweet, Monday’s!”"
2021-05-02 12:53:27,stocks,"I do squats on Mondays, so I get market open Monday morning and squats In the evening a few hours after market close."
2021-05-02 12:02:18,stocks,100% agree!
2021-05-02 11:28:23,stocks,The weekend is to take a break from cocaine and Bang drinks.
2021-05-02 12:18:00,stocks,"Saturday is now the longest day of the week (it's like a come down from the excitement and high of the trading week) but by Sunday I'm actually kind of enjoying the market not being open because then I can start to feel the mentally relaxation sinking in (and can appreciate it since it's only one more sleep before the market opens again for another week). 

24/7 trading would be fun at first but would exhaust me after a few months. I'm good with how it is now."
2021-05-02 11:32:50,stocks,"Sleep when your dead, we gotta double this bitch."
2021-05-02 11:50:44,stocks,"Exactly why it should be 24/7.

You snooze you lose, LITERALLY!"
2021-05-02 12:43:02,stocks,I dream about charts and red numbers escalating so sleep isn't that restful to me in the first place lol
2021-05-02 11:50:06,stocks,*23/5
2021-05-02 13:16:38,stocks,"To much happens while markers are closed and everyone's powerless to do anything about it. 

Set a stop loss for -$100 for example wake up the next day and see that in premarket you're down -$800 with nothing you can do about it until market opens, at least if the market was 24/7 you could be comfortable knowing your SL will trigger and will but be surpassed."
2021-05-02 19:05:09,stocks,Imagine if a whale high on coke at 3 am in a strip club bought or sold millions of shares for fun. It would move a stock like 5% at least.
2021-05-02 17:46:52,stocks,"Thats the point.

THE WEAK SHALL DIE"
2021-05-02 12:34:21,stocks,Retail can trade extended hours though
2021-05-02 14:09:11,stocks,So you want to fuck me over because I went with a broker that allows premarket/after hours because you didn’t go with a broker that does that? This is why nothing in the world works good.
2021-05-02 11:56:11,stocks,"Barring earnings and special events, pre/post-market hours turn out to be pretty worthless most of the time and the stock will go on to do what it actually wants from 9:30 to 4. I don't feel like I'm missing out anything by not paying attention to prices besides closing one (and in the day if I'm curious)."
2021-05-02 16:27:46,stocks,"You said trading, but then you said investing. Which is it?"
2021-05-02 18:23:05,stocks,"Nah it doesnt hurt me. 

I just sleep on a different schedule or dont sleep at all"
2021-05-02 18:22:41,stocks,Yup
2021-05-02 16:19:39,stocks,Wait is that a real thing? You can’t play world of Warcraft on Tuesday? Is it just for like an hour or....
2021-05-02 17:41:01,stocks,How much of that type of activity exists solely because of the artificial restrictions of trading windows? I could see a situation where if the market was open 24/7 then a lot of that volume would be smoothed out rather than concentrated at two points of the day. I'm in support of keeping the market open 24/7 with as few artificial restrictions as possible
2021-05-02 11:54:44,stocks,"That suggests an alternative. Have it open and close twice per day, for a couple of hours each session."
2021-05-02 18:23:50,stocks,You should only really be paying attention to listen to noise anyway
2021-05-02 13:51:52,stocks,"Exactly what I was thinking. Imagine a company announcing something life-changing for them, and then you’re one of the first to buy and react. Behaving proactively should be rewarded."
2021-05-02 16:25:05,stocks,Opportunity for what? It doesn't really matter what happens after hours. None of that is relevant to you. Just buy and hold. Doesn't matter what the price was at midnight.
2021-05-02 18:24:57,stocks,Lmao
2021-05-02 13:49:10,stocks,"I think it’s actually fair if people can act on new business news immediately. Under the current system, only those with extended trading hours privileges can react to that news. Having everyone be able to access that directly and at any time means those who are proactive get there first, which I think is a fair way."
2021-05-02 12:47:47,stocks,Your broker sucks everybody can trade pre market
2021-05-02 19:42:53,stocks, Thats why I just mentioned that you can already trade stocks 24/7 on exchange like FTX. Boomer Finance needs to learn it one step at a time!!
2021-05-02 16:26:00,stocks,Salad.
2021-05-02 18:25:16,stocks,Letsgooooo to the moon DOGE
2021-05-02 12:21:51,stocks,"When I was younger (I know this will sound like ancient times but I'm actually a millennial), stores were closed on Sundays and usually by 6pm. Workers were home with their families in the evenings and Sundays.

Then one day, one larger chain decided to open Sundays and til 8 or 9 pm. Workers now had to work those hours, and shoppers spread their spending from an 8 hr period into a 12 hr period. They did not spend 50% more money in that 12 hour period, but what *did* happen is that people who might have shopped at store Y shopped at store X instead. Which meant store Y needed to open later and Sundays to keep up.

This whole time, the same $ was spent overall, just spread out more. But by one stupid business trying to take a bigger piece of pie, now everyone had to work longer and more inconvenient hours and the sales/hr dropped off.

Net result was inconvenience for workers and no actual profit motive, save the short term gain one shop made by offering extended hours.

Point is - spread trading over 24 instead of 8 hrs, all we're doing is lessening the impact of a given hr of trading.

Not to mention the ease with which algo systems would fuck the sleeping. Is your trading fully automated? No? Then extended hrs hurts you and helps them."
2021-05-02 17:22:16,stocks,"A ton of things are still batch-processed to allow clearing, settlement, options, and margin to work.

It wouldn't be as simple as just leaving stocks trading all the time.

And holidays are a thing. You couldn't get half of the street to work on Saturday or the other half on Sunday."

2021-05-02 18:08:13,stocks,"Even allowing stop loss/GTC orders to be executed in AH would be a huge improvement. I mean, I get that the lower volume would mean that your actual sell price would vary more significantly from your stop, but I’d rather sell at $80 with a $90 stop than at $50 when the market opens."
2021-05-02 13:14:56,stocks,"There's a difference between having access to extended hours and actually being able to take advantage of it.  Institutions can have multiple shifts, but individuals have to sleep."
2021-05-02 13:44:10,stocks,"Retail has very little access during these hours - IBKR allows this early with Pro, but very few offer that early in the AM.  It’s institution vs institution (retail would give at least some volume)"
2021-05-02 12:44:46,stocks,I agree. I cannot count how many times I have watched a stock diving in pre-market only to skyrocket when the bell rings.
2021-05-02 12:13:59,stocks,"It really should close for lunch, since it's always such a snore anyway."

2021-05-02 13:33:22,stocks,Which platform you suggest then? I'm using Etoro and I saw trading212. Both of these won't allow me trading pre-market

2021-05-02 13:52:28,stocks,You can trade 4am-8pm with most big US brokerages. Hell; I can trade 24 hours a day on a bunch of securities with TDA; all others from 4am-8pm
2021-05-02 13:50:18,stocks,7-9:30 for NYSE is just as useless and retail has access to it. If I could participate in early trading with Questrade I'm sure most legit brokers give you the same access.
2021-05-02 12:57:01,stocks,premarket is great for swing trades though
2021-05-02 13:45:08,stocks,It's actually a decent time to day trade.
2021-05-02 13:04:35,stocks,touché !
2021-05-02 15:43:46,stocks,Very few can trade at 4am [according to this](https://www.brokerage-review.com/online-brokers/extended-hours-trading.aspx).  Sure you can “place the order” but it won’t actually go live until the times listed.
2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Market creeping downward? I got into stocks about 8 months ago, and made myself a pretty penny after a lot of very lucky picks. 
I started at $200, at now at $3300, with sticking to my original goal of turning $200 into $100,000. (Far stretch obviously, but I enjoy playing without putting significant skin in the game) I got a 401k and several CD’s and Roth IRA for that, so this is a game for me. 

But onto the point, as of the past month, I’ve seen everything plummet, and now the nasdaq is beginning to follow suit, is this normal? Everything seems to have come to a screeching halt, and hasn’t really made any real moves. 

Now I know this happens, but something feels odd, when my entire watch list (50+ different stocks ranging in price from $100-.035) have no significant changes despite good news and catalyst. 
What I’m asking is, could this stock market climb we watched before be coming to an end?
Thoughts?"
2021-05-02 10:42:57,stocks,Market is taking a pause before rocketing to the moon or it’s just the beginning of a huge crash or it moves sideways and we have a lost decade. Nobody knows anybody telling you that the know is a liar or a complete moron. Yes this is normal
2021-05-02 11:02:52,stocks,"Take a look at historical returns and temper your expectations. The timing of your entry into the market was lucky. Returns over the past year are unsustainable and have tricked investors like you to expect such high returns consistently. In actuality, historical 7-10% annualized U.S. equity returns are unlikely to materialize over the next 10-20 years given the current level of the interest rates, lower expected real GDP growth, and a third thing since that flows better."
2021-05-02 15:26:27,stocks,"The market's in an itsy bitsy little gully right now. It's like everybody said, ""OK that was crazy, let's just all calm down."" It's just the gully. Just nerves."
2021-05-02 10:36:47,stocks,"Market is severely overbought. Pumped by imaginary GDP to debt numbers. Propped stimulus. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if we entered a real bear market soon. A lot of political nonsense as well. 

I think we’ll see a bear market or sideways trading here."
2021-05-02 10:36:40,stocks,Yes
2021-05-02 11:49:55,stocks,There's some turmoil now with uncertainty on government policy regarding tax rates bond yield rates interest rates etc. Once the policies are enacted and a stable set of rules are known things will stabilize and grow. Just hold and wait.
2021-05-02 10:46:49,stocks,"I am aware of this, just curious on opinions from experienced traders. It seems so odd though that after having so many spot on picks, almost no losses, then suddenly everything I’m in, or thought of being in, is down, and staying there. 
When I saw the nasdaq finally starting to show this that got my wondering if this severely overvalued market is coming to a close, and these new down numbers are officially the real numbers."
2021-05-02 11:07:56,stocks,"Thank you for your input, and I agree. I am 100% luck. I’m trying to understand as much as I can and learn as much as I can, so I invest carefully, and usually take my .20 cent profit and run.

From the tease arch I’ve done, (not a professional, by far) my prediction the market will be at its lowest in September. Will it come back enough to break even or turn a profit before then? Damn I hope so. And throw all the crazy political stuff on top this it seems we are accelerating towards another crash, which everyone knows, but no one knows when. 
So what would be a safeguard? Mutual funds?
Real estate?"
2021-05-02 12:01:29,stocks,"There were many bad months and scary times in the last ten years, but market went up.

2021-05-02 10:57:32,stocks,What crazy political stuff?
2021-05-02 11:01:37,stocks,How about 5t of debt fundedgovt spending while artificially keeping inflation low.
2021-05-02 11:05:03,stocks,"Stimulus checks the country can’t afford, record breaking spending, there’s a lot but I don’t want this post to become political. 
In a nutshell, my state alone has pissed away a large fortune in oil money and now has nothing to show for it, and taxes went up by 1/4% of the original, despite the mass state income.
A lot of horrible decisions on state and national levels that are highly obvious they are not sustainable. 
What I’m saying is it’s not going to be a recession this time, it will be a depression."
2021-05-02 19:54:21,stocks,But Biden will straighten that out right?
2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Let's talk II-VI Inc. ($IIVI) So I recently came across this company which looked quite interesting to me, given the large variety of usecases for their technologies in growing sectors. I'll try myself at a little writeup to provide some context and serve as a basis for discussion. I'd love to get some opinions and CC from more experienced traders, since this is my first time researching a stock.

So IIVI defines itself as follows:

>""II-VI Incorporated is a global leader in  engineered materials, optoelectronic components and optical systems  offering vertically integrated solutions for applications in industrial,  communications, aerospace & defense, life sciences, semiconductor  capital equipment, automotive and consumer electronics."" (taken from their [website](https://ii-vi.com/))

 Their [customers](https://csimarket.com/stocks/markets_glance.php?code=IIVI) are names like Apple, Facebook and Boeing, among others.

Looking at their financials, they seem to be doing alright. Given their numerous [acquisitions](https://tracxn.com/d/acquisitions/acquisitionsbyII-VI-Incorporated), with a pretty significant recent purchase of Coherent (COHR), an increase in revenue as well as accumulating debt mid-term is to be expected. (data taken from [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IIVI/financials?p=IIVI))

* steadily growing revenue, gross profits and free cashflow
* continuously beat earnings expectations for past 4 quarters

but also increasing debt, and a relatively bad 2020, with a negative EPS of -0.79. 

As mentioned, IIVI has recently acquired COHR, rendering them the leader in the laser technology sector. 

The closing price of IIVI was 67$ on friday, which is a 33% discount from ATH. They had dropped previsously during the COHR acquisition bidding wars, but had temporarily recovered up to 83$ after winning them. Current downwards movement is likely caused by uncertainty regarding their upcoming earnings call on May 6th.

I see potential for a pretty decent recovery mid- to long-term, granted that currently the growth and innovative tech sectors are not looking to hot.

Thanks for reading, and please do feel free to drop your opinions on the stock and this post :)"
2021-05-02 09:44:55,stocks,"A friend of mine has a lot of this stock because his grandma’s estate left it to him (lady had one hell of a financial advisor) and he and I talk stocks a lot so I learned a little bit about this company last year.

The Coherent purchase was big but they had to outbid Lumentum to do it, so I agree that debt could be a big drag in the medium-term. The company was doing well but competition in lasers and robotics has been heating up so I think the Coherent merger could be a make-or-break bet for II-VI. I think if you can understand why they went after Coherent so hard you could get a lot more comfortable with that stock, either way"
2021-05-02 11:15:15,stocks,I like this company vs LITE and COHR. Good buy if it dips below $60 next week.
2021-05-02 09:43:55,stocks,Not a bad company. I was in it for a year. Bought at $33 cashed out in Feb when it went to $99.
2021-05-02 14:37:38,stocks,"Where da jazz pianists at?

ii V I"
2021-05-02 09:55:27,stocks,"Yeah that's a good point, thank you"
2021-05-02 11:38:36,stocks,Could you elaborate on what sets it apart from the other two?
2021-05-02 13:59:21,stocks,"Agree, $60 good price (also for PINS, as an aside)"
2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Short volume on stock tickers I feel it’s unfair for shorts to have all the data to make a valued pick for shorting, they have our volume, 52 week high/low. Daily high/low and loads of other information. However, the only thing we don’t get in return is short volume and a constant idea of what it is. We have to look at dark pools, look at the 15 day old report of short interest. It’s highly unfair that bulls are getting shafted. Shorts can buy on leverage, bulls gotta pay full price."
2021-05-02 09:11:35,stocks,"Bulls can also just buy and hold without having to pay anything on interest. Big Institutionals are going to have the data, technology, and collusion in order to build themselves the biggest edge possible, but shorting is high risk, so them having this tools isn’t too big of a deal because it can be doom if they make a bad read. Fundamentally sound companies shouldn’t have to worry about shorts though. If enough people get behind a stock, the company sells a good product, and/or management is at the top of their game defending against these bearish forces of the market, those listed advantages isn’t going to be as strong as time goes on.

In a nutshell, while shorts are encouraged to have the most advantage possible, the nature of the risk is that if bulls collectively bet against you, you eventually run out of Aces to pull out of the sleeve or rabbits to pull out of the hat."
2021-05-02 09:43:36,stocks,"Not a big fan of harping on fairness, expecting it has cost this naive soul more than money.  You’re totally right though that information is key and we’re ideally supposed to have an “efficient” market, most crucial for which is equal and efficient information for participants. Obviously that ideal is ions away from reality and is made worse by so many fallacies being propagated.  That, and of course fear and greed sentiment, is why the market is not efficient.  You have a choice to either stay out or figure a way to use it to your advantage. Good luck."
2021-05-02 11:40:19,stocks,"I guess the at might be true but fundamentals don’t always matter in these markets. You can buy and hold apple for the year, but have zero growth. I guess you could buy and hold Apple for 5 years. There are just so many overpriced stocks that have zero product, but people are already speculating for 2-5 years out. Look at QS... you can own part of the next generation battery that might not exist."
2021-05-02 09:23:30,stocks,"Yes I can understand that, what penalties do they pay? During the gme squeeze they was given money they lost, so it seems like a win win for hedges to short without consequences."
2021-05-02 14:44:43,stocks,"Does QS has a product or experience they are putting out that has significant market potential or sales? Does QS provide a unique experience to consumers? How globally recognized is their brand or management team? Speculation on tickers that don’t offer a product, have a moat, market a unique brand, and a many other factors isn’t my cup of tea. If people want to make a 5 year out bet on companies that will either make significant profits or completely bust, that’s on other people to do with their warchest. All I’m saying is stocks that offer good products, have good leadership, and have tangible profitability or an easily digestible business model probably won’t be subject to shorting tactics.

Shorting the entire market is a bold move in theory, but, you need to guess it correctly on an investment where you can face some hefty losses. What tickers people yeet their cash at is truly a marvel."
2021-05-02 12:13:16,stocks,"I get it. You’re frustrated. I am too as an AMC bagholder. Problem is, no one who can do actually things and make changes give an iota of a damn about what’s happening with these stocks. I fall into the camp that the stock market will never be fair, and our “regulators” are the banks or big firms with the ability to margin call or go long on a position to deny shorts the ability to keep up their antics. At the end of the day, stay away from overpriced companies when it comes to a sizable percentage of your portfolio, manage your risk tolerance, and believe in averaging down, buying and holding."
2021-05-02 11:55:56,stocks,"Who got what paid? I'm not sure what you are referring to. While the state can help out banks and the market, and this is necessary to keep the concept alive, the burn was quite deep on the amount that was put in."
2021-05-02 15:13:56,stocks,"Why is it that the price to earnings ratio does not matter? Why are less companies paying dividends, planning to pay dividends, or doing stock buy backs. It’ll the fundamental of owning a share is that you are eligible for some compensation when the company has great profits... but it seems that people are just buying stocks to store value and meanwhile the companies are just stockpiling their assets and not giving back to their investors. It’s all very Ponzi-esque only purpose of holding stocks is to hopefully sell it to another bag holder later on..."
2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Query regarding selling shares? Hi guys, quick Q. My mum inherited shares a number of years ago and is looking to offload them now. We are confused with how much we can sell them for; it says ordinary shares = 0.027p but on the LSE it says 113p. Can someone shed some light? Thanks in advance 👍"
2021-05-02 08:04:09,stocks,What’s the company ? How many shares ?

# **More earnings, April’s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> April’s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.
*****
> Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.
*****
> “Since November, there’s been a 30% rally,” said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. “There’s the adage ‘sell in May, go away.’ It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we’ve done so well in the last six months.”
*****
> # Big jobs report
> April’s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.
*****
> Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.
*****
> According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.
*****
> Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for “substantial further progress” in its goals for the economy.
*****
> The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.
*****
> “Next week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed’s path to ‘substantial progress’ on their two roles, we’ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed’s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.
*****
> The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.
*****
> Just days after Powell’s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.
*****
> The market’s focus on the Fed’s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.
*****
> “If this jobs number comes in super hot, it’s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.
*****
> Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.
*****
> # Earnings soar
> So far, a record 87% of S&P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&P 500 based on strong earnings. “We are raising our 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,” he wrote.
*****
> Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.
*****
> A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife. (A calendar with some key earnings dates appears below.)
*****
> Chang said the market has discounted a lot of the positive news already.
*****
> “In spite of the really strong reports from the bellwether companies, you’re seeing some of the names starting to peter out a little bit,” said Chang. “I think it’s a sign that so much good news is discounted. I suspect the market is due for a breather. I think in the next couple of months, we’re likely to see sideways movement. There’s likely to be a pullback which will be healthy.”
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 5.2% in April, finishing Friday at 4,181. It is now up 11.2% for the year so far. The Dow rose 2.7% in April, to 33,874, and the Nasdaq gained 5.4% in April, ending Friday at 13,962.
*****
> Chang said he expects some of the “boring” blue chips that haven’t participated as much in the rally to do better. Some of those names can be found in pharma, he said.
*****
> Heading into the coming week, investors will be watching for words of wisdom from Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting Saturday.

> # S&P 500 and DJIA Up Last 9 Post-Election Year Mays

> May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.

> May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

> In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.

> Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.

> # S&P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months – Preceded Flat May to late-October

> As of yesterday’s close, S&P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).

> In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is “All Years,” “Post-Election Years,” and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don’t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.

> # Here Comes Sell In May

> “The sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you’re one month on in the middle of May.” American Poet Robert Frost

> One of the best known investment axioms is to “sell in May and go away.” This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “Stocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we’d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.”

> Here’s the catch, isn’t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.

> # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021

> In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus—including direct payments to consumers—and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption—the largest portion of GDP.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960’s:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “The U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,” added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Many areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don’t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.”

> However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn’t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.

> Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

> The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.

> We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5–5.5% to 6.25–6.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.

> # Where Do President Biden’s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?

> President Biden’s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.

> We’ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term “hundred days” was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.

> Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, “President Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn’t have many issues with him.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden’s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.

> Here’s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.

> What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn’t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.

> # Wild Data Close To Q1

> Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.

> First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**

> The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as ""stimulus checks"" or even shorter: ""stimmies.""

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**

> Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**

> With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-4.png))**

> For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.

Also thank you for the write up, very informative."
2021-05-02 15:02:59,stocks,"Thank you sir. I think Twilio will crush, not beat, but crush their earnings. We will see a good healthy bump from their acquisition of Segment and also sms usage for companies increased. Real estate being a huge one actually this year. Either way, I see Twilio beating their expectations, exceeding their 30% realistic qoq increase and having a positive eps."

Voyager Digital spiked 18% at close on Friday, leaving me up 23.5% in that position since getting back into it two weeks ago. I’m anticipating some level of profit taking, but as a long term holder, I’m mostly curious to see if it establishes new support."

2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,Anyone else waiting on the inevitable market crash?  I feel like i am at a crossroad right now. I already have 50k in the  market with 10k cash just...waiting. I want to spend this cash like  crazy when the market tanks and make some good opportunity in smart  returns. I am mostly a long term investor so only a small part of my  portfolio gets sold. Anyone else in this waiting period?
2021-05-02 03:10:35,stocks,"I waited for the crash 2015, 2016 .... It never came and I missed some good opportunities because I held more cash than I should.

Will a crash come? Absolutely yes.  Will it come this year? Maybe...

I learned my lesson:
Time in the market > timing the market."
2021-05-02 03:44:02,stocks,"I’ve been feeling this exact same way. If you look at the 10Y graph for a stock like AAPL, you’ll see that the growth experienced since the pandemic started is way faster than before. It’s the same case for many other stocks.

I think this can be attributed to more people taking up the stock market as a hobby, and more people buying more shares will increase the price.

The unfortunate truth is that many of these new investors will likely sell at the first sign of a crash, so if and when we see another correction of sectors such tech, I think that’s when the true downfall will come.

I think it will likely be more of a correction than a crash, and that it may be limited to just certain sectors rather than the entire market as a whole."
2021-05-02 06:24:56,stocks,I know when crash will happen. End of august. Right before stimulus/unemployment runs out. There will be a 40% correction. My magic 8 ball told me so.
2021-05-02 03:08:56,stocks,"I’m waiting on buying overvalued tech companies, I have been buying value stocks/commodities.  

Who knows, everyone is making money right now, can’t wait on the sidelines."
2021-05-02 05:07:00,stocks,"I am expecting a correction sometime in Q2 2021 primarily because of higher anticipated inflation. To hedge the weakening USD’s bearish outlook, I want to think that several funds would rebalance to allocate a good portion of their portfolios to commodities because they are inversely tied to USD’s performance (have you looked at how undervalued commodities are vs the broader market today? Check this out: https://www.etftrends.com/alternatives-channel/are-commodities-setting-up-for-a-2021-bull-market/). This rebalance would mean that money will be pulled out of defensives in favor of cyclicals. This should hurt overvalued stocks, especially in the tech sector, and could offer a buying opportunity for long term investors.

Is there a way to tell when to buy? I usually enter the market when the fear vs greed index is in the red: https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/ 

<Insert Buffett’s famous quote here>

This is not financial advice. I am full of shit and simply talking out of my ass."
2021-05-02 03:07:28,stocks,Look like they going up not down
2021-05-02 03:41:26,stocks,"What you are doing is good since you practicing self control, but if this market crash you waiting for comes we can be talking 5 years recession, hard to know who will come up victorious in that period"
2021-05-02 03:27:03,stocks,Predicting a crash is some next level shit. If you’re holding 50k and have 10k dry. Why not just swing trade the 10k and stay super unattached to the bets you take with the 10. If you see the market correcting dump what you have in the 10.
2021-05-02 03:05:33,stocks,No.
2021-05-02 03:15:28,stocks,"50k and 10k is a good cash to investment ratio, no? You do realize that after pretty much every crash has been a recovery later that eventually surpassed greatly the previous highs even?  The market is at all time highs, and even if it goes down, given time everything has risen.  Chill, and assume that if there’s a string of red days in a row, its actually just a great time to buy."
2021-05-02 04:21:03,stocks,"Not bothered to be honest, i'm set in long positions lastimg decades, so a crash if anything just means more opportunity to load up on cheap shares."
2021-05-02 04:56:13,stocks,"If you're sitting on a large amount of cash and would prefer to get in at a lower price, one option would be to sell cash-covered puts on securities that you like. Either they drop to the price you want them and you can buy, or you collect the premium for waiting."

2021-05-02 06:48:20,stocks,"Holding some percentage of my portfolio in cash will do miracle.

if something inevitable happens."
2021-05-02 09:40:45,stocks,"Well overdue for a pullback, but when governments worldwide are printing and dumping money into systems it can’t/won’t crash..."
2021-05-02 13:19:57,stocks,"You need only to question if the stocks/companies you chose will go bankrupt. If the answer is no and you still like them then a market crash means nothing except for fantastic buying opportunities across the board. You should always have liquidity and should not invest your entire worth. The market will always be back and go higher. Additionally the market isn't going to crash, but I wish it would."
2021-05-02 06:23:45,stocks,I am not waiting. The rebound after covid started another bull market that will likely last years again. The greater risk is being left behind.
2021-05-02 03:12:14,stocks,Honestly a good philosophy. i am continuing to buy into the market every week but i am fortunate enough to have cash sitting. i might splurge in one sitting but i did that in feb 2020 and i just facepalmed myself for how stupid the timing was
2021-05-02 06:42:41,stocks,"If you are able to recall, I am curious to know what catalysts were in play in 2015/2016 that made you think that there was going to be a crash back then?"
2021-05-02 03:47:30,stocks,interesting read. thank you for this. Yeah it could be a correction of the super overweight stocks like TESLA and others that have absurd P/E ratios. My dividend long term stocks will be perfectly fine in the storm. i sold out of the super high growth stocks that made me a good chunk of change so now i am just waiting
2021-05-02 13:23:15,stocks,We already had a correction
2021-05-02 06:25:18,stocks,Ask again Later

2021-05-02 03:08:42,stocks,Yeah but I feel like a correction is about to happen. So many companies have high P/E ratios and are super overpriced vs their actual company performance
2021-05-02 03:10:40,stocks,I’m looking at the correction to be going up not down if things are opening up and some will be but to much 🤷🏽‍♂️just a baby 🦍
2021-05-02 05:57:50,stocks,It's much easier to see which are the good companies in a recession though.
2021-05-02 03:29:46,stocks,i mean 10k is still too much for me to YOLO. maybe if i had close to 500k i would feel confident in myself to do that
2021-05-02 03:06:11,stocks,explain. what are you thinking about the market conditions right now?
2021-05-02 03:18:13,stocks,I know but i do want to spend more than usual when i see a string of red. Taking advantage of discounts for the long run. I hate seeing good cash just sit like a turd and do nothing
2021-05-02 05:56:21,stocks,Whatever happened to be fearful when others are greedy ?
2021-05-02 03:19:44,stocks,"Just remember there were millions and millions of Americans that sat on cash instead of buying in February or January or December of ‘19 or any month before. Today you’re sitting in a much better position in terms of % returns than they are because you were at least in the game. 


Something to keep in mind with regards to the main question you’re asking in this thread."
2021-05-02 03:44:11,stocks,"Another thing I do, never invest everything at once. I do it at least in three sperate orders distributed over few weeks or months (longest was 6months, shortest three weeks). How long I take depends on the circumstances.

E.g. if I truly think a stock is undervalued and I see a decline, I go in faster if I think there are no fundamental reasons for the decline. The fastest I went in was Nel ASA when their h2 station blew up.

Edit: my goal with this is, to make.sure that I will never hit the worst time to invest. But also it will also prevent me from hitting the best time by luck. But that's ok for me."

2021-05-02 03:12:06,stocks,There’s been enough studies to prove that you’re better off getting your money in the market quickly and regularly than trying to time the dip
2021-05-02 03:13:40,stocks,You are right even with record earns it still doesn’t justify the prices
2021-05-02 06:10:59,stocks,Why?
2021-05-02 10:45:50,stocks,"Part of the reason for Buffett and BRKs success is money management.  They keep a fair amount of liquidity to better be able to buy when there are opportunities.  It changed my mind on my own money management, though I still use all the moneys in Robinhood to invest (but not in other investment accounts)."
2021-05-02 19:25:17,stocks,Its better than seeing it decrease by 8% a day/week..
2021-05-02 10:27:58,stocks,Every. Single. Crash.   During the COVID crisis were a number of businesses people thought would go out of business that are now at valuations that made no sense pre covid.  Freaking out is silly.
2021-05-02 03:13:38,stocks,I get your point. i sold a lot of my overvalued stocks but kept the good ones i know are gonna do well for long term. sold mostly tech stocks because they are super overpriced IMO
2021-05-02 06:14:39,stocks,Because weak companies get into much worse trouble in recessions. Hard times make it clear who has good management and a resilient business model. Because of that it is much easier to invest smartly during recessions.
2021-05-02 03:14:27,stocks,What are you basing their values on?
2021-05-02 06:18:01,stocks,This is such a linear way to lose money and opportunities. How do you know that company X that is doing poorly during the recession is not going to get bought by a bigger company making its stock skyrocket? I understand what you mean but nothing changes in a recession except some stocks are cheaper. You will still miss out on that one stock you put on your list and forgot and only saw again when it made a x10.
2021-05-02 03:15:43,stocks,P/E ratios and the returns were way too high compared to other years. i had a feeling it would correct soon. many tech stocks are super high right now
2021-05-02 06:19:57,stocks,"I didn't say that you should *only* invest during recessions. You can certainly invest in acquisition and other distressed asset plays, but that requires a specific type of analysis.

I have a global macro thesis when investing in a market and asset class, before looking at individual company specifics."
2021-05-02 03:23:49,stocks,"What is a P/E ratio?
Sorry im new."
2021-05-02 03:24:37,stocks,Price to earnings ratio
2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Compound interest formula help I'm just looking for a bit of clarity on compound interest.

Let's say I buy a stock at X price, it goes up, and I sell it a Y price, then it comes back down and I buy in again at Z price (somewhere in between X and Y).

Is there a formula to work out how much lower Z has to be than Y, how much higher Z has to be than X, how much of the total sale (Y) i have to reinvest, or how much of an increase there was between X and Y to work out when compounding is more profitable than just holding X all along?

I hope this makes sense"
2021-05-02 03:16:22,stocks,"I think I understand what you are asking and it seems like three concepts are cross mojinated. Compound interest applies to interest bearing bank accounts and is essentially interest earned on interest over time creating a Compound effect.

Dollar Cost Averaging is buying a stock high, low, over time to normalize price. 

Value or swing trades are buying low, selling high in essence, if you do a lot of this with one stock, you will likely hit a wash sale penalty or other tags.

Read into each of these concepts and I think you will find what you are looking for."
2021-05-02 06:52:15,stocks,"Compounding can work manually as well, as how you are saying above. 

There's never have been a formula, what i do is go with instinct, if i still see the value in their company (preferably by seeing their growth and demand ), then i definitely buy the stock at discounted prices."
2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Earnings starting 5/3, good or bad? Looks like the first week of earnings were a wild ride. We had apple kind of go up, but then back down. Then we saw Tesla go down then go back up. We had Twitter sink, amd rise. Every stock actually still did pretty good, yet not all stocks rose. 

This week we have another week with lots of good names reporting earnings. We’ve got lots of companies like Fastly, Square and Roku. I’m most looking forward to PayPal and Twilio. Both of those are going to crush earnings and have a good upside. Thoughts?"
2021-05-02 01:20:54,stocks,"Unfortunately, positive earnings are not necessarily guaranteed to show a rise in stock price. Much of the market appears to be overvalued by historical standards of P/E ratios and the like. 

However, I wouldn’t be too discouraged by negative price action as long as the company’s report is positive and seems to be exceeding expectations."
2021-05-02 07:49:01,stocks,AMD and AAPL had a great earning only to see all the gains wiped out within hours of next day open.
2021-05-02 13:40:12,stocks,"Some people predict a compression of PE this year. I think they're right. Earnings indeed have gone up to get the PE closer to their historical value. But stock price might not move much (aside from the usual volatility around earnings). 

The next significant leg for the market I care about is probably what the US and other major countries will do for the wider world when it comes to vaccination. I hope that we come to our senses and start selling out vaccine at cost or for a small profit. US vaccination rate is already slowed due to the remaining population's unwillingness to take the vaccine: so we should sell it to other countries who actually need it. Rising tide lift all boats and a vaccinated India and China will provide powerful fuel for the next phase of economic growth. Their manufacturing capability will also stabilize the price for our consumer's goods such as timber, steel, etc."
2021-05-02 08:35:56,stocks,"I think your are fine in PYPL. Buy a little now and, if it goes down after earnings, buy a little more cheaper.

2021-05-02 01:22:21,stocks,"This! Earnings mean nothing in this current market, good news seems to have the opposite effect for some weird reason"
2021-05-02 11:41:06,stocks,Both are growing at crazy rates and are such a steal at these dipped prices. Especially AMD where they have said to expect 50% growth this year and the price is still at the same place it’s been for almost a year. It’s gonna have to correct upwards and soon
2021-05-02 14:44:48,stocks,"Yeah, companies are overvalued without showing their actual progress is accelerating faster than they predicted. It’s not about beating earnings, but crushing them. I do think Twilio will crush theirs. New acquisitions, api usage and sms are only getting more heavily used in companies than not. I don’t see that slowing down. They’re the front runner for the industry, yet still haven’t captured majority of the audience. Lots of room to grow, especially since accelerating tech adoption in 2020"
2021-05-02 01:48:51,stocks,"Yeah I agree, it’s not about just good earnings, I’m talking about exceeding expectations. I believe Twilio still has lots of market share to gain, and upsell, and they’re exceed their earnings as usual and we can see and upswing of 4-5%. And then we have PayPal which is starting to be in the crypto world which will open the doors to much more money. I can see a 2-5% bump for them too. Anyways, you’re right though, because earnings beat isn’t the win, but I think these two are companies will beat expectations and raise guidance."
2021-05-02 12:58:37,stocks,"yeah, I find it strange amd is trading near $81 again after their current earnings... Hoping it dips below $80 to swoop up another 1000 shares..."
2021-05-02 02:10:23,stocks,"What is your guidance price though and why? It’s not an easy question to answer necessarily and that’s the art of investing. Companies that are demonstrating solid growth may very well deserve to be priced in at a higher P/E ratio, but what is that for you and why? 

It’s largely rhetorical, but I’m just trying to highlight the importance of having a process/methodology when assessing companies. And to measure that process’ success or failure over time."
2021-05-02 13:40:25,stocks,Definitely a solid investment
2021-05-02 15:54:12,stocks,"Dont be so sure it will dip below 80. Nonetheless, if it does I might take out a personal loan to load up..."
2021-05-02 02:27:52,stocks,"Yeah for sure. SMS is a multi billion dollar firm. It’s worth a few billion, of course, not anything crazy. But, Twilio itself is at a rev of 500+ mil, and that includes all their services. Guidance wise, I see their stock entering the 500 range in the next couple years. I believe they’re already priced pretty high, but I see good projections for YOY growth. It’s not Tesla of course, but I do see lots of progress with their suite of products like sms, sendgrid, segment...all of these have just scratched the surface with rev. I do see segment doing a 50-60% increase this quarter with upsell. And then I see increased competition as a good thing. Helps to drive adoption. I have more to say, but I’m a little busy right now. But I def don’t see SMS going anywhere anytime soon, only increased usage with everyone glued to their mobile device."
2021-05-02 17:40:48,stocks,if it dips to $78 I will post my purchase order of 1000 shares lol

2021-05-02 19:41:54,stocks,"I'd caution against thinking that oil will go up substantially from $60/barrel for a sustained period of time in the foreseeable future just because demand will rise again during summer. The price at this depressed demand is currently driven by OPEC+'s limiting its output. At $60 fracking begins to be profitable and OPEC+ doesn't like that. An increase in demand can be outmatched by an increase in output by any combination of countries in OPEC+ and other major oil producers. All in all, I don't like my investing money to be dependent on the whims of OPEC+. Remember that both Russia and OPEC are itching to increase its output to balance their budgets."

RDS.B is traded in U.K., and U.K. has much more favorable tax treatment for US citizens. So you don’t have to pay taxes on dividends. 

There are some other differences though. I believe that if the company goes bankrupt RDS.A shareholders get paid first. It isn’t a concern to me but something to consider. And I believe for that reason RDS.A is traded a bit higher so RDS.B is on a slight discount.

I'm hoping they do well because the quality of people they hire has historically been high, among other reasons. If they weren't pivoting  I'd be looking to get out in the next couple of years, and probably not buying in anymore after this low. Wouldn't want to invest in an ultimately declining product market."

See lines 12-19, 61-65 of CA 2020 Form 540. *The California income tax return basically just takes the adjusted gross income from the federal income tax return, applies some adjustments, adds some taxes such as use taxes, and applies taxes already paid.*

2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,Looking for a new brokerage I currently use TD Ameritrade and I am very happy with them. My only issue is I want to be able to buy fractional shares by entering in the dollar amount I want to buy (not the share amount.) The only other requirement is I want to set up auto withdraw from my bank account WEEKLY. I checked out fidelity and Schwab and neither let me auto transfer money every week. Any suggestions. Also no Robinhood! I appreciate any suggestions.
2021-05-01 22:55:14,stocks,I think M1 finance does what you are looking for.
2021-05-01 23:25:47,stocks,"So I might be somewhat qualified to answer this as I currently have accounts open at TD, Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard and M1.   Long story as to why, but a lot of it has been searching for the right account for my investing style.

What I have found is that I like each one for different reasons, but ones which are relevant to you:

If you want fractional shares, then pretty much you're limited to Fidelity or M1.   Schwab does fractional shares, but only for companies in the S&P 500 and no ETFs.   Interactive brokers is also an option but I don't have an open account over there, and they typically cater to more active traders so I can't provide much information.  I'm sure there are smaller ones out there, but I don't think I'd venture out beyond the ones I mentioned above.

Really I think the option comes down to your investment style - M1 is better for long-term investments which are 'ratio driven'.   For instance:  ""Every week, pull X dollars from my checking account, and then invest automatically to try to maintain a ratio of 60% VTI and 40% VXUS"".    You can manually trade, but the free service only has one trade window - basically all previously-entered trades (including the automatic ones) execute in a window that opens at market open each day and ends when all of the trades are done.    This is fine for long-term investing, not so great if you're trying to time the market.

Fidelity is more of a hands-on approach.  And is better if you're actually buying and selling interactive stocks.   I know some people have gotten around the transfer issue you mention by setting up a monthly schedule on say the 1st, 7th, 14th and 21st.   Doesn't make it consistent as far as which day it comes out, and there will often be a missing week at the end of the month.   Another thing to look into is whether you can push money to fidelity from your checking account (perhaps to a fidelity cash management account?) instead of pulling."
2021-05-01 22:39:27,stocks,"I have fidelity and you are allowed to set up your account to have auto withdraws (not exactly sure if it’s weekly or bi-weekly) but the only thing is, you have to submit a request for the “upgrade” and they may accept or decline request."

I do this for my mortgage and have $50 a day withdrawn from my account even though they only allow for weekly payments.  In this case I have 7 transfers setup starting on Mon, Tues, Wed. etc. when I first setup the transfer schedule. Works wonderfully, just remember, your Sunday payment will lag so you normally see two deposits on Tues.

While trading has gotten cheaper or free, this type of fee has likely gone up, not down. Also you should expect it to not be a quick and painless process because almost no one does this anymore so the odds aren’t in your favor of finding someone who knows all the steps and can just do it without looking up some obscure instruction manual that may or may not be up to date."

There are just so many dividend growth companies on my watchlist that I didn’t know where to start. Initially I was wanting to do a write up on HanesBrands, ticker $HBI, due to everyone needing underwear and socks but then I realized I hadn’t put on underwear since I got home from work on Friday, so I just couldn’t bring myself to break that streak to product test this company as thoroughly as I would have liked. However, this did lead me to throwing away some older underwear from the back of my drawer and having to race out to get them in the bin before the truck picked up this morning. Funnily enough, it was this little act that led me down the rabbit hole of America's first, largest, and objectively best waste management company, $WM. This write up will attempt to go over some of the reasons I view $WM as a prime choice for any dividend growth investor who is seeking to add to their industrial holdings by buying a company worth holding for 20+ years, including some basic financial information, how WM can grow into the future, as well as some potential problems with the stock that I see. Finally I am not a financial advisor and this is written purely for the purpose of sharing some publicly available stock info in the form of a poorly written, weed induced WM DD, I hope you enjoy.

The aptly named Waste Management, ticker symbol $WM, is an industrial sector powerhouse with first mover-advantage specializing in the waste management sub-sector that has been slowly and steadily raising its dividend over the last 18 years. Waste Management operates primarily with four different revenue streams consisting of waste collection, landfill operations, waste transportation, and finally, recycling. It is with these four primary sources of revenue that allow $WM to boast a current dividend yield of 1.68% with a yearly dividend of $2.30 paid out quarterly in March, June, September, and December. This dividend represents a payout ratio of only 53% which is not very high at all and is actually very sustainable. In fact, it has a dividend safety score of 98 from simplysafedividends.com and is over where management is aiming for their dividend to be (between 40-50% according to their 2020 Investors day presentation.) In addition to being very sustainable, a payout ratio of 53% also leaves room for growth, and $WM has been doing just that. While it's 4 year average dividend yield is just slightly higher at 1.98% compared to todays at 1.68% the amount that yield represents has been growing at an average rate of 41.46% over the last 5 years, 28.24% over the last 3 years, and even in the shitstorm that was 2020, WM raised its dividend by 6.34% just showing that this company not only cares about it's dividend growth, but that it can easily afford to raise its dividend as one important thing to note is that during the last 18 years (since 2004) of consistent dividend increases, the payout ratio has more or less remained unchanged, maintaining managements preferred 40-50% payout ratio  with occasional outbreaks such as where we are currently due to a contagious outbreak that rocked the entire world. Finally, Waste Management has a Current Price of ≅ $138, an analyst price range of $125-$160, and an average analyst price target of $144 showing some room for this stock to still raise or fall to a better entry point if it does fall to test the lower analysts prediction. 

Moving on from the dividend and surface level stock price breakdowns, $WM has a current P/E ratio of 37.7 and I know this might seem very high, it actually isn't when you compare it to other waste management companies. For instance, WM’s next three largest competitors are Republic Services, with a P/E of 35.2, Clean Harbor, with a P/E of 36.7, and Waste Connections, which has a huge P/E of 141.13 (this is the only one of the three that I went and checked multiple sites and yes, it really is that big...) As you can see, a P/E ratio in the low to mid 30’s basically comes with the territory of being in the waste management sub-sector. Just as the P/E ratio comes with the sub-sector; growth in the form of acquisitions will almost always bring some additional debt as its +1, and this is the next aspect of $WM’s balance sheet that I want to touch on. In 2019 Waste Management achieved a major milestone for any company, it officially made enough to fully pay down it's yearly short term debt and pay off future long term debt, an achievement it had not completed since at least 2016 (and possibly before but this is the furthest back I could find regarding short term debt payments). Regardless, this is still an important feat as it shows that $WM is making enough money to support not only a growing dividend, but also additional amounts of debt to fund new acquisitions now and in the future. Now how can I make the claim that they can afford to take even more debt on? Well in 2020 (yeah the shitiest of shity years for businesses) $WM paid off all their short term debt and an additional $7.8 Billion in long term debt as well, just showing the strength of it's balance sheet and how the acquisitions it's made are paying off in time.

Finally the last bit of financial digging I did resulted in me coming across something that did cause me to pause and I feel that any decent DD should include some potential negatives to put the positives into a better, more complete light. The elephant in the room in regards to Waste Management is it's unusually high P/B ratio of 7.7ish. While this ratio is generally not as important in the industrial waste management compared to say the financial sector, it is still important to compare it to its peers. The same three competitors mentioned above all have lower P/B ratios than $WM. Ultimately this just means it is slightly overpriced compared to its book value, this can be explained away simply by the fact that in 2019, seeing that it could pay off all it's short term debt, Waste Management added a large amount of debt to its balance sheet so that it could buy new acquisitions, one such acquisition was Advanced Disposal for 4.6 Billion. This higher P/B ratio also explains Morningstars 2 star rating. However my response to this information is just this: If you plan to buy and hold a stock for 20 years, isn’t it better to open your position early, accrue dividends and price appreciation, while buying dips, than to just wait for its P/B ratio to dip down to a level you’re more comfortable with? Especially considering that there is a very good chance that as the debt goes down as the acquisitions begin paying for themselves, so too will the P/B ratio fall.

Moving on from financials and more towards hard assets, Waste Managements true strength starts to take form as it truly lives up to what one imagines from a company with first-mover advantage in its respective sub-sector. The company services over 20 million residential and 2 million commercial customers in 48 US States, Canada, DC, and Puerto Rico. $WM has a total of 293 active landfills with an average remaining lifespan of 22 years per landfill. They also have 346 waste transfer/consolidation stations, 146 recycling centers making it the largest recycling network in the nation , 16 waste to energy facilities that burn up to 23,000 pounds of trash to generate up to 670 MW/hour of electrical/steam energy, enough to power 660,000 homes. Waste Management also boasts 4 new Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) facilities that have already created more than 16 million gallons of RNG since coming online. This is enough RNG to power 1/3 of their 26,000 strong fleet and sell the remaining to local energy companies that then use the RNG to power roughly 460,000 homes. Finally every other landfill that WM owns and operates that isn't a special waste-to-energy or RNG facility also has some more basic ways to capture the methane that comes naturally with decomposing trash and sells that to local gas-to-energy companies that use the supplied methane to help power an additional 180,000 homes per year, bringing the total number of homes powered by trash to a whopping 1.3 million and WM only plans to raise that number to over 2 million in the coming years.

The last aspect of Waste Management that I want to discuss is their future growth prospects and why I am bullish on them as a company overall despite the higher than average P/B ratio the company currently has. Everyone creates waste and we all need that waste taken away somewhere so that we can live the normal lives we have become accustomed to. In addition to being the largest, the first, and objectively the best waste management company, $WM is also investing heavily into renewable energy by harnessing the naturally occurring methane and other RNG’s that are simply by-products of their primary business.  In addition to selling the naturally produced energy that they found themselves having on their hands, $WM has also found a way to make money off of full and capped landfills by taking advantage of existing power lines that run to and from local electrical infrastructure turning them into solar farms and boosting the local power supply. Waste Management is also currently undergoing a change in it's payment model, a shift away from a flat rate bundled model that didn’t take into account the costs of processing and holding the waste $WM picks up, and is changing to a fee-for-service model which will take into account everything from pick-up to transport, to recycling to even the costs it takes to turn that waste into energy. This move will essentially turn every action $WM takes into a way to make money. By providing such an essential service that no-one is exempt from needing, $WM has positioned itself amazingly to continue being the industry leader in waste management for decades to come. And that is no understatement, Waste Management has proven to be a very sticky company with a customer typically being a customer for 10+ years. The final aspect of $WM’s growth potential I want to dig up hits closer to home for me and those in Texas than others, and that is Waste Management basically has a monopoly in Texas. Yes there are competitors here, but between being headquartered in Houston which is the 4th largest city in the nation and rapidly growing, and having cornered the market in the new silicon valley cities of San Antonio and Austin, $WM can rest easily knowing they have future customers for years to come.

Overall I am extremely bullish on Waste Management and see this as an investment to hold for the 25 to 30 years I have left until retirement and honestly, with $WM I might get to retirement early, and while investing in trash might not be a dirty job, as someone who grew up watch Mike Rowe, I think it's only fitting that I make my portfolio get a little dirty to make money."

2021-05-02 10:42:43,stocks,"Peter lynch’s books were great, but I’d warn against chasing good ideas from 30 years ago. What made waste management, funeral homes, and other ‘gross business’ such a prime pick was the fact no one wanted it, p/e of <5, and it couldn’t go away. Everything is “priced in” now, as it’s a heavily watched stock due to its moat. 

The oil market is my current example for beaten down; but it’s not going any where. Everything has either oil or a byproduct of oil in it. Everyone is convenced oil is dying, but it more looks like we hit the consolidation period on scale with the auto-manufactures.

2021-05-02 04:27:45,stocks,"It's funny, I had a similar realization this year when looking to get back into the stock market and thinking of companies that are most likely to keep running long term. I looked out my window, saw my trash cans and ding, lightbulb went off. 

I didn't do a deep dive like you did, mainly because I'm a research novice, but had this uncontrollable urge to buy in. 

I took a look at my investment account I hadn't touched for years and lo' and behold I had just enough cash to buy one share that day, been happy with it since. Now that I am thinking of more long term investments, your write up makes me want to plan for more, though I'll either have to find an ETF with good exposure to $WM or switch to a broker that does fractional shares. Looked into Computershare for their direct purchase plan but those fees are too much for me. 

Keep up the good work!"

2021-05-01 22:52:02,stocks,Agreed. Truly turning trash and waste into solid energy.
2021-05-02 10:55:52,stocks,"I would disagree only because as they implement better natural gas capture tech they will be able to more efficiently capture RNG and methane to sell as energy. This could open them up to becoming a hugely profitable company all over again as currently only like <10% of their current revenue comes from this. They are building more and more RNG capture facilities and have the largest of it kind in the states. Not to mention their repurposing of capped landfills into solar farms. Personally I see them as an industrial play with great exposure to the coming renewable energy boom.

As far as the Peter Lynch book comments, I have no idea who that is and I’m not familiar with his work I’m afraid. I’m 23 and started seriously investing (or more accurately individual stock investing) only this January."

2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Unpopular Opinion: Saying that people don't regularly beat the market based on the fact that massive mutual funds don't is misleading. I see something along the lines of ""well even professionals don't beat the market, which is why you should invest in only index funds"" plastered all over every stock subreddit, discord, and twitter feed. Now I'm not denying the success rates of these funds. I know that over the course of 10 or 20 years only a small percent beat the market. That does not in any way reflect how an individual could perform. Mutual funds with billions under management have so many things going against them that a retail trader doesn't. The first is a management fee. The manager will take somewhere in the ballpark of 1% which starts them off behind. Their career is directly tied to their performance and so there is an incredibly strong incentive to be conservative with any speculation. Due to the size of the funds they can't easily invest in small companies or more obscure opportunities. Also due to the size of the funds they raise the price as they buy and drive it down as they sell getting a worse price on both ends than a retail investor. Between these things I think a reasonable retail investor has a significant advantage over these funds and so I think making silly claims comparing the two's success rate is misleading."
2021-05-02 13:13:41,stocks,"Hedge funds' underperformance is not the only piece of evidence against excessive stock picking for the average retail investors. There are plenty of literature that retail investors over the long run underperform the market as well the more they tried to pick stocks. 

Recall as well that the average retail investor command what? 500k portfolio? If you beat the market by a whopping 2X (30% as opposed to 15% of the index), you gain an extra 75k. Sounds great right? Except you have spent a lot of time and brain power on DD (and looking at price chart is not DD) to get that extra edge. If you're a professional worker like doctor or lawyer, you will easily clear more than that 75k/year. So that extra edge over the market comes at the opportunity cost, obviously unless you want to half-ass your DD and pray that you get lucky. Whereas a 1% market beat by a fund with 50 billion portfolio can afford to have legions of analyst, Phd, mathematician at their service. 

All in all, retail investors do not usually realize how much time and effort it actually take to do proper research on companies. How many people on this sub actually read carefully all the 10Ks of the companies in their portfolios? And that is only the beginning, the bare minimum, of their DD. How many retail investor will then read the 10Ks of the peers and competitors of their favored companies? How many will subscribe to and buy independent DD by professionals who do opposition research on companies? Reading Opposition research is crucial in investing."
2021-05-02 01:35:44,stocks,"While I concede that a retail investor is perhaps less burdened than large financial institutions and has more freedom to use their capital however they please, the average retail investor simply doesn’t employ strategies that are competitive with market returns on a long-term basis. 

Any individual could be the exception, but that’s a minority of people. Especially with all of these stock hype channels on YouTube promoting bad behavior for retail investors. Given all the people who are weighted heavily into speculative securities who don’t even know something as simple as why market cap is more important than share price, telling them their strategy is unlikely to beat the market long-term is good advice that will mostly fall on deaf ears."

I think your assumption that large hedge funds don't have access to more unique investments or have greater limitations is flawed.

Everyone's a genius when chance works for them, but it usually was ""the market"" when it doesn't.

You can try to beat the 50/50 chance by doing due diligence, only investing in high value, low risk stocks etc. pp. but then any black swan you will have missed prior to the fact will kick you in the butt and pull you down - and it might be a small one just pulling down your sector, so the index at large might not get a huge dent, but your sector stock does.

On average the indexes  make 7% a year, going back to 1930, it has been a lot better in the past few years. So a fund with 100mil will get 7 mil a year and not beat the market. 

In reality, they probably do a bit better, so if they make 11%, they get 3 mil to themselves and give the customer 8% the customer is still better off than following an index.

2021-05-02 17:11:16,stocks,My opinions have remained the same for awhile. I'm just tired of seeing this really poor example used. If you have data on individuals performances in the market then go ahead and use that but people so often use an apples to oranges approach.

2021-05-02 10:46:30,stocks,"I mean, I don’t think that’s impossible but you have to recognize it’s REALLY difficult, even if someone knows their stuff.

Predicting stocks is hard and even if you put in the work, you can still be dead wrong. Even then, say someone gets it right and they beat the market. How much are we talking? Studies show it’s usually not by a lot, usually by just a few percentage points.

So why would an average Joe want to put in so much effort for something like this when you can plug most of your assets into a robo advisor or index fund and spend your time more productively, such as advancing your career to earn more wealth?

I plug 5% of my actual investments into individual stocks just to “scratch the itch.” Otherwise it makes no sense to me to spend so much time doing “DD” to fight against a system I have a 5% chance to beat with marginal returns at best.

This is no offense to you, but most people who seem to push back against the notion we can’t beat the market do so to justify bad investment habits they know they have, but just don’t want to admit it yet."

2021-05-02 11:01:10,stocks,"I “beat the market” but by leveraging against it.  Usually 2x or 3x funds.  I typically get 1.8 on a 2x and 2.7x on a 3x do to erosion but i’ve always outpaced in short term.  It hurts if you are in those funds during big drops.  So I attempted to time things.  Pandemic was easy to time i pulled money out (not all of it) in January and just avg down.  Also adding lots of new cash till it bottomed.  Now all new money is staying in cash and i now can sell some of that other money or move it into non-leverage indexes.  

But its all short term higher risk.  More people just fail at this than a plain jane approach. 

You can beat it but if you do remember it’s arguably luck and the statistics are not in your favor."
2021-05-02 16:19:31,stocks,"I'm heavy tech and growth/speculation and I'm only down 3% on the year. I've stayed afloat because roughly 50-55% of my portfolio are index funds with a few blue chip retail stocks like Costco and Walmart. And because I don't use leverage. 

Even if I break even this year, or worse am in the red, my average return over the last few years is higher than the market. It's not to say it'll continue or that I'm going to beat the market long term and I know I can go years with suboptimal performance. It's precisely why I choose a portfolio that I'm not going to abruptly change due to whatever season the markets are in. 

It's my opinion that the only way for retail to beat the market is buying into high conviction, having a balanced portfolio relative to your risk tolerance and not selling. Think long term and sustainable. It says something with dead people have the best returns (Fidelity study)."

2021-05-02 10:27:10,stocks,"The fees are part of investing in funds.

If you were to rebuild a mini ETF in your portfolio, each position will cost you fees. The only thing that's different from ""funds"" vs. individual stock is no management fees.

The moves within the ETF would cost you net more vs. what a huge brokerage pays for re-allocations.

If you want to beat the ""market"" (or your preferred index) you can do so with one stock. But that puts diversification targets at peril - or you live with a huge clump risk, to each their own. A lot of funds will do constant asset reallocations on their best (educated) guesses to try to prevent massive drawdowns and the same to ""beat the market"" ...

What I am saying is a more general ""beat the odds"" might just be down to chance, either way."
2021-05-02 16:08:15,stocks,"Agree with a lot of what you wrote, I however want to point out that there's a lot of assumptions being thrown around from all sides. 

Reality is we don't have the data to know one way or the other, and to what extent of retail investors do beat the market long term. When you factor in fees and the friction that used to exist just a decade ago that alone tilts against stock picking. That said, we're entering a golden age of investing with near zero friction and if you have the right mindset and approach I think a few decades from now we will find more people beating the market than ever before. Again, need that data though."

2021-05-01 22:36:46,stocks,I mean there have literally been studies done by Vanguard on this very topic.  I don’t remember the exact stats but a total market index fund like VTSAX beat 80% of mutual funds over a short time period (5 years) and only 1% of mutual funds beat the total market index fund over a longer term (like 20 years).  So maybe the millionaires aren’t that smart or don’t want to take the time to do the research.  They prob don’t care about 2% fees for a poorer result.  They probably just want someone else to do it for them because they are already rich.
2021-05-01 22:39:54,stocks,"You can absolutely get and be wealthy without knowing how to invest at all. While these funds don't beat spy, due to their conservative nature I don't believe they have as big of drawdowns either."

2021-05-01 22:46:46,stocks,"It doesnt answer my question though. Rationally if people know that the market gets them 15% every year then in order to justify the fees these firms have to beat 15% and more just to survive and exist, much less thrive and make money for themselves and investors. So where is this return coming from if they cant get more than 15% a year?"
2021-05-01 23:07:38,stocks,Its possible that these massive funds do beat the market regularly because they are able to leverage and make huge buys on under the radar and popular stocks because of their insider(both legal and illegal) knowledge and high frequency trading tools. It doesnt make any sense that they can survive at all much less thrive for years and years with the fees they charge if they max out at 15% a year. Literally the math of it does not work out.

2021-05-02 11:05:39,stocks,They didn’t say vanguard.  They said low cost index funds.  Even Warren Buffett has said he wants his wife to invest in a low cost s&p 500 index fund when he dies.  Not to mention he made a million dollar bet with a mutual fund that an s&p 500 Index fund would beat an actively managed account over a 10 year period.  He won.

They make money regardless of the returns.  I had a financial advisor try to brag to me about the returns he got over the last year when I had better results just doing it myself.  A blind monkey could have made 50% plus from March last year to this year if you didn’t panic sell and just kept on investing.

2021-05-01 23:21:34,stocks,"Ok?  But then you have to account for fees.  2% or whatever fees they charge for them to slightly beat the market or a .04% fee to invest in a total market index fund.  That’s 5 years also.  The stat I gave was that over a longer time span (20-30 years), only 1% of hedge funds beat the market.  If you want to have someone actively manage your money for high fees that’s fine, but your return over the long run will more than likely be worse."
2021-05-01 23:27:04,stocks,"Apparently its more like [10%](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/investment-pros-cant-beat-the-stock-market-2020-7#:~:text=According%20to%20a%202020%20report,failed%20to%20beat%20the%20market.)

And i still dont understand how these funds exist, they have to make a profit for themselves on top of the market beating returns they promise investors so where is that money coming from? Again, if they cant beat the market that means they are getting significantly sub 15% returns. I dont understand this obsession with irrational trains of thought here. Why is it so hard to accept the possibility that maybe these massive funds with billions at their disposal and an army of algo bots and insider collusion can do significantly better than the average median salary investor that buys SPY?"

2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Which FAAMG stocks do you think have the most potential 5-10 years? Not asking for recommendations but curious to hear thoughts. FAAMG, as Goldman Sachs defines as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google, (Not to be confused with Jim Cramer's FAANG, which substitutes Netflix for Microsoft) have been among the most dominant players in terms of growth, volume and market cap.

All of them have an arguably strong role to play in our society in the many years to come. 

I am curious to hear if anyone is particularly bullish or bearish on the outlook for any of these mammoth companies? 

Some focus questions: Do you think either of them are particularly positioned to dominate a new sector? Have some grown so large that they will stagnant from here? Do some now face legal risks because of alleged anti-competitiveness?"
2021-05-01 23:05:43,stocks,"Own all of them.

I think GOOGL might have the most immediate upside as part of the reopening trade."
2021-05-02 09:34:24,stocks,"Definitely Google. They're growing at an insane pace, creating new technologies through AI (i.e. folding proteins), YouTube ad revenue is insane and they can generate income in multiple currencies, which is a good hedge against dollar inflation. I don't know how any company can be bigger than Google, and I don't think any company will stay bigger for long"
2021-05-01 22:11:52,stocks,I'm definitely looking to add more Microsoft and Apple.
2021-05-02 00:08:37,stocks,"My money's on Amazon, literally. If Jassy is half as good as Bezos, their ability to succeed in any market will make them incredibly robust -- while avoiding concerns about becoming a monopoly in any one area. eCommerce is still a small fraction of overall commerce, and AWS is a profit machine.

I'm also heavy on Apple and Microsoft, but a bit less. Apple has an incredible hardware side, with innovations like the M1 chip likely to result in massive sales for years to come. But it also recognizes that it needs to transition from hardware (phones specifically) to software in order to maintain their growth rate -- their ability to diversify into a services model will be important for their long-term success. They have no cloud computing, which to me seems odd as it would be a natural extension of iCloud and an easy profit maker. I'm also a bit worried about the $90B share buyback -- while it's good for shareholders like me short-term, it implies that they have no better use for the money, like R&D. It might be evolving into a value company, not a growth company, which in tech is a dangerous thing.

Microsoft is the safest option -- it trades at a low multiple, is well diversified, and has a great CEO. Azure will keep them growing for the next several years, although it does have tough competition. The main reasons it's not my dominant position: they haven't had the same historical growth rate as Amazon or Apple, are pretty weak in the hardware department (particularly when compared to Apple), and don't have a great reputation among consumers for quality (few people really like MS Office or Windows, they just don't have other options in most circumstances).

I don't have Google or Facebook. I like Google, and I plan on adding to it if there's an opportunity. I'm a bit less enthusiastic about it, because it has less of a moat than the others and has had a recent run-up in price, so I don't think it's a bargain right now.

I'm most bearish on Facebook. They almost have an anti-moat; a ton of people younger than 40 really hate the company and its leader. Their main site will diminish in significance as demographics shift, so they need to keep acquiring the next trendy social media site to stay relevant. I view that as a dangerous game -- maybe they can pull it off, but it seems like much more of a gamble than the others. 

Warren Buffet made a good point in his recent shareholder meeting -- none of the top 20 companies by market cap from 30 years ago are still in the top 20. No one could've realistically predicted the current top 20 back then, and several of them didn't even exist then. So there's no reason to expect any of the FAAMG companies to remain dominant long-term; we need to keep watching and seeing how the landscape shifts over time."
2021-05-01 21:46:46,stocks,"My fairly-mature portfolio's weight is 46% AMZN, 26% GOOG, 18% AAPL, 7% FB... and the remainder is non-FAANG/FAAMG.  

That's how much I believe in the FAAMG family.  

And the weighting basically tells you where I believe the most returns are in the next few years.  

Are there legal risks ahead? - Yes.  Do they bother me? - Nope, they're likely just speed bumps in the grand scheme of things.

*Edit - I don't own MSFT simply because I bought & then exited at good prices prior to my current holdings.  But I absolutely expect to include MSFT again soon(ish)."
2021-05-02 14:53:44,stocks,"Going in reverse order:

* GOOG: I'm skeptical on their ability to continue growing so rapidly. They're overly dependent on ads, and they dominate some of their markets (like search) so much that it's nearly impossible for them to grow it anymore without the market itself growing. The only thing Google has that I can see fueling above average growth overtime is Waymo's self driving vehicles, and a lot of evidence seems to show that Google themselves is losing confidence in Waymo (i.e. selling equity in Waymo to third parties despite having tens of billions in cash sitting around, top Waymo people leaving of late).

* FB: Too overly dependent on ads, and I don't see their non-ad revenue segments doing all that well. Like Google they also lack growth potential due to already dominating social media so much, not to mention there's *zero* chance the government is going to let them buy up another social media competitor again given all the anti-trust talk there already is around Facebook.

* AAPL: I think the Apple vs Epic lawsuit is a huge risk that could really hurt them in the next 5 to 10 years. Even if Epic loses in court, there's the legal risk of various governments cracking down on their monopoly like powers in their iOS eco-system. But at the same time I can't deny their ability to constantly defy my expectations and continue to grow. Given the mixed circumstances I put them right in the middle, with the highest probability to over or under perform based on stuff I outlined.

* AMZN: Unlike others on this list, while AMZN is huge, they aren't so big they lack any room to keep growing in their biggest markets. They're involved in a ton of different things. I think they'll continue to do well overtime.

* MSFT: The most well oiled machine of the bunch imo. They're well diversified and Azure is a beast. I think they'll continue to grow nicely overtime and outperform the other FAANGM stocks."
2021-05-02 07:01:07,stocks,I would say Google because of their research on AI.

2021-05-02 11:57:39,stocks,"All the following is just my opinion and I might be completely wrong;

Facebook and Apple are the two that are most susceptible to fad swings in consumers, Facebook moreso. Comes with the territory of having the largest part of your revenue tied to one ecosystem. Apple seems to be able to keep snagging new users into that ecosystem though.

Amazon is a behemoth with so much already locked in but also the most risk from having to battle regulations. I have this small fear that they already ""won"" so there's not that much easy pickings left.

Google is the one with the most potential growth, but they might be spread a bit too thin for their current capabilities to really dig into all those growth avenues without losing focus in others.

Microsoft is the most stable, they have their finger and are succeeding in a lot of shit. Current leadership is also excellent and they seem to be steadily marching forward even if at a slower pace than the others."

Amazon = most undervalued imo, their growth is insane, here in EU there is no alternative. but they should diversify faster into grocery shopping and stuff like that, that's where competition is coming in right now.

Apple = my biggest position, they have all the cash to diversify into new fields and the brand helps to push sales on even very unremarkable products (Airpods Max)

Facebook = can't justify investing in them right now, even though that's probably not very wise

2021-05-02 16:39:34,stocks,"I think out of all the top technology companies, Google is the winner in terms of fundamental research and development. They are at the cutting edge of many emerging industries like quantum computing and AI, and their universities collaboration is excellent. Google attracts the best and brightest out of the top graduate programs around the country - in this respect, they are far ahead of their competitors because the moon shot factories at Google really are moon shot factories. They're not just a ""practical research"" company. They are a top research company.

Whether this translates into profits, though, is a different story as we all know research is high risk, which is why traditionally universities operated at a loss and required either donations, foreign students, or government subsidies to keep them running. To the extent that Google can leverage their powerful research departments into actual profit making products and services, Google is the most promising of the big technology companies. 

But we all know what happened to IBM and Bell Laboratories - former examples of research oriented technology companies that fell on hard times when their core businesses disintegrated. To avoid the same fate, Google must do more than produce advancements. They must focus on the quality of their products & services, which until recently, I felt they were pretty mediocre at. But to Google's credit, they are getting better at it so I am optimistic about the company's near future."

1. On the PC world their competitors are growing faster than them (Windows --> MacApple, ChromeOS. Office --> Google Docs)

3. Hardware would  extremely difficult for them to grow or sustain= Consoles might have reached their peak already with cloud streaming attacking on one side, and smart TVs on the other. Their rest of their hardware business hasn't gained any real momentum for years
4. Cloud is their one redemption point, especially with their revival as an open and dev friendly company (vs the closed nature of the past). However, competition is extremely competent there, so there is no reason to believe they'll gain the no.1 spot. (In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Google overtake them).

While Google has a bit of a track record of failing to land innovations, it’s telling that a company as large / innovative and well-funded as Google wasn’t able to launch a successful competitor to Facebook, with Google+ collapsing. We’re not in the early noughties anymore, with multiple competing social media platforms on the same level. Which new social media platforms have the resources on hand to actually compete with Facebook? Unless they’re backed by serious money, I don’t see it.

While Facebook continues to have enormous amounts of cash on hand and successfully move into different verticals, it’ll stay ahead of any competition. Instagram remains the most popular social media platform, and its monetised very effectively. Can’t really fault Facebook’s acquisition or running of the business. Also means any new social media company is competing against both.

Slight point of pedantry with competitors: Facebook did launch before Twitter, but only just. Twitter has been around since 2006. I wouldn’t say it’s cannibalising Facebook’s market share.

Facebook is moving pretty successfully into VR gaming with the Oculus. They’re also taking a larger piece of the local marketplace pie. While at present this is against companies like Craigslist and Gumtree and therefore not too difficult, it’s establishing itself as a local marketplace. I can see it cannibalising some of eBay’s market share, particularly with partnerships like Shopify being expanded 

The biggest bear case for Facebook is that it could get broken up. As much as the Biden administration hates Facebook and big tech isn’t necessarily popular with the Democrats, it’s weathered everything so far. Even if it does get split, investors would be getting stock in some excellent individual companies."

In order to retire at 50, assuming you had no house payment, car payment, etc, I would guess you would at minimum want $500,000 ($15,000 from dividends assuming you get 3% which is on the higher side, so bare bones living). To get 500,000 you would need to invest $1500 a month for the next 15 years.   


Realistically unless you start living barebones and maybe even getting a second job you will not be able to retire at 50 using historical market rates. At best it would realistically take 20 years of investing $1500 a month before you could comfortably retire and live off of the dividends.   


My advice is to dump all your money into ETF's like VOO, VTI, QQQ and after a year or two of doing that and better learning the market, start trying to play with high risk/high reward stocks (but never make them more than 10% of your portfolio). Your chances of just dumping all your money into a stock and hoping it jumps 20x is extremely small and if you lost you'd guarantee working until you're 70."
2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Self Driving Cars and Tesla's FSD Disclaimer: work in ML and robotics field, done lots of research in RL and control.

&#x200B;

Tesla and its FSD are quite controversial: Fans appraised FSD beta 8.2 as if they are going to fly to the moon soon; Haters think Tesla's bankruptcy is around the corner. My take? There are quite some misunderstandings around self driving technologies, and Tesla use an interesting (and aggressive) approach. Since it is such a complex topic I will just keep it simple and pick a few often discussed points.

&#x200B;

Roughly speaking, a self-driving stack can be functionally divided into **perception-planning-control** blocks. Depending on the approach, each block can be quite complex. This applies to Tesla's FSD. Car control is a relatively mature tech with years of experiences and not a huge problem for self-driving cars at the current stage, as we are not trying to do drifting or anything fancy for now.

&#x200B;

Perception used to be really challenging before the age of NNs (i.e. since 2010s). Now it is much better and probably partially ""solved"" through sensor fusion (camera, LiDAR, etc) + HD maps (as in Waymo and probably Cruise). It is still a problem for Tesla, who take an pretty aggressive, camera only approach.

&#x200B;

Many people fighting over ""camera is the best"" and ""LiDAR is the dead end"", are still mostly talking about the perception part. As I mentioned, perception is ""partially solved"" for Waymo in geo fenced area using sensor fusion. IHMO this is not because they are limited in their tech, but more of a choice for safety purpose. In fact to get the sensor fusion done properly, for each modal you need some NNs to be trained with labelled data (thinking about labelled humans in LiDAR point clouds in addition to camera images). On the other side, Tesla do the ""leap of faith"" with cheap sensors, which is understandable as they need to sell cars and are more sensitive to costs. Which is the ""right"" approach? No one knows and depends on what you define by ""right"". Here let me list a few remarks below and hopefully clarify some common misconceptions:

* More data does not equals to automatically accuracy improvement. Lots of factors like new architecture, hyper parameter tuning and label accuracy play more important role.
* BTW Tesla have being throwing data away for many years.
* The problem with driving is that, rare events follow some long tail distributions and thus there will always be ""out of range"" data which the NNs have to extrapolate.
* What DNNs learnt might not be what you want it learn and they can be fooled through adversarial attacks. Partially the reason we want to have redundancy sensors which may be fooled in different ways.
* Is LiDAR doomed in rainy days? Nope, there are already solutions for that, a few years ago.  There are also progresses of LiDAR in thick snow and fogs, check University Waterloo and MIT media lab's works.
* LiDAR hurts eyes: not much in 1550 nm range unless you peek at it for at zero-point for long time.

&#x200B;

Alright, suppose that Tesla successfully solved this perception problem using their cameras and auto labelling, what is next? We have not talked about motion planning, which is arguably the hardest part. What makes motion planning hard is the ""semantics of driving"", i.e. driving in a safe, socially acceptable way and properly interactions with other moving agents: the joint probabilistic distribution of many moving agents around the car is extremely hard to model and intractable. It is easy to make the robot/car move in a relatively static environment, even if the road can be unpaved and covered with leaves.

&#x200B;

The devil lies in busy urban areas. For example, what if the car turns half way in a intersection and blocked by traffics in front? What if there are no MPH sign in certain roads how fast/slow should the car drive? How do we understand the intention of each pedestrian/cyclist/driver? We do that through eye contact, gestures, etc., but the car cannot do it. This is both a challenge for the perception (to understand the subtle social cues), and the planning part, to make socially acceptable decision that does not scare the other parties who may make wrong decisions that can cause incidents. This has been the main reason behind the ""slow progress"" of Waymo since probably 2015-ish. You can find plenty videos of Waymo car in a busy parking lot without any driver on YT. They can operate in these scenarios, thought not elegantly.  

&#x200B;

On the other hand, Tesla barely touches this today, as you can find in some beta tester's video of FSD in SF.  It is generally doing a much better job than a year ago, yet you can observe the difficulty of this crowd scene driving problem. Both Waymo and Cruise are officially entering SF this year and we will see how they handle such messy scenarios soon. By ""official"" I mean running their driverless cab services for public, but the tech has been tested in many more cities including SF, and they just did not advertise that. 

  
BTW for anyone interested, current Waymo's planning stack is based on a ""MultiPath"" approach. Meanwhile, I feel Tesla is using some sort of heuristics + MPC (model predictive control), as visible from the planned path that is jumping/wiggling all the time.

So, how long can Tesla be ready for robo-taxi? For this part I would say, technically it will be very long: Adding the last ""9"" in 99.9999% reliability required for lv5 may take more effort than getting to 99.99%.  Currently FSD beta 8.2's disengagement data shows 10-20 miles per intervention or complete disengagement (again, from beta testers' own video). This metric for Waymo and Cruise last year is 29000 miles, a few orders of magnitude in difference.

However, Elon is great at telling stories and convincing ordinary folks to test their beta software on car without paying them (well, people have to pay to be a beta tester which is amazing from a sales POV).

TLDR: Robo-taxis is far, self driving is fun :)"

2021-05-01 21:31:48,stocks,"While Tesla FSD is definitely hyped, I do think they have a better chance at attaining FSD with their methods on large scales than other competitors, but in my view that's not the best part about their camera method compared to lidar. Not only are camera's potentially a great idea for self driving, but they also work extremely well as security and for insurance (as well as unseen benefits such as windshield wipers). When an insurance company can see exactly what happened/as well as who is at fault, it saves an enormous amount of time/money. There is a reason many truck drivers and drivers in general are installing dash cams in their vehicles."

I dont believe that self driving will happen without politicians lowering the bar and then protecting the companies from lawsuits. I dont think our approach right now will never reach human level. We need behavioral AI and though I am sure someone is working on it, its a PR nightmare so no one will admit it they are even trying.

The other, safer possibility, is politicians need to create laws and engineers create roads specific and maybe exclusive to self driving. It would basically be like a more flexible, on demand, mass transit system. I would actually be behind this. Business would pay too."

But I think the risk is where people find alot of fun. When investing in individual businesses, make sure your portfolio is diversified, and learn about the RSI and the MACD indicators. Kevin Oleary recommends never letting one position be over 5% of your total holdings, and to never let one sector be more than 20% of your holdings. That's some good advice that I don't follow.  


A good piece of advice I DO follow is to never put more money in your brokerage account than you're prepared to lose. Seriously, as soon as it's in there, come to terms with it being gone. Much of the mistakes in the stock market are made from a lack of patience, whether its not wanting to do due diligence, or just being able to HODL for the tendies.

Real yields are flat to lower recently, supporting Gold’s move off its lows. While Powell says rising inflation is temporary, all evidence is to the contrary. While yields cannot be allowed to get out of hand and risk the collapse of everything, inflation will continue to rise as the printing presses remain plugged in and supply chains break down. This is the foundation for the coming surge in precious metals. I don’t see the 30-Year T-Bond going beyond the 2.75-3.00% resistance zone.

2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"About 87% of Companies in the S&P have beaten analyst estimates, set to be the higgest beat rate on record since 1994 https://www.reuters.com/business/wall-st-week-ahead-blow-out-us-earnings-suggest-market-has-room-run-2021-04-30/

Article for those who want to scroll through quickly:

U.S. companies are leaping above expectations on first-quarter earnings, giving investors stronger confirmation that profit growth will be able to support the market this year.

A big piece of that growth is coming once again from technology and growth companies, which suggests greater durability in companies that underperformed more economically focused value names for months.

Earnings are rebounding from last year's pandemic-fueled lows. With results in from more than half of the S&P 500 companies, earnings are now expected to have risen 46% in the first quarter from the previous year, compared with forecasts of 24% growth at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

About 87% of reports have come in ahead of analysts' estimates for earnings per share, putting the quarter on track to have the highest beat rate on record going back to 1994, when Refinitiv began tracking the data.

Some strategists say the stronger-than-expected earnings could drive a richly valued market higher still. The benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) is trading at about 23 times forward earnings, above the long-average of about 15, based on Refinitiv's data.

""The earnings results are really not being fully priced in yet, and that's because you're seeing estimates for the back half of the year start to pick up now in response to this better-than expected environment. That says to us there's still more room,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

The high percentage of beats also follows many quarters where companies were holding off on giving guidance on the future, making it harder for analysts to estimate results for this year.

Citing stronger earnings, Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist and head of quantitative research at Credit Suisse Securities, on Friday raised his 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4,600 from 4,300. The S&P 500 index (.SPX) was last at about 4,180.

Stocks have had little reaction to results overall so far. The S&P 500 is up more than 11% since Dec. 31. The index is up less than 2% since mid-April when the earnings period kicked in to high gear, but remains near record highs.

Earnings also are raising some fresh questions in the debate over growth versus value. After a decade of steadily under-performing the overall market, value has been a favorite among some investors as a bet on the reopening of the economy.

However, ""tech is showing an ability ... to still create as good, if not superior, sales growth to cyclicals. That's what I find amazing,"" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS.

""Tech is as much as of a reopening play as everybody else,"" he said.

Investors will be watching reports in the weeks ahead to see if the trend continues. Results are expected next week from a wide range of companies including Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), Cummins Inc (CMI.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N).

The first-quarter results come after a months-long rally in value stocks as investors bet on the reopening of businesses as COVID-19 vaccines became more available.

Value has outperformed growth names that include heavily weighted technology stocks, and for the year so far, the Russell 1000 value index (.RLV) remains up about 15%, while the Russell 1000 growth index (.RLG) is up about 8% in that time.

Technology-related companies as well as banks - value trade favorites - have had the largest percentage point contribution to estimated first-quarter S&P 500 earnings, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) at the top of the list, based on Refinitiv's data.

Tech (.SPLRCT) is also among the strongest sectors for year-over-year sales growth for the quarter, Bianco noted.

While the risks of higher inflation and possibly higher taxes have given some investors reason to become more cautious on growth shares, earnings may make them think twice about avoiding the group.

""It pays for a lot of investors to be balanced between value and growth,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.

""We're actually carving out a third group ... defensives,"" he said, adding that those are the areas for investors to avoid for now. 

Its hard to find a bearish view on the current market situation when so many companies are beating earnings. Maybe in the short term we'll see some volatility as we finish getting through earnings season, but I don't think we'll see much more falling, if any."
2021-05-01 21:03:09,stocks,Somehow i picked the 13% still.
2021-05-02 00:33:21,stocks,What is the point of Analyst estimates if 87% of companies are beating them?   The analyst estimates are to be taken with a grain of sand.  And the stock movements after the results beating the estimates are laughable.   Most companies that beat the estimates are trending down due to the stock run-ups before the results.
2021-05-01 20:13:10,stocks,"so red day tomorrow?  got it.

2021-05-01 23:55:52,stocks,"All estimates from analyst have been super conservative after covid so that’s why this is happening, not because of some super beat rate. This is more on the analysts and not on overachieving stocks. Everyone overachieves when the bar is set low."

2021-05-02 07:48:31,stocks,"Pretty sure most estimates are based off of guidance... maybe companies are guiding lower than they could but it's not the analysts trying to pump prices with low expectations.

And guidance is used to determine stock value so if a company purposely lowers guidance to beat, their price will drop when they announce that guidance anyway."
2021-05-02 00:10:33,stocks,"Ehh, this hasn't been true of late based off what I've been hearing. I couldn't find you a concrete number but I've heard that the analysts have been raising their EPS forecasts and that there was super high expectations for this earnings season (which from the way it sounds, the expectations have mostly been met).

And honestly, when I initially saw one forward P/E estimate, I was quite surprised. If things pan out as suspected, the market is overvalued but it's not as bad as the doomers want to make it out to be."
2021-05-01 21:12:50,stocks,"Warrenn Buffett is no different to any other ordinary man. He can't predict the wider market movement, and he doesn't really have a case for it. All he can do is try to drive prices down, and judging from the meeting today, I think he's trying to force a market pullback so that he can buy in at a cheaper pricepoint. I certainly wouldn't put it past him either"

2021-05-02 09:45:56,stocks,"Internet logic:

While many have done fine, myself included, this market HAS been a nightmare for those that are in the ""fun"" stocks. NDX and .IXIC both now have new intraday records, had their best month since December, are not ""too"" far off of their record highs, and yet things that are viewed as more speculative can't consistently get going again."

That's your main explanation for yesterday in tech but there likely has to be some concern now that the semis breakout earlier in April was a failed breakout, and that's not a good lead for the Nasdaq-100, which failed seemingly a million times at 13.9-14k (even though it had a great month)."

Otherwise i wouldn't call it nightmare when all my stagnant stocks are stagnant. Describing it as nightmare just doesn't fit there, nothing is happening with them."

2021-05-02 07:55:20,stocks,"I don't think analysts are dumb, it's their job, and I imagine they get payed quite a bit for it. It also comes down to a concensus, so the extremely high, and extremely low estimates are weeded out. I think what happened was that with the easing of covid regulations, they thought less money would be flowing into companies, because now people are back to paying have less money on hand for non-essentials. I'd say the semiconductor shortage was also probably baked into the estimates. There are so many factors that may have been used in calulation, and I really think these results were completely unexpected."
2021-05-02 08:04:09,stocks,"What's dumb about it? Do you think Warren Buffett can foresee the future? Nobody could've predicted Apple would fall after showing such a strong earnings report. Look at Caterpillar as another example. 47% surprise, and they beat their previous quarter by 0.7 EPS (2.1->2.8) and yet closed the day down 3%.We're seeing companies with poor results rise (NIO), while simultaneously watching companies with insane results fall. If you can rationally explain why that might be, I'd love to hear it."
2021-05-01 21:39:31,stocks,"still a guess- even if there is a basis for it. an incredibly vague guess at that.

2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"My take on the SPX This is all Elliot Wave analysis, the only wave analysis I've been using for years.

Last year about a month after the March drop, the S&amp;P500 was at around 2807 points. At this time I used Fibonacci extension which told me that the SPX was heading for around 3542 before heading for a nasty correction.

When I started commenting in the daily chat and posting my analysis, saying that the SPX was heading for 3542 when it was at 2807, everybody called me a dumbass. And I mean everybody.

All the gay bears were out, guys were losing their life savings bleeding and bleeding averaging down more and more. 3542 seemed like such a fucking long shot. Unemployment, vaccine timeline worries, all that propaganda was RAMPANT. We saw all the bears get decimated and the bulls making the easiest money of their lives.

[Here](https://imgur.com/I0NEx0X) is a pic of the Fibonacci extension and what I was calling for at the time.

Well as we know, the S&amp;P500 got to 3588 before correcting for about 2 months, or 58 days. [Here](https://imgur.com/mtpCyod) is the length of the correction.

Well, what does that matter? Why should you give a fuck?

Well, I've used the exact same method to calculate the end of this wave we are currently on.

[As you can see in this zoomed out version](https://imgur.com/uVhPldA) after using Fibonacci extension the end of this wave will be around 4635. I don't know the timeframe, but after that point we are in for a SERIOUS correction. This will fully complete the wave, so expect worse than what we've seen already.

There are five waves which complete before the ABC correction. Right now we are in the third wave. This is usually the longest, most aggressive wave up. We will go into the fourth correction wave at some point, before getting back into the fifth wave and finalizing around 4635. Use this information however you like, I don't really give a fuck if you believe me or not. But since I only commented and didn't create a post last time, I wanted to have some documentation about what's going to happen.

HOW TO PLAY THIS:

1) Low maintenance method : Buy some UPRO and dont even look at it until the SPX is sitting around 4620 and up. The final fifth wave could be extended, meaning it could go a lot higher. But I will probably close positions around this point and watch, maybe ladder some volatility.

2) Options way : Well we know we are going to get to around 4635, with a correction in between. This can be played a few different ways, probably a good method would be calls 3-5 months out. Do the same with long volatility. The only time I would buy shorts is if we get close to 4600 without a big correction. Then I would short, if it falls hard close, then ladder calls as it will correct before hitting the 4635 mark and above.

Anyways, if this doesn't pan out I won't be deleting this post. But I stand by this analysis. When I first looked to see the 3542 I thought something was wrong because of all the bad news and with everything going on. I doubted the analysis. Now I don't. This is a bullish as fuck market. Until it isnt. Then we play the down trend. 


But any gay bears who come out talking about inflation, Biden taxes, any of that, dont listen to them. Just remember

**4635**"
2021-05-01 20:33:04,stocks,"I'm not a bear but you can get all kinds of different Elliot Wave interpretations. Like although I haven't talked to him, I know there's one guy on twitter that has said that we're in an extended wave 5 that will end late this summer. 

I don't do Elliot Wave fwiw, but I have picked up on the general tendencies of 2021 (the market stays afloat by rotating and the S&P mostly stays above the 20 day). The time those tendencies stop is probably going to be the next time you get a deeper dip than the shallow ones in the S&P, and who knows when that's going to happen."
2021-05-01 22:05:02,stocks,Wave 3 can't be the shortest yet in your labelling it is ;) i do agree though the big correction is coming making money will be easy again after that one :)

2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"How does wash-sale applies to me? First of all I didn't knew wash sale applies for multiple accounts. That is completely my silliness. I had 100 stock of x $10 each in account1 bought on January 1. I sold 30 of them in loss at $5 in  February 15.

Then I bought 5 stock of x in $4 on February 20 in account2. Then I sold remaining 70 of account 1 in $3 in February 28. And I am still holding position in account2.

Does this trigger wash sale? How much and in how many stocks/amount? Can I avoid it by end of 2021 as I can wait for position of account2 to be closed for several months.

Please forgive me if this question is not applicable in this subreddit."

2021-05-02 01:33:32,stocks,"On the tax side (not sure of any broker or legal implications), the main thing is that you cannot claim capital loss on the sale of the stock in account 1, because you purchased a materially identical stock within 30 days (in this case not just materially identical but literally identical it sounds like).

Are these two accounts under the same broker or at least clearing firm? If so, the 1099 will likely automatically do the math right. If not, you may want to consider using an online software or consulting a cpa rather than filing taxes by hand."

2021-05-02 11:36:48,stocks,"Sorry 25, you have a loss of 5 shares for $5. That gets rolled back into the cost basis when you did the wash sale.

So what occurs is that your cost basis is now $4 per share for buying and the $5 loss, so your cost basis is now $9.

If you sell at $5 again, you would have a $9 minus $5 per share loss, or $20 loss.

If you hadn't rebought, it'd be a loss of $25.

So before you make a financial decision like selling because you want to avoid wash sale calcs, just no it doesn't matter, you pay taxes on your net gain or loss at the end of the year"
2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Where can I find see per-share balance sheet and income statement items? Hi, I wanted to look into various per-share items for many different stocks. I mainly wanted to see items on the balance sheet, things like cash-per share, current assets per share, long term assets per share, BVPS, NCAVPS etc. 

Are there any platforms online which provide per-share balance sheets and income statements? It’s very tedious to have to divide the numbers by the total outstanding shares for each metric and then every single stock I need to look at.

If anyone knows anywhere I can get this data easier it would be really helpful. Currently I know QuickFs lets you see this for a few metrics, but not all the ones I’m looking for.

Any help would be appreciated!"
2021-05-01 20:26:08,stocks,"I’ve never really heard of/ seen current assets per share as a metric (or any balance sheet item per share) before. Perhaps this is in an industry I’ve never look at before, but you can find the company’s financial statements on their websites generally under their “investor relations” section. You can look at their quarterly and annual reports along with MD&A. 

Alternatively you can look under the SEC website and search the company’s for their 10K’s and 10Q’s. You can also find companies using SEDAR’s website (Canadian equivalent - assuming you’re Canadian from your username). 

You can typically find their share outstanding via their MD&A and some companies report their outstanding shares along with an earnings/share number at the bottom of the income statement. Using their shares outstanding you can calculate whatever you need “per share”."

Edit-I’m not talking about a broker. I’m talking about the actual exchanges or the commission. 
And I’m looking for a link to official documents if possible. I would like to find some reading and I didn’t see any so far."
2021-05-02 11:45:39,stocks, sec website would be your best place to dig up
2021-05-01 20:07:07,stocks,"Short squeezes are nothing new and they certainly did not start with GME. GME ended the same way that other short squeezes have in the past. Started with a very strong, quick move to the upside. Eventually things settle and the stock collapses just as fast as it went up. If you sold on the way up, good for you. If you bought at the top, you're holding the bag.

Unfortunately many Redditors, especially those that started putting money into the market recently, caught FOMO and were left holding the bag. Now they are just angry and bitter and coming up with conspiracy theories to somehold make sense of their misfortune. It is very simple; people made a risky bet and they ended up on the losing side. Period. GME is simply trying to find an equilibrium now on its way down.

The real damage of the GME saga is not that people lost money that they could not afford to lose; it's that a bad decision taken at the beginning of someone's investing career often leads to additional bad decisions. Studies have shown that decisions and outcomes taken at the beginning of your investing career, create a bias that lasts throughout the remaining of your life. The people with a bad taste in their mouth from GME would live their lives thinking that ""the market is rigged"" or ""the hedgies are bad"" and will invest less throughout their lifetime.

It's like I told a coworker (we're both Tax CPAs with years of accounting experience). Buy a few shares for the fun of it, but don't expect much. He ended up buying $100 in AMC for $16 a share. We still get a kick out of it everyday but he still maxes the company 401k and IRA."
2021-05-01 20:33:25,stocks,"I understand what you’re saying about the history of short squeezes. But, have any happened in the past with a broker halting due to liquidity issues. From what I understand that was a first. Also, with online trading evolving to what it is now, which is why I said that this is a new world that the historical data can’t really be relied on for (just me thinking, I should’t be stating as fact), can it even be predicted for the another one, for any stock. 
Like you said. Early trading behaviours will shape future trades for individuals. 
So if a stock gets suspended, it’ll likely stop a short squeeze. ie apple, Amazon, or Berkshire. Lol. Just a stupid joke at the end."
2021-05-01 20:45:13,stocks,"Yes, brokers halt trading on their end pretty frequently. I am not sure if they have been exposed as much as Robinhood was to GME though. For them to withdraw $1B from their LOC and seek additional funding sources, things must have been pretty bad.

A trading halt or suspension should not have any impact on the momentum of a short squeeze. The Limit Up/Limit Down (LULD) rule that I posted above is designed to clear all bids within a period of 15 seconds. If it doesn't do that, trading is halted by 5 minutes and resumes back. Again, these rules are made so that all transactions within a reasonable band clear the exchange but it doesn't have any impact in the movement, either up or down. A stock that is crashing because of catastrophic news or is increasing due to superb news will continue its path; regardless of how many trading halts occur."

2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,Long term capital gains tax question I just wanna be clear on one thing...so if your total income is 52k or less then you pay 0 in taxes for long term investments if you're single. So if you make 30k a year at work and made 50k in gains from stocks...so you would only pay capital gains taxes on 28k? Basically everything above the 52k is the only thing that gets taxed and the 30k you made from work would get taxed as normal income?

2021-05-01 23:29:56,stocks,"Haha, I remember downloading the Robinhood app like  more than a year ago and thinking about how easy it was to just buy shares of stocks. It was just too easy that I just didn’t trust it. Opened a fidelity account instead. Glad I did especially after that GME fiasco."
2021-05-01 23:34:38,stocks,"Their only punishment came from millions of members leaving Robinhood to go to other brokers. 
The government works for these people not for the little guys."
2021-05-01 23:35:55,stocks,Cause all those were margin accounts and it's legal. ???
2021-05-01 23:42:41,stocks,"Or the fact that when you buy stuff you dint actually own it or impact the price
Really should stop using it alltogether"

2021-05-01 23:52:35,stocks,"They are balls deep in with citadel(they move 40% of stocks daily based on volume).

The SEC doesnt even want to touch the issue but when the MOASS sucks up all the liquidity and the market crashes they are going to look dumb as fuck and 2008 will look like a joke.

It's coming fam, get ready!"
2021-05-01 23:53:22,stocks,The ruling class doesn't give a fuck that they fucked over us peasants. Nothing will ever happen

2021-05-02 00:07:12,stocks,Go with a good firm. RH is shit.
2021-05-02 00:14:00,stocks,"Because what they did wasn't a crime.  They are being sued, but that takes time."
2021-05-02 00:14:54,stocks,Because laws dont apply to big money
2021-05-02 00:22:04,stocks,I guarantee you that it was all in the fine print of their user agreement. As scummy as it sounds
2021-05-02 00:25:03,stocks,"Just stop using them, that will be punishment enough. I’m pretty sure they’re losing already considering the “incentives” they’re offering now."
2021-05-02 00:35:53,stocks,They had to do it since the hedges had borrowed a ton from Robinhood to short. If they were not able to pay then Robinhood would lose a ton so they did what they had to do
2021-05-02 00:40:24,stocks,Because people are dumb to think they have rights with a private brokerage.
2021-05-02 00:44:54,stocks,What rule did they break?
2021-05-02 00:45:32,stocks,Bc this system isn't meant to benefit you and me.
2021-05-02 00:52:48,stocks,When they've got billionaires on there side they can get away with anything
2021-05-02 00:53:34,stocks,Didn’t the 2008 financial crisis teach us they “protect their own”?
2021-05-02 01:04:00,stocks,I lost 20K on my BB stock because of that and I don’t even use Robin Hood.
2021-05-02 01:06:04,stocks,"I thought this whole restriction thing was suspicious too but after hearing from some people in personal conversations who work in clearance houses, the fact of the matter was that they couldn’t process the amount of transactions happening. After the first wave of GME, they said they set up servers (I think that’s the word) specifically for GME. Not to mention, Robinhood literally didn’t have the capital to process the buy orders. They had to raise like a couple billion over night because they literally couldn’t process what was going on. The market just wasn’t ready for the influx of retail investors at the time. If it was, I think the stock could have gone up to much higher amounts."
2021-05-02 01:09:37,stocks,"Because a broker does not have to meet your expectations of liquidity is the short answer. What does this mean? This means that if their is ever a extremely volatile trading period again, the broker is required to front certain amount of CASH (liquidity) when the clearing house demands the cushion for the large amounts of margin trades the brokerage is offering for the volatile stock in case they need to cover for their clients essentially those trades... this is to prevent a major margin disaster on the brokers side.... if they do not have enough liquidity to meet such demands by the clearing firm they are forced to halt incoming buys from that point on hence why Robinhood stopped buying only at a certain point, but allowed people to close out existing trades whenever fit. They did not violate any rules, they COMPLIED? Understand? This is why as a trader it is up to YOU to find a brokerage that has good service.... not every broker is created equally.. some do have more liquidity than other to cover their trades than others."
2021-05-02 01:12:07,stocks,"It's Shabbos, get off Reddit :p"
2021-05-02 01:17:28,stocks,Because nothing they did was illegal and was in their terms of service. They did not have the capital requirements to clear these trades. Anybody selling you the narrative that there’s some grand conspiracy to fuck over the little guy has no idea what they are talking about.

2021-05-02 01:27:56,stocks,"Have you read the user agreement? Well obviously not because it clearly states it is allowed to limit the buying and selling of stocks as it seems fit. Many other stock trading apps have similar statutes that they haven't ever used. I don't know why people are so confused about it when you literally click an, I read and understand the user agreement, maybe you should've actually read it. I used RH for a bit but switched to a private financial advisor recently. I also am majoring in law in college right now which may explain why I actually read the user agreement...."
2021-05-02 01:38:23,stocks,They’re punished alright. But not by the hand that is fed by it.

Which not enough people read."
2021-05-02 02:06:05,stocks,I dont recommend robinhood as financial advice.
2021-05-02 02:14:44,stocks,"if you are still using Robinhood, you need to know at a minimum, that they sell your trade order info to HFT's.  With the order restrictions that they perpetrate, what else are they doing?

Eff Robinhood.  Move everything you have out of this scumbag shit hole theft circle jerk ring asap"
2021-05-02 03:22:08,stocks,Apparently Japan has one of the most corrupt governments in the world.
2021-05-02 03:34:33,stocks,"I'm no economists, or its not even my area. But we did have Economics is collage. 

My professor explained the common demand supply curve and how price is varied. I'm paraphrasing here, A ""Free Market"" is the one where you can freely buy and sell things, so price is fluctuated based on how much demand is there and how much supply. 

So explain me as if I'm a five year old, how is a free market when you block buying, that's gonna increase supply. Thus driving the price down, how is it a free market? 

If you want to stop trading then both buying and selling should be stopped. That to IF you have a valid reason. 

I genuinely wanna know, how can you block just buying. That to how can a broker take that decision. Shouldn't SEC (We have SEBI in India, I'm not sure if SEC is the right organization) take that decision?"
2021-05-02 03:34:48,stocks,well they've lost at least 10 million customers to fidelity alone because of this especially more because of the recent restriction on DOGE coin.
2021-05-02 03:36:47,stocks,"There’s a billion comments here so sorry if this was answered a billion times already. 
Instead of using Robinhood is there a better app, but a app that isn’t JUST crypto either? 
And is there a way to transfer my crypto out of Robinhood into another app? These can be separate questions if the later is just a no."

2021-05-02 04:14:34,stocks,"Robinhood is a multibillion corporation, with hundreds of lawyers, not to mention billionaire venture capitalists.

Who do you think the justice system will favor?

Robinhood’s IPO is going to make a lot of people very rich. Let’s focus on what’s important. Convincing pension funds and endowment funds to buy Robinhood shares during the IPO.

Anyway, Robinhood’s customers are either too dumb or too lazy to delete the app and leave Robinhood. Look at how many people use Robinhood, the same way people love using Amazon and Facebook. Customers love them."

2021-05-02 05:11:00,stocks,Did etoro do anything like this?
2021-05-02 05:46:27,stocks,Because the terms and conditions that you signed up to explicitly state they’re allowed to restrict trading on any different stock options at anytime.
2021-05-02 05:54:36,stocks,WHY ARE YOU USING ROBINHOOD?? GET OUT!
2021-05-02 06:07:23,stocks,Ohh my sweet sweet summer child

2021-05-02 06:45:58,stocks,Period.  Sadly there’s different rules for different people.  Learned that in elementary school when Timmy took an extra cookie.  The teacher clearly said only 1.
2021-05-02 07:06:40,stocks,Because the owners work for elitists and have way more money and power than us normal apes. It's the law of averages in the stock world.
2021-05-02 07:08:59,stocks,Why. Is. Anyone. Still. On. Fucking. Robinhood!
2021-05-02 07:22:10,stocks,"Because the punishers. 

Are paid by the criminals. 

Citadel paid Janet yellen 850,000 for speaking in 2018 or some shit. 

It’s a fucking scam"
2021-05-02 07:23:42,stocks,I’m more surprised that people are still using Robinhood.
2021-05-02 07:41:23,stocks,Because bureaucrats are there to protect large companies from the little guy - not the other way around.

2021-05-02 15:39:33,stocks,People need to vote with their feet.  I have no sympathy for people still using it and complaining about it.  You have plenty of better options.

To be clear: You own the shares you buy through Robinhood as soon as your order is executed. Period.

To Be Clear!! Robinhood started as a Stock Exchange not a Crypto Exchange, Stop Bitchin about Wallets when they are Working on them as we speak!!!

Robinhood has been helping Amateur Investors for Years!! The Simplicity of it!!

The Instant Deposits, the Quick Transactions,Free Trades ETC

Like what more do you all want!! A Company or I Should say Exchange should have the Ability to Prevent being Destroyed because some Reddit fucks wanna Pump & Dump Assets to Points of No Return!!! Sorry but they have that Right, It was Abused, Sorry everyone fails to see that!

But wake up and stop FUDing on Robinhood

READ THE TERMS AND SERVICES!!"

2021-05-01 20:42:09,stocks,"Robbin hood has the capability of liquidating your stocks if they see fit in times of need,

In simple terms if robbin hood goes belly up they will sell your stocks to get money for themselves."
2021-05-01 21:11:00,stocks,FACTS 💯
2021-05-01 21:29:26,stocks,You’re playing a game that’s rigged against you.  Of course they’re going to cheat when the people start getting the upper hand
2021-05-01 22:47:37,stocks,So what are the possibilities this leads to a short squeeze with DOGE? Are there too many sell orders at $1 or could it realistically go much higher if selling is halted on RH again?
2021-05-02 00:35:21,stocks,"Because nothing they did was illegal. Or even improper when you consider the alternative was insolvency and fucking over of the manority of their clients who weren’t trying to baghold shit. 

None of it is conspiratorial. Their customers are just morons. And RH was improperly capitalized for such a large number of morons to all be morons at the same time with the same shit. Simple as that. They got margin called, basically. 

Switch to a real broker and stop YOLOing bad casino plays and you’re good."
2021-05-02 00:55:01,stocks,Get over it. It’s already done and no one cares.
2021-05-02 02:21:01,stocks,Because it wasn't against the rules. They were actually following the rules the exchanges set for them.
2021-05-02 02:26:28,stocks,Because it wasn’t Robinhood’s decision. Why are people still naive to this
2021-05-02 06:42:03,stocks,"That restricted list was related to shorting.  It stopped shorting.  What they did with gme and amc is unprecedented from what I know.  For example, They never restricted buying  amd.  You could always buy as much amd as you wanted. They restricted shorting amd."
2021-05-02 08:00:26,stocks,"T settlements and liquidity because they r so small compared to fidelity etc. If the moass happens, expect liquidity issues and staggered resttictions across all brokers"
2021-05-01 20:53:10,stocks,"I still use robinhood because they allow me to trade options....

I have an IRA roth 401k and individual account at fidelity, but they have denied me for options trading. So I use fidelity for long term stock plays and robinhood for options...."
2021-05-01 21:23:55,stocks,I just use webull and it's honestly the same as Robinhood without all the bullshit.
2021-05-01 22:35:47,stocks,After the GME fiasco I ditched RH. Fuck them. They’ll never get my money again and in the future I will persuade new investors to stay the fuck away.
2021-05-01 21:42:54,stocks,How exactly do you go about that on mobile?
2021-05-01 21:44:53,stocks,"Called vanguard yesterday. Was on hold over an hour before taking to someone. This is normal for them. 

Vanguard is great for mutuals and etf's, but notoriously bad for hold times, so I don't suggest using them to actively trade.

TD and fidelity both have good response times, from my experience."
2021-05-01 21:47:15,stocks,As far as I know you can’t transfer crypto like you can stock positions from Robinhood. I transferred all of my stock positions to Schwab but still have Doge that I bought at $0.04. Way too risky to sell and try to buy somewhere else.
2021-05-01 21:53:30,stocks,How can you transfer so easily into fidelity? Looking to get everything out of robinhood.
2021-05-01 22:09:05,stocks,whats the advantage of Fidelity Vs Vanguard?
2021-05-01 22:44:58,stocks,"FYI, if you transfer stocks out of Robinhood, Robinhood will charge you 75$ per account. Some brokerages will eat that charge and give you the money back if you email them. I know TD Ameritrade will if you send them a copy of the Robinhood statement that shows their transfer charge as an attachment to an email asking them to return the fee. I don’t know about the other brokerages.

Hope this helps someone save some money!!"
2021-05-01 22:46:06,stocks,Can you transfer options as well?
2021-05-01 23:02:03,stocks,4 Fs sake dump Robinhood!
2021-05-02 00:34:47,stocks,It takes 20 minutes to start the transfer to Fidelity. It takes many more days after that to complete the transfer and trade again. Worth it though. I want actual control over my stocks
2021-05-02 01:30:46,stocks,"Idea. Don't buy doge coin cause it's a fucking joke. Also don't buy CC.... What? Stocks, mutual funds, and optionals too difficult?"
2021-05-02 02:28:15,stocks,"Pfft 20? I build my new account in 5 minutes!

Then it took a week for Robin hood to send it over..."
2021-05-02 03:40:50,stocks,"So stupid question. I see a lot of people below talking about transfer fees. And so e saying how easy tye transfer was. 

Okay, so I have ~13k in Robinhood stocks. Why bother transferring, can't I just sell, withdraw cash, and deposit in new company?"
2021-05-02 04:34:29,stocks,Capital gains take a year unfortunately. I’ll be on it for a while.
2021-05-02 05:19:24,stocks,"At this point Robinhood users are like that one person who keeps getting back into the same abusive relationship expecting things to be different.

Guys just switch brokers, you have options. The biggest punishment RH can face is loosing customers due to screwing customers. If you stay with RH, you are giving them the greenlight to keep getting away with that. Stop supporting bad brokers, just get the ACATS transfer done.

Edit: You guys should never have bought crypto on RH on the first place, use an exchange that gives you access to your wallet keys like Coinbase, Binance, BlockFi, Kraken, etc."
2021-05-02 08:42:04,stocks,Exactly. I switched my money out of Robinhood a few months ago. Couldn't be happier.
2021-05-01 21:49:15,stocks,I submitted a request to transfery rh account to fidelity on February 19th. I just looked today and it turned out to be canceled. I never canceled it. Why was it canceled.
2021-05-02 05:36:58,stocks,"You can't buy doge on vanguard, that's why."
2021-05-02 10:35:25,stocks,You can’t buy doge on fidelity
2021-05-01 21:26:37,stocks,I do not respect the SEC.
2021-05-01 21:41:36,stocks,Run by the same people that own Robinhood. It's just corruption
2021-05-01 21:51:39,stocks,It’s infinitely more likely that the SEC is complicit/turning an eye as a favor.
2021-05-01 22:56:46,stocks,"Can confirm, use to do ARs and 10Ks for 99% of the F100."
2021-05-01 23:55:28,stocks,They are too busy trying to fuck over Ripple
2021-05-02 06:55:49,stocks,I'd say they also have no teeth.
2021-05-02 07:16:55,stocks,I think the only Crypto that got through SEC case and survived is Kin. I'm surprised RH can sell what's not approved/checked by SEC.
2021-05-02 08:11:00,stocks,"They were following regulations. They got in over there head and didn't have enough money to clear the transaction.

I am not defending robinhood, they are a shit brokerage however what people think the reason they stopped trading (some conspiracy with hedge funds) isn't the reason.

They didn't have enough money to settle the stocks."
2021-05-02 13:19:25,stocks,...by design
2021-05-01 20:48:54,stocks,Hello SEC? Yes Reddit cracked another criminal conspiracy case like they did the Boston marathon bomber. So yes they're waiting for their award
2021-05-01 22:02:00,stocks,What law did they break?
2021-05-02 00:25:44,stocks,They don't have any teeth either.
2021-05-01 20:00:30,stocks,"RH was the first to do it, iirc, and they did it with more stocks and more frequently."
2021-05-02 00:55:04,stocks,Ok but who were the others?
2021-05-02 03:05:00,stocks,It's easy to target the startup.
2021-05-02 03:05:27,stocks,"Because they outright lied to their customers as to why they had to restrict trading. They were not liquid enough and didn't have enough margin to facilitate trades according to the new rules imposed by the DTCC but Vlad  lied about it and said some bullshit about protecting customers, while brokers like Webull were upfront about the reasons for the halt.
Once you lose the trust of your customer it's impossible to get it back."
2021-05-02 03:53:20,stocks,Because they were lying and not hiding it.
2021-05-02 04:42:15,stocks,Because they were over 50% of all gme transactions and I'm pretty sure a majority of RETAIL gme transactions. They stopped that stock from going literally to the moon. It was around 300 and when they shut off buying it was down hill until a month ago
2021-05-02 00:01:18,stocks,"I’ve worked in the industry for 20 years. This is correct. The fucking idiots who discovered trading 6 months ago think it’s some grand conspiracy. They’re like qanon supporters, you won’t get though to them."
2021-05-02 05:47:47,stocks,"I like to use the""toilet paper situation in early corona"" as an analogy. Retailers didn't have the foresight to stock up on the TP uptick. 

Doesn't mean there was malicious intent."
2021-05-01 20:47:26,stocks,"Supposedly they restricted the purchase *and* sale of some crypto assets more recently. This presumably would violate some regulation somewhere, no?"
2021-05-02 04:39:18,stocks,"It didn’t merely choose not to offer a security. It held itself out as a broker that allowed for trading of GameStop, then chose to limit only the ability to specifically buy, but not sell, and did so to the financial benefit of people who own the company at the expense of their customers.

Google promissory estoppel. Not saying it applies here but the principle certainly applies and intuitively it seems like what they did would violate the law in general."
2021-05-01 23:02:29,stocks,"In fact, regulations prevent you from trading.  There go to excuse was that they didn't have the fiduciary requirements to handle the massive volumes of trade that surged through their service.

It's a lot easier to prove someone is acting right than acting wrong.  The last investigation into RobinHood took one year to resolve."
2021-05-01 22:23:07,stocks,The fact that you weren’t destroyed by downvotes tells me the hive mind era of WSB may finally be coming to a close. Can we go back to making fun of retail investors who think they’ve figured out the market?
2021-05-01 20:14:57,stocks,"User agreement is the worst argument though. It doesn't bypass any laws or regulations, you could agree to get raped daily yet its just not going to happen legally."
2021-05-02 07:20:01,stocks,But is Doge a security? That's up to SEC to decide. The only coin that went through this SEC bs to prove it's not a security is Kin(if I remember correctly).
2021-05-01 22:24:41,stocks,Couldn’t be because they did literally nothing illegal. Must be GenericConspiracy.jpg
2021-05-02 00:37:48,stocks,Ya. They got margin called. You get what you get when you choose an app company as a broker

2021-05-02 05:29:56,stocks,"The explanation is that RH couldn’t pay the margins. The way it works is when you buy a stock RH buys it for you. Then it completes the transaction latter. Most times this works well and even makes them a little money. Somebody has to keep the lights on.

Anyway, the buy orders were happening so fast the RH claims they couldn’t afford to keep borrowing to purchase them. 

You ask why restrict only buying? For two reasons. The first is that the buy orders were the transactions RH couldn’t manage. The sell order volume was much much less.

Secondly, and more importantly, suppose RH suspended selling too. Imagine what you would do if you had a bunch of shares. RH blocks selling and buying. Shareholders everywhere begins to sell. People on RH are prevented from selling and wake up the next morning with a very big price drop they couldn’t get out of.

magnify all that with all the options leaning one way too. RH could not stop users getting out of positions without causing real losses. Yes users potentially lost when they couldn’t buy BUT there is a big difference between causing potential losses because of a crisis and causing real losses because of some sort of symmetry.

I think that the RH argument, the one they have been repeating, is that they did the best they could to protect their account holders during a unprecedented crisis. I think a jury would agree.

I don’t use, nor have I ever used RH but I haven’t seen any evidence they did something wrong or took an unnecessary action."

Crypto is different and far less regulated so unlikely they would restrict it as heavily. With crypto there is no intraparty settlement (DTC / NSCC) so the risk profile is different.

Nobody restricts selling because there isn’t much risk to the seller — the more you sell a risky security, the less you have of it on the books and the more money you have or are owed in receivables. Again the risk profile is different.

Consider this.....  if your goal in investing is YOLO and to ‘make FU money’, how strong of a capacity do you have to understand and appreciate risk management? How prudent of an investor are you? If you have a limited understanding the market, the mechanics of share delivery and custody, and exercising prudence by managing risk, no wonder you think there is a vast conspiracy to prevent people from buying these meme stocks"

2021-05-01 23:14:27,stocks,"To be blunt i doubt it.

From personal experience in courts, proving something is hilariously hard if not sometimes impossible.

As a kid for example i got caught smoking by the police, cigs and lighter confiscated. Of course since its a police building a case against me, my lawyer just takes it to court and asks police to prove it, later the whole thing gets so twisted that by end of the day officially i wasn't smoking anywhere and i couldn't even recognize reality. Police was not capable of proving a single freaking thing, cigs and lighter ? I was keeping it for someone else etc.

That was the instance i started to pay attention, unless you have solid irrefutable hopefully digital evidence, good fucking luck with proving anything. 

I laughed when Trump administration last elections sued and sued and sued, but i am not saying there was any election fraud, but even if their was, i didn't believe for a second they could prove it in front of the court what so ever. So the outcome to me was as predictable as it can be.

Same with Robinhood, first of all what laws and regulations are broken and how, why, when ? That point alone is hard to build a case with and i don't think anyone is building shit at the moment, experience with USA shows that you need a rock solid accusation and rock solid evidence for it to be worth it, as for example it just needs to be very easy to convict of.

For example i was reading of FBI very often letting crimes off the hook because sometimes the situation is so complicated that there is no fucking way court will even understand to be able to convict the criminal, especially if the crime is digital.

And what we have here, stock market, trading, short interest, short squeeze, brokerages and just gadzillion things. For us it might be easy to understand because we encounter the topic every day, but for past year i even looked at r/investing not being able to grasp what a short squeeze even is, i don't expect it to go better at any court what so ever. Can't explain it so 10 year old understands ? Probably not worth bothering with building a case.

And then we get to the point of Robinhood defense, first they are all going to shift the blame so they are never at fault, to DTCC and whatever the fuck they want, if that wasn't their decision and they just followed what was asked of them ? There is no case.

Next is proving that it was for ''frivolous and for personal gain'' or market manipulation and whatever, they are just going to whip out how much customers they lost, how much money the lost in all this debacle and clearly prove there was more damage done than gain. No case.

I can imagine only thing that can actually get them would be voice recordings, emails admitting to hardcore crime that peeks everyones interest, but as i said, i really doubt there is anything coming out of this thing.

Don't forget that Interactive Brokers CEO basically admited to market manipulation directly and that hasn't gone anywhere.

SEC works way differently than what i talked about here, so for them everything is possible especially when they can choose a judge that is not impartial etc. problem is SEC is never really doing anything though.

Initially i just wanted to say user agreement doesn't do anything, especially with the shit Robinhood been pulling past years not just with GME debacle, the shit they pulled is not even in their user agreement what so ever. People been whining about them a lot, i am not even sure anything there works by a law.

But i gotta say i don't think they will get a judgement day though."

You seriously think gamblers are only going to gamble $100? Yes. There are people who barely (if not at all) gamble in that subreddit. But at the same time, there are some heavy gamblers/speculators too. You really underestimate the power of gambling especially when the casino is closed.

Also, for a few thousand dollars for a GME contract, you can get hundreds of shares. That's still a huge demand in a supply/demand curve. Imagine each share costing $300 but 1 contract (100 shares) costing only $12k. For the cost of 40 shares, you are forcing the brokerage to buy 100 shares.

And if you bought calls before the wave (last year), a few bought each shares for 60 cents each. Spend $1000 as a YOLO on that and you forced the brokerage to buy over 1.6k worth of shares that on Jan sparked up to the hundreds.

Don't underestimate human stupidity and greed. Just look at dogecoin and all those other weird 'shitcoins'. When people are stuck at home with nothing to spend their money upon, they do stupid things. And that stupid money does add up if enough people do it.

Robinhood goes around this by constantly lend you money, when you are day trading or w.e multiple times, you are actually borrow multiple of your money from robinhood, even if you don't use margin. 

You could have 100 dollars, but if you trade back and forth 10 times in a day, you could have locked up 1000 dollars of robinhood money at the clearing house.

Traditional brokerages do not allow this."

For example let’s say it takes you two days to make something I want to buy (time to execute trades). It costs $100. So I give you $100 and wait to get it in two days. You have all the money you need, if the price tanks well good for you, you already have the money. If it skyrockets I’ve already locked in what it was going for so good for me. 

Basically if all the money is there to complete the transaction, what is the collateral for? Collateral is for debts."

2021-05-01 23:29:46,stocks,"I believe the clearance house would be hit first but the broker still has the obligation to provide cash commensurate to the volatility. Thing is, naked shorts are illegal but somehow there was a massive volume of shorts going on so what happens and who is held responsible for them would likely prove for quite the legislative battle.

Closing trading reduced the volatility and thus the collateral rh had to post. My understanding is if they didn’t close trading they’d have to post 3B collateral and if the shorting side of these trades bankrupted they would not be able to collect the shorts obligations to them. There’s a lot of legit criticism to be made of how the situation was reached and hopefully that does get fully covered"
2021-05-02 00:00:42,stocks,"You are looking at this the wrong way.

Robinhood is supposed to have liquidity to make sure a trade can execute. You, the user, provide this liquidity and the trade instructions.

However, the DTCC raised capital requirements to make trades on GME and related stocks. Robinhood didn’t have the collateral to meet these requirements. They don’t just hold traders money, they lend it out for margin trading and related activities. Selling the asset reduced this burden on them, but buying made it worse so they disabled buying."
2021-05-02 00:08:18,stocks,"That’s the issue - Robinhood can’t lock in the price at the time of purchase. In a market where prices are changing 5%+ by the hour, even a slight delay can cost them millions of dollars. Stock trades are cleared 2 entire days after the initial purchase, which is not something Robinhood has control over or can change.

Robinhood executes trades in batches, so while you may pay a specific price that’s locked in for you, the price locked in for Robinhood will be different because it’s locked in by batch 2 days later.

Simple example: person A pays $75, person B pays $60, person C pays $70 - all three trades happened the same day, but Robinhood didn’t execute trades until 2 days later for price $80. That means Robinhood pays $80*3=$240 for the three stocks, while the actual investors paid $205. This is a $35 “loss” for Robinhood but none of the investors lose anything. These losses are meant to be offset by 1. Equivalent scenarios where Robinhood ”wins”, and 2. the profits that Robinhood earns by routing these bulk purchases through large market makers. The issue with increasing price stocks is that you typically lose more than you gain, since there’s no limit to share price gains but a floor on losses. That’s why the collateral requests increase so much.

Robinhood is a trash broker and they literally didn't have liquidity to support the increased deposit requirements set by their clearinghouse. They have no control over the deposit requirements, and it's based on the volatility of their customers holdings, which was obviously off the charts. The deposit requirements 10x'd, and they couldn't afford it. There isn't anything unknown about this.

The reason for them not being able to fulfill sell orders on doge, probably similar levels of incompetency. I highly doubt they would be naked shorting one of the most volatile assets you can hold.

It literally could just be that some part of their system which handles order flow or verification of transactions was overloaded and went down due to the insane volume.

2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Should I be concerned my brokerage turned my ETF holding into a short position? Long story short (no pun intended) back in January I decided to open a Roth IRA account and I invested $12k into a clean energy ETF. After seeing the ETF decline in value to $11k, I transferred the Roth IRA account to a new brokerage & sold the ETF position, now converted into a mutual fund. I then bought xx shares of GME during the recent dip to $160. However, the day after GME opened at $150 before shooting up to $185 after hours, I was shocked to get margin called by the new brokerage 

The brokerage informed me, ""The recent purchase of securities in your account has created a cash call. If this call is not met within the time required by Regulation T, per Federal Reserve Board, portions of your portfolio may be sold to cover this cash call."" Reluctantly and without immediately reaching out to the brokerage for further clarification, I sold my GME shares that same day at $177 for over $1k profit (bringing my account back above $12k for the first time).

What happened next was even more surprising! I let $12.3k cash settle for the T+2 settlement period and assumed that I had been margin called because somehow the initial purchase of GME interfered with the settling of money from my sale of the mutual fund. Instead, after 2 days the mutual fund showed up again in my account as a short position! Now, I believe what happened is the brokerage bought the mutual fund position from me ""on loan"" instead of simply selling it. In one sense this seems to be great because now my account has roughly doubled in value to nearly $24k with the mutual fund short position showing up as a positive asset.

On the other hand, I still want to own xx shares of my favorite stock without risk of being margin called if GME drops in price again due to its inherent volatitlity. So really what I'm wondering is:

* Was the margin call a one-time-only occurrence while my brokerage was setting up the short position in my account, or can it happen again if the value of my stock holdings declines beneath the value of the mutual fund?
* Can I sell the (now $11.5k) mutual fund short position itself for an equivalent amount of cash?
* Why would they even do this to me instead of just seling the mutual fund flat out?
* What happens if I try to transfer the account again to another new brokerage? Would the short mutual fund position get transferred too, or would it have to be unshorted by my current brokerage before I transfer the other stocks and/or cash I hold in the account? 
* Ultimately, does having the short position held in this account as an ""asset"" a positive incentive to stay with this broker, or does it create a crazy ridiculous amount of risk of getting margin called & having to potentially put forward extra cash to cover if my stocks decline rather than agreeing to sell at a loss? (I got super lucky this time!)

I'll probably call the brokerage on Monday for answers but meanwhile it would be great if anyone who has experienced and/or has knowledge about this kind of situation could give me a better idea about what sort of unicorn or beast I might be dealing with! 

Thanks in advance,

2021-05-01 23:41:25,stocks,"How did you fund the GME purchase? Was it with settled cash in the account, or did you sell some of your mutual fund to pay for the GME. If you bought GME with unsettled funds, you’re buying in”good faith,” which means you’re buying with the understanding that you will hold your position until the funds settle. By selling GME so quickly, you likely triggered a good faith violation. 

Call your broker because it sounds as if you may have committed both free riding and a good faith violation here which could lead to the suspension of your account."

Idk what county you're in or the rules associated with trading where you are, and I'm not familiar with Firstrade. I'm guessing something happened that technically wasn't allowed to happen in a Roth, and they had to do some weird shit to make it work, and that caused other weird shit to happen. Call them. Slow down. I'd open a retail account to keep swing trading, you can't replace lost cash in a Roth until the next year. 

Good luck.

Edit: I'm not sure I can actually trade basic spreads in my Roth now that I think about it. I'd have to check. I do have a type of temporary margin on the account tho, not for leverage, but to allow flexibility in making trades.

Warren Buffett conceded that selling some shares of Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&.tsrc=fin-srch)) in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio last year was likely a mistake, with the company remaining a tech leader providing massive utility to users around the world.

What car technology?  But even if the Apple weren't imaginary, Tim Cook didn't invent the car either.  This is however now the third decade in which it's been rumored that Apple will stick their logo on someone's car.  Not an invention. 

Having a higher number of unenthused customers proves he's been uninspiring, not inspiring. And ""brand loyalty"" is a meaningless statistic in terms of customer delight.  It just means people bought the same old thing as last time.  It doesn't mean they like you.

Feel free to stay blind.  You believe 10x is a realistic expectation but you think being 100% passive and paying zero attention to market fluctuation is the best strwtegy? Good luck 10x'ing passively. 

Professionals are happy to make 5% ten times while you passively wait for 10%.  But what do you do when your holding finally goes up?  Your dogma says you can't sell, because that would be ""timing the market"".  So you hold, and watch it retreat.  One part of you knows that sucks, because you could have sold, and you wanted to sell, but the pithy slogan forbid you from trusting yourself.  Then it falls really sharply.  And you think, this is way underpriced, I'd be crazy not to load up.  But don't do that!  That would be timing the market.  So you wait.  And you miss the low.  And you rack up opportunity cost.  And you wait and wait.  ""time in the market"" you tell yourself.  Your capital is locked up, and while trades mostly sideways for a few quarters, you see a bunch of things you could have flipped, if not for the slogan, and your capital being frozen. 

The hero of the ""don't time the market"" crowd is Warren Buffett.  And guess what he does?  Yup, he tries his hardest to time the market.  Constantly.

> You just twisted the wording to fit your narrative honestly.

Wrong.  Buy and hold is what they tell suckers.  I was trained to say it and spread it and follow it.  Until I knew better.  Most who say it don't even know it's sales psychology gone wrong.  Buy and pay attention works better.  

Whatever stock you think buy and hold works for, I guarantee it has had prominent peaks and valleys along the way.  Hitting just a couple of those would have crushed a passive strategy."

I’m just giving you an example, I don’t understand why you got stuck on that point as I was referring to the assigned value you may come up with and exaggerated to make the point more clear. 

Most investors aren’t value investors. They say they are. Have you seen the market. The market is heavily overpriced and you think most investors are value investors. If a stock is overpriced you don’t buy, if it’s undervalued you buy. Is that the timing the market you referring to? Because I don’t understand what you mean by timing the market, you just sound like you referring to value investing in your description, which sounds the same as timing the market but really isn’t. 

When your investment matured or you hit your targets you should sell. But it’s very important to understand the meaning of these words. If you believe a company cannot grow any further you have hit the limit you sell. That’s what is value investing is about. You keep referring to value investing and you don’t even know it. Timing the market is for traders, they look at graphs and will ‘guess’ the bottom, value investing is simple, after putting some numbers here and there I think the stock is undervalued let me put some money there, a month later I did my calculations this severely overvalued okay I have a choice now do I see or wait for it to be undervalued before buying more because I still think I can increase my gains long terms, holding is because if you the value is higher than the dip than you hold, it’s for people with edgy fingers, who think value is none existent. If it’s undervalued hold, if it’s overpriced sell. There’s your timing the market. 

That’s just it. Warren Buffet doesn’t time the market he sees the current value and future value and buys when he sees it has value. That’s it."

No, as the article already made clear.  Anyone could have been plopped in to take over Apple, and it would have continued making money.  Making money does not make one the greatest CEO of all time.  

> Do you have proof that he’s not?

Yes. I actually wrote an article on that.

Wrong.  It's bizarre that you think that the consumer market regards him as the greatest CEO.  The consumer market doesn't even think of him, other than the punchline of ""Tim Apple"".

I think it’s hilarious that you think I could have taken over from Steve and Apple would still have GROWN to $2.3 trillion market cap.

You used an analogy of Secretariat which I think is extremely poor.  First of all, the jockey wasn’t given that much credit. Everyone knows Secretariat’s name.  How many people know who the jockey was?  Second of all, Secretariat is horse, with genetic make up + training that led to his success.  Apple is a corporation.  It only runs as well as the people directing it.  It doesn’t run on its own.

2021-05-02 00:00:00,stocks,"I don't understand how dividends affect a stock price. I read today that if a stock is trading at 20.04 and pays a .04 dividend, on ex-dividend day the stock will adjust down to 20.00 to reflect that dividend no longer being available to buyers. 

I got down voted to hell for saying it's not necessarily 1:1 like that, but actually now I'm just confused.  Is it actually 1:1 like that?  Does the stock price adjust down automatically by that exact amount? I was under the impression that prices were only affected by supply and demand.  What about open limit orders?  Do they automatically adjust down by that exact amount? I saw this somewhere. 

Or is it 100% due to market forces?  Since investors know they are no longer entitled to that money on ex-dividend day, they will naturally be willing to pay .04 less for the stock, thus they adjust their bid sizes accordingly. 

The info I'm finding online is not clear on it.  Some sources are saying it's automatic, some are saying it's market forces (or maybe I'm just being thick). Anyway, sorry for spreading misinformation in the other thread, but it would be cool if someone could actually clarify how this works.

Theoretically, when you take out $10 (dividend) from that pocket, you should have $100 left in that pocket (the company's worth after dividend). Market pricing, however, is not conducted with perfect information and by perfectly rational actors. Maybe the previous quarter the market undervalued the company so even after dividend the stock stays the same or goes up. Or maybe the market is now overvaluing the company. In any event, dividend in theory is just taking out money that you already have, hence whether a company offers dividend or not should not affect your investment decision in the company.

2021-05-02 09:43:06,stocks,"One key thing that everyone forgot to mention here is NETWORK EFFECT that we are going to see in the automotive industry. If you don’t know what that is, do a quick google search. That is the phenomenon that made Google, FB, Uber, and many such companies what they are. You also see this phenomenon in things you use, like a credit card. The value of these platforms come from the number of users. The more the number of users, higher the network value is and better the monetization of the platform.
In the EV world, the car is going to be a commodity product. The real value that consumers are going to see is the software, charging network and speed.
Let’s look at an example from self driving perspective from Tesla and how they have disrupted the space. It sounds similar to Apple.
If you buy a Tesla, you provide valuable driving data to improve the auto pilot software. The more people buy Tesla, the better the software becomes; in turn bringing more people to the platform. Then you have dedicated charging networks that all these people use. Someone to provider electricity to that network (which is another company that Musk owns). Now once you have control over every aspect of a car ownership, imagine the number of ways in which you can make money. You buy a car at factory price but pay Tesla for everything else. they get revenue/royalties from a service provider for that network. They also have massive bargaining power from it too.
Other companies cannot probably build their own network, so they have to adopt the open framework like Google. Now problem with that is many aspects are not under their control and probably not a lot of margin. They’d have to pay royalties for softwares and services which is other way around for Tesla.
Ultimately, as investors, it’s all about money and knowing what I know today, I think Tesla is poised to become the Apple of EVs. I don’t know what the Google of EVs is going to be. So my money is on Tesla. Not any other car manufacturer."

They just don't seem to get that Tesla and the other hot EV startups have a lot of growth potential, whereas GM will be lucky to just not lose market share if they successfully transition to EVs.

2021-05-02 12:47:41,stocks,"1st.maybe we should define ""soon"" first ?

2nd:extremely valid point. like in the traditional car  market, the market is not unlimited. the amount of money available to buy a car does not simply mutliply only because it will be an EV car.so basically  the same market growth that was predicted for traditional car manufacturers around the globe only 5 years ago is not moot anymore only because the actual engine technology changes.

even before the EV Hype, the overall saturation and growth for growing markets was quantified and calculated aka ""predicted"".

add on top of that the whole ecosystem that MUST be in place before EV ´s can even start substituting traditional cars and you have a whole different time frame.

this does not change growth directly, but hinders it indirectly. not many will buy an EV (and manufacturers know this and have known this all along) if they cannot recharge them at will. so why switch to EV completely ? would make no sense at all.

I personally think it is funny to see people argue about the tradidional car companies simply vaniosh out of existance only because some ""cool new kid omn the block"" show up with some fancy new toys and puts them on a rocket. 

do anyone of you remember how much fuel old cars used to need ?   
I remember not o long ago that some of the biggest companies claimed that it wasn´t possible to build a car thatonly needs 1l of fuel for 100k range. they said this, and already  had the patent filed and build a working prototype. 

when pressure from the public grew and all wanted to ""go green"", all  over sudden cars were available that needed less and less fuel. 

its not that they couldnt aor could not build cars that would need only 2 l of gas. its that customers simply do not want them. still SUV´s are the largest growing market of sold cars. SUV´s for crying out loud. 

yes, pressure grows and will keep growing. 

and as soon as it will make economical sense to fully transition, they will do so. some have prepared for this switch over for the last 10-15 years already. some have not. 

&#x200B;

**but**\- electrical net capacities need to be expanded to allow everyone who now owns a car reload a car when a needed.(currently power-nets would just collaps if only half the people would try to recharge their cars after work , and thats talking germany which has the best and most stable power infrastructure worldwide)

They're expensive, but if you don't have one you're screwed.  
We're running into an issue of people want the ability to move freely, but they also recognize that a vehicle is a huge financial drain.

Not to mention car ownership is still a big cultural and social class thing.

And per the checkup done every two years on it, nothing is even showing signs it might need to be replaced soon.

But with even the manufacturer optimistic estimates right now EV's battery on the other hand will be sufficiently degraded to require a change 8 years after purchase. That's a high cost that someone (even if it's the company, which then means the consumer pays more upfront to account for that) has to pay.

2021-05-01 20:30:45,stocks,"Some of this I agree, some I disagree.  

> The main point is not necessarily what these companies are doing today, but what they're doing for the future. 

When assessing ""the future"", it's best to look at what's most tangible and soonest.  In that regard, Ford has EV's you can order, tomorrow.  And receive in the coming weeks and months.  That's about as a solid a ""future check"" as you can get.  The demand is also very real, with long waiting lists and deposits.

> VW is clearly taking EVs very seriously, investing $118B in EVs vs GM's $27B and Ford's $29B.

The stat could be misleading.  Scale of the companies matters.  Also, spending doesn't equal revenue.  Some companies waste money or spend it more or less effectively than others.

> This already shows in the trends, where VW saw a 315% increase in EV sales in 2020 (although this was also partially due to a big new product release with the ID3).

Relative % aren't indicative of much, especially on a low base.  I could sell 4 cars this year versus 1 last year and claim 400%.  Ford's increase in sales of electric mustang is technically plus infinity. 

> With GM's and Ford it's almost impossible to find their EV sales numbers as they seem to be trying desperately to keep them hidden, 

??? No they aren't.  Ford was just pretty expository this week on their earnings, and GM earnings is next week.  By law, they can't talk during the quiet period.

> in reality they know they're too late to make the switch and go through multiple years of unprofitability with their terrible balance sheet without going bankrupt.


What are you talking about?  You're alleging that both Ford and GM, every board member, every executive, is knowingly committing fraud right now because they have this secret knowledge that they're going bankrupt but they're lying to the investors?  

Not possible.  

They think their transition is happening.  Whether it will succeed, and by how much remains to be seen.  But it's not credible to allege they already know bankruptcy is inevitable.

> Quantumscape is vaporwear, at least in the short to mid-term. Solid state batteries will be in technological lock-in for at least 5-10 years before it can catch up with lithium, and that's only if someone's willing to invest insane amounts of money to scale it up to mass production. 

Other than the ""vaporwear"" part, I agree.  But it's probably worse.  The lab concept doesn't go straight to megawatt car battery packs.  Even if it can be made into a prototype, that prototype will - at best - have to first spend some time moving up the ladder.  Maybe it starts as a flashlight battery product to see if any blow up or catch fire.  Maybe it moves to cell phones, where the high retail price can absorb the pioneering cost.  Maybe if it works there it can get scaled up massively to the degree of car battery packs.  But that doesn't happen in five years.  Maybe not even ten.  

If someone ever wants to know where something will be in five years, just compare where it was five years ago with today.  That's the predictable increment.  And EV batteries in 2021 haven't come that far since 2016 have they?

> And either way, ultimately VW, GM and Ford are all headed for some very tough times for the simple reason that they started the transition too late

While I'm personally surprised at how little they've done in recent years, being late isn't necessarily bad.  Especially with something like this.  Let others waste their billions trying to invent the product and solve all the hard glitches.  A nimble second adopter doesn't need to waste their time and money on those expensive hurdles.  

I imagine that Hyundai/Kia have been happy to let these other companies waste their dollars breaking ground and creating consumer demand.  Then they'll swoop in with their superior engineering of the already developed first generation stuff, make it better at a lower cost, and ravish the market.  

> their investors won't allow their companies to go through a period of unprofitability which is required to transition from 99% ICE vehicles to 100% EVs with high enough margins to make money 


Their investors have been content with decades of floundering, so maybe that won't change?



> and because they're still using dealerships that will refuse to promote EVs because there's almost no money to make from EV maintenance and they don't have the expertise to provide service on the software/technology part of the EVs.

The auto manufacturer and dealership model is ripe for change, but that's sort of a separate issue.  Your theory that dealership service will be extinct is debatable.  Over 90% of a car is not the drive.  It's the wiper motors, the power windows, the seats, the brake discs, the wheel speed sensors, the steering wheel, the fenders, tie rod ends.  It's a myth that EV's will magically not need service and repairs.  And it's worse than with ICE, because any mechanic can work on virtually any ICE.  But they can't even tough an EV without possibly killing themselves or triggering the firmware to self destruct.  EV drive trains are fragile and fine electronics, being slammed and bounced and dragged through sand and water and salt.  If they play it in the most greedy way, dealerships will be more important than ever.

Cars are rapidly going from something that can be serviced and repaired to insanely proprietary.  Dealers may be the only ones with the tools, interfaces, software to even touch the next generation of cars.  That's already the case with heavy equipment and agriculture."

2021-05-02 01:39:08,stocks,"Automakers tend to be developing two different avenues, and VW is one of the most prominent in using this strategy.

They're building EVs, but also dropping tons of money into alternative fuel options. Automakers aren't 100% confident in battery technologies ability to evolve the way they need them to.

VW's position is best exemplified in their race divisions approach to which series to race in. Audi pulled out of Formula E rather abruptly at the start of this season. FE has advertised itself as a test bed for battery, inverter and motor technologies. When VW entered Audi they saw it as an opportunity to put its technology to hard testing. While they haven't exited completely, Porsche isn't exactly a brand you see VW leading R&D with.

They've decided to enter Dakar and LMDh which are both hybrid series. As well VW has sat down with Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull Powertrain and Renault to discuss the 2025 F1 engine regulations, with VW pushing hard for a 100% Biofuel powered engine. F1 really wants new manufacturers and the other teams aren't too resistant to the idea.

I don't see us going 100% EV, ever. There simply isn't enough power generation on earth to make it possible without Fusion. It's a fact that regularly gets glossed over. There is also a theoretical limit to current better technology, which will cap their range. With recharging being a major focus point now.

Automakers like VW who are large enough to have their fingers in both segments, and lead the R&D charge in each is poised to come out ahead, one way or another.

It's also important to note VW has gone back on their promise to only build Works Entries for EV only series."

2021-05-01 20:02:49,stocks,yes a comparison of the motley fool to the NASDAQ would be more accurate
2021-05-02 05:50:52,stocks,"Wow so upselling is evil or at least “sketchy”. I’ll write a stern letter to McDonald’s. Those jerks are always asking, “Do you want fry’s with that?“ Bastards. 

I don’t pay for Motley Fool but I read a lot of their free articles. I don’t recall any time sensitive pressure tactics but maybe you are more sensitive than I am."
2021-05-01 20:04:21,stocks,could you compare motley to the NASDAQ
2021-05-01 22:43:48,stocks,Lol I would need some proof that they remove their “buy” recommendations. I am a subscriber and as far as I can see there’s no hole in all the historial data both from their spreadsheet and mine.
2021-05-02 04:37:55,stocks,Literally read the study in the post that considered their picks since 2002. There’s no cherry picking of data. If you have issues with the companies they pick then by all means point them out.
2021-05-02 09:05:21,stocks,You don’t have a paid membership so how do you know about their tacticsc
2021-05-02 10:18:59,stocks,"Fries are good, but they're not on the list of our 5 most recommended menu items- pay $100 to see it!"
2021-05-02 05:40:18,stocks,"It’s simply an ad hominem attack. He doesn’t like Motley Fool but can’t explain this data so he attacks the concept of likening Motley Fool.

It a very common technique in 2021, if I don’t like somebody I attack anyone who would even discuss it."
2021-05-02 12:11:15,stocks,"almost a good point. it Doesn’t make much sense that they (MF) would not give me the hard sell because I don’t give them money at all. It’s unlikely that their marketing department is sweet with no payers but are sketchy up sellers.

But I’ll tell you this even though I hate upselling and I make it a point to not buy an item after upselling. You, or they guy that said the upselling is sketchy have not produced anything but accusations. I don’t like that. I think the world wold be a better place if people stopped criminalizing behavior they don’t like.

I don’t believe upselling by itself is wrong  but nobody has documented anything like a sketchy or illegal upselling incident with Motley Fool.

All we have is evidence that a guy who probably works for a competitor has said Motley Fool has sketchy upselling practices. When I questioned that a second  guy, maybe also from a competitor, says my experience with the free product does not qualify me to say anything about the sketchiness the product because the upselling is different between products. I think the second guy would be happy if everyone who doesn’t agree with the first guy would just shut up and let them Kill MF.

So I got one guy who tells unsubstantiated story and I got another guy, maybe from the Sam competitor running interference.

Thats a little unfair of me isn’t it? I don’t know you or the other guy. I’m not a mind reader either. How do I know why you or he spoke up. Well that’s exactly what you do to this company. 

In English the word sketchy in this context means borderline illegal. A powerful and damaging accusation.  The guy said the company was doing almost illegal upselling, without evidence.

The only thing you could think to do is say my interactions with the company had no bearing with judgeing the companies practices.

 You leave me with the impression that you think giving a contrary position, even if not perfectly aligned, is much worst than people who may be telling lies or maybe people who don’t understand either upselling or the word sketchy."
2021-05-02 12:46:15,stocks,Sounds like a Fair offer but I think not. See how that works?
2021-05-01 20:25:01,stocks,"Rule breaker targets explosive growth but some of their stocks miss. Stock advisor has safer stocks and kind of established as good companies to invest your money in. If you plan to invest serious money, I would recommend to check it out and look at their stocks on their performance tab."
2021-05-02 06:05:55,stocks,"You are absolutely correct. I think some here think this is like a peer reviewed university paper or maybe a review of open source software.

Motley Fool makes money by selling proprietary information to buying customers. Insisting their proprietary information be open to the public for review is silly.

If you mistrust this review, and are a paying customer, then it is trivial to reproduce the report.

If you are not a paying customer and you mistrust this review then you can wait until there are more reviews or you can pay and maybe do your own analysis. It’s not like this is thousands of dollars.

But no, the OP was not obligated to reveal information he has no right to just so he can attempt to review the product."
2021-05-01 20:12:57,stocks,Interesting. US OTC symbol is DFMTF for anyone looking.
2021-05-02 00:02:56,stocks,"If he's near retirement then I'd recommend against being mostly in an s&p500 etf, VOO is good but if you're retiring in 5 years it probably shouldnt be more than 20% of your portfolio, safe is things like well rated bond funds, income from dividends in a company still making good money.

There's many good bond funds that can safely accrue 3%-4% making him not lose money to inflation every year and actually allowing him to make his money do some of the work. Of course always do your own research"
2021-05-02 01:19:51,stocks,Encourage your dad to talk to a CFP. Older people need a bit safer investments.
2021-05-02 02:24:29,stocks,This question is like ... a kid wrote it
2021-05-01 20:38:45,stocks,Isn’t Santander a Spanish bank?
2021-05-02 03:19:26,stocks,Ever heard of a small thing called Brexit?
2021-05-02 03:47:59,stocks,Yeah but I included them because they have a big presence on UK retail banking and listed on the LSE
2021-05-02 03:43:36,stocks,"That doesn’t really explain anything they’ve never been £10+ and HSBC is from Hong Kong, Santander is Spanish the prices dropped a lot in 2016 but picked back up"
2021-05-02 04:06:00,stocks,"But my guess is the insecurity about the GBP and Brexit are nonetheless getting them hammered. If they have such a large retail exposure or exposure to GBP, they will get priced in for that.

Just a guess.

I don't own any financial stocks for just the reason I don't have insight into what *actually* moves them until after the fact - if even that. They're fickle and rely on bascially all money streams and also strongly on outliers like policymaking.

A little crash on stock markets will - likely unfairly - send all of them down collectively, too."
2021-05-02 04:57:38,stocks,"You’re probably right I don’t think the 08-09 bailouts helped, a lot of bank branches are closing so it’s lowering costs and increasing profits but your right about policy making and regulatory changes they do have a big impact. I’m hoping what I’ve got stays in the green but I would like to see the price grow over time."
2021-05-02 05:05:03,stocks,"You can read for days (weeks) on what those bailouts and especially the large quantity of QE do to the monetary system - namely printing money, or rather ""booking"" the credits since it's all virtually created. This runs a higher and higher risk of overleveraging the financial system.

It's not 2009 that's the trigger, it's the continued leverage poured in by the two major central banks (Fed, ECB) since then and then doubling down in Q1/2020 that make the overall picture running hot and hazy right now."
2021-05-02 06:40:10,stocks,"It’s illegal to manipulate the stock market so your question is really asking for advise that details how to commit a felony.

in fact, you are asking me to participate in what may be a felony and I don’t even get a cut!

A better way to ask this question is to ask how to recognize illegal activity as you/we/I do fundamental analysis. Leave the details to the dark web, you could ask how to protect yourself which is a different question."
2021-05-02 06:31:42,stocks,"You are correct. Learning how to calculate intrinsic value, particularly if you try to factor in growth, takes a bit of an effort."
2021-05-02 06:32:35,stocks,You should write Cliff Notes.

2021-05-02 13:43:56,stocks,Also that etf holds 11/60 positions of ARKG which is okay but the weights are tiny in the 11
2021-05-02 13:41:18,stocks,Which country are you based?
2021-05-02 13:45:26,stocks,I checked it up earlier and it is there which is incredibly - thanks for the info. I’m in touch with eToro now to see whether they report the capital gains automatically like the other trading apps in Germany. 🤞

2021-05-02 03:05:41,stocks,"I am a fan of OKTA, but I dont like how expensive the stock is. 
Long term I still want to be invested in this space so I went with PING - they are very reasonably valued and have everything OKTA has since they recently shifted from their hybrid to full saas offering. They are market leader in the space with majority of fortune 100 using them and currently  shifting their focus on smaller companies and ramping up partner channels.

They tanked after recent ERs mainly due to impact of switching from licence based model to ARR and they reported their cloud based saas offering growing north of 20%.
With their valuation below 2bil it is a steal compared to recent acquisition of Auth0 by OKTA for 6.5bil."
2021-05-02 09:21:38,stocks,No one like Fortinet? It's the only one in the space that's currently making a decent profit.

2021-05-02 07:00:48,stocks,"I am a cyber security “expert”, I guess, and I started out disagreeing. I don’t care how big you are, many of the most needed security tools are too complex to develop in house. Even the DOD should start with some off the shelf  solutions.

But your investment advice is spot on. I’ve met somebody from many many Cybersecurity companies. Many times I’ve met the founders, CEO and principle developers. 

There is a huge amount of FUD in the space. Future feature promises are common and promises of growth are widespread. The whole world will be saved if you just plug in, and pay for, this box. No setup or maintenance needed!

As I’ve said, I’ve been in Cyber for a very long time so I don’t think it right that I own stock and participate in purchase decisions at the same time. But, if I could, I can’t think of one that is in my risk/reward range."
2021-05-01 20:39:08,stocks,No not at all. They just have had the biggest recent breach that I personally have heard of. Plus it wrecked the stock if you look at the chart and OP is asking about stocks
2021-05-01 20:10:46,stocks,I dunno what you’re talking about. If you double your money just like once a month you can start with $100 and finish year one with 200k in profits! Year 2 is when you can start yacht shopping.
2021-05-02 15:38:03,stocks,This is cheese
2021-05-01 21:19:49,stocks,">If you double your money just like once a month you can start with $100 and finish year one with 200k in profits!

2021-05-02 07:15:51,stocks,"Wow where to start. First, you claim that these HF traders are holding you down and the stocks they short are all great companies with oodles of profits. HF trading is bad how?

You make wild accusations so you need to back it up.

Second a transaction tax slows the velocity of money. All this talk is nothing unless it can explain how it wouldn’t slow things to a crawl.

Removing money from the system by a transaction tax causes less transactions. Less transactions means it takes longer to find the capital to flow where it’s needed. You can’t have jobs if its harder to find the capital to fund them. If you don’t have jobs then you can’t get taxes. If you can’t get taxes then you print money like crazy.

I, for one, think we should keep the markets running as efficiently as possible."

2021-05-02 07:35:32,stocks,"No it would not increase revenue. How many jobs would need to be killed to pay the tax. It’s important to understand that revenues are not linear. Particularly with a tax that breaks things so quickly.

We should understand the system we seem eager to break. We have developed a market where capital can meet demand and make rewards for risk taking. The market we created is sufficiently fair to attract investments without the fear of being swindled . This system is used millions of times a day.

Any action, even taxation, that makes the system less efficient Means the entire market is not operating at its best. That means lest jobs. And it means investors get less incentive to invest.

Do I buy a boat or do I put my money where the government takes all my money? Incrementally doesn’t make me feel okay at all. It’s no mistake that all casino’s make money on a small fractional percentage advantage of each transaction. A percentage smaller than Ms. Warren suggest we put on our job creators.

If a tax is so big that it significantly reduces the deficit then its big enough to have an effect on the activity it’s taken from. Do we really thing asset allocation  through a free (as in liberty), fair and fast market should be less efficient ?"

2021-05-02 11:20:12,stocks,"Really hard to call given current valuations. Though tech is a catch all for progress, its really hard to know which tech. For example, solar is going to explode as will battery installs. This is without a doubt, going to happen. But who specifically will make the money?

Ill go with Real Estate. With energy growing rapidly due to solar + batteries, globally we should see rapid improvements in living conditions. Dry areas can now condense water easily. Power is available to anyone for lower cost. Hydroponics will be trivial. Food supplies go up. etc.

All that means people will have more kids. Every time there is an energy revolution, it leads to more rapid population growth. Well you cant make more land (well... unless we get off the planet lol). Land and property should skyrocket the next 20-30 years. 

I also think we see a resurgence in retail space which has struggled the last 20 years. Malls and empty retail will shift to entertainment and social venues and I think people will have a lot more free time so they will go out more.

Then again I am generally an optimist... but I will go with real estate. Healthcare REITs, Residential REITs, and maybe commercial REITs if they have good financials."

2021-05-02 15:01:24,stocks,"This article feels like some old man white butthurt elitism in regards to the market. Yes, it's not supposed to be a casino, yes people need to be careful, and yes fee free brokers have attracted more small time traders. But this recent complaining from the bigwigs just feels like they are annoyed the retail crowd is gaining momentum and numbers. The stock market is not owned and available only to the wealthy elite. Stop turning your shiny rich nose down at the rest of us trying to make a buck. We are here. Deal with it. Sorry not sorry your market has become more accessible to all.

2021-05-01 21:48:59,stocks,"I have a day trading question

Let's say that for share X, I bought at 10.00 per share on 0900 and then I see the price dropping to 9.00 per share on 1000. So I decided to buy share X at 1030 with price of 9.00. Then I see that the stock X price is now at 11 on 1400 at which points I decide to sell. 

For this day trading, will this be counted one day trading or two day trading? In other words, I bought the same stock at two different times and then later sold it on the same date, how many times will this be counted as day trading? 

I would suppose only one as day trading but just in case for my future reference."
2021-05-01 22:53:54,stocks,Best small cap index fund with lowest expense ratio? My job doesn’t offer 401k so not limited to anything thanks
2021-05-02 05:10:14,stocks,"Hey,

Got a question regarding 401k vs personal portfolio allocations. My 401k investments go into a few index funds, mainly in tech / mid cap companies / consumer staples / etc. At the moment, my personal RobinHood portfolio has positions in overlapping companies like AAPL, MSFT. I’m wondering if it would be a wise idea to do something like this

•	⁠sell my overlapping stock positions in my RobinHood portfolio and use the equity gained to invest in growth stocks that aren’t in my 401k funds.
•	⁠up my 401k contribution since I’m only doing 4% which my employer then matches with a specific percentage

I just feel like it’s somewhat dumb to invest in overlapping companies in two accounts. I might as well buy them only in the 401k since I’m not even taxed there whereas my salary gets taxed before I can load funds into RobinHood. What do you guys think?"

They are undervalued by a large amount compared to others in the industry and have a very unique and diverse tech moat. If they crack out another 30%+ YoY growth quarter, they should hit the $25-30 range, and a 50%+ increase should send it even higher (this is what they achieved in Q4). Exceptional fundamentals and positioned to take full advantage of CTV and the overall upcoming boom in advertiser spending. Just my opinions, do your own DD. It’s personally my favourite hidden gem."

2021-05-02 03:20:49,stocks,"I been on DKNG from close to day one. Mainly because I had heard their service pumped so often on so many different podcasts that I was familiar with the name.

Don't gamble on sports myself, but I know its an absolutely addictive hobby.

Don't know much about SKLZ"
2021-05-02 07:45:57,stocks,"Don't know DKNG, but I'm long on SKLZ averaging at $15.12. Their platform is used by their subscribers for about an hour a day on average, more than social media.

They are working with the NFL to develop a game for the platform, and if it's successful then hopefully other professional sports follow suit. They currently have no debt but are spending most of their revenue on advertising their platform and to recruit new subscribers.

Their earnings are coming up Tuesday I think, so will be interesting to see how they go. I think mobile gaming, particularly in the competitive space, has a big future. They are well off their ATH so I think anything below $20 is good to buy if you plan to hold for a few years IMO, but would wait on earnings in case they dive back to around $12 like what happened recently. Or you can buy some before and some after the report.

Not financial advice."
2021-05-02 10:56:54,stocks,"Im bullish on DKNG, it makes up 16% of my portfolio. I tend to pick companies I am familiar with and a bunch of my friends use draftkings esp during football season.

EV/Sales 54 vs 64% GP. Their customer subscription grew 82% in Q4. Forward guidance I believe is around 50% YoY which is still nutty. 125% net retention. I believe they post Q1 earnings on Thursday this week. I also have a position but not a full one, DCA in because of their high valuation."

There's nothing wrong with some dude investing in VTI for 10 years. I doubt Buffet is trying to say you shouldn't **invest** your money. But we can't deny a lot of the robinhood guys, especially from WSB, tends to use ""investing"" in a gambling kind of way. This can be dangerous when people do it with their life savings.


Things like options, overweighting a single stock, day trading stocks, or having the whole portfolio in extremely volatile stocks, all of this is close to gambling."

2021-05-02 09:05:46,stocks,"The problem is trying to guess which companies are going to outperform 

a. your index funds

b. AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, etc

If you own something like VOO, AAPL is currently its largest holding at under 6%.  If AAPL stock goes on a run, VOO is going to rise considerably less than straight up owning AAPL.

The main question you need to ask yourself is if you think you can pick the next AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, etc.  If the answer is yes, then it might be better to sell off your current positions in AAPL and MSFT and invest in those.  

In my opinion, AAPL and MSFT are very safe bets for the time being.  The market is really whacky right now and I would be hesitant to sell those in favor of some other small or mid cap stock that you hope might one day join the ranks of the big boys."
2021-05-02 11:03:00,stocks,"Definitely max out your 401k!  And then open ROTH Ira and max that out as well at $6k/yr.

2021-05-02 08:15:58,stocks,"If you think that discussions about Ford investments is about people having things against Ford and making them a punching bag then your beliefs should tell you more about yourself than about Ford.

Ford is either a good or bad investment to many people. Their own circumstances define good or bad.  People talk about good and bad investments.

What are they saying? What do they think about fords debt or their future plans?  How bad do the Unions or pensions pushing the business?  It seems inevitable that the US will go mostly electric. How does Ford compare?   
The US will probably raise gas taxes. How will Ford deal with this compared to its competitors? What’s the balance sheet look like?

Normal people don’t “have things against” or make any stock a punching bag. They express opinions based on the facts important to them. Some facts make a company look good and some look bad.  Each individual, including authors decides what’s important to themselves.  
And finally, why is what other people‘s opinions effecting you behavior? They might be right or wrong but it’s your job to decide based on all the facts you can put together .

In more detail I was saying that truck people in particular have very big personal bias and preferences on trucks they like or don’t. In conclusion I think that some of these people would refuse to invest in Ford even if they had no reason not to (obviously hypothetically). As you can see in some of the comments it seems some people actually have a personal vendetta against Ford... and that’s what I wanted to start this discussion for, to see just how many people responded and commented with nothing helpful like “Found on Road Dead” or “Fords a crap car”."

2021-05-02 12:44:38,stocks,"What do you mean by the word “artificially”. The word is closely linked to man made or in your sentence caused by man.

Lets be clear. The entire market is man made and every action is artificially. So I can say with confidence, “I bought a share of Microsoft and that put an artificial pressure to increase the price. I also sold one of my energy stocks. That pressed the price lower.  Its legal and even good to signal the market with our artificial buys and sells .“

So no, it’s not illegal or even wrong to artificially but legal force a price to do anything.

I don’t think you understand the word “manipulation” in this context either. In this context, manipulation means illegal. Manipulating the price of a stock is illegal. When you accuse the hedge funds of manipulation you are accusing them of a crime.

You have taken it farther. You  describe hedge funds are evil because they do something you can’t describe in precise language. 

And that’s the problem you must describe the behavior that you think immoral and evil carefully and Precisely. It may be helpful to your cause if you can describe a law violation or perhaps change to help us understand what you think.

I’m here in this community because I hope to learn something.  I keep hearing that the people here believe the hedge funds are evil. I keep asking what exactly they are doing that piss you off and all I get are high sounding but meaningless words.

So you got my attention. I’m willing to listen. Explain what hedge funds do that are either illegal, evil or unethical. Precisely. Words like manipulation are categories not descriptors. I manipulated the price of Microsoft today, not only did I buy it but I recommended it to my friend.  Is that evil too?
