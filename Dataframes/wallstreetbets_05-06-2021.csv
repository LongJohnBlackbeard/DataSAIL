2021-05-06 19:37:22,wallstreetbets, Nice! I had bought $100 and $120 calls before the call. Covid testing not going to end anytime soon.
2021-05-06 19:26:27,wallstreetbets,Mostly based on covid testing and covid will be over soon enough. If you take away money from that their p/e will be more in line with the other company’s.
2021-05-06 19:32:35,wallstreetbets,"Regarding covid testing, record earnings, and yada yada yada…see QDEL.   Buy puts. Ouch"
2021-05-06 19:42:37,wallstreetbets,32% short as well. Doesn’t everyone on WSB love sending shorts to the 🌒? Let’s go!🚀
2021-05-06 19:40:16,wallstreetbets,I love this stonk!🚀🚀🌓
2021-05-06 19:44:24,wallstreetbets,I have some long calls as well. This is far more than just a Covid testing organization. Although the bears would like us to think differently. Let’s 🚀!
2021-05-06 19:36:26,wallstreetbets,"It would still leave PE around 14 if you take away all the dollars from Covid testing. Genomic testing will propel this company above the rest. Not to mention they will be studying different variants of Covid for years to come after the CDC contract. Definitely undervalued more than most. There are definitely some bear arguments, but over time Fulgent will deliver."
2021-05-06 19:39:41,wallstreetbets,QDEL is losing money and missing earnings estimates?
2021-05-06 19:12:26,wallstreetbets,"I bought it after reading that part of their strategic plan is to get even more into the shopping part of it. 

The idea being that white girls already go there to find the thing they can’t quite describe, so why not just link to where you can buy that shit directly within the post. If they do it right, PINS will go off."
2021-05-06 19:37:36,wallstreetbets,I’m definitely long on PINS.  All I’ve been doing is continue to average down my cost.  I too believe in the power of the online live laugh love vision boards.
2021-05-06 19:13:09,wallstreetbets,"Right in there with you, bad entry but I suspect this tech play is strong. 
Even as things reopen and events start up again Pins should do decent. An added bonus is that a business podcast I listen to notes that people often go to Pinterest when they’re about to spend money, ie. planning a wedding, trip, or party. This makes it a prime place for advertisers and not all have embraced the potential of Pins yet."
2021-05-06 19:22:35,wallstreetbets,I like this stock.
2021-05-06 19:22:12,wallstreetbets,"I love Pinterest as a platform and as a stock. Own 600 shares with avg cost of $16, so maybe bought in similar time as you? Also made a pretty penny on calls last year. I bought the dip on earnings day, and the next and the next and the next LOL. Now feeling a little screwed to say the least. But hey, I actually love the platform and use it a ton, and love the stock. For me this isn’t a risky stock, it’s a buy what you know. My fave of the social media-esque names, maybe because it’s not really social media. Also agree with you their earnings were great other than the user growth which is just some conservative reality given the reopening. But nothing wrong with growing faster in 2020 and making more revenue going forward on an already larger-than-forecast user base. Looking forward to the rebound, whenever that may come. 

Edit: I feel like I have to admit that I am a white woman lol. And I can’t say enough how much I love it... not sure what that says about me."
2021-05-06 19:13:27,wallstreetbets,I’m not long on commons yet. Biggest issue in earnings report is that they expect user growth to slow down and will start spending on advertising to reach new users. Ads are expensive. They have years and years worth of growth ahead but i’m not sure the market likes PINS at this price. I’m patiently waiting
2021-05-06 19:29:56,wallstreetbets,Long on it since it was $24/share.
2021-05-06 19:31:29,wallstreetbets,"I am waiting for it to come down a bit more to buy. Expecting more headwinds later this year (Fed tapering, dollar strengthening, more groth multiple crush). That said, I am super bullish long term. A social media and shopping platform without negativity. What's there not to like."
2021-05-06 19:18:57,wallstreetbets,"I have the exact same read on it.  I think this stock will pop. 

I even started using it and it’s way better than when I tried to use it 4 years ago and it was dog shit. 

It’s still a pretty confusing app but I like their mission"
2021-05-06 19:28:48,wallstreetbets,"Ha, I’m in 1000 avg $24. 

I did not know much about the company until a couple years ago and the more I learn about it the more I feel it’s going to succeed.  Seems like they have a nice lil niche cut out for themselves to compete against way bigger companies. 

Every woman I know uses it every day, but don’t know of a single male friend that does. That’s kind of concerning but also an opportunity cause I see that as yet another big area of growth for them. 

I have faith!! But then again I am just a person with no expertise."
2021-05-06 19:17:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that was definitely the only real negative I saw in their report. 

However I found it interesting that while growth is slowing (they said the pandemic accelerated a few years of growth, which makes sense) their average revenue per user is steadily increasing and they have barely tapped markets outside of the US. 

You may be right in the short term but I think this stock is a safe long play"
2021-05-06 19:40:23,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah for sure. I’ve started using it about a month ago. After about a half hour learning curve it’s really quite useful for product designers and as an inspirational tool.

Also I always click on the ads cause they look just like a normal post, just like on Instagram."
2021-05-06 19:38:08,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. I was introduced to it while studying architecture, it’s big in the design community for inspiration, even for men. For any home Reno as well, which will still be booming this spring. Plus the art, fashion, beauty, and pictures of alpaca.. 

We will rise again. Not worried. Other than my May calls, not so sure about those."
2021-05-06 19:08:30,wallstreetbets,"ASO finally making a move. I don’t think longs will wait for earnings to keep adding because the company just made it very clear it is bullish and buying its own shares in the secondary offering. Shorts will continue covering, margin calls in progress. 

PT $60."
2021-05-06 18:51:38,wallstreetbets,I’m sorry..   but hey the selling slowed down a little bit at the end of the day so there’s that.
2021-05-06 19:37:10,wallstreetbets,First one’s free
2021-05-06 18:42:12,wallstreetbets,"Not bad, remember to sell the losers."
2021-05-06 18:51:28,wallstreetbets,I would sell for sure brother. I had significant amount of shares and sold once it broke 70. Their guidance was really poor.
2021-05-06 18:54:27,wallstreetbets,Sell a may 21 80 call if you don’t want to lose all your money

Its less about nuclear power and more about a structural supply deficit that can only be solved on the supply side"
2021-05-06 19:02:56,wallstreetbets,"Great, now I have more stuff I barely understand to research. I read about that and plans to build reactors but have been struggling to get it to work. Uranium may just be the stop gap, but I'm wondering how long it will take them to build and scale up fusion reactors for offset or replace existing fission plants"
2021-05-06 19:06:55,wallstreetbets,"This is a structural deficit that is here today and has 100's of billions in capital already poured into infrastructure that provides 20% of the electricity to the us...A couple trials that MIT has run do interfere with this...anyways thats the Tokamak i brought up...all of these things take years to get approval to build, much less build out all the infrastructure for..."
2021-05-06 19:54:55,wallstreetbets,"did not know that but it lead me to this article.
https://www.iter.org/sci/FusionFuels

""A fusion reaction is about four million times more energetic than a chemical reaction such as the burning of coal, oil or gas. While a 1000 MW coal-fired power plant requires 2.7 million tonnes of coal per year, a fusion plant of the kind envisioned for the second half of this century will only require 250 kilos of fuel per year, half of it deuterium, half of it tritium.

Only a few grams of fuel are present in the plasma at any given moment. This makes a fusion reactor incredibly economical in its fuel consumption and also confers important safety benefits to the installation."""

2021-05-06 19:07:40,wallstreetbets,"As soon as fusion is cracked then uranium will drop hard. Comparing fission to fusion is like comparing coal to solar in terms of both operator and community safety.

The best feature of fusion over fission is that the reaction just *stops* when you turn it off. The plasma dissipates and the system is safe within microseconds."
2021-05-06 19:18:22,wallstreetbets,I'm in no way an enemy of nuclear. If it can be done with absolutely no risk of meltdown and there's an actual plan to deal with the waste (other than stick it in a hole and forget about the hole) then I'm all in. But I think massive costly investments into decades old energy solutions is a mistake when a literal juggernaut of power is just over the horizon. It'll produce 3-4x more power on average.
2021-05-06 19:13:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, just anything referencing a microcap remove.  The rest seems fine since you seem to have put a lot of work into it.  Idk, I didn’t read it, too ADHD, just did !info to get the bot to tell me what tickers are mentioned."
2021-05-06 19:24:45,wallstreetbets,Many thanks fren!
2021-05-06 19:18:16,wallstreetbets,"Not saying it's not possible and I'm going to read into this further, but it seems like this tech is pretty far out still. I picked it up when I started looking at nuclear power a few months ago and the timelines were looking at 10-30 years out. Thanks for prodding me to look back into this though"
2021-05-06 19:28:10,wallstreetbets,"biden just announced subsidies for nuclear power plants, the advanced reactors he talks about i think are SMRs not fission, although when that comes it would be way more efficient...they dont really meltdown, that is just a hydrogen explosion as explained above. the more advanced ones get into tricky political situations, they require more highly enriched uranium in order to keep creating more fission reactions, which we dont want other countries to have. You can also re enrich the tail assays and greatly cut down on the waste...either way it is way better for the environment than other types of enegy"

2021-05-06 19:29:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m not buying it. The stock is dying and he’s doing his best to keep the apes hyped. Why did he get a 4 million dollar bonus during the pandemic? Why is he diluting the stock from **137 million** shares outstanding in October to over **450 million** now? Screw him
2021-05-06 19:32:38,wallstreetbets,"He's just pandering because it's peanuts compared to his recent bonus.

Adam straight up sounding like a used car salesman telling you how beautiful their ‘92 Camry is, while their financial guy whizzes through their balance sheet only focusing on the positive numbers. 

Of course they’re going to fawn over retail that owns 80% of float, they have to do it to keep the share price up in order to sell the 25.5 million shares they’re still sitting on for a premium. It’s their only ticket to long term recovery from impending bankruptcy.

Then was about to further dilute the float but got shit on for it.

But the big thing is this, what have they done?

GME has a plan for the future, what about AMC? Any new c-level additions?

Any plans to reinvigorate the industry? (Movie theaters weren’t exactly big money makers BEFORE the pandemic...)

Anything? Any plans besides half-asses attempted to save face with the retailers who bailed their asses out? Oh boy they donated 50k to apes... after multi-million dollar bonus’ to themselves for doing jack fucking shit and taking the credit for retailers bailing their asses out. They were going to go bankrupt, and it seems they have no plan to prevent that in the future except hoping retail saves them again. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad the apes get $50,000 more in funding, but its quite obviously a PR move and doesn’t inspire any “real” confidence in the future of AMC.

And also, I do hope AMC takes off for you guys, but damn... they aren’t doing much to make it happen."

2021-05-06 19:13:20,wallstreetbets,You obviously haven't been following the ins and outs of AMC over the last year.   Comparing GME and AMC is idiotic.   They are completely different companies in very different situations.   It just happens that they are both shorted to hell.  Adam Aron is the most engaged CEO I have seen.

GME has brought on tons of fresh blood, has announced drastic changes in e-commerce operations and retail locations, has put forth plans for transition into online+customer focused in-store experiences.

sounds like a lot of bullshit. lmao. 

AMC revenue went up from 2.9 billion to 5.47 billion in the 5 years that ADAM ARON has been CEO. ADAM ARON has a PROVEN track record. Movie theatres arn't going anywhere, they're connected to HOLLYWOOD and all FILMMAKERS.

2021-05-06 19:36:37,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, idk. We may well be at the start of an epic economic expansion. That means more multiple crushes. And some of the names I like have P/Es of over 200. Not the best time to own those. 

Add Fed tapering to that (probably later this year) and the resulting dollar strength and you get more pain.

I will wait this out and buy strategically where I see long term dominance ($PINS, $NET, $CRWD, $MSFT)."

2021-05-06 18:45:24,wallstreetbets,I agree with OP. I have several growth stocks that have lost +40% from their ATHs. I'm watching closely to see if they have finally hit strong support for a rebound while I slowly increase my position.

2021-05-06 18:29:26,wallstreetbets,$DOCN is in the same boat.  I don’t expect a lot till next quarter when we can see how they perform after going public.  $RBLX will probably make a crazy jump if they post beats at the next earnings.

2021-05-06 18:54:57,wallstreetbets,You can't make a statement like that without explaining yourself.
2021-05-06 18:32:31,wallstreetbets,"Since they haven't had there earnings report,  we can only go back to their filings which they both lasted a loss on the Financials as well as listed under risk factors that they are currently non profitable and will likely remain for near future.  They also list the likelihood that it will be difficult to repeat the subscription demand yoy due to the high demand during covid.  So right now,  it's an assumption that they are still unprofitable as well will find out next week.  But if I were to gamble,  the odds based on their own guidance and statements would say it's more likely they report a loss than a profit."

2021-05-06 17:32:32,wallstreetbets,Am I crazy for thinking Vlad looks like the evil twin of DFV
2021-05-06 18:54:03,wallstreetbets,"This is a great question, thank you for asking it. Perjury is absolutely very serious and I'd once again like to take the opportunity to thank you for using our time to ask me about it, it means a lot. Unfortunately I'm out of time."

2021-05-06 19:35:12,wallstreetbets,His haircut is perjury
2021-05-06 17:35:45,wallstreetbets,"That charge only applies if you have a net worth under ~9,000,000"

2021-05-06 18:43:33,wallstreetbets,Whoops! Someone call the Justice Department. This one might actually do something about it.

2021-05-06 17:26:04,wallstreetbets,"Were his lips moving,  then yes,  he did."
2021-05-06 19:07:30,wallstreetbets,His answer is carefully worded enough to bypass perjury even though we know he is being disingenuous with the truth.
2021-05-06 17:54:44,wallstreetbets,I just think of Snape everytime I see him
2021-05-06 19:15:46,wallstreetbets,"Vlad is a scumbag for lying on market news saying he didn't have a liquidity problem. But none of the statements made in this clip contradict one another, and other brokerages limited buys of GME because of the same liquidity problem."

2021-05-06 18:02:07,wallstreetbets,"How is that perjury? Fuck Robinhood to death, I hope their IPO tanks and everyone leaves that shit broker for what they did but I don't see how that's perjury. Of course the DTCC isn't going to go directly to the broker and tell them to restrict trading. They did it to comply with the new margin requirements and save their asses. That's not perjury"
2021-05-06 17:52:09,wallstreetbets,cant wait for this to get removed

This will absolutely recover to atleast $10.50 - $11.50. 

Its not the WSB way but this is a very strong investment. There is a 5% dividend. Combine that with selling calls.

Earnings call is on Monday BTW which will be at an all time high."

If you bought in now at $7.20 and the shares return to expected value at $12 then the dividend value would be inversed to your fabricated scenario. You would also sell options.

2021-05-06 17:59:50,wallstreetbets,I’ve got some SPCE for sale.  I’ll make a good price for you
2021-05-06 17:07:39,wallstreetbets,Margin. The dividend pays the interest and then some.
2021-05-06 17:38:08,wallstreetbets,Because he's double knuckle deep
2021-05-06 17:33:39,wallstreetbets,"I got 25k in my account, currently it's keeping me above the margin line, I've been riding it all day 🏄"
2021-05-06 17:17:56,wallstreetbets,I thought that is exactly how WSB works 🤷‍♂️

2021-05-06 18:15:37,wallstreetbets,"Apples to oranges. RKT was a P&D.

This is boomer stock meant for solid - steady returns."
2021-05-06 17:18:23,wallstreetbets,"bro, do what i do with PLTR... everytime the stock goes lower, i just keep buying more shares to bring my average cost down. thats how it works"
2021-05-06 17:23:44,wallstreetbets,What about it?
2021-05-06 18:19:11,wallstreetbets,Fair enough I didn’t see that. Must be new. I’m sure there is a reason it was clarified.
2021-05-06 18:22:33,wallstreetbets,"Surely that would depend on the size of your account. I didn’t see the portfolio diversity though,  if they used margin I’d take it back. In my eyes a true yolo is options"
2021-05-06 17:04:19,wallstreetbets,Yea
2021-05-06 18:55:10,wallstreetbets,Source? Or is this in reference to RKT not UWMC?
2021-05-06 17:36:37,wallstreetbets,All tapped out and ain't got no more money to average down with. Gotta sell me some covered calls and wait
2021-05-06 17:43:03,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, little bitch"
2021-05-06 17:44:40,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit I’m talking to a GME autist who missed out on profits above $300 twice now, goodluck retard"
2021-05-06 19:47:18,wallstreetbets,He's referencing RKT. They revised there outlook down 20%. UWMC is wholesale and likely won't be hit as hard.
2021-05-06 17:47:26,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Good luck to you too whatever the fuck you're doing

2021-05-06 16:57:31,wallstreetbets,Risk is the only way I still feel alive.
2021-05-06 17:02:29,wallstreetbets,Risk appetite has already fallen along with peak recovery. That’s why we are bleeding red
2021-05-06 18:17:49,wallstreetbets,"No shit, that's how this works. How did it take and how much was spent to figure that out? Fed and sec suk balls"
2021-05-06 16:56:54,wallstreetbets,This literally says risk is bad .. why are you in this sub? Long term blue chips are in /r/Finance
2021-05-06 16:52:43,wallstreetbets,"A rising appetite for risk across a variety of asset markets is  stretching valuations and creating vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial  system, the Federal Reserve said in its semi-annual financial stability  report.

“Vulnerabilities  associated with elevated risk appetite are rising,” Fed Governor Lael  Brainard, the head of the Board’s financial stability committee, said in  a statement accompanying the [report](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-may-financial-stability-report-purpose.htm)  released Thursday. “The combination of stretched valuations with very  high levels of corporate indebtedness bear watching because of the  potential to amplify the effects of a re-pricing event.”

In this environment, prices may be vulnerable to “significant declines” should risk appetite fall, the Fed report noted.

Brainard and the report mentioned losses at banks  stemming from dealings with Archegos Capital Management, and the  governor called for “more granular, higher-frequency disclosures.”

“The  Archegos event illustrates the limited visibility into hedge fund  exposures and serves as a reminder that available measures of hedge fund  leverage may not be capturing important risks,” she said.

Near-zero interest rates and massive bond  purchases, with the Fed buying $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities  and $80 billion in Treasuries every month, have fueled a search for  returns and helped buoy asset prices including for risky investments  like speculative stocks, crypto currencies and high-yield debt. The  Standard and Poor’s 500 stock index has risen 11% this year.  


### Spacs, Meme Stocks

“Indicators  pointing to elevated risk appetite in equity markets in early 2021  include the episodes of high trading volumes and price volatility for  so-called meme stocks -- stocks that increased in trading volume after  going viral on social media,” the report said. “Elevated equity issuance  through SPACs also suggests a higher-than-typical appetite for risk  among equity investors.”

Low  rates are also impacting the real economy. Home prices are up 12%  year-over-year amid high demand for property and scarce supply, while a  boom in home remodeling has helped push lumber futures to record highs.  The Bloomberg Commodity Index, which tracks everything from grains to  natural gas and nickel, is up 19%.  


The report said house-price increases have had a positive effect for borrowers by boosting equity. Still, it noted  that borrowers in forbearance programs, who are likely to be employed  in industries hard hit by the pandemic, could be vulnerable when they  exit. “Even so, a large fraction of borrowers have already exited  forbearance—in general, these borrowers have loans that are either  current or paid off,” the report said.

The report also noted  that low interest rates have reduced default expectations, and  underwriting standards have weakened. “The share of newly issued loans  to large corporations with high leverage -- defined as those with ratios  of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and  amortization greater than 6 -- has exceeded the historical highs reached  in recent years,” it said.

### Hedge Fund Leverage

The  report said that “available data suggest” that hedge funds are highly  leveraged, and said there is a need for greater transparency on opaque  risk exposures, echoing Brainard’s call for more transparency.

“Some  hedge funds with substantial short positions sustained losses during  the meme stock episode in January 2021, when intense social media  activity contributed to fluctuations in the prices of some specific  stocks,” the report said, probably a reference to the short squeeze in  shares of GameStop Corp., which soared to more than $300 a share from  around $20 a share in a matter of days."
2021-05-06 17:14:14,wallstreetbets,"I wish everyone here would see this. 

Sure we are here to risk and get reward. Every trade is a risk. With everything pointing to a correction/crash I don't understand why more are putting their risk into puts."
2021-05-06 17:06:01,wallstreetbets,"To the people telling me to move to r/SecurityAnalysis and that risk is life:  I'm just sharing with the sub what the FED's saying about the market, especially with respect to SPACs and Meme stocks. The headline doesn't necessarily reflect my opinions on the subject."

Amazing benefits. 5 year apprenticeship. Worth your time. Find your local in your nearest major city and find out when they are hiring. It's usually once or twice a year depending on area. If you live in NY disregard.

2021-05-06 18:36:16,wallstreetbets,i cant lose 21 years of work in a day.  lol i sold most of what i had left.  considering my luck i expect the stock should shoot up now for you RKT holders!!
2021-05-06 18:27:01,wallstreetbets,i know lol
2021-05-06 18:25:17,wallstreetbets,ill be honest i do not understand how taxes work regarding stocks.  i expect ill owe taxes even if i lose it all.  my expectations are very low lol
2021-05-06 17:42:13,wallstreetbets,Unless it’s invested in a tax free account
2021-05-06 17:23:16,wallstreetbets,"It’s not a form of tax credit. You can deduct it against your regular taxable income so unless he makes a $1000,000 a year and deducts that 4K or 3k yearly from his regular taxable income of about 39%, That money is in essence gone since his tax bracket at Wendy’s is probably like 10-15% depending on the state.

2021-05-06 19:44:18,wallstreetbets,i bought in 2 weeks ago at .50 per contract.  the contracts went up to 1.07 day of ER.  AH bad things happened.  This morning contracts are worth .04-.06

2021-05-06 19:26:19,wallstreetbets,"Sad. There are many things you can do without a degree. My son is making $200,000 plus selling cars. Chevys no less. Change your mind, change your life. Or not!!"
2021-05-06 18:27:04,wallstreetbets,"Man, go be a laborer in construction or something, you'll make easily twice that amount with benefits, paid time off, etc. You can move up as fast as you can learn (equipment operator, foreman, etc.) And quit gambling, it takes way too long to save any money on minimum wage."
2021-05-06 19:27:59,wallstreetbets,Have you thought about joining thetagang? I work in retail and selling contracts has helped me build up my portfolio and generate income that really helps me out when combined with just my retail paycheck. You can use the premiums to slowly build up enough money to do larger plays and then use the premiums to help pay down any debt you have and as supplemental income.
2021-05-06 18:26:38,wallstreetbets,You don’t need skills to make money

2021-05-06 18:44:44,wallstreetbets,But at least you have no debt so that’s good
2021-05-06 18:41:40,wallstreetbets,That’s why you have more savings than the guy that posted.

2021-05-06 19:01:56,wallstreetbets,Ive only been at wendys since covid started.  I am a team lead and should be getting my first raise soon if i stick with it.  I am looking into other work right now that will hopefully pay more.
2021-05-06 18:47:55,wallstreetbets,"i had 2 medical emergencies 9 years ago and I maxed out 3 credit cards and now an upstart loan of 10k to cover it.  i was ""hoping"" (dumb) i could turn profit and use it to pay down debt.  the universe has other plans.  honestly i do not know how to get out of the hole, but I am used to living on little so I am not worried as weird as that may sound.  I took a chance and it didnt pay off.  I don't regret finally taking a chance after watching the market the past 2 years.  my timing and choices were off"
2021-05-06 19:21:51,wallstreetbets,After that much experience you should at least be a manager some where
2021-05-06 18:34:08,wallstreetbets,Call every union in your area and see who is accepting apprentices. Your life will change.
2021-05-06 18:56:03,wallstreetbets,"I don't work for a union. We have day labor places, show up if you want to work, if you don't want to, don't show up. You get paid by the day, not much more than minimum wage.

That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about established construction companies in the area. Full-time employees, they almost all offer benefits and a livable wage. They are one of the few areas I know of for unskilled people to make more than minimum wage."
2021-05-06 18:54:50,wallstreetbets,I'll pass on taking deal advice from you.
2021-05-06 19:29:15,wallstreetbets,"i have been a manager 3 times now at 3 different places.  I've heard manager jobs pay more but I have mostly worked food service for small mom and pop stores.   Mostly on a bonus structure that was min wage + bonus based on sales compared to employee hours.  I found I wasn't good at managing people or hitting numbers the owners wanted.  not making excuses, it is entirely my fault.  i was not a good manager, too nice and forgiving of people to be a manager, also never hitting the numbers owners wanted to see.  Ruthless people make far better managers, at least as far as the numbers go.  again not making excuses, just reflecting on situations that didnt work out."
2021-05-06 18:37:06,wallstreetbets,"thank you for the advice, i will add this to my list to do.  seriously thank you!"
2021-05-06 18:59:47,wallstreetbets,as you should lol.  i try not to give anyone advice.  sorry if it came across as such.
2021-05-06 19:51:36,wallstreetbets,"self reflection is good, but ruthlessness doesn't make good managers.  holding people accountable does.

you've gotten some pretty good advice here.  I would recommend learning a trade or reaching out to local unions in your area.

Even go construction.  They work great hours and get paid well.  Manual labor keeps your body strong over the years and its a very social environment.  They often have great pension plans too"
2021-05-06 19:22:52,wallstreetbets,I second this.  An apprentice/manouver union job pays like 32$ per hour around here.  But it's hard work.
2021-05-06 19:09:18,wallstreetbets,Just a joke!  Hope things turn around for you
2021-05-06 19:57:29,wallstreetbets,"i learned a lot from this experience, and many many people have offered wonderful advice.  I appreciate the kindness.  It showed the post was deleted when i made it because the image included SUNW.  I took a break at work and saw it was undeleted.  I was expecting most people to call me an idiot but most people have been offering great advice.  Long time lurker of this sub, I was not expecting anyone to offer any help or guidance.  I am taken aback by the kindness I have been receiving today."
2021-05-06 19:35:21,wallstreetbets,i just signed up on a list for 2 different apprentice opportunities i found.  Thank you for taking time to offer me advice
2021-05-06 19:12:32,wallstreetbets,ok:) im in a bit of a state of shock right now and it went right over my head lol
2021-05-06 16:47:18,wallstreetbets,Haha I LoLed at CRUEL dip 😆😆
2021-05-06 16:52:07,wallstreetbets,Chuckled quietly to myself whilst watching dumb & dummer 2 with the kids.
2021-05-06 16:47:18,wallstreetbets,what movie is this from
2021-05-06 16:49:07,wallstreetbets,Balls of Fury
2021-05-06 16:50:24,wallstreetbets,"ty, flaired"
2021-05-06 16:51:31,wallstreetbets,"My first flair 😂 love it, thanks!"
2021-05-06 17:07:09,wallstreetbets,"Probably a stupid question but how are you down on the calls with a lower strike but the same expiration date while you're up on the ones with a higher strike? And congrats, well played.
Edit: didn't see the w, guessing that means you sold those on your platform?"
2021-05-06 16:39:03,wallstreetbets,"I am a bot. A Gain/Loss/YOLO should be a picture of a closed gain, a closed loss, or an open position > $2,500."
2021-05-06 16:45:56,wallstreetbets,Well played.
2021-05-06 16:54:35,wallstreetbets,Beautiful work my friend absolutely spiffing
2021-05-06 17:29:59,wallstreetbets,Can you explain to me your strategy of having all these different calls at different strike prices for 3 different dates?
2021-05-06 17:42:58,wallstreetbets,🦾
2021-05-06 17:47:24,wallstreetbets,"I mostly trade vertical spreads, so I sold those ones"
2021-05-06 17:29:38,wallstreetbets,"I think maybe he bought them at different times, where some were valued higher?"
2021-05-06 17:54:06,wallstreetbets,"yup, I trade vertical spreads -- I buy a call and sell a call at a slightly higher price. E.g.,

if Nue Price is $70

I would:

Buy $75 strike

Sell $80 strike

Pro is that you can take the proceeds from the $80 call to fund the $75 call, Con is you miss out on the gains on a price movements above $80."
2021-05-06 16:40:39,wallstreetbets,Isn't the meeting on 6/9?  Its a pretty relevant and memorable date.
2021-05-06 17:00:53,wallstreetbets,6/9
2021-05-06 16:35:25,wallstreetbets,"Side note… if you’re in Grapevine, TX… you could just walk in at 10 am!"
2021-05-06 17:16:54,wallstreetbets,"Did Melvin Capital get Margin called or not? I guess during the congressional hearing, some guy said that no one was margin-called in January. Is this true or fake news? Thanks!"
2021-05-06 16:40:40,wallstreetbets,"besides the first two comments being retarded as fuck and made me almost not continue to point three.

3.  I want them to address the shareholders which they have ignored for the last 4 months. We have held and supported the company like noone has ever done in history of investment, yet the only thing we get is single picture tweets from RC. I feel they owe us something more than cryptic memes at this point. HFs are manipulating the company's downfall while we are literally forcing it's uptrend, yet there's no clear communication, comments, anything from Gamestop.

&#x200B;

I am used to feeling like a cheap rag, but this actually makes me feel dirty"
2021-05-06 17:53:43,wallstreetbets,6/9 how could u mess that up
2021-05-06 17:19:20,wallstreetbets,What are we hoping to get out of the meeting? How does this impact our position?
2021-05-06 18:46:19,wallstreetbets,"Lets meet on the corner of Western and Normandy at 9am on 9th to watch the meeting online.  Bring drinks, I;ll get the tacos"
2021-05-06 16:56:36,wallstreetbets,Us retards are going to Dallas
2021-05-06 17:20:39,wallstreetbets,"Yes, looks like he edited it to say so at least but how do you fuck up 6/9??"
2021-05-06 16:55:18,wallstreetbets,I live in grapevine. Unfortunately I have to work that day.
2021-05-06 17:29:22,wallstreetbets,DTCC confirmed no margin calls happened in January
2021-05-06 18:35:39,wallstreetbets,https://v.redd.it/4grqlgl8sjx61
2021-05-06 19:09:15,wallstreetbets,They have huge liability making‘forward thinking comments’ about the stock. The fact they acknowledge us and that Congress is curious about us is good enough for me.
2021-05-06 16:45:32,wallstreetbets,In my opinion... They are aware of our support.  But why give away the play book to the enemy/opposing team in advance.  I think the date of June 9th speaks to us clearly.  Why else pick that date?   Patience Padawan.
2021-05-06 18:52:58,wallstreetbets,They will have better options going forward if we vote and they tally more votes than the float. They could use that as evidence that their stock is being messed with if they decide to take action.
2021-05-06 17:32:20,wallstreetbets,Bro GameStop literally told shareholders what to do. They stated to place your votes ASAP and recommended that shareholders vote “For” the board’s recommendations
2021-05-06 16:43:44,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, there is nothing wrong with thanking your shareholders."
2021-05-06 18:01:33,wallstreetbets,Hit the wrong button…
2021-05-06 17:49:45,wallstreetbets,You should take that day off...go in to represent yourself and suggest pushing for a share recall. Then you MAY not have to go back to work
2021-05-06 17:29:53,wallstreetbets,Oh shit!! Lol
2021-05-06 19:00:50,wallstreetbets,That must mean they didnt cover right?
2021-05-06 19:50:22,wallstreetbets,"They did not. Probably has nothing to do with 2 billion dollar investment they received.

Tin foil hat time. They received the investment prior to DTC increasing collateral requirements. Either coincidental or they were tipped off. Actually, someone powerful made a call to the DTC and had them pull some strings.

What did they do with that money? Stave off a margin call and give them time to reposition so citadel wouldn't be next in line for that call."
2021-05-06 17:13:10,wallstreetbets,"“Playbook” heheheheHAHAHAHAHAHA… god, you guys are idiots HAHAHAHAHAHA"

2021-05-06 17:51:08,wallstreetbets,My best advice is always keep cash in your account.  Use it for dips. In and out.
2021-05-06 19:09:52,wallstreetbets,">You will pay capital gains tax on it yearly, but that just is what it is.

Bold of you to assume I'll make profits"
2021-05-06 17:20:10,wallstreetbets,"TL;DR = be responsible, understand tax and do proper DD. This kinda work load makes losing money more appealing 🙃."
2021-05-06 17:31:38,wallstreetbets,"Cut your losses at 16%? Nah, that's when you buy that glorious dip. If the stock was worth buying in the first place, it's definitely worth buying with a 16% off discount"
2021-05-06 16:43:25,wallstreetbets,Great post! .... But I have to question your position on RKT you didn’t sell BECAUSE you believed it had much more potential than $43 and YOU didn’t know it was going to go back down to what you bought it at..... Hindsight.... another story you could’ve wrote was you were pissed you took profits on RKT at $43 and it shot up to $89
2021-05-06 17:18:42,wallstreetbets,"Usually price will go up as soon as you cut your losses. If you believe in a company, you better average down imo."
2021-05-06 17:44:23,wallstreetbets,"Best post I read here in quite a while.
Wish I read it 2 wks agora before burning 50% of my portfolio. Well, I wouldn't have learned this any other way tbh."
2021-05-06 18:10:15,wallstreetbets,"Good post bro thank you, or you can just use uno cards and the magic 8 ball works every time."
2021-05-06 19:04:37,wallstreetbets,Great advice for new retard like me. Learnt the hard way in the last few weeks.
2021-05-06 17:33:03,wallstreetbets,Lambo or ramen noodle. No in between retard.

2021-05-06 17:52:11,wallstreetbets,"ETFs are great if you don't have the time to follow things (which I didn't most of my career) or if you need stability in your nest egg near-term. Hell, I would rather even just throw money into my favorite FAANG-ish (add AMD, NVDA, MSFT and toss Netflix) stocks if I had a little time to follow the market (as I do now) and don't need my  money right away.  


Believe it or not, there's plenty of ground between ""Throw it into a vanguard 2060 and get 6% a year for a few decades a nd hope that's enough"" and ""YOLO, betting it all on SKLZ!"""
2021-05-06 19:50:30,wallstreetbets,Disagree about ETFs. See all ark funds which have been a dumpster fire since I entered in February and am now down 30% across the board.  Thought I was being smart.
2021-05-06 17:11:53,wallstreetbets,Only think I took from this is you called yourself retarded
2021-05-06 17:30:14,wallstreetbets,Sounds like someone just learned a lot of lessons recently.  Good job 👏

2021-05-06 18:21:54,wallstreetbets,TL;DR but I’m sure it’s good advice.
2021-05-06 17:54:06,wallstreetbets,"Always Have a Bullish AND Bearish thesis, then play accordingly.

If you don't 'Believe' in T.A. / charts because you think it's voodoo and haven't realized it's about Human Psychology which allows you to leverage an Edge in your next position based on probabilities.  You are truly a degenerate gambling ape that's not only blind, but cant even read braile - but best of luck with your lottery tickets.

Trading, ESPECIALLY with leverage is a zero sum game. Investing with shares, the company-ticker itself has to go to ZERO before you're REKT AF"
2021-05-06 16:45:18,wallstreetbets,It’s only a loss if you sell
2021-05-06 16:59:00,wallstreetbets,Why was this allowed?

2021-05-06 17:41:34,wallstreetbets,This guy might actually be a retard. Where’s your stop loss on RKT buddy?
2021-05-06 16:41:55,wallstreetbets,"You are clueless.   Stop ""investing"""
2021-05-06 18:32:37,wallstreetbets,"This should be given to every new investor. lmao. Learned this the hard way. Started with memestocks and ended up trading Berkshire, waste management, mining, adidas, banks and oil companies. The riskiest thing I am doing is mining on my GPU when not used paying 1/10th market price in electricity and coming back to warm and comfy room.

Couldn't end further than I have started. Be careful with indexes tho. People are mindlessly pouring their paychecks in and noone ever knows when could the flow reverse. Probably won't but I am keeping a lot of money in non USD denominated bonds."
2021-05-06 17:32:09,wallstreetbets,"What makes retards true retards is that in wsb casino they seek high rewards, yet are absolute cowards when they hit high risks.

**If you are hoping that your portfolio goes up 400%, be prepared for a drawdown time of 2 or 4 or 10 months and 50% or more loss.** OP got out of MVIS with -30% loss and he only tolerated drawdown of a week or so. Look at MVIS historical price, the stock is expected to behave like that."
2021-05-06 17:01:31,wallstreetbets,I’ve never read that much. And I ain’t starting now
2021-05-06 16:55:53,wallstreetbets,Agreed. And fully aware I may not be giving the best advice. The things I listed were/are just very simply things I wish I read before opening a portfolio
2021-05-06 18:04:37,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you could be right. Just depends on the stock honestly, and fair point about if it was worth investing in, it is worth jumping in at a discount. For me, my finances, and my portfolio as it sits. Minimizing loss by having it at 16% is what works for me."
2021-05-06 16:54:14,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t sell when it rising to $43 because I did think it would continue to go higher. I also didn’t sell when it was dropping from there as I honestly thought it would settle around $30 but it didn’t. I continued to hold hoping earnings would drive it back up. But it didn’t. Like I said, I’m long in RKT so it isn’t a big deal. But if I would’ve taken my profits it just generally would’ve allowed me to further diversify"

2021-05-06 18:39:06,wallstreetbets,"Mentioning Bullish/Bearish thesis. People often get so anchored to their primary case they don't realize all the posibilities the chosen company could get squashed/thrive.

2021-05-06 16:49:23,wallstreetbets,"I keep reading this stupid advice here, that's how you hold the bag forever complaining the stock never moves. Take the loss, put it into something better and recover your money. Don't hold like an idiot forever."

2021-05-06 18:08:04,wallstreetbets,"as I initially invested in RKT simply to try and turn a profit, I did have it set at 16%. Upon further DD on them, I switched my goal for them to be a long play. So right now, I do not currently have a profit/loss set on it. Also I think I mention several times that I am in fact a retard......sooooooo......yeah."
2021-05-06 16:50:36,wallstreetbets,"Right on dude. It says in the post I’m a fucking dipshit, and at least I own that. So if you have something to critique then list it. If not, feel free to go back to licking windows."

2021-05-06 17:09:12,wallstreetbets,"Me being long on RKT just means that I’m going to keep investing in them as I believe in their business model. Was hoping for a giant spike after earnings. With that being said, you’re right I did not follow my own advice/things I’ve learned. In hindsight I should’ve taken my profit. But for me currently, whether they go up or down doesn’t matter all that much. I’ll be a bag holder with them for a while, even if they were to hit that 20% profit for me again I don’t believe I would sell."
2021-05-06 17:18:18,wallstreetbets,"Lost about 2gs on MVIS, and that taught me a lot. Like I said, fucking around in paper trading can be helpful. Literally just experimenting."

2021-05-06 17:54:39,wallstreetbets,Umm lately feeling the same. Seems like timing and luck is key to success. I don’t have wisdom of boomers who saw boom/bust of stock market. Everytime a meme rises/falls or remain is a learning opportunity to me. Made so many worst options play that make me feel so retarded. One time I bought OTM mastercard option with no OI and volume with wide bid/ask spread. I spent about 2k at ask on 1$  and immediately saw the value drop to 0.05$ per contract and lost 95%  money in 1 sec. shit happens. Still learning and hopefully make my loss back.

2021-05-06 16:51:18,wallstreetbets,You can absolutely post positions and this seems like some BS excuse. You shouldn't have posted this screenshot if you didn't have positions ready.

2021-05-06 18:21:28,wallstreetbets,I think you are basically doing a stock analysis conspiracy. No way that this is an implicit relation.

2021-05-06 19:27:35,wallstreetbets,I think BB needs a bit of Viagra.

2021-05-06 18:53:38,wallstreetbets,im 1500 contracts balls deep. this thing need to start moving
2021-05-06 17:56:48,wallstreetbets,Down to $1.90 average on my 10c leaps. Just averaged down today.  Pretty cheap. 20 bagger by EOY. To the moon!
2021-05-06 17:09:29,wallstreetbets,Wen moon? 🥲
2021-05-06 19:09:54,wallstreetbets,Say it with me... BAG HOLD ER
2021-05-06 19:23:04,wallstreetbets,Good luck. I dumped the stock after seeing all those contract announcements that never mentioned how much they were. Gave me flashbacks of penny stocks I followed and NOK a few years ago.
2021-05-06 19:39:59,wallstreetbets,"2022 if Ivy gains traction. This year looks to be a wash. ERs are pretty lame. Secondly those debentures were a shitty thing to do to investors. Third I don't think IP sale will have as much oomf as it would have if it had been done this past Q. (I held after ER thinking they would be close since they aren't collecting IP money, I was wrong.) Fourth chip shortage this year will hurt them. Lastly they are planning to have weak growth this year in all segments of the business, even ones not affected by the chip shortage. Will buy leaps if stock hits $5. As of now just holding a couple 100 shares and trying to decide if I'll sell them for now or just carry these bags for a year."
2021-05-06 17:10:08,wallstreetbets,You think this thing will hit 42 by January?
2021-05-06 17:37:42,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-05-06 18:37:21,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I dumped a chunk of my GME gains into BB. Was a bit optimistic about the bottom, so 11.70's my rough cost/share, but I'm optimistic about the long term potential so I'm not terribly stressed"
2021-05-06 17:25:45,wallstreetbets,Is chinese?
2021-05-06 17:16:18,wallstreetbets,January 2023...yeah. I have a few.
2021-05-06 17:17:57,wallstreetbets,2023s If it even gets close that's a 30 bagger for me.
2021-05-06 18:55:24,wallstreetbets,Yah I’m in the same boat. Never had enough in my account to make it worth dollar cost averaging. Became a habit and just bought 1000 shares at like 15. Dropped to 13 and bought 800 more and then it really dropped lol. Down like 20k almost but feel fine cause I’m not gonna need to access the money for a few years anyway.
2021-05-06 18:45:37,wallstreetbets,Hello wen moon
2021-05-06 18:32:08,wallstreetbets,"Hey i am also holding these bags, a-fucking-gain"
2021-05-06 17:14:59,wallstreetbets,Dead money for a while. Time to move on
2021-05-06 18:13:37,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣
2021-05-06 17:17:38,wallstreetbets,lol averaged down to 22 and sold a fuckton of covered calls. pretty much neutral on a solid underlying. can't complain.
2021-05-06 16:29:50,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t look too promising... I am happy if it rises from those ashes considering it being traded at low levels.
2021-05-06 16:31:21,wallstreetbets,lol just promoting some random dd on some random reddit ??? delete this now
2021-05-06 16:27:51,wallstreetbets,Greet post thanks for sharing
2021-05-06 19:35:29,wallstreetbets,Only tsunamis I've seen around here lately come from things that shall not be mentioned. Similar to Pepto.
2021-05-06 16:33:44,wallstreetbets,I’m holding UWMC but I know RKT growth is tied to UWMC. Lots of people are posting pessimistic post on RKT and I’m posting on why it’s a good long term hold with Goldman as my reference. This is not a DD
2021-05-06 16:22:21,wallstreetbets,Definitely hold as it will get to the value it should be at soon. Plus it pays dividends.
2021-05-06 16:28:35,wallstreetbets,Hold strong the move upwards is coming.
2021-05-06 19:11:24,wallstreetbets,"Sell covered calls at your break even and collect dividends and premium until then. Dude this is a gem. Massive cashflow, low payout, super undervalued. I added more today and will continue to add while the yield is above 5%"
2021-05-06 16:58:56,wallstreetbets,"Why do I keep buying every dip? 🙃 It will pay out eventually, right?"
2021-05-06 18:08:59,wallstreetbets,Yup. I'm losing in both UWMC and EBANG right now. But we'll come back strong. Hold tight. Things are looking good for both.
2021-05-06 16:20:06,wallstreetbets,Hold strong fellow ape. In the future this will work out IMO. Lol
2021-05-06 16:29:43,wallstreetbets,Down 13%??? Poor guy.
2021-05-06 16:26:06,wallstreetbets,Short sellers are winning in the short term across the board. Come August i think everything is going to the moon.

2021-05-06 17:21:49,wallstreetbets,"Lol trust me if you’re crying after a 14% loss 75% or even 50% will break your soul.  Don’t risk big money on options if you’re not okay with losing it all

Edit: oh it’s shares.  There’s no way it can go tits up"
2021-05-06 16:46:54,wallstreetbets,"I'm kind of regretting not averaging down when it was at $7.03 earlier. Still, it'll probably tank again in a few days."
2021-05-06 16:54:50,wallstreetbets,this can't go tits up
2021-05-06 17:04:16,wallstreetbets,That’s a classic cup and handle formation. Hold tight.
2021-05-06 17:12:57,wallstreetbets,Looks like my portfolio with SPCE
2021-05-06 18:27:25,wallstreetbets,This may not be popular here but sometimes stock don't make it back to your breakeven.  You need to forget the price you bought it and ask yourself if you would buy it today.  If you wouldn't buy it sell it and put it into something you feel good about.
2021-05-06 18:00:15,wallstreetbets,Your dividens must be over 1k... what are you crying about
2021-05-06 19:12:17,wallstreetbets,Can i sell covered calls for may 21 and do I still get the dividends or no?
2021-05-06 19:19:03,wallstreetbets,"This is the way, been offsetting my losses on UWMC by selling $10, $11 and $12 covered calls"
2021-05-06 19:12:40,wallstreetbets,Probably less since that’s $800 a quarter just in dividends
2021-05-06 16:35:11,wallstreetbets,Why August
2021-05-06 17:24:55,wallstreetbets,"OCGN was $5 like 2 weeks ago. It’s really sad, the people of this sub have transformed from retarded to delusional."

2021-05-06 19:14:42,wallstreetbets,"You own the stock until you get called away, so yes.

I think you’ll regret getting rid of this one man."
2021-05-06 16:43:00,wallstreetbets,"Because erybdy has been killin it in earnings they are just so worried about inflation. I believe this inflation is temporary. If you would like a detailed perspective check out meetkevins videos he can explain a lot better than I can. Watch both of these:

2021-05-06 19:15:38,wallstreetbets,Hopefully man how much should i sell covered calls $10? You think?
2021-05-06 19:17:57,wallstreetbets,"I had sold Jan 2022 $17c now these are not worth a lot, so it’s really up to you how soon you want to exit this position. I closed my calls at 66% up and I’m waiting for a run to sell calls again"
2021-05-06 19:23:09,wallstreetbets,Can you close them off before exp date? Like lets say i choose January 2022 and i want to close it off next month you know do you i loose anything for closing it off early like premium?
2021-05-06 19:30:34,wallstreetbets,"You have to buy a call to close your call you sold, could be cost more than you sold it for depending on what stock price does"
2021-05-06 19:36:34,wallstreetbets,When you sell a call your capping your gains for a premium. So if they go 10x you still have to sell for the agreed price or pay the difference in premiums to close
2021-05-06 17:08:40,wallstreetbets,I've watched nok long enough to know it like the 4 to 4.20$ range way too much
2021-05-06 16:18:20,wallstreetbets,The flaw in your analysis is that you assume Ericsson is valued properly. Maybe NOK is priced right and Ericsson is overpriced.

2021-05-06 18:28:56,wallstreetbets,nokia will continue to move up and down every day with about a quarter between high and low.
2021-05-06 18:44:41,wallstreetbets,Nokia doesn’t care so much about stock market mark my words tomorrow ( Friday) will be one of those days it will start going down
2021-05-06 16:24:07,wallstreetbets,Doesn't matter. A strategy that's short ERIC and long NOK follows from this.
2021-05-06 16:27:41,wallstreetbets, straw man argument

2021-05-06 16:16:24,wallstreetbets,So there’s hope?

Cash is king in a market like this, if you are completely hedged into the market then you're going to have a bad time until it recovers. Right now is the time to have cash waiting daily to make swing trades and take advantage of the cheap puts that are still out there.

Tesla puts for August/September are so incredibly cheap and the value has been increasing week to week since it has leveled off. When you see money going from calls to puts then you start to reverse the trend. This is a cult stock but it's not impervious to market corrections or even common sense. Trade with conviction, do your own DD but most importantly don't trade with emotions (you lose almost every time). You can always make money on the runup and the rundown, just need to know when to get rid of the pride and those 20-50% losses you accumulated on growth stocks the last 5 months."

THis highly shorted stock is at 52 week low and should be easily north of $15 within 4 weeks.

* Average ticket price/med popcorn/med Coke: $23
* Total theatres open: 545
* Total quarterly revenue: $148,300,000

This calculation excludes all other concession revenues; so the total number of people is probably lower.

It looks like it's starting to hit a major trendline on this descent and if it breaks down then we will start hitting support levels. A break below 645 and I'm going all in on puts.

Also looking at reentering DKNG and PENN at this value. Good earnings reports with multiple catalysts remaining throughout the year. Probably take on some decent leaps and sell puts dated closer to August/September timeframe once I snatch up some shares.

As always good luck!"

2021-05-06 17:30:44,wallstreetbets,Nothing but better than expected news. I think it could be rocky for a bit but I think we are going to rise from here. Ultimately how quickly it goes up will depend on how the overall market and tech sector does over the next couple months.
2021-05-06 17:44:55,wallstreetbets,"I am more aligned with your antithesis. 

There subscription service is directly competing with apple's new fitness app. Apple's fitness app becomes more sticky because it can be integrated seamlessly with there wearables and the apple ecosystem.

Norditrack and other fitness equipment companies are encroaching on Pelaton's market

I can't even hope they would add a feature for user-created content where they would tap into advertising and pivot in to social media, because you already  have youtube that is very established. 

Then the growth was dramatically fueled by the pandemic, I would like to see detailed forward guidance on subscription growth and will that growth be sustained. With gym's reopening and people starving for social interaction, it could make it tough for peloton.

I am not saying their software is not good, they do a great job, but at the end of the day, at least for the short term, I don't see a clear path. 

For me the treadmill recall is not that big, I want to see subscription growth and I want to see Peloton use that amassing user-data to create new services and revenue streams."

edit:  STOCKS ARE FUN AGAIN!  I'm gonna ignore that I lost more than I gained today to postpone my depression."
2021-05-06 16:37:46,wallstreetbets,I hold BLDP. Got 50% loss after the earnings. Enjoy PLUG earnings next week

Can't go wrong with both imo. Timing is tricky, yeah, they're both at ATH. Might just need to bite the bullet, open a small position and avg into it as time goes on."

2021-05-06 16:26:29,wallstreetbets,Will first probably hit 450
2021-05-06 16:39:49,wallstreetbets,"it had a massive move bro, they just reported the wrong numbers so it sold off before the accurate numbers came out"
2021-05-06 16:40:18,wallstreetbets,"It was an insane beat but that has meant nothing recently.  That said, I'm holding onto quite a few SQ calls too (240-6/18)so good luck to us both"

2021-05-06 19:02:26,wallstreetbets,Hahaha your flair
2021-05-06 16:45:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah might be the best way right now.

I loaded up in 2019 at both of their highs (at the time) and then Corona hit shortly after..so barring that I think we're in a good spot. Their financials have been stellar the last couple Qs if I'm remembering correctly too."
2021-05-06 18:43:17,wallstreetbets,Lol that’s impressive
2021-05-06 16:55:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I did that also in like 2018 and they dropped. I rly like TD because they’re well known in the US like RY is good too but TD probably wins by a few hairs at least. I guess they’ll continue up. You with Questrade or IBKR?
2021-05-06 18:43:56,wallstreetbets,I try my best king
2021-05-06 16:59:39,wallstreetbets,"I jokingly call TD the Starbucks of banks, they're everywhere and their ATMs as well. So I agree with you there. I don't think either is a wrong choice, so play to your preference for sure.

I was with CIBC but recently switched to IBKR and I **love** it. Cheap fees, great interface and phone app IMO. Their desktop plat is similar to thinkorswim (used to papertrade on it) so it was easy for me to figure it out."
2021-05-06 17:04:25,wallstreetbets,"I’m with quest but I’m about to make the move to IBKR. Didn’t look them up too much but I know it’s better. Bought so many dips in the tfsa today I got mad cuz it’s 5$ each trade. 

TD the Starbucks of banks is fkn true lmao. Plus the green theme."
2021-05-06 17:06:13,wallstreetbets,"Oh damn I think it's like 1.30 a trade (one way) for what I'm paying. And 1.50USD/month for real time options data (only).

CIBC was 6.95 on stock or options, like get fucked lol."

2021-05-06 16:29:25,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-06 16:06:27,wallstreetbets,"Hang in there. I mean even if somehow it turns out that there is very little short interest, it really does appear that retail owns the float and Gamestop is a bright future. There's a lot of upside potential even without the squeeze."
2021-05-06 17:11:14,wallstreetbets,"GameStop is lining up an amazing team to run the company and has a roadmap for transitioning to a majority e-commerce with reduced retail stores.  Ryan Cohen is a proven boss when it comes to running an e-commerce business and he's brought many people from Chewy and Amazon to help restructure the business model.  Add to that the fact that the company has paid their outstanding debts, has hundreds of millions in the bank, just announced a new distribution center in York PA, and new items (computer components, collectables, apparel, etc) are showing up on the website every week.  

Remember these facts and hold strong.  The only way to go tits up on this trade is to set a stop-loss or paper hands on a manufactured short attack to crash the price.  Hold tight, you're going to the moon - see you there fellow ape! 🚀"

2021-05-06 18:18:39,wallstreetbets,"Shit Im in your age bracket and I only have 45k.  Also only a fraction of that is in GME because my 401K is locked as is and thats half.

Still a XXX ape at least.  To Valhalla my brother."
2021-05-06 15:46:52,wallstreetbets,You supreme autist. I aspire to be this retarded. Much love fellow 🦍
2021-05-06 16:04:16,wallstreetbets,Retirement on the moon doesn’t sound too bad
2021-05-06 18:07:08,wallstreetbets,Worst that could happen is Ryan restructuring the company and share price rising to 1000$ organically. IMHO the downside is limited on the mid term run. Volatility can be severe though. Brace yourself. Not a financial advise. Just opinion
2021-05-06 17:10:34,wallstreetbets,You are going to be a rich man!
2021-05-06 17:05:17,wallstreetbets,"God dammit, I admire your courage and I completely understand the sentiment."
2021-05-06 15:59:21,wallstreetbets,Everything
2021-05-06 17:39:35,wallstreetbets,"I mean, 90k isn't that much for retirement so your doing a big brane move rn."
2021-05-06 18:36:55,wallstreetbets,Do you own a home?  Take out another mortgage and invest that too for true retard status.
2021-05-06 16:29:59,wallstreetbets,That’s the right kind of diversification ha
2021-05-06 17:54:28,wallstreetbets,How do you only have 90k at 38? That's the real question.

2021-05-06 17:40:01,wallstreetbets,"You think it's fairly valued at over $150/share? wut

They also have to compete with steam. Even if they're really successful, $150/share is extremely high."
2021-05-06 19:54:28,wallstreetbets,"I wish I had money to be a xx,xxx holder. But I honestly feel good about the whole thing. See you on the moon!"
2021-05-06 16:58:10,wallstreetbets,The way is this
2021-05-06 19:27:46,wallstreetbets,"A metric ton of crappy DD, like virtually every other meme stock here. This is going to trade sideways for the foreseeable future with the occasional bump on good news. OP should’ve yolo’d that into ETH, period. That will crack $10k within the decade, GME may not even see $400 again."
2021-05-06 16:17:13,wallstreetbets,Maybe. But it's not like I was going to retire on a yacht at this point anyway.
2021-05-06 18:44:57,wallstreetbets,"Who knows? Probably not for a while? If ever? Because while I have the utmost confidence in GME, it's technically still a speculation based on assumption.

Even if the assumptions are reasonable and we'll researched, they are none the less assumptions."
2021-05-06 15:58:30,wallstreetbets,Sluts and the open sea sounds alright by me
2021-05-06 15:51:54,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't that be some shit
2021-05-06 15:58:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah a tax specialist after this play moons

2021-05-06 18:10:12,wallstreetbets,You’re being downvoted but the dude only has 80k 25 years before retirement age.  That’s unfortunately not enough
2021-05-06 18:30:23,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much my thoughts, so I don't know why you're being down voted. Have an upvote from me!"
2021-05-06 19:20:11,wallstreetbets,"I’d call it big balls but not big brained.

GME is more likely to head back below $100 than to hit $400 again. Not saying this to be a dickhead just saying: sentiment aside there is a LOT that can go wrong with RC’s plans.

I would not touch this stock @ $159 with someone else’s money."
2021-05-06 18:46:32,wallstreetbets,"I don't unfortunately. I live in the SF Bay Area, which means if I could afford a house, I wouldn't need to YOLO lol."
2021-05-06 18:09:10,wallstreetbets,It’s like people forget the masses have been financially kneecapped on a semi regular basis at this point.
2021-05-06 18:19:38,wallstreetbets,It’s called poverty. We didn’t have GME when e we were kids.
2021-05-06 18:15:10,wallstreetbets,LOL most Americans live pay check to pay check
2021-05-06 18:31:55,wallstreetbets,lol because you can only accumulate so much wealth when you grew up in near poverty.
2021-05-06 18:28:03,wallstreetbets,Truer words have never been said.
2021-05-06 17:48:46,wallstreetbets,"I'd guess it's worth about $35/share at most, if they do really really good this year maybe $40"
2021-05-06 18:28:40,wallstreetbets,Is this the way?
2021-05-06 19:29:20,wallstreetbets,Account history checks out

2021-05-06 15:58:09,wallstreetbets,boomers need to be overthrown and their assets seized to pay off their debt.  then we can build a sustainable economy.

2021-05-06 18:47:57,wallstreetbets,Understood. I live in Vancouver BC. Same situation.
2021-05-06 18:29:47,wallstreetbets,I dont even add to any kind of retirement or social security. Im either rich before I retire or ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

2021-05-06 18:29:45,wallstreetbets,"Right, living the American dream."
2021-05-06 18:33:57,wallstreetbets,That is true.

2021-05-06 17:42:40,wallstreetbets,Beclown thyself no more
2021-05-06 17:41:18,wallstreetbets,Over a certain amount maybe.
2021-05-06 18:37:17,wallstreetbets,I do agree it is rough out there.
2021-05-06 18:30:36,wallstreetbets,I think most people financially kneecap themselves most of the time by making poor choices. Not saying that's you.
2021-05-06 18:47:29,wallstreetbets,(Inserts crayon in nose like Homer) Is the this way?
2021-05-06 18:35:53,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-06 18:41:28,wallstreetbets,"I mean I’m sure that plays into it with a lot of people, but like - that’s the age when you’re stuck paying off your own school loans if you were lucky enough to go, trying to raise children and pay for their schooling, and this is when your parents start needing help.  It’s really, *really* easy to get stretched too thin.  Add in stagnant wages, ever climbing housing costs, and healthcare is criminally expensive - when the shit do a lot of people have time to save up more than that by 40?

And let’s pour one out for our homies that did everything right, and still got wiped out because the stock market is rigged.

We can preach bootstraps all we want but there is a systematic problem going on.

Edit:  we also had a lot of people lose absolutely everything because of COVID.  Blood sweat and tears went into businesses that got ruined.  There are so many damn reasons to be broke right now, it boggles me how there’s almost no sympathy."
2021-05-06 18:36:45,wallstreetbets,Ouch.
2021-05-06 18:45:08,wallstreetbets,People need to pick a major that has income potential to pay back their student loans. Spending 200k on a degree that only make you 40k a year is just stupid. Of course it would be okay if dad can afford it. I just don't believe parents should kill themselves to pay for college.

2021-05-06 18:26:41,wallstreetbets,"u/JakTravis_u_SOB

This is hilarious and painful at the same time. The difference is I'm still holding on to my AMC shares. I will not share AMC to buy other stocks. I'm going to keep holding on to AMC until those dumb hedge funds buy back the millions of shares they shorted and they still have not bought any shares back. I know eventually, those hedge funds have to buy back the shares as the interest continues to go up. Diamond hands all the way"
2021-05-06 18:33:57,wallstreetbets,Had to buy some more AMC to recover from being exposed like this
2021-05-06 17:17:33,wallstreetbets,"This made me laugh so hard at the DMV, that everyone stared at me.  This is funny because thats how I felt after buying GME @250 and then watching it drop..

2021-05-06 19:10:16,wallstreetbets,I feel like the reference to market cap in relation to a squeeze is irrelevant. Look at GME Market cap 1 year ago vs today.
2021-05-06 19:13:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, with a 4x higher float and the lement of surprise. Lol"
2021-05-06 19:47:18,wallstreetbets,"Gme short interest was >140% of the float and insanely undervalued.  Neither of those things are true of amc. There is zero possibility of a short squeeze, just hype from a bunch of retards."
2021-05-06 19:54:20,wallstreetbets,You guys are really still on this “squeeze” thing huh? Ok then
2021-05-06 19:14:50,wallstreetbets,"I’m not negating the fact that GME was/is a great play, just acknowledging that AMC has a huge upside as well as do many other extremely shorted stocks"
2021-05-06 19:58:36,wallstreetbets,"AMC does not have huge upsides right now. Before they pandemic started they were in decline at their lowest value in 5 years. As of today they have added over a year of operating debt AND they diluted their shares. It's not like GME where they are going to be growing their company into something bigger. 

There's going to be a significant dip in their stock in the next 6-12 months."
2021-05-06 16:56:59,wallstreetbets,"GDRX has positive low earnings, Downward trending. Not sure if this is a play worth doing, but I will say there are cheap contracts for high risk.

2021-05-06 16:24:27,wallstreetbets,Corsair fucked me
2021-05-06 19:44:44,wallstreetbets,Who still believes stock price is connected to what the company is doing? It's ALL manipulation. ALL. OF. IT. The big money would love for you to believe that a good earnings report or anything a company does will support your investment. Ever see a stock tank the day of/day after a great earnings report? Yeah they floated some ultra low priced shares and paperhands took the bait - suddenly the price tanks and they took your money. The stock is connected to the company in name only. Come on guys - this is allllllll psychological and a game of chicken. The house controls who wins and how much. Follow the money.
2021-05-06 15:42:54,wallstreetbets,"Look, just because a stock is ""undervalued"", it doesn't mean its being manipulated. You do basic analysis, and the stock is ""undervalued"" compared to the market yes. But its about fairly valued. Also shorting can bring a stock down, but it doesn't manipulate it necessarily.

The gaming market is highly cyclical and given the reopening of the economy, less people are going to be sitting around playing games. I mean look at $HEAR. You can see almost the tops and bottoms over a long chart. I think CRSR is a great company and are way more diverse. But to say that it is undervalued because it's got a forward P/E of 12 is wrong. The company could be peaking right now and earnings are all down hill for the next few years.

2020 was the gaming year. 2021 is going to see tailwinds coming from that, but not extreme growth. I do like them, and they have awesome brands within their company portfolio. I am considering adding them to my portfolio. But there are still some things that could make companies ""undervalued"". RKT has a forward P/E ratio of 11, but everyone knows from here on out the mortgage market won't be as hot. They could be wrong though. I could be wrong.

It just reminds me of back in 2017-2018 when I bought MU, cause their P/E ratio was 4.

4!

Then they kept going downhill from 48 to low 30s because everyone knew that the dram industry would be cooling off. And they were right. Looking back I should've held. So long run, CRSR will be great as the gaming industry grows overall. But COVID pulled that forward a few years."
2021-05-06 15:50:14,wallstreetbets,"I always liked it, on paper when you look at it logically it should be in the upper $40's as a normal resistance level and keep floating up from there based on what that company is to date. But this is not a normal market , its a blood bath on most days and DD and charts and levels dont even matter most of the time now"
2021-05-06 16:05:36,wallstreetbets,"I feel ya man. It was tough seeing it hit $36 and just lose all of its momentum. The basic assumption that people are just going to stop playing video games just doesn't make sense to me. My thought process is in fact the opposite: the pandemic brought in a whole new batch of gamers who are here to stay. Its very funny, I really am getting similar vibes to GME back in December. I would sit around all day trying to figure out why the price was still in the teens with so many reasons it should be higher so I suppose I'll just sit back and wait ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
2021-05-06 15:47:23,wallstreetbets,"A lot of things happen in the market as far as momentum. I just checked it out and it’s a good solid company with growth and while they do have a lot of debt it’s not bad and everyone’s definition of a lot is relative. It’s definitely a long term buy and I think a good investment at these levels.   Be patient, this will likely scream when the new video games release in the fall and with Xmas gifts on people’s minds it will likely be talked about a lot more and get a momentum trade 

That’s my 2 cents"
2021-05-06 18:04:42,wallstreetbets,"I hold bags in CRSR. Conspiracy theories aside there are more plausible reasons why the stock is not performing:

\- Supply > demand: Since the lock up period expired insiders are free to sell. Seems like they finally do. I believe this is the main culprit.

\- Reopening leads people to believe that consumers will rather spend their money on cocktails, putas and cocaina in the foreseable future rather than their basement gaming set up, which in their eyes justifies a low P/E due to lower growth prospects.

\- Cyclicals being more attractive at the moment.

Not my beliefs. But the market seems to see it that way."
2021-05-06 16:11:31,wallstreetbets,"Why does everyone bitch about manipulation and complain that a company is undervalued.  As an investor,  you should welcome a company that is undervalued.  That's what makes it a buy. If you really feel it's undervalued,  you should be buying and buying more. Just because you bought doesn't mean tomorrow it will come to the value that you see.  Sometimes that takes years.  It's the proverbial short term voting machine long term weighing machine."
2021-05-06 16:10:33,wallstreetbets,"Maybe the question should be, why is the rest so HORRIBLY overvalued?

Do you think p/e ratio of 39 is normal? or healthy? You're saying it's ok for the company to take 39 YEARS before it earns your money back ? How many companies even make it to 39 years...

This market is fucking stupid. It's complete hype and speculation."
2021-05-06 16:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Everyone is up Bc the pandemic  and work from home. Corsair isn’t up as much as it should be. 

Bad management team. 

Bad operations. 


Just bad everywhere. Easies put play two ERs in a row."
2021-05-06 15:36:41,wallstreetbets,Mhmm..... 🥱🧐🤔😳🤥🤐
2021-05-06 15:46:31,wallstreetbets,Same with New York Mortgage Trust (NYMT) I think. Total manipulation. Average 2M volume/day but there’s consistently 20-30k buy and sell orders at every .01 interval.
2021-05-06 18:04:08,wallstreetbets,I dont understand the short position on Corsair. They have a solid product line and have had strong revenue growth. I agree. I think some hedge fund wants to see this company fail.
2021-05-06 15:35:54,wallstreetbets,Because if someone wants to buy now there’s other gaming stocks that have dipped much further. Unity is down 50% from its peak and roblox is now below its ipo price.
2021-05-06 16:00:27,wallstreetbets,"Because your entire DD is 'expected earnings' and 'forward P/E'. That's called speculation. Smart money buys what is and not what may be. Especially with the imminent burst and following bear market.

Current P/E is 28.86, fundamentally high. Current EPS is $1.13, fundamentally low. If you're looking at a long term value investment, you wouldn't even be looking past that. At 28.86, it's already overvalued. Not in this market, surely, but in general."
2021-05-06 17:06:52,wallstreetbets,everything is priced in

2021-05-06 15:33:35,wallstreetbets,"I did accumulate more shares today, but I do not want to buy on margin... 🥶"
2021-05-06 18:02:23,wallstreetbets,Same lol
2021-05-06 16:06:00,wallstreetbets,"Valid points. I just posted a few metrics here, I personally love to look at p/e and revenue growth (and sustainability of this growth). I also have Turtle Beach stock, even though in way lower amounts. Turtle Beach has a much better balance sheet, but I like their products less and they are more cyclical. They are more reliant on console releases for their main product, the headsets. Have to admit, I love their Roccat acquisition! 
The MU example is a great example imo! I will continue to hold. Even though 2020 was a catalyst for growth, let's be honest everyone knows in the coming years, there will be more (PC) gamers every year, and not to forget streamers. 

I will continue to hold and next big accumulation point is under 30."
2021-05-06 18:31:27,wallstreetbets,"Lol that’s not how it works bud, unless the company never grows again"
2021-05-06 15:38:37,wallstreetbets,"Looking at valuation, Corsair is valued way better IMO (purely numbers based)."
2021-05-06 16:45:20,wallstreetbets,Unity doesn't make hardware. Neither does Roblox.
2021-05-06 16:18:28,wallstreetbets,"Curious where you're getting your numbers from. The various websites have been a bit wacky but they reported EPS of .3, .54, and .53 for Q2, Q3, and Q4 of last year which gives it at least a 1.37 EPS for 2020. If we're looking at TTM, their EPS is currently at 1.95 (add the .58 for the most recent earnings). However, this company isn't trading on these current multiples. It's trading on worries of the chip shortage and the notion that gaming demand will fall dramatically post-pandemic. You can either believe it will or it won't, but regardless this stock's low float/volume does mean 1-2 big sellers can dramatically stop momentum."
2021-05-06 16:24:43,wallstreetbets,"They literly stated that their earnings this year are expected to be (at highest) 255 million usd. 3/0.25 = 12. 
Smart money buys what may be and not what is."
2021-05-06 15:38:15,wallstreetbets,35 calls will be fine and you should be able to sell the 45 calls after a nice rally. Don’t worry about this chop. It’s just reallocation. Tech has done so well that asset managers are too heavily invested in tech and are doing some rotating. It will stabilize soon.
2021-05-06 18:07:52,wallstreetbets,Never use margin!
2021-05-06 16:44:07,wallstreetbets,"I invested in crsr calls just before earnings - beat expectations handily, stock still fell.

2021-05-06 15:37:13,wallstreetbets,Easy to obtain loans drive up college prices. Plus the colleges will compete with each other on their additional services which cost money and drive up cost further.
2021-05-06 17:24:49,wallstreetbets,"Remember that the colleges know exactly how much every student and their parents make, they know how much the government will give them, then they teach their students to trust Authority and they don't teach them how to think, which creates adults who blindly trust the system, and can't examine the problem.  This is why they are crying in the streets about loan forgiveness, but nobody talks about reforming the schools or getting the government out of the system (everything government touches gets exponentially more expensive, education and Healthcare  are the prime examples. Private industry actually has tons of free education online)."

If this is your thesis you sell tech to buy it back cheaper towards the end of the economic cycle when tech will start outperforming in relative terms as we enter the economic downturn. This is the rotation that smart money has been undergoing for a couple of weeks. And it shows in relative performance."

Bought stocks that have performed well, crushed earnings, yet still plummeted. Bought some lesser known stocks, some of which have performed “ok”, but nowhere near the relief to keep my portfolio balanced. 
Bought slow, bought diverse. This all feels very... corrupt.

Giving people the freedom to ""jump out"" would be dangerous. You are hanging under a parachute, you don't have one yourself. Jumping out in a normal situation would kill you (or atleast frick you up). In the situation in the video there are a few options (I think), 1 the guy in the boat goes faster and lift the girls out with the parachute (most likely the plan didn't work), 2 the guy in the boat slows down and the girls float up (most likely didn't do that). In most shitty situations the boat should stop, in the water? Float up because life vests. Floating above the water? Fall down with the parachute. Both a lot better than someone jumping out, that also gives you the chance of getting lost in the middle of an open water."

If I had made bigger bets then I would be sitting on thousands, not hundreds. Started betting big and lost everything I came to play with. After 8 hours I walked away from the table with zero bucks. Felt dirty, and never played again. I mostly am in this group for the jokes and maybe getting a good pick here and there, I only go long my positions and it's worked well. Best wishes!"

2021-05-06 14:45:43,wallstreetbets,At least list the positions you unloaded so we know what to buy to ride it back up.
2021-05-06 14:45:52,wallstreetbets,All the stocks that are moving our the normal stocks like Home Depot or waste management or crocs. All the meme stocks that are mentioned here are tanking.

2021-05-06 15:05:51,wallstreetbets,"Everyone wins and loses. The harder you make these gainz the harder you fall. Buts it about getting back up, and doing it all over again. But smarter. Idk what smarter is 🤷."

2021-05-06 14:32:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you, my largest holding is Roku, and it's sank $200k since March."
2021-05-06 16:32:07,wallstreetbets,"I feel that. I have no clue where tf past trading me went. Up 150% from -50% back to -50% now on my account.

At least I used some gains to go on vacation. Plus, we, assuming, are young and can learn from it. Turn that shit around"

2021-05-06 18:32:57,wallstreetbets,Yeah Jesus Christ. Here is some investing advice: if you’re tired of seeing red crayons stop using a font written in red crayons.

2021-05-06 17:26:24,wallstreetbets,Nowhere. Literally nobody that has that data gives it out for free. Welcome to the real problem with market structure and not this Mickey Mouse GME bullshit.
2021-05-06 14:14:04,wallstreetbets,WSB is not what it used to be.... it was an amazing place to find info now it’s just bloated to shit all about GME it’s pretty sad... joined this sub at 400k

2021-05-06 15:22:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm still in need to learn good stuff
2021-05-06 17:29:39,wallstreetbets,"Good post u/TacticalTrader44

Yellen yesterday says rates my have to rise to prevent overheating.

Fed today ""warns"" of significant declines in asset prices.  

That correction is a-knockin' at the door delivering a pizza with inflation and new tax toppings."
2021-05-06 18:49:37,wallstreetbets,I'm seriously disappointed by the quality and actual shitposts now . It's definitely quieter on bullshit on days like today where folks lose a shit ton of money  but doubt that this is to stay.
2021-05-06 14:17:24,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I’m seeing a shift and just wanted to bring that up without getting overly technical.
2021-05-06 14:19:03,wallstreetbets,You’re absolutely correct! What I’m saying is there is a time for that. In our economy I do not think it is a good idea. It is time to preserve your assets.
2021-05-06 14:35:34,wallstreetbets,"I believe, without talking about it, inflation is hitting. I believe in the next 4 years it’s going to be a serious issue. Not a huge deal if you have a decent job and manage wealth properly but people on here do not do that. They will be the victims."
2021-05-06 15:20:25,wallstreetbets,Good job! Not a bad move to have some cash on stand by and gold.
2021-05-06 15:30:42,wallstreetbets,Keep studying! Takes time.
2021-05-06 17:37:35,wallstreetbets,You’re right about that lol. The big question is... when?!
2021-05-06 15:01:42,wallstreetbets,"Ya that's very fair.  Tbh I think there's good arguments for and against high risk right now.  But if you're young, honestly just fuck it and go for it, losing money in your early 20s really doesn't matter that much and honestly is probably just some expensive lessons.  But I wouldn't yolo my student loans or any loans for that matter lol.  But on the other hand, I wouldn't knock someone for taking a safe approach now, keeping a decently large cash position and maybe some liquid stores of value like PM's"
2021-05-06 15:58:56,wallstreetbets,"Thx Bro! I have to fight with money managment - great start, perfect race but fuck me... Always same mistake and no knowledge when to get out from train"
2021-05-06 15:14:13,wallstreetbets,I can agree with that. I personally do not trade overly “safe”. But I’m also not putting my account into weekly yolo calls. I think this market is about to get really weird.
2021-05-06 17:11:19,wallstreetbets,I would highly suggest studying a couple candle chart books and learn how option IV works.
2021-05-06 17:11:33,wallstreetbets,You’ll get there thoughn

2021-05-06 15:50:04,wallstreetbets,"I have been, I'm tired of them expiring worthless.  I may buy more calls, but probably just keep loading up on shares.  I like the stock.  I'm not really looking to sell.  These e-commerce companies are just spectacular long term investments.  The gaming industry is gonna be a monster in the near future."
2021-05-06 15:58:40,wallstreetbets,"What, and potentially give away my part of the best e-commerce company & dream team management ever assembled.  I don't want to miss being apart of this historic company's saga."
2021-05-06 16:07:33,wallstreetbets,I initiated a transfer to fidelity Monday and the transfer got done Wed. You won't miss the squeeze dude.
2021-05-06 17:36:31,wallstreetbets,"You should do it before, RH is not trustworthy at all ! Vanguard is very professional."
2021-05-06 17:53:24,wallstreetbets,This guy actually believes robinhood will let him sell during the mooning
2021-05-06 17:37:06,wallstreetbets,How many times have tickets been magically halted? Even going as far as restrictions on SELLING.
2021-05-06 18:58:03,wallstreetbets,"Dude you have time, everything takes time for it to happen if you initiate a transfer to fidelity or vanguard now it will be in your account next week.  Increasing the fundamental quality of GameStop increases the value - don’t plan for a moon plan for increasing value.

If it’s in Robinhood quite frankly you can’t keep track of your shares (or at the most you’re uncertain right?). Plus Robinhood by all accounts is a nefarious company.

Do yourself the favor of getting with the big dawgs. Trust me you have time."
2021-05-06 16:38:17,wallstreetbets,"I was just joking.  I was reversing what everyone usually screams ""buy shares, not calls"".   Obviously not one person got it."
2021-05-06 18:42:55,wallstreetbets,You guys are so funny “I like the stock”. What in the hell makes you think nostalgic youth is worth $160 a pop.
2021-05-06 18:17:45,wallstreetbets,Sell weekly FDs on just half your shares.  Set a strike you’d be happy with and  buy more GME with your call tendies
2021-05-06 19:18:41,wallstreetbets,👆 there is still time
2021-05-06 19:28:58,wallstreetbets,Actually I've decided I will transfer those 30 shares because I'm not looking to sell anytime soon anyway.
2021-05-06 19:35:33,wallstreetbets,I don't know man I just keep buying and holding.  I'm just a simple ape. Don't try to confuse me.
2021-05-06 19:02:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm probably going to do it. I already have TD Ameritrade just don't want to miss out on anything.

Once other look at it the stock will shoot by itself it not like the issue we have with GME, AMC, NOK, PSLV where price is shorted to change the way…. VIAC will hi about 36 and then pop up dramatically"

2021-05-06 14:33:14,wallstreetbets,Some people you can tell just don’t care about their money and just want to hop on the hype trains. Not saying I wouldn’t get in on $VIAC though because it is Half decent but I will do more research
2021-05-06 15:59:55,wallstreetbets,Lol ur on your own
2021-05-06 18:36:52,wallstreetbets,He's right. $VIAC is the next $GME. Heavily shorted and deeply undervalued. It will take an army of apes who believe in the value of the company to scare away the shorts.
2021-05-06 14:10:39,wallstreetbets,I’m right behind you!
2021-05-06 15:09:40,wallstreetbets,VIAC is a strong buy in the 30s

2021-05-06 17:50:51,wallstreetbets,I think he is being sarcastic.
2021-05-06 16:03:55,wallstreetbets,It can be any number. It was only 11 last year

2021-05-06 14:46:52,wallstreetbets,37.80 right now…. It keeps testing but I bet the shorts will try harder to get it down a bit but price discovery is going to kick in soon and it will go right back up
2021-05-06 18:07:58,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. 

This is the dumbest shit ive ever read."
2021-05-06 18:08:33,wallstreetbets,It's true
2021-05-06 14:41:58,wallstreetbets,"Wish is and pushes garbage, no thanks"
2021-05-06 16:26:17,wallstreetbets,Lol nobody tell him
2021-05-06 15:44:18,wallstreetbets,"Wish is pure fraud, and their stock has performed worse than RKT on most timescales, even if you take into account that earnings fiasco. Good luck, but I'd be shocked if wish didn't hit 0 before it goes back to IPO."
2021-05-06 15:48:25,wallstreetbets,"How is it fraud? What do you mean by ""go back to IPO""?"
2021-05-06 16:22:06,wallstreetbets,"They are very unprofitable, they provide a bad service, and have the worst PR in their market. They don't protect themselves or their customers against literal fraud from shitty sellers on their marketplace. And they won't get back to the price they IPOed at. Their SP would have to nearly double right now. I don't see that happening ever with a company leaning on such a shitty product."
2021-05-06 13:53:33,wallstreetbets,Not sure why they have taken such a dip today but if you do think it is undervalued today seems like a good day to get in.
2021-05-06 14:01:05,wallstreetbets,I’d say buy and hold stock. You can try earnings or get in after earnings. It’s supposed to be on the Russell index in June. It should rise. There have been estimates of 11-12 dollars per share and crazy fools saying 15 per share. I think it’s a fine hold. I just hope you aren’t holding at $13 per share.
2021-05-06 14:38:17,wallstreetbets,"I’m holding till after earnings, or beyond. Looking for $11 as a realistic price point. Think they’ll blow expected 21Q1 out of the water and the stock price will reflect that. It’s a great day to buy on sale. 

$/s: Currently in @ $7.63 for 92 shares."
2021-05-06 13:47:23,wallstreetbets,It is and pays a dividend
2021-05-06 14:51:47,wallstreetbets,Amazing buy in price and will gain in value this year. Possibilities to jump up right away short term with Russel preliminary rankings announced 5/7 and if their earnings beat the expectations which they should as they handle more purchases than others on their wholesale side. Also most analysts rate at $11 so plenty of room to grow and Dividends.
2021-05-06 13:56:40,wallstreetbets,"There's no way it's worth $100 right now. Based on PE of other mortgage stocks, you'd expect it to be right around where Rocket is now. From what I've seen so far, the CEO seems to be pretty active about doing things to drive long term value, rather than just pop the stock price in the short term. Volume has been crazy low the last month or so but today the selling pressure is just too high after RKT imploded. Their earnings call on Monday should knock it out of the park, but the entire earnings season for almost every stock has been so laissez-faire that I'm not hopeful for a reversal this quarter. The dividend yield is pretty darn spicy, though. All in all, it's a good buy and hold stock, which makes it wildly unsexy for WSB."
2021-05-06 15:29:12,wallstreetbets,Great post just got in pretty cheap for some 1/22 calls
2021-05-06 13:47:39,wallstreetbets,"I used to be bullish on this one, but every call I’ve placed for the past 3 months has expired worthless. Try puts"
2021-05-06 16:45:38,wallstreetbets,"According to Marketwatch, 6 analysts all mark it as a BUY."
2021-05-06 17:17:44,wallstreetbets,"Look... as whole, uwmc is a highly profitable company in a sector that has seen huge growth recently. Although the stock reacted today as if they were the ones that missed earnings and not rkt. The majority of today's movement was due in large majority to short sellers. The actual turnover rate for this stock is fairly low at the moment. It does move with fairly minimal volume... in both directions due to the relatively low float. 

But.... the issue is mostly volume, there isn't enough volume on the buy side to combat the short sellers. And today, there was just enough powder from buyers to hold the line above 7. 1 day with a large increase to buy volume would cause a pretty decent upwards swing. And on top of that, it really needs to be market buys, not limit buys to really push it and get momentum."
2021-05-06 13:50:02,wallstreetbets,To the moon....
2021-05-06 14:32:29,wallstreetbets,"$100/sh?

Nah, at least $1,000/sh, if not $100,000/sh"
2021-05-06 17:29:54,wallstreetbets,Based on EPS UWMC needs to be at $12.50 or RKT at $14 to be equivalent.  So either buy puts on RKT or calls on UWMC.

2021-05-06 16:28:01,wallstreetbets,Man and to think I got in when people's DD saying $30 a share was possible by July *dies laughing*
2021-05-06 16:08:08,wallstreetbets,"No... I have it at $8/share, but I’m debating buying another 500 shares at close today, especially if it stays where it is... it’s going to be on the Russell. No doubt... I’ll hold it as long as it takes.. it’s so undervalued it’s not funny."
2021-05-06 16:17:16,wallstreetbets,It’s nice to get some feedback. I spent some time researching this one... after making a bunch of stupid mistake last month.
2021-05-06 14:31:57,wallstreetbets,Is this always a quarterly .$10 dividend or just random? How’s this work because I’m seeing 5.6% return on dividend alone at this price right...
2021-05-06 17:08:53,wallstreetbets,"Russell prelims won't be announced to the public until June. Matt will know tomorrow, we won't unless he tweets about it."
2021-05-06 16:16:02,wallstreetbets,"I’d love $11/share... and while I wouldn’t buy into the size position I have now at $11, but I’d think about adding once it got there... , this should be higher than if not right at where RKT was in March @ $40/share eventually... no? 

I’m going to add 500/shares right now... I have a small position currently... ( see above ) but adding here is the right thing to do, I believe.."
2021-05-06 14:43:46,wallstreetbets,Difference here is UWMC is at all time low. How can you go lower (and record another all time low) after smashing earnings?
2021-05-06 17:20:03,wallstreetbets,"So in short, unless a lot of upward pressure is created from buyers, shorts are gonna be able to hold this down for awhile still."
2021-05-06 16:19:12,wallstreetbets,Why stop there?
2021-05-06 16:05:40,wallstreetbets,It was the Rkt news as they missed expectations by $0.01 and portions of their business may be suffering next quarter. UWMC has a different focus and revenue stream as top wholesaler.
2021-05-06 14:41:03,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-06 16:47:01,wallstreetbets,No dividend is guaranteed.
2021-05-06 17:16:01,wallstreetbets,Preliminary rankings are announced tomorrow though
2021-05-06 14:49:07,wallstreetbets,"UWMC: hold my beer

(I'm not bearish on UWMC, i'm just a salty $RKT bagholder)"
2021-05-06 16:15:44,wallstreetbets,🤡
2021-05-06 16:24:53,wallstreetbets,"Hope so 🙏

This stock could double if its on the preliminary Russell list tomorrow and report good earnings next week after the beat down today."
2021-05-06 16:01:20,wallstreetbets,"Stock is undervalued.. the dividend is a cherry on top. The price per share based on earnings, price per share x amount of shares dispersed should be wayyyy higher than what it is... point being is this stock will eventually take off.. my point is we should say when it does and buy the hell out of it."
2021-05-06 17:59:27,wallstreetbets,"Again... no they aren't.  Matt... as in the CEO of UWM will know tomorrow... but the prelims won't be released until next month to the public...fyi, that's us... idk who keeps spewing this BS... but even a quick Google search will tell you that your wrong."
2021-05-06 14:56:06,wallstreetbets,"At this point, I'd chuck it up to lower price = higher div. yield (currently at 5.7%). Buy more!"
2021-05-06 16:09:26,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-05-06 18:01:58,wallstreetbets,I was referring to what is stated on russell website in terms of rankings May 7th
2021-05-06 18:04:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, rankings are may 7th. Public release of those rankings are in June. It's not gonna do a thing for the stock."
2021-05-06 18:06:25,wallstreetbets,"I hear you, but everyone loves a leak. Buy on the rumor, sell on the news."
2021-05-06 18:14:40,wallstreetbets,"And I get that, but here's the deal, if Matt tweets something about it, then there's a rumor.. until then, it's just speculation... there's a difference."
2021-05-06 13:50:49,wallstreetbets,Y sell a $1k stock

2021-05-06 14:58:04,wallstreetbets,"Only tuned in in the last hour or so but I have to say thus far:

Gensler seems like vaguely or idealistically he's for protecting retail investors but as soon as someone gets into specifics he just get's vague and talks about what will ""have to be done"". 

Gensler talking about PfOF and the conflicts of interest being something they have to ""look into"" and how to really get ""best execution"" rather than acknowledging the blatant brokenness or inherent system flaws. Seems like there's either malicious resistance or just stupidity /inability to actually address the problems. 

Even his last question about fines was:

Fear and favor for firms and individuals - that's great but what does it look like? Are you going to be able to do that? You're alluding to higher fines and more penalties but that's all you're doing.

2021-05-06 16:16:52,wallstreetbets,"At best they’re clueless, in reality they know exactly what they’re doing and they’re complicit in screwing us all. They serve themselves, their lobbyists, and their campaigns. 

One side wants more regulation and/or fees that will actually hurt retail investors more. 

The other side wants to repeal anything that gets in the way of Wall Street fleecing everyone. They’ll eventually “give in” and make concessions once WallStreet tells them which regulations are best for WS. 

I think the best solution would be government minding their own business. “Regulation” allowed RH to screw everyone under the guise of “we’re just following the rules”. This shit doesn’t work when they’re the ones making the rules and they’ll always be the ones making the rules. Our politicians aren’t smart enough to make the rules, and anyone that is smart enough already works for WallStreet. New rules and regulation will only serve as another barrier to entry. There’s no way to “level the playing field” without over-regulating everything to a standstill. 

There’s also unlimited resources on the side of skirting the rules and pushing boundaries. The market moves at warp speed while government barely functions. 

Anyone that thinks more regulations will fix this has no clue how the market actually works."

2021-05-06 17:29:53,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you are American and, like many other Americans, think this way and promote this kind of pessimism about regulation, as well as promoting the myth of a “free market” is both a symptom and a cause of our country having substantially fewer protections in place against market workings being abused by the wealthy and powerful. Sure, not all regulation is effective or well-intentioned, but if proportionately more people educated themselves about precisely what sort of regulation would help, and applied sustained pressure to the political system for financial reform we would be better off.

Should we, for example, do away with regulations against insider trading and reporting requirements for members of congress and corporate insiders to disclose their buys and sells? It would make the market so much more FREE, though!"

2021-05-06 16:30:47,wallstreetbets,"What about instant settlements? Or lowering it to T+1? Or however fast we can make it? One of the major areas for fuckery occurs when they’re settling things, dicking around in dark pools, and doing other BS in the name of “liquidity”. 

We’re leaving the door to the bank vault wide open and expecting the bank robbers to keep each other in line."
2021-05-06 17:44:19,wallstreetbets,"You cited examples of what is essentially fraud; fraud would never be ok. Everything that happened recently happened because there was regulation in place that allowed it to happen.

The hedge funds were asking for more regulation during the first hearing. Why? Because they’re trying to protect us from ourselves? I believe it’s because they know they’ll figure out a way around it and it’ll eventually be used as either a barrier to entry, or just a simple advantage that they can take further advantage of due to their limitless resources. 

You think the regulation helps us protect ourselves from the wealthy and powerful. I think the wealthy and powerful are creating the regulations to protect themselves and give us a false sense of security. We would have to regulate WallStreet to the point where the market wouldn’t function if we were to regulate Wallstreet if we wanted protection from the wealthy. Or do you think we’re only a few more decades away from having it under control? It’s been this way since the invention of fractional reserve banking!

Look at the tax code. How much regulation is in place through the tax code? Why do the wealthy itemize their taxes while 90% of households take standard deductions? They whine and bitch when we try to raise rates, but they’re ultimately not afraid, there’s a huge system in place to keep them in place."
2021-05-06 18:05:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m open to your feedback, but what specifically is stupid? All of the events that occurred did so despite the presences of tons of regulations. There are already regulations against naked shorting. RH halted purchases due to regulatory requirements. How many more regulations do you want? That’s my point, no matter how many rules you set, they’re going to figure out an advantage. Not only are they going to figure out an advantage, they’re probably going to work it into the regulations themselves. Did you listen to the hearings? Did it sound like many of the politicians were familiar enough with the nuances of markets/regulations to form an opinion on their own?

“Naked shorting” as it currently exists, is done under the guise to meet liquidity requirements set by regulators. If we moved to instant settlements or lessened the settlement window there wouldn’t be a need for naked shorting. I don’t think you should be allowed to sell something you don’t possess, and the market would should be able to solve that all on its own. Instead we let MMs hide behind regulations. 

They’re able to justify naked shorting because “they’re just following the rules”. Same thing with dark pools and all the other bullshit they pull in order to meet liquidity requirements and allow the markets to function smoothly. 

We should start eliminating the things that provide an advantage that’s not otherwise publicly available. Having more money and better resources are not unobtainable advantages, but having insider information, or the backing of biased regulatory enforcement are examples unjust advantages."
2021-05-06 16:27:45,wallstreetbets,Is there any argument against instant settlements? (Other than the amount of computing power required). I think instant settlements (or as close as possible) would fix so many issues. I doubt it’ll ever happen because it’ll screw WallStreet. I’d actually be ok with paid orderflow if we had as close to instant settlements as possible.

2021-05-06 17:43:27,wallstreetbets,how so?
2021-05-06 17:58:22,wallstreetbets,"I can agree with some of that, but to avoid responding at great length... 

Fraud is fraud if there is a law defining it and punishments for engaging in it. Insider trading wasn’t a crime until some politicians made it a crime. Not everyone is in or wants to be in someone’s pocket. A proportional increase in people’s level of awareness AND their belief that they can effect positive change in the system is how a great many substantive reforms have been pushed through. Believing that it’s all futile is how people disengage and get fucked even more, or how people get desperate and do stupid things that make their lives worse.

And why do you think that more regulation would make markets unworkable? European markets have greater protections for retail investors and they still function... they just don’t function as the world’s biggest casino."
2021-05-06 18:57:40,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you fully appreciate how many regulations exist that are keeping the market far more sane than it could be at any point. 

The best regulations in my own opinion are ones that increase transparency and increase requirements that should require active approval (like retail approval to loan out shares). But the fact you can tell companies are short or holding large positions at all is only due to regulations, and better requirements for transparency help improve the market overall.

But absolutely naked shorting and even worse shit exists in environments with very minimal regulation.  

Essentially from my view you're falling victim to a confirmation bias, the only problems you notice are the squeaky wheels and regulations that didn't go far enough. And instead of deciding to fix them you've come to the conclusion that *actually* trying to fix things is the problem."

2021-05-06 18:17:55,wallstreetbets,"He already owned the stock. Why would exercising options make him an insider?

I do believe an insider is someone with knowledge or access to knowledge that the public doesn’t have access to in a publicly traded company. Based on that, insider trading is someone buying and selling at an advantage due to said non-public or insider information. 

Not a lawyer, but I don’t think that matters."

2021-05-06 19:34:48,wallstreetbets,"I think our difference in opinion stems from our beliefs in what government can accomplish and what/how we define personal responsibilities. 

I believe the onus is on the individual investor to know what they own, to understand what they own and how the market functions. At the same time, if the market wants people to invest, they have incentives to build confidence insure a good experience. 

One of my fundamental problems with regulations is that it leads people to becoming complacent and ignorant. They gain a false sense of security are still duped and taken for a ride and then feel cheated. 

All that being said, anything that leads to transparency is probably an alright idea that’s not in conflict with how I believe markets function best. Id just prefer it happen without the need for government intervention but ultimately the general public doesn’t care to pay enough attention. 

I’m ancap/libertarian leaning and know my views can be a little extreme compared to most. Ultimately I think we’ll always be screwed as long as the fed exists."

2021-05-06 16:44:21,wallstreetbets,Why would I have done that with console cycle coming in the fall. It really wasn’t that difficult of a play
2021-05-06 16:48:45,wallstreetbets,No one is jealous of a 3 month old account saying he bought GME at 2020 price lmao.   Sad little bag holder
2021-05-06 18:26:08,wallstreetbets,Good time for you all to average down
2021-05-06 17:57:02,wallstreetbets,25 @ 169
2021-05-06 18:57:54,wallstreetbets,I think Reddit is the only VIABLE info source for stocks etc all the mainstream are A SCAM
2021-05-06 19:00:11,wallstreetbets,I think if you watch and read comments you can learn more than any BS money mgr ceo or analyst that’s out there cause they’re paid to lie!! Double reports earnings stock tanks ... company doing terrible things going badly stock is soaring lol what a gang of shit
2021-05-06 19:03:00,wallstreetbets,"That's how I see it as well and its likely that was the sentiment of the laws when written..... But these POS that game the system for their advantage have teams of lawyers just for the purpose of creeping the definition of laws and are likely trying to claim that Reddit (even though its a PUBLIC forum) is some type of collusion by a group and therefore falls under ""insider trading"".

Even though there was NO collusion, just everyone liking the stock but these POS will try any underhanded technique to hold onto the corrupt system they have created for their own benifit!"
2021-05-06 19:49:23,wallstreetbets,"Everytime the guy updated, you’d see “if he’s in I’m in”. Well if he gets out, which he’s entitled to do whenever the fuck he wants, all those apes dump and the stock shits the bed enough for the ambulance chaser law firms to call manipulation and sue (again). It’s good to take his moves and his money out of the public eye."
2021-05-06 18:01:39,wallstreetbets,Does not seem like that is the motive here. but i get your point.
2021-05-06 19:57:04,wallstreetbets,"I noticed on other posts you talked about same day settlement or T+1 as the solution, you realize that T+2 mandate is a rule from the SEC right? 

Pretty much everything in the market that you think is fair is that way because a rule was set in place to make it so.

Transparency will never come on its own without government intervention. Transparency Is inherently not profitable because informational asymmetry IS profitable."
2021-05-06 17:45:46,wallstreetbets,Their what?
2021-05-06 16:51:32,wallstreetbets,Oh right. Only people who were part of WSB could buy Gme. I can post and joke about being down 200k not because I’m up so much from Gme still. You’re right. Silly me.
2021-05-06 19:16:02,wallstreetbets,This is seriously the way.
2021-05-06 18:24:11,wallstreetbets,40 @ 335
2021-05-06 19:45:48,wallstreetbets,"Yup. Lawyers are the problem. They take money to sway what meanings actually mean. 

Total garbage."
2021-05-06 18:01:28,wallstreetbets,What the hell is an exit strategy?
2021-05-06 19:43:21,wallstreetbets,From the drawing I see the exit strategies involve putting money back into the stock
2021-05-06 17:07:02,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure you can use Inspect Element idk why you think that's a flex.
Sad little bad holder"

2021-05-06 17:08:42,wallstreetbets,Lol inspect element? Don’t even know what that is.  Lol it’s a flex because only people who make big money aren’t bothered by big losses. You’re clearly super poor
2021-05-06 19:55:21,wallstreetbets,Thanks brah! I'm sure there are many more bag holders above 400. Cheers to them! 🤙
2021-05-06 17:14:32,wallstreetbets,How many shares do you still have? Nice play if you held through the January fuckery.
2021-05-06 17:17:11,wallstreetbets,"I sold during the hype.I was able to secure a bag that allowed me to comfortably quit my job that I hate. Average sold around 250. Happy with my decisions. The plan was always to let the hype die down and buy back in, because I truly do believe Ryan has something great planned. I got too comfortable. And I don’t chase so fucked that part up."
2021-05-06 17:23:18,wallstreetbets,Damn nice. I bought at $43 right before the squeeze. Sold after earnings at the littleral bottom 145 trying to play the dips. Fomo'd in a bit again and will hold to see what happens.
2021-05-06 17:24:42,wallstreetbets,I wish you luck.

2021-05-06 13:47:22,wallstreetbets,I live in a decent sized city and almost every business is hiring bc no one wants jobs because of unemployment and stimulus’s...
2021-05-06 13:57:46,wallstreetbets,There’s isn’t one word of another stimulus dumb dumbs
2021-05-06 13:36:50,wallstreetbets,"This article is a little confusing to my retard brain, are we getting another stimulus check or are more people getting their stimulus check?"
2021-05-06 15:20:47,wallstreetbets,Markets are racketed up to the tits. Correction onlay began
2021-05-06 14:00:51,wallstreetbets,More lazy people on the making. Less employees to find more stores closing and restaurants. Only Walmart and Amazon and they will have to go automated soon.
2021-05-06 14:54:21,wallstreetbets,I honestly think the whole market is going up tomorrow but I’m just a retard on Reddit what do I know.
2021-05-06 17:08:39,wallstreetbets,Great fundamentals! Lol rip 4th quarter
2021-05-06 13:49:49,wallstreetbets,"Stimulus doesn't help the market anymore. People have stored money that they are starting to spend. Inflation going up, interest rates going up, growth stocks going down."
2021-05-06 14:06:17,wallstreetbets,Ok but it’s fresh payments new money for the market 🤷🏽‍♂️
2021-05-06 14:18:40,wallstreetbets,Didn't he ask for 100 trillion once? He is set til 2027 if he asked for that.
2021-05-06 13:34:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah right, they will spend their ass off so they can say ""look how great the economy is""  then blame the fallback on someone else. And a mass amount of people are dumb enough to believe it"
2021-05-06 13:33:08,wallstreetbets,I’m sorry I can’t hear you over the sound OF THE MONEY PRINTER BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
2021-05-06 16:22:56,wallstreetbets,"Buy PLTR and RKT calls. Problem solved.  Money, unprinted"

2021-05-06 13:34:54,wallstreetbets,Like it makes a difference at this point
2021-05-06 14:03:45,wallstreetbets,It’s still a fresh round of payments. 🤦🏽‍♂️
2021-05-06 14:06:24,wallstreetbets,"Not only that, but if I can hold a work-from-home job that pays the same, why would i want to go to work?"
2021-05-06 13:54:58,wallstreetbets,Because our pseudo-capitalist state is finally failing.
2021-05-06 15:48:48,wallstreetbets,Would it be stimuli at this point?
2021-05-06 14:16:31,wallstreetbets,Really cause the title of the article says “Stimulus checks: IRS sends 1.1 million more payments in latest round” 🤷🏽‍♂️
2021-05-06 18:14:16,wallstreetbets,"Checks from old bills are finally going out to people that are now filing.

So, priced in."
2021-05-06 14:09:17,wallstreetbets,Either way more money for the market

2021-05-06 14:01:05,wallstreetbets,Yes the last two weeks it pulled back a bit. But the trend is overall going up since July and it will continue to rise over the next year
2021-05-06 13:53:00,wallstreetbets,Well he did increase spending while the same time cut taxes huge for corporations and the rich. I'm not trying to be political just stating facts.
2021-05-06 13:56:02,wallstreetbets,Que? I need this to take a few layers of inbred degeneracy off and for you to use context and evidence in a statement beyond hyperbolic expressions.
2021-05-06 14:02:22,wallstreetbets,Are you asking which broker I use or commenting on how money will be devalued if we keep printing it?
2021-05-06 14:15:16,wallstreetbets,It’s not a fresh payment to millions ? Lol ok boomer
2021-05-06 17:18:07,wallstreetbets,The point is there is more money in the economy for the markets to get another push
2021-05-06 15:58:40,wallstreetbets,The article was posted yesterday
2021-05-06 14:08:19,wallstreetbets,The money you use to buy stocks? The money other people need to buy stocks? 🤷🏽‍♂️ the new generation of people in the economy that need money to?

2021-05-06 13:44:05,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha ""technical analysis"" these patterns are no more accurate than having a voodoo priestess read some chicken bones. 
It always gives me a laugh to see ""X is going to make a major move, you can see the double cup and ballsack pattern clearly indicates..."""
2021-05-06 14:07:50,wallstreetbets,This is just so stupid. I love it.

2021-05-06 14:02:59,wallstreetbets,"Not only is it a symmetrical pattern but 20 and 50 SMA are flowing in an upward direction, I made this post kind of comical by putting the ⬆️⬇️ arrows but really it should just be biased towards bullish signal.

2021-05-06 17:42:50,wallstreetbets,"This is known in boomer-speak as ""Buy the rumor sell the news."" The rumor that Cohen was going to infiltrate Gamestop isn't some secret insider info that only WSB degenerates know. Chances are, if you know about some rumor, the information is already widespread. And so once substantial volume have positioned themselves before the news, what is this volume going to do after the news? A strange phenomenon known as ""taking profit.""

You can see this on earnings beats. Of course ""analysts"" can come up with an official-sounding number, but the market isn't forced to price in that exact expectation-- it expects whatever the hell it wants.

You can even see this in the biotech sector for FDA approvals. There's been studies done on how there are actually expected negative returns aggregated over hundreds of post-approval time frames. The people speculating on a price increase will close out immediately after the news is reported, not only to take profit, but because their thesis for the position (this piece of news is improperly priced) is gone as well.

Now, for surprising news, the market will move dramatically. For example: it shat its pants over TSLA's 1000%+ earnings beat that one time due to the sheer magnitude, or some biotech company got its drug denied by the FDA when everyone, including its CEO, thought it was a lock.

So, basically, to actually make big money through betting on news or that some piece of information is not priced in correctly, you either need really rare and esoteric information, (you need to be looking where no one else is) or you need to have a unique spin on some piece of existing common knowledge. Examples: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/stock-value-satellite-images-investing/586009/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/stock-value-satellite-images-investing/586009/), or DFV connecting the dots on a thesis that GME was actually valuable way before anyone else."

2021-05-06 13:25:28,wallstreetbets,"This is dumb. GME and MVIS, fundamentally, are garbage. They're not worth anything. MVIS has been a company for like 35 years and has never turned a profit. Not one single quarter. GME is not even worth $20/share, let alone whatever it is currently trading at, regardless of any moves they make.

Institutions hardly look at news, they look at P/E, EPS, book value, etc. This is also true for most mutual funds, indices, ETFs, etc. The only ones basically placing bets on high P/E companies are aggressive growth funds."
2021-05-06 16:01:26,wallstreetbets,"Lol are you smoking crack? Because MVIS does not have a working lidar,  it is a company making printer scanners and is working on a long range 'lidar', it does not even have a workig prototype yet. On the other hand  Velodyne Lidar , VLDR is a company that makes lidars, has a product and actually sells and generates revenue from lidar.

Stop writing a DD if you haven't actually done any research because some retard might actually believe you.

TLDR; OP is a true retard, hasn't done any research. MVIS is crap, does not even have a working lidar, VLDR on the other hand is a lidar manufacturer."

The people who decide the price of stocks don't care about what you're talking about. They care about 10-K and 10-Q reports, which no one here seems to ever read. Then they constantly ask why X stock is going down even though they're reporting good news, even though the company has a shit financial record. The CURRENT numbers are all that matter, especially now with the future looking bear. The smart money will start shifting their portfolios into safe stocks and away from aggressive growth."
2021-05-06 13:48:43,wallstreetbets,I like your words science man

Sure I have some boomer stuff and I'm into the lumber play. But I'm definetly not investing in biotech and tech for what their current earnings are"
2021-05-06 19:07:13,wallstreetbets,"Yes, which was great, but not all of it. So they're cost of production went from 125% in 2019 to 105% in 2020. They're also on the verge of bankruptcy. They've had to have 7 stock offerings in the past 2 years just to stay afloat. Trust me, I have researched this company. Currently, it is not good. Currently, money in this stock is a gamble. I do not know what the future holds, but right now this is not a good stock."
2021-05-06 19:11:19,wallstreetbets,"They are sitting on 70 million cash and their cost of production just went to close to 0%. The funny thing is that STM even promotes how MVIS tech is in the HL2 but MVIS can't talk about it due to the NDA. 

They will burn money this year, probably next year as well. But that's not what I'm in for there. They have the tech to make it, now let's see if their CEO gets shit done

2021-05-06 13:17:04,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure the question is fully thought out. Government debt does not work the same way as traditional debt and there are basic assumptions in your question I'm not sure totally make sense. There's a good planet money episode recently discussing the national debt that's a good resource
2021-05-06 13:12:36,wallstreetbets,the government is so deep in a hole they have use MMT.  period.  the end.
2021-05-06 13:23:09,wallstreetbets,"well, you got the last part right anyway. didn't you hear? the government is us."
2021-05-06 13:29:33,wallstreetbets,the government never loses
2021-05-06 13:54:15,wallstreetbets,"A lot of the pullback and caution in stocks is based on worries about inflation mostly based on the government's spending. I think the fears are overblown, and some inflation is good. Without it, the American economy was on its way to looking like the ""lost decade"" economy of Japan. The Fed's primary issues is to contain that inflation. The only time there's a worry about government debt in the U.S. is when a Democrat is in the White House."
2021-05-06 15:00:00,wallstreetbets,Does anybody lease think there is too much coincidence in every facet of govt in all nations at the same time?  Every country has deep internal divisions re: right and left wing politics. Every govt I’d printing money like it will have zero long term effect. Every govt is artificially keeping interest rates unsustainably low. Does anyone else see the problem brewing?  When things start to go south everyone will be effected the same bc we are all acting the same.
2021-05-06 13:39:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I wasn’t sure about the idea, do you remember which planet money episode it was thought? i looked through the last 15-20 but didn’t clearly see one that was about the debt."
2021-05-06 14:09:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah of course inflation is a necessary part of the economy but when 20 percent of money in circulation has been printed in the last year or whatever it was it shows that were in quite an extraordinary time right now. And my thoughts were just that after interest rates start increasing and the government has to begin refinancing, if there is some year or chunk of months where a huge amount of the debt is refinanced that could be some kind of triggering point."
2021-05-06 15:14:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I mean I think globalization is pretty much at fault for that. Basically every country's economy is almost totally and fundamentally reliant on every other country's economy nowadays so I wouldn't say its extremely strange that all these governments are acting the same. Also it's not like we have very different economic or governmental systems around the world like we did during the cold war. Outside of a few very exceptional cases like venezuela or north korea, basically every country just works off of some version of neoliberalism now."
2021-05-06 13:45:36,wallstreetbets,"Feb 24th - Bond Voyage...it's a good one. Economics gets so fucking wonky when you get that high up on the scale, it's hard to comprehend.

I was thinking the other day how peculiar it is that on a global scale, an event (like COVID) can cause losses across the board worldwide. As in, it's not a zero sum game where one country's loss is another's gain, it's possible for everyone to all lose at the same time. What a strange system we've invented and become enslaved by"
2021-05-06 15:12:57,wallstreetbets,"> the government has to begin refinancing

It's not like refinancing a house. The government issues more instruments to finance it's debt. The yield on those instruments may fluctuate and, once again, it's about policies to manage those rates. Over the last 15 years none of these things act as they once did, but people still expect they will."
2021-05-06 14:02:55,wallstreetbets,"Thanks I’ll definitely take a look at it. And totally agree on the second point, some things that happen just seem so arbitrary when looking at the surface level"
2021-05-06 15:33:20,wallstreetbets,So you mean none of the government's debt are like conventional loans that can be refinanced or am I misunderstanding? I know a significant amount of it is made up of instruments like bonds but I'd imagine some of the debt is made up of other kinds as well?
2021-05-06 15:51:36,wallstreetbets,"That's right. And the U.S. government's biggest creditor is: the U.S. government. Not China. And the last time I looked, the Netherlands was a bigger creditor than China, but the Dutch are less scary to the people who get people riled up over this stuff."

2021-05-06 16:46:43,wallstreetbets,At the leverage amount I stand to make ~200% if the usd drops to 6 yuan. With the 20X margin. Plus the carried interest which could be an extra 20% a year.

2021-05-06 15:39:03,wallstreetbets,Someone crushed the vol on the stock first thing this morning producing a nice selloff. I'm expecting a positive day tomorrow after people realize the good earnings.
2021-05-06 12:59:51,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit, this is Viacom. Yeah im getting in on this"
2021-05-06 13:59:10,wallstreetbets,Hey what do you know I am already bagholding
2021-05-06 16:03:07,wallstreetbets,Bought in a couple of weeks ago right after the Archegeddon. Thought this ER blowout would be the catalyst to recovering some of that blowup. Seems there is still a ton of downside pressure or institutions playing games.
2021-05-06 14:27:26,wallstreetbets,I am buying more shares and have a buy order waiting to get hit.
2021-05-06 16:44:19,wallstreetbets,800$ worth of shares.... I thought this was wall street bets
2021-05-06 16:58:33,wallstreetbets,"Incredibly undervalued !!

I am holding and going to the beach"
2021-05-06 18:19:15,wallstreetbets,"Was disappointed it didn’t bounce today but I’m holding until it’s green. This stock does not phase me, it pays a dividend and the worst thing that could happen is getting stuck holding it underwater for a while. They have a good chance of kicking butt with their streaming services, earnings were impressive, leadership is improved, so I’m happy to go long. 

VIAC is like NOK to me. I have no issues holding the shares if they lose value in the near term. They have good future prospects and demonstrated they are moving in the right direction."
2021-05-06 18:43:41,wallstreetbets,"Those fuckers (HF and whoever joins them) keep pushing VIAC below 40$ for a reason.

For me VIAC goes same as GME, AMC, etc...

I'm long 1.5K@42$ and adding more as it keeps dipping. Enjoying the quarterly 24c div and have enough patience.

We'll be back to 80s!!"

2021-05-06 13:06:00,wallstreetbets,"damn, i am buying on credit money"
2021-05-06 14:15:14,wallstreetbets,I agree I’m buying my first shares today
2021-05-06 15:40:52,wallstreetbets,In with 500 shares.

2021-05-06 14:15:45,wallstreetbets,Every time i see a new VIAC post I buy a put
2021-05-06 13:43:07,wallstreetbets,Right but you also gotta remember that nothing has anything to do with nothing no more so🤷🏼‍♂️
2021-05-06 14:38:33,wallstreetbets,"~~Assets minus liabilities are less than the market cap. I like your thinking, but that is not quite correct.~~ Edit... I am an idiot."
2021-05-06 12:58:06,wallstreetbets,Thank you for putting this research. I am buying more today as its now a big time opportunity to own really great stock.
2021-05-06 14:42:27,wallstreetbets,all that writing for barely any views. people are aware of Viacom and any high shorted stock wont be moving much at anytime.
2021-05-06 13:06:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, SBH, sally f-ing beauty jumps $4 on earnings and VIAC goes down….WTAF!!!?"
2021-05-06 13:15:29,wallstreetbets,"I was pretty that the earning was tomorrow.

EDIT : pretty sure -_-"
2021-05-06 13:47:55,wallstreetbets,"I don't know about undervalued,  it got blown up in value by Bill hwang. It may look like a value because it's not inflated like everything else on the market. It's still trading at more than it was 6 months ago."
2021-05-06 15:28:30,wallstreetbets,VIAC is a value trap...
2021-05-06 14:47:37,wallstreetbets,"oh, look how undervalued is the stock that was $18 a year ago and today is $36"
2021-05-06 15:18:25,wallstreetbets,I remember DG was in this situation twice recently.  took a month or two to recover but it was worth it the first time and would have been a multibagger the second time but I was doing stupid plays at the time
2021-05-06 15:25:45,wallstreetbets,"The part about assets<->market cap is incorrect. As there are liabilities, you should look at the equity = assets - liabilities, which is 15B. Versus 24B market cap, it's still very good. It means that when you buy a stock you have coverage for 62% to retain the value."
2021-05-06 17:05:11,wallstreetbets,Isn't credit suisse still liquidating their leftover position?
2021-05-06 17:07:44,wallstreetbets,Bill Hwuang back at it boyzzzz
2021-05-06 17:09:24,wallstreetbets,"In all fairness, most tech/growth stocks have been plummeting lately... even after fantastic earnings."
2021-05-06 17:11:06,wallstreetbets,Ok hwuang
2021-05-06 16:18:48,wallstreetbets,"hello my friend from credit suisse, still need to dump Billy's bag?"
2021-05-06 17:54:41,wallstreetbets,Gme
2021-05-06 14:34:56,wallstreetbets,"Not sure I'd get on this just yet.  Fidelity says that only 4 ETPs own decent shares in this, so I'm gonna guess it has more room to fall."
2021-05-06 16:26:15,wallstreetbets,The only downside is that 2/3 of their revenue still comes from their traditional TV business.
2021-05-06 12:59:48,wallstreetbets,same this earnings report was stellar and theyre gonna be paying off their debt. im sure with my luck the market will crash and viac will go to $20 a share
2021-05-06 17:43:45,wallstreetbets,"If you look at the call/put option, there are crap tons of call options expiring this month. Most of the call options are sold by big hedge funds, therefor they need to keep the price low until all these options expire worthless. The hedges know the stock is undervalued but need to wait for the options to expire."
2021-05-06 16:30:05,wallstreetbets,It’s being pushed down. Long calls. Year out. ITM if you can. Should go by end of year. Also buy shares.
2021-05-06 13:35:52,wallstreetbets,Added 500 more to mine now at 3500@40.44
2021-05-06 16:08:12,wallstreetbets,It did at opening. Then went down.
2021-05-06 13:27:11,wallstreetbets,But couple SMA on weekly chart is showing further drop
2021-05-06 17:55:18,wallstreetbets,Booooo. No fun!  But good for you the last month
2021-05-06 13:29:58,wallstreetbets,You are pretty
2021-05-06 13:33:57,wallstreetbets,You're still pretty.  Don't listen to the haters.
2021-05-06 17:19:51,wallstreetbets,"Based on the earnings report today, this is not true.

Maybe you misunderstand what a value trap is. SEC chair Gensler explains it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)"
2021-05-06 15:27:04,wallstreetbets,">a year ago

A year ago there was no streaming revenue channel. Today there is and it's growing. Also last year PlutoTV was very small, today it has shown to be a major asset.

So, last year, at 18$ it may have been fairly priced, today at 36$ it's definitely undervalued."
2021-05-06 16:37:04,wallstreetbets,Is a stock that was $5 a year ago but now $160 today better?
2021-05-06 18:23:22,wallstreetbets,A year ago the pandemic hit ... everything dropped .
2021-05-06 18:24:54,wallstreetbets,Can you explain which numbers are different from op's?
2021-05-06 13:07:26,wallstreetbets,Really confused why it's down so hard today. Hopefully it will get some good action tomorrow.
2021-05-06 14:54:38,wallstreetbets,"It's not flying today because no one truly knows if there are still large lots waiting to be offloaded once the prices come back a bit.  Take a look at the trends right before the pandemic started.   The upper trend line extended to now is almost exactly where we are today, and is more than likely pushing the stock down as it breaks back into a 1-year-old channel."
2021-05-06 16:25:06,wallstreetbets,Been my experience earnings add little predictability to the immediate price of a stock unless they're super god awful.  As with any investment there are countless outside factors to consider which can effect the price of an investment.  Uber killed earnings estimates yesterday down 8% F beats earnings 76% here comes life's surprise fuck you been lower since the 28th earnings release.
2021-05-06 16:10:02,wallstreetbets,"Wait should I buy rn, or do you think it will drop lower??"
2021-05-06 15:56:40,wallstreetbets,Sorry about that

2021-05-06 19:24:17,wallstreetbets,thats fkd up!!!
2021-05-06 16:32:09,wallstreetbets,Plus new memberships was great.
2021-05-06 13:14:20,wallstreetbets,"Because it’s a high beta stock, fagguette"

2021-05-06 13:26:58,wallstreetbets,-0.2 is high beta?

I also like being called a gay french bread. Original name lol."
2021-05-06 17:18:12,wallstreetbets,"I hope so, I'm -18% now in NIO"
2021-05-06 14:08:44,wallstreetbets,"nio pleas fly 

40C 05/28/21"
2021-05-06 15:25:09,wallstreetbets,NIO and XPEV to the moon. Ain’t selling for nothing.
2021-05-06 14:44:10,wallstreetbets,Lol every time NIO comes out with good news. Hedge Funds sweep the profits through price manipulation.
2021-05-06 12:56:59,wallstreetbets,It is so cheap right now wow
2021-05-06 13:21:11,wallstreetbets,Nio has a bright future. Would buy now. China is pushing hard on EV and to be emission free in 2060. Nio sales increasing YOY.
2021-05-06 15:29:53,wallstreetbets,Some of the comments in here is why I’m bullish. Please continue to doubt the emergence of a global Chinese EV player. It gives me more time to buy
2021-05-06 13:07:11,wallstreetbets,Does anyone really think it’s a good idea to trust a cheap Chinese knock off with autonomously driving them around?
2021-05-06 17:07:41,wallstreetbets,"Nio has no chance in Europe. Europe is full of superior OEMs with already very low margins. Nio has no comparative advantage against companies like VW and Europeans in general don't like Chinese goods, it's still viewed as low quality garbage. VW is set to become #1 EV maker in 2025, has already multiple models with great built quality and solid powertrain on the market, Ionity network of chargers in disposal, great brand recognition, strong dealership network and at price of current EVs it's not just VW Nio will compete with, it's Volvo+Polstar, Jaguar, BMW, entry level Mercedes and mainstream automakers like Renault, Peugeot+Citroen+Opel, Fiat - a lot of them share massive R&D budget for EVs."
2021-05-06 13:17:17,wallstreetbets,"I live in Norway and I don’t think people trust anything cheap here. I don’t think it will sell well here, Norwegians have enough money that Teslas are not a problem and people prefer the status."
2021-05-06 13:58:47,wallstreetbets,"I think expansion Is a bad idea for Nio, the should concentrate on nailing China"
2021-05-06 13:37:32,wallstreetbets,"Nio? The company that had to be saved financially by the Chinese government? 

Don’t they need huge infantruture investments of battery swapping stations all over the place to even be viable to drive? yeah, no thanks"

2021-05-06 16:50:08,wallstreetbets,buy LEAPS or shares especially on growth companies if u wanna make money and not just gamble
2021-05-06 13:23:13,wallstreetbets,No it’s not. Still valued at 60 billion with less than 2 billion in revenue per year. It’s leverage at 30x current yearly cashflow.
2021-05-06 13:07:14,wallstreetbets,Said everyone when looking at the price tag of something made in China
2021-05-06 15:02:47,wallstreetbets,I think the biggest thing that NIO has going for them as a differentiator is their battery as a service model (BaaS)
2021-05-06 13:38:22,wallstreetbets,Isn't *Bright Future* what the CCP call internment camps?
2021-05-06 14:50:22,wallstreetbets,"Nio really isnt a knock off or cheap, infact their cars get rated more highly than tesla in most assessments"
2021-05-06 13:23:26,wallstreetbets,"So is every electric automaker a Tesla knockoff till the end of time?

NIO did $2.5B in revenue last year.

But yea, there’s always a risk with Chinese stocks"
2021-05-06 13:10:41,wallstreetbets,"Chinese companies make me nervous, I'm down on Alibaba, great company and great growth, if they were American or European I'd be balls deep"
2021-05-06 14:28:44,wallstreetbets,Nio isn't cheap though
2021-05-06 14:51:53,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is only status cuz it was the only proper ev till now. Look at vids of the nio cars, they are way more about quality than tesla and many others. In fact they are all about quality and service. 
Teslas are neat and fun and decent looking, but they aren’t quality per se."
2021-05-06 17:08:20,wallstreetbets,"Nio is way better than Tesla. Seriously, look at their cars and specs. Leagues ahead."
2021-05-06 13:28:38,wallstreetbets,You mean the chips failing cars busting into flames and recalling a couple thousand vehicles is not a problem? Love the stonk but wouldn't be caught dead driving a tesla cause I don't wanna be caught dead. And fuck the chinese and their book tinkering gov manipulated companies. Burnt myself once too many on that shit.
2021-05-06 17:11:05,wallstreetbets,Success in Europe gives them credibility in China.
2021-05-06 14:31:36,wallstreetbets,They charge normally too
2021-05-06 14:53:11,wallstreetbets,Wow you really spent longer writing a comment than you did researching that nio users can also charge their cars
2021-05-06 15:54:33,wallstreetbets,"I worked in China as a consultant, there swapping batteries is a huge thing. Why charge a battery when you can simply get one already full in just a sec? What you see as a weakness, it’s actually them being a step ahead and differentiating from the competition, I believe."
2021-05-06 18:59:16,wallstreetbets,Please teach me the ways. What are LEAPs and will my Canadian e-broker sell them to me?
2021-05-06 13:38:25,wallstreetbets,"I mean, just depends entirely on how you think they will grow.

They’re a relatively young company, and they reported more than $2B in revenue in 2020 (2.4B, I believe), and are just now expanding to other parts of the world

They’ve doubled their sale numbers the last two years and are on pace to more than quadruple them in 2021"
2021-05-06 13:37:55,wallstreetbets,"Well, this year out of them all, you've learned that valuation doesnt mean a thing in this market. You're going to tell me that Tesla's valuation compares to Toyota's ? with the amount of cars sold ? Co'mon"
2021-05-06 13:10:21,wallstreetbets,This is what I came to ask. Chinese knock off again right?
2021-05-06 13:28:51,wallstreetbets,"Not everyone of them, Chinese knock offs are shit.. use your wrinkles ape

Edit: everyone on this sub just downvotes anything negative about the bags they are holding and there are a lot of NIO bag holders here, I’m out"
2021-05-06 13:41:40,wallstreetbets,"187 death to date, 6 of which were on auto pilot. What deaths are you talking about exactly?"
2021-05-06 19:49:53,wallstreetbets,"Long term
Equity
AnticiPation
Strategy.

High delta, low theta ITM calls.  Simulates buying shares at a lower cost.  Also has the risk of expiring unlike a share."
2021-05-06 19:27:45,wallstreetbets,"options that have long expiration, eg 1 year"
2021-05-06 13:40:00,wallstreetbets,Nah. Doesn’t matter. There is a pattern that exists for Chinese companies and it is not favorable to US investors.
2021-05-06 13:41:58,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is an anomaly but additionally Elon has spun the dialogue around his company to not even be valued as an auto maker. Instead it is apparently green energy, climate change, subscription based autonomous driving, auto maker. NIO is barely an automaker 3 years into its career."
2021-05-06 13:14:34,wallstreetbets,Bingo
2021-05-06 14:02:17,wallstreetbets,"He's a true idiot,  probably drives a Ford pinto"
2021-05-06 14:13:46,wallstreetbets,It's an expression. Was referring to technical problems as you're making statements on status and quality. Gonna be alot easier to drive your tesla if you take that stick outta ur ass.
2021-05-06 13:46:38,wallstreetbets,"Well that’s just a stupidly overgeneralized argument, but ok.  

Yes, being a Chinese company is certainly something to consider, but to brush it off entirely solely because of that..."
2021-05-06 14:50:41,wallstreetbets,Tesla is an etf comprised of many overvalued components.
2021-05-06 14:39:48,wallstreetbets,"This. 

Tesla isn’t a car company, it’s a tech company that makes cars. Don’t compare NIO to Tesla. Just don’t."
2021-05-06 14:28:33,wallstreetbets,How could you tell. Bought it from the tendies on the puts I bought on $RKT. How's that one working out for you? Paper handed that bitch yet or still holding the bag?😂
2021-05-06 14:49:42,wallstreetbets,Citing exact situations isn't an expression.
2021-05-06 15:11:05,wallstreetbets,A very astute observation.

Dear sir/madam,

I am writing in relation to a recent purchase which I am not fully satisfied with. On April 22nd I purchased additional shares of Virgin Galactic in your discount sale and have since found their performance to be unsuitable and lacking, and after not heeding my previous requests to pleas fly again I would therefore like to return them for a full refund. Would you kindly be able to process this request for me?

Thank you for your time,

2021-05-06 19:30:10,wallstreetbets,"Man. I was up 93k profit at GME's peak and ended up selling at 40k profit. That decision still haunts me to this day, and caused several nervous breakdowns. I can only imagine what 1 million felt like. Hope your mental is doing well."

2021-05-06 15:42:08,wallstreetbets,Get a real broker asshole Robinhood gonna fuck you good - you lyke getting fucked by vladdy baby?
2021-05-06 16:44:50,wallstreetbets,"I can understand not cashing out if you had shares as I had a few hundred and was up like $400k, but what is the logic of not selling your option contracts which will eventually expire worthless? Given the expiration on those, it looks you bought weeklies so you had to know that you couldn't hold onto them much longer. Were you planning on holding onto them until right before expiration or something?"
2021-05-06 16:56:53,wallstreetbets,You don't have a Lambo and you never will 😏
2021-05-06 17:02:31,wallstreetbets,"So basically OP got distracted by fake FOMO weedstock hype after killing it with GME.

2021-05-06 18:21:14,wallstreetbets,All short term stuff cancels out. You don't have to pay 500k taxes this year if you lost 800k.

2021-05-06 13:17:57,wallstreetbets,Exactly what I was thinking. Would of took the 1.2 mill put it into safe stocks and collect the dividends and played with those
2021-05-06 15:13:39,wallstreetbets,"you don't even have to cash out all the way. with 1m, take out 800 and play with 200. if you were ever gonna make more money, you'd still do it with 200k. why risk 1m? it's insanely stupid."

2021-05-06 18:21:45,wallstreetbets,You damn right!
2021-05-06 16:42:39,wallstreetbets,This is WSB not theta gang. Who buys and sells here based on tax effects?
2021-05-06 17:15:37,wallstreetbets,"So the easy way to avoid is just to get out of the big losing positions for a month before the end of year, right?  So before Dec 1, you make sure you're not holding any positions in the big losers?"

2021-05-06 14:52:25,wallstreetbets,Yes. I was led to believe that was the point of this sub
2021-05-06 16:06:14,wallstreetbets,Unrealized gains are just that...unreal. You didn't lose any money. It's all a fugazi.
2021-05-06 15:51:18,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, shit happens. Thanks for the honest answer"
2021-05-06 18:12:57,wallstreetbets,Fully agree. Same boat. Risk reward was there.
2021-05-06 15:29:35,wallstreetbets,"Hi. I feel you. I did that, and then did the exact same thing with RKT. The universe wanted me to have money but I didn't take it and I think it gave up on me cause all I've done thus far is lose \~300k. Is there a therapy group for me."
2021-05-06 19:08:24,wallstreetbets,"~~Not if you’re trading the same stock over and over within 30-day time frames...~~

~~Look up wash sales.  If you buy back into the same company within 30 days of selling it, and you end up losing on that second trade and decide to cash out for a loss, you can’t use that loss against your gains.~~

~~Hypothetically if someone bought into GME and made $1mil and cashed out, then a week later decided to buy back into GME at the top, and it crashed and he cashes out for a $1mil loss.  He is now going to owe taxes on $1mil still, even though he lost all the gains. Because it’s a wash sale.  And he’s fucked.~~


~~Now I’m not sure how option trading works for wash sales. I’ve never looked into it before, but for just trading stocks Wash Sales are a very real thing.~~

Edit: I stand corrected and I’m a dumbass who didn’t even know what Wash Sales were, lol.  I also deserve to be on this subreddit."

First of all, if you make $1 mil the first time and lose money the second time, that is not a wash sale because **you did not close your first trade at a loss.** 

Second, let's say someone makes $1 mil and cashes out. Then a week later, he buys back into the GME and loses all his gains. Then, as long as the person closed all his positions within the same tax year, they can deduct their losses against the $1 mil gain. In your hypothetical situation, they only get into trouble if as follows:

Person makes $1 mil gain in 2020 and cashes out.

2021 comes, and person yolos all his earnings and loses it all without paying taxes for his 2020 gains."

I did the share voting power count.

So unrestricted shares are 5,16%
(Founder Abel A holds 88% through 10x C class shares).

It means that tomorrow when Russell does their preliminary list AST will make the 5% Russell 2000 index inclusion criteria.

The moment that is common knowledge ppl will rush to buy the stock before the 10 ETFs tracking this index must do so on june 28th.

I consider this little discussed fact one of the main catalyst this side of years end and BW3.

I’ve been deep here since it was a spac as NPA. 

The float here is tiny and volatile. It’s been hedged/shorted against pipe(institutional investors) since their shares are locked up for over a year(usually a great thing), but they needed to lock in profit somehow. The price has been artificially kept low on low volume. Huge amount of the float is locked up with 💎🙏 And same with the warrants. If you can handle big ups and down and the potential for a $250-$1000 stock in the next 3-7 years, LETS GO! 

I have 3500 shares and 4100 warrants and am adding more as I get a chance. 

Many catalysts this year from analyst coverage, PT’s from that coverage, BW3 launching this year(look it up), 5G rural fund($9 billion fund ASTS has potential to get a big chunk of that), and much more.

2021-05-06 13:19:53,wallstreetbets,"Excellent post! 

Something else to consider is that the vast majority of ASTS shares are actually locked up until April 2022. I believe there's only 51 million shares currently available out of the total 181 million that will become available when management and the Pipe Investors shares unfreeze.and become tradeable. 

So while the company has a total market cap that exceeds 1 billion, only a portion of that total market cap is currently up for trade. 

This stock has all sorts of potential to rocket on good news and ultimately any lame bear arguments have an expiration date - when BlueWalker 3 (BW3) launches in late Q4 2021. BW3 validates the technology again because it is a small scale of the final product set to be deployed in 2022 with equtorial coverage ( accessing up to 1.6 billion clients).

The beautiful thing is the 50/50 profit sharing model with partners like Vodafone. Customer acquisition costs are covered entirely by Vodafone, but because they get 50% of the profit and Space Mobile will help them crush their competition and expand into new markets without terrestrial cell towers they will be heavily motivated to sell Space Mobile!

This thing is going to be a FCF machine! The initial phase 1 will cover 1.6B people around the equatorial region in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Global coverage will expand from there. This initial.group of 1.6B are craving for connection and many are completely un-connected because they are rural populations. While they are poor, the social, education, medical, safety, and economic opportunities they can access via mobile connectivity is a major incentive for them to want this ( remember they don't have internet in many of these places). So even if only 200 million of the 1.6B sign up and pay the $2 a months that's still 400M a month. The partner telecom gets 50% so they get $1 and we get $1. So 200M for them and $200M for us monthly or 1.2B annually for just phase 1! 

Let me break down how significant that is. ASTS will have very few costs to maintain their network once placed in space. They estimate for every dollar of revenue they will spend only 10 cents to earn it. That is astounding, but it makes sense when you recognize there is very little manpower needed to maintain space assets once in space. So that 1.2B of annual revenue will generate FCF of about 1.08B or $6 FCF per share. That's just from the equatorial region. More will come from the more economic prosperous areas where ASTS will change more. 

But $6 FCF per share is nothing to sneeze at, especially since the company will be completely debt free. ATT has something like 180B in debt and generates $3.82 FCF per share. What do you think a debt free company with a growing custer base ( the rest of the world) that generates $6 FCF per share would be worth per share? If ATT shares are $32, there's no reason to believe put shares wouldn't be 3x ($100 per share) that because of the $6 FCF per share with zero debt.

I think it's completely plausible that ASTS will be worth at least $100 per share by end of 2023 or sooner. If the company maintains a monopoly or at worst case a duolopy globally by 2024-2025 there shares will be trading easily in the $200-$400 range as revenue accelerates like crazy from the underconnected and disconnected parts of the world. 

But let's go back to the potential for a GME squeeze between now and the BW3 launch. With enough of us buying and holding it will cause the shorts to cover. When BW3 launches and is successful as all signs point to, the final serious bear argument is destroyed and significant interest will pour into ASTS....which will cause the shorts to cover even harder. If we start to dry up the supply of existing shares, like I said earlier there's not that many, we can GMe 2.0 this easily. 

Why do we want to GME 2.0? Well, destroying shorts is good, but it also serves a business purpose. The company says they will generate about $1.2B in 2023 and that will be used to fund phase 2, but if we spike the share price up on the backs of the shorts to $75-$100 this December, it would allow the company to dilute us by 15% and have 2x the cash needed for phases 2-3 or complete global coverage. They could expedite the roll out of the entire network and by 2024 or sooner have a global network up and running before any serious Competitors could establish themselves. 

Ensuring they are the monopoly will generate massive FCF! They already conservatively project $16B revenue by 2030 with global coverage. We could speed that number up to 2025 or 2026 and the stock would easily be worth something outlandish like $1000 because the FCF per share would be an amazing $51 per share! 

You can do the math yourself from their investor presentation and verify my math. The case I've presented here is real. A GME 2.0 opportunity exists between now and BW3. An opportunity to get even more rich also exists between BW3 and 2024-2027 timeframe. This is the most asymetrical trade of your life. The reward to risk ratio is heavily in your favor.

Seriously it is. 

So between now December 2021, there's room for plenty of catalysts (for example: new partnerships announced, progress with BW3, customer pre-orders through our exclusive partners of Rakuten, Vodafone, and ATT)  which will bump the stock up.

Let's GME 2.0 this between now and BW3 while the available shares for trade are limited. Let's make the shorts pay and position the company to expedite establishing a global monopoly FCF cash cow like you could only dream of. This is your and my ticket to exteme wealth!

2021-05-06 16:24:51,wallstreetbets,"A few notes. 

\#1. AST owns Nanoavionics. A company that tripled their revenue last year and projects to be worth 500mil by 2025.  It's not an asymmetric play.

\#2. Just as Solidstate batteries in a lab doesn't mean it will work at scale, the success of BW1, does little to assuage fears that the technology might not be able to scale.  Having a satellite in orbit communicate with a single mobile phone is much different than having a satellite in orbit communicate with 500 mobile phones. You're underselling that risk big time.

There are a few more I don't have time to get into at the moment.  All in all though a good breakdown.  I plan to release a breakdown myself as we get closer to BW3, as I don't think the average wsb investor has the attention span to hold a highly speculative stock for 6+ months."
2021-05-06 17:16:42,wallstreetbets,"Their satellite constellation's total data throughput capacity means they can provide a \*very few\* number of users with 4g and (maybe) 5g coverage, or lots of users with 2g coverage, but not both.

They're not breaking the laws of physics.  Their constellation is about the same size as Globalstar, and serves handsets about the same size.  Therefore we should expect similar performance. Globalstar lets you \*text\* anywhere in the world, for a high but not astronomical price.

To achieve 5g-speed coverage of the entire globe for lots of people, SpaceX's StarLink needs \~100x more satellites and the end user's antenna needs to be \~100x bigger. AND they use Ku- and Ka-band radios, whereas cell phones use (And by extension ASTS uses) much slower frequencies capping out in the C-band.

You can think Globalstar or Iridium are good investments if you want, but if you don't think Globalstar has a $1T TAM, ASTS doesn't have it either, and you're just falling for hype.

Towers are prized assets, partly because contracts to use them are like  an “infinite marriage” in which operators pay steady rates for decades. Its not strange that Vodafone or other big companies invested in this just as a measure of ""if it works"". That same Vodafone did IPO for his Vantage Towers company in march for 13B evaluation. The company is in the possession of 82.000 towers!   
I don't know, am not buying it.  What is gone stop Tesla from doing the same thing? Or anybody else that is gone send their satellites in space?  
 I would be really careful in investing in this company."

2021-05-06 16:30:08,wallstreetbets,"Add to your risk category:  NASA objects to AST Spacemobile's plans:   https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/nasa-objects-to-new-megaconstellation-citing-risk-of-catastrophic-collison/

An objection from NASA is very rare.  And NASA's word carries significant weight with the FCC, which is the regulatory agency that decides whether or not AST Spacemobile will be allowed to deploy their constellation.

The problem NASA has with ASTS is that they want to deploy 263 extremely large satellites (each satellite has a 900-square meter phased array antenna to communicate with cell phones on the ground-- size of a baseball diamond).  Large number of extremely large satellites = increased collision risk in space.  If they can't work this out to NASA and FCC's satisfaction, they won't be allowed to deploy.

Which would affect the value of LEAPS and shares."

This software sounds super powerful and the most important part of the business! Being able to pre-process the data so that the satellites and end user devices don’t need to do any work is just brilliant. 

The dishes themselves seems like they are just repeaters/boosters and don’t actually do any processing/modulating. Which is a great thing and can mean they could use other hardware down the road or be compatible with other dish networks and upgraded networks and don’t necessarily need to waste money on keeping up with their own manufacturing of dishes as the satellite networks grow globally. 

These guys have SaaS and nobody even knows it yet. 

I’m convinced now, lol."

Short story:
Me, full of cum joins wsb in 2018.

I see a lot of people think a crash is coming in early 2020, I sign up a Tastyworks account with $1k funded.

Buy SPY puts, go to 10k.

Buy NIO calls, go to 40k.

Buy GME shares in August (after Ryan Cohen news) and again in early January, sold at $367 because I had an interview the next day and did not want to be watching GME.

Had some other wins and losses here and there but that's the jist."

2021-05-06 14:47:37,wallstreetbets,"Apparently there will be several price plans (24h, 1 week, monthly), and it will depend as well on the country. In the poorer countries the monthly fee will be around 2 dollars, in the richer ones it can range from 5 to 25 dollars depending on data speed, data cap, etc...

2021-05-06 15:44:36,wallstreetbets,"They are different services. And I would say they are complementary.

Starlink needs a dish antenna connected to a ""router"" (and it needs to be plugged to an electricity source). So it's intended to provide connectivity to a house for example.

Spacemobile provides connectivity straight away to a cell phone (calls + data)."

2021-05-06 17:33:53,wallstreetbets,"I'm not even \*that\* knowledgeable in the field, but the fact that even I can calculate they have major bandwidth problems--which the CEO never addresses in any of his public communications--is one of the reasons I really hate this company. They're purposefully over-promising to sell their shares to people who want to believe in this stuff but don't have EE degrees to run the numbers.   


Long story short there's no real way to compare Starlink satellites to ASTS satellites apples-to-apples, since Starlink's user terminals are much bigger and can point their transmitting and ""listening,"" whereas cell phones (ASTS's terminal) can't.  Also, like I said, ASTS's satellites operate on lower-frequency (and thus lower-datarate) signals. IF you had to make Starlink compatible with cell-phones with those restrictions, any given ASTS sat is probably more capable than any given Starlink sat (That huge-ass solar panel/phased array antenna that ASTS flies isn't for nuthin').  But of course that's not the restriction space we're working with here; in the real world the constraints ASTS puts on itself by requiring itself to be compatible with cell phones means its service will be painfully slow if it's used by more than a tiny group of freakishly wealthy people."

2021-05-06 18:51:10,wallstreetbets,I actually did my thesis on satellites way back in 2010.

2021-05-06 18:11:17,wallstreetbets,"They are low earth orbit.... But they're a stand alone carrier using sat phones.

They would have to be extremely creative if they wanted to enter the smartphone market. Would they do so as a standalone carrier? If so would their rates be competitive, and could they deliver to a wide enough audience with their bandwidth? If they go this route, they'll be stepping on the toes of juggernauts.

Or do they supplement existing networks like ASTS? If so, is it going to eat into their current customer base since I'd imagine they'd have to retool their constellation.

All this said, they're currently not a competitor. They've indicated they might enter this space, but from what I've read they have funding problems.

I get ASTS is speculative too, but this is their only aim whereas GSAT is in a different space. Maybe some people see GSAT as more proven since they're in a similar market, to them I say good luck. I'll take my chances with a company being created purely for smartphones."

2021-05-06 18:21:17,wallstreetbets,My confidence in GSAT is based on their bandwidth patent which as you have said has a slightly different but in my opinion no less lucrative niche use with global communication.

2021-05-06 13:33:54,wallstreetbets,This is the WAY
2021-05-06 18:27:18,wallstreetbets,thats because everyone has been coming into money to invest is young enough to not be so dumb as to pay some suit cuck 2k a year to manage a portfolio when they can do it for free online.
2021-05-06 18:35:42,wallstreetbets,see this is the shit i wish i read 3-5 weeks ago so I could have sold a bunch of calls instead of sitting out the past month.

2021-05-06 14:38:56,wallstreetbets,Inflation signs have been all over the place. Rates are only staying where they are because the fed wants it to protect against a straight up market crash. Yellen had a senior moment and said rates were going to increase with all this inflation until Powell snapped her out of it.

Fed admitting that interest rates may have to rise sooner than expected (or at least for Canada to do so, making it more obvious that USA should as well).

Berkshire Hathaway closing on deals (they're value oriented, sitting on cash, waiting for opportunities too).

2021-05-06 13:43:17,wallstreetbets,"I don't see RKT going back up, EVER, based on anything related to mortgages.  It WILL go back up, when there is a catalyst unrelated to the housing market.  Rates are going to slowly rise, the housing market is going to cool off, and their margin on originations is going to continue to get narrower.  This exact guidance is why the stock is dropping, not because they missed EPS by .01.  They went public in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime market, and they will probably never get back to a 5%+ origination margin such as they had in the first year of public trading."

Not ideal but im not worried. still very courious how this played out as report didnt seem that bad to me.

$1600

Steel futures in 2018?
$900

Steel in 2011?
$900

Steel in 2008?
$1300 (or so).

Look at the stock prices vs steel futures. Lots has changed over time, but CLF is on track for $4b EBITDA in 2021, roughly $2b in profit, and that is on an average steel price of $1100."

2021-05-06 16:36:23,wallstreetbets,"Ironically, if I had bought GME instead of some of my other plays at the time I would be further ahead.

Still long a significant amount of GME .. but all-in has been the the move lately.

Godspeed you wrinkly brained ape. Godspeed."

2021-05-06 17:12:15,wallstreetbets,What’s the end game here? The market makers are never going to allow a squeeze. At best it’ll keep trading sideways.

2021-05-06 17:02:50,wallstreetbets,This is moronic. The volatility and the fact that it's valuation is unmoored from reality makes $GME investable.
2021-05-06 17:16:00,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face) could arrive over 200$??

It's funny, because it's true."
2021-05-06 15:48:31,wallstreetbets,"I had only a couple of them.

But this number is shock and awing.

But if it works, why not?"

2021-05-06 14:33:16,wallstreetbets,Can you tell me what the voting is for? I am a very novice college retard investor and I got the GME voting email a week ago but have no idea what to do with it
2021-05-06 12:30:26,wallstreetbets,Godspeed fellow retard. They will write stories about you in the future.
2021-05-06 14:53:47,wallstreetbets,"Respect. Fuck it, I'm liquidating other positions and upping the ante here."

What is this sub anymore? 😎"
2021-05-06 13:32:37,wallstreetbets,And already a wise man

2021-05-06 17:43:06,wallstreetbets,How do we kill one which has no life?
2021-05-06 12:54:43,wallstreetbets,Uhh.. I’ve gotta return some video tapes. 🏃🏻‍♂️💨
2021-05-06 12:10:12,wallstreetbets,Cost basis is around 630k but I kept averaging up since January
2021-05-06 16:34:48,wallstreetbets,True. Seems like turbulent times ahead. All in on GME (and a bit in properties).
2021-05-06 14:44:28,wallstreetbets,I don’t mind the wait to save 20% in taxes!
2021-05-06 17:26:34,wallstreetbets,\*2
2021-05-06 12:15:28,wallstreetbets,"If you know, you know."
2021-05-06 16:59:15,wallstreetbets,You haven't been?
2021-05-06 12:36:48,wallstreetbets,Wi Tu Lo
2021-05-06 12:38:21,wallstreetbets,"Check my post history, I’m there. But no ape left behind. 🦍 🦍 🦍"
2021-05-06 16:30:46,wallstreetbets,"A lot of new developments lately, but the negative volume and missing candles yesterday definitely got me jacked. New dtcc rules passed and go into effect in the next 10 days or so. Banks selling huge number of bonds to be cash heavy, Blackrock having the largest cash position they’ve ever had. Hedge funds selling stock across the whole market and institutions being the net sellers for weeks. Not to mention the mega wedge forming since January about to hit its breakout point. Lastly, another ftd wave about to hit (speculative). I feel like I’m almost out of time before we take off so I went all in."
2021-05-06 16:49:17,wallstreetbets,I’ve got GME in Webull too but not enough worth posting it 🙃
2021-05-06 16:37:17,wallstreetbets,"Eh I’ve been in it since December, can’t really speak to the GME posts popping up. But I don’t think interest waned. A lot of people migrated to other subs to post about it though."
2021-05-06 18:37:17,wallstreetbets,I’m sure retail owns the float. Retire my whole family and work on passion projects!
2021-05-06 18:34:32,wallstreetbets,I am jealous of your avg cost! I’d have a lot more shares if mine was that low. 🦍 💎 🙌🏼
2021-05-06 13:12:16,wallstreetbets,I LOVE the stock!
2021-05-06 15:42:58,wallstreetbets,How is it compromised
2021-05-06 13:32:14,wallstreetbets,"Without showing my account info, how do I post that shows it’s a real tda account? I’ll do it, just not sure how"
2021-05-06 17:15:02,wallstreetbets,All shorts must cover. Just a matter of time until they don’t have a choice.
2021-05-06 13:11:43,wallstreetbets,What’s an exit strategy?
2021-05-06 14:46:56,wallstreetbets,"I support amc apes as well, just not for me. My pops has some. I believe in GME regardless of the squeeze and management has shown us they’re on our side."
2021-05-06 16:22:58,wallstreetbets,I use TD ameritrade’s think or swim. Fidelity is also good but I don’t like their app.
2021-05-06 18:44:04,wallstreetbets,But that would limit my gains.. And IV is so low now it’s not worth it IMO. I did sell some cc’s to buy more shares when we had IV over 250%
2021-05-06 16:47:59,wallstreetbets,"I sold quite a lot in red positions.. I guess I’ll just call it “early tax loss harvesting” 😂. For me it’s a matter of opportunity cost, and right now none of my other positions gave the same asymmetric risk I see here."
2021-05-06 18:32:46,wallstreetbets,Once I figure out my final tax liabilities this week I’ll probably toss the rest of my cash that I put aside for taxes in.
2021-05-06 14:20:11,wallstreetbets,"yes you sir, we all are!"
2021-05-06 16:42:43,wallstreetbets,"Perfect, I’ll fit right in."
2021-05-06 13:11:27,wallstreetbets,"$250? What is this, a squeeze for ants?"
2021-05-06 14:18:03,wallstreetbets,Are you delusional? Do you suffer from a mental illness?

The costs are:

* Travel to location
* Hotel
* Living expenses while you are there
* Loss of money that you spent there instead of working. Or quality time

Some people manage to get a real kick out of these things. Because of corona-panic, they are at the moment virtual though.

If it is virtual, request an invitation. So you see for yourself.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"VIAC and other stocks option opinions (deleted someone tell me why this is being deleted)?  IMO it genuinely seems like MMs do not want these short term calls to make us anymore money. What is the work around? A little bit of patience.... but not really. If we all make our calls a year or two out, we don't have to worry about it expiring worthless...therefore the MMs lowering the price would have to be done year round and not just for our massive call expirations. Sure, we might not make AS much, but there will be no stopping us without the expired options dragging us down. So many lost shares due to the MM's manipulating that I think could be avoided. We know these stocks belong up, but so much of our money is tied into short term options they can easily beat us down. Would it be better for investors to just set long options and just keep buying stocks / long options if they tanked it?"
2021-05-06 13:05:40,wallstreetbets,VIAC is a buy
2021-05-06 17:54:06,wallstreetbets,"VAICA holder here. I think you are attributing too much influence to MMs. They cannot possibly manipulate such a large float to this extent. 

Problem is that price discovery was disrupted by the devinely inspired genius Bill Hwang and his leveraged buying. Add to it the dilution caused by the offering and nobody knows how to price this thing. Just be patient and go long stocks rather than calls (or at least leaps). It has a low P/E and decent dividend which makes it attractive in the current environment."

Their Q1 was just released and they are already up +16%. I don't think this is the end of the run. A number of milestones have been hit over the last few weeks and this is a good play right now. This is not a COVID play, but they do have one in the works. Or maybe you want to be a 🌈🐻, try puts and lose money. 

[Three key milestones](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biocryst-reports-first-quarter-2021-110000484.html).

* Q1 2021 ORLADEYO (berotralstat) net revenue of $10.9 million
* ORLADEYO now approved in U.S., Japan and EU
* BioCryst reaches agreement with FDA that change from baseline in hemoglobin is the primary endpoint for pivotal PNH trials of oral BCX9930 set to begin in second half of 2021

This is not financial advice. I really like the bio-tech and I've been sitting on 21x May 21 12c, and 55 Jun 18 25c for a few weeks. But what do I know, I've been a boomer trader until 2021."

Anyway, had a good laugh on your dd"
2021-05-06 15:28:28,wallstreetbets,"Road test caught on fire due to battery, not the truck. As for the engineering part I have a formal education as an aeronautical engineer. The hub motor cuts down on weight considerably by removing numerous heavy components and allows for more storage. Mechanically speaking the vehicle becomes less complicated and the result is a more efficient vehicle with fewer moving parts to repair. 

Yes, there will be greater stress, but this should be offset by the lack of maintenance required in other areas. The overall vehicle would theoretically last longer. Hard testing will be able to prove the longevity of the motors but since they have been used for decades we already have an idea that should work even with the added stress."
2021-05-06 12:35:10,wallstreetbets,They just have too much money for it to blow up
2021-05-06 12:33:03,wallstreetbets,LETS GOOOOOOO
2021-05-06 11:36:17,wallstreetbets,What have they done that has been shit? They only thing you could say is the pre orders and every EV does this. Tesla has claimed it has several hundred thousand “non binding” pre orders and no one cares.
2021-05-06 12:40:17,wallstreetbets,Up
2021-05-06 15:32:36,wallstreetbets,"Power to em on that front then. Still doesn't change the fact they have a sketchy ass CEO. I'd much rather put my money somewhere I trust than with that dude lol if you're betting them going up, I bid you good luck my mans, I'm not playing em either way. I just think it's gonna take a whole lot of good PR if they want to attract the general public again, which their current price point proves"

Edit: I at one point in time also thought they would go on to do great things, but holy fuck after all their shadiness came out I couldn't wait to ditch em"

2021-05-06 18:33:54,wallstreetbets,"Well, I have formal education as a mechanical engineer and I can tell you in-hub motors have been tried before and there's a reason why you don't see them on the road.

They are shit and will never outlast a ""regular"" EV truck."
2021-05-06 11:40:46,wallstreetbets,"They're a shady ass company, if I'm gonna go long and not look for a short play I'm going with pretty much any company that doesn't blatantly lie. Tesla had all kinds of shit going for it besides just the pre-orders, RIDE does not. They're not tesla lol"
2021-05-06 15:40:37,wallstreetbets,"Lots of stocks are getting rocked right now. Not worried about that at all. With preproduction plays you are making an educated gamble. If production happens you win big. If shit falls apart, you lose it all. The CEO is a good idea man but he should never talk. His timeless are far too aggressive and he uses words that can easily be used against him later. Betas were a big ask. With dozens of working trucks they can now test the hell out of it. If this is successful, production should be an easy next step. The market has been begging for an EV truck for years, so selling it won't be hard either. They just have to be first. So far nobody else is even close to beating them to it."
2021-05-06 13:28:44,wallstreetbets,They have a truck that works. Better than 99% of tower EV companies that went public since 2020 began with that alone.
2021-05-06 11:37:31,wallstreetbets,Nooooo
2021-05-06 18:41:10,wallstreetbets,The good news is that investors buying during pre-production really only need the concept to turn into a product. I would say that the other reason why this type of motor has not been used is because there is a lot more return on investment with replacement parts or gas fueled engines which is a major reason why the big manufacturers took so long to adapt.
2021-05-06 11:43:15,wallstreetbets,True.. I’m going to buy a put and take out tomorrow if I made anything. If I did I’ll buy 500 shares and a decent call
2021-05-06 19:51:09,wallstreetbets,"Back to your original point:

Battery is easily 60% of an EV (investment, power plant, weight, wear and tear risk, etc.) bad look having that go up in flames on a gentle test ride, why would I trust it in a collision @60+mph?

Not to discount your training and experience, but hub motor is akin to putting power plant and props at the wingtips on a plane: Dangles wayyy out there, increases stress on everything else, more prone to damage. Etc. As opposed to traditional power plant placement in the fuselage (body of a car).

And AWD requires 4 motors as opposed to
One with a transfer case and two transaxles or two like Tesla does.

More importantly these cats straight up lied and got friends to place interest orders (ie: “sure I might buy a few”) but billed it as real hard cash invested purchases (deposits) not to mention the constant (still ongoing?) design and engineering changes... those need to be dead nuts like months to a year before the first unit rolls off the line.

Overall this thing smells worse than a college student one semester “business plan” project. 

But it’s still listed! And ppl keep throwing their cash at it. While the price keeps dropping, and I’m just astounded at the basic stoopidity of the market as a whole 🤷🏾‍♀️

But you know :”fools and their money...”"
2021-05-06 12:13:23,wallstreetbets,I’m definitely retarded any suggestions on a put? 7.50 for tomorrow? Looking to buy one right now lol
2021-05-06 11:49:39,wallstreetbets,"That may be the move brother! Personally I won't touch em, infinitely too much bad press for my likings and all those around the CEO - Steve Burns - say he's a con man(I mean he even shares the last name ""Burns"" like ""Mr. Burns"" from the Simpsons, another red flag😂). Best of luck to ya my mans"
2021-05-06 19:59:18,wallstreetbets,"They are in pre production. They are building betas and testing. The fire was caused by human error... But again, pre production so that doesn't matter. I want fires. I want redesigns. I want failure. That's how you test things. You push them until they break. 

Only idiots believe a pre order is an actual order. That's just a shitty argument. I pre ordered a bronco but never once believed I bought a bronco. They could have one or a million orders and it doesn't matter because they are in pre production. Once they have a product ready for production that is when it all matters. 

You don't buy a company in this stage of development to be safe. You buy it for the possibility that it will make it to production and be first to market. If that happens, the price soars."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ABNB earnings coming up. Buy ABNB (w/ positions) https://preview.redd.it/5ksb7wu5pix61.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab7078b8199c807dc72f18a9bf66930c6483c509

Thesis/TLDR:  Buy ABNB.

AirBNB (ABNB) is undervalued and will bounce leading up to and beyond it's earnings date on 5/13/21.

Current Price: $153/shareMy Target Price: $185 by end of May

It is my intention to purchase additional calls if the price continues to drop leading up to earnings date.  I may also accumulate additional shares.

&#x200B;

ABNB and IPO'ed in December, hit a low of $122 shortly thereafter before finding a high of $219 on Feb 11th. It has trended downward since.

This is a heavily shorted stock with 22% short interest reported. Detractors believe the stock to be overpriced and will argue that the pandemic will continue to weigh on revenues and that the stock will see outsized competition from hotel groups other travel sites like VRBO. Regional legal challenges also remain a significant factor.

These issues noted, I believe this is a growth stock with it's best days ahead of it and the recent drop in price to be overdone. The whole thing reeks of manipulation to me. This is the ""go to"" vacation rental stock for so many areas and generally has a better reputation and much more momentum than it's competition. Larger trends and the pro/cons of airbnb aside, I believe that the earnings and guidance presented next week will set into motion what will be a relatively quick rise to $185 and beyond in weeks to follow."
2021-05-06 11:41:17,wallstreetbets,"I rent out my second bedroom on Airbnb.  When pandemic hit, I went from 95% occupancy to 0 literally overnight.  For months we had no bookings then last month it was like magic and I’m back to having to decline guests because I just want some alone time.  I’m in Los Angeles so maybe this is just because I’m in a hot spot for STRs but I’ve been making a lot of extra cash from this latest surge and I’ve just been rebuying stock with that."

2021-05-06 11:34:14,wallstreetbets,"Thanks but no thanks.  I live in Summit County Co where about 70% of homes are STRs.  They have destroyed affordable housing.  A room in a house here rents for over $2,000.  If you are lucky, you can find a room that you don’t have to share.  Local businesses have had enough with the labor shortages and having to buy housing for their employees and the local government is finally starting to restrict STRs.  I cannot imagine a scenario in which this does not play out in every resort town in America."

2021-05-06 11:47:41,wallstreetbets,I believe this to be key in why the legal challenges AirBNB is facing are likely to have limited results in most areas. Yes of course there will be restrictions on vacation rentals - there should be.  But the ability to rent rooms and houses on a short term basis has always existed and AirBNB adds structure to that. It brings a lot of money to individuals and regions and despite some back and forth many cities are having I believe when the dust settles AirBNB will have a huge presence.

Finally the stock broke that to get closer to a true value and multiple recently, but since this whole ""interest rate scare"" the shorts were able to gain control again to push it down and now absolutely raid it post earnings. This is an amazing company that makes sustainable molecules by fermenting sugar cane and has tons of growth ahead.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Flash Crash of 2010 // ARKK // The Ultimate Hedge Trophy The topic of Cathy Woods vs. the Hedges has been increasingly talked about over the last few days.  I'll argue that it's not being talked about enough.  

If you think GME is the biggest trophy prize for hedge funds, you are wrong.  It's ARK.  

Today is the anniversary of the Flash Crash of 2010.  It has everything to do with the market manipulation that we're seeing today, especially in small cap tech.  The actual time of the flash was 2:32, about 3 hours from now.  Look it up.  It's retail trading history, and it was a wealth grab in the trillions. 

Today is the turning point for many of Cathy's portfolios, and if ARKK loses support at 105.50, the entire sector is going to plummet.   ARKK will probably knife to 90.  The hedge funds will have one of their most profitable days in history.  

The Hedges want nothing more than for an embarrassed Cathy Woods to go on MSNBC tomorrow, fresh off one of the worst days of her professional life.  Regardless, she'll handle herself with dignity and grace, and in a way that no male CEO would have to do.  She's the face of more than just an ETF, and everyone knows it. 

Figure out if you love her or hate her another day- just go buy some ARK, and hold it.  

And bring a sleeping bag.."

Nope...pointing out shitty behavior isn't ""cancelling"" or demanding ""compliance"" -- if you feel threatened to that degree by an alternative point of view being expressed then that's on you! 

> I'm not even the one who said your sexist quote.

Exactly. But you did claim ""no sexism"" and when I showed you the sexism you made apologies for it.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC buying opportunity I'm sure most of you saw RKT crash and burn spectacularly yesterday. Its poor performance was largely responsible for UWMC dropping nearly 10% this morning. However, these companies experience opposite reactions to rising interest rates and shouldn't have moved together.

RKT primarily lends for refinancings. When rates go up as most investors expect, this business will suffer. RKT's management team repeatedly argued during their earnings call that they were trying to become a leading lender for home purchases, but they're not yet. UWMC is - very little of UWMC's business is refinance related, and there's enough unmet demand that rising interest rates are unlikely to halt the frantic homebuying market any time this year. 

UWMC also moved aggressively in the past quarter to shut RKT out of lenders it does business with. What portion of RKT's decreased earnings went to UWMC as a result?

UWMC stock is now at an all-time low, and calls that were ITM yesterday are a bargain.

2021-05-06 14:49:04,wallstreetbets,I'm $20k into UWMC so I'd love to see it climb again. Unfortunately it seems to run in sympathy with RKT for some ungodly reason
2021-05-06 12:01:35,wallstreetbets," Margin call today, sold Ford (F) but hold UWMC.

GLTA."
2021-05-06 11:36:24,wallstreetbets,"Lots of people buying over asking price on homes, yes it is great short term… but in 6 months when things cool off and they are way upside down on a house, refi may pick up or another housing bubble burst… only time will tell!"
2021-05-06 15:42:36,wallstreetbets,I just averaged down with 2800 more shares at $7.04. Talk about a steal!
2021-05-06 11:26:09,wallstreetbets,But shortage of homes for sale could crimp the frantic homebuying. Not sure what that means to these two. Just a thought
2021-05-06 12:14:15,wallstreetbets,waiting on the calls to fill now
2021-05-06 13:04:25,wallstreetbets,"finally got june 8c filled.

But overall its just plain dumb to dump the equity like this based on the report of the competitor. I swear this shit will pop tomorrow at least 5% just after market swallows all info and realizes its oversold"
2021-05-06 12:07:43,wallstreetbets,Got more today. Also thinking about converting my ASO gains into this.
2021-05-06 12:23:36,wallstreetbets,You son of a bitch..... I'm in.... 🚀 Retards
2021-05-06 13:54:25,wallstreetbets,How is UWM getting crushed more than rocket though. It's just wild.
2021-05-06 19:34:39,wallstreetbets,“UWMC stock is at an all-time low.” So far.
2021-05-06 13:07:35,wallstreetbets,Already in and holding@ 8.10
2021-05-06 13:43:05,wallstreetbets,"Got in just above 9, been selling other stocks and buying the dips. Down to 2370 shares at a $8.19 avg. Reserving my last bit to buy a potential further dip after ER. I've done a ton of individual research and the financials are just too good at this price point."
2021-05-06 14:08:31,wallstreetbets,Literally can’t go tits up
2021-05-06 15:03:09,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it, I like this and buying."
2021-05-06 16:35:09,wallstreetbets,Bought the dip. 100% of my holdings are UWMC now.
2021-05-06 18:59:28,wallstreetbets,When is earnings?
2021-05-06 13:01:46,wallstreetbets,Would love to  buy but I already used all my money to buy two months ago. Gg.
2021-05-06 18:46:11,wallstreetbets,WSB has fallen. Lol this shit actually says “DD” on it without any DD.
2021-05-06 19:14:59,wallstreetbets,"Stocks in this sector are all getting kicked in the nuts. RKT, LDI, PFSI.  UWMC will need something significant to see a move upwards.  Great buying opportunity now for the dividends in any case."
2021-05-06 13:37:53,wallstreetbets,RKT missed earnings by .01.  A freaking penny!!!  And this was AFTER earnings estimates had been bumped up several times.  The market acts like RKT said they were going to have .90 and came is at .10.
2021-05-06 14:18:26,wallstreetbets,To the moon 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-06 15:32:43,wallstreetbets,"if you look at RKT's press release, their broker volume actually went up from  $37.9B in Q4 to $40.7B in Q1, despite a broad decrease in overall mortgage origination. This means that RKT is actually taking UWMC's broker market share."
2021-05-06 12:58:55,wallstreetbets,Where's all the autist?
2021-05-06 13:50:50,wallstreetbets,This is the way....
2021-05-06 14:02:08,wallstreetbets,Sitting down 91% on my 5/21 $10 calls I bought in early April on similar DD.  Thought for a few it might claw back into the green two weeks back but the boosters done broke and she’s cratered hard.
2021-05-06 14:11:08,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
2021-05-06 15:02:30,wallstreetbets,"I like this, its a good counter rate hike play! Also we're just at the start of housing boom cycle, or perhaps the middle. I think there is a decent run up in housing trade volumes in the future which will boost financing demand."
2021-05-06 15:02:47,wallstreetbets,I can't read but you sound like you have at least a grade two reading level
2021-05-06 15:23:32,wallstreetbets,Should I cop some. I’m 15?
2021-05-06 15:52:43,wallstreetbets,"Bought at one of the previous all time lows, 9,xx, got out some time ago. Thank Dog!"
2021-05-06 16:30:39,wallstreetbets,If it goes lower company goes titz 🆙 I like the stock & play
2021-05-06 17:54:40,wallstreetbets,fake and gay
2021-05-06 18:29:35,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is I should buy some May calls tomorrow?
2021-05-06 19:14:11,wallstreetbets,I bought 5/21 calls today.
2021-05-06 15:28:47,wallstreetbets,"> nothing has happened that would fundamentally change this in the long term

Threats of rising rates? There really is. That said I have a UWMC long position so eh."
2021-05-06 18:17:37,wallstreetbets,"I feel this.  Only 1000 shares, but yeah."
2021-05-06 14:53:24,wallstreetbets,"UWMC can't go lower from all time low with earnings beat..

If it goes lower temporarily, you can lower average cost and perhaps get 6% div.

Last QUARTER after tax NI was $1B. Current market cap $12B.

6% div yield can give you diamond hands"
2021-05-06 12:45:40,wallstreetbets,The VIAC bust is so bizarre. It was already hovering below fair value. Even analysts with neutral to sell ratings suggest 15% upside.
2021-05-06 14:24:17,wallstreetbets,Do you think everyone's done selling from archegos blow up. People bought in at 50 right after thinking they were getting a deal lol.
2021-05-06 15:10:15,wallstreetbets,I'm literally retarded and this sounds like a great idea
2021-05-06 14:16:09,wallstreetbets,"People don't understand the ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" philosophy on this sub. Institutional owners, funds, etc see good earnings as an exit point. That way the buying pressure can allow then to unravel large positions without tanking the stock price too hard."
2021-05-06 15:45:00,wallstreetbets,And that was basically caused by Russell.
2021-05-06 11:43:14,wallstreetbets,"I think it depends on how quickly the market cools. Lending standards for individuals have remained high this time around, so we're unlikely to see a sudden wave of people failing to make payments. I think it's more likely that interest gradually returns to normal levels over the next 6-12 months while inventory also gradually re-enters the market. With a slow shift, the current bids over asking will establish a new appraisal level and buyers won't be underwater."
2021-05-06 13:06:36,wallstreetbets,"IDK, have lots of friends looking to buy homes (anecdotal I know) who keep swearing (it's been like 8-9 years now) that the market will cool-off and they will get a great deal when that happens. They are all still in their apartments and now priced out.

With Google proving that WFH saves a boat load on costs(1b+ last year), and the never ending pandemic (covid is likely endemic and never going away), I really don't see any cool-off coming. Maybe a level off at some point."
2021-05-06 11:36:15,wallstreetbets,"More demand for housing than supply is an excellent problem to have, especially long-term."
2021-05-06 11:28:30,wallstreetbets,Naw gonna be a lot of defaults
2021-05-06 13:17:36,wallstreetbets,  It has to do with the margins on the loans. RKT and UWMC don't hold these loans they sell them to Fannie may and Freddie Mac RKT reported going from. 4.4 in fourth quarter to 2.4 first quarter. This will affect uwmc aswell
2021-05-06 15:16:36,wallstreetbets,"But is it?  Rocket has multiple different revenue streams whereas UWMC has mortgages.   Additionally, Rocket reporting lower earnings on the mortgage side which will translate to UWMC as well.  Since that is all UWMC does, it will hurt them **MORE** than RKT."
2021-05-06 16:40:23,wallstreetbets,"Brother, if you think earnings are going to make it go down, I’ve got a bridge to sell you."
2021-05-06 19:03:36,wallstreetbets,Monday AH
2021-05-06 13:13:24,wallstreetbets,"Next time it rises set a stop loss a bit above your buy in price, and steel yourself to wait for  a big dip!"
2021-05-06 16:08:16,wallstreetbets,It was actually due to volume increase and not increase in market share. Also fast quarter represents majority of time before ultimatum. UWMCs numbers should reflect strong growth there.
2021-05-06 16:37:18,wallstreetbets,Just got $10 calls for January on this DD. I don’t think the market is cooling off any time soon and once people are able to build houses again (a thing that should happen this year) the stock should be able to go back up. I’m pulling this out of my ass and is not financial advice.
2021-05-06 18:33:57,wallstreetbets,That's what I did this morning.
2021-05-06 15:41:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes but at this price point, the market is pricing the stock like it'd have no dividend for the next 4-6 years at all. I genuinely don't understand the person who sold to me today. The best explanation I've heard was that it's a combination of SPAC fatigue, interest rate action and issues that their competitors have had, but none of these is really UWMC's fault."
2021-05-06 16:22:22,wallstreetbets,"VIAC is following the AMD model of blowing out earnings but having their stock price get hammered.

2021-05-06 14:53:33,wallstreetbets,"Are you talking about me, sir?"
2021-05-06 14:54:17,wallstreetbets,People don't understand the randomness. It goes up or down. Or sideways.
2021-05-06 11:50:21,wallstreetbets,"Those are valid points. Nowhere near 2008 housing market. But the unknown factor in this as most things nowadays, it the pandemic. If everything here in the US starts to get back to the “New” normal it should cool off slowly, especially since a lot of big companies are going with a more hybrid WFH approach. In the company I work for, a few of our upper management have purchased homes in other states and intend to work from there and only be back in the office as needed or required. 80% of are sales and marketing teams will stay WFH to reduce the office space. So, there should be a good number of people buying and keeping homes. I own 20 of both RKT and UWMC. So I am tossing popcorn from the cheap seats!"
2021-05-06 13:18:07,wallstreetbets,"WFH is the “New” normal. I was lucky and bought the dip in the housing market, got my house back in 2012, just before things picked up. Got a steal on a foreclosure short sale. Timing is everything."
2021-05-06 12:28:34,wallstreetbets,"Oh agree, unless you want to buy one"
2021-05-06 12:51:41,wallstreetbets,Negative. If their is a shortage of homes they can be picky about who they give loans too.
2021-05-06 15:36:09,wallstreetbets,it's 4.41 in Q4 and 3.74 in Q1
2021-05-06 17:01:50,wallstreetbets,"Good chance that price could drop after earnings, multiple successful reports this quarter where prices have dropped afterwards. I'm more than cool with it going up after earnings.🚀"
2021-05-06 16:42:05,wallstreetbets,"Also their partner channel isn’t just wholesale so their cushioned and the people who stayed invariably gave them more volume as a result. 7 percent is really, really nothing. They didn’t give guidance for q2 for the partner channel so..."

2021-05-06 19:08:02,wallstreetbets,Chart looks goddamn awful
2021-05-06 12:59:49,wallstreetbets,"I think I have a good idea of who it is. I suspected last year a certain family was  buying property under the radar.  I also think they lobbied states to limit licenses, which they ended up obtaining.  The  company is publicly traded, but I fear once legalization happens, they will privatize it. The rich that profited from keeping cannibas illegal, would than have a monopoly.  

If the average person isn't able to compete, than it should be legal for anyone to grow."
2021-05-06 11:18:14,wallstreetbets,Colorado had more cannabis sales than all of Canada. US market is massive. This rocket will take off
2021-05-06 12:13:32,wallstreetbets,I'm actually pretty hopeful with High Tide. They're a solid Canadian company that is making inroads into the US expansion of legalization.
2021-05-06 13:32:30,wallstreetbets,"CURLF = CuraleaF. It is one of the largest US cannabis companies, currently listed on the Canadian stock exchange (OTC), because it is still illegal in the US. It will eventually be uplisted to the NYSE.

2021-05-06 11:30:35,wallstreetbets,Keep an eye out for Q1 2021 sales for US cannabis next week. These companies are growing quickly
2021-05-06 12:53:58,wallstreetbets,Interesting. I only somewhat recently started following them and saw they're getting into the e-commerce side of things and acquired some other Canadian stores. It's my only non-US weed stock so we'll see.
2021-05-06 14:13:59,wallstreetbets,No problem comrade! We are all on the same page and just want to make a shit load of money.  This is my next big bet

2021-05-06 11:30:37,wallstreetbets,I got out this morning. My $0.40 $35C went over $3 and I cashed out lol. Everyone knows this stock is worth $50-75 (including ASO itself who is buying 20% of the secondary offering and not selling any shares). Will see where it settles before jumping back in.
2021-05-06 11:11:34,wallstreetbets,Nice

KKR is doing the offering to pay back investors...

2021-05-06 17:34:47,wallstreetbets,I sold close to the ATH and got right back I’m before close.
2021-05-06 12:59:48,wallstreetbets,New to the sub. Why buy when KKR is consistently going up and 5x more expensive than in the last 10 years?
2021-05-06 17:35:34,wallstreetbets,Did you see the volume spike right at close? Almost 46m worth. Wonder what that’ll do for the price tomorrow
2021-05-06 17:40:57,wallstreetbets,"Not too worried about it. I bought back in right before close. Will see if a new channel forms and will buy the dips, they will crush their earnings again. I suspect it will hover in the $34-36.50 range until the next leg up."
2021-05-06 17:42:24,wallstreetbets,"Right on very cool. I did the same, took profit during the run up and got in right before close."

2021-05-06 12:20:50,wallstreetbets,"Oh fuck off. No one has been at odds with the mods more than me. No one is compromised. I used to be a mod. ALL the conversations were around how to allow as much free speech as possible without incurring the wrath of Reddit admins/regulators. Dudes like u/zjz go out of their way to help manage the insane traffic of this sub for free. 

No one has more reason to hate mods than me. I make content for the retards of this sub and constantly have to waste my time after my stuff gets deleted. But they're not shills. They're doing their best managing a meme-sub dedicated to securities. It's super fucked that you guys are insinuating that they're taking money. Totally off the mark."

2021-05-06 17:52:27,wallstreetbets,"The people betting against AMC/ GME are Billionaires people. Do you really think that they were just going to 'Pay Up' and start their new lives as homeless people? No. If YOU or I was a Billionaire and we had a 5 Billion Dollar Bill coming up, would we be eager to pay it and go completely broke? Or would we go kicking and screaming to the bitter end? I don't know about you guys, but I would wait until the cops kicked in my door and forced me to pay. So will the hedge funds. They are going to use whatever tool they can to keep their fortunes and if that means planting BOTS and paying off Youtube Influencers to get us to sell, don't be so surprised. I would advise that people STOP reading Reddit post and STOP watching the stock news. Just hold and live your lives. When the squeeze happens you will know. When AMC hits $ 1,000 and GME rockets, you will hear about it. At THAT point you should pay attention. But until then, just HOLD and ignore the noise."

It would appear that the bot that has taken over your account is unaware of what the copyright infringement actually is.  You should make sure it is programmed a little better in the future, as there is no possible justification for pretending a video clip that was clearly altered to have the meaning changed is copyright infringement.  Copyright laws were actually written in order to promote the very activity that OP engaged in.

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

Been subbed since like 2017 and this is the worst state I've ever seen it in. Mods are doing an amazing job but the fact that this sub went from 2m to 10m subscribers in a few months kind of limits what they can do, considering they're such a small team doing it for free."

It was actually pretty great, it came with a script-able level editor and robust multiplayer back before there was a true 3d rendering engine.

Bonus trivia: the building in the first level of the game is modeled on IDs (creators of Doom) headquarters. At the end of the level the building is destroyed by an earthquake and Duke says ""I ain't afraid of no quake."" This is a reference to the next game ID was developing, Quake."

They didn’t really try to mind-fuck people with Inception-like plot twists as much back then (especially with a $3 million budget), however the series may be expanding. The person who produced They Live teased two more sequels “They Laugh” and “They Love” earlier this year iirc. Seeing as how Nada, the protagonist dies but successfully knocks out the transmission, if a sequel is made it will be from the perspective of a new protagonist.

It would be interesting to see how a concept like this would do with 2021 film production quality, and it getting made doesn’t seem *too* unlikely due to how it’s reception changed to a much more positive tone throughout the decades."

2021-05-06 18:26:40,wallstreetbets,"So legit question. How does switching account reminds you of being ''kinder''. Do you read your username before you post/comment something?

Also where is the line of ''conspiracy theory'' for you? I think that you would agree that the biggest conglomerates spend 100s of millions dollars for lobbying power and ''donations'' towards politicians.

So don't you think that spending just a bunch of 100s of thousands dollars or even 1 or 2 million (still change money for them) to influence the (arguably) main source of information for retail investors would be more than likely?

Are you so damn brainwashed to not even consider that possibility? Or is it all ''CoNsPiraCy ThE0oRy'' since you did not see it on CNBC?

My position would be : we don't know to what extent but it's most likely happening.

I've been using PMCC strategy on AAPL and collecting 150 USD in premiums with far OTM options each week while stock is in the same price range since August seemed good at first, however lately I realized that I might be just doing a zero-sum game...

I've been collecting premiums for a few months until AAPL popped 13% in 9 days. Although I had to roll my call options with a loss of 600 USD I still had a positive delta and made some unrlz gains. 

Now AAPL stock felt down to its corridor where it's been since August and my long-term options have \~0$ of unrlz profit while I have realized a 600 USD loss which almost equals all premiums I've collected so far.

Am I doing something wrong or is it just AAPL that is fucking me over which is fluctuating in it's price range but still takes away my premiums with a quick pop-up."

Doesn't make them tasty."
2021-05-06 16:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Sure if you include long term assets in the net debt calculation. But for most solvency ratio calculations usually Net Debt = Long Term Debt + Short Term Debt - Current Assets. Then you compare that to the firms ability to pay off the debt with something like a Net Debt/EBITDA ratio.

AMC isn't forecasted to return to positive EBITDA until 2022, with $0.52B and then $0.74M in 2023. Using those EBITDA forecasts and the current Net Debt of $10.70B you get Net Debt/EBITDA of 20x in 2022 and 14.5x in 2023. That's pretty hard to pay your way out of. Most debt covenants I've come across stipulate no more than a 3.5 ratio. But of course exceptions can be made by the lenders if you have a lot of assets like AMC."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why AYX is a Hidden GEM I have been trading for a decade and I consider myself very conservative when it comes to investing. I only invest in companies that has potential and a potential acquisition target based on their product. 

Here I am writing about AYX. I, myself, have used Alteryx at work and I will be honest, it's one of the best analytic tools to manipulate large number of data. I have used Tableau and other tools but the speed and the simple tools from AYX makes is user friendly for folks with no SQL background.

Their numbers speaks truth. ARR growing at 20% YoY and with this rate, they should be reaching $650-$685M ARR by end of 2021. Very excited for their GLOBAL analytics conference coming this May 18-21 where tens of thousands of people will be joining the virtual conference to showcase their products and the new cloudbased feasability.

Currently, it has a market cap of $5B and holds $1B in cash with no intentions to dilute. 

Very low float. 58M shares.

Shares shorted. 4.1M shares or 7% of float.

A good target for an acquisition. (Tableau was bought for $15.7 Billion in 2019 with an ARR of $1Billion.

Based on that, i know Alteryx is much powerful product than Tableau and should worth 10B today or shared price of $120-$130 range. I am not licensed or this is not my full time job but you do your own DD to make sure you are investing your money in something that has truly potential. Not like stocks thats being traded in HOPE and HYPE. I always look at the health of their balance sheet as it's their number one sign of dilution."

2021-05-06 11:08:21,wallstreetbets,"AYX gets easily manipulated with low volume. It's not for the impatient trader. YOu have to look at long term and remove stop loss. Let it sink, average down and cash out rich!"
2021-05-06 11:14:20,wallstreetbets,Long ayx not worried that it’s down rn holding forever
2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"500k Going into UWMC Earnings Have been slowly accumulating shares since UWMC started trending in early March. If you've experienced it, the independent broker channel is such a better customer experience than working with a giant mortgage company. 

I do need the money, so the 6P is my comfort insurance. It was cheaper before RKT drilled into the Earth's core.

2021-05-06 11:10:16,wallstreetbets,Should be another good dip after earnings that you can buy in to.
2021-05-06 11:00:17,wallstreetbets,crazy! that;s all i can say
2021-05-06 10:54:27,wallstreetbets,Good luck to us 🙏
2021-05-06 11:14:15,wallstreetbets,I'm holding a bag too and just bought more this morning on discount day.
2021-05-06 11:16:52,wallstreetbets,At least you hedged good luck
2021-05-06 12:55:31,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-06 13:39:22,wallstreetbets,RKT 2.0
2021-05-06 11:22:09,wallstreetbets,Sure just like everyone at rocket....... it’s not gonna spike
2021-05-06 16:51:39,wallstreetbets,Earnings plays have been even more risky of late
2021-05-06 14:58:21,wallstreetbets,Your post history is limited to UWMC. How much do they pay you
2021-05-06 12:37:48,wallstreetbets,Good day for bying more🤩
2021-05-06 12:45:37,wallstreetbets,"Question. If earnings is always either a dip or an increase, wouldn't it be smart to buy a spread? So unless it trades sideways on earnings, you make money 100% just not as much. I'm retarded so help me out."
2021-05-06 12:48:51,wallstreetbets,"Im over earnings yolo
Ill never get back the last 4 things hyped."
2021-05-06 11:02:43,wallstreetbets,[removed]

2021-05-06 15:08:08,wallstreetbets,it's not like we should've learned anything from $RKT this morning

2021-05-06 13:39:47,wallstreetbets,"I’ve got a little of this garbage stock, but everyone who’s commented on working with them have all said that they are a complete shitshow."
2021-05-06 14:45:23,wallstreetbets,RKT 2.0 SP1
2021-05-06 11:24:52,wallstreetbets,UWMC has lower expectations for it since it's a fraction of the market cap.
2021-05-06 15:47:35,wallstreetbets,Have lurked WSB for years but GME finally made me make a reddit account. Made 500k from GME calls and looking for the next thing.
2021-05-06 18:42:39,wallstreetbets,This gatekeeping of WSB grows tiresome. Stocks other than GME exist. A YOLO is what makes this sub.
2021-05-06 15:43:21,wallstreetbets,Earnings are priced in to the premium so this strategy can work but only if the earnings are a large surprise. If earnings barely miss or are slightly above expectations the stock will react (maybe who knows in this market) in a way that isn’t very large resulting in the spreads losing significant value. Implied volatility is typically higher than actual volatility and your strategy would rely on the opposite being true
2021-05-06 11:06:57,wallstreetbets,Therapy and confirmation bias
2021-05-06 14:08:32,wallstreetbets,"Not sure that counts as a bet, but smart you are"
2021-05-06 15:15:33,wallstreetbets,Or $UWMC dropping almost 10%
2021-05-06 14:31:05,wallstreetbets,Sounds like good stock to go all in on calls
2021-05-06 12:08:08,wallstreetbets,"Three of my investments where profitable and beat earnings, Stock price plummeted. One stock missed and still went up. This is an ass market."
2021-05-06 14:50:54,wallstreetbets,It’s not really smart. It’s just saying I want money leftover even if it’s stupid.
2021-05-06 15:22:32,wallstreetbets,"Here's the difference, UWMC earns almost 10% per share per quarter, RKT was at about 3%.  That's nearly a 40% earning per share annually compared to 12%.  UWMC needs to be at about $12.50 to be where RKT is right now, or RKT needs to fall to like $14 to be where UWMC is."
2021-05-06 12:16:52,wallstreetbets,"Totally. If it moves, best to have shares because the action is in pre/post market. IMO calls are a scam right now."
2021-05-06 15:52:09,wallstreetbets,The shares are using low interest margin. Better than calls because of active hours volatility
2021-05-06 17:41:07,wallstreetbets,"Will buy if price to book drops below 1, expect that to happen very soon."
2021-05-06 12:42:00,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion, the whole market seems like a scam, the movement in every way seems gross or off balance"
2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Schwab gently suggests maybe options trading isn’t for me(-$327K)... crushed an otherwise great year

2021-05-06 12:00:28,wallstreetbets,love how they throw salt on the wound by reminding you how much you paid them in commisions.
2021-05-06 14:08:02,wallstreetbets,It’s be funny if they said “you paid $1000 in commissions (thanks BTW)”
2021-05-06 15:27:55,wallstreetbets,Christ I’m surprised that they didn’t send it pre-stamped in case you managed to fuck that up too.
2021-05-06 16:18:07,wallstreetbets,When you are so retarded the brokerage has to send you a letter😄
2021-05-06 12:20:57,wallstreetbets,"You lost $290,000 thousand already and they are warning you about losing the last $37,000:…."

2021-05-06 11:09:22,wallstreetbets,That 5% annual increase with a roboviser isn't looking too shabby now huh?

2021-05-06 11:37:08,wallstreetbets,i want you to know that there's someone out there (me) that loves you and is proud of you
2021-05-06 15:09:24,wallstreetbets,"Did they presume that you considered yourself an ""I/We""? That type of intentional disrespect is worth at least $327,647. & yes, reply in crayon."
2021-05-06 12:00:07,wallstreetbets,"Awww Schwab’s so gentle, trying not to startle you. You may be the first retard they have seen in the wild."
2021-05-06 12:17:19,wallstreetbets,Fucking legend dude
2021-05-06 12:21:31,wallstreetbets,They have so little faith in you that they're asking you to confirm you understand TWICE.

2. Make it clear to Schwab that you are mentally handicapped and do not understand what you are doing

3. Sue them for taking advantage of someone who CLEARLY does not have the mental capacity for options trading

4. You now own Schwab, YOLO it all on PLTR weeklies"
2021-05-06 11:18:52,wallstreetbets,"So based on that review, they need you to understand the risks... so much so that they told yky the exact same line twice in case you missed it the first time 🤣"

2021-05-06 17:04:15,wallstreetbets,"Dude, at least get them to lower your commissions. I feel left out that Schwab hasn't sent me one of these. Granted, I'm still moderately profitable YTD."
2021-05-06 17:07:32,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, sign in crayon, and I'll add that you should sign with only an ""X"". 😂😎"

2021-05-06 17:18:41,wallstreetbets,Investing can be counter intuitive. Figure out what you should do and do the opposite. You’ll be fine.
2021-05-06 17:26:57,wallstreetbets,Name checks out

2021-05-06 18:04:27,wallstreetbets,But did you buy the dip though?
2021-05-06 18:06:05,wallstreetbets,I honestly wonder if they sent these out prior to GME?

2021-05-06 18:28:50,wallstreetbets,Obviously they have not done a thorough review to see the big picture ;)
2021-05-06 18:29:01,wallstreetbets,They wonder why so many ppl zombie walked to Robinhood and readily crashed and burned... Just let me crash and burn in peace!😂😂💀

2021-05-06 18:41:53,wallstreetbets,"What rate of return are we talking here, and can you adopt me?  It’s ok if it’s a Gaetz-style adoption"

2021-05-06 19:10:36,wallstreetbets,Now that your horses have departed be advised that leaving the barn door open carries certain risks.
2021-05-06 19:36:16,wallstreetbets,"They asked if you understand four times, one sentence repeats itself.  I think they think you don't understand what you are doing man."
2021-05-06 19:40:31,wallstreetbets,Bro they fucking said it TWICE.  LOL
2021-05-06 19:54:07,wallstreetbets,Playing with fire.
2021-05-06 19:56:38,wallstreetbets,"This is standard letter. Compliance forces sales people to mail this kind of letter to customers to make sure they can continue to milk commissions out of an active account without the risk of being sued by the ape that owns it. 

You may consider closing your option account, get whatever is left and buy a Wendy's franchise. We will all be your customer.  
😎🤜"
2021-05-06 19:57:48,wallstreetbets,Ask for a refund
2021-05-06 19:59:44,wallstreetbets,"What does it repeat the sentence “based on this review, we need you to confirm you understand the potential risks of options trading” twice. It’s not like you can read in the first place."

2021-05-06 12:33:51,wallstreetbets,Most eloquent way to be called Retarded . Gratz man
2021-05-06 12:38:49,wallstreetbets,You just need to let them know that you are an ardent follower of r/wallstreetbets and then they will hire and promote you upon proof that you have changed your name to Charles Schwab Jr. the IV.
2021-05-06 12:39:36,wallstreetbets,"Ouch!  
Me losing 1K not so bad for the year"
2021-05-06 12:39:47,wallstreetbets,Are y’all like millionaires or some shit? How do you lose that much money. You’ve gotta be killing it elsewhere.
2021-05-06 12:40:08,wallstreetbets,From $365k to $37k. Holy fuck! I am starting to agree we need protection from ourselves.
2021-05-06 12:54:41,wallstreetbets,They repeat a sentence in the third paragraph.  Looks like they are the ones who should be reviewing their own work first.
2021-05-06 12:54:55,wallstreetbets,"Got to Rlly Agtree with the 3rd year old letter..LMAO they would feel the need to help or risk some ""leaked"" media of just what happened..lol"

2021-05-06 14:59:47,wallstreetbets,the chart says your up $222.7K over a 6 month period tho
2021-05-06 15:14:10,wallstreetbets,"So, did you sent it back?

And please do not include a banana. They do not know what to make of it. :)"
2021-05-06 15:21:19,wallstreetbets,They just don’t want to be liable just in case you jump in front of a train.
2021-05-06 15:26:39,wallstreetbets,"Don't let your mom find out about the letter, she'll take away  your allowance money."
2021-05-06 16:12:24,wallstreetbets,"I wish I could afford to lose over $300,000"
2021-05-06 16:28:49,wallstreetbets,You only have one more day to get it back to them.

2021-05-06 17:04:47,wallstreetbets,Are you selling I keep losing more and more everyday too ..not as much as you though!!
2021-05-06 17:07:22,wallstreetbets, What an expensive letter
2021-05-06 17:10:13,wallstreetbets,They are investigating kraken for capital gains tax on everyone not just the rich protect your investments investigate capital gains they are taking the 99% hard earned investment not just the 1%

2021-05-06 17:41:59,wallstreetbets,"Schwab didn’t do that in the past, guess they’ve gone soft"
2021-05-06 17:45:23,wallstreetbets,Maybe training wheels are indicated for the bicycle.
2021-05-06 17:45:50,wallstreetbets,Wish i had that $$$$ to risk ! I can play options nicely!!
2021-05-06 17:53:44,wallstreetbets,If you are a billionaire then Schwab is wrong.
2021-05-06 17:56:15,wallstreetbets,"If they were going to send out letters like that, why not send them to customers who lost only half their money?"
2021-05-06 17:58:52,wallstreetbets,That’s how mine looks on a smaller scale... are they saying that something is wrong?
2021-05-06 18:01:26,wallstreetbets,Am I missing something? Looks like you are up 200k in the last 6 months?
2021-05-06 18:07:58,wallstreetbets,Oh its beautiful
2021-05-06 18:18:59,wallstreetbets,"Call them up and lie that you thought you were buying stocks, not options. They might refund some of your money!"
2021-05-06 18:19:46,wallstreetbets,"That's not a gentle suggestion btw. At least you can take this kind of bath, most clients at Schwab don't have the means to take on that level of risk. 

Also, the brokers do laugh at you after the call especially when you can't beat money market account returns."
2021-05-06 18:29:35,wallstreetbets,I highly recommend you get some serious Options training. I have told Options on and off for several years. There’s some concept you’re not grasping.
2021-05-06 18:32:16,wallstreetbets,Why do they think you can read
2021-05-06 18:33:28,wallstreetbets,I like the crayon idea.

2021-05-06 19:40:37,wallstreetbets,Yea and they are absorbing TDAMERITRADE 🤦‍♀️
2021-05-06 19:44:36,wallstreetbets,Is doubling down an option?

2021-05-06 11:24:20,wallstreetbets,"In fairness I didn’t even catch that the first time reading it, so they nailed it"
2021-05-06 12:36:58,wallstreetbets,Write back and tell them you need them to understand the risks of cut-and-paste letter writing.
2021-05-06 12:22:38,wallstreetbets,"And then the next sentence after *that* is: ""We want to be sure you understand the potential risks of options trading."" 😂"
2021-05-06 15:37:53,wallstreetbets,I legit thought I missed a line and that I doubled back 🤣

2021-05-06 14:08:37,wallstreetbets,"They probably do think he is slow, to be fair."
2021-05-06 19:52:26,wallstreetbets,Came here for this.
2021-05-06 16:10:41,wallstreetbets,Just trace your hand with the crayon.
2021-05-06 12:31:32,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
2021-05-06 14:20:05,wallstreetbets,Nothing like filling paperwork and getting a snack afterwards
2021-05-06 14:16:22,wallstreetbets,With hastily scribbled DD on the back also in crayon and some wendy’s burger grease stains for character.
2021-05-06 12:42:53,wallstreetbets,I legitimately think that if it's signed with a crayon they will consider it invalid because it's not in ink and they will fire their client as somehow being a potential liability.
2021-05-06 17:34:02,wallstreetbets,I just laughed so hard I woke up my wife's husband
2021-05-06 16:28:06,wallstreetbets,"With a crayon, with your foot. Like a true ape."
2021-05-06 16:58:49,wallstreetbets,I am dead 🤣

2021-05-06 19:14:25,wallstreetbets,They put the last sentence of paragraph 2 in twice. Right next to one another. I’m surprised this letter wasn’t written in crayon.

2021-05-06 13:07:28,wallstreetbets,Comedy aside it really is reflective of their integrity. It's just hilarious the way the letter reads
2021-05-06 18:19:57,wallstreetbets,"I've heard of certain casino's doing the same thing, weirdly. An acquintance of mine actually got banned from his casino because he was losing too much in too little time."

2021-05-06 13:20:48,wallstreetbets,Agreed!
2021-05-06 13:24:39,wallstreetbets,By starting with 800K
2021-05-06 13:27:16,wallstreetbets,P.s thx for remand why I'm not playing options
2021-05-06 15:18:41,wallstreetbets,"1K is cheap.

You dont want to know the fees I paid."
2021-05-06 15:21:07,wallstreetbets,"You dont?

Commissions are fair game when dealing with at least half pros, I would think.

You pay peanuts....or bananas... :)"
2021-05-06 14:42:44,wallstreetbets,I wish this were true but I started with $110K fully invested mid November and account is sitting around $350K today

2021-05-06 16:28:22,wallstreetbets,Actually I take that back. If I was a rich kid posting loss porn on Reddit that means I’d probably be a miserable cunt that thought I was better than “the poors.” I wouldn’t want to be that.
2021-05-06 18:46:12,wallstreetbets,NGL I probably wouldn’t have posted a straight $327K loss.

2021-05-06 13:27:26,wallstreetbets,Ok so these weren’t way OTM yolos but trading sideways crushed them. These were bought around peak IV so they were really expensive to begin with. And I kept rolling them closer to the money and reducing the quantity. I don’t remember dates or strike prices but if the GME was trading at 225 let’s say I’d probably be buying 200-250 strikes... and with the price crashing it just tanked the value of them.
2021-05-06 14:41:11,wallstreetbets,Started with $110K currently sitting around $350K
2021-05-06 14:44:41,wallstreetbets,It’s $.65 per contract IIRC

2021-05-06 14:56:38,wallstreetbets,Gained and lost with GME and a biotech that I can’t mention due to WSB rules

2021-05-06 14:23:16,wallstreetbets,"FYI, this is actually a legal CYA letter they send to prevent you from later suing them for improperly allowing you to absorb this big a loss without shutting you off sooner. The more times they write “you need to certify you understand the risks of options” the easier they can sleep at night knowing you won’t sue claiming “I never understood the risks!”

This isn’t legal advice, but you may wish to talk to an attorney before you sign that."

2021-05-06 18:32:22,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure letting an option expire worthless counts as realizing a loss.
2021-05-06 16:54:30,wallstreetbets,Civil liability lasts 7 years. Just need to sue your broker in federal court. If it is under a certain amount it is cheaper to settle than sending a lawyer to court.

2021-05-06 16:51:47,wallstreetbets,I would think not paying commissions is better than paying commissions. Does your broker call you up and tell you how good you look before taking the position?

I might be wrong, but fidelity also sends these letters in my humble opinion.

2021-05-06 14:47:55,wallstreetbets,to be fair he should never sue them for his options losses to begin with so signing this should have no bearing on anything

2021-05-06 12:47:38,wallstreetbets,I think losing a little on options so I can win big on other investments is exactly what options are for... if I wasn't a retard.

I’m just saying I spent years defending big wall st banks against private litigation and lawsuits where investors claimed they were unarmed of the risks they were taking, or that investments were unsuitable, or that they weren’t properly warned they could lose their entire position, etc...

Granted the clients suing were usually pretty sophisticated individuals with $5m-$1b+ net worth. But they operate in a “heads I win, tails you lose” manner. And they can be successful at the suits sometimes. 

Most retail customers have no clue about the rights they may have when they sustain large losses. They just take it on the chin and move on. 

But yeah, seems like OP had eyes wide open and is fine with the losses."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"An argument for transparency of positions as a tool for change in markets Hello all  
This is not financial advise.  


Thank you to  [u/Goldendust](https://www.reddit.com/u/Goldendust/) for the amazing work they have done. I was able to make the following based on those 472 observations combined with my own 152 observations.

I have made a probability calculation of ownership just to give an illustration of what possible scenarios could be.   


Basically: Retail owns the float IMO.  
Warning: Math incoming  


The calculations go as follows.  
Engagement on the stock is 10 million because WSB membership sets this bar.  
I then estimate based on NO data other than personal sentiment that around 35% of engaged people hold onto the stock. So that gives us a maximum of 3.5 million active traders. This will be the premise for the following.  


The 624 total observations made by u/Goldendust \+ My own found average shares of people posting on YOLO updates or positions in GME to be around 664 shares held.  
Thats a high number (no DFV is not part of this data. I removed his 200k shares is i think they disrupt the average too much). So we are using it as the absolute maximum number of shares held in the most extreme scenario.  


So The following table shows on the y-axis:   


  


[Number of average shares in each scenario. I have applied a 5&#37; scaledown factor.](https://preview.redd.it/tbjfnq7odix61.png?width=77&format=png&auto=webp&s=44aa47283be1323b159fd37848523149b5fa9223)

&#x200B;

On the x axis 

&#x200B;

[X axis shows how many people of the total 3.5 million established maximum is holding in each scenario.](https://preview.redd.it/o8a2tsl0eix61.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ce6ecff44696b9091e4f6abc2cc50e1c7de286f)

  
So for instance   
the most extreme scenario of shares held is 664 shares held by all 3.5 million people or   
664 \* 3500000 = 2,324,000,000 shares held by retail investors.  


The most extreme scenario of not held i 0 people engaged and 0 shares held so 0.   


Now both these are very unlikely but they are used to built the following table.  


So the table shows us what the amount of shares held in each scenario would be.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wojg058deix61.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=57242a65219566d61314a5c0f411aef7228ce82d

  
All the red cells show scenarios of retail owning Less than 46,000,000 shares which is the float.  


All the yellow cells show scenarios where retail owns equal to or less than the Float x2.  


All the green cells show scenarios where retail owns equal or more than Float x3.  


Then we examine how those scenarios come out in data.  


&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kwdsxb4feix61.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea374911242cb55de69e6218f6745a964337357

  
So basically. there is a 59% probability in the calculation that retail owns more than Float x2.  


  
I believe this is why transparency is important. If one was to make a SEC filing over concerns regarding market manipulation, a accurate look into float ownership compared to reported SI% would be a good method for showing that there is something very wrong here.  


I am not arguing for cooperation in terms of trading. I am arguing that legitimate concerns should be raised and brought to the attention of the SEC. A report which accurately depicts ownership of more than 2x float would be irrefutable proof that somewhere in the system something is wrong.  


I understand that this is unlikely to happen as it would require a trusted member of various communities.  


I will now await downvotes and fud callers.  
This was just me playing around with data. I personally only hold 4 shares.  


Look forward to a hopefully civil debate."

I have seen some worry that disclosing their position is not  good thi ng but my argument is that in situations like this, guess work and probability is the  best tool for detecting fraud.

The calculations says that there is a 20% chance of this whole GME thing being a total circle jerk and a 80% chance of it being legitimate concerns over the actual state of the market"
2021-05-06 10:44:08,wallstreetbets,"Basically yes but also my argument is that for such a complaint to have actual weight it would need to be supported by facts not speculations such as mine. I am making alot of assumptions as I need to due to the lack of knowledge I have. I can only assume alot of the numbers. BUT if enough investors showed their position and it could be proved that retail owns more than 92 million shares (float x2) it would be proof of falsely reported SI% on available information.

Hahah... I made money on MVIS 2x in the last 30.

Bought at $10 saw the peak at 26...but didn't accept that kill until it had dropped to $22.  Chart was clear sell at $24, but I weak handed the sale.  That's over 4-5days of trading. 

Got back in at $13 last week sold it at $16 2hrs later.  

I wouldn't own it at these prices for long, but you can use this volatility.  

MktCap of MVIS exceeds that MS pentagon contract...and they only sell a piece of that... MS won't buy them because they don't do hardware, and even if they did buy them it won't be for massive gains to the share price.  You might own this for future growth but it's not likely to explode, and not from these prices.   Fun play though.   

Today I'm liking RKT sale price...bounce off this should be nice."

Estimates are great and all, but if you look at Q1 2020 versus what was just released, those are some great figures. Really comes down to how you evaluate the numbers (Q1 2020 vs. Q1 2021, or do you look at Q4 vs. Q1 2020).

I'm in a weird spot as well, as this is all capital gains money that would be going to the IRS (I liquidated a lot of stock to buy a house when the market peaked, and I was unsure how much we would need), so I am either writing this off as a loss versus my capital gains or making more (clearly not right now).

I didn't expect it to rocket to the moon, but definitely not drop 14%+, especially for missing EPS by one penny. I know a lot of companies have hit or exceeded EPS and dropped, but this drop seems a little unfathomable (compared to Peloton, which makes a lot of sense returning and refunding all those treads, wasted RD / new RD required, brand tarnishment, and lawsuits on the way).

It seems quite undervalued with strong financials. RKT might have missed estimates, but when you look at Q1 from this year and last year, RKT is quite healthy and in a great place."

Speculation, yes. Hype? That’s a little too strong of a word for speculation based on some serious technology that will make the future look like a sci-fi movie. Perhaps it is the right word but all for the right reasons. Shit is literally future tech that we have yet to perfect and utilize, but the implications for doing so are HUGE.

Until some bad news comes out about this company, there’s not really any reason to believe that 20+ dollars is way overpriced. Does it reflect their actual yearly earnings? No, but if we were to base their price on their potential future earnings if they stick to their plan and stay on track (as they have been), then this company is actually way undervalued. So that’s why we are seeing it battling back and forth between 10 and 20 dollars and now possibly 15-30ish dollars with the most recent market activity: investors are investing for different reasons. Some just want a quick buck so they buy low and then sell high and place put options when they sell and play it like it’s a game. Other investors see the potential for a high buyout at some point in the future and are just stockpiling shares for as cheap as they can get them and sitting on them for a year or more so that they can get bought out or just sell for long term gains for cheaper taxes whenever they want to a year from now, knowing there’s a good chance that it will be at an all time high compared to today just based on natural upward growth. Some see this stock as a dangerous investment that has to be timed perfectly on the ups and downs, some see it as a safe long term investment. And just like that, we have frequent violent upward and downward swings but doesn’t drop to a dollar like some people keep saying it will every time it consolidates from a huge run up.


Now might be the cheapest you can buy it at for the rest of your life. My guess is it will keep dropping and test the 12ish level of support. The stock will find a new bottom and chill there for a month or so and the slightest bit of good news could trigger another big run up (though maybe not as big as the last cause that was some bonkers shit). Any seriously bad news for this company will send it into the grave until actual revenue stream from big contracts rolls in which might take a long time so I’m hoping we continue to hear positive news about this companies progress."

Change your paradigm to Apple: They have a solid base in device sales / computer sales. Expanded to app market and sales. Expanded to email. There's a difference between an established company that innovates and creates new products and revenue streams, and a company that has no revenue streams and everything is hypothetical for the future.

It would be nice to have a stock that i wouldn’t be worried too much about price movements, sure, but microvision has potential to go up a lot more than Apple will over the next couple years, percentage wise. If you told me today that MVIS would be up 100% by next year, I’d say yeah I believe it, but I’d also believe that it would be up 100% at some point before next year too. If you told me Apple would be worth 100% more next year I’d be like “ok pussy, make that call order then and show me your loss porn 1 year from now”.

You show me the next stock that will become the new Amazon of stock growth and I’ll invest into it. I’m not saying microvision is the next Amazon or the next Microsoft but I do think they will be in a good position to be bought out by a huge corporation like nvidia or Microsoft. And that means big $$$ 

Call it hype, call it a gamble, it doesn’t matter. Until we see bad news about the company or some actual bad price movements, I won’t dump this stock. Losing 100% gains in a day just feels bloody but it doesn’t hurt until you sell and we’ve seen many times now what happens when you sell on a dip with this stock out of fear of losing it all. You just end up giving out a huge discounted sale to the ones who see this as a good company.

I would love to hear your thoughts on why this company will fail in the long run because I need every reason to liquidate my entire portfolio on the next big run up so I can take a break from this stock madness incase the whole market collapses :O"
2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Am I doing this right? 
2021-05-06 10:28:17,wallstreetbets,I’m not an expert but it’s been my experience that you typically want the numbers to be green. Too much red and you run out of money to trade with and get bored.

2021-05-06 19:15:07,wallstreetbets,But why did you use market orders? you probably left $2K on the table from the spread.

2021-05-06 17:32:19,wallstreetbets,"I scalp amzn calls almost every single day for the past year+ as a 'day job' of sort.

There are easy days where you score 2-4k in a few mins with a handful of contracts (or even with just one).

Then there are days like earlier this week where a bounce never happens cuz Bezos is doing his scheduled shares dump after ER and oops you're now down 15k on contracts that have zero hope of recovering.

For today I was scalping 3270c and 3300c like OP.

High of the day for 3300c was around $31 I think and low was 8.5 earlier in the morning. 

Honestly I'm glad amzn isn't splitting cuz I probably wouldn't be able to scalp on it anymore. Just not the same for number of reasons."

2021-05-06 12:49:47,wallstreetbets,A little guidance please 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
2021-05-06 16:31:42,wallstreetbets,You get paid premiums with covered calls right? I’m an idiot ape that only knows how to bug calls and puts and loses money on both still like a idiot..need a new method to lose money
2021-05-06 11:13:38,wallstreetbets,"What I did was a pure gambling (that's why the name of this sub is wallstreetbets). I bought 10 call contracts of AMZN for $10.678 each around 9:33 am. At that time of my purchase, AMZN stock price was about $3250 and the strike price of the call contracts was $3300 that expires tomorrow. What that means is I speculated that by 4:00 pm tomorrow AMZN will be over $3300 and I paid $10.678 premium per share for that contract. Remember that each contract is my privilege to buy 100 shares of AMZN at 3300 per share. Now if AMZN closes at $3400 tomorrow then I can buy 1000 (10 contracts \* 100 shares) shares of AMZN for only $3300 per shares. Which means I will profit 100\*1000=100K minus the total premium of 10.67K (roughly 89.33K). 

Keep in mind that, most people do not have that kind of money to buy 1000 shares of AMZN and most don't buy these contracts with an intention to buy the underlying stocks.

Now, around 9:38 am, after 5 minutes of my purchase of these contracts, AMZN stock price moved up to about 3270. That's a increase in $20 per share which caused my contracts to increase their value to $18.69. Which means a $20 increase in underlying stock price increased the value of the contracts by $8. In order to understand why only $8 but not $20 you have to understand how these contracts work. Anyways, at that time I sold them at $18.69 per contracts resulting in a total of 18.69K (10 contracts \*$18.69 per share\*100 shares)(remember I paid 10.67\*) netting a total profit of $8K.

I could also make money by buying 1000 shares of AMZN at $3250 per share but that would need me to invest 3.25 million dollars! With that $20 per share price increase I could make 20K instead of 8K but duh! I do not have 3.25 million dollars. Even if I had I would not just buy that many AMZN shares just to make 20K (That's just 0.61% vs 80% that I made).

So far what I have wrote was all good but imagine AMZN went down by 20 in that 5 minutes. In that case I could lose around 70-80% in that 5 minutes! And that happened as many times as I made profit if not more. 

TlDr: I risked $10.6K for some AMZN options expiring tomorrow and got lucky with timing a.k.a gambling paid off. Do not even think about doing this kind of trade with this kind of capital unless you have a clear understanding of how options work. May be try buying a SPY call or put contracts with the same strike price as the SPY price and observe how the value of the contract move with the movement of SPY price."
2021-05-06 10:17:21,wallstreetbets,"Bought options at 10.67 premium, sold them at 18.69 premium"

2021-05-06 12:00:35,wallstreetbets,Don't get excited. He loses everything more often than not. He got lucky.
2021-05-06 14:39:34,wallstreetbets,He bought a 50/50 lottery ticket and won. If he did the trade 1000 times he'd come out close to $0 in profits plus additional losses from trading fees and the loss on the bid/ask spread.
2021-05-06 11:14:58,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-06 16:35:01,wallstreetbets,"Options are leveraged which allows you to make outsized gains and losses compared to stock movement. The capital needed is in the picture. Each option was $1,068 to buy and he bought 10"
2021-05-06 17:03:35,wallstreetbets,"AMZN closed today at $3306.37 and the $3300 call contract closed today at $20.20. Now the difference between the strike price of $3300 and the closing price of $3306.37 is only $6.37. Which means the contract only worth $6.37 because if you buy shares at 3300 when the share price is actually 3306.37, it make sense that you pay 6.37 extra as the premium because that's the actual difference between the true stock price and the strike price. This value is also known as intrinsic value of an option. Now, this scenario is true if the option expire today but he option is expiring tomorrow and no one in this world knows what will be the closing price of AMZN tomorrow. What if AMZN closes at 3400 tomorrow? Which means whoever is selling that option is taking a risk on a speculation that AMZN will lose lower than today. For taking that risk he is charging you an extra $20.2-6.37=$13.83. This extra value of the premium is called the extrinsic value of an option. Which means an option has it's true (intrinsic) value and an extrinsic (mostly premium for taking risk)

Options have five parameters known as Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega and Rho. The extrinsic value of any contract, be it a call or put, at a given time depends on these five Greeks. When a stock price changes over time, depending on how much change and how fast the change is, these parameters change and hence the option contract price. Every option contract has a expiry date and the most important parameter is the **theta** when the expiry date is close. This is basically how much the contract will lose vale in a single day inherently, if the stock price remain the same a whole day. For instance, the one I traded today expires tomorrow and has the theta value of -$15.53. Which means if AMZN remains at 3306.37 the whole day tomorrow and close at that price, that 3300 call option price will be $(20.20-15.53)=$4.67.

Now consider the person who paid $20.2 for the contract buying 100 shares of AMZN at 3300 per share. He will pay 330K for 100 shares. He already paid $20.2\*100=$2020 resulting in his net cost for owning 100 AMZN shares at $332020. Now consider the closing actual price of 100 shares at $3306.37\*100=$330637. A net loss of $1383 per contract. If he bought 10 contract like me then a net loss of $13830 and so on. What is the point?

The main point is there is no guaranty that AMZN will close above todays closing price tomorrow. What if AMZN closes $3270? The price of your option will be 0. AMZN need to close above $3320.2 (3300 for stock+ 20.2 for premium) just for you to break even. If it closes above $3320.2 only then you can make money. If the expiry date is few days ahead and I am at a small loss then I might wait to see if it recovers because that time theta would be relatively smaller than the one that expires tomorrow.

In the above example I simplified many things to make it easy to comprehend. I did not consider the inter-relationship between those Greeks while explaining the decay of option value. Hope it was helpful.

Edit: If it did not go my way I would wait few hours to see if it recovers only if the total loss was below 30%. But I would definitely not hold an option expiring tomorrow overnight."

2021-05-06 12:12:14,wallstreetbets,Missed profit is lot a loss buddy! No work in this world will pay me 8K for 5 minutes of watching a monitor and a few click on mouse. I lost so much money because of this kind of thinking which caused me to reenter a position and ultimately lose all the gain from previous plus some capital as well. These contracts went down to $9 from $18 before going back up. It could go down to $8 and caused my stop loss triggered and I could lose 2K. The point is when I sold those contracts the 8K gain was real but the gain of 2.5X you are currently referring was imaginary at that point. No one can catch the top and bottom although I almost bought them at bottom today.

2021-05-06 19:43:09,wallstreetbets,"Why? Because I was watching level 2 all time while placing those orders. Bid-Ask spread was about 45-60 cents and my buy order got filled right at the center. During sell the same thing. Now if I lost $300 in each transactions due to placing market order, I do not care. For limit order, we usually put a number between the bid-ask spread but in my experience, for highly liquid contracts, Fidelity take cares of that job very well. And also, because they were FDs and I wanted to get out."
2021-05-06 19:17:11,wallstreetbets,Works until it doesn't. When amzn dips it dips fucking crazy and 3% drop means 10k loss in high delta itm options.
2021-05-06 18:58:42,wallstreetbets,I am new to this and do not understand how this works.  Could you explain?
2021-05-06 18:33:11,wallstreetbets,I just bought one call for... what was it... I think 682.5 strike and sold it for $4k within a couple hours last Friday. It cost $1900 though. Was gonna margin and buy 5 but it was a quick play lol Plan on doing the same tomorrow though!
2021-05-06 12:54:12,wallstreetbets,Buy low sell high.

2021-05-06 18:37:18,wallstreetbets,For me I saw (like today) TSLA dip to $660 but slowly start to climb. I figured that $660 was a low point and it would rise so I bought a call for 682 strike because I’ve seen it climb to 690 before dropping again. I made 1500$ in an hour and sold when it hit $710 because I noticed it struggling to rise above that point. I decided that being greedy leads to loss porn (I’ve learned many lessons with other meme stocks) and I’m in it now only for the money lol
2021-05-06 12:18:00,wallstreetbets,"When you sell the contract are you at risk of being assigned the shares if the buyer exercises?
Since you don’t own the underlying shares isn’t that essentially selling a naked call?

Am retarded, go easy on me"
2021-05-06 12:51:44,wallstreetbets,Prob one of the better explanations when asked about contracts. I'm sure people will find this useful
2021-05-06 13:00:42,wallstreetbets,Beautiful explanation.
2021-05-06 14:39:13,wallstreetbets,"I really appreciate you took the time to explain for the ppl who didn’t understand it, like me..."
2021-05-06 13:08:53,wallstreetbets,"Question: If you'd exercise these contracts could you ""churn through"" the buys and sells share after share, so you only need e.g. 3300 starting capital or would you have to fork over 3.25Mil. to instantly sell again for say 3.26Mil.?"
2021-05-06 16:45:11,wallstreetbets,New to options but is there any reason why delta is so high for Amazon? That $20 increase seems to be insane to increase your call premium by that much when it didn't even move the stock price by 1%
2021-05-06 19:38:20,wallstreetbets,May I ask what indicators told you to buy at the time you did? Thanks.
2021-05-06 10:22:59,wallstreetbets,"So you set your own premiums (even if they are bought/sold on the same day) 

hoping someone buys them and it’s basically their fault if they do???"
2021-05-06 10:53:19,wallstreetbets,I would like to master this trade 🐂
2021-05-06 13:46:33,wallstreetbets,I mentioned this several times that the opposite happened more often with me. The thing is with options you win some and you lose some. You just need to win more often (or less but with bigger amount) then you lose. I bought few contracts for earning plays yesterday worth $200 and they are $10 now. I bought some SPY FD in another account today and sold then with $600 profit. Now I don't have to tell about that $600 profit or $200 loss here because tens of thousands of people are gaining or losing similar amount everyday here.
2021-05-06 19:05:47,wallstreetbets,This is also the way
2021-05-06 16:44:37,wallstreetbets,"Unless I'm reading it incorrectly he sold 10, and then bought them back later, no?.  Selling usually requires about 50% of the capital that 100 shares would require.  That's why I asked how much capital he needed."
2021-05-06 11:46:59,wallstreetbets,Dead. 😳
2021-05-06 16:41:24,wallstreetbets,"I was reading top down not bottom up, thanks."
2021-05-06 17:05:51,wallstreetbets,No one has every gone broke taking profit.
2021-05-06 12:23:16,wallstreetbets,"i'm curious about the micro level transaction of this trade. Did you set a limit buy, or was it 10 market purchases? Also on the sell end of the trade, was it also a limit sell? Thanks and congrats on the gains!"
2021-05-06 17:17:37,wallstreetbets,It's not that hard to set a stop limit you never sell early morning if the stock isn't up and Amazon was already down 7 perc on the week

2021-05-06 19:05:46,wallstreetbets,It's just day trading call or put option contracts.  Requires a little capital to get started as the contracts themselves aren't cheap.  I usually do call debit spreads or put debit spreads to help make things a little cheaper.
2021-05-06 13:22:19,wallstreetbets,Instructions unclear. Lost money on puts.
2021-05-06 13:01:25,wallstreetbets,Lol thanks
2021-05-06 14:24:55,wallstreetbets,What kinda crazy strategy is that!
2021-05-06 14:09:45,wallstreetbets,that is the way
2021-05-06 14:33:38,wallstreetbets,"Buy, never sell."
2021-05-06 16:21:12,wallstreetbets,This is definitely not theta gang. Someone  buying to open and selling options the same day is the antithesis of theta plays
2021-05-06 16:20:51,wallstreetbets,Planning on that 25k should be ready by tomorrow. And I didn’t actually get what that theta gang strategy you are talking about ...
2021-05-06 16:58:00,wallstreetbets,Yikes - this is just a day trader buying and sell calls same day. Has nothing to do with theta.
2021-05-06 17:12:44,wallstreetbets,Day trading is literally the exact opposite of thetagang lmfao
2021-05-06 12:23:36,wallstreetbets,"Nah because he didn’t open the sell contract, he was merely selling his right to buy to someone else"
2021-05-06 12:27:07,wallstreetbets,"**No.**

Because my 1st order was ""Buy to open"" and the final one was ""Sell to close""

The risk you are talking might occur if you initiate a ""Sell op open"" because any exercise or assignment can only happen is an order is still ""open"". A closed order is closed. You can initiate a ""Sell to open"" order only if you own the underlying stocks (a covered call) or if you have the highest level of option trading permission from your broker, that does not require you to own the underlying but it does require you to have a good amount of capital + proven experience."
2021-05-06 18:27:27,wallstreetbets,"That would be sell to open. He’s selling to close. Just sold the contracts he already bought. 

Sell to open are called cash secured puts (you have the cash to cover 100 shares per contract at strike price) or covered calls (you have the shares to cover). 

It’s naked when you don’t have the shares/cash. Then you’re on margin."
2021-05-06 13:20:14,wallstreetbets,"No.

In order to exercise 1 contract, you must buy 100 shares at strike price. Every single contract assignment/exercise is equivalent to a single transaction of 100 shares. There is now way to go by fraction here."

2021-05-06 16:50:16,wallstreetbets,"They are most recent transaction to oldest in the screen shot. Whenever you see ""buy to open"" or ""bto"" it means they opened the position by buying the contract. Then vis versa for the sell to close.

If he shorted amzn he would have sold to open which would have been a naked call (or covered call) then he would have had to buy to close."
2021-05-06 19:49:49,wallstreetbets,Underrated comment.
2021-05-06 12:37:50,wallstreetbets,"For this specific trade both were market orders. I watch level 2 data closely to see the bid-ask spread and their sizes. For highly liquid contracts like this one, I do not usually care about 10-15 cents spread and place a market order to open. Because in my experience Fidelity always filled my market orders at a price lower than the ask price somehow. For closing the position I usually place limit order slightly above the ask price if the total profit in that specific trade is something like $500-1K. If the profit is large like this one, I will take that 20 cents less which might lower my overall profit by 200 dollars and that's fine with me."
2021-05-06 17:55:01,wallstreetbets,"When I enter a large position, I have some numbers in mind like cut losses at 20%, lock profit at 30-50%. When it crosses 50%, I usually put a trail stop that represents roughly 20% to preserve my gain. Today AMZN was very volatile in first hour so I decided to lock everything I had at that moment instead of putting the trailing stop loss. That was my best decision because if you look at the price movement , it went to $19-20 at 9:40 but then went back to 13 5 minutes later. If I put that trailing stop at $18 for an amount by $3.5 or $4 then it would hit at $16 or $16.5. So, you got the idea. As for AMZN down by 7% on a week trend, actually AMZN is roughly at the same price it was one month ago. it has been falling since April 30th. There was no guaranty that it will go back up today. My main intention was to scalp and quickly make/loss some money. May be we have different strategy in trading and that's it."
2021-05-06 17:53:16,wallstreetbets,"If you go into a trade with the thought of ""I don't want to lose more than x"" but have no profit goal especially on super short day trades you're going to hit your stop loss way before you satisfy your greed"
2021-05-06 18:36:20,wallstreetbets,"If that was the case, you’d be a billionaire and wouldn’t be on reddit. But you aren’t lol"
2021-05-06 18:47:57,wallstreetbets,"I buy calls. Haven’t dabbled in puts enough yet to be confident enough to use my own money lol If anything I’ll take a small piece of profits and experiment to see what works. If I were you though, I’d buy puts Friday and sell by Tuesday though. If you buy them midweek, you better be scalping or that loss p0rn is going to be fantastic lol
I buy my calls only after the early week dip (so maybe Wednesday-Friday only).

2021-05-06 12:30:47,wallstreetbets,"Okay I think I understand,

The original contract seller/writer is the only one who will be assigned the shares (if the contract is exercised) no matter how many times that contract is sold after the fact.

Do I sort of have it?"
2021-05-06 12:51:19,wallstreetbets,Holy shit. This just goes to show I don’t know how any of this shit works except for buying and selling shares lmaoooo.

2021-05-06 12:51:20,wallstreetbets,"Thats great info thanks, i've been making relatively similar size trades and trying to understand different trading styles. I also definitely agree moving in and out of trades at the cost of a small decrease to gains being important. Also with several option contract purchases, do you enter all-or-none trades/ any part? Thanks!"
2021-05-06 18:17:05,wallstreetbets,where do I cash in my chips
2021-05-06 13:15:59,wallstreetbets,"Most in the money contracts are bought back to close the positions, only about 7% contracts are exercised/assigned. Now there are 100 sellers and only 7 contract holder that want to exercise. How do you fairly select these 7 sellers?  Option clearing corporation (OCC) utilizes a random procedure to assign exercise notices to clearing member accounts."
2021-05-06 12:42:48,wallstreetbets,"Correct! If the contract buyer chooses to exercise the call at expiration, then the person who originally wrote the call will be assigned to sell 100 of their shares at the strike price. It’s referred to as selling covered calls."
2021-05-06 12:48:21,wallstreetbets,"Please do not be fooled by seeing only one side of the trade and assume it's very lucrative! Options can make you a lot of money quickly only if your trades are at the right time and in the right direction. If you enter in a wrong time or the underlying moves against your position, you will lose money so fast that you might not even imagine. 

When I was new, I made a lot of random gains and were thinking like you. But, I lost 33K in a single trade within 2 hours. I survived because all of that 33K was from the profit I made earlier. But imagine losing 33K savings in 2 hours."

2021-05-06 13:14:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’m not about to try and dive into options dick first or anything, just slowly learning about them so that once I hit my current investment goal I can take 15% of my profits and start trading options as well. *(I appreciate the warning)*

That’s a gnarly loss, it would definitely suck to bet the house and proceed to lose it **and** the wife on a bad bet. Was the $33K loss just from the change in cost of the premium? Or were you being assigned shares? Glad to hear it worked out for you in the end and you didn’t even have to stop trading FD’s"

2021-05-06 18:58:03,wallstreetbets,"Actually I don’t go all in on roulette. I study the chart and bet based off of the sequence of colors/rows being played. After awhile I noticed that during certain periods you see more of one color or number in a particular row being played than another and I place my bets to catch that wave. I once started with $20 at Atlantic City and walked away with $800. Took me an hour though. Security guard came up and asked for my id then came back again and said “still here huh?” So I got up and walked to another casino lol

Also, if a whale shows up and starts betting I avoid whatever color or number /row he’s betting on. So yeah, I really like roulette :D"
2021-05-06 13:31:17,wallstreetbets,"That 33K was about 33% loss of a 100K trade with TSLA calls. It was not exactly FDs but TSLA was very volatile that time and stock price was very high (pre-split) and hence the contracts.

I did stopped FDs for about 3-4 months and then made some strict rules regarding cutting losses and gain percentage. For instance, today if I waited 2 more hours with these contracts I could make 10K more but no one knew at 9:37am that AMZN will go up even more after 2 hours, right? And that kind of thinking is one of the major cause most FD players lose money. With FDs you have to be swift both in terms of cutting losses and taking profit. Because theta is at their highest level and the contracts are losing value every single seconds even if the stock price does not move at all."
2021-05-06 14:13:35,wallstreetbets,If you want to learn about options with low risk I always recommend doing it with very vanilla stocks or low price stocks that are not volatile.  AT and T is one I like because it does not move a bunch.  GE is cheap but more volatile.

2021-05-06 13:11:45,wallstreetbets,I lost 25k. This is called options. I brought 25k of GME calls thinking the price will go up. It didnt.

2021-05-06 11:40:58,wallstreetbets,Oh hey 200 strike price premium. Current price 1000.
2021-05-06 13:24:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's why I am doing it on half my GME position. And if I was super worried about missing the mooning, I would use the premium to buy a further OTM call. Now I miss out on lets say gains from $200-$250, but if it goes to a low ball 'ape moon' of 3k, missing those $50 doesn't mean jack."
2021-05-06 13:20:51,wallstreetbets,"I miss a month or so ago, you could sell a single 500C for about $20 a share"
2021-05-06 13:22:52,wallstreetbets,"100 shares during the big dip in February was $4,500. Buy the dip. And no, a $10 intraday drop is not 'the dip' despite what the apes might tell you."
2021-05-06 12:05:09,wallstreetbets,"Taking small amounts of profit many times off small price movements. 

So if you've got $100,000 in $ASS at $100/share and it bumps to $100.50 you sell for a $500 profit, then if it dips back down to $99.50 you buy back in and just keep trading across the little price movements that most stocks see every single day. 

&#x200B;

The risk is that you sell something that's on its way up and not coming back down. Or that you buy something on its way down that just tanks further down."
2021-05-06 11:25:13,wallstreetbets,"Once you’re over 25k in a broker you can trade in and out of positions as many times as you want in a single day.

Scalping means taking advantage of the fluctuations during the day to buy and sell, holding for only a short period of time.  For example, market is up overnight, can sell spy at 9:15 and buy to close at 9:30. After you get a few wrinkles (experience) it becomes second nature for an ape like peeling a banana.

Lunch time 11:20-11:45 and 3:00-3:50 are other easy times to scalp. Use td for faster fils and even get alerts when the mutual funds are getting ready to pump or dump, front run them just like shitadel."

2021-05-06 18:34:39,wallstreetbets,"If you just began your trading journey and are from EU or non-US country, I'd say also go for etoro. I think it is very beginner friendly. It sometimes has some wide spreads, but I think it more than compensates the maintenance fee on ibkr if you have a small account ( ≤$10k  
Except if you wanna do Options of course. Try both, and see which one you like better. Ibkr is maybe better when you have a bigger capital and get more exprienced with trading.   
Also get used to with tradingview if you plan on keeping on using ibkr."

2021-05-06 11:35:02,wallstreetbets,Wow. Appreciate that. Thanks.
2021-05-06 17:02:30,wallstreetbets,Except in his analogy you're literally better off going all in on one hand. In the ultra long term in a casino you **always** lose. If you make small bets over and over and over again you'll just slowly bleed to 0 as the casino's >50% chance to win adds up over time.
2021-05-06 12:07:59,wallstreetbets,More like Theta
2021-05-06 13:29:15,wallstreetbets,"Probably looking at June 4th expiration. I am playing pretty tight, like 20-25% OTM CC strikes with 9-10 days to expiration on them. If the underlying is just miles out I let them expire. If its close but just shy, usually I roll it out to the next week with 1-2 days to expiration and maybe slide up the strike. Plus the strikes I am selling are way over my cost basis so I am more than happy to close those for that price, then I will just sell puts to the 🌈🐻 out there."
2021-05-06 12:43:00,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I've had the warning a few times but never sold what was awaiting the 3 day clearing.

If you used 1/3 of your cash you can use the second 1/3 the next day, and the final 1/3 the next, at which point your sales from the first have ckeare and you can buy/sell again."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$DFEN Direxion Aerospace and Defense DD  

**Positions and Overview:**

Before anything else, my position for you retards.

**2,400 Shares @ 21.32** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1yvxcwfl8ix61.jpg?width=586&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5368491dd33693544377c57c7c9a5cb4e091857d

$DFEN a.k.a The Direxion Aerospace & Defense Bull 3x Shares ETF (Oh god! An ETF? Yes.) has been slowly rising out of misery since March when the Coronavirus knocked-out the Market harder than Ray Rice hit his girlfriend. Based on some extremely intriguing chart analysis, blue-chip companies being the bulk of holdings, many of the holdings benefitting from a return to normal, and a personal YOLO, I believe this ETF has the potential to create big returns in the future. 

**Let’s Now Look At Some Juicy Analytics**

* $DFEN currently sits @ 21.88, before COVID hit the ETF was trading @ 69.30
* When Covid hit, $DFEN dropped to a staggering low of $6.00
* $DFEN debuted in 2017 @ 24.00 and before COVID hit, it has never fallen below the Initial Price ($24 to $70 in roughly 3 years time)
* The CDC announced today they expect to see “A significant drop in the level” of cases by July. This can only help the Airline Holdings of $DFEN

**A Nut-Busting Phenomenon** 

The chart below is the main reason I am intrigued with $DFEN.

$DFEN TOP 10 HOLDINGS (This is roughly 75% of the ETF)

https://preview.redd.it/hggh08779ix61.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=d88e6e5e70c27ab711bf6565bbae6968f7fe6f06

 

**In Summary/Positives**

* 6 out of the 10 largest holdings have yet to recover from Pre-Pandemic levels. However, all of the companies that have yet to recover are Large Cap, Blue-Chip corporations. In addition, the stocks that have yet to fully recover make up roughly 50% of holdings. 
* Instead of trying to bet on one of these companies recovering faster than all others, $DFEN provides an all in one solution for you retards.
* Aerospace isn’t going anywhere 
* Biden’s defense budget is slightly higher than Trump, meaning Gov’t will continue to buy from certain companies being held in $DFEN

**Potential Downfalls/Reasons I am wrong**

* The current economic fears cause market correction (Inflation, Biden Tax Hike, Bubble fears)
* Covid Cases continue to run and stall recovery (Thank you India for your contributions)
* Largest Holding Companies miss earnings
* I have been wrong many times in my life.

\*Again, I am in @ **21.32 with 2,400 Shares**. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I am a simple 19 year old college student who has had mild success in the market (Thanks in large part to WSB #BB #EXPR). If you need a reason to trust me, I have been investing for 3 years and have quadrupled my money. If you need a reason not to trust me, I lost 30% of my portfolio in one day (Thank you Coinbase!)."
2021-05-06 10:21:43,wallstreetbets,lmao this is literally like the hell on earth ETF
2021-05-06 10:02:05,wallstreetbets,"Not really related but this reminds me of another guy who posted a DD going long on defence stocks based on a Lil Yachty album, which includes DFEN, and he's not doing that badly on half of them lmao [https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:bonejohnson8](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:bonejohnson8)"

Would have loved all the naysayers to make these cryptic posts BEFORE the stock took a tumble. But of course, no one did, and now the arm chair market experts are back again. 

Here’s a comment I made BEFORE the earnings calls, showing I was and am consistent in my beliefs on RKT:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4ywd6/saddle_up_rkt/gwzr3l7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

Regarding interest rates: you think the fed is going to increase interest rates AND issue a stimulus at the same time? That never happens. Economy is still recovering, in a lot of markets hasn’t even started yet. Would be foolish to hike rates when we’re not even back to normal."
2021-05-06 13:37:42,wallstreetbets,Nah. I'm just a normal retard. Get with the program.
2021-05-06 12:17:36,wallstreetbets,"That would make just as much sense actually. LOL

edit: that was actually my mistake this time. I read that as $20 for an apple is peanuts, nonsensical. Yes, if you had said $20 for AAPL is peanuts, I would have agreed with you."
2021-05-06 11:24:38,wallstreetbets,Not even worth getting into with you lol first of all you referenced it as a $20 dollar stock like the actual number a stock is at and not it’s market cap is what you should be looking at. And I’ll humor you and take interest rates out of the equation. Did you actually think housing prices would continue to rise to where less and less people can afford them and RKT grows mortgage volume needed to justify a stock increase? Did you not see Apple and Amazon’s quarters and countless other stocks who killed it but are capped bc of the current market and inflation worries. And you thought a mortgage stock currently in the best conditions possible was going to give great guidance and increase growth to justify growing a 40 bill market cap? What did you think interest rates were going lower? Did you think people were magically going to be able to keep buying houses at there absurd prices without any inflation that would drag down the market as a whole and RKT with it?
2021-05-06 12:38:12,wallstreetbets,Yep that’s what I meant. Sorry for the confusion either way.
2021-05-06 12:10:38,wallstreetbets,LOL thank you. The statement of $20 as being cheap for a leading mortgage lender was just mind boggling to me.
2021-05-06 11:34:20,wallstreetbets,"Wow mate you convinced me. You can times the stock price by the number of shares. Clearly I’m intellectually bested here. /s

You’ll take the interest rates out of the equation because you don’t have an answer for that. 

As to the rest of your “argument”, you’re so clearly misinformed. The housing market *was* hot at the beginning of 2020, shortly after COVID. Slashed rates meant everyone with a house was rushing to refinance, despite the economy tanking. It’s tapered off since. Let me ask you this: how do you expect people to be buying houses with unemployment at all time highs, entire industries shitting the bed. No one is affording a monthly housing payment without a job. With the economy opening back up the opposite happens, and will happen for RKT. I don’t expect it to balloon to a $80 billion market cap, but 50-60 B by the end of 2021 is entirely possible.

Anyway, I don’t have any intention of arguing with you on here. You’re free to do with your time and money what you want, just as I am with mine. Next time, make sure your “dire warnings” happen before the actual movement and not after. Hindsight is always 20/20"

2021-05-06 11:56:01,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t “brought”. I bought at more or less the same price it is now, in Feb. I had no intention of holding RKT just through earnings and dumping it for a quick buck.

Now odds are Purecycle Technologies PCT was using a chef in the accounting department, but this is a story as old as the word wallstreet. Let alone the dark side alley known as the StarTrek elf.

This is obviously a calculated attack, and chances are the company will survive and recover. The report mostly attacks the management's character like it is a John Oliver sketch trying to red herring the story with nonsense to later sell the emotional appeal and zero logic argument of the segment.

I am long PCT, but this just seems more of an opportunity attack, similar to Axel dunking on a similar competitor DNMR (similar as in enviro plastic, but not similar in process or material created PHA vs PET)

And so suffices for me. They are bears but the yogi kind. The ones you can emphatize with even if they are eating your picnic basket.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The future of vaccine stocks? WARNING: Not a retard post. Rant incoming 

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/us-backs-covid-vaccine-intellectual-property-waivers-to-expand-access-to-shots-worldwide.html

As usual, American taxpayers fund the creation of the vaccine and the rest of the world demands for our creation for free. The rest of the world needs help but they can ALREADY BUY it from us. Of course taxes need to be raised because we are funding the rest of the world. I get this is a pandemic, but we can make the same argument that the rest of the world needs us to fund food, water, housing, defense, healthcare, etc. “for the sake of humanity.” The list never ends at the expense of American taxpayers.

In the future, we will have less incentive to create anything because we pour in the expense while no one else does. Whoever creates the vaccine loses because the other countries can just get it for free. 

That said, where do vaccine stocks go from here? NVAX, PFE, MRNA all took huge hits following yesterday’s announcement. 

One other thing I don’t get: why does everyone say that “everyone (including vaccinated people) isn’t safe until everyone has the vaccine”.  What kind of nonsense is that, since it implies that the vaccine doesn’t work but magically works when everyone has it. Herd immunity is an ideal, but is not possible unless you force everyone in the whole world to get it with military power. So people saying that it doesn’t work unless everyone gets it are just saying that it doesn’t work at all... lel"

Also - i think the vaccine doesn’t mean you won’t get covid 100% - it means if you do get Covid your symptoms will be less. 
I still don’t want covid just because people refuse to get vaccinated.

Third - some people can’t get vaccines due to medical issues (immunocompromised people, maybe theyre allergic, etc). It’s unfair for people who are able not to get vaccinated and put those people at risk who have no choice. And, since the antivaxxers have been saying that at risk people should stay home this whole time, maybe the antivaxxers should stay home now that there is a vaccine they are refusing!"

2021-05-06 09:47:32,wallstreetbets,Almost like the flu.
2021-05-06 10:46:05,wallstreetbets,"Lots of vaccinated people are still getting sick, some even hospitalized. They're blaming variants. A virus must mutate %60+ for your immune system/vaccine to not recognize it therefore leaving the subject vulnerable. Current variants haven't mutated even %5. Explain how this makes sense please."
2021-05-06 09:53:09,wallstreetbets,"Yep, unless its fully iradicated, itll keep mutating in the non vaccinated hosts and then attack vaccinated people after it suffiently mutated enough to over come the vaccine."
2021-05-06 10:38:11,wallstreetbets,Hmm. Viruses are kind off in a between living and non living stage.
2021-05-06 12:34:16,wallstreetbets,"I’m an investor and it’s been interesting (and kind of shitty) to see the stocks of the companies literally saving the world sometimes going up maybe 25%, then sinking (like right now, obviously). Meanwhile, companies that don’t matter to humanity at all like Pinterest, Crocs and Funko, yes motherfucking Funko, the company that makes those awful figures, are up 100% since November."
2021-05-06 18:05:16,wallstreetbets,"But those people can't get the vaccine, so not everyone can have it."
2021-05-06 09:43:09,wallstreetbets,"The issue is we are lacking raw material

Telling ""everybody"" this is how you do it will only create more strain on supply chain, but now instead of shipping materials to a few places they are sending it to more places. 

The other issue is startup time and to be efficient. 

It will slow down making new vaccines instead of speed it up. The right approach to maximize doses out the door AND compensate companies that developed this is license programs."
2021-05-06 09:34:51,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-05-06 10:29:07,wallstreetbets,"Governments are giving it out for free, money on that end is not the problem. The rate limiting factor is production of high-quality vaccines that people can trust. We have already gone through scandals with AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson over rare side effects. The mRNA vaccines Moderna and Pfizer, which have the best results, undergo an extensive and complicated process to keep the proteins from denaturing. What are we going to do if we give production over to facilities that are not equipped to produce them, and millions of people think they’re vaccinated but aren’t? What about the potential side effects? This process has been slow and painstakingly thorough for a reason, and saying “who cares people are dying” and just opening up the floodgates WILL have consequences. 

Also, I don’t want my BNTX to go down any further."
2021-05-06 12:35:38,wallstreetbets,"I’m an American who lives in Japan, and I often find myself explaining why Americans are sometimes so odd. “You see, there are Blue States, which means people who hold passports and travel to other countries to see what they can find there. And there are Red States, who believe that America is all they need, and never seek ideas outside of their own bubbles.”"
2021-05-06 11:27:33,wallstreetbets,"1. I never took an opinion on your claim. Clearly you didn’t pass 1st grade. 

2. Herd immunity is an unrealistic ideal. You will never be able to reach that unless you force everyone to get it. If herd immunity is the only way we get rid of the virus, then the virus will never be gone. 

3. You don’t understand relativity. No one here bought NVAX at $3-30. It’s like saying “oh no S&P dropped in half but still went up 200x since it’s inception. What are you complaining about”. 

Possibly, but this is a DISCUSSION, not a dissertation. Here’s the [definition ](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/discussion) in case you don’t know what it means."
2021-05-06 16:49:45,wallstreetbets,Even if it doesn’t get passed in the US which it easily couldn’t it still doesn’t mean their vaccine they helped produce would be huge for Ocugens business in India and other developing nations in need of equitable access to a vaccine. Ocugens revenue is not bound to their vaccine just being used in the US
2021-05-06 10:46:39,wallstreetbets,"Just for your information, you cannot fully eradicate a virus that is able to survive on other animals. Never. You vaccinate every year maybe again, but you will not eradicate it."
2021-05-06 10:47:58,wallstreetbets,Don't forget that the highest likely outcome in this scenario is that it becomes weaker
2021-05-06 09:45:19,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately you’re right but my point is privatizing the vaccine is privileged and honestly with how globalized the markets are these days it’s in everyone’s best interest to have the vaccine available to all anyways
2021-05-06 09:35:48,wallstreetbets,Point fingers all you want. Personally I care about getting back to some sense of normalcy (globally) ASAP
2021-05-06 10:08:12,wallstreetbets,"You do realize both of the mRNA vaccines took no money from America right?

Or are you just a delusional trumpster"
2021-05-06 09:47:26,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree that eve home should get the vaccine. There are ways to limit cost without doing this approach

Is the goal that everyone has access to the formula or is the goal that as many people can get the vaccine?

This approach will create a problem in supply chain and lead to fewer doses in the short term which is the opposite of what is needed."
2021-05-06 09:58:44,wallstreetbets,Don’t rely on your government and politicians to tell you when you can get back to a normal life. That’s the first problem.
2021-05-06 09:46:47,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I’m only saying making everything “free” means we are paying for the whole world.
2021-05-06 09:51:25,wallstreetbets,"Look at it this way, there are a ton of ppl in the states turning down the vaccine, why should it just sit around n go to waste (effectively) when people are the world are literally begging for it? Also having the vaccine locked up by IP contracts is beyond naive. Give tax credits to companies making the vaccine, write contracts that require other countries to assist the supply chain, do whatever it takes but for the love of all that is good. Just get it out there and available to anyone who wants/needs it …"
2021-05-06 10:00:10,wallstreetbets,Lololol gtfo. I’m not getting into that debate. Normal life is based on science. The science is herd immunity which requires all who can get vaccinated to do so. Unless you’re immunocompromised there is no excuse to not get vaccinated …
2021-05-06 09:47:52,wallstreetbets,I’m not saying make everything thing free all the time (although the healthcare market is a scam). But with the pandemic we face an extraordinary situation and there isn’t time to debate now
2021-05-06 09:54:46,wallstreetbets,"It is not that simple. You can't just create raw material

I 100% agree on stock piling vaccines when others want it is dumb. The mutations will be an issue for us all

I agree on getting vaccine to as many people as possible as quick as possible

Me and lots of experts do NOT think opening up the IP is a solution. It creates more problems

Push manufacturing building then license to those places. It has to be controlled. What will happen is contamination and fabrication issues leading to problems with doses, wasted doses and people having reactions."
2021-05-06 15:25:04,wallstreetbets,"Science...right. That’s cool, stay home."
2021-05-06 09:56:49,wallstreetbets,I like your logix
2021-05-06 09:57:10,wallstreetbets,Ok fair ofc raw materials can’t just be pulled out of thin air but all this time arguing for the privatization of the vaccine won’t do anyone any good in the end. Time is of the essence here

2021-05-06 12:11:21,wallstreetbets,I wasn’t expecting an undervalued stock to be in the red on the day their earnings came out and smashed all expectations.
2021-05-06 09:57:47,wallstreetbets,And it’s down again.
2021-05-06 11:28:56,wallstreetbets,"This shit already went off a cliff. I had a bunch and it jumped to 100, looked away for a few days and it was at 50"
2021-05-06 11:31:35,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t the price be going up if people were demanding to buy it? Unless the amount being sold is so much it flooded the stock.

2021-05-06 12:15:54,wallstreetbets,It did flood the market. Same thing happened with DISCA and other Arch held. It is momentary drop. I'm going hard with 91c for Jan 21 22 @70. Although I am playing with free money so why not place the. Let the dice roll!
2021-05-06 14:57:09,wallstreetbets,"With the way earning seasons has been going you’re better off playing leaps of you’re going to play options. I picked up some viac leaps instead and only down 35% instead of 90% with plenty of time left to recover.

2021-05-06 14:21:43,wallstreetbets,Yeah I've been learning options and they are literal gambling especially with WSB stocks. Best options are the ones you sell to gamblers. It's nice being the house.
2021-05-06 16:55:35,wallstreetbets,Not all options are gambling. LEAPS are very similar to holding shares for example
2021-05-06 16:56:58,wallstreetbets,Except with a giant upfront premium that requires the stock to move and not trade sideways.

2021-05-06 14:27:15,wallstreetbets,Still holding CLOV but its a very speculative play. Those that are betting on age 60 medicare are wishful thinking. Biden may want it but it wont pass a filibuster. I am holding. Down nearly 50%. The company may do well in the future but the stock just goes down down down. I do believe the draw down is related to multiple things. 1. High value technology stocks continue taking a beating. 2. The stupid hindenburg report which is meaningless. 3. Chamath is appearing more and more to be very disingenuous. Those that slam Chelsea on the board are stupid. That is one of the best things going for the company.

2021-05-06 10:53:00,wallstreetbets,"The real problem here is that their guidance didn't look good for the rest of the year.  A tight housing market, even though demand is huge, and not enough homes being built is a huge problem.  They take the 10% negative and ignore the explosive YoY growth."

2021-05-06 13:53:03,wallstreetbets,I bought in at under $19 this morning and plan to hold it until it gets back to $24+. RKT has a P/E of around 11.35. Not too shabby for a growth company with soaring revenues and profitability.
2021-05-06 09:35:11,wallstreetbets,Nice!
2021-05-06 14:22:13,wallstreetbets,My ass is hurting too but at least mine was shares so I'm just Louis Vuitton bagholding. I feel for the guys that got calls. I drank the Kool aid on RKT earnings and didn't realize the market was as manipulated as it is because there's real shady stuff happening and a. 01 miss should not have been hit so bad. Nothing really makes sense anymore. Im also really pissed at RKT and think they should be doing more for their shareholders by at least hitting the buy back now to drive the price up a little if they haven't already. I think we have a right to know who Gilbert sold his 500m shares to. Yes it was above market rate but it was as we were on a big jump up that day to over 27 and then the bottom fell out.
2021-05-06 15:18:06,wallstreetbets,Well you don’t yolo if you’re not willing to lose
2021-05-06 15:53:18,wallstreetbets,"I bought quite a few shares at 22.75$, is it worth holding, and how long do you think it will take to see either break even or profit?"
2021-05-06 16:49:37,wallstreetbets,"This is why I bought RKT at 24 and have been writing calls ever since. Same with UWMC or whatever that one is. Same with PLTR.

What do I do with the proceeds you ask? Buy PLTR calls with a higher strike of course!"

The SEC's a joke, there's no information on which company or firm was responsible for screwing this stock over, and I doubt Labaton Sucharow's investigation will shake things up for the better with RKT.  Maybe things will get better with the shareholder's meeting on the 25th, im sure quite a few of the shareholders are eager to vent their frustrations about how they've lost a hell of a lot more than we have."

2021-05-06 15:29:19,wallstreetbets,RKT target price around $10. The housing marketing now is a slump. No one will be buying houses at these prices. RKT’s growth will slow down in Q2 and the stock price reflects that.

2021-05-06 18:39:47,wallstreetbets,I lost a couple Gs on that and another Stock at the same time. Won't be doing that again.
2021-05-06 18:54:51,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-05-06 18:56:03,wallstreetbets,I lost $1500 on RKT this week. Been holding shares and calls for months. Shit sucks. Thinking about Dumping and just moving on. The time value of money and opportunity cost is making it even worse. So many other companies and indexes are up 20% or more this year right now.

2021-05-06 10:02:40,wallstreetbets,"I have already accepted the loss. But not by this much, it better bounce back a bit."
2021-05-06 10:20:41,wallstreetbets,"That’s probably a smarter move, given the current state of earnings: they release and the stock burns to the ground or trades sideways. That, or buy the calls early on, before IV starts shooting through the roof, then sell them on the day of or day before earnings when IV has shot up. 

I mean, let’s just look at what happened with AMD: great earning, proceeds to tank by $7. Still no recovery in sight."

2021-05-06 18:12:05,wallstreetbets,That’s not the reason why the stock tanked.
2021-05-06 12:08:10,wallstreetbets,THANK YOU for at least helping me realize my thought processes behind acquiring 100 shares of RKT initially was based on solid logic. Bought in at 23 a share... kinda hurts to see a 3/share drop overnight but guess I have no choice but to hold position
2021-05-06 11:47:04,wallstreetbets,"I find amazing that after hours even exist. In Euronext, there is only 10 minutes of after market I believe. It closes at 17:30 for the pleb and 17:40 for institutions."

2021-05-06 10:48:43,wallstreetbets,"I bought 8 shares yesterday as gamble, the loss is quite small currently, at  $35, but i bought them looking at the overall sideways pattern of RKT, not really worrying about losing much. I don't think it's gonna remain there, it'll bounce up to the usual values, but whether that happens before your calls expire worthless i don't know.But that's the safety of shares."

2021-05-06 09:32:00,wallstreetbets,"They started shorting it at 4:05pm before earnings call of 4:30 so they didn’t know results which were actually great and they just used speculation to drag it down because it’s easy to manipulate market after hours due to low volume. 

People will now run the math and realize how good stock is so will start buying it up, matter of time. Shorters might still try to keep it low a bit longer to make more money but it will fly up as soon as they let it go which they eventually will."
2021-05-06 19:17:02,wallstreetbets,Possible. Or it can keep trending down since the Q2 outlook was slashed by 20%. Add in the fact 40 million Americans are behind on Rent as reported today this means very bad news for homeowners and landlords who are struggling to pay their mortgages. I really do believe we’re in for another Housing bubble burst here soon. Rates are going to have to go up soon as well to stave off inflation. Time will tell But I think I’ve made up my mind and am at peace at which ever way this stock may go. I think there are smarter/better plays right now and I’d like to make up my losses instead of watching this keep drilling for more weeks/months.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The little-known power of operating leverage in the recovery Hi there,

This substack story makes a case for earnings exploding 5-10X because of a market force known as operating leverage. The same happened after 2008 and caught analysts by surprise. Great explanation and infographics here: [https://meanwhileinmarkets.substack.com/p/the-power-of-operating-leverageand](https://meanwhileinmarkets.substack.com/p/the-power-of-operating-leverageand)

Do you think this year will be a repeat of the 2009 explosion in earnings driven by operating leverage (airlines, hotels, etc.)?"
2021-05-06 09:08:50,wallstreetbets,"Key part:

>And in the middle, you’ve got stocks that share both traits and have a good chance to shine in 2021’s earnings seasons.

>For some sector examples, you could look into energy, financials, materials, airlines, hotels and resorts, and industrials—all of which benefit from reopenings and run on high fixed costs. No surprise, these sectors have been some of the best winners in 2021 so far.

>If you are cherry picking specific stocks, working out operating leverage stock by stock is a little trickier.

>You see, public companies don’t spell out variable and fixed costs in their reports. But one way to gauge it is to sift through the company’s quarterly reports and see how an increase/drop in revenues affected its earnings.

>**The formula would be: operating leverage = % change in operating income / % change in revenue**

>The higher the number, the bigger operating leverage the company has. Which means recovering sales will have a bigger amplifying effect on the company's earnings."
2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SEC Chair Gary Gensler raises concerns about Robinhood, trading gamification and social media hype "
2021-05-06 08:53:14,wallstreetbets,"New Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman  Gary Gensler will testify before the House Financial Services Committee  on Thursday. This is the third House hearing focused on [GameStop](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GME), but this is Gensler’s first appearance as chairman before the Committee.

Gensler’s  prepared testimony indicates he will address a broad range of topics  around Gamestop and protection of investors, including:

## ‘Gamification’ of trading.

Gensler  will begin his testimony on the increasing gamification of trading,  which he defined as trading that has “game-like features” — such as  points, rewards, leaderboards, bonuses, and competitions — to increase  engagement.

“Many of these features encourage investors to trade  more,” Gensler said. “Some academic studies suggest more active trading  or even day trading results in lower returns for the average trader.”

Gensler  said he has asked his staff to prepare a request for public input: “We  need to ensure investors using apps with these types of features  continue to be appropriately protected.”

## Payment for order flow

Many  brokers now send their orders to market makers in exchange for  payments, a process known as “payment for order flow.”  The market  makers can either execute the orders directly or pass it on to an  exchange or other trading venues.

Because higher levels of trading  generate more payment to brokers, Gensler asked: “Do broker-dealers  have inherent conflicts of interest? If so, are customers getting best  execution in the context of that conflict? Are broker-dealers  incentivized to encourage customers to trade more frequently than is in  those customers’ best interest?”

Gensler  did not directly address these questions, but implied the recent  enforcement action against Robinhood was a warning sign. “Robinhood  explicitly offered to accept less price improvement for its customers in  exchange for receiving higher payment for order flow for itself. As a  result, many Robinhood customers shouldered the costs of inferior  executions; these costs might have exceeded any savings they might have  thought they’d gotten from a zero commission.”

## Equity market structure

That  payment for order flow has turned into a lucrative business. Gensler  says about 38% of equity trading volume is executed by those  off-exchange wholesalers. Citadel Securities, Gensler noted, has  publicly stated that it executes about 47% of all retail volume.

Gensler  asked if this concentration was consistent with the SEC’s mandate to  promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets.  “History and economics  tell us that when markets are concentrated, those firms with the  greatest market share tend to have the ability to profit from that  concentration,” he said, “I’ve asked staff to look closely at these  issues to determine which policy approaches may be merited.”

Citadel  Securities declined to comment. However, in testimony in February of  this year in the House of Representatives, Citadel founder Ken Griffin  said: “With respect to payment for order flow, we simply play by the  rules of the road. Payment for order flow has been expressly approved by  the SEC. It is a customary practice within the industry. If they choose  to change the rules of the road, we need to drive on the left side  versus the right side, that’s fine with us.”

## Short positions: Should they be disclosed?

Hedge  funds and other investors who hold significant stock positions are  required to report long positions on a quarterly basis, but those who  hold short positions are not. 

That has led to calls that short  sellers should also be required to disclose their positions:  “Enhancing  disclosures could improve market efficiency and end some wild  speculation (and misinformation) about short selling and short  positions,” Tyler Gellasch, executive eirector of Healthy Markets, said  in an open letter to Gensler.

Gensler told the committee he has  directed SEC staff to prepare recommendations for the SEC’s  consideration on short selling disclosure.

## The Archegos mess

Though  unrelated to GameStop, Gensler also brought up the failure of Archegos  Capital Management and the losses incurred by several banks that  provided prime brokerage services to them. The “core” of the problem,  Gensler said, was Archegos’ use of total return swaps based on  underlying stocks, and the significant exposure that the prime brokers  had to the family office.

Gensler said he has asked his staff for  recommendations on whether to include total return swaps and other  security-based swaps under new disclosure requirements. 

## Social media hype

Gensler  also raised concerns that wrongdoers will attempt to use social media  to hype stocks or manipulate markets.  He offered no specific  suggestions, but said that “This is an area for which we will continue  to deepen our understanding, resources, and capabilities.”

## Margin requirements

Gensler  noted that “at least one firm didn’t have sufficient liquidity to meet  margin calls and had to fundraise within hours to meet $1 billion-plus  obligations, and several brokers chose to shut down customer access to  trading.”  Gensler said this raised questions about whether margin  requirements are sufficient, and whether broker-dealers have appropriate  tools to manage their liquidity and risk. “I’ve asked staff to look at  these issues carefully,” he said.

## Shorter settlement period

Stocks  currently take two days after a trade is made to settle, a convention  known as “T + 2.”  Gensler noted that “the longer it takes for a trade  to settle, the more risk our markets assume” and that the technology  exists to eventually shorten the settlement cycle to T + 1 or even  same-day settlement.  “I’ve directed the SEC staff to put together a  draft proposal for the Commission’s review on this topic,” he said.

## Where is the SEC going?

While  Gensler’s comments lacked specifics, analysts noted that his comments  clearly indicated the direction he was taking the SEC on these issues.

“This  is the first time he has come out, and he is pretty negative on payment  for order flow and the concentration of market makers,” Rich Repetto  from Piper Sandler told me, noting his remarks were “troublesome for  e-brokers and market makers.”

Repetto also said not to mistake the  lack of specifics for lack of direction:  “When he says he is  ‘directing’ his staff he is implying there is going to be some kind of  action,” noting that the committee will now expect some kind of update  on what the SEC is doing in the coming months.

Indeed, Gensler told the committee his staff would be publishing a report on market events over the summer.

Gensler  also left the door open to enforcement actions against those violating  SEC rules:  “While I cannot comment on ongoing examination and  enforcement matters, SEC staff is vigorously reviewing these events for  any violations. I also have directed staff to consider whether expanded  enforcement mechanisms are necessary.”"

Everyone in the world knows that these are dangerous and addictive, many people still make the conscious choice to use them anyway. Babying laws don't protect you me or anyone, they take away our freedom of choice.

Think of it this way: Wet stairs are are dangerous and you might slip on them and hurt yourself. The answer isnt outlawing spilling water or mandating single story buildings.

He totally ignores manipulation by mainstream media and focuses only on social media. That's not an accident. Sure he says some things that look hopeful but the other shit just muddies the water because he's giving legitimacy to wasting resources on worrying about people being enticed to win dumbass points on leaderboards and just paint Robinhood as the only scapegoat. Did YOU read it or do you just love the taste of Gary Gensler's ass? Everything he speaks to is a ""We'll look into it"" response, and he addressed this ""gamification"" bs right off the bat. Whether or not he has empty words about doing the right thing, all he has done so far is give MSM more garbage to feed off of by throwing out vague statements about key topics that actually matter. The only problem he actually went into detail with in terms of solutions is in regards to the Archegos debacle no doubt because the banks were the ones that lost money on that. I think it's pretty justified that a lot of people here are interpreting in that way because that's how the SEC has acted in the past and I really doubt this guy alone is gonna change that.

Edit: and to add to hammer home the point, more orders = more payment for order flow."
2021-05-06 15:15:13,wallstreetbets,"the flash crashes seem to be coming from large institutions placing massive short bets and then doing everything in their power to crash the price.  The buy and hold strategy is not really what large investors have ever done.  What theyre worried about is that they will have to compete with retail, who is now looking at the same strategy as the big players.  Suddenly, their ability to reliably manipulate the market with large buying power gets dwarfed by the combined wealth of retail traders working together with sound strategy.  Thousands of retail traders with social media can do exactly what the groups of professional traders have been doing for decades.  The playing field is leveling and theyre the ones who currently benefit."
2021-05-06 16:48:00,wallstreetbets,">As more people shift away from that strategy we will see more flash crashes.

Nowhere did he say anything about meaningful, impactful consequences. You can add consequences all you want, but when the grand total for an entire year of not meeting the requirements results in $109,000 in fines... you might as well say you'll fuck over the little guy and give a slap on the wrist to the Shitadels of the world.

That's the only thing I think was severely lacking - no mention of how fines and penalties are so miniscule that the bigger fish just chalk it up to the cost of doing business.

Make $2b in illegal trading activities? Get fined $500m. Okay, cool, cost of doing business.

Edit: hell, Shitadel even said this in a previous hearing! Change the rules of the road? Okay, we'll just drive on the left to comply. This was basically their way of saying it doesn't matter what rules you put in place, we'll make it work to our advantage."

honestly I dont see a problem with that.  Its what everyone does.  The fact that they are willing to change the rules and sound like they wont fight it is a good thing.  The only thing id worry about is them saying one thing and then donating millions to politicians to oppose it for them."

2021-05-06 16:41:47,wallstreetbets,"Wtf does gamification have to do with market markers, and brokers hiding behind regulation to prevent GME from rocketing? Gamification has nothing to do with retail getting screwed in the context of recent events. 

The problem is that RH exposed everyone to the fact that it’s all a rigged game and that undermines the whole system. At least everyone knows that a casino is rigged against them. Everyone is fine with a casino using gamification  to trick you out of your money. Maybe RH needs to be more open about being a casino."

RH shouldn't gamify trading though.  It leads to kids getting into it, especially ""new"" adults who have no experience.  EA did this with ""loot boxes"" and called them ""surprise mechanics"" in a hearing to justify keeping it.  It was all a way to get more money out of the customer."

2021-05-06 11:07:58,wallstreetbets,"Furthermore, it's not the government's job to coddle people. They are rational actors. If people didn't want gamification, they would utilize a different brokerage."
2021-05-06 11:19:46,wallstreetbets,"So you think they made the wrong call restricting the use of opiates in America? Same shit, different flavour. 

Gamification seeks to stimulate addictive behaviours in users, often in subtle ways. If they want to operate like a casino, they can be regulated like one."
2021-05-06 11:46:16,wallstreetbets,"So you're willing to restrict the rights of all Americans just because some can't into being responsible? That's my issue.

Punishing everyone because some people play a very obvious game.

Maybe I would be more willing to think this is truly a charitable move, but all I've seen the government do for the past 15 years is find a way to unnecessarily inject themselves into private transactions and fuck it up when they do so.

Some people get hurt. Some people die. Yes, let's prevent the obvious, malicious bullshit. But treating people like they're not rational actors only fulfills the prophecy because they're not held to any standards of morals or responsibilities."
2021-05-06 14:05:48,wallstreetbets,"Whose rights are being restricted? Corporate rights? This is not something individuals would generally seek out.

Gambling addiction is not rational. If McDs had a way to get nicotine into their burgers to encourage customer retention, I'd be opposed to that as well. It's the surreptitious nature of the act, that many rational actors wouldn't see coming."
2021-05-06 14:29:21,wallstreetbets,"Well yes, the right of corporations or any individual or business to provide a gamified brokerage experience.

I understand some people have gambling addictions. Just like some people have drug addictions, or porn addictions. But I don't believe that those people that are responsible enough to engage with gambling, porn, drugs should be prevented from doing so just because some people can't. 

I don't care about the gamified experience that much. I'm 99% low cost index fund investing, but I do enjoy throwing a few grand around specifically to speculate/gamble, and I've much appreciated the ease at which I can jump in and out with the direction the more gamified services have taken the brokerage market."
2021-05-06 14:40:07,wallstreetbets,"It's the difference in delivery that makes it a problem. I'm not saying ban gambling, or porn, or games. If you go to a casino, you know what you're getting yourself into. You're going to lose money. It's entertainment.

I'm saying regulate trading platforms that integrate gambling mechanics in subtle ways to get people hooked. You're a trading platform, or a gambling platform. Choose one. It's about deceiving a customer using psychological tricks, in a manner that could have a profound effect by way of eliminating their life savings. Addictive games (glorified slot machines) with micro transactions are bad enough. This just takes it to the next level."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I think PGM's are at the bottom of a long bull run Everywhere you see, new car production is down, but demand is up. People can't make cars, people are buying cars, we even have used cars being used as an inflation hedge. Auto Nation, the most rednecky retailer in the USA, has almost tripled because of car demand.

But we're running out of new car inventory, according to all auto retailers. And while production is super-low, factories closed everywhere, PGM's are super high anyway, even though PGM mining production hasn't dropped a ton. The only thing PGMs are used for (today) is catalytic converters, but soon they'll be in all of the hydrogen electrolyzers too.

Sibanye bought Lonmin at the rock bottom of the platinum market. And then held them over the fire and renegotiated the deal, when platinum was at its lowest price ever. Best cost/ unit producer out there. I feel like their high, but stable, but high, but stable, price this last month, is about to take off, because of platinum prices. But I'm waiting for a dip anyway because the PGM market is nuts and I don't trust stability.

Back in 2014, there was a big ""Platinum War"" where it was at 1400/oz (Sibanye bought Lonmin when it was 680/oz) new mines were being opened, ect, based on a 1400 ounce, (insert 'one does not simply open and close a mine' meme) then Europe switched from consumer diesels to electrics, PGMs tanked, and all the mines tried to keep staying open anyway. Low cost producers over-produced to force their higher cost competition out of the market by tanking the price even more. It worked. They flooded the market with platinum that is still getting burned off, and long term production tanked. Last time I checked, PGM production was below demand, pre-pandemic. There's someone out there who makes a good report if you want to check. Russia is opening a new platinum mine in Zimbabwe that should be open sometime.

All I'm saying, is that when auto plants can stay open 24/7 after their workers are all vaccinated, there's a lot of demand to catch up on. And have you seen rhodium prices lately? Rhodium is used in hardening all PGMs for all industrial applications and is SBSW's biggest profit driver. What happens when platinum stops being dirt cheap, the excess is burned off, and the production deficit (mining production) is still there?

This is the bottom of a long bull run that could have some crazy spikes from PGMs, especially rhodium, becoming more scarce. SBSW is the only PGM buy."

2021-05-06 09:33:27,wallstreetbets,My understanding is that the fallout in platinum was from consumer diesels sales dropping back in 2015.  I don't have any data to say that the number of diesels has recovered.  Could it be more companies getting on board with the EPA tier 4 engine requirements?  Do you think we are heading for an industrial boom and resurgence of diesel engines?

2021-05-06 08:12:22,wallstreetbets,"Everything looks weird because we turned the bots off and suspended all rules for like twelve hours.

I'm about to flip everything back on with slightly more lax settings and get the sub back in order.

I know it's easy to believe stories about us and buy into memes about how we're shills or whatever, but we turned that deluge of shitposts into a decent feed every day since 2016 because we enjoy contributing. Do me a favor and challenge the next person alleging something about us to provide proof. Ask them who would benefit the most from convincing a bunch of people that /r/wallstreetbets is compromised.

If you trust me, then believe me when I say things are good. There are no shenanigans. Things have changed around us and while we can always adapt, we can't compromise and appease people when we think they're asking us to do the wrong thing. I'd rather see other stock subs carry the torch than allow rule-breaking content solely to not upset someone. I'd like to think of WSB like a sports league subreddit (NFL, NHL) and the single-stock subs as teams. There's no reason for us to fight. They can plumb the depths of their sole interest, we can be generalists. We've always had high standards while simultaneously being kinda retarded and I don't want to lose that.

I hope that all the good work we did and still do isn't forgotten for low-information insults and conspiracy theories. Don't buy all the BS, nothing has changed on our end. Same mods (without the old shill mods), same rules, same effort.

Hell, if people are still convinced that we're somehow exerting control in nefarious ways I'd go so far as to livestream mod logs/spam submission queue."

1. Wait for earnings reports

3. The stock just dumped after earnings, then
4. Buy as many calls as you possibly can for like 3 months from now that are already ITM or very close to it
5. Set your sell limit at 15% and walk away

Saves a lot of time frothing and worrying about the stock market and staring at a screen, and minimizes risk. Rinse and repeat.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

I will scale in until I am profitable, and then I will blow this load so hard it hits the fuckin' moon.

I’m not just speculating here, pretty much everything in the WSB basket has been downhill since the GME/meme craze peaked (GME excluded, because whales).  It’s like the market collectively said “hold my beer” and turned on one shot kills mode for everyone who’s never seen a nightmarish rotation like this before.  Yeah I’m sure there are a bunch of exceptions but for the most part EV, small mid/cap tech, memes, green energy - all WSB favorites last year have been utterly destroyed.  Sure there are other factors at play (bond yields, interest rates, inflation fears, politics, blah blah blah this mostly noise) but you can’t ignore the timing of this and the fact that some of it is probably restitution/retribution for losses taken in meme stonk shorts.

They say everybody in dotcom knew it was a bubble, but it wasn't really clear it had popped until May/June, months after the peak. Here we are again. 

We either see an epic unwind over the next 6 months, or hyperinflation as the monetarists scramble to save the asset holders.

While he likes Hayward's outgrowth and sees favorable risk/reward, he would like more visibility into trends as activity normalizes, said Pokrzywinski in explaining his rationale for an Equal Weight rating on the shares."

Example:

Stock = $40  
Stop = $35  
Limit = $32

Stock drops to $35, it creates a limit order of $32, if the price is above $32 the order can trigger (usually instant unless the earth is falling out below) .It can also be done to stop and limit the same price or set the limit higher. The stop is what triggers the limit order."

2021-05-06 10:40:06,wallstreetbets,"From a kid’s perspective, the goal of the game is to match the shapes up to the hole that fits the shape. They learn that shapes will fit in the hole that looks like the shape. To just put everything in the square hole shatters the rules of the game and also the kids understanding of the shape/hole relationship, so even if they know that other things fit in the square hole, it feels wrong to do it.

It’s kind of like how kids learn that adding two numbers makes a bigger number. Then one day they learn about negative numbers and that adding no longer means making numbers bigger, it breaks what they thought were the rules of addition and frustrates them because numbers no longer work in a way they’re comfortable with."

And finally i want you to remember the beyond amazing earnings we had from main QQQ heroes (baring that piece of shit ticking time bomb that is TSLA)

but as a reminder, you can check earnings estimate for technology here [https://www.yardeni.com/pub/if-ste.pdf](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/if-ste.pdf)

Right now QQQ is trading at 29x Next twelve month's earnings

Earnings shall be revised up & i let you conclude with regard to that 29 number and what that does to QQQ 

Now to adress some questions : **Why are Qs so shit since the earnings ?** 

**I've identified 3 themes let's discuss all of them :**

A) Chips shortage story which is now correctly being identified as an issue with double (and triple) ordering from asian clients - This is a problem for the ""value"" semis (MU & friends) not the super structural growth semis (NVDA & friends, though NVDA has another problem called ARM and AMD another problem called XLNX) - My view on SMH is not really bullish but contrary to what people may think it's not that big a deal for Qs and you can just avoid them if you pick another etf

B) MTUM Rebalancing : Momentum N-12 Type strats are supposed to reduce their tech exposure in favor of banks and such which leads to a lot of HFs trying to front run this move. it's a may thing and should be over very soon

C) the most important one : This idea that a lot of ppl are selling big winners to reduce their tax bill because Biden will probs manage to increase cap gains tax. Due to a lot of reasons which are not important to us in effect, this is more something that some ""smart"" HFs are trying to front run than something which actually exists. This sets them up for a massive squeeze < 17 May

Besides these little quircks QQQ is FAR below where it should be given the EXTREMELY NEW ACCOMODATIVE stance that the FED is giving us and the EXTREMELY GOOD earnings. 

some sellside analysts already have a 5K target for AMZN since the earnings ... 

**TLDR Buy QQQ 350 for any expiration after 17 May depending on your risk tolerance**"
2021-05-06 04:54:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm all in TQQQ already
2021-05-06 08:52:24,wallstreetbets,It’s simpler than that. QQQ will hit target if JPOW keeps rates at zero for the next two years due to employment and inflation goals. JPOW super woke and will wait until unemployable nephew Steve gets his job and the price of a television moves up 5% before he starts cutting rates
2021-05-06 08:11:22,wallstreetbets,"You pump QQQ, but use the S&P Tech sector for your graphics.  Either you're an idiot, lazy, or are trying to put one over on the Apes.

YOLO"
2021-05-06 05:09:32,wallstreetbets,I agree with near term high for QQQ being around 350 but your reasons are trash.  the real reason is algos are following elliott wave theory so the computers needed to sell off qqq.  the next closest real reason is thst inflation fears make higher rates a threat which is bearish for growth stocks

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A Tree Hugging guide towards speculative long investing. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I wanted to provide a different perspective on investing that might entertain or help others. Nothing I say should be considered fact, but instead my opinion. There is no guarantee of returns, but I believe my method lowers the long term risk while maximizing on potential less volatile gains. I do not have any positions in these companies, but I intend to add some or all of these positions to my portfolio.        

My thesis is generated around the semiconductor meeting held by the White House. I believe the White House tipped their hand into which companies will be their preferred partners of the future. This article will provide a layout of which stocks may be considered attractive from a long term speculative point of view. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/white-house-to-host-over-a-dozen-companies-at-chips-meeting.          

Stellantis NV, General Motors, Cummins and Ford: old school American companies with a large number of employees and a large supply chain that relies on Ford and GM to remain in business. I believe they were invited to the meeting because of their relationship with Biden from the Obama administration. Gas for tronics 2.0?       

Alphabet: tech company that has government contracts. Can provide unique insight into current and future trends based on search history.           

Dell, HP, Medtronic: computer and medical equipment manufacturers. It’s interesting how Nvidia and AMD were left off the invite list.         

Micron, Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung, Intel: semiconductor manufacturers. We all know about the chip shortage.       

AT&T: possible link to 5g capabilities/access. I’m wondering who the government is going to give their grant money to for providing rural areas with affordable internet and broadband.         

Northrop Grumman: we all know about the b-21. I believe that is likely why they got the invite, but there is also the potential that they are developing the 6th gen fighter of choice for the military.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV - the biggest chance for a Gamma/short squeeze out there! Call OI and short float exceeding public float. + potential catalysts🎆 Hi there apes,

So since the wrong SI% of float report came out, lots and lots of calls have been bought (maybe too many?). Right now the SI% of the float is actually still very high around 41% according to S3Partners, equal to 44.7m shares shorted. This leads me to the next thing, the total OI for calls is 598,882. If all these were to be executed that's 59.8m shares. So 59.8 (call OI) + 44.7(shares shorted) = 104.5m shares. The public float is 109.8m shares. Vanguard holds 26.2m shares. If you add these 26.2m shares to the 104.5m shares that is a total of = 130.7m shares. 20m+ shares MORE than the public float? Even if Vanguard sold covered calls on all their shares that would leave us with only 5.5m shares not being sold CC's on (not very likely) So this means lots and lots of these calls are sold naked!

For a gamma squeeze to happen you would need lots of calls at different strike prices, which CLOV has! Actually, it's insane to me how this many May and total calls have been sold, with literally no shares to back them up. Options table of CLOV below:

&#x200B;

What could be the catalyst start all this? Well ER is on the 17th of May, so before all the may call expire. Furthermore, the DOJ investigation (what actually caused CLOV to go down in the first place) is now over. No PR yet, so I assume they will bring this up on ER!

Other than that, they have not yet made an announcement, but they just got approved to expand in 10 more states. That is massive. On top of that Biden and democrats are looking to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60. That will help Clover get a bunch of new customers.

I hope all these apes understand. Just because that first attempt failed to go over 12 is evidence that this is heavily shorted. If this consolidated at 12 those 10 and 11 dollar call options would start gamma, and push shorts to cover, which at this point would take them 3 days at current trade volume. The way to make money is get in before the storm which is now, not after it’s gone up 30% in one day."

2021-05-06 05:53:19,wallstreetbets,"Remember all those who  sold naked calls do not want the stock to go up. 

So they are probably shorting the stock as we speak and Will try to defend  its positions after ER. 
If ER is good and accusations is dropped, volume could get so high that they cant hold the shares below call price. 

So then they loose massive on all calls, after that they Will rebuy all shares they have shorted to defend their calls.

Same technical approach but you willfully ignore the facts of one while embellishing the other's. Interesting approach."
2021-05-06 10:42:28,wallstreetbets,"Yes indeed, they have or we need to buy alot so shorters cant push us lower"
2021-05-06 14:20:55,wallstreetbets,Good point. Selling the news at a loss isn't exactly a prime investment strategy

2021-05-06 09:26:44,wallstreetbets,"Since you are talking odds, how many legit gamma squeezes have there been in the last 5 years? Now take that against the total number of stocks. This isn't going to happen."

2021-05-06 09:58:26,wallstreetbets,Guess we’ll see. GME has just become a cult and I’m tired of it
2021-05-06 02:34:42,wallstreetbets,LMAO SOS has only gone down plus they diluted their shares by 50% ahaha suck it up
2021-05-06 02:33:59,wallstreetbets,SOS $12-$4 🤡
2021-05-06 09:43:50,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I mean you probably shouldn’t take the bet then, I’ve been involved in two blue apron and overstock and made money so there my confirmation bias."
2021-05-06 18:07:56,wallstreetbets,Gamma squeezes happen all the time on small scales
2021-05-06 09:49:26,wallstreetbets,You mean against the total number of heavily shorted stocks or potential squeezes.
2021-05-06 09:45:48,wallstreetbets,I didn’t see that and I’m thankful for that lol otherwise I would’ve thrown more in. I read about them having earnings yesterday and inquired with my parents and some people who bought houses recently. 2/5 used rocket and the rest were scattered thru others sooo I figured might as well throw money at the majority.
2021-05-06 11:54:09,wallstreetbets,"You can be tired of how people talk about it, that's fine. But lying to yourself and others about it is pretty dumb. The same principles you're applying to clov are still valid to gme and in fact magnified"
2021-05-06 09:54:53,wallstreetbets,I am not a fan of the recent uptick in everything being called a squeeze. They just don't happen that often. There are idiots in here trying to catch each one (looking at you $25 AMC and $800 GME people) and are going to seriously ruin their financial lives.
2021-05-06 18:11:08,wallstreetbets,What do you consider small? People here think 5x and they happen all the time.
2021-05-06 09:57:00,wallstreetbets,"Either one. We have had about 10 listed since GME and none of them have done anything but lose idiots/gullible people money.

Check out RKT and their promised gamma squeeze. Check out the guy that has given almost all of his 2M back trying to chase a second pop in GME.

Also, I wish everyone would stop calling a little jump in price a squeeze."
2021-05-06 12:26:09,wallstreetbets,It’s not magnified. A simple short report debunks that.
2021-05-06 09:58:18,wallstreetbets,"That’s fair, they are rare, but hey these dudes could be playing black jack or craps you know. It’s hard to play Dad to the masses."
2021-05-06 10:07:50,wallstreetbets,i don't pay attention to squeeze plays but ones that do come into mind since gme are ASO and MVIS. Didn't RKT squeeze back in Feb? But eitherway I'm sure the odds are pretty shit lol
2021-05-06 10:40:11,wallstreetbets,RKT jumped 70% in one day and made the smart ones quite a hefty windfall
2021-05-06 12:40:25,wallstreetbets,Prove it
2021-05-06 10:50:41,wallstreetbets,"""smart"". Right. Every gambler thinks they made money based on them being smart and not from getting lucky."
2021-05-06 14:46:16,wallstreetbets,Ok. 19% vs. 40% lol. Prove its being shorted through ETF or any other cult like mindset.
2021-05-06 11:18:07,wallstreetbets,The smart ones sold. The other gamblers didn't. Luck doesn't make you sell. Being slightly less retarded makes you better
2021-05-06 17:11:55,wallstreetbets,Go read the DD there's a ton of it. 19% vs all the DD that showed it was borrowed over 100% you really buy that they covered their shorts in January? Yeah I spend big money to go say inconsequential things on major news networks all the time. And all the media manipulation that's ridiculously abundant. There's proof left and right of them manipulating shit. Seeking alpha paying people to write anti gme articles and saying what they want. MarketWatch publishing stories about dips that dont occur for another 20 minutes. Yeah nothing shady is going on at all.
2021-05-06 11:19:05,wallstreetbets,"Ah, yes. I agree. Greed got the better of people."
2021-05-06 18:11:32,wallstreetbets,"You’re insane.  Get over it lol.  You think you’re the first person to notice manipulation in a 100’s year old market?  LOL.

The naked shorts did cover.  Get over it."
2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Oatly IPO Is anyone else investing in the food and beverage industries? Oatly the plant based milk company filed for an IPO. There has been a lot of hype around the company a few years (in Northern Europe at least) and apparently penetrating new markets has gone well for them.

They’re reporting losses, which is normal in the stages of investing in growth. Profitability is not a requirement for buying a stock anyways, but couldn’t find their financial reports so doing DD is still to be done.

Thoughts about this? Not the easiest industry to take over but the trends are quite clear. Or is this one of those feel-good stocks some people mention they own in cool coffee shops?

Some news about this:

They've been in Scandinavia, at least as far as I know Sweden, for more than a decade. Always sold out or low on stock here in Northern California even with other brands jumping in the oat milk band wagon. Their vanilla ice cream is also legit vanilla 🤤"
2021-05-06 10:18:10,wallstreetbets,I like their products.  Therefore .....moon.

I've been waiting years for them, oat based ""milk"" is the future for me compared to soy, almond, rice w/e.

This is gonna be one of my 10y holds."
2021-05-06 09:28:42,wallstreetbets,I used to drink oatly i just hate how fast it expires. They only have regular sized cartons and they expire in a week.
2021-05-06 03:01:08,wallstreetbets,"Take a look into any discounter, this is easily substituted"
2021-05-06 03:27:26,wallstreetbets,"Starbucks is also offering it as an alternative at all its locations. I would only worry that other companies will just replicate their formula if they do not pivot to more products. Costco has already started creating their own oat milk (which I buy). 

Side note: Thanks OP for the actual DD. This is hard to come by in the subreddit, recently."
2021-05-06 04:01:02,wallstreetbets,"True, and already is. Practically isn’t a majority of products that companies sell, any kind in fact, easily substituted? I do not think anyone buys or should buy company’s stocks solely because of their products?"
2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Time to go full retard on stonks again The entire inflation trade is a zero-sum trap, not just shit coins. Don't think you're smarter because you own lumber futures or $KHC calls. Questioning the Fed's power to do its job is a fool's errand at this point. It handily beat deflation during 2020's insanity. This is cake.

If there was ever a time for the market to question JPow, it was in late March 2020. There the problem was deflation with the outlook of a depression. The Fed never dealt with a shock like that before and had limited tools to fight it. Beyond pegging rates to zero, there wasn't much else. JPow and his team found the rocket dial on their money printer and turned it to full burn to blast the market out of its deflationary death spiral.

Now, the Fed can raise interest rates to infinity in lock step with rising prices to tame inflation when they want. This Fed power is far more effective than money printer go brrrr. Paradoxically, this means they never have to actually use it.

Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. JPow doesn't want or need to spook markets. Given the credibility he now has in the market (after the 2020 miracle) and the infinite power the Fed generally has to fight inflation, the market will obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity. 🚀

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. They don't need omnipotence or need to be perfect. They have ample room for error. Still, being somewhat precise with today's data capabilities is like what having omnipotence and being perfect would be in the 70s (when we last had an inflation problem).

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrums. Also as grandpa Buffett pointed out, Treasury rates are still at 0.0000% with oversubscribed offerings. The Fed doesn't have to raise much at all, so interest on US debt will not become a problem when they do. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.

TLDR: All the stonks that have crashed because the companies don't generate free cash flow will moon again. Market is about to do a headfake. MMs found a theme (inflation) to distract boomers (commodity futures) and retards (shit coins) together. Time to go full retard on beaten down stonks ($GME, $BB, $PLTR, $QS, etc.)."
2021-05-06 11:00:36,wallstreetbets,"Lmao bro I pretty much never browse wsb but you’re correct on this point. This a 1 sided game, always have been since fed was introduced, and now there’s more skin in the game than ever before so there’s a ton of motivation for asset prices to keep going up

You would be a genius if you would have bought lumber futures 10 months ago lol. If you are buying them now you are a fool"
2021-05-06 12:29:25,wallstreetbets,u had me at go full retard
2021-05-06 15:21:56,wallstreetbets,"When 10 rose to 1.7%, the tech stocks went down with fear. Now the rate came down to 1.5%, the high multiple sectors keep tumbling. All technical indicators point to more downside. If you look at the earnings so far, mostly good but sell off continued. I am afraid if the market loses the leadership (reopening stocks) which currently barely make the entire market break even this year, a bigger sell off will occur. Or a tiny signal from FED will just trigger more sell off. I struggle to understand how this downtrend can bottom."
2021-05-06 01:59:29,wallstreetbets,This all assumes stability for the other two legs of the stool. A wobble elsewhere in the country or world and the infinite power is vapor ware. 2022 elections are a gay bear hair away and power shifts with a lie about an election.
2021-05-06 09:29:19,wallstreetbets,So r u saying - long growth like ARKK & short value/inflation bets like XLE?

2021-05-06 08:56:40,wallstreetbets,You can post this same tune over and over in as many subs as you want. It won't stop the coming crash.
2021-05-06 10:25:39,wallstreetbets,I think you got it backwards but not necessarily wrong. It looks more like the market does what it wants and jpow reacts to that. He doesn’t seem to intervene unless he’s scared. All time highs won’t make him scared.
2021-05-06 16:29:49,wallstreetbets,"The Fed put is still in place. So, the only way the market can crash is if there's another COVID-like shock. The fear of the Fed being forced to tighten is BS as I explained above."
2021-05-06 02:07:37,wallstreetbets,Be more specific. The risks you pointed out seem deflationary.
2021-05-06 09:54:29,wallstreetbets,"Just long ARKK, or long both. Stonks will go up."

2021-05-06 07:43:56,wallstreetbets,I wonder if these are reviewed or even drafted by a person prior to being sent. I would bet these letters have ramped up considerably thanks to Vlad. You should frame this.
2021-05-06 07:45:44,wallstreetbets,Need to frame this.

2021-05-06 08:02:41,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the lolz this morning.
2021-05-06 08:05:44,wallstreetbets,Yes. The answer is yes. Man this whole taking pride in losing thousands upon thousands of dollars is exactly what makes WSB such a questionable subreddit.... I almost drank the coolaid but these posts sure helped make sure I did not. The fact that even posting this message will get me tons of hate is just a cherry on top to prove it
2021-05-06 08:06:22,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂
2021-05-06 08:07:12,wallstreetbets,LMAO I love it. Congrats!
2021-05-06 08:08:02,wallstreetbets,They are worried about you. How nice.....

2021-05-06 08:33:10,wallstreetbets,Bold of them to assume we can read that
2021-05-06 08:35:32,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity is NOT a good place to do business. You can have millions with them, and you have to go through the stupid phone thing to get to anyone at all. It can take hours."

2021-05-06 08:47:55,wallstreetbets,Lol.. they prefer loosing the money for you..! So have them manage it for you for a fee if they can guarantee you you won't lose any dosh..!
2021-05-06 08:48:19,wallstreetbets,"I remember when Robinhood used to send me these,  it read like this:

""There are three kinds of people. Those who can count and those who cannot.

""An investor to his advisor: Is really all my money gone? No, of course not. It’s just with somebody else!

""My wife’s purse was stolen the other day.It had all her credit cards in it. I was going to report it but the thief was spending less than she was!

Please reverse then at your earliest possible convenience.

2021-05-06 09:25:12,wallstreetbets,"“...because Fidelity does not provide investment guidance....” 

Isn’t this whole letter a “guidance”?  Dumbassess"
2021-05-06 09:26:42,wallstreetbets,Mofos. They care.   Hahah

2021-05-06 09:28:59,wallstreetbets,"TBF, that depends on the total amount in the account. Losing 10k on a 200k account is completely different from losing 10k on a 20k account."

2021-05-06 09:40:04,wallstreetbets,Maybe its because im poor but if i lost 10k id be suicidal.
2021-05-06 09:41:31,wallstreetbets,Jokes on them for sending a letter to someone who can't even read.
2021-05-06 09:42:45,wallstreetbets,That signature looks like a 2nd grader trying to write what they think cursive looks like

Do they reimburse you? Lol"

Btw what did you invest in?"
2021-05-06 13:00:54,wallstreetbets,I got one asking if I know about something called exit strategy. Strategy is to buy the dips! It's right here in white crayon.

2021-05-06 14:12:58,wallstreetbets,"Quote “if we do not hear from you. Fidelity will assume that you are comfortable with and responsible for the trading activity in your account”

Sounds like you better get in touch with them. I assume when you do they will immediately take responsibility for this loss & reimburse you accordingly."
2021-05-06 14:15:14,wallstreetbets,Did you write them one back that looks like it was done by a kindergartner?  You might want to have a little kid write back a reply just to fuck with them.  Get the kids to draw apes and diamonds and shit on it too before you mail it.😂🤣

2021-05-06 16:14:31,wallstreetbets,They love the trading.  They also don't want everyone going broke because that would end the trading.

2021-05-06 17:21:29,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity asked me who they should contact if I go looney as I set up the account.

I figured they had figured me out before I even logged in the first time.

So I see your “lots of trades“ letter and raise you a “we say him coming“ questionnaire."
2021-05-06 17:21:49,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, this stuff helps my investing so much.  Bought $500 of call today and they are already worthless and I don't care because it was a good bet."

2021-05-06 05:33:37,wallstreetbets,Where does it say you’re retarded?  You made me read the whole letter.
2021-05-06 02:22:21,wallstreetbets,Maybe percent of account matters?  This is like a 40% loss for me.
2021-05-06 04:43:13,wallstreetbets,Might be the number of trades too.
2021-05-06 06:18:19,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking the same, if it’s a letter at $10k, what do you get a 20, 30. 
When do get the Casio watch?"
2021-05-06 12:23:41,wallstreetbets,"Depends on your profile and % loss I think.  I got mine years ago.  I ignored it, upped my profile risk level, and added cash to the account.  That's when they realized I'm autistic and never bothered me again."
2021-05-06 13:16:45,wallstreetbets,Just buy index ETF's. Boring and not sexy but it beats the vast bulk of everyone playing the investment game. Getting rich quickly is the minority of the traders out there. Time and compounding is the only way to go to assure more ups than downs.
2021-05-06 07:41:12,wallstreetbets,They must've already confirmed your apehood at that point 🤣🦧🦍🦍🦍
2021-05-06 08:55:16,wallstreetbets,Maybe it’s based on % of account lost that sends red flags and they just send $amount in the letter because it’s easier for us to wrap our heads around
2021-05-06 09:47:56,wallstreetbets,When they ask you your investment goals and you choose 'capital appreciation' or 'capital preservation' as opposed to 'speculation' as your objectives when creating your account or trying to upgrade I think you're more likely to get stuck in their filter and wind up having them try to contact you.
2021-05-06 10:06:39,wallstreetbets,Well I lost 35k before on options on tesla. lol It was around that going private time. lol opps But still we had most of our liquid portfolio was in tesla stock so came out the other side ok. But I should have got a letter too. :)
2021-05-06 10:07:52,wallstreetbets,They know you have enouth gme shares to fill your loses so they dont massage you
2021-05-06 10:50:14,wallstreetbets,Well at that point they don’t need to ask if you’re retarded. They already know you are
2021-05-06 10:54:32,wallstreetbets,Most likely.
2021-05-06 11:10:13,wallstreetbets,"That’s probably it, they see you more as a lost cause."
2021-05-06 11:24:39,wallstreetbets,Maybe they already know you are retarded so they don't want to waste paper and postage?

2021-05-06 08:54:51,wallstreetbets,"yeah I think so, make 1 bad trade that costs you a lot doesn't necessarily mean you need to re-evaluate what you're doing. Making 48 bad trades that cost you almost half your account is going to raise some eyebrows."

why no loss post?"
2021-05-06 09:02:01,wallstreetbets,50k to 10k without options? that's almost impressive
2021-05-06 09:52:25,wallstreetbets,"10 >> 50 >> 10

No loss.

What do you want? A letter because you traded?"

Impressive."
2021-05-06 09:15:01,wallstreetbets,"well you see, this letter is asking him if he's retarded, they didn't have to send you a letter because they already know"
2021-05-06 09:16:46,wallstreetbets,"So its actually a combination of a bunch of things, but what it most comes down to is that stupid questionnaire you filled out when you opened the account.

If they see a big change in activity, like going from passive index investing to YOLO MU 60C (old ref I know) in 2 days and you suffer a lot of losses, they'll probably send you a letter like that to make sure they'll not have a lawsuit in their hands."

2021-05-06 16:32:50,wallstreetbets,what's an exit strategy?
2021-05-06 12:30:11,wallstreetbets,"so if you buy say 100 shares of stock A at $1000 and sell when it drops to $100

Then you buy stock 100 shares of stock A at $90 and sell when it goes to  $400.  you would then incur the loss for that year right?  Or does it incur a wash sale?  i'm confused when the wash sale rule kicks in."
2021-05-06 13:14:58,wallstreetbets,Wash sales render losses on the stock or similar non deductible. So youre gonna have to run the totals urself adjusting those losses from your later gains. Noteable that if you continue to lose those are also not deductible. So unless youre sure you can make gains bigger than your losses then stay out for a month to avoid the wash.
2021-05-06 12:48:44,wallstreetbets,"I'm honestly not the person to ask on this, because all of my stock purchases have been buy and hold. But, I do believe yes, that is how it works. I don't know anything about wash sales. Sorry."
2021-05-06 18:46:23,wallstreetbets,"Increases cost basis on the later buy, so you technically have a loss of 590/share still. Then depending if you rebuy again, you either kick the can further down or claim the remaining loss then."
2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Upcoming UWMC Earnings in Relation to LDI & RKT: Calls on UWMC Puts on Ramen??? You guys might remember me, as I have been writing a series of updating DD on this stock. The last one I wrote was being removed by automod constantly (too many links maybe?) so i just posted it elsewhere. Regardless, this is my last one, as earnings are finally going to be here on Monday.

So, before I begin, I would like us to give a moment of silence for our Rocket bag holder friends. Requiescat in pace you poor apes. If you need some help for your shell shock, or someone to blame, I direct you to the CEO of UWMC. He may, or may not, have taken Rocket to the back and beat the living \*\*\*\* out of it. Took a shotgun to their kneecaps. Bent Rocket over his knee and given it a spanking.

Let us be clear that this dude just Arminius’d (Of Teutoburg Forest) Rocket. Dan Gilbert probably called up Varus and delivered a “Jay Farnery, GIVE ME BACK MY WHOLESALE CHANNEL.” Or, you know, Thermoplylaed him, except if the Spartans had won right at the pass instead of a few months later.

Okay, memes aside, let us get to the deets.

UWMC Share Structure:

\- Class A Shares of which there is a dividend of 40 cents a share per year. Represents 6% of the Company and is in the public float.

\- Class D shares with 10 votes per each share, but no dividend. However, the Class D shares are capped at 79 Percent Voting Rights. Which means that the Class A shares represent 21% voting rights.

LDI Highlights:

\- Spent 200 Million on a special dividend of .69, and announced they were very likely to give a .08 cent quarterly dividend starting in Q2. They issued senior bond notes at 6.25% to fund this, as well as other things.

\- Stock price was up as much as 7.5 percent before market open, and then tanked.

Starting with UWMC & Increasing their Capacity

\- AMC Changes. Adding 50-100 more AMCs in the next 30-60 Days to increase time to close even further. Also encouraging the best AMCs to choose UWMC, by raising the benefits for Appraisers by increasing their benefits. Watch the Fastbreak video to find out how.

\- Manufactured Home Loans – Not Available at UWM on Conventional and Government Loans (Competitively priced).

\- Prime Jumbo Expansion – Raised Max limit to 3Million, allowed RSU income, and more such as only one appraisal to 1 Million. à These are being serviced directly by UWMC so they have a lot of flexibility on them. (They relaunched it on March 17th, and are already making it a better offering)

\- Lowered their FHA minimum score to 620 on Government Loans, among a few other changes.

\- ARMS are back. 5-, 7-, and 10-year rates. They can save 5/8th of a rate at the 7 year ARM. Sharp pricing. Adds options to brokers. 7 Tear one is good for refinance candidates according to the CEO.

\- Prime Jumbo 30 Year Released. These ones are not going to be serviced by UWMC but will instead be sold on. Their offering better pricing than their portfolio prime jumbo. However, guidelines and matrix are slightly tighter.

o But the portfolio prime jumbo regular program is going to have over 2 billion in May alone.  They are the only ones who have a product where they retain their jumbos.

\- Ultimate Submissions – Using 6-8 of these will. Goanna cut 3.5 off the CTC process, and also shave 1 day off your processor touch.

UWMC Estimated Loan Volume for Q1 and Estimated forward guidance for Q2

\- UWMC had closed Loan volume of 54.7 Billion in Q4 2020, with a gain margin of 3.05%.

o RKT barely met expectations which it had set for closed loan volume, and missed revenue and EPS estimates, which is unacceptable considering that every other mortgage company (Redwood Trust, LDI) that has reported has beat it out of the park. LDI beat EPS by 73.03% and beat Revenue by 30.38% for example. They also announced a special dividend of .69 and announced they are looking to set a dividend of 8 cents a quarter starting in Q2 of 2021.

o RKT gain on sale margin reduced from 2.57% to 1.93% on their partner network for Q1 2021. Please note that this is not the wholesale channel completely as their two primary partnership types are marketing and influencer.

§ This represents a 24.9% decrease in gain on sale margin from Q4 2020, or 249 Basis Points.

o LDI’s partner channel gain on sale margin decreased from 2.58% to 1.85%. That is a 28.2% or 282 Basis Point Decrease.

o LDI’s Partner Channel is through the whole sale channel, and through Joint Venture’s with Home Builders. However, the actual volume remains unmoved. Rate locks decreased from last quarter. It stood at 9.645 last quarter, but only 8.688 this quarter. While Loan Originations only increased from 7,730,101 to 8,051,362. We can assume this was largely off their Joint Venture with Home Builders.

\- UWMC is expecting Closed Loan Volume of between $52 and $57 Billion for Q1 2021.

o On CNBC their CEO stated they were right in the middle, however the April bump in refinance activity and purchase activity as rates eased down back under 3% likely gave them the boost they needed.

o Reopening the spigot on Jumbo Loans and FHA loans (while ensuring a fantastic Q2) will help raise closed loan volume for Q1 2021 as Jumbo only accounted for 583,299 in 2020 but 3,570,520 for 2019.

§ They are increasing their capacity and driving more wholesale brokerage business to them as a percentage of that wholesale broker’s business by expanding their Jumbo Offerings and increasing capacity, while making them more attractive. You should see strong tailwinds for Q2 2021 which has been talked about by UWMC’s CEO.

o Reopening the spigot on FHA loans will create a lot of closed loan volume as FY 2019 was 13,151,943 but FY 2020 was only 8,619,874.

§ They are increasing their capacity and driving more wholesale brokerage business to them as a percentage of that wholesale broker’s business by expanding their FHA Offerings and increasing capacity, while making them more attractive. You should see strong tailwinds for Q2 2021 which has been talked about by UWM’s CEO.

\- Capacity, and options for wholesale mortgage brokers are opening. The CEO of UWMC has been very big on this, and we can start seeing the fruits of this in Q2 2021. I don’t expect closed loan volume for any of the new offerings from the last week or this week to impact Q1 2021, but I do expect closed loan volume to be impacted very positively for Q2 2021.

\- UWMC is expecting a gain margin of 200-220 BPS or 2%-2.20%.

o However, a 24.9% decrease in gain on sale margin means a 2.29% Gain on Sale margin. Which means a 9 Basis Point beat. If, like LDI, there is margin expansion due to UWMC’s tech then this could mean even more of a margin gain.

o A 28.2% gain on sale margin decrease leads to a 2.19% gain on sale margin for Q1 2021. However, please note that UWMC’s tech could lead to margin expansion.

o I believe UWMC will fall roughly to 2.50-2.60%, but we will see on the 10th After Market. I do not mind a margin hit for market share gain, so long as that market share gain is sustainable OR the market share gain leads to revenue that offsets the gain on sale margin.

\- If LDI had no, or little, marketing expenses it would have had higher net income than Q4 2020. Rocket’s marketing expenses totaled 320 Million. They have such high marketing expenses because they are retail, whereas UWMC is wholly wholesale and thus their marketing costs are much, much, less.

\- Rocket got clobbered on their wholesale channel after UWMC’s ultimatum. The Wholesale Channel was one of their main growth drivers, especially in the purchase channel where they are exceptionally weak. (11 percent refinance, but only 3 percent of the purchase volume in the US).

o The Partner Network for Q1 2021 only provided 40.7B in originations (Please remember that this is not just wholesale but wholesale comprises a portion). Last Quarter the Partner Channel provided 37.9B in originations. That was a 7.3% increase, which is negligible when you consider that they probably only grew from their referral channel and from the increased percentage of their business that those who did not sign the addendum from UWMC gave.  You cannot have that when your direct-to-consumer channel decreased from 67.8B to 65B. Especially when your retail channel is the higher margin channel. Net revenue obviously decreased in their partner network from Q4 2020.

§ I cannot reiterate how bad this is for Rocket considering their aggressive growth was coming from this area. Especially since the broker channel surpassed 20 percent this year according to AMCs for the first time since 2008. It’s indicating to me that UWMC has won the broker war here, to be quite blunt, especially since UWMC’s CEO keeps reiterating that he has over 10,000 Brokerages partnered with him.

\- RKT gave disappointing Q2 guidance with a significant decrease in closed loan volume of between 82.5 Billion and 87.5 Billion. Gain on sale margins of 2.65% to 2.95%.

o Quite frankly, considering UWMC has stated that Q2 is going to be very, very, good… I am concerned for Rocket, especially since there is a government program coming online this summer that will help low credit score and low-income people refinance which UWMC is taking advantage of. Furthermore, the wholesale broker channel is increasing, and more and more housing inventory is coming online. Lastly, home prices are increasing. If UWMC has a revenue beat and closed loan volume beat like LDI, or even meets Q1 on the higher end and guides upward for Q2, that means that Rocket is likely capped on the wholesale channel and thus in the purchase segment and that UJWMC is gaining ground.

My Thoughts Going into Earnings

Quite frankly, I am positively inclined. Which makes you all think I am a moron most likely. Well, in a vacuum, yes, it would be a moronic play. However, the market’s priced UWMC to fail partly because it is a mortgage company, partly because of the uncertainty with Rocket, and partly because it does not believe UWMC can beat expectations.

Let us first look at P/E Ratio. Rocket had a P/E of roughly 13-13.5, whereas UWMC has a P/E ratio of 6.27 if the 1.22 FY 2020 is right. Financial Services company have a P/E Ratio of 8-10. While Rocket is the number 1 mortgage lender (with some arguing it was even worthy of tech valuation???), UWMC is the number 1 mortgage lender in the wholesale space. However, the market was looking for Rocket to completely outperform like other stocks and for guidance to be spectacular, much like other companies. The Market is looking at UWMC like it is going to fail, as it is falling below even the most conservative ratio for a financial services company and has been trending downward in the leadup to earnings.

Another bearish sign from the market is the short interest of UWMC compared to RKT. RKT’s short interest is 7.87% since April 15 (April 30th SI data should be released any day now). For UWMC it is 13.10% of the float, and I am guessing it is going to show an increase on the 30th. Volume for UWMC is also significantly low from its average.

Which leads me to my next point. I believe in war you must strike fast, and strike hard, which UWMC did. However, markets do not like uncertainty, and the ultimatum that UJWMC gave introduced a lot of uncertainty. However, UWMC has made a lot of positive noises before Rocket’s earnings, and so I was comfortable that they were winning the wholesale mortgage market war. I also quite thoroughly enjoyed their share raising moves, and their willingness to raise capacity. I did not really see that with Rocket. However, Rocket had its buyback program whereas UWMC did not have that to fall to and it led to a negative feedback loop for UWMC where people gave up, short selling occurred, and there were not really any buybacks that UWMC could do as opposed to RKT to halt the bleeding. Ultimately, RKT’s earnings even led to a sympathy bleeding on UWMC in the After Hours. UWMC is down 1.79% to 7.66 after RKT’s earnings, even though these two companies are diametrically opposed, and the success of one boded ill for the other.

The first positive thing is that analysts’ earnings are primed to be blown out of the water for Q1 and FY 2021 as well as FY 2022. Q1 2021 has analysts expecting .42 or .47 depending on where you look, but I think that is a bit low. Especially when compared to Redwood Trust and LDI. I’m positively inclined here.

Furthermore, LDI used 200 Million to give a .69 Special Dividend, but the stock was trading over 20-22 dollars at the time, and its announcement of a Q2 dividend announcement of 8 cents a share was unappealing considering the share price. At the current share price of 18.11 LDI would give a 1.7% annual dividend. At the current share price LoanDepot is giving a 3.81% special dividend. Compare that to UWMC which is offering a dividend yield of 5.22%, and who has announced that they were looking at a special dividend, increased dividend, or even buybacks in Q4 2020 to reward shareholders if there was excess cash. After LDI and RKT both issued a special dividend, I feel UWMC will have no choice but to do so, and a special dividend of 200 Million to Class A shares equates to 4 dollars roughly. Even if Class D shares were involved, a 40-cent special dividend to both Class D and A shares would only cost 640 million.  However, I believe that the owner wants to keep as much money in the company as possible because he wants to invest it in the company which is why Class D shares do not have a dividend, but Class A shares do. If you are still unconvinced, I believe a timely look at RKT’s special dividend is in order as they issued the special dividend to only Class A shares (Public shares and not owner shares), and not the Class D shares that Dan Gilbert owns. This structure also allows an outsized special dividend.

I have 7.50 call Options with an average premium of 1.20. This would cost 123 million if issued to only Class A shares. In a vacuum, to profit I would only need a special dividend of $1.20, though this will not be in a vacuum. A special dividend that large would force people to cover if they are shorting, for one, and this special dividend would be issued under the auspices of Russell inclusion in late June, A strong Q1 and a very strong Q2 Guidance. Furthermore, as the normal dividend is announced the share price would elevate by that amount, before falling after the ex-dividend date. If the share price instead falls or remains flat, I can exercise my shares and take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity.

Mortgage Servicing Rights alone can service the dividend (41.5 Million per year), and the interest on the bonds (80 Million), while also allowing the company to further invest or allocate to bond principal. The Senior Notes are themselves easily repaid.

Ultimately, I have 4525 shares of UWMC that I have been continuously adding to, and I have 25 7.5 Calls for May 21 at an average of 1.20 that I have also been adding to including the last 2 days for both calls and shares. I am looking to add a call, and perhaps a tad more shares to UWMC. Yes, I am aware of IV Crush, and of Theta Decay. The theta decay stands at 1.9% which is acceptable to me, and I believe considering the confluence of events, the positive noises that the CEO has made for Q2 2021, the short interest, and the strong downward pressure on UWMC indicating the market believes the company will completely miss earnings, as well as the overt indication and peer pressure to issue a special dividend will ensure that the IV will remain elevated after earnings. I would not advise this for the faint of hearts, or if you have a kid on the way and life savings to burn, but this is one of the few times where buying calls from theta gang might mean they cry, and you fly (upward). With that said, be aware of IV Crush and be aware that I have allocated 3,127$ and might up this to 3,200 roughly considering Rocket’s earnings. I have nearly 40,000 in UWMC, so this is by no means a majority position. Furthermore, I am somewhat cushioned as this is not a weekly. To be clear, this is a YOLO, but a conservative one (sans the options). I also have money in my bank, so it is not like this will render me homeless.

I am not a financial advisor. Do what you will with this information.

I look forward to the earnings call on the 11th.

Big Update: The Dividend now stands at roughly 5.7%, and has a standalone p/e ratio of 17.5 which is equivalent to BAC. The Forward P/E at an analyst estimate of 1.22 is 5.73 for FY 2021 and a little lower for FY 2022. I believe that 2021 will have at minimum a EPS of 1.5, and so that gives a forward P/E of 4.67 for FY 21. "

hear me out you future rich ballers.

A new stock has just popped out in the market. It is Sky Water Technology and they are a semiconductor manufacturer who focus on wafering and making chips advancements. They have been in the chip industry since 2006 so not a brand new play in anyway but they just recently went public at $14 per share. 

so before I dive into the good shit, let’s go back and talk about the cons of this stock for all the haters out there:

- IPO just came out; not any balance sheet for public  
- Chips which are made are 200-300nm; this is what intel made back in 1993 and now they make 10nm
- Company is running is not a profitable company 

Okay now let’s talk about why this is a good speculative play:

- Brand new foundry made in Minneapolis to build chips 
- revenue growing each year
- ONLY COMPANY ADVANCED ENOUGH TO MAKE CHIPS FOR THE ARMY (in order to make chips for the Army, you need to be a U.S Based foundry which $SKYT is)  
- Got a contract to experiment with radiant resistance chips for department of defense warheads
- Shortage in Chip Industry has been a stagnant issue and will raise the price. 

$SKYT to me is something worth above $30+ and i personally have skin in the game so i believe that with government contracts, it can run up.

Trillions of cicadas from Brood X set to emerge

Sifting through a shovel load of dirt in a suburban backyard, Michael Raupp and Paula Shrewsbury find their quarry: a cicada nymph.

And then another. And another. And four more.

In maybe a third of a square foot of dirt, the University of Maryland entomologists find at least seven cicadas — a rate just shy of a million per acre. A nearby yard yielded a rate closer to 1.5 million.

And there's much more afoot. Trillions of the red-eyed black bugs are coming, scientists say.

Within days, a couple of weeks at most, the cicadas of Brood X (the X is the Roman numeral for 10) will emerge after 17 years underground. There are many broods of periodic cicadas that appear on rigid schedules in different years, but this is one of the largest and most noticeable. They'll be in 15 states from Indiana to Georgia to New York; they're coming out now in mass numbers in Tennessee and North Carolina.

When the entire brood emerges, backyards can look like undulating waves, and the bug chorus is lawnmower loud.

T he cicadas will mostly come out at dusk to try to avoid everything that wants to eat them, squiggling out of holes in the ground. They'll try to climb up trees or anything vertical, including Raupp and Shrewsbury. Once off the ground, they shed their skins and try to survive that vulnerable stage before they become dinner to a host of critters including ants, birds, dogs, cats and Raupp.

It's one of nature's weirdest events, featuring sex, a race against death, evolution and what can sound like a bad science-fiction movie soundtrack.

""You've got a creature that spends 17 years in a COVID-like existence, isolated underground sucking on plant sap, right? In the 17th year these teenagers are going to come out of the earth by the billions if not trillions. They're going to try to best everything on the planet that wants to eat them during this critical period of the nighttime when they're just trying to grow up, they're just trying to be adults, shed that skin, get their wings, go up into the treetops, escape their predators,"" he says.

""Once in the treetops, hey, it's all going to be about romance. It's only the males that sing. It's going to be a big boy band up there as the males try to woo those females, try to convince that special someone that she should be the mother of his nymphs. He's going to perform, sing songs. If she likes it, she's going to click her wings. They're going to have some wild sex in the treetop.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$GM DD: The long-standing engine of the American empire will drive the future **Overview**

EDIT 2: position= 56 shares at $53

I'd say the majority of you apes are unaware, but American relic, GM, just released its earnings this morning and 'bullish' doesn't even begin to describe the results. While the financial figures were encouraging, with strong increases in margins carrying a lower-than-expected revenue to beat EPS expectations, it was the qualitative unveilings that I believe were of the most significance here in terms of our ability to start to imagine the GM that we will have ten years from now.

&#x200B;

**Numbers**

Like I mentioned above, I'm not going to dive hugely into the numbers here, but I will provide an overview of some factors that I found interesting/important.

Despite narrowly failing to meet revenue expectations, recording 32.47 billion vs. the expected 32.67 billion, GM managed to knock analysts' earnings per share estimates out of the park generating $2.25/share against the predicted $1.04.

This is largely in thanks to really positive improvements in margins across the board, with Q1 2021 vs Q4 2020 figures as follows:

Gross margin: 11.22% up from 7.96%

Operating margin: 10.09% up from 7.38%

Net margin: 9.31% up from 7.59%

According to CEO Mary Barra, these margin improvements were put down to a strong performance in GM's finance product segment (a segment with lower overheads than manufacturing, etc), the leverage of virtual engineering programs and other software solutions to refine engineering and prototype manufacturing processes, and strong sales figures for GM's higher-margin SUVs and Pickups.

Perhaps most importantly here, GM maintains its initial guidance for this year and is confident that it will not be further impacted by the semiconductor shortage that has seen the auto-sector reeling lately. They predict EBIT of $10-11 billion for this year (strongly beating annual EBIT from 2018 through to 2020), despite the prolonged semiconductor shortage's impact on manufacturing.

Also of note, but to a lesser extent, is that the company has reduced its total liabilities, marginally improved its cash position, and reduced its interest costs, all while increasing its total inventory.

&#x200B;

**Words**

Put it simply, GM appears to be positioning itself at the leading edge of mainstream America's EV adoption and will be a powerhouse in the EV industry globally for decades to come. Tesla makes incredible products and probably deserves the hype, but GM has the scale, infrastructure, and history to truly make its rollout impactful.

The company is quickly positioning itself as vertically integrated, after having invested heavily in battery research, design, and manufacturing capabilities. GM's scientists have developed battery technology that can deliver 450 miles per full charge and performance of 0-60mph in 3 seconds while allowing for flexible design considerations that can be adapted for the needs of each vehicle. These statistics will only improve.

GM's scientists and engineers were able to quickly adapt to the semiconductor shortage by developing new workarounds involving less rare semis or to find new solutions to old problems which in some cases have subverted the need to use semis in these cases. In my opinion, this is indicative of a high-performing engineering crew who promise to continue to be adaptable as the company moves forward into new ground.

In regards to upcoming models which are scheduled for release in 2022/23, Barra states-

""The initial interest has been overwhelming, especially from commercial and ***government*** customers. We gave a small number of them a sneak peek at the interior and exterior design. They said it exceeded their high expectations with zero emissions, long range, pickup capability, innovative storage and strong value along with a powerful design.""

The keyword here is 'government'. The Biden administration pledged in January to replace the entire US federal government's vehicle fleet with EVs- [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-autos-idUSKBN29U2LW](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-autos-idUSKBN29U2LW)

While there is no guarantee of agreement in place that GM will be the company that meets this demand, the replacement fleet will consist of 650,000 EVs at a possible cost of over $20 billion. Obviously, the administration will want to spend this money domestically, and GM will be a front-runner for these contracts. If GM even takes in 20% of this amount, they will be able to significantly reduce long-term debt (thereby reducing operating costs moving forward and increasing margins), accelerate their investments into new ventures, or simply add the profit to their books.

Other bullish signs include:

\- GM's Cruise venture, which is set to deploy 4,000 autonomous taxis to Dubai by 2030

\-GM is developing 2 EV models for Honda which will be produced in North America. This means GM will be paid to manufacture vehicles sold at Honda's expense.

\- Brightdrop, their electric delivery company which is at the forefront of operations ready to address a $6 billion market by 2030

&#x200B;

Here is a link to a DCF model which I've been maintaining for GM. I use 2021 EBIT guidance, and GM's Q4 2020 guidance for future growth in the years moving forward. I assume an improvement in gross margin over past years, but lower than the impressive Q1 2021 figures. Applying a 5% discount rate, the model returns a per-share price target of $117.24, and applying a 6% discount rate, we see an $82.47 target.

Hope some of y'all find this useful. Please drop some feedback or corrections if I've gone wrong here and I'll look at making amendments to this DD or the model.

2021-05-06 19:05:14,wallstreetbets,"Hey GM long term is great. But current price with forecasted limitations on production is going to see some pullback.

I work in the automotive industry and a lot of GM stores don't expect to see units for 18 months. That's if they turn around production ASAP. I got a dealer buddy with usually 200 cars on lot looking at 35 with only 10 inbound this month and no promises next month....

I'm short term bearish. Long term bullish. Currently in 2023 37P but those will print before January and then this puppy will fly again once production worries ease up.

Not advise, just my take."
2021-05-05 23:34:32,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the heads up. What’s the deal?
2021-05-06 00:47:21,wallstreetbets,Position added. Won’t do a TLDR
2021-05-06 19:53:30,wallstreetbets,Thanks for  the informative post. Waiting to buy GM on a pullback in June / July

2021-05-06 00:18:51,wallstreetbets,"I know.  I've only posted my message twice (I think), but I think OP's DD really should be seen by a wider audience.  I know you can filter by DD, and that hasn't been overrun so much, but anyone that doesn't sort will never see this."
2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"👀👑 Opportunity in SKLZ - Hear Me Out 🚨UPDATE: FREE float being gobbled up by Cathie every day and multiple catalysts in Cathie speaking about SKLZ At 3 Pm On CNBC today as well as jobs data disappointment and plummet in yields. Today could potentially be a BIG squeeze day... 

ORIGINAL POST: 

Whether you are a short term trader or a long term investor, I believe there is a huge opportunity in $SKLZ. 

💵 🚀 🚀 For Short Term Traders: 

1. Short volume ratio was ~54% as of today and short volume was ~33% 

2. Cathie Wood has bought &gt;6 million shares in the last 48 hours, which invites hedge funds to short heavily

3. ER was a fantastic catalyst yesterday, with a beat on revenue, a raise on full year guidance, the addition of executives from Airbnb and Beats, 95% gross profit margins, and 83% YOY paying user growth - shorts still won the fight even though it started green today, ending another ~10% down

4. SKLZ is down ~70% from its high in February 

This is the perfect short squeeze candidate in my opinion, with the fundamentals to back it as a long term growth play. Retail loves it, Cathie loves it, and funds love to short it. 

✅ 💪🏼For Growth Investors: 

1. SKLZ is the Shopify of mobile gaming. Both are PLATFORM providers for small developers. However, SKLZ provides a platform that allows any game developer to host real time multiplayer cash competitions. Skillz is able to have 95% gross profit margins because they have no game development costs. 

2. Mobile game developers are incentivized to partner with Skillz not only because of their 2.7 million monthly active users and growing... but because users on Skillz games are more than EIGHT TIMES MORE LIKELY to pay than they would be for an in app purchase. On average, 17% of Skillz games users pay to play. The average deposit is over $10.30. 

3. SKLZ issued upped full year guidance of 375 million, however, they noted they are EXTREMELY frugal with this. The chance of a HUGE beat on this guidance is very high. The following were left out of revenue projections: 
-Expansion to India in Q3 of this year (Indian mobile gaming market is growing twice as fast as the US and is much larger to begin with. US is only 10%)
-Tetris and Big Buck Hunter being added to the platform, as well as several additional games with synchronous tournaments being tested
-Monetization of non-paying players through ads etc beginning Q3
-The sale of the huge trove of customer data Skillz has acquired, beginning in Q3
......... ADDITIONALLY: Next year’s revenue guidance has not been updated but was originally pegged at 560 million, WITHOUT any of the above catalysts. 

4. Skillz plans to expand to several additional countries in 2022, which alone could quadruple revenues by 2023E 

5. Management plans to partner with exercise companies such as peloton and first person shooter games to allow for real-time competition where Skillz takes a 15% cut of all entry fees. Remember, regardless of who wins a match, Skillz will take 15% of the entry fees. Peloton has specifically been mentioned numerous times by the CEO in interviews. Imagine versing someone through their app and the fastest time wins the payout. Battle royal games in the near future are also a market they are expanding into according to the earnings report. 

6. Look at how Shopify grew over a 5 year time horizon. The chart was also ugly to start and people didn’t understand the small developers e-commerce offering just as they don’t understand Skillz. Most funds and analysts still think Skillz makes games, while they only provide a platform. However, in the future they could make some of their own like Netflix does. 

7. Skillz recently partnered with the NFL for a competition to have a game developer make a viral NFL game that will be cross-marketed by the NFL and Skillz. This submission period ends in May and we can see something by the beginning of next year, and marketing later this year as well as a beta version. Expect tons of additional partnerships to roll out, as SKILLZ will likely partner with additional sports organizations and potentially gambling platforms such as DKNG (shared SPAC management team brought them both forward). 

8. 618 million in cash on the balance sheet with ZERO debt and tons of postings on their website looking for strategy analysts with M&amp;A and investment banking experience. I believe they are looking to acquire heavily to grow their pretense internationally in the coming year. 

9. Players on average spend ~62 minutes per day playing Skillz games, which is more than the average time spent on Tiktok, Snapchat, Facebook, and Netflix. This is a metric well regarded and shared by management. 

Listen.... SKLZ is not for the faint of heart, but I strongly and truly believe, in 5 years, THIS can be the next Shopify. I am simply here to let you know why I believe in it. Both short and long term. Fck the tutes who have manipulated the chart, and much love to Cathie and the retail that have diamond hands 💎 🙌🏻"

His Airbnb experience and relationships are critical for expansion overseas including India (speaking as a native). His ability to make deals with local authorities/brands/businesses in the past and also go to market effectively is going be very valuable, and translates well to helping skillz integrate with the Indian game developer and player communities. Bullish."

2021-05-06 07:44:28,wallstreetbets,"Before all the ""look at his post history!"" replies - yes, this is my first post. I've been an anonymous lurker on reddit for the better part of a decade, finally made an account a few months ago so I could upvote / downvote things, but have never quite gotten the nerve to say anything, largely because of the ""look at his post history!"" replies and because I never felt I had something valuable enough to say or the time to write it up (that should change - if I take then I should give as well).

As many introverts are; I'm good with numbers. I've methodically slightly beaten the market for years - staying cautious and diversified, avoiding big losses but avoiding big wins as well. After taking a big chunk of that and putting it into my own company, I decided to finally make a big bet. I was highly intrigued by SKLZ when it first shot up to $30+. It had a great growth story and a huge market opportunity. It seemed high risk / high reward, but not purely speculation - it had big backing from Cathie Wood, Motley Fool, Morgan Stanley, etc. Still, I thought the price was too high and couldn't bring myself to jump in. And honestly I don't care for the company name. 

Also no, the games aren't great (yet). As a gamer myself, they're definitely not something I'd sit around at home playing in my spare time. But that's not the target market. Mobile gaming is largely about people (mostly non hardcore games - a bigger market) pulling out their phone as a short distraction at a bus stop, waiting in line for lunch, procrastinating at work, etc. These are things that are going to increase as the world opens back up. And things like Candy Crush and Words with Friends weren't huge because of their impressive graphics or complex gameplay - they were huge because they were addictive, competitive, and simple enough for anyone to play. 

After the initial surge in Skillz price came insider selling, a secondary offering, and short reports. To me the short reports had some valid points, but were grossly exaggerated and misunderstood the business. The insider selling - well, if I manage to take my company public at that valuation you sure as hell better believe I'm cashing in 10% of my hard work to get some financial security for my family and not be 99.99% all in on one thing. That was perfectly reasonable to me and company leadership is still heavily invested in the company. The secondary offering was very poorly timed, but did provide them with the cash necessary to put out big marketing campaigns and draw in new users. 

The price plummeted and seemed to stabilize at around $18. The price was right for me, and I went nearly all in on 100 December $15 calls (tried to post position, but comment wouldn't go through with the image). Then I watched in horror as the shorts relentlessly pushed it down to $13, then watched in relief as it shot back up to $21. Then the short attacks started again. Even after great ER (for an early stage high growth company) they continued. AH it dropped 8% before numbers even came out, then after release went to +5%, then the next day back down 9%. The price action has been completely absurd, clearly manipulated, and has caused me to pretty well lose hope in a system that allows this to happen to a promising company while CumRocket shoots up like 4000%. 

I'm not asking for any help with my bags. That's been another hesitation of mine in ever posting anything - the fear that I would cause someone to make a poor decision and lose big money. So please understand that this is still high risk, but both the short term and long term opportunities are there as the OP laid out so well. If they weren't, I'd unload my bags and at least put them somewhere else. But at this point it's also about more than the loss to me - I'm furious at a system that allows this to continuously happen and want to see it burnt to the ground piece by piece. 

And yes, I saw where CNBC mentioned it could be a WSB target while WSB was clearly focused on MVIS. But just because CNBC was wrong there, or is usually wrong, or is probably even oftentimes intentionally wrong, doesn't mean that anything they even mention is a bad company. This is a huge opportunity, and one that could absolutely squeeze hard. No, it's not the next GME and is unlikely to get squeezed to $100+ - the float is too high. But it could easily go 2X - 3X if there's enough volume to trigger it."

2021-05-06 12:23:16,wallstreetbets,"not sure if it's obvious but to mess with short sellers, you have to make your shares unavailable to them by putting them up for sale with a sell order.  Set a high sale price some days long into the future.

If you dont do this your broker is likely lending your shares out to be shorted and you are helping them.

Gotta take the shares out of circulation!

They updated there guidence by 6m, hardly s growth company.


They've been caught red handed round tripping revenue and the CEO on the call yesterday was extremely shady about it

India and NFL will not recognize revenue for atleast a year. Are you forgetting how long a mobile game takes?


How about the risk of being banned from the app stores? Surely having a warning like this isn't a good for a mobile developer

2021-05-05 22:59:54,wallstreetbets,"Except “round tripping” revenue is a COMPLETE fabrication, they use the same revenue accounting method as Uber, Lyft, DraftKings, etc. promotional revenue is counted as full revenue and filtered out by the time it hits profits. Ex. McDonald’s offers a buy one get one free coupon for a burger - this is counted as revenue but the additional burger comes out in marketing costs, the same as for SKLZ. Additionally, they refuted the short report saying they were off by a factor of THREE TIMES in how much of their revenue comes from “bonus cash”. Secondly, at NO point did the company state that revenue for India or the NFL game will only be recognized next year. In fact, India expansion revenue can VERY well be recognized this year, and nfl game revenue is likely by Q1 of next year with beta revenue later this year. This isn’t an MMORPG... these games are generally developed in less than a year and developers entering the competition likely already have game stencils they will simply modify. The brother thing is just a joke that Wolfpack research tried to take the stock down with.... what does a family squabble have to do with a stock’s inherent value? His brother wanted to sell those shares which were not rightfully his. He got them back into the hands of the company."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Lots of technical analysis charts (TSLA, AMD, PTON, WDC, CAT, GLD, SPY, etc) Just a quick note so you may understand the various lines better. White lines are trendlines. Orange scribbles are used to indicate Inv H&S or H&S peaks. The bottom indicator is called Ultimate RSI which is basically RSI but with Bollinger bands. IDK what the red and green dots are, they seem to give pretty shit signals so just ignore them. The blue line on the ultimate RSI indicator is the actual RSI reading. The rest of the lines are moving averages.

&#x200B;

**AMD:** Looks like a big ass head and shoulders pattern with the lines I have drawn as support resistance. I expect a lot of chop here. If AMD follows through with the head and shoulders, I think $63 is possible. Break through the bottom yellow line (73) would indicate head and shoulders in play. However, it is in an uptrend channel so as long as it follows the channel trendlines, it's still bullish.

[AMD on daily](https://preview.redd.it/cfp2j6g2mex61.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f76b6cbcce4a10b944b03fa6de817690fde1995)

&#x200B;

**WDC:** As of [Burry's last 13F filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), he held WDC and it looks like it's been consolidating for a big move. There seems to be bearish RSI divergence (yellow line on the RSI indicator) which is a bearish sign.

[WDC on daily](https://preview.redd.it/r38vk2zylex61.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=423b0e722f24001fb77f7f19d46752a1b52d8deb)

&#x200B;

**CAT:** This just broke out today from either a triangle or a bull flag. The earnings call was good but puked it but ever since people have been bidding it back up which is definitely bullish IMO. There does seem to be bearish RSI divergence but volume is a better indicator and the volume here is green after earnings as opposed to sell volume on WDC. 

[CAT on daily](https://preview.redd.it/xczrj64vlex61.png?width=1577&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bb250e5cad95f524937522a624402bc859b7784)

&#x200B;

**PTON:** Pretty obvious head and shoulders, earnings are tomorrow so that could be interesting. They just said they're halting treadmill production cause of deaths also.

[PTON on daily](https://preview.redd.it/ysdu4iailex61.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9a32de96c56b8b5bc7995af60f7b878d309da9a)

&#x200B;

**TSLA:** Forming a big ass triangle which IMO is bearish. Burry is short TSLA and I'm not about to bet against Burry. Tesla is a cult stock though so it's got a huge following and I wouldn't be surprised if by some miracle it keeps going higher. 

[TSLA on daily](https://preview.redd.it/i1mrg7dumex61.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=949eebdd959858ce335855472257cb7095ded7c9)

&#x200B;

**QQQ:** QQQ has lost most of it's steam along with a lot of the hype stocks. It did bounce off of this trendline yesterday and closed near it today. Break below could get interesting. Momentum seems to be dead in QQQ.

[QQQ 2H chart](https://preview.redd.it/t68amy8foex61.png?width=1574&format=png&auto=webp&s=739d8af6f37c05c7bf351e2451d414b3461d8cbb)

&#x200B;

**IWM:** IWM also looks toppy as strength seems to be fading from tech and non-profitable companies. Looks like some form of a head and shoulders although I can't say for certain where the neckline is. IMO, if IWM breaks and starts to bleed, it will have a lot of major effects in the market. Reason is that a lot of retail is holding stock in the overvalued companies that are in the Russel 2K. Same for QQQ and tech. If retail starts to feel fear and they start selling en masse, it could get ugly. But for now, IWM seems to be in an uptrend for the past month. 

[IWM 2H chart](https://preview.redd.it/usq4ir8soex61.png?width=1573&format=png&auto=webp&s=92fca7e31d87d9596f7b11f0832d2aa3900be492)

&#x200B;

**DIA:** Like the other indices, the Dow is also in a period of consolidation but it appears to have broken above today and retested the previous resistance. IMO, this could be a result of sector rotation into ""safer"" stocks. 

[The Dow on 2H](https://preview.redd.it/uhoi9anxpex61.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=67e179ea1cf3062f57b38cda8b7dcc8ac08c03f0)

&#x200B;

**SPY:**  Most heavily traded ETF and most popular derivative of the S&P 500, SPY is also in a zone of consolidation. Break below would get ugly, break above would be the Fed continuing to go BRRRR. That being said, there does appear to be some bearish RSI divergence on SPY. 

[SPY 2H](https://preview.redd.it/lksypnxnqex61.png?width=1574&format=png&auto=webp&s=07f5537167f83fe17bb91855b953b8d3e627b618)

&#x200B;

**GDX:** GDX is gold miners. GDX failed to follow through with the head and shoulders and instead broke out of a bull flag. Gold will follow the miners so this is bullish for gold.

[GDX 2H](https://preview.redd.it/6ubcrwy3rex61.png?width=1582&format=png&auto=webp&s=88336d52c31ac409eadef7788c8c8d8b70abf412)

&#x200B;

**GLD:** Last but not least, gold. Gold appears to be in the midst of a cup and handle that's been 7 years in the making. If GDX goes higher and GLD follows, this is gonna be a nasty play. That being said, since the time frame for the pattern to form has taken 7 years and the candles are weekly, it wouldn't be a massive gain in a short period of time. It would be a much longer long. GLD is currently retesting the handle resistance which is now support. 

[GLD 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/c5djlqjlrex61.png?width=1573&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8d42be0095a2317ee7b8a9c89cb62d9d80b1905)

That's great that you think 10 million is the floor, but if you invested your minimum wage paycheck to buy 2 shares, don't sit on a five million dollar payday because ""/u/lordandsaviordiamondhands said it's 100% going higher than that!"" You set your own floor. You hold until YOUR price is right and you sell when it makes sense for you. If you want to be greedy, go work for a hedge fund. If you want to change the world, start by changing yours.

Multiple mods of multiple subreddits are being put up on pedestals like they're some kind of almighty figure with perfect morals that would never do anything to harm another person. Guess what? All of these people... are PEOPLE! Behind every screenname is a flawed human being. Everyone has a vice or a soft spot, something that can compromise them. I keep seeing ""WSB IS COMPROMISED!"" You're goddamn right it's compromised. WALLSTREETBETS IS NOT YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR! This is a collection of degenerates making thousand dollar trades and posting loss porn as a joke. If you were taking financial advice from this sub, you're not an investor. If some other subreddit is saying ""we'll tell you when the top hits"" or ""we've got a plan to communicate when the shit hits the fan,"" then I've got a bridge to sell you. 

I keep seeing ""just don't dance"" and then half the posts are practically doing end zone dances before you've even hit the goal line. Yeah, the world is a fucked up place and greedy people are winning, but spending $200 on a stock doesn't entitle you to never working again. If you think that putting some money in the stock market means you're entitled to a beach house and a lambo, you're not going to change the world. You're becoming just like the people you claim to hate.

2021-05-06 02:05:25,wallstreetbets,"I don't. No one knows how high this will go, including OP. If someone can only scrounge up the money for 2 shares they have done so taking their own measured risk and of course they decide for themselves when to sell. As do we all. OP is saying no one tells you when to sell, but the post is caked in subtext convincing you to sell earlier than you intend to, whatever price that may be. I personally didn't throw my money into GME to triple it, or to buy a new car. If someone can only afford $200 on GME it's up to them if they want to hold to $10m per share and count on all apes being greedy enough to do the same. They aren't going to lose that $200 because it can't go to $0 and they will get by without whatever unrealized losses they might incur in the same way they always get by. Making sacrifices to survive financially is a skill the unwealthy are accustomed to.

IMO someone who scraped up money to get themselves a small stake in the game would be making a huge mistake *not* holding until it is life-changing money. Otherwise what is the point? Do you really think they got into this to help cover half of next month's rent?

The price is going to explode. There will be plenty of time for people to find the exit of their choosing. Nobody who has shares at this moment is going to be left holding the bag. It's not going to suddenly drop back down to $500 out of nowhere, screwing you into only getting %150 profits.

Apes are not a collection of degenerates out to screw everyone else over. Maybe the OG WSB members did that, but the additional 7m are apes are holding against HFs, not each other. It's the HFs who will be buying the stock back at unprecedentedly high prices. Not people here who already have a stake in the game. The MOASS will take days *at least* so sell when you want, but live with the regret of selling early if you do. This whole ordeal has been beyond ridiculous. When margin call happens, remember all the fuckery you have witnessed since January. Would this all have happened if the price was only going to reach $1000 per share? I don't think so, but y'all can think for yourselves.

GME is trading at 2.15 EV/Sales while GPS is trading at .8 EV/Sales.  If it's such a value play why is Gamestop trading at a higher value than the Gap?  


Depsite all the conspiracy theories, in the next 2-3 months you will see the short interest updated, the ownership %age updated, and it will be much different compared to your made up values.  It'll be interesting to see how you all reconcile your preconceived notions to reality.

I really hope you don’t believe that, but considering that you implied that all the HF are on the other side rather than making money on the way up and down you probably do.


Just so you understand, it’s possible that even the worst short position bought puts the first time it hit almost 500, then sold calls at 40, then puts again at 400.  That’s a profitable trade that exceeds the loss even if they still hold the original short"
2021-05-06 02:32:51,wallstreetbets,"I hold GME and I'm not telling anyone to sell before they're ready. First off, if my little rant can persuade you to do anything, this isn't the place for you. Second, I mean exactly the opposite of what you think. You shouldn't sell before your plan, but you shouldn't follow someone else's plan or wait longer than you're comfortable. We've had hodlers from South America post that 1 share was a month's wages. For some people, 50k is life changing and for some, it isn't. I don't need 10mil/share to change my life. My ""life changing amount"" is somewhere in the middle. I'm sorry I won't be riding the rocket ship to 10 mil."
2021-05-06 03:15:59,wallstreetbets,"Reality check, people like Dave Lauer (ex-Citadel HFT engineer) and Susanne Trimbath who have worked with hedge funds have explained in depth how a ridiculous amount of aspects of the stock market can be used to manipulate the price and more. Isn't Beta a reflection of past trends? How can it predict which way stocks will go in the future? Beta was at such a negative value because GME was doing well while the rest of the market crashed. No one can explain why that particular event happened. For all you know Citadel liquidated all their S&P positions to short GME. 

Comparing the value to the Gap? Why the gap lmao. Did they just get an entire new board of execs, pay off their debt, and begin to orchestrate their plan of a massive company turnaround to revolutionize their company in order to be relevant and more succesful in the future?

There is DD that goes way down the rabbit hole, but if those are proven wrong that still doesn't mean shorts have already covered. However, if proven right it means they have to cover even more. Yes, I'm ready to be convinced I'm wrong because I said goodbye to my money each time I bought more shares. If I'm right though and the MOASS does happen, the potential rewards are incomparable to the losses."

2021-05-06 03:01:15,wallstreetbets,"Lol you're not persuading me to do anything. Like I said, everyone took their calculated risk at their entry points and can exit whenever they want. It's cool if you don't want to hold to $10m. Personally I'd leave at least one share just in case it does go higher, but you do you. Either way if people own more than one share they should sell it in stages, same as they should with every other stock. Especially since in this situation people holding their shares longer makes the price go higher and no one here is going to be left holding the bag."
2021-05-06 03:34:06,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your first paragraph, but it seems that so many people believe that if the market is going to crash, they will be safe with GME because of it's negative beta.  That may have been true in the past, because GME rising was causing a selloff of stocks, because whoever was shorting wasn't hedged, but now knowing the consequences, they would have changed their positioning so they would be hedged now.   How many of those GME holders know the difference between a stock that has a negative beta at a certain point in time to those that think they will be able to use GME as a hedge against a stock market dip now?  


And I also agree that we can't be certain that the shorts haven't covered, but to me it seems very unlikely.  And I'm sure that's where we'll ultimately disagree.  If GME drops to the point where I consider it a value stock again, I'll buy back in.  But at this point, it's all guesswork.  I'd like to see GME make definite strides in profitability, acquisitions to make it more relevant, and ways to make use of their retail space (that branches out from games sales).  


I wish you the best of luck, and hope like hell it squeezes to your target price.  I sold when I saw the SEC start making noises about it the first time around, bought back in on the dip, and sold again when I thought it broke a technical support line.    


Right now, it's in no man's land for me."

2021-05-06 12:15:03,wallstreetbets,"Which is why I added the second part.  Even the worst short could now be profitable.  So since even the worst trade could be profitable, it isn’t a guarantee that a net short position exists to push up above 150.  If the expected reason for another squeeze is well the original short at 10 still needs to cover it is probably a mistaken premise."

2021-05-06 11:50:17,wallstreetbets,"Fundamentally, you are investing in this country’s national security. Like it or not, we benefit as a whole if we are secure. The world outside is not all rainbows and hugs. Never will be. Their product has indirectly saved my life when I served overseas (OIF 08-09). For this alone, I’m a long time investor and grateful. Shorting this stock for gain is as unpatriotic as it gets. Follow the money trail, someone wants them to fail, but ask yourself why? 

From a pragmatic point of view, total national defense spending is in excess of $1T per year when factor in ancillary spending outside of the defense budget. Factor in growing threat from an emerging superpower the defense spend will only grow. Also, take in consideration that they aggressively moving into the private sector space. Many retired general officers end up on Board of Director positions which they use their leverage and relationships and in turn provides more opportunities for $PLTR. Palantir would be wise to start hiring more retired GOs and place them on their BODs. 

Finally, this like any company with a unique product will take time to appreciate and UNDERSTAND. I’m not betting on exponential growth over the 1-2 years, but rather a solid company that will be in the 100-200 range in 7-10 years. 

Other factors may accelerate their growth which would include another large scale war taking place every 10-12 years. Look at the last 100 years and this trend holds up. You want a company like Palantir on our side. In fact you want big tech on our side but they choose not too. Which ultimately just means more market share for $PLTR. 

That said, you got to have the stomach and financial wherewithal to be a long term investor. 

Good luck to everyone.

2021-05-05 20:48:47,wallstreetbets,Here’s free advice just from looking at the price action and news (has none). Fundamentals-It’s performing overall worse than $SPX since it dipped end of March. Why did it tank end of March bc it had a double top at $28.93. It’s below all SMA. ITS NOT GOING UP anytime soon unless some strong positive news comes out
2021-05-05 20:43:06,wallstreetbets,Idiots like you just don’t get it. Stop wasting people’s time
2021-05-05 21:01:10,wallstreetbets,Thanks for sharing helpful information. The reason I posted here is because earnings of IQ is 5/18 and IQ dropped to $14.15 2 weeks ago and went up to $16 last week. I just wanted opinions from experience people here.
2021-05-05 21:12:17,wallstreetbets,"$14.04 is past support back in 4/21. I see it going down to anywhere between 14.04-14.11 forming a double bottom before it goes back up, and if it does it will have some strong levels of resistance ($14.32) to break through"
2021-05-05 21:23:43,wallstreetbets,"Based on your knowledge and experience, do you think IQ will go up like it did last week in next 3 days? All I need is IQ to go to $14.75 so I can sell my contracts and not lose any money"
2021-05-05 21:33:18,wallstreetbets,"**IMO** i think it will go down before it goes back up. If it goes to around $14.11 and then bounces up it will need some good news to break $14.32 resistance level, if it does break 14.32 you are more likely for it to hit your target.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ASO technical breakout and DD good evening apes, fellow smooth brains

first off, this is not some shill FUD bs to distract you from our real fight, only an opportunity to make some quick tendies TOMORROW. I am a long time lurker and GME holder (80 at $154.18) but felt the need to share this idea.

To Begin:

shares of ASO traded 8% higher today after Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV) reported EPS of .90 vs. expected .50. YES, almost double the expectation for Q1. Shares of BGFV had a 31% gain today.

based of this we can expect, at MINIMUM, some sort of EPS beat for ASO when they report later this month.

Looking at the chart for ASO, we see that it has been trading sideways and bull-flagging nicely on the 180 day chart. With the news of BGFV's earnings beat, ASO broke out of consolidation on high volume and closed today at $33.29, just shy of ATH at $34.13.

5.5 million shares were traded today compared to an avg daily volume of 1.84 million. This is further confirmation of the breakout.

&#x200B;

[ASO from end of march 2021 to today](https://preview.redd.it/uprn5ij95ex61.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=f43254643682500f401f3280cc40c41d1eb17020)

ASO chart from 3/19 to present day. (breakout)

Because we are literally at ATH's, anyone short the stock is or will soon be in the red and looking to cover that position before they become a GME style fuck up.

ASO has 30% short interest. Feel free to confirm here or anywhere else.

[https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

On top of that, in my smooth brained opinion, ASO is still FAR undervalued at this level, even undervalued at $40.

Doing some simple P/E comparison with Dick's sporting goods (DKS) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) we see that.

ASO PE = 9.2; DKS PE = 15.02, HIBB PE = 18.49.

Now I'm no good at math so ill leave the calculations up to you, but a PE of maybe 12 still give us an upside of nearly 33% from currently levels, or a share price of roughly $45.

Tomorrow I fully expect ASO to at least test ATH at $34.18 and if we break above we could easily see a mini squeeze pushing the price higher potentially to $40.

Play: Throw this on your watchlist and set an alert at $34.18 then buy shares or 35c's.

Position:

TLDR: ASO go up tmrw

Edit 1: Thank you kind Apes for my very first awards! :P

Edit 2: u/robot-legs commented that ASO released an 8k and S1 for earlier this week including preliminary sales up nearly 38%. Keep in mind, this could change before official earnings but is an amazing piece of information. here is the link  [https://fintel.io/doc/sec-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-8k-2021-may-03-18750-588](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-8k-2021-may-03-18750-588) 

Edit 3: We are up 3% in premarket so far😁"
2021-05-05 22:33:17,wallstreetbets,"Just an FYI ASO released a 8k and S1 earlier this week that flew majorly under the radar. It was a preliminary Q1 sales report, sales increased 38%. I believe their estimates were around 25%. Im thinking we see some adjusted outlooks and price targets shortly.

2021-05-05 22:57:17,wallstreetbets,Do you think their share offering and concurrent repurchase is already priced in?
2021-05-06 03:35:14,wallstreetbets,"So do we thing that bow they announced that the offering is at 32, are we going back to 32?"
2021-05-05 20:40:07,wallstreetbets,"Nice catch my fellow ape!! This has been on my watch for two weeks now with the nice looking chart setup.

**Also, calls only go to 45c, this could easily gamma squeeze and short squeeze at the same time just like GME did back in Jan.** As we inch closer to the 5/21 exp, calls become cheaper (they already are pretty cheap, seeing IV is only at 100% for OTM calls after today's run up). With such a low P/E ratio, great earnings from Big 5 Sporting Goods, super high 30% SI (anything over 20% is huge) and it breaking out of it's 22 day consolidation in the $30 range and reaching ATHs, this thing is ready to explode. Ready for tomorrow's big leg up!"
2021-05-06 09:28:19,wallstreetbets,Is it happening
2021-05-05 20:19:22,wallstreetbets,GReat DD APE!
2021-05-05 21:13:17,wallstreetbets,IV spiked on my calls in the last 5-10 mins before close. 🤔🤔
2021-05-05 23:10:44,wallstreetbets,I hope you're right. My issue is everything seems to tank even with good earnings lately.
2021-05-05 21:22:16,wallstreetbets,"I'm bullish as fuck on ASO, but you have your facts all fucked up.

First of all, ASO is extremely undervalued still.  That part is 100% true.

The short interest is not in the 30% range.  This figure is not up to date.  KKR has been selling off their ownership, in January, March, and another block just a few days ago.  They're considered share offerings, and while they're not dilutive, they are expanding the float. The only reason this WAS a crowded short was because KKR only sold brough like 25% of the shares to the market for the IPO.  I would guess that they own 55-60% now.  

Go look at their BBIO ownership, which was another portfolio company they brought public in 2020, and which they've slowly divested.  They don't intend to keep holding, and they have to slowly work out of it.  They'll keep selling when it spikes -- i.e. IF a short squeeze occurs, they'll take the tendies while you diamond hand your shit, and they'll kill the momentum.  Their job is to make money, not help you.

Beyond that, I guarantee you that shorts spent time covering after earnings basically confirmed the company is on the right track, and again today when big Five showed the industry is still on fire.  There's no money to be made shorting ASO, so unlike GME, there's not really a good reason for new shorts to replace old ones.

The short squeeze thesis is dead.

However!  This is still going to 40-45 by EOY.  In my opinion."
2021-05-05 20:30:40,wallstreetbets,Why the rocket at 34.18 I’m kind of stupid
2021-05-06 11:55:21,wallstreetbets,just bought calls and shares.  no brainer
2021-05-06 19:15:37,wallstreetbets,"Well shorts fucked us up again, My calls were 380% up and only managed to sell for a 180% profit... It looks like it is going to consolidate for a while again, how long no one knows but it might run before earnings"
2021-05-05 22:39:11,wallstreetbets,Wow! That is incredible. Thank you for pointing that out. Great find.
2021-05-05 22:38:45,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the update.
2021-05-05 22:42:38,wallstreetbets,I added this to the post.
2021-05-05 23:07:03,wallstreetbets,"Direct market offering is now complete, just like GME did their direct market offering and no one even noticed the share price dipping. ASO will gap up tomorrow, be ready ape!!"
2021-05-05 23:00:10,wallstreetbets,"Its a good question. The share offering put a stop to the last breakout at the end of March or else I believe we would have hit 40+ back then. We consolidated for about a month while they sold off the shares at average price $32. To the best of my knowledge, that offering is priced in fully and this is a fresh breakout with renewed strength. (the chart and volume is proof of that)"
2021-05-05 20:43:03,wallstreetbets,Absolutely. Great point about the options. See you at 40 tomorrow😆
2021-05-06 09:54:32,wallstreetbets,"It's happening, VOL already more than daily vol and were only 24min in."
2021-05-06 12:09:56,wallstreetbets,Good start today. If price can hold steady we will probs see continuation tomorrow.
2021-05-05 22:03:51,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, APE!"
2021-05-05 23:47:41,wallstreetbets,"It was actually exponential through out the day, not just last minutes. MMs probably saw the order flow coming in thick, started to cover their asses in the options market before letting the stock loose through 32..."
2021-05-05 22:03:37,wallstreetbets,"Yessir, was watching that. MM's preparing for a bigger move potentially."
2021-05-05 22:00:50,wallstreetbets,"You bring up a very interesting point, however, I have been watching that short interest number on ASO daily for the past few weeks. On Friday, last week, it showed ASO was 44% short and actually updated on Monday this week to show 30%. I am not exactly sure how they calculate that number, and you are right, it could be wrong, but from my standpoint I believe a good portion somewhere around 20-30% is short. I will have to do more research on KRR so thanks for bringing that to my attention. Glad we can agree that it is fundamentally undervalued. Regardless if you or I are right about SI, the stock still broke out of a month long wedge and the price is nearing the top of of the options chain expiring 5/21. The potential for a gamma is there."
2021-05-05 20:36:21,wallstreetbets,That’s “technically” the ATH breakout and stocks love to run when they break ATH. also at that level lots of shorts will start covering.
2021-05-06 17:37:13,wallstreetbets,Did you see the volume spike right at close? About 46m worth. Wonder what that’ll do for the price tomorrow
2021-05-05 20:47:55,wallstreetbets,"40 should be quite easy, once we're there, 45 will be that much easier and MM's will have to delta hedge their calls by buying shares on the open market driving the price higher! In addition, as you stated, the short sellers will start covering their short positions and then we see the gamma and short squeeze occur. Aka rocket launch to the moon.

Call volume for 5/21 exploded today, over 13,000 35c / 9,000 40c / 3,100 45c were purchased - I'll see you on the moon!!"
2021-05-06 13:19:41,wallstreetbets,YOu fkin ape experts are so smart. $40 my ass. This thing is about to fkin tank. Thanks for the loss porn coming up
2021-05-06 10:43:35,wallstreetbets,What we saying? I’m still holding 35C that expire 5/21. Up ~100%
2021-05-05 22:15:09,wallstreetbets,"I really don't think so on that front either.  It's not that easy to create a Gamma squeeze.  Most calls are likely being sold as covered calls, either secured by shares or longer calls.  The premiums are really nice due to high IV (I have been selling them myself) There isn't so much open interest that it can be assumed that they're being sold naked.  And in effect, there's not that much Gamma exposure.

I'm not an expert on this by any means but smarter people have explained this part to me and I'm just trying to pass it along to you.

But the other thing. Again, is that KKR will blow up a rally before it becomes a squeeze as it suits their own interests to sell high.  They're not the diamond hands type."
2021-05-05 20:38:52,wallstreetbets,Ok thanks
2021-05-06 17:41:51,wallstreetbets,"I did, are you sure it wasn’t a glitch? Also, last time ASO broke out it had a day in between runs where it was only up about 1%. Wonder if today was that today and we continue tomorrow. Guess we will see."
2021-05-06 11:19:18,wallstreetbets,"Let her ride, I think we see more upside potential if SPY can go green or if we have a green/healthy day tomorrow."
2021-05-06 03:22:48,wallstreetbets,"KKR will not blow up the rally. Why sell at a reasonable market value of 50-100, when you can force a short squeeze single handedly and sell to the shorts forced to cover above 100... Like you said, they are in it to make money. KKR would benefit from a squeeze now. After all, they can sell at 50-100 within a year without the squeeze when ASO post a couple more Qs with raised guidance."
2021-05-05 22:30:14,wallstreetbets,"Great discussion on ASO.  I've been long since 2020 and think ASO is a great investment.   If some shorts get covered,  that would be a welcome boost to the share price."
2021-05-06 17:43:28,wallstreetbets,"Exactly what I was thinking too, kinda like last time it ran up. Who knows maybe tomorrow will be another 8% day. I took profits during the run up today and got back in right before close."
2021-05-06 11:01:26,wallstreetbets,"They've been selling.

And there's sort of a flaw in your thinking if you think that you should NOT sell when prices go up."
2021-05-05 22:37:11,wallstreetbets,"Definitely.  And comps in DKS and HIBB are only moving higher.  More earnings reports coming up in the sector that should put more proof in the pudding that sporting goods stores are still hot.  All will report before ASO which should be beneficial to us.  And ASO has advantages over others-- though the balance sheet is the worst of all the comps.

Aside from that, UnderArmour just reported strong earnings, as will all the other shoe and apparel companies.  Golf sales will he huge.  In short, everything they sell is reporting strong sales.

There's plenty of rally left to go.  But it will be organic, it doesn't need to be a short squeeze story."
2021-05-06 17:47:05,wallstreetbets,Good man. Never hurts to take profit. I sold 2 covered calls (35c) near the top but still have some extra shares waiting for 40ish.
2021-05-06 11:14:44,wallstreetbets,"Whatever, you keep telling people not to expect a squeeze... Your thinking is very clairvoyant. You must be eating psychic dicks. You know it all."
2021-05-06 14:18:44,wallstreetbets,When does ASO report earnings for q1 2021? I've been trying to find a date but no luck so far.
2021-05-06 17:50:25,wallstreetbets,Solid
2021-05-06 11:41:46,wallstreetbets,"Jesus christ lol, I'm giving you actual information rather than hopium bullshit."
2021-05-06 13:46:14,wallstreetbets,"Candle just turned red on the day.  You want some psychic dicks?  I trimmed my position at $36.40 and the high on the spike was $36.60.  

Also if you search your newsfeed on ASO you'll see a filing for a secondary offering of ASO stock by KKR filed late last night.

I love being so right about everything."
2021-05-06 14:57:43,wallstreetbets,They're on a funky schedule where their FYE is 1/30-- their 4Q 2020 numbers reported at end of March were Nov-Jan.  They'll report Q1 (Feb-April) probably at the end of June.
2021-05-06 14:18:07,wallstreetbets,Wow you are really special. KKR announced the SPO days go fucktard. Go tell those lies to your mom. She will really believe you trimmed your 5 shares right at the top.
2021-05-06 14:52:11,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I knew that, did you?  Because your dumb ass was arguing that they wouldn't sell.  While they're actively selling and doing so publicly.

You don't need to believe me, I wrote that they sold a few days ago yesterday before the press releases.  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5udz9/aso_technical_breakout_and_dd/gx3l22n?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3"

2021-05-05 22:55:24,wallstreetbets,"I think it's a very safe play, yes."
2021-05-05 20:08:40,wallstreetbets,"First one, Academy Sports. Most of you unwashed neckbeards probably haven't stepped foot in an Academy Sports store because it promotes doing things outdoors. You'd just waltz around feeling guilty for gaining another 40 pounds during Covid and purchase a DD sports bra for your ""girlfriend"" even though the cute cashier knows you reek of desperation, she can even smell it with her mask on. It's okay because your card is going to be declined and you'll shamefully walk out while the repulsed cashier attempts to scrub your Cheeto dust and dandruff from the nooks and crannies of the card reader.

Academy Sports is an American sporting goods store chain. We are all well aware of the effects that Covid had on retail during 2020 and know it's been a dumpster fire. Academy reported [earnings](https://investors.academy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/academy-sports-outdoors-announces-record-sales-and-earnings) on March 30th and somehow, these motherfuckers blew the roof off.

 • Fourth Quarter and Full Year Comparable Sales Increased 16.1%

 • Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Rate Expanded 420 basis points over Q4 2019

 • Full Year Net Income Increased 157.2% over 2019 to $308.8 million

How did they do it? I have no fucking clue. Their e-commerce sales increased by a cool and modest 60.7%. Where the fuck did this demand come from? Looks like you guys were sitting around in your moldy basements jerking off to some other retard's gain porn while too ashamed to post your loss porn, and Academy Sports was out there busting loads on faces and you just wait on your knees and take them to the forehead, eyes wide open. (Makes no sense, you sick fucks act like getting sperm in your eyes is something you can add to a resume since you ""watched a lot of kids"") Anyways, here's an [excerpt](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/30/academy-sports-and-outdoors-inc-aso-q4-2020-earnin/).

""While many of our categories benefited from the COVID-19 crisis, several of our key businesses such as licensed apparel, team sports equipment, apparel and footwear and back-to-school were adversely impacted and should return to normal this year. In addition to each of these businesses driving sales growth, they are all margin rate-accretive and should drive a return to a more traditional mix of sales. Fourth, we will improve our management of several seasonal categories where there are not worldwide inventory shortages, but where our initial inventory buy in 2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand. This year, we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line.

As we begin 2021, we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team, the continued development of our key initiatives, and the stronger, deeper relationships we have built with our customers. The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021. Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2% to down 2%. This is an 18% to 14% increase on a two year stacked basis.""

Okay great, so people bought a lot of workout equipment. Who cares? What you semen suckers fail to understand, is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids. Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can boink on the kitchen table again. Ding ding, those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind. Yes wow, vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins. Enter every single recreational sport available. Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see (this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it) we are obviously going into outdoor season. That means camping, vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do. Academy Sports has it all. Tents, grills, coolers, clothing, swimsuits, fishing gear, canoes, sleeping bags. Do me a favor, walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself.

I obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one. Show me another stock with a [100% buy rating](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ASO/price-target/) and if you're too lazy, type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself. Now I'm going to get into the most interesting part. ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts. blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet. It's kind of weird that it is 9th on the [most shorted stock list](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest) when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support. ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago. If I had a guess, it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn't deserve to be, and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it. Oops, it's too late now.

Dick's Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of [16%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/dks). Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33.62% and a PE ratio of 8. Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room. What could these large funds know that we don't? Hmmm.. let's try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer. (Does this remind you of anything else?) I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions. Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around $24.50 to around $32.00 and the price hasn't gone below $28.39. Also of note, the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1.584M. The entire float is [40,436,703](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest) shares with 33.62% of the float shorted, leaves you 13,594,583 shares short. That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so. Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself. To me, it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation. (Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from $32 to $35. If you're comparing companies in the same sector, who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on? Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019, 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio, or Dick's with 445M in 2019, 409M in 2020, or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former?

I already know you little ringholes get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it's up 150% for the week, but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3% for the week and up 10% for the month.

I do also want to give some credit to [/u/XionTG](https://www.reddit.com/u/XionTG/) for the predictions below that he made a month ago. They turned out to be spot on, even though he got a lot of flack in the comments.

Predictions:

My Target Prices

First short-term target price: $30 by 5/1

Second short-term target price: $60 by 7/1

(You can see his original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lxpagr/aso_dd_criminally_undervalued_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) but I will warn you degenerate retards that this DD is from the rinvesting crowd so don't pucker your asshole up too tight or your heads might explode and your balls could drop).

On 12/1/20, BGS added the iconic Crisco brand to its roster.

The pandemic put B&G's staples in the spotlight, and created a blockbuster year for BGS - with most Americans sheltering in place at home, and wary of empty grocery shelves, folks began buying BGS's products like never before.

However, with vaccination rates gaining steam, bears have been shorting BGS, figuring that its 2020 success was an outlier. According to Finviz, BGS currently has the biggest short float of ALL dividend stocks, running at 26.86%. 

At its 4/22/21 $30.39 closing price, BGS yields 6.25%, the highest dividend yield that we found in the packaged foods industry."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NSCC 002 Approved by SEC Yesterday. Why did no one mention that here? Seems Important *Correcting to NSCC_801 not 002.

The rule change allows the DTCC to ask for liquidity from its members (which includes pretty much any big money including the NASDAQ, NYSE, Citadel, etc.) everyday and intraday if they need to. Normally they could only do this once a month a few days before monthly options expired.

SEC approved the rule change yesterday. Entire market dropped a bit—were they testing their new liquidity rules? At the very least I think it helps explain some moves out of the stock market as rule changes can make people skeptical of what will happen. Just my two cents there—would love any other insight.

Link to SEC approving: https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an.htm#SR-NSCC-2021-801
Link to NSCC_801: https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf

2021-05-05 20:17:55,wallstreetbets,"Sure. Supplemental liquidity deposit ratio is changing from a 24 month look back of “peak activity” to a daily measure determined by trading and clearing activity. That means on most days DTCC will demand *less* collateral from clearing members, but on days with high level of activity it will demand *more.* Any of the larger members will not have issues when this gets implemented. And the deposits are really just protection against default risk between trade and settlement (hence they go up around options expiry or days of heightened trading activity)."
2021-05-06 10:32:03,wallstreetbets,What makes you say that 🐜💜🐜💜🐜
2021-05-05 20:58:21,wallstreetbets,"Nothing is changing about the 24 month lookback. The largest change is that the DTCC can request funds from members at any time rather than just once a month before options expire. That means the market should theoretically be smoother and less volatile around monthly option expiration. Is that not something relevant to bring up on a stock forum for discussion, especially on the day its being implemented? Imagine someone who solely trades monthly options. Pretty sure they’d want to know about this."

The entire market is priced as if it’s going to succeed. But we know that’s impossible, a lot of companies that were trash before the pandemic are still trash today. But in this mania they’ve all soared to new highs. People will slowly realize their holding trash and start dumping it. The institutions and banks already started this process, and they are doing it very fast. Retail is picking up the bag, that data is also available. 

It’s happening right in front of everyone but no one cares. If this doesn’t crash, we’re all screwed. Young people will not be able to accumulate wealth easily nor will they be able to afford homes. What a time to be alive!"

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD on AMD short position and Options Looking at the options and what the average they sold for, hedge funds are going to make approx 1B from Call options loosing value in May-July, Put options in the money and shorting the AMD stock. 

When looking at the short position 6-7% and the large number of Call options outstanding, would a price movement push a short squeeze ? 

I believe AMD is COILED to rebound, it needs a trigger. The trigger is the combination of

1. Short positions : 83M as of April 15th
2. CALL options above 78 strike expiring in May, June, July. 1,018,166 contracts = 100M shares. Net of Put options 65M.

AMD institutional ownership is 78% of the float 1.2B shares \*78% = 950M

Float is is 250M.

What if :

1. EVERY shareholder put A LIMIT SELL ORDER for $1000 for every share you own. To remove the ability of brokers to short sell or borrow the shares to fill call options.
2. Buy more shares and repeat step 1
3. Buy Call options.

The demand will increase the price, the limit sell orders will limit the supply.

The price is pushed down, as hedge funds sold a lot more call options than put options and they will loose a lot of money if the price goes higher than 78.5. The bulk of the contracts are between 80-120 strike.

If you consider options till the end of the year, the number is more than double that. 

Short position + Open interest in call options = low price. 

====

I am interested in hearing why wouldn't this work? 

What else can be done to get back at hedge funds who are playing these games?"
2021-05-05 20:50:31,wallstreetbets,This stock is primed and ready LFG. 🚀
2021-05-05 20:14:49,wallstreetbets,Amd is stuck until Xilinix merge is completed.  Don't expect a breakout.
2021-05-05 20:35:39,wallstreetbets,"What does that mean? 
Shareholders of both companies approved the deal.
The US regulators didn’t object during the allotted period.

We are technically waiting for China to approve the deal. Correct? 

But how does that contribute to lower share price. That is smoke and mirrors.

If you want to see how people move, look at how the are incentivize.

Hedge funds and market makers who sold call options and put options will make more than 1B over the next 2.5 months by shorting the stock and making the options worthless.

I don’t buy the closing the deal reason for a second. Both companies are on an upswing. Based on the revenue numbers for 2021 they are ahead by a year and a half from revenue and profitability. 

The stock is down, because people who sold 100M is call options above 78 and 35M of put options above 78 are making a killing by keeping the shares down."
2021-05-05 21:38:56,wallstreetbets,This is probably the only thing that makes sense . Amd will be 100+ just not until after the merger . Right now it will be from $75-$85 just floating
2021-05-06 10:55:29,wallstreetbets,"It still hasnt arbitraged yet. You can buy xilinx shares right now and basically get a free 10% when they convert to amd shares after the merger, as long as this delta still exists the price wont increase significantly. After the delta has been closed the stock might move but the delta probably wont close until the risk of the merger failing approaches 0. That risk approaching 0 won't happen until close to the end of the year. Trying to fight hedge funds on this is stupid because what they are doing actually makes fundamental sense. TL;DR the hedge fund managers have a strategy that basically gives them free money, us trying to stick it to them is just going to give them more free money."

If people are liking the stock together, who cares about the “logic” (even before WSB became the crayon standard, the market behaved irrationally (unless you knew big wigs were on the same page and all moves were designed to screw retail)). Plus I think the memes are more effective.

We need more MNMD memes. Lots of pent up like the stock factor."

2021-05-06 07:30:59,wallstreetbets,"The last three days Iv seen Benzinga trying to push some coin that has no value to the blockchain ecosystem & is saying ""WSB Mod making a blockchain app"" or some shit. didnt this happen before and a bunch of people got scammed? this coin seems shady imo.

Its like an activist coin ""To fight for a free market"" type shit & thats it, thats the coin.. it serves no other purpose so I dont suppose anybody would go for it but if a mod would care to elaborate then please do..

Also WSB doesnt support discussions about crypto so why would a mod make a coin & also how did Benzinga get this information?"

2021-05-06 02:42:37,wallstreetbets,I dont know when you turned off the bots but I'm noticing all of a sudden that there are tons of GME posts and all the recent pump and dumps are nowhere to be seen. While I'm biased towards GME it does appear something in the bot is heavily weighted towards removing GME posts despite them being legitimate and not rule breaking far as I can tell. Does that line up with the mechanics at work?

If your flair doesn't fit its purpose then it doesn't pass? A meme quota? A discussion regulation where if it's not a new topic or doesn't fit a time threshold it doesn't get past?

Like if you picked up the textbook from the CIA and flipped open the first fucking chapter. There's an intro about how rad overthrowing countries is. And then there's the first paragraph that just describes ""how awesome and effective it is to install puppets in positions of power""

Honest to god I'm just a skeptic by nature, but I think it's pretty interesting (read: funny) how many folks simply took the re-opening of the mod team post-coup at face value. Like after witnessing all of that, you're just sitting there nodding your head like ""yup, all good now""???  


If the powers that be are capable of executing the coup in the first place, and there's SO LITTLE in place on reddit, or this sub, to counteract corruption, you think they're incapable of paying those people off and putting them back in after a nice little ""we're serious"" time-out? C'mon man. You act like you know the people you tag there personally and can vouch for their character. It's the fookin internet mate, they don't give a fuck about you and frankly there's literally nothing keeping them from taking a cash handout and telling you otherwise.

Then the admins stepped in, took out Jartek and his followers, and instated /u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR as the head mod. 

For a while zjz wasn't allowed back in as a mod by the admins, something to do with a whistleblower policy, but enough public outcry got zjz back into the mod spot, but he was far down on the mod list. A few days ago the mods did a reshuffle to put zjz back near the top of the mod list, but because reddit is reddit, the only way to do that was to mass kick and reinvite mods and ensure they accept in the right order. 

So no, this is not some grand conscpiracy to replace the mod team - as you can see in the image on *this very thread,* the vast majority of the mod team is identical to how it was before the reshuffle, plus the addition of a discord moderator, two alt accounts, and apparently a reddit admin

Even if these accounts were somehow corrupt - they are below the moderators who have been around for years and can get removed by the mods above them."

I'll tell you three things though that can all be backed by easily accessible data. Volume is drying up, its getting lower and lower, breaking its own records. The actual float that isn't held by insiders is somewhere around 26 mil according to gamestop itself. Combine that with the fact there were days when 130 mil shares were traded while noone was selling according to on balance volume and its nigh impossible there aren't millions of synthetic shares. Lastly Bloomberg itself has reported greater than 100% institutional ownership. Not including retail. Even if that data is old the holdings of those institutions hasn't been changed enough to warrant a refiling.

The house is sold before its even got a foundation , just a stick with a lot number and that thing is sold.

But yeah regardless of how fast unbuilt houses are selling, supply will never catch up to meet the origination levels that RKT wants to reach, and if interest rates do go up, the refi aspect of RKT's business will diminish as well. Which is why they are putting guidance out there hinting at a significantly smaller loan book in Q2. I had big hopes myself for earnings and lost like 10% of my portfolio. But just saying that I think it will be wise to get out sooner rather than later if one does not want to be holding the bag for the long term.

Same material that OSB is made of I-joist is partly made of in spans of like 50+ feet.  Just doesn't seem to add up. It takes on average 300+ sheets of OSB for a medium sized house (sheathing/roofing). Even subfloor that is a thicker product made in the same way.  So its a needed commodity.  Supply and demand if you catch my drift (i.e. jack that price up make to make more money cause people need it) But also shipping is a huge issue due to the lack of truckers on the road and fuel prices. Don't see the prices dropping until the contractors do. Just my personal DD on the building market based on true experience of my general area surroundings.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD $VVNT (Vivint Smart Home) - An ex-SPAC That Got Thrown Out With the Bathwater *Disclaimer: I have a long position in VVNT.  This is not financial advice, and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post.  I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions.  I am not receiving any compensation for it.  I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.*

&#x200B;

**Intro:**

I want to bring your attention to Vivint Smart Home ($VVNT).  The stock has been getting absolutely hammered year-to-date (around -50%) because it was spun out of a former SPAC, and everyone is selling SPACs now.  While some SPACs (and resultant companies) are insanely stupid, this one is not. It now trades at $10.77 per share, which is barely off the price it listed at last year ($10, or 7.75x Adj. CY20 EV/EBITDA).  I think fair value today is more like $25 (10x Adj. CY22 EV/EBITDA), and has the potential to double or triple that over the next few years.  The cap is small ($2.5bn), the float is extremely low (20% of total), and short interest is around 5% (11 days to cover), meaning when the stock moves, the stock moves big.

&#x200B;

**Background and Market Overview:**

Vivint Smart Home is a player in the smart home industry.  They earn money on subscriptions (recurring revenue!) and equipment sales.  You may have seen one of their recent commercials with Snoop Dogg ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTnFHCNLrAE)).  It’s one of the most respected players in the industry, and is differentiated by handling the whole stack themselves (installation, technology, maintenance/services, etc., like an Apple product for smart homes).  In terms of competition, there isn’t anyone else that provides full-service, do-it-for-me (DIFM) installation for smart home technologies.  They obviously compete with DIY suppliers (Amazon, Google, Alarm.com), but in all likelihood market will move towards DIFM as the preferred solution as the technology becomes more complex and integrated. Other traditional security vendors are trying to break into the space (think ADT, which partnered with Google recently), but their solutions don’t appear to be as fully-integrated and comprehensive as Vivint’s.  This is an attractive market that Vivint has first-mover advantage in, and that is likely to take off over the next decade as IoT adoption accelerates.

&#x200B;

**Why was the Stock Trading at $10 after the SPAC, and Why is the Stock Stupid Cheap Today?**

**The 2020 SPAC and Solvency Risk:**

When the company de-SPAC’d in 2020, nobody had any clue if their business model transition would allow them to be solvent.  The company had been bleeding cash for years because they used to finance the smart home equipment themselves (and therefore had to raise debt on their own balance sheet).  In 2017-2018, with the help of Blackstone as their PE sponsor, they made a transition to allow the consumer to finance the equipment sale, and the financing company would give them the cash upfront.  Ever since, the company has been beating and generating lots of cash flow every quarter.  Solvency is no longer an issue.  I repeat, despite the negative shareholder’s equity (which Buffett admits is not that important), this company is no longer a going concern!

How the New Operating Model Revitalized its Unit Economics: The other concern regarding Vivint was that its operating model was just not that attractive.  At the time, subscriber acquisition costs (SAC) were way too high (due in large part because they had to finance the equipment for them).  So even though lifetime value (LTV) looked attractive, LTV/SAC looked weak.  Over the course of 2020, we saw the success of their new business model:  SAC per new subscriber fell -86%, from $1018 to $139!  Subscriber growth is now meaningfully accretive to the business.

**Isn’t the Smart Home Market Mature?** 

The home security market definitely is.  ADT hasn’t seen net subscriber growth in years.  It probably matured at around 25% penetration.  But what simpletons don’t realize is that security is just one vertical in the smart home market, which will all be consolidated into players like Vivint.  The smart home market is expected to grow almost 13% CAGR through 2025 to reach $47bn in the US.  And this company has only $1.3bn in revenue and 1.8mm subscribers!  Very underpenetrated.  And the CEO thinks household penetration can reach upwards of 80% over the next 5-10 years.  So we’re in the early innings.  After all, Vivint’s subscriber base has been growing high single digits for many years now, and next-year guidance reaffirms that this trend should remain in place. They are building the brand and they are growing.  And yet the company trades on the same multiple as ADT (which isn’t growing at all!) and Verizon/AT&T (which are also barely growing, and are exposed to a mature market with extreme competition).

**Adjacent Verticals Give Vivint Opportunities to Expand TAM:** 

In the same way Tesla is in a perfect position to sell auto insurance (given it has all the data on the driver), the same can be said for home insurance and Vivint. And similarly, Vivint is a prime candidate to enter the ageing-in-place market (i.e. smart home for old people who need monitoring).  While the insurance vertical is probably not too far away, there has been no commentary on when ageing-in-place business might take off.  But either way, the market currently gives no credit to Vivint for these potential adjacencies.  Big revenue and TAM expansion opportunities!

&#x200B;

**What About the Capital Structure?** 

It’s true that public float is low (20%) and Blackstone holds a huge ownership in the company, which risks them dumping it into the market.  But lockups expired a long time ago and Blackstone is holding on.  Some of the other venture funds have all reduced their positions now.  In addition, management has been buying in.  The negative shareholder’s equity and leverage are concerns, but given their new ability to generate and scale free cash flow, Vivint should have no trouble balancing investment and paying debt down.

&#x200B;

So why is the stock trading as if we never learned this information?  Because the market is freaking out.  And when the market is afraid, I’ll be buying."
2021-05-05 20:30:24,wallstreetbets,"I have a Vivint system, & if it wasnt such a pain in the ass to switch out to another company, I'd dump it.  Vivint removed the web based option to view & download clips; can only be done on smartphone, which doesnt work so great.  If they would quit wasting money on Snoop Dog, & fix their damn platform, it woud be great."

So what is this? Maybe it did squeeze, but wth is this new price? Something is seriously weird going on.

I’ve already pulled out my winnings during the squeeze and just playing with house money now. So now I’m a curiosity long term investor. I’m in for as long as the stock doesn’t move, because I refuse to believe it won’t move up or down in some way in the long run. If it goes down to 0, no harm done it was house money.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RKT Q1 2021 Earnings Report with 13F institutional short positions [https://s25.q4cdn.com/509921419/files/doc\_downloads/2021/05/1Q-RKT-Earnings-Release-FINAL-(updated-at-1p).pdf](https://s25.q4cdn.com/509921419/files/doc_downloads/2021/05/1Q-RKT-Earnings-Release-FINAL-(updated-at-1p).pdf)

quarterly net income increase from 140,000,000 to 2,777,000,000, revenue slumped slightly from 4,780,000,000 to 4,584,000,000. Both Liabilities and Assets decreased by \~3 billion. To me this implies sale of assets, but otherwise no aberrant activity.

Then we look at the 13F short positions. Disclaimer, all these positions are *put and call options*, currently there is no way that I know of to define these firms' short share positions.

https://preview.redd.it/fpj4kjxc8dx61.png?width=3368&format=png&auto=webp&s=34cb9c0e2df805c29c2e12ac949926047062c73e

Some familiar names in this bunch. One thing that should be noted is that share borrowing has been next to nothing. 

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT)

This makes sense because the float is about a tenth of the SO, so firms trying to short this stock need only use dark pool. Based on the 13F positions alone, it's easy to anticipate a drop. How far it'll go? Well supply is clearly massive while demand is low, daily volume reaching only 10-20% of the float. The P/B value is \~92, so the drop could continue for quite some time without intervention. The Friday DTCC rule implementation won't effect this stock because it's very likely that the shorts can be covered in any case.

As we all know both AMD and XLNX have had record earnings and guidance this rate of growth in my opinion is pointing towards a chip shortage not really being as bad as we had assumed or else they would not have said that. AMD historically has been quite conservative with its guidance and we could see as high as 18B in revenue 2021.

The XLNX merger poses risk and has in my opinion been the major cause of this side ways movement as all analysts have upgraded it to 100+. After the last 5 red days it has had it is sitting at 77 dollars underperforming all semis and having a relatively low PE for a company with so much future potential.

&#x200B;

TLDR: BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY OCT 85 CALLS"
2021-05-05 22:32:52,wallstreetbets,"I've been bullish on AMD since I heard Jim Keller was helping design the Zen architecture.

Am still bullish but:

Intel CEO swapped and competition will be back in a few years. Intel is entering GPU market. As of right now, TSMC is having trouble keeping up with production due to drought + high demand without enough capacity to meet demands since TSMC is the most ahead semiconductor fab.

AMD products are flying off the shelves right now like other tech products but if competitors have competitive products at similar price levels andare in stock then people will flock to them.

In the enterprise space AMD is starting to take up market share and that will be amazing long-term. Their CPU architecture is solid and, being the first to use chiplet designs (which imo is the future) they will have a leg up against Nvidia and Intel who haven't really touched chiplets yet. Intel is currently brewing plans that will pay off in a couple years (heard they're hiring back some retired, genius designers for a 'fun project'). Nvidia is ahead of AMD in terms of GPU in terms of ray tracing and gaming performance but imo not by a insurmountable gap.

Mid and short-term, tech stocks are receding and (imo) markets looks like they about to crash or something.

I'm fairly new to actually investing but I've lurked around the investing scene for a while. You should double check my claims - I'm just a computer engineering undergrad who really likes games so naturally am a fan of hardware.

The company also smiles outwardly to the communities, often highlighting their philanthropies on their feeds, rather than their growth. I'm sure there are several reasons for this, but, I eat rainbows for breakfast, so, I'll park it here.

    If you are a stockholder whose shares are held in “street name” (i.e., in the name of a broker or other custodian) you may vote the shares at the annual meeting only if you obtain a legal proxy from the broker or other custodian giving you the right to vote the shares.
    ...you will be entitled to attend the annual meeting only if you were a stockholder of record as of the close of business on April 15, 2021 or if you hold a valid proxy for the annual meeting.
    

This is financial advice.  Alexander stated the meeting would be a day later than scheduled.  Send this to a broker.

Dear Sir:

I have been with Ameritrade for years.  I have appealed this matter six times.  I am sorry to bother you but, I was told that there is no broker for me.

I do not want to vote, but that right is reserved.  Please send my GME proxy to me.

Sincerely,

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BNGO to the MOON‼️ 🚀🚀 + Revenge on Shitadel. Over the last few months, $BNGO has been manipulated by the shorts. It was once almost $16 a share, but now it is under $6 a share. The companies technicals are amazing (check out auspicious_dissenT’s DD), but the suits are fucking ruthless. Last I checked, 14% of shares were currently being shorted ([BNGO Short Interest](https://fintel.io/ss/us/bngo)), but that number seems to be rising. 

The company is taking steps to cure cancer and other genetic diseases, but the hedge funds don’t care. As long as retail traders lose money and they make money they don’t give a shit about what these companies are doing for the world. SHITADEL is responsible for a number of these shorts (couldn’t find the link, but plenty of reputable Youtubers have confirmed this). It seems as if Shitadel is attempting to make back some of their $GME losses. 

This subreddit has the power to squeeze $BNGO to all time highs! We need to rise up once again and show the suits that they can’t bully retail traders/investors. We have the power to screw them over in $GME fashion, so let’s fucking do it!!!

TLDR; Shitadel hates cancer patients and are shorting $BNGO. Let’s squeeze this to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-05-05 20:34:19,wallstreetbets,"Be careful. You’re using logic, reason, and facts on this sub. 

I almost hate the phrase “short squeeze”. What happened with GME was a once in a generation event. That’s it. 

Now every bag holder in every stock is yelling “Short Squeeze!!!!!!” at every stock that’s has even one percent of shares shorted."

2021-05-05 20:16:46,wallstreetbets,If you don't like their outlook to actually finish ITM despite a trend selling to take profits. Or if you don't have the funds whether straight up or on margin to cover so you sell in hopes it dips below. I've gotten assigned on naked calls before and it's not a great feeling for more than just having to watch your sales profits go up in smoke.

2021-05-05 21:00:10,wallstreetbets,"I'm relatively new, but I've seen the argument made both ways.  Vol low and price drop = HFs shorting and now vol high and price drop = HFs shorting.  How can we know it's not just the market selling?"
2021-05-06 10:42:00,wallstreetbets,That does make sense. I like the idea of Rocket Auto too though and they still seem like a strong company with a lot of potential growth in the future for dumbing down the mortgage market and make it easier for people like me with social anxiety to just get a mortgage through them. I’m gonna treat this as a discount and buy some more shares for the long haul
2021-05-05 21:11:12,wallstreetbets,It's too much volume too fast after the earnings report release to be the market selling. A person waiting to make a decision on the report has to at least read it and process it to make the decision. Algorithms and people who aren't counting on the information in the report and already know they are shorting it let fly as soon as it becomes public because the first one to short gets the best entry.
2021-05-05 21:38:50,wallstreetbets,Bought 500 AH. What makes you so sure they haven't bought back?
2021-05-06 01:40:32,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think you can tell the difference. Shorting is just selling borrowed stock, so how would the fact that the share was borrowed make a difference in the price movement? At the end of the day the only thing that matters is number of bids, offers and market buyers and sellers. Steep drop means all the offers were taken all the way down to the price where it plateaued. Right? If you have some other theory, I’m all ears.

Regarding quick selling after earnings, that doesn’t mean much. The time it takes to scrape a PDF and parse a number out is in the order of milliseconds."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why is NNDM 40% short? Serious question. This is a cheap stock thats a top Cathie holding. I think their product is completely unique and probably the only of its kind right now. I think the product they sell will be integral to the space, aviation, and micro chips industries. This is a company that completely cleaned up their balance sheet during the last bull run. Yet, they are 40% shorted by instiutions??? I saw three institutional share offerings performed over the last 6 months. One for 6 dollars, one for 8 dollars, and one for 11 dollars. What changed that made these institutions that wanted to buy this stock into heavily shorting it? This post is not meant to sway any reader towards one direction or another. Its a sincere question, why is this thing so shorted now??"
2021-05-06 10:18:25,wallstreetbets,"They have earnings next to nothing compared to their valuation. Their overall valuation is based heavily off their cash on hand from those offerings you mention.

Hedge funds are trying to drive the price down and make money doing so. Growth stocks are getting beat down and let go by people who were trying to make a quick buck without playing quick tactics. Hedge funds will then scoop up those shares by bottom feeding and then convince everybody to make a run on it again."

2021-05-06 00:59:10,wallstreetbets,I don't think so but don't know enough about it to say specifically. All I know is the NFT dividend would 100% guarantee to force them to cover and seems more likely.

You throw your phone, and you pin her to the sofa, then the ground. You both roll about, wrestling, like lion cubs. Kissing, lightly biting. Sometime later, you both stop, breathing hard. She grabs an open bottle of red wine, and you pass it back and forth. Eventually she says, “I want to do that more.”

But you’ve already found your phone again to check Futures. Still red. “Uh huh,” you say, distracted. She stares at you for a long moment, but you don’t realize it. Silently, she gets up and goes to bed, and you don’t say a word because you don’t notice.

BioLineRx  Ltd. (NASDAQ: BLRX) (TASE: BLRX), a late clinical-stage  biopharmaceutical company focused on oncology, today announced positive  top-line results from the Company's GENESIS Phase 3 trial evaluating its  lead clinical candidate, Motixafortide, in combination with granulocyte  colony stimulating factor (G-CSF, the standard of care in this  indication), for hematopoietic stem-cell mobilization for autologous  bone marrow transplantation in multiple myeloma patients.

This immenses effort accomplished by the company made possible to win an important battle against cancer!

Despite  the great results, MMs and shorts once again have played this stock and  punished the ones believing and investing in science to help people  suffering from cancer.

At some  point we should all raise against this behavior and make them pay!!  Time for short squeeze!! I will personally try to invest along the way  holding everything single share until a Partner takes over!!

2) the ceo said this yesterday during the call

On our second question on providing more cash deposit guidance, going forward, I think we're always struggling with the balance of disclosing as much as possible to enable the shareholders to understand the business, but also protecting the business and trying to really balance those two things.


Uhh what? Enron said the same shit lmao

Real Rates are going up nothing we can do about it not even JPow. 

Higher Rates = poison for growth companies w a stupid valuation.  2020 was different the market didn’t care but now it grew a conscience and it does.  

What to short;  like Simba would say “Everything the Market Touches with a Price to Sale Ratio of 20X or more.  Pick your victim plot it on ychart.com and see what the PS is.   

PayPal: 15X a bit expensive but not horrible and they killed it. They go up. (SQ; is only 12X if they have good numbers they should pump). 

FASTLY; before today 24X expensive and missed their numbers you are fucked. 

NIKOLA: 9,400X (it’s not a typo over 9K) if they don’t cure cancer on Friday with their earnings report they are gonna crash.  

OCGN: 70X. They is fucked as well. And not only for their high PS.

If you wanna moonshot BTC miners (or lose money anyways 🤡) go for RIOT or MARA

RIOT and MARA mine around 150+ bitcoin per month, SOS just announced they mined 42 BTC for the whole quarter. 

Per their April update SOS is looking towards: 177 Peta-Hashes per second (PH/s), whereas MARA and RIOT are in the Exa-hashes (1000x greater) using top of the line bitmain miners vs crappy SOS miners. 

Q4 2022, Riot expects a total hash rate capacity of 7.7 EH/s with a fleet of approximately 81,146 Antminers, 95% of which will be the latest generation S19 series model. This level of growth represents a 93% increase over the Company’s previously estimated committed hash rate capacity of 4.0 EH/s by October 2021. \[MARA growth is similar but too lazy to post\]

Even getting back to pre-covid stock price would be a big gain at this point, and we're coming into a summer where those vaccinated are ready to get out and travel after being pent up.

passed the military testing lab application, proving their product is fire proof to a certain extent and provides insulation. They are now working on thinning out the paint for US distribution in Q2. 

HRSVF: 3.14 a share 

I’m buying more because their a top 10 us marijuana company. They have more than 30 stores in operation. They tried to pull a CURLF but failed miserably. They tried expanding by cannibalizing other companies but didn’t have the funds. They are now closing law suits and are following true leafs strategy. They plan to grow organically and hold over 50 more licenses to expand into other markets. They trade at around 3x PE as well and Arizona just opened up shop for marijuana. It doesn’t hurt that HRVSF has a foothold in that market as that’s where it’s based...

Buying more of CURLF and CRLBF:

TCNNF gets a lot of love based on the fact it’s growing organically and not giving up shares for growth sake. It’s been rewarded but I’m a noob and based off sales and store volume. Both companies win out IMO. Both are silver backs and one is expanding into the European market while growing its American market as well. While the other is focused in America, as it’s the biggest marijuana market by far. I urge you to look at revenue, ebita of these 2 and the more expensive marijuana companies in 2020...

APPH: they have a 60 acre building that is/will yield up to 30x more yield per acre! They run their facility on 90% recycled water!

They are a B rated company and plan to have 5-12 structures growing other vegetables and fruits. They strategically picked western Appalachia in Kentucky, so they can reach 70% of groceries stores in 24 hours. They have deals with all major grocery chains and I see them as the beyond meat of greens. They ranked number 11 as a newer company in the top 500 of future green companies, within agriculture..."

2021-05-06 01:28:06,wallstreetbets,"Alright you filthy degenerates, I don’t have much time here but what I’m going to tell you is **very important**.

So I need you to zip up your pants and listen closely—

As you know, I’m Bill. Trading 20 billion on 5x margin losing it all in 2 days and now I’m just a retail trader who’s financially insolvent using Robinhood Gold like you.

*But none of that matters.*

What matters is every day you and your buddies are getting **shafted** by not having access to trade swaps like I did at Archegos with derivative equities.

And what is a trade swap?

Well think of it as you pay the bank interest to hold a stock for you without every having to actually own it. They get the interest, you get the profits. **And if it goes tits up? We’ll you can just default on it.**

That’s right, you PLTR tards could have had someone else carrying those bags for the past 5 months instead of dying yourself.

And thus, I am officially proposing a petition to get Robinhood on board of allowing us retail a level playing field and access to the same swaps firms and institutions can have.

\*Also Robinhood is the last one to give me margin so I *really* need this to work 🙏

Who's in?

Got fucked and sold. It could see a dead cat bounce but reasons it won’t:

1. Too much competitions in mortgage space
2. Even through they’re touted as more than mortgage company, 90% of revenue comes from originations.
3. Originations are a race to the bottom. This is evident in the gains on sales decreasing and they’re guiding lower next quarter. Too much competition, it’s literally a race to the bottom. For mortgages no one care about company/loyalty, they just want the cheapest rate and will work for it. 
4. Rates increasing, houses cost too much and lower rates are not worth paying the premium. 
5. CEO sounds charismatic but also a used cars salesman and snakish, very lousy conference call it being Pre recorded. 
6. It’s public in name only. Only 5% available to public, rest insiders. Think about it, a bank or outside public can never have a voice in the company/control and banks hate that. Like what’s even the point of owning stock? The best stocks have 90%+ float available to the public. This is not really public company. 
7. Good private company not good public

Fuck this stock, this is going down to $15"

2021-05-05 21:50:35,wallstreetbets,"The arguments that I have heard so far are

1. It is not approved. Authorised under emergency use has different meaning to them.
2. Lack of testing, under normal process vaccines go under years of tests before getting approved, so they fear about unknown long term effects of the vaccine.
3. RNA based vaccine, people are afraid it would modify their DNA. Some also claim all participants in previous RNA based vaccine testing died.
4. People refer to how is that we had the record low flu cases this season? However, the covid number are record high. Pointing towards data manipulation at government levels.
5. They also point out high number of side effects being reported as a direct result of these vaccination.
6. Disbelief in covid death numbers, and severity of situation.
7. 5G conspiracy theory."

The moratoriums helped stall a lot of foreclosures, so the market will be hit with higher than normal foreclosures once those are all gone, and then when interest rates go up and people aren’t quickly spending $100k over value, the people who already bought will realize they are fucked the second they need an equity loan or to sell their houses.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I think $SNDL might be skyrocketing soon - too many catalysts waiting to be ignited Hello, my fellow apes -

I think $SNDL is grossly undervalued and they are prepped for the rocket launch to the moon!Recently $SNDL has been performing poorly and my smooth brain was panicking until I did my research. This is my first DD - feel free to give me improvement feedbacks too.

1. The SNDL earning report was supposedly coming out on May 14th but was moved to May 11th. If a company pulls their earning date earlier, it either means they are confident or they are making a better strategic move to gather investors.(A company would delay dates to buy time for damage mitigation)
2. They have been extremely strategic about raising money and allocating resources.Firstly, they have acquired Inner Spirit Holdings and Spiritleaf Retail Cannabis Network.[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sundial-growers-acquire-inner-spirit-110000203.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sundial-growers-acquire-inner-spirit-110000203.html)Secondly, they have reported that they own more than 10% of Valens securities.[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-files-early-warning-report-issued-pursuant-to-national-instrument-62-103-301282849.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-files-early-warning-report-issued-pursuant-to-national-instrument-62-103-301282849.html)
3. They have been managing debt very well. Sundial Growers' total debt last quarter was $1.132 million. Looking back at the last five years, Sundial Growers's total debt peaked in December 2019 at $150.1 million. Sundial Growers's total debt decreased in 2020 (1.132 million, -99.2%) and increased in 2018 (58.828 million, +305,525.1%) and 2019 (150.1 million, +155.1%). And as of this year, they have announced debt-free!Their earnings: [https://fireandflower.com/sundial](https://fireandflower.com/sundial)
4. Cannabis legislation is around the corner - even New York is starting to accept cannabis.[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/04/business/cannabis-real-estate-new-york.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/04/business/cannabis-real-estate-new-york.html)
5. [CFRA Sundial Growers Inc has been recently updated to Hold. The Street has not yet updated their report.](https://i.redd.it/p8eyc3y86er61.png)

Edit 1 - I accidentally pressed post and added other details. My bad - my smooth brain and my certified retardation making it hard.

Edit 2 - [Busy\_Project\_7622](https://www.reddit.com/user/Busy_Project_7622/) posted the link to their earnings for no.3.

Edit 3- Thank you for awards and upvotes!"

People are on edge and paranoid, suspicious of everything and seeing giants in the shadows of hobbits. I don’t think there’s much you guys can do to change that for those people, all of the mods have been handling these “dramas” very well and being direct IMO. 

Hopefully like a bad break-up or losing a loved one it is just a *matter of time*, the steam will slowly release, the tension and paranoia will dissipate and the dramas will peter off.

I can’t imagine how frustrating it must be for you guys to selflessly work so hard for the sub and all of us residents, only to be attacked by the mobs for the very things you fight against, a lot of us see that and know that the mods are **based af**

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMD is primed to go up soon. AMD is nearing its lowest point in the last 6 months, which I believe is mostly due to the very publicly discussed chip shortage.

The chip shortage is drastically affecting sales of the new graphics cards and the new PS5 and Xbox Series X (and S) consoles.  Both Sony and Microsoft have been very public about how their console shortages will be resolved soon.  Once the shortages stop, sales will go up, which means the stock with go up.

I do believe the newer Nvidia graphics cards will have a shortage issue a little longer than the consoles, but that is mostly due to how useful powerful graphics cards are for space heater mining.  AMD has tried to put protections in place to keep the cards from being used as space heaters to prevent the shortage from being as severe, but these protections are easily bypassed, making the newer cards the go to choice as space heaters.

I'm not seeing any signs of short selling on this stock, so this isnt a stick it to the man for a squeeze situation, but I do believe in the next few months the stock will go up from the 77 its at now to roughly the 95 or higher that it was before the shortage became an issue.  The lack of clear sign of short positions is also an indication that the trading groups dont think the stock is likely to go down.  If it doesn't go down that means its going up.

TLDR; AMD is at its lowest point in 6 months and its sales will jump up soon as the virus goes away.  Small bump up in a month or so, huge bump a couple months later.

Disclosure:  I just YOLO'd $2300"

2021-05-05 22:54:37,wallstreetbets,I rather buy amc
2021-05-06 16:38:33,wallstreetbets,"What kind of shit and lazy ""DD"" is this? Not every stock is retail VS the big bad hedges - I would even say not a single stock depends on this scenario not even fucking GME or AMC. You name low short interest as a sign to buy even though AMD had like 15 percent SI, if I read that correctly? And why the hell does this even matter? 


You name ZERO sources, set a price target completely out of thin air. You don't name possible catalysts, not even a bear case. 


You just say ""Guys, look it is at a kinda low point now, lets go, buy this, it has to go up, stonks only go up, trust me I am so clever"". 


I bought a lot of AMD especially in the last days, because I think it is undervalued - at least compared to other overbloated tech stocks. But I am tired of reading this lazy shit DDs all over WSB. Please don't write DDs if you are new to the stock market and don't have any clue wtf you are doing and what matters."
2021-05-05 21:03:46,wallstreetbets,They can turn in their projects late. No due date on the moon
2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Where is the love for $WISH, DD for Context Logic Metrics:

* Pe:  n.a
* Eps: -2.83
* 52 weeks high: 32.85
* Cash: 1.1 B
* Debt:  49 M
* Short Vol is 50%

What are their operations:

ContextLogic Inc. operates as a mobile ecommerce company in Europe, North America, South America, and internationally. It operates Wish, an ecommerce platform that connects merchants and consumers. The company was founded in 2010 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.


What is great about them:

* Wish is a global brand operating in 100 counties and its mission is to bring affordable and entertaining mobile experience to billions of consumers around the world. 

* They work with 500k merchants and has shipped 640 million products main focus is mobile where they are the number 1 most downloaded app in the world.

* So there is strong brand recognition as they spend a lot of money onto advertisement. They have clear mission and focus.

* The potential is huge, Most e-commerence focus on convenience vs price but wish does the opposite they focus on price.

* Over 75% of europe and 44% of us households have an annual income less than 75 k and that exactly what wish targets. People that care about more about saving money 

* They can really grow as more developing countries gain access to the internet like africa middle east and latin america. The average income there is 18k you would think these people will care about time or cost more? 

* They want value oriented costumers.

Technology:

* Most people see wish as a simple buy platform. But its way more they have deep learning meaning the company has software that studies the costumers behavior and proposes to them products. This has lead to 70% of sales not being from searches but from the menu.

* They use a discovery based menu which is very attractive and also focus on personalized browsing just like tik tok does deep learning at its finest.

* They collect data from more than 100 million users every month to personalize the menu even more giving them a very unique advantage. Using data is the key to success here because they use data to get better and more effective ads to maximiaze returns and conversion . 

Growth

* They grew revenue from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $1.9 billion in 2019 at a compound annual growth rate of 31% and from $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 32% revenue is diversified and global. In 2019, 93% of our revenue was from marketplace services, 84% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 16% of which was from our native advertising tool, ProductBoost, and 7% was from logistics services. 

* They refer to marketplace revenue, excluding revenue from ProductBoost, as core marketplace revenue. ProductBoost is an advertising feature by which our merchants can promote their listings within user feeds. 

* For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 82% of revenue was from marketplace services, 90% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 10% of which was from ProductBoost, and 18% was from logistics services.

* In terms of geographic diversification by users, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 43% of core marketplace revenue came from Europe, 42% from North America, 5% from South America, and 10% from the rest of the world growth has been highly capital efficient. 

* They have been able to achieve this massive growth and scale by having net cumulative cash flow from operations of $16 million from January 1, 2017 to September 30, 2020, aided by their positive cash float, where they receive an upfront payment from a user, and remit payment to a merchant a number of weeks later. 

Merchants

* They are basically the middle man that connects millions of costumers with merchants. They also provide them with value data to help them do more sales and expand even more. Analytics and data is a key part of their business and it should not be ignored

What's is not so great about them

* They grew to fast and have some problems with logistics 

* There have been some serious delays and even packages missing. They will need to use money from going public to solve this matter and get better at serving costumers. 

* There business model is to expand advertise and get new costumers. But their problems in logistic could cause them problems with visitor retention and i want to see improvements here.

* Competition is brutal of course and they will need to utilize their competitive edge to outshine the rest. They don't really compete with amazon but more with alibaba and JD and it will be hard to prevail.

Bottom line
* Potential  9/10
* Health  9/10
* fundamentals  7/10
* Competition hardship  11/10

Almost everywhere the price target is in the mid 20 range. Yet there is 50% short volume. ITS A STEAL AT <$15.

Thanks for reading."
2021-05-06 05:59:05,wallstreetbets,"The fundamentals are actually 9/10 too when you notice WISH is the no1 marketplace in 43 second or third world countries. E-commerce is already really big in western countries and china so market growth will mainly happen in the second and third world. Especially as they get better access to internet AND a bigger middle class.

For example in India they grew from 4% market share to 18% in a year. And had [3 million](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0fE2jMXoAgxjLn?format=png) downloads last month. The fundamentals of Wish are overlooked by western investors."

They didn't give a sh\*t about the research roaring kitty did or how he was showing people how to trade. The theme was somebody lost some money so Now Big Daddy Government gets to Step In to protect the people, the dumb ass public!!!! Woot!

This isn't a matter of who is proposing it. It's a matter of who votes for it, and who votes against it. Politicians with a financial interest in the institutions that benefit from PFOF are not going to vote against it, and they come from both political parties."

2021-05-06 10:37:35,wallstreetbets,"With something like payment for order flow it isn't about the individual though. They aren't using your specific individual trade to make their moves and screwing you over individually they are looking at the overall trading activity of tons of people and making their moves based on that. 

If one person chooses to use a broker that charges commissions instead then they are still going to get screwed by PFOF because they will still be trading against institutions who have more information than them. The result of that is that it is in the best interests of the individual to use a commission free broker but it would be better for retail investors overall if no one did. Therefore if we determine that PFOF is bad for retail investors overall then it has to be regulated because the individual investors are just going to do what is best for themselves even if it actually hurts them when everyone else does as well."

2021-05-05 22:45:13,wallstreetbets,I was replying to someones elses comment about liking the no fees for trading. Everyone likes that. I would rather pay $7 for a trade fee if legislation to make it public knowledge who is shorting and manipulating the market. Losses from that are much larger than the $7 fee. That may be the case if the Brokerages profits get squeezed a little because  market manipulation becomes much more scrutinized and looked at as being illegal and people start to get in trouble. IDK Maybe maybe not.

Add that to the amount of cash flowing in the economy and easy access to investing, its a whole different ball game now.

2021-05-06 09:30:11,wallstreetbets,MMs get a rebate if they fill an order.  The order flow gets them the fills and hence the rebate.  The customer is happy because he got a quick and good fill for less commission.  The MM is happy because he got the rebate and the exchange is happy because they get more volume.  Everyone wins.
2021-05-05 23:01:11,wallstreetbets,Regardless of if you are buying or selling options do you think you will get a better deal from the exchanges?  They by definition make their money by servicing your order below market price.  Orders filled from NYSE are notoriously shit and I would much rather have several robots compete for my order rather than 3 exchanges.  Payment for order flow has done nothing but help the consumer.  Also if you trade on liquid underlyings like SPY QQQ etc then you can get nothing other than the perfect fill since the spreads on options are only a penny wide.  Hence you get reduced commissions from pfof and a great fill.
2021-05-06 12:24:11,wallstreetbets,You’re retarded if you think I personally am giving them 1/3 billion per month. Also that’s not even how much Robinhood makes a month dumbass

2021-05-05 20:04:11,wallstreetbets,"You seem about 13 and probably are using your moms SSN to open a brokerage account but I’ll explain to you how your trade gets filled. 

You place trade for $15, broker routes order to citadel who finds a seller. Seller is selling for $15. Great. Citadel skims .0001 off the trade per share and maybe your net execution is $15.0001.  So you paid a fraction of a cent for a trade in worse execution. The way citadel makes money is they do millions of these transactions with leverage.

2021-05-06 04:02:04,wallstreetbets,"Well, good thing libertarianism does not want to abolish government. You are confusing libertarianism with anarchist libertarianism.

The constitution, you know, the thing that founded our government and currently acts as the supreme law of our land, is grounded in libertarian principles on an originalist and textualist perspective. But, our constitution is not followed in that manner anymore and has been time and time again interpreted in a way that promotes the interests of each party, and altogether increases the size and power of government drastically. Why do you think gaining control of the SCOTUS is such a big deal. Judges technically can't apply constitutional law according to their political beliefs or personal opinions. It all comes down to constitutional interpretation methodology. 

Interpret the constitution as a libertarian would and you end up with an entity that would not have a baseball bat in the first place. Instead, we the people own the bat."
2021-05-06 03:38:22,wallstreetbets,"Well you designated the real enemy as rich fucks. Crony capitalism exists in virtue of an authoritarian government. This is by no means excusing rich people. Of course rich people are to blame as well. So what can we do against this? Surely, everyone (we the people) is against this whether democrat, republican, or libertarian.

First off, can we pass a law against lobbying? Main reason this probably will never happen is because lobbyists can lobby against anti-lobby laws/politicians. Logically, by the time we pass a law against lobbying, it would have already been gone! (moral politicians were somehow elected with no greedy rich people support?). But wait, hypothetically speaking this is the exact point we want to get to, so how do we get there? 

We sorta have two ways to approach this, if we want is solved. Do you see the issue of too much government or too little government. Aka libertarianism vs socialism. Do we want to take economic responsibility and place it in the hands of the people? Or in the hands of the government?

Libertarians argue for free markets. And the most important thing we have to understand is that America is NOT a free market by any means. Check out Mises.org to get an in depth grasp on the free market's solutions. 

Now, I personally am for libertarianism. I love liberty and not feeling like the government has to babysit me and has the right to such an absurd amount of my own labor and property. The constitution lays out taxing restraints in the general welfare clause pretty straightforwardly. The first effort against the meaning and intent of the clause came from Alexander Hamilton.

""This debate surfaced in Congress in 1790, when Madison strongly criticized Hamilton's Report on Manufacturing and industry on the grounds that Hamilton was construing his broad interpretation of the clause as a legal basis for his extensive economic programs.""

Sounds like the beginning of what we know today. I am libertarian because I value the constitution and the liberty/lack of government power it was supposed to provide. The general welfare clause changed after FDR and granted the federal government an unlimited access to OUR funds. 

But, I must admit that libertarianism does not have much of a pragmatic appeal considering how out of proportionally large the government already is. I admit that reversing this route feels... impossible (sorry founding fathers). I love the theory of libertarianism, but unfortunately it gets a bad rep a lot of the time because of grossly over simplistic and practically meaningless quotes from people like u/daedricworldeater - ""yeah except libertarians dont do anything for the public good. They just prop up their masters and call it freedom."" 

The irony in this statement makes me laugh. The republican and democrat led government is more powerful and larger than ever before and guess what, they have not done anything for the public good either. If they did then we would not be here talking about it. And masters? What masters? Libertarians value the consumer, not greedy rich people, if that is what you are referring to? Realistically, (getting super libertarian now) who is my master right now, who is your master right now? Answer: government. We are so worried about these laws that will affect our investments in the market. Once I or YOU make those gains, we have to let go of over 20% of it? WSB is more deserving of getting 20% of my profits than the govt is. Who would be the one political party who lobbyists are afraid of? If the free market is implemented, probably libertarians. Go take a look at the rich and how well they have done under any government controlled society ever. Sure, call it crony socialism but at the end of the day how different is that from actual socialism? And yes, people make this same argument against a free market and capitalist society but we really have not seen that yet. Big govt/socialism has been seen throughout history and... yeah. Mises provides convincing work that this type of system will work, especially with the emphasis Americans tend to place on hard work. I apologize for the ranting and rambling, I just like to get my thoughts out. Ultimately, yes I agree with your above statement entirely, but my agreement is grounded in a different philosophy.

At the end of the day most people can tell, and data shows this, that we are heading towards bigger government as a solution. So, we will see how it works out. In the mean time, give libertarianism a chance!

But many libertarians do not believe that the view is an ideology at all. At its very core it is based on natural laws and natural rights. The free market creates equal opportunity and does not discriminate. Head over to Mises.org to learn about the benefits for society as a whole in a free market. They explain all of this very well. 

I think you are making assumptions that it does not work for minorities, or is against the poor, on the basis that America has a free market and has led us to our current state. But we do not."

2021-05-06 00:18:17,wallstreetbets,"I'll help you out because I can tell you are new and I'm not petty.  You can thank me later.

1.  Look for stocks with high ivr.  IVR is a measure of the implied volatility of the underlying.  High implied volatility means that options are trading rich and you can sell the high premium.  The central thesis is that implied volatility is mean reverting and will eventually drop.  When iv drops options lose value.  This is what we are looking to profit from.
2. If you are wrong then you can roll out your position for  credit and wait it out.  Always trade small so you don't get knocked out of the game.  This strategy works more often than not and has positive expected value so as long as you don't risk everything in one trade you can keep playing the game and profit long run.
3. The setup:  If you want to sell naked then sell a call and a put both with 5 deltas.  If you want to sell defined risk with things like condors and spreads then try to collect 1/3 the width of the strike in premium.  If the market hits your short strike on the defined risk spread then roll it out a month when the market is near the same price as your short strike.  If you are selling strangles then roll up and out when your delta gets to around 25.  All positions should have 45 days to expiration.  Collect profits at 50% max profit or 21 dte.   Wait out the losers.
4. This isn't a ""retail"" tip.  It's what the options market makers do.  You can find more info here.

Sherman staved off impending doom and the Jim Bellpocalypse long enough for Cohen and friends to arrive.  Some decisions were good (questioning Circle of Life, the very hated Game Advisor management program), others not so much (GaMeStOp Is EsSeNtIaL bIzNeSs.... did not work out so well).

But in general the one thing that is clear is that he was not a snek.  Maybe the hedgies put him in to cover up Jim Bell's real destruction tactics, or maybe he truly saw the light of Papa Cohen and rebelled.  Doesn't matter to me.  RC says 'FOR' for Sherman, so I do too."

2021-05-05 21:39:39,wallstreetbets,How is that an insane conspiracy theory that there are more shares owned than should be? 26 million is an insanely low amount of shares for a stock that was trading with a volume of over 100-200 million a day at its peak in January.   Fidelity is claiming they had over ten million people transfer from robinhood since january.  If each person transferring had 3 shares of GME (likely much higher) that's more than the float right there...not including any other brokerage or the users fidelity already had.  I'm not saying it's guaranteed thing and they will absolutely get more votes than the float but at this point I do t see how anyone could think that there aren't way more shares owned than 26 million by retail.

For example, 1 $1000 (exp. 10/15) call option is going for about $5,000 at the moment. If Microstrategy's treasury appreciates another 100% (conservatively) at expiry, their stock price would likely double to around $1260, making the call option worth $26,000. Pretty good profit. That's a big IF, which is probably why not many people are taking this position, right?"

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CRSR is pumping today because yesterday's earnings beat was not priced in at all. Volume broke the sideways cycle today. By every metric, the stock is WAY undervalued...the ship is just taking off. Little ape-friendly DD on CRSR if you haven't been paying attention.  The stock is surging today...finally.... after an unexpectedly awesome earnings call yesterday. I've held a position since October (got in at one of the $40+ peaks), and have been bleeding ever since. The time has finally come for liftoff.

The stock is probably one of the safest undervalue plays on the market right now, and the ship is just setting sale. Here's what you need to know.

* Well-established company within one of the hottest retail industries in the world.  

* The stock IPO'd last September, and immediately surged from $17 to $50+ on great Q3 2020 earnings (fueled by the pandemic gaming surge)

* CRSR has been making some excellent acquisitions, most notably Elgato, establishing market dominance in the streaming space.

* After falling from peak, the price bounced up and down between $35-$45ish leading up to the Q4 earnings release.  

*Despite good Q4 numbers, the short interest surged, and the price tanked post-earnings in February.  

* Even with excellent fundamentals, the stock became a prime target for swing/day traders. Short interest stayed high.  It was viciously attacked by bears spreading all kinds of bs FUD.   

* Many were trying to spread rumors that video games were a fad that only took off due to the pandemic, so the company's performance was a fluke.  Others were spreading fear about the share lockup period expiration, which had the potential to release a few million more shares onto the market. Others were spreading concerns about CRSR not being able to fulfill inventory due to the semiconductor shortage. None of that FUD has come to fruition.

* The stock continued to trade sideways, often swinging +/- 3% every day. Swing traders & shorts took advantage of the low volume and relatively low float. 

* Q1 2021 earnings showed sales figures that nearly matched holiday season 2020, and record net income. Proving that sales have not been hindered by the pandemic waning in the US or the semiconductor shortage. 

* Just about every fundamental has been improving every quarter. Sales are up, income margin is way up, Cash is up, Debt is down, 

* LOGI's market cap is currently trading at more than 6X CRSR. But this quarter, LOGI's Net Sales were less than 3X higher. Both are trading below industry avg P/E Ratio

Most importantly, unlike other bubble-fied tech stocks, there was NO price runup to yesterday's earnings release. The beat was not priced in at all.  The stock is currently completely undervalued by just about every metric.

Today, volume has been higher than it's been in months managing to break out of the sideways cycle....there is  A LOT of room to run. 

This stock is easily undervalued by 45% or more right now. STRAP UP!

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CRSR short squeeze is starting right now 🚀🚀🚀 What's up retards? I'm going to try to make this brief, but concise because why use many word when few word good enough. I might be retarded, but I'm pretty sure today is going to mark the first day of a short squeeze with Corsair and unlike a lot of the other shitty ""short squeeze incoming... hopefully"" (looking at you CLOV) posts on WSB this one is going to happen (is happening) whether you Apes are in or not. I'm only here because I made a fuckton of money on GME earlier this year and I want to give something back to the community.

Here's the rub:

Corsair is a premier PC accessories company that's been around for a couple decades, but just went public towards the end of last year. Since then they have [KILLED their earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/analysis?p=CRSR) EVERY. SINGLE. QUARTER. coming in an average of 60% above the analyst expectations and yet somehow there's 20% short interest on the stock. At first they weren't issuing guidance because pandemic, but yesterday before the bell they reported earnings that were 75.80% above expectations AND RAISED GUIDANCE for 2021 from \~$1.875bil to \~$2bil and yet somehow the stock dropped from $35 premarket to $31.50 at the low of the day because the market is too busy trying to squeeze imaginary currencies recommended by the meme's of eccentric billionaires right now I guess. This is especially moronic because the fundamentals are so incredibly good for this company. As it currently stands market cap is roughly $3 billion, with expected revenue of $2 billion for the year and EBITDA earnings estimated for 2021 at around $250 million. In other words, CRSR has a forward P/E of about 12 right now and Price to Sales of 1.5x, low enough to make a value company blush, and yet this is a rocket fueled growth company in a rapidly expanding growth sector with 20% short interest.

Digging a little deeper:

Not only did the price swing 10% from high to low yesterday, but it was a high volume day for CRSR in general and for some reason the shares short made up [73% of the volume for the day](https://shortvolume.com/?t=crsr). That's right, the shorts really thought shorting another 1 million shares was the right thing to do after that rock star earnings report. This is truly, catastrophically retarded. Today the stock has been up as high as $36.11 and has been holding steady above $35. If we check how many short shares are available on iborrowdesk it looks like the shorts [haven't even started covering today](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/CRSR) from their short positions that were created yesterday AND there are only about 350k short shares available to borrow right now meaning the shorts have very little ammo to try to push the stock down or hunt for stop losses. Those million short shares from yesterday are all currently under water and when they start to cover this is going to push up even higher which will trigger the rest of the 20% of the short interest to consider covering their positions and get out now. There's a word for this kind of chain reaction, what is it..? Oh yeah, SHORT. SQUEEZE.

When do we get to Mars?

Like I said, I'm not here to bullshit you, I truly want to see my fellow apes get some tendies. That said, we're probably not going all the way to Mars. This isn't another GME. But, the moon is within our ape-like grasp. This could easily touch $50 by the end of this year and hit $70+ next year. This isn't just a short squeeze play, this is a long term value play (Logitech, Corsairs major competitor, trades at a 20.5 P/E, so if all we did was reach their P/E with no more earnings growth (ha) we would be at about $55 per share). If you buy now YOU WILL MAKE MONEY. Buy and hold or get some options that will expire in a couple months (squeezes can take a while to play out) and wait, then dump them when you get a 100%+ bagger and post your gain porn. LET'S FUCKING GO!!!

TL;DR: Buy Corsair, get tendies

Positions: 23,000 shares, 250 June $35 calls

Obligatory rockets 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

If you think I'm a financial advisor then you're really fucking retarded.

Edit 5/6/2021: Right at the bell [270k shares were shorted](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/CRSR) driving the stock down. That means of the 350k shares that were available to short there were only 80k left. By the end of the day it had fallen even further to only 70k short shares left to borrow. The shorts have almost completely run out of line. Looking for tomorrow to be an up day. If the whole stock market is a blood bath and paper hands get week then the shorts might be given a get out of jail free card, but if there's any positive momentum at all the covering will begin. Where it stops is anyone's guess."
2021-05-06 09:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Lol short squeeze? Ummm, no, Eagle Tree holds 65% of the shares. They sold less than 10% of their holdings for $35/share. What makes you think they won't sell more at $45/share?

This is a long term play. Eagle Tree is looking to sell Corsair (which is great for holders) so expect this to be a long term hold. Buy shares, because you don't know when this could runup or dip due to the float - calls are risky as it's impossible to time correctly or determine if another company wants to short another 1 million shares."
2021-05-06 17:10:21,wallstreetbets,Just by saying short squeeze you lost all credibility
2021-05-06 15:39:21,wallstreetbets,Well written and true!

2021-05-06 16:12:19,wallstreetbets,"There are currently only 70k shares available to short, so there won't be another 1 million shares getting shorted unless 930k shares are first covered.

If the stock runs from $31.50 to $45 within a month in large part because shorts start covering that is a short squeeze. Not everything has to be compared to GME."
2021-05-06 02:52:21,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, but your numbers are way off and all you have is the intuition that ""everyone has bought their stuff already"". They reflect that in the guidance for 2021 and expect another blow-out quarter in Q2 and then they expect a more reasonable growth for the rest of 2021. Given that guidance, the forward PE 18, and with a growth in the 20% range, this is a cheap buy.

To counterposition your ""everyone is decked out"" comment, gaming had a major boost in popularity in 2020. Yes, people will go out more in the summer and when covid is done. But gaming will not stop. Gaming has been growing for a long time and covid was a catalyst that shaved of a year or two on the growth time table. Corsair gear is high quality and I expect a lot of the new gamers from 2020 will move into high-quality gear in the years to come. Finally, they have boosted their numbers not only through covid, but also through acquisitions, and they are on track to branch out into more gameing related sectors (like software and coaching). Depending on the capex requirements to enter these new growth segments, they might suffer in the short term, but I doubt that."

2021-05-06 09:48:01,wallstreetbets,Good comments Ya P/E being the biggest fudged number i agree... I still recommend all CRSR read my bear thesis its solid and worth a read. I do see your side too all your points time will tell.

2021-05-05 21:48:58,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, who knows. I'm not in CRSR for a short squeeze, I've been holding and averaging down for a few months, but I think at least a nice run with shorts covering is very possible after that last earnings report. I'd like this to eventually be a long term capital gains holding for me, not another short term one."

Expenses since you suddenly lose 10% if equivalent in that scenario. Compounding interest isn’t very tangible during a crash and you’re reduced quality of life could be serious homie"

I expect this very song was made because he and several other backers of the Brexit campaign made bank when the pound crashed as a result of Brexit.

Also just larping a condescending Victorian headmaster all of the time on top of being genuinely out of touch is very off-putting.

>  *""one of the biggest Brexit supporters owns a bunch of pubs""*

 Timothy Martin is almost definitely not part of the profiteering in-group. He is/was just a useful tool for Rees-Mogg and his fellow disaster capitalists. Besides that, beer always sells, looking at the 1920's it even sells more in a good crisis.

> what EVERY International BANK wanted 

1. Every is a very strong word. Using it weakens your argument almost every time you use it.
2. The banks themselves are also not the in-group themselves. They complained because of business interruption and some marginal cost increases due to Brexit. Some of their investors almost certainly are part of the group, but as long as it doesn't interfere with their private profiteering plan it is a non-issue for them.

>Please never try and explain anything to someone who is not British because you are literally a moron.

This will take time. Potentially a long time. So the question is whether people will be willing to wait that long on a stagnant stock or if enough people will leave seeking other market opportunities to trigger a downturn. I do admit that there is hope. Legitimate hope. If gamestop continues to do these monthly $40+ predictable price swings, that will be enough to maintain interest long enough for gamestop to actually accomplish something.

Then there is the other thing that (as Mentioned I think) capital can't really be destroyed, it just gets transformed and transferred. In order to eat next month I need somebody to lose capital, so I can use that capital to buy bread and loose that same capital myself. And so do you.

*Fuck off man, you shouldn't want people to lose money because they were sold something they didn't understand.*

That is one of the most important lessons. Don't buy something you don't understand. I still have troubles preaching that to my mother after she lost 10k+ on a bet she was sold and didn't understand. And yet she refuses to learn and deal with the same guy again with something she doesn't understand just as much. And boy did I try to explain it to her. And yet she trusts that fishy dude more than me. After years of preaching I am not sure if I will be able to feel sympathy for her when it will be gone or way less than she expected. I hope I will be able to not say ""I told you so"" and do a little ""I told you so dance"", but I can't guarantee that.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Better Markets recommendations to SEC for constructive short selling : Recommendations to protect retail and market from destructive short selling in preparation for Thursday's House Financial Services Committee hearing. Heya WSB, some info came out of Better Markets that's worth sharing in light of the upcoming House Financial Services Committee hearing this Thursday. It's a good opportunity for retail investors to get better informed and get empowered.

Better Markets is an independent non-profit whose focus is the promotion of public interest in the financial markets. They're like the watchdogs of Wall Street post-2008. They're proposing the following recommendations to the SEC:  (I'm merely copy-pasting the meat of their most recent report)

&#x200B;

# Public Transparency

>The SEC must dramatically improve short-interest reporting.  All short interests must be publicly reported in a (1) timely, (2) comprehensive, and (3) standalone manner designed to maximize the informational value that rationalizes short selling (and other short interests) in the securities markets.  
>  
>**Recommendations:**  
>  
>***1) Form  13F:***   The  SEC  must  implement  a  long  overdue Form  13F filing  requirement  for institutional investment managers that (1) includes a standalone short-interest schedule as a supplement to existing long-position reporting, (2) contemplates public reporting of all threshold short interests, including those involving securities lending/borrowing, options, and equity derivatives positions, and (3) is published on at least a monthly (as opposed to quarterly) basis, with an appropriately minimal delay calibrated solely to protect trading strategies.  
>  
>***2) Securities  Lending  Reporting:***   The  SEC must implement  section  984(b)  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which instructed the commission to “increase the transparency  of  information  available  to  brokers,  dealers, and  investors,  with  respect  to  the  loan  or borrowing of securities” and which was supposed to be completed “\[n\]ot later than 2 years after the date of \[the Dodd-Frank Act’s\] enactment” in July 2010.1This flagrant disregard of a Congressional directive must  be  remedied  with a securities-lending regulatory  and  public reporting framework (see also comments relating to the consolidated audit trail below).  
>  
>***3) FINRA  Broker-Dealer  Reporting:***   The  SEC  must  require the Financial  Industry  Regulatory  Authority (“FINRA”) to implement daily aggregate short interest reporting for broker-dealers, as it has implemented for the equity  trade  reporting  facilities (see footnote  2 below).    Presently, FINRA Rule  4560 requires broker-dealers  to  report  total  short  positions  in  all  customer  and  proprietary  accounts in  all  equity securities  only twice  per  month. As above,  we  encourage  the  SEC  and  FINRA  to  require  broker-dealer short interest reporting with an appropriately minimal delay.  
>  
>***4) FINRA  Equity  Trade  Reporting  Facilities  &  Exchange  Reporting:***  The  SEC must  implement  regulations requiring FINRA to continue to publish daily short-interest volume and monthly short-interest transaction files, in a format and with content acceptable to the SEC.  The SEC must similarly implement regulations requiring the securities exchanges to continue to publish daily short-interest volume and monthly short-interest transaction files, in a format and with content acceptable to the SEC. The SEC must also consider consolidating information in a descriptive monthly short-sale report and making some portion of the data available through its data visualization tools.

# Regulatory Safeguards:

>The  SEC  must  ensure that short  selling  is  subject  to a reasonable,  unambiguous regulatory  framework that restricts  and  deters short-selling  practices that interfere  with  fair,  orderly,  and efficient markets.  
>  
>**Recommendations:**  
>  
>***5) Eliminate Market-Maker Exception to the Locate Requirement:***  The SEC must institute a broad prohibition on naked short selling (see Appendix A below) and abandon the market-making exception to the Locate Requirement in Regulation SHO.3 That loophole permits the largest proprietary trading firms to engage in naked short selling on the theory that it facilitates trading in hard-to-borrow securities. However, the SEC’s settlement regulations with respect to mandatory buy-ins already provide special accommodations to market-makers that cannot close out their short positions within the failure-to-delivery (“FTD”) close-out timeframe.  
>  
>***6) Short Position Accountability and Limits:***  The SEC must implement a net short position accountability and position limits framework, along with a special filing requirement for market participants that have net short positions at least in hard-to-borrow equities deemed excessive (i.e., exceeding an SEC-determined threshold) relative to the total tradeable float in a security.  Stocks experiencing aggregate short interest in excess of 90 percent of the tradeable float in the security, for example, should trigger imposition of this position limits framework.  
>  
>***7) Uptick Rule:***  The SEC should reinstitute the Uptick Rule, which ameliorated price declines associated with short-selling  for  almost  70  years  without  significant  effects  on  the  development  of  the  U.S.  capital markets.  The SEC’s elimination of that rule prior to the 2008 financial crisis was unnecessary and poorly conceived.  Although there is merit to the Alternative Uptick Rule, we are not persuaded that a single-day 10 percent downturn in a company’s share  price  should  be required  to  reinstate uptick restrictions on short selling.

# Operational Integrity:

>The SEC must ensure that operational integrity is maintained throughout the clearing and settlement system.  
>  
>**Recommendations**:  
>  
>***8) Mandatory  Buy-Ins  and Punitive  Fee  Assessments:***   The  SEC  must continue  to require  clearing broker-dealers to immediately close out failures-to-deliver (“FTDs”) during the settlement process,4which should include mandatory (1) buy-in processes on T+2 for short sales (in a T+1 settlement framework); and(2) fee  assessments designed  to  punish  and  deter firms  with  FTDs that are  not  closed  out  timely under Regulation SHO. Fee assessments should climb as the outstanding period for a short-selling-related FTD lengthens.  
>  
>***9) T+1 Settlement:***  The SEC must shorten the settlement cycle to T+1 (i.e., trade-date-plus-one-trading-day), which would reduce operational and other risks in our settlement system, including risks associated with FTDs and naked short selling.The securities markets currently operate on a T+2 time horizon.  Because margin models at the National Securities Clearing Corporation account for risks during the period of time that elapses between the trading and settlement of transactions, a shorter time horizon for settlement—like  T+1—would  not  only  reduce  risks to  the  clearing and  settlement system  but  also  generally  reduce liquidity  demands  and  risks  to  clearing  firms  that  must  meet  margin  calls  calibrated  to  the  risks  and volatilities expected for the firm’s overall portfolio during the unsettled risk period.In addition to these benefits, the shortened T+1 settlement period may diminish the number of unsettled transactions arising from  the  re-lending  process,  which  has  been  characterized  as  creating  temporary  “phantom”  or “duplicate” shares.

# Monitoring  and Enforcement:

>The  SEC  must  ensure that  the Division  of  Enforcement (‘DOE”) has  the information to protect investors and markets and punish and deter unlawful short selling practices, including manipulation and fraud  
>  
>**Recommendation:**  
>  
>***10) Consolidated Audit Trail:***  Short selling information will be part of the CAT, once operationalized.  The SEC therefore must promptly implement the long-overdue and industry-delayed CAT,so that its divisions can analyze timely  and  comprehensive  information  on  short-selling  for  oversight,  enforcement,  and  policy purposes.See our CAT fact sheet.The SEC also must require regulatory and public reporting of certain information  relating  to securities-lending  activities.    Thus,  it  must  explore  requiring  securities-lending reporting as part of the CAT .

# Conclusion

>Recent data analyzed by the SEC suggests that short selling may comprise as much as half of all listed equity share volume.5Despite  this  fact,  the  practice  is  subject  to  a  rudimentary  regulatory  framework.    Our  recommendations  for reasonable  short-selling  transparency requirements,  regulatory  safeguards,  operational  improvements,  and  monitoring and enforcement measures would enhance the current SEC framework, protect fair, orderly, and efficient trading, level the informational and trading playing field for investors, and better serve issuers (companies), investors, and the purposes of the securities markets—i.e., to support capital formation and the integrity of the price discovery process that informs capital allocation.  
>  
>Unless the SEC makes significant progress in each of the four identified areas, certain short selling practices in the U.S. securities markets will continue to undermine investor and issuer confidence, as well as the fundamental purposes of our markets.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"10 recommendations for improving SEC's regulatory framework There's been some controversy over the removal of a post submitted by Better Markets. The mods gave the reason that it was because of self-promotion. Which, I can't argue with - it definitely looked like self-promotion. So now, I've taken out the important details and summarized them as best as I can. I've put them in bullet points for everyone to discuss.

> First, short selling can be one component of a well-functioning, liquid securities market and can contribute useful information to the price discovery process, under the right regulatory conditions.

To start off, they agree short selling is important to price discovery of highly overvalued (and possibly fraudulent) stocks. Now, like most good things, they can be abused.

> Second, short selling can interfere with fair, orderly, and efficient markets and substantially distort the price discovery process, under the wrong regulatory conditions. It there by can adversely impact the operation and price of capital for companies, especially early stage companies vulnerable to unlawful or abusive short-selling practices.

Big point here is that new companies are especially vulnerable to short selling. Agreed. The main takeaway from their suggestions is that short-selling still has a place, but because of its allure to abusive actors, transparency and proper regulation should be implemented. I think everyone can get behind that. Now, here are their suggestions:

1. Update 13F form requirements to make sure they include standalone short-interest schedule, public reporting of threshold short interests and those involved in securities derivatives, and have it posted monthly instead of quarterly.

2. Implement a securities-lending regulatory and public reporting framework (that was apparently supposed to done through section 984(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010).

3. SEC must require FINRA to setup a system to get brokers to post daily short interest.

4. SEC must require FINRA to publish short-interest volume data daily and monthly short-interest transaction data.

5. Prohibit naked short selling - specifically, remove the market maker's exception to the locate requirement in Regulation SHO.

6. SEC make a short position accountability framework, and include special filing requirements for hard-to-borrow securities. They used "">90% short interest of float"" as an example that would trigger this.

7. Re-instate the uptick rule where short-sales must be done at a price higher than the previous trade.

8. SEC needs to tighten up on failure-to-deliver close-out requirements and enforce them properly. They recommended fees to punish this climb the longer failure-to-delivers remain open.

9. Settlement cycle should be reduced to T+1. They argued this would diminish the amount of phantom shares created.

10. The consolidated audit trail (CAT) need be reformed and properly implemented. They say short selling information should be included in this. In essence, there should be more ease of access and transparency in who borrows what and when.

I think some of these are valid and warrant consideration and discussion.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Western Digital and the great storage shortage. Long $WDC Recently a crypt0-currency called Chia came out as off April 30th, and the unique thing about this coin it, with a bunch of other things, mines on storage. Like hard drives and SSDs. Long story short it was a success, so far, and even before the coin went public articles like this [one](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chia-500-percent-increase-adata-high-capacity-ssd-sales) were talking about shortages of storage devices due to miners buying them in advance. 

You can see the chart below shows the total storage on the network, and it has become parabolic.

[Storage on network](https://preview.redd.it/63yobwxnybx61.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c68e8d1f4a60a71369c5c12d28c96e378b2deb9)

As long as the price maintains its current state of 600+ a Chia, then this should only grow. This is based on some mining calculators that basically say it is still a very profitable endeavor.

WDC is one of the most pure play storage options. They have a significant presence in Asia too, which is important. They make bulk size hard drives, which is what lots of miners want. If Chia coin maintains its explosion and the price stays high, then it WDC will do well. On top of the explosion in PC gaming, which also requires storage, it can lead to a shortage, but typically, companies like Western Digital will do well in those situations.

The game plan?

2Q earnings are going to be awesome, so I will load up on some calls before then, but that isn't till awhile. I think the best thing would be to potentially buy stock, and most importantly, keep  an eye on the stock. Fundamentally they are also great given the good financial position they are in and are set to have a killer year. The current earnings rolled over into the next few months show them in better position then in 2018, where they reached a high of $106.

Position: 10 shares of WDC. Potentially adding options if they ever seem attractive and probably before earnings, unless the thesis changes.

***This is not financial advice. Please trade and invest at your own risk. I own various option positions in WDC.***"

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Case for Canadian Cannabis I've been heavily bullish on ACB for awhile now, some weeks to my detriment and some weeks to my benefit, and I've been constantly hearing about how once America legalizes, American cannabis companies are just gonna magically become the backbone of the cannabis market. So I wanted to make the case for why that's just effectively untrue because of infrastructure and branding.

Starting with infrastructure, a key importance in maintaining national and international markets is supply chain management. You have to be able to move product. American companies can't currently move product across state lines en mass. While my knowledge of the legality of interstate transport is scarce currently, but definitely gonna sign up for a cannabis law course soon, The basics are that movement of recreational marijuana across state lines is interstate trafficking. Therefore, most marijuana companies in America only cultivate local markets. Canadian companies like ACB, TLRY, VFF, etc. have already cultivated national market infrastructure as well as infrastructure to affect international trade. US companies are gonna open at a half-decade disadvantage in this sub-market.

As for recognizable brands, Americans know about Tilray, Aurora, and Village Farms already. Some of us know High Tide and other small American brands, but there aren't any widely known American brands. What I buy at a dispensary in Massachusetts is very different from what someone in Colorado or California buys. In fact, one of the most widely available brands I've seen is Bettie's Eddies, and those are only in 4 states. Canadian companies are starting with marketable brands. I've been wrong before plenty of times, but I don't think it's a stretch to say that these companies would dominate an American marketplace with federal legalization around the corner. Tilray will easily be the mass market distributor of medical cannabis. Aurora will likely be the most recognizable premium cannabis distributor, especially in more hipster oriented markets like Portland, Seattle, LA, New York, etc., and Village Farms will likely be the largest provider of non-premium recreational products. 

While I understand the thought process that American legalization will be a major boon for American companies, the capabilities of these companies seems more and more lacking. With ACB's license to sell in Mexico, it will likely become the largest distributor in North America. With Tilray's positioning as the largest producer of marijuana in the world, it's likely to keep that title and expand further with American legalization. I'm bullish on all of the major Canadian cannabis stocks and loading up to fight the shorts."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Looks like the crayon chart kids are coming out of the wood pile again. Why you should almost never short the S&P500 A bunch of noobs with their crayon charts are coming back to tell you why you should short the S&P500.  I'm here to tell you that they are mostly idiots and you will almost surely not make money doing it as a long term play.

Story time:  Back in 2019, long before gmreeeee,  this sub had less than a million subscribers and we talked about things like earnings plays, the nasdaq 100, the infinite leverage kid, TrAdE TalKs GoiNg WelL, and Donald Pump.  Back then you could make free money by just buying tech calls or literally anything for that matter.  In February 2020 the S&P500 was ripping higher and higher on increasingly worse news:  mass covid outbreaks, trade talks going to shit, Jerome Powell doing NotQE and bonds flipping their shit.   Then one sunday night spooz opened sharply lower and drill team 6 went to work.  These dudes were causing circuit breaker after circuit breaker and options liquidity went to shit across the board.  Implied volatility was so high that a call ten strikes above market was basically the same price as the atm ones.  Then, when we thought it couldn't get any worse, Putin said that Russia was not going to cut production at OPEC and crude futures plummeted.  The price action was so crazy that front month crude futures settled at negative prices.  This means that you had to pay people to take your oil.  Then, all of a sudden, the market rebounded and all the smug shorts got their asses handed to them as the S&P500 went  through multiple circuit breaking weeks of face ripping rallies.  So, what happened and why should you not bet against the S&P500?

&#x200B;

1. The S&P500 has the most liquid options market in the world and the way in which options are hedged means that market makers are usually forced to buy after extended drawdowns.  Large institutions like pension funds have a tremendous amount of equities on their books and these assets need to be hedged in times of stress.  When a big risk event comes along these big dogs will buy puts to protect their holdings.  They will also sell calls using their equities as collateral to bring in some premium throughout the year regardless of risk.  The market makers are on the other side of this trade, so that are usually assumed to be long calls and short puts.  Let's just look at short puts for now.  If you are a market maker then you want to eliminate your directional risk.  Since short puts will lose you money if the underlying goes down you can short shares to hedge your short put.  Remember now that puts have two huge components that determine price:  volatility and how close the market is to the strike.  When a bunch of short puts are in the money then it will have a high delta.  This means that the MM's will need to short a ton of shares to hedge the large delta.  The big kicker here is that, for one, volatility is mean reverting, and two, that the option will eventually expire.  When volatility mean reverts, as it must since risk is not constant in our world, the deltas on the short call will reduce.  Less delta means that MMs are short too many shares and they need to buy (this is the effect of vanna).  Hence vix drop = share buys (in general, not always).  The second factor is that eventually the options will expire and hence the market maker will no longer need to short into dips to hedge their gamma, meaning there is less selling pressure.  They might even need to buy to get flat from all the short stock they have after their options expire.  It is no coincidence that the huge rally we saw in 2020 off the covid lows happened the day after a massive amount of in the money options expired during March quad witching.  If you want to read more about this stuff here is a good resource.

2.    Bond  yields are incredibly low and this creates a risk on appetite.  If you are rich where do you put your money right now?  If you put it in bonds then you are not even going to beat inflation and, moreover, if yields spike, your bond will be worth significantly less.  These factors make bonds with long duration a risk both immediately and also in opportunity cost.  We can put our money into an asset that will do nothing or we can put it into a large index like the S&P500 where, over 10 years, we know that we can probably get at least 20% out of it.  The best part is that big money can easily hedge its directional risk by buying puts and, if needed, sell calls against holdings to pay for the put.  This means big $$$ can get protection for free.  All this infers that there is a natural flow of money  into the market.  Evaluations might be crazy high right now but they start to make more sense when you adjust it for bond yields.  Dr Edward Yardeni has a blog that talks about this more in depth.

Now, of course, this stuff could be wrong and a well articulated counter point can be found on Dr. Lacy Hunt's open letters.

3.  The S&P500 is comprised of the best 500 companies America has to offer.  They are the ones that will THRIVE when conditions are tough because their competition will most likely not make it.

4.  What's the market going to fall on?  Trillions in stimulus?

\------------------------------------------------------------

Know that all the things I mentioned above are very real structural reasons for why shorting the S&P is a very dangerous play.  If you want to scalp the short side then I don't think there are any issues, but holding a short position for any time longer than a week means that you are working against all the factors I mentioned above.  When will the S&P500 be overvalued?  Well, if we adjust for bond yields probably at 7000-8000 on the spx.   So sit back and enjoy the free money.  Don't over leverage on the long side because big down moves do happen, but why not just buy a few call debit spreads that expire in a month and profit off of an unstoppable juggernaut?  Buy one call in the money and sell one call out the money.  Until the 10 year has yields over 5%, or until China invades Taiwan I think we don't have much to worry about."

I believe there is a HUGE inflation trade here... I haven't, dug into the fundamentals, but the equities are trading at astronomically low P/E ratio with the current Lumber future prices. Something like a P/E of 3-4-5??

The equities are SO mis-priced compared to the historical pricings. Particularly when opposed to the 2018 peak.

Just using CANFOR here, but same goes for any Lumber sawmill companies.

I believe if we could surpass the equities price of 2018, we could see an easy 50% upside.

Wondering if anyone could share some light? Or thoughts...

Hell, he might force the board to simply pile the cash into huge account and wait for the cycle to pass while the cash sits with little to no interest. Share will be down since the cycle will have turned and the market will be punishing Canfor double cause of the terrible use of the cash.

2021-05-05 21:38:35,wallstreetbets,"Here is my bull case counter: Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Coinbase is gonna be huge because this is the first time we are going to be able to directly play crypto in the equity market. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin AND all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict. Another advantage of COIN being the first crypto exchange coming onto the market first is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value."

Missed EPS estimates by a penny and revenue by 240 mill, but still cleared quite a bit and was profitable.

I have never used margin. all I have in my account are spreads. these terrible people didn't let me use my available cash balance to make trades which cost me significantly as several stocks in my portfolio were moving
2021-05-06 09:07:28,wallstreetbets,This is the problem with society. We don't hire based on qualification we hire for other wacky reasons and people suck at their jobs. Slowly causing economic collapse.
2021-05-06 09:23:40,wallstreetbets,"Etrade cost me about $80 grand during the initial GME madness because their system literally refused to process orders for an hour and locked me out of being able to buy or sell. My other accounts at Vanguard and Schwab functioned just fine, only E*TRADE decided to fuck everything up hardcore.

They’ve been offering huge money for people to move accounts over but fuck that. The only thing I’d use them for is super boring bullshit like buying and holding SPY forever"

I became numb to it after day 1, but can’t imagine how I would’ve first reacted had that number been red."

2021-05-05 21:56:52,wallstreetbets,About 10 years ago I used them for a month.  They charged me $US - $C exchange on every trade I made.   It cost me $C4000 to realize they are bandits and horse thieves.

Etrade is By Far The Most Legit"
2021-05-05 22:39:01,wallstreetbets,"Does anyone have experience with both E*Trade and Fidelity, beyond the GME stuff? I’ve been an E*Trade user for ~14 years for my individual brokerage account, but my company uses Fidelity for 401K, so I’ve consolidated my retirement accounts there. I generally prefer the E*Trade app, which is where I do the majority of my actual trading (try not to F around with my retirement $ much), but perhaps it’s because there’s where I spend more time and have the most experience. 

I use the apps almost exclusively - really only login to desktop sites around tax time, or once in a blue moon. I’m not a pro investor by any means, but maybe have 50-60 long positions open and a handful of level 1-2 options. 

I’ve also seen a few glitches here and there, but as another commenter posted, typically easy to identify as a temporary error and generally in my (very short term) favor. For instance, I woke up one morning (before bell) up 6000% on a future call option that I was only up 25% on at market close the day before. When I clicked into it, it was easy to see that I was indeed still not a millionaire, and it rectified itself within 10 minutes. That said, I’d love to just have all my stuff in a single brokerage, so I’ve considered moving everything to Fidelity. Especially since crypto now has me using a 3rd brokerage (Coinbase). Anyone have experience moving from one to the next in an actual position transfer (not cash out and rebuy) with options?"
2021-05-05 22:53:06,wallstreetbets,Get out (while you still can)
2021-05-05 23:10:32,wallstreetbets,This just in - the entire financial system is a grift. Elites make millions trading billions back and forth without a dollar of that being paid for goods or services. The productive part of the economy has been enslaved to the banking system.

2021-05-06 00:45:06,wallstreetbets,Have you tried RH?
2021-05-06 01:39:29,wallstreetbets,I reported etrade to the sec and they actually replied they would look into the case and sent the information to etrade. This was during any high frequency trading of meme stocks bid and ask price actually worked in inverse of actual price. Only using etrade alone you would have never known and used market orders to buy and sell or you wouldn't get in or out of the stocks. I had a third party market scanner platform I was using and the prices showed dead on to what actual price was and I was able to work around the discrepancy. I videod the problem and took several pictures during market hours to back up my claims. I first reached out to etrade and was given the here is the door we have no issues reported. So I made a sec complaint that complaint got re routed to etrade for a response and the one I got was bad. In the contract you sign it states they are not to be held liable at any time for any Incorrect market data they show you. So that essentially means they have it legally written they can screw you around to make back losses and you can do nothing about it nor can the sec because you signed the initial agreement to use the platform.

2021-05-05 21:39:53,wallstreetbets,Fidelity ceo (or maybe cfo?) did an ama and said as much. They also have a second app (can’t remember then and) and it’s nice and clean and more “robinhoodish” if you will. If they’d just make one nice ass app they’d get people flocking to them.

2021-05-06 17:09:35,wallstreetbets,"Not to knock TDA, but I’m not gonna switch to another.

They’ve been offering $3500 if you move over a million or more in investments but there’s no fucking way I trust these idiots with serious money. There’s a reason Fidelity and Schwab don’t need to outright bribe people with that much"
2021-05-06 10:23:31,wallstreetbets,I am on eTrade and can confirm that eTrade did in fact restrict buying of GME for at least 2 days.  You can check my post history.  During this time the only brokerages that did not restrict GME buying were Schwab and Fidelity.

2021-05-05 20:21:35,wallstreetbets,Yes TDA restricted buying. I tried.
2021-05-06 11:02:16,wallstreetbets,We're you trying to buy with margin? Because they didn't allow that. They allowed cash accounts to buy as much as they wanted
2021-05-06 11:04:27,wallstreetbets,This is exactly what happens

It's free to get an account and the premium is pretty cheap."
2021-05-06 11:03:14,wallstreetbets,No. They would allow the purchase of 1 share. It’s a margin account.
2021-05-06 11:07:23,wallstreetbets,">No. It’s a margin account.



That's what I just said. They allowed buying with cash accounts. Not margin. Unless now you're saying that you were able to buy with margin but was limited with the amount"
2021-05-06 11:11:38,wallstreetbets,"Yes that is specifically what I am saying. I had sufficient funds in the account to purchase shares without leverage so I don’t understand the logic of “cash accounts only”.

I have a margin account, buying wasn’t eliminated, it was restricted to one share on TDA."
2021-05-06 11:46:34,wallstreetbets,"Hmm that's funky. I dont have a margin account on TD and was able to buy as much as I wanted at the time. If I had to guess, they did a quick fix (it did happen overnight) where they flagged margin accounts and only allowed the purchase of 1 share whereas non margin accounts weren't flagged for it."

Just acknowledge what you said. Just looking at your recent history, you've said RKT doubled last earnings at least 3 times. That was your basis for defending bullish plays.

It's not true.

It didn't double, not even that close.

And the spike that *did* occur was not based on good earnings.

It doesn’t seem like it, but it’s a really short period of time you have been invested in PLTR.  It seems to me it will be a trillion dollar company in 5 years."

Interactive Brokers isn’t as user-friendly, but they’re on the IEX, so that’s a plus (always seem to get the friendliest price there).  Biggest advantage with them is access to foreign markets (many that aren’t available at other brokers).

2021-05-05 23:42:50,wallstreetbets,"I was referring specifically to the transference of hundreds of trillions, perhaps *quadrillions* of dollars transnationally from the Ponzi scheme oligarchy to the masses. 

This will be an economic revolution in every sense. An immediate 180 from trickle-down to geyser-up. It’s going to be absolutely historic and possibly world-changing. 

The influx of tax revenue to governments, combined with the possible collapse of many major banks, could be the catalyst we’ve needed for basic income. All of a sudden, those who have the greatest stake in climate change (the young) will grip the levers of power and resources to take action on it. There has never been an economic stimulus like what we’re about to see, and the pandemic recovery is going to blow away anyone’s expectations or, indeed, wildest dreams.

HODLGME can absolutely be viewed as an endeavour to save (and transform) human civilization."

2021-05-06 12:38:47,wallstreetbets,"If NIO were to do 95k, 140k & 220k in 2020,2021 & 2022 as per Edison Yu meaning that NeoPark was not needed until 2023

What would happen to the Top Dozen CCP Officials of Anhui / Hefei who blessed spending $7.5 Billion on Phase 1 NeoPark

I have been reading Books on China -- I think CCP Members in Anhui Hefei would be gone in disgrace if Edison Yu numbers were right. CCP Anhui/ Hefei will want new Capacity up in record quick time so they get plaudits from Center. If first JAC factory took 16 months from start to finish, the second one could take less time.

Especially if Center gives even a small push

2022 will be 10th year of President Xi as Head of CCP. What better way to celebrate than Ribbon Cutting on the World's Biggest EV Manufacturing Hub producing the most Technologically Advanced Luxury Auto ever produced

Can you imagine the Field Day Chinese Media would have on that event

All of this is much bigger than NIO, it is about China's move to Top Status in Luxury, Quality, Technology, EV, AV & to remove the Shame/ Stigma of the World laughing at Chinese Car Quality for the past 50 years

Edison Yu is pretty young -- So surprised that NONE of the NIO Analyst get it. Just like all being wrong on Q1. Your subscription numbers were not ""wrong"" but impossible to perfectly estimate"
