2021-06-14 18:48:37,wallstreetbets,Nah this rides to expiration out of money. No turning back. I took out my initial $5k.
2021-06-14 18:49:28,wallstreetbets,Then short it.
2021-06-14 18:49:20,wallstreetbets,Sell it.
2021-06-14 18:56:18,wallstreetbets,"I bought the calls two weeks out thinking the Safran conference for the clean and efficient engines or the deleveraging news would get it up a bit, but somehow all the good news made it drop 7% since I bought. It’s been 11 consecutive drops. 11. This ape has worse timing than “guh”"
2021-06-14 18:58:35,wallstreetbets,This play was up to $150k at one point. $20k is all that’s left. Account is now restricted because it has less than $25k.

2021-06-14 19:44:10,wallstreetbets,It’s after the quad witch so maybe. That’s what I thought after last week. Last week it dropped 5% with 1 green day. If it breaks $13.42 support after the gapup it’s not stopping until $13.00. So wait for it to move.
2021-06-14 19:11:57,wallstreetbets,You can't just eat the extra chromosomes and expect things to work out
2021-06-14 19:18:29,wallstreetbets,Absolutely! 🤣

2021-06-14 19:37:16,wallstreetbets,All good money was made on GE? Mind breaking down how you did it? Still impressive 5k to 150k
2021-06-14 19:40:54,wallstreetbets,No point in selling it now
2021-06-14 18:51:43,wallstreetbets,"We’ll I hope you had fun at our casino! 
Good luck next time"
2021-06-14 19:16:05,wallstreetbets,Yolo it into SPY dude. If you are going to let it go to zero anyway. You can watch it ping pong around and  it’ll either go to 0 anyway. Or you’ll 5-6x whatever’s left.
2021-06-14 19:52:45,wallstreetbets,Bro you can still sell. I loss a ton on calls that I let expire because my pride couldn't take the hour. 3 months later I regret that decision. You could also just sell and buy new calls at a later date if your pride demands it
2021-06-14 19:13:29,wallstreetbets,Nope. That’s not how this works. We stay with the extra one.

2021-06-14 19:01:02,wallstreetbets,Nothing because I would’ve never taken it out. Just kept on yoloing it into random shit.
2021-06-14 19:29:40,wallstreetbets,"Yolo that into gme or amc,  thoae are the crazy long shots.
Dayum dude!!!"
2021-06-14 18:38:53,wallstreetbets,"Nice work, thank you. I might add this tomorrow. I was thinking TCL earlier in the year, as well.

All I have for a tip right now is GMGI — Golden Matrix, Inc. It’s an online gambling software provider that has been on a really nice track since last year. They are getting close to a NASDAQ uplist, so I’m anticipating another big run sometime in the near future. If you have the time, take a look.

This is not financial advice, I’m not a professional, etc, etc, etc."

2021-06-14 19:17:13,wallstreetbets,You still think TCL has merit?
2021-06-14 19:17:39,wallstreetbets,Good. Less shares to go around so the more that are bought the quicker it goes up and the harder it is to sell down
2021-06-14 18:13:10,wallstreetbets,"Same here, I think they're really gonna surprise people on their next earnings"

2021-06-14 18:18:52,wallstreetbets,Wish constantly is screwing people over. Send horrible look alike clothes. Never send product. People in the US should not buy them products or their stock.

2021-06-14 19:54:43,wallstreetbets, I WISH I  could give this comment 3 thumbs up! Bought some more today and will tomorrow now. Power up!
2021-06-14 19:40:54,wallstreetbets,"My general sentiment is jf WSB mods continuously allow several low effort posts on a specific ticker, that means it’s blindly being pumped. Not always true but there’s certainly a trend

It’s so fishy that posters and “commenters” quickly respond with robotic type grammar and of course they were all account ages starting in January if you catch my drift"
2021-06-14 18:20:49,wallstreetbets,We $WISH you would stop. $WISH is a well$wisher of humanity and we love it!!
2021-06-14 19:30:21,wallstreetbets,"I'll day trade Wish while it's volatile. But the one time I considered buying something on there it wasn't worth the hassle. Their website is the worst marketplace I've ever seen. AliExpress, DHGate, GearBest, FastTech, eBay, WalMart and Amazon are all much better. The only thing I've seen people pleased with from Wish is $15 knock off watches. But those same guys wouldn't dare risk buying a $50+ counterfeit watch on there."
2021-06-14 19:56:21,wallstreetbets,"I’m seriously see what you are talking about, I’m heavily invested in WI$H. So I try to see who’s posting what and when they started. But a lot of movement on other social media sites."
2021-06-14 17:59:38,wallstreetbets,It’ll either moon nicely or crash and burn. Please moon

You can see in the chart that it does NOT like passing the standard means deviation (the beige in the middle). So, it's strongly heading back down, perhaps to the half deviation at around $34. At that point, it may go back up for a retest. Or back down where it's been liking it for a while.

Remember their supercapacitors... Well that was shelved 4 years back... How about their solid state batteries, which were the biggest thing and that was shelve a few months back.

I guess they are drawing pictures of pretty cars and will have some new pictures to keep investors happy. I seriously doubt they ever get to production. Remember Henrik Fisker at his prior company did manage to bring a vehicle to production but ultimately it was not enough to save the company from defaulting on its loans. The moment Fisker Inc gets serious about producing a vehicle their costs will skyrocket and bankruptcy will be coming at them soon after. Using third-party to manufacture the vehicle will not avoid the costs to bring a car to production. The third-party is not taking on the major costs and risks here."

His previous company went bankrupt because the battery supplier went bankrupt. The reality is he was too new to the game and the technology, nor him, were ready. His previous bankruptcy is an asset to Fisker today, not a liability. 

“Using third party [Magna] will not avoid costs of production. They won’t take on the risks.”

This isn’t so much a case of what ifs as people expect, this is literally what Magna is already doing. The whole reason they exist is for reasons like this. They already have the economies of scale to do this. They do it for Ford, Tesla, Mercedes, Volks, etc and I know you will say that they can afford to do it but the reality is Magna can do it for anyone because they already have undergone the high fixed costs of entry in the automotive space. You are severely underestimating Magna. They’re a very seasoned 30b company who know what they are getting into"

Do you think this strategy would also work with QQQ or would the volatility kill you ?  Maybe you could also backtest it ? :P 

And also for the DCA, you say you have to buy a call with a 40 delta with 380 days out. Those calls on SPY and QQQ are about 19k. So that means every month you have to put in around 20k in leaps for 2 years ? that's a pretty substantial sum of money that you have to already have or make a shitton from your job right ?"

2021-06-14 19:10:48,wallstreetbets,"It is interesting... When QS was subjected to a short report the CEO Mr. Singh in an interview with Sandy Munro (on YouTube) had no problem criticizing points in the short report. With Tesla, I feel there have been numerous short attacks made against it and at no time do I recall Elon Musk needing help to respond... But RIDE.... well they need a law firm to respond. That right away is never a good thing. Lawyers are hired, not to dispute the short report with facts, but to write a response that does not expose the company to legal liability.

How about looking at some choice legalize... At least investors in RIDE should appreciate the lawyers they are paying...

>*""The Special Committee concluded that while various factors could lead to delays in the start of production, the projected September 2021 start of production remains achievable with the expectation of delivery to customers in the first quarter of 2022.""*

So let's see... the projected date remains achievable... what does that even mean. What various factors can lead to delays. How likely is it that they get to production then. And then what do you even mean by start of production? If deliveries are in the first quarter of 2022 does this mean that in ""theory"" production could be (achievable) started in Sep 2021, but you more realistically expect it to start it later (maybe in Q1' 2022)... but the company is running out of cash now so that can't be good.

>*""The Hindenburg Report cites a purported statement from an anonymous former Lordstown Motors’ employee that Lordstown Motors* ***switched from plastic frames to aluminum frames*** *earlier this year. That is false. While Lordstown Motors made certain changes to the materials to be used for the doors, hoods, and fenders,* ***there has been no change to its plan to manufacture the vehicle frame from steel****""*

One has to wonder did the lawyers even read the short report? The short report, and I quote, says, *""totally switched from a plastic exterior to aluminum"".* Correct me if I am wrong, the exterior and frames are two different parts of the truck...

>Lordstown Motors has sourced battery cells from suppliers, and initial battery pack assembly equipment has been received and is being installed, with remaining equipment due to arrive in advance of the projected start of production date.

So want to be clear here... They are receiving equipment before Sep 2021, but they still need to set it up and get it working properly, which tells us nothing about when they can actually get to production, just tells us they are receiving the equipment before the projected start of production date, which remains achievable but is not expected to happen.

>the hub motor technology licensed from Elaphe is viable. The Endurance was engineered to address the unsprung vehicle mass attributable to in-wheel motors, including through tuning of the suspension, reinforcing the vehicle structure, and utilizing a heavier truck chassis. These measures are expected to alleviate any ride or durability issues that might otherwise arise.

It is viable for what? And what is this about needing to tune the suspension, reinforce the vehicle, and make it heavier... This is an EV we are talking about. Weight kills range. Also, overengineering the truck to deal with issues with in-hub motors, seems the opposite of making the truck easier to build.

>During a test drive, the driver accelerated beyond the expected test parameters for that prototype.

Pray tell us what the expected test parameters were? 20 mph? Or is this acceleration and not speed you are talking about, and the circuit could not handle the peak power here. Whatever, who cares, let's see a proper test vehicle.

Not going to bother  with the rest of this, but man that point about plastic and steel exterior being mixed up with the frame shows you that either RIDE or its lawyers can't even read properly."

The Lordstown Complex consists of four main facilities in one location, in addition to multiple support buildings: (1) General Assembly, (2) a Body Shop, (3) Stamping and (4) a Paint Shop. The Lordstown Complex is in near- production-ready condition with modern robotics, painting, assembly and stamping equipment and requires a retooling investment in order to commence full production of the Endurance.  
Construction is in process on an 800,000 square foot propulsion production area, which will house production lines for in-wheel motors and lithium-ion battery packs, and is expected in time for the targeted start of limited production of the Endurance in late September 2021.  
As part of these retooling efforts, we will purchase and install new machines, tooling, fixtures and quality and testing equipment, make additional investments in software, control and other information technology systems, modify conveyor and robotics systems, convert the existing paint line from dry powder to a “wet on wet” process and create new hub motor and battery packing assembly lines.  
We expect to complete the retooling in the first half of 2021 in order to enable limited production of the Endurance to commence as expected in late September 2021.

>SAVANNAH, GA (WTOC) - The Securities and Exchange Commission won $1.8 million in a lawsuit against Moon River Studios, also known as Medient.The company and its top officials – including Jake Shapiro - were accused of securities fraud after they bailed out of a multi-million dollar project to build the nation's largest movie studio in Effingham County, allegedly taking millions from investors, employees and county tax dollars.In a WTOC Investigation in May of 2016, Moon River Studios had spent $6 million but had nothing to show for it, despite entering into a private/public partnership with Effingham County to build the movie studio complex.In September, the SEC filed a lawsuit against the company accusing them of falsifying press releases and corporate filings, in addition to back-dating documents.

Interesting analysis.

Nikola has been around for 5 years now. Their only sales have been for a handful of poorly designed t-shirts that look like something you'd find on RedBubble. They continue to announce new vehicles, but every single one somehow gets canceled after a few years. 

Their next big vehicle is scheduled for 2022/2023. It's the same cycle. You'd be better off buying shares in Baltia, the fake airline that's been around since the 80s but has yet to offer a single flight in company history."

It's the same as a paid expert witness, you can find an expert to say anything, and that's what they did.

Short report called their inability to start production on time is accurate as the intention was clear they reference full scale commercial production.  If I start building 2 trucks a week I can say I've started production, even if it's at a level that won't add up to anything.  That's what your paid report from Lordstown lawyers is saying.  As long as they technically start building 1 damn vehicle they are technically not lying.

Short report called out their pre orders, that is absolutely confirmed to be an over inflated number that they paid firms to source pre orders.  I bet every early stock holder put in a pre order as they didn't have to put down cash.  Then they started with the 100 dollar refundable deposit, again not stopping anyone from inflating the demand."

Overall:CRSR is a strong company that, apparently, has a surprisingly high amount of shorts. Why do I say surprisingly?

* Strong fundamental business that has showed absolutely zero signs of a post-pandemic slowdown in the gaming peripheral market
* Continued guidance every earnings call upwards (and beating estimates consistently)
* Analysts have it pegged at \~$50/share by end of year which is why I am shocked it has \~20% short against it
* I'd need to check but I think it's P/E ratio is below Logitech. That was why I bought in originally at IPO as it should have run to \~$40 to match (sold @ $45 rebought in at $31)

This is just a strong company in general that isn't AMC or GME (and others) which is selling on future potential or some gamesmanship. Literally CRSR should be higher than it is based on both industry averages and analysis."

Listen though, when i do my DD on this stock i've been gobbling up, you'll get a mention to make up those losses."
2021-06-14 17:10:51,wallstreetbets,"As sad as it is, I think the Europeans pumped it, and the Americans dumped it. It still ended on a high, and above the 35 resistance line it had been trying to get past, but I think due to the nature of this it'll go back below.

Which sucks, because the company is a great company and when I bought it it would have had a P/E ratio below 15 in 2023 if analyst expectations were merely met. Which is crazy good for a growth company. 

But because of the IV, and the nature of what i knew was going to be a pump and dump i sold the calls. I wouldn't have sold those calls Friday if i knew people were going to go at it like that. 

Regardless, HEAR was pretty lucrative for me. Sold it at 37, but it's still going up and it will probably hit 39-40 and then hit upper resistance. Gaming stocks are in a good sweet spot in terms of hardware."

2021-06-14 16:38:03,wallstreetbets,Zynga stock literally never moves
2021-06-14 17:16:57,wallstreetbets,Cramer? Is that you?
2021-06-14 16:38:59,wallstreetbets,I very much so believe zyngas day is coming
2021-06-14 16:41:25,wallstreetbets,"Zynga is trending sidewise quite a bit but the last ER's are solid. They are also more advertise focused and I'm sure they will break out this year.

Long $ZNGA calls $12 Jan 2023"
2021-06-14 17:59:51,wallstreetbets,Sloths move faster than this stock.
2021-06-14 16:49:33,wallstreetbets,"this is a dumpster dive at a Wendys, high on crack looking for its next fix, stock"
2021-06-14 19:32:29,wallstreetbets,"You forgot that Zynga is rumored to unveil their Star Wars Hunters game.  Not sure if it's supposed to be a mobile game, or for a platform.  From what I read, think mixture of battlefront and fortnite"
2021-06-14 18:01:52,wallstreetbets,I play with your wife like it’s a video game
2021-06-14 18:44:59,wallstreetbets,Zynga has been paying royalties for most of the companies they acquire. It’s a multi year deal with said companies and it will continue to bend Zynga over until they expire. Give it another year or two. ZYNGA was my first trade back in March 2020
2021-06-14 18:51:51,wallstreetbets,"Bruh. Good luck, I lost money in Zynga for so long. I won't even be mad if it does moon (it won't) but like I say - good luck!"
2021-06-14 19:03:18,wallstreetbets,Wasn’t FarmVille like a thing about a hundred years ago?
2021-06-14 16:47:04,wallstreetbets,You lie. It moved down after I bought some...
2021-06-14 17:01:24,wallstreetbets,"I have bought leaps in Zynga twice, including the expiration of my currently owned ones they will have spanned more than two years.

Can confirm. Once a quarter you’ll get some good movement only to lose it all in a couples days and be right back where it started"
2021-06-14 17:37:33,wallstreetbets,That's absolutely true. And that's what we usually see of stocks before major moves.  Long periods of sideways movement then BAM they shoot up (or drop down if they've been at highs for a while) since ZNGA has been held down for so long I suspect a more upward movement soon.
2021-06-14 17:37:34,wallstreetbets,Exactly!
2021-06-14 17:45:43,wallstreetbets,Haha
2021-06-14 17:38:30,wallstreetbets,Is he a ZNGA fan?
2021-06-14 17:05:52,wallstreetbets,"They do their own advertising, which is a win-win on that end. Allows them to improve on anything else which would be needed by the company."
2021-06-14 17:40:56,wallstreetbets,"100%. ZNGA has a lot of potential and the sideways movement is a positive thing for me because no huge swings in price mean that when it does move (and it will) it will be going up due to solid fundamentals.

Or perhaps Microsoft will acquire ZNGA since it's such a great deal now...But I'm not big on acquisition plays."
2021-06-14 16:56:55,wallstreetbets,Are you trying to tell me to buy?
2021-06-14 19:05:24,wallstreetbets,I think you meant to say: …”like SHE’S a video game “
2021-06-14 16:56:14,wallstreetbets,We have the power to move the markets downward whenever we choose to buy anything 😂
2021-06-14 17:37:46,wallstreetbets,Haha
2021-06-14 19:03:35,wallstreetbets,"Well, yeah."
2021-06-14 18:10:05,wallstreetbets,Cramer has had this as a buy since like 2013 so his magic 8 ball is big time broken……
2021-06-14 17:28:19,wallstreetbets,"of course not. Drugs are bad, mmmkay"

2021-06-14 19:39:22,wallstreetbets,"This was excellent DD! Thank you! Also, worth noting that WISH is in my opinion Gameifying the e-commerce sector with it's spin the wheel attraction and just the whole app is like a shopping spree on steroids. I think their market opportunities are massive, it will be tweaked to reduce shipping costs and time lapse. IMO Wish is a huge home-run, It's origins are the app, so much more user friendly than Amazon which would probably need a lot of coding work and shutting down the site to achieve a more Wish like experience. Wish will be massive, the team of execs is a top notch cut from a different cloth kind of group that will continue to execute super intelligent high growth strategies to take more market share and become the next best e-commerce platform."
2021-06-14 17:01:25,wallstreetbets,When $WISH hits $35 and everyone starts piling in is precisely when I dump all my bags on em 🤌🏻

2021-06-14 16:37:48,wallstreetbets,"If this counts as DD, I'm a monkey's uncle.

Wish is Chinesium counterfeit of every Etsy account in your neighborhood. I would YOLO North Korea before I believe Wish will deliver, ""Higher quality fulfilment"" and, ""improving product quality""."

2021-06-14 17:48:35,wallstreetbets,I can confirm this as I have calls expiring this Friday.
2021-06-14 18:59:30,wallstreetbets,"I think they are pre-Q1 earnings, so some have moved down by quite a bit.

I see Oppenheimer is $23, BofA is $20, Cowen is $18, Stifel is $12.

But once Q2 results come out, will prob go right back to $30."
2021-06-14 16:39:32,wallstreetbets,"Did you even read the DD?  This guy makes excellent points on the significance of the PrestaShop deal, Wish Local locations, and Executive Chair Jacqueline Reses experience with Square, and how it could all tie together to increase $WISH's value.  Remember that the appeal of $WISH isn't just its meme status and ticker, but also that it's actually a growth stock well below its fair value and price targets from the big boys:

Investment Bank | $WISH Price Target
---|---
Evercore ISI | $22
UBS | $28
Stifel | $22
Oppenheimer | $30
Loop Capital | $22
JP Morgan | $30
Goldman | $19
Deutsche Bank | $26
Credit Suisse | $31
Citigroup | $24
BofA Securities | $26


This all makes it a much safer YOLO."

2021-06-14 17:12:16,wallstreetbets,I don't give a flying fuck if their counterfeits print me extra money. I'd take almost $1400 in one day of trading from a company that specializes in raping children.
2021-06-14 17:07:14,wallstreetbets,Thursday. Maybe Friday after the market open dip... watch out for when all the Wallstreet suits unload so they can pay off their weekend escorts.

2021-06-14 16:50:45,wallstreetbets,Someone forgot to switch burner accounts to comment
2021-06-14 17:18:00,wallstreetbets,"Clearly you haven't actually listed how many institutions  own this at what percentage  and naming a few on options doesn't clarify it as dd ... also why not take a look at who owns the float  what's the short interest telling some one a story about what could be potential and what It really is its sounds like a sales pitch ... reality sets in with and a bigger one is you saying meme stock  here ... I will leave my case in point  people don't be gullible  with what people tell you do your own research before taking some one else's ""dd"""
2021-06-14 17:20:50,wallstreetbets,And if there price target on options are that high that means there the ones making money and your the one left holding the bag
2021-06-14 17:33:47,wallstreetbets,Who owns the Float? What percentage do the big institutions own? What is the short interest?
2021-06-14 18:21:23,wallstreetbets,Oh shit! Haha
2021-06-14 18:24:31,wallstreetbets,I didn’t know Kevin durant was on wsb!
2021-06-14 19:47:45,wallstreetbets,Do you know what an option is?
2021-06-14 18:52:32,wallstreetbets,These price targets have nothing to do with options… They are just analysts’ estimates for what the stock should be.  These analysts are walled off from their buyside counterparts within their firms.
2021-06-14 18:57:50,wallstreetbets,Again then there is nothing on facts or paper this is an assumption  🤣🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
2021-06-14 19:01:01,wallstreetbets,"Huh?  So you’re saying analyst targets don’t mean anything?  That’s honestly fine if you believe that, but not sure why you think we should throw out these data points."
2021-06-14 19:06:27,wallstreetbets,So people go based on opinions  and not facts ?? Are you a snake oil salesman .... give the numbers of insitution that own wish where is all that info tell me the float si and give me the options calls ... if you can't provide it  here you shouldn't be here promoting something  you know nothing about ... clear pump and dump without actually answer those questions
2021-06-14 19:17:42,wallstreetbets,"I have no clue what you're trying to say.  How are analyst price targets not facts?  It's a data point.

&#x200B;

Why don't you do the research and tell me, if you care so much about the SI? Has anyone on this particular thread mentioned the SI other than you? I don't give a shit what you buy."
2021-06-14 19:21:48,wallstreetbets,Lmao if you don't know what I am saying then you shouldn't be an investor or have an opinion about something you don't know about .... I don't have to do research  for you and tell you .....why should I spoon feed you ??? Too lazy to look it up ??  It's clearly because people now adays post up some opinion articles and place it as facts when it's not..... an opinion piece ..

2021-06-14 16:32:04,wallstreetbets,"Today was rough considering it opened at $4.58. Does drop greater than 10% from the days high qualify the ticket for the SSR, or is that only a 10% drop from open?

2021-06-14 16:31:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah we were up 14% early this morning and there is no negative news. Shorties plain and simple

I'm not bearish, medium to long term, but this recent spike is divorced from the fundamentals of the company. If it burns too many investors, they won't get in when it's time to moon around September. Adding position after the ER is the play. LEAPS and shares."
2021-06-14 18:40:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah in worst case I exercise and get shares for long term 😂

2021-06-14 18:08:33,wallstreetbets,"So If MC and LSC lost ~6 BILLION in the month of May that could mean that they almost have the entire float shorted. 
 
May GME:
START = $162.19
END = $249.03
DELTA = $86,84

Then we devide that 6B by $86,84 and we get...

69.092.584

So IF all of their short positions are GME they need the whole float to have lost 6B. 

Please correct me if im wrong.

2021-06-14 19:59:11,wallstreetbets,"Just day traders exiting before they get a day trade call. CRSR isn't going anywhere because its volume was mostly market maker call hedging, and its dips were clearly at price intervals representing significant returns on those calls being gamma scalped. Given it has super strong resistance at 40 from the months of trading it did there, and that this appears to be a flash in the pan meme rotation, I wouldn't expect it to have legs."

How do you get around the “if you sell this security before your other sale clears you’ll be banned by the SEC for 90 days bullshit”?

2021-06-14 16:38:37,wallstreetbets,Holding CLNE and WISH long term. Both have had higher highs than what we have seen even prior to WSB. Both are legit imo. Just take WISH for example that IPO’ed at $24 and hit as high as $30+ early on in the year. Even if you think WISH is just worth its original evaluation at IPO it’s a double your investment opportunity and this is all prior to WSB… I’ll sell both around $30

at $36 CRSR is exactly where it was in the last 3 months of its range.

2021-06-14 19:25:55,wallstreetbets,Lmao WSB is so so terrible and transparently rampant with hedge fund shills post original GME. It’s the same awful shit with terrible DD’s that literally make no sense. When I first got here I thought we all just called each other retards for fun...but now that I can see through shills I see that 95%+ of the accounts here could actually be chromosonians

2021-06-14 18:57:53,wallstreetbets,"What makes any of you fucking idiots think that CRSR is going to do anything except *maybe* crawl up to 38-39 in pre-open, then crash while your fellow WSBers pump the name here in highly awarded posts while they quietly sell off and send it back to 31 by Friday? Jesus Christ, the only thing worse than pumpers is CNBC and Bloomberg tripping all over themselves to cover “WallStreetBets’ Latest Meme Stonk” just in time to suck all the degenerate gamblers who should be quietly chainsmoking next to Reno slot machines and sipping on 7 and 7s while they wait to die but have downloaded RobinHood.

A stock isn't your child.  A single stock isn't a path to financial freedom for ~99.999999999% of people. 

You become emotionally invested in a stock and you're toast.  Treat stocks like disposable silverware, or your ticket to wait in line at the BMV/DMV, use it and lose it.  The exceptions are stocks you want to actually invest in long term, those are not the stocks discussed on this sub, so stop getting married to fucking meme stocks, but don't marry your long term investments either."

We just traded 2.3 billion dollars on CRSR today? Consolidating above resistance at $36? I am so confident we're going to see $60 per share, which is a somewhat more realistic valuation for this company that just increased guidance to 2 billion in sales for this year...

2021-06-14 19:34:47,wallstreetbets,"People asking about WHY you don't paint the tape on TACO in PM and AH  
  
There are many people who have a very strong opinion about the stock, and trying to manipulate the price AH will trigger the other side.  
  
A bear tried to dump TACO PM 5%+ a couple months back in an attempt to trigger a mass sell off with stop losses. He got ran over instantly.  
  
Why did he try this? Karens hate John because he gives ""hand outs"".  
  
Trying to do the opposite is gonna trigger the karens who want the stock to dump so John may leave.  
  
Yes the volume is low, but remember its deceptively low. Market open and close often shows surges of 30-50K volume, with the rest of the day posting barely 300 shares traded over the course of HOURS.  
  
Sure it looks inviting to the apes and pumper and dumpers who don't know the stock, but the TACO whales are no joke and when they show up its devastating.  
  
Not only this, but the options market is so low volume a single sell order can turn a 0.79 contract into 0.01 instantly.  
  
If you try rushing into far OTM calls and try to ride the wave, you will get hurt."

I can totally see this as next gen online shopping - flash rewards, checkout timers, hell maybe they add badges and achievements next. 

This thing is going to definitely drive revenue, but as a secondary market for goods that didn't move product in mainstream stores.

He put together an hour of the best DD I have ever seen. Yolo’d that conviction w a young family, and waited forever to see it realized. He held and held when no one earth would have held. He exercised his options back into his play. He had the most bad ass BTFD I have ever seen. 

He is affable and a good cat. He is WSB 🐐 and not even close. 

While unintentional, you made it seem like he did something wrong and that simply is not the case."

2021-06-14 16:57:31,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't it depend on the nature of the debt? If it's floating rate then their interest payments go up, but if it is a fixed coupon then increasing rates won't impact them at all. 

I'd look into their 10-Ks myself but I can't read."
2021-06-14 16:16:41,wallstreetbets,"Interest rates doesnt affect existing debt.  The debt that some companies took on during the historically low rates will remain at those rates even as interest rates increase.  Dumbed down example: if i take out a mortgage at a fixed rate of 2.25%, then the next month rates spike to 6%, my payment won’t change.  These companies with NEW debt (UWM for example) took on the debt specifically to take advantage of this fact.  Companies with OLD debt (AMC for example) are still stuck with their old rates and rising rates also have little affect on them.  The rates will affect companies that are NOW looking to take on debt for expansions or whatever."

2021-06-14 16:47:30,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea why everybody is shitting their pants over inflation. There hasn’t been any inflation in decades worth mentioning.

IF there is inflation allowed \[other than what the real one is which they’re not going to tell you because then you’d *really* shit your pants\], it’s going to be a minuscule amount. Like 0.05% or something. Nothing that anyone really is going to change their mind over.

Why will it be low? Because if it was high, that makes the cost of funding the budget deficit unaffordable. They’re not going to do that.

I also hear things like ‘hyper inflation’. Apparently nobody hear ever heard of the Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe, which had actual hyper inflation. And money denominations ‘100 billion dollars’ ’10 Trillion dollars’. If that level of inflation was allowed, the world economy would tank. You would pay for your Starbucks coffee with so many Dollar bills it would fill a wheelbarrow and the wheelbarrow would be worth more than the money it transported.

So quit whining about inflation, there’s not going to be meaningful inflation. Actual inflation, in the 10-15% range, would stop the economy cold, everybody with loans goes bankrupt immediately, the 2nd amendment club would kill each other over a loaf of bread \[you know they would\]. Nobody wants that. It’s not going to happen."

2021-06-14 18:47:37,wallstreetbets,"It’s better to hold debt during periods of high inflation. The asset(s) that the debt purchased will appreciate while the real value of the debt (the purchasing power per dollar) is diminished.

You’re saying that interest rates are likely to rise with inflation, which is true, but this is offset by the diminished “real value” of the liability."

2021-06-14 17:04:23,wallstreetbets,"Just checked the 10-Q. It's 11% and 11.25% fixed rate debt. They don't have floating rate loans. Just some pretty healthy fixed rates. 

Not saying anything about their viability as an investment just that interest rates could skyrocket and it wouldnt impact their interest obligations. The only impact would be that their debt holders would mark down the mark to market value as debt is spread to a treasury, thus price would decline. 

Source: I served a 5 year sentence in corporate debt data/valuation."
2021-06-14 19:18:22,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and this actually means you WANT to have debt with a fixed low interest rate during inflationary periods... if the dollar loses value, you are effectively using inflation to make the real amount of money you owe smaller..."
2021-06-14 16:33:22,wallstreetbets,"While this I do agree with and using UWMC for example, it’ll seem like they have a large sum of debt but in comparison to its structure and liabilities, they’re actually in a good position as well financially.

But there’s something I need to separate or clarify here. You’re assuming the debt is at a fixed rate for x period of time. Not all debt is fixed. A lot of companies will also have variable or floating interest rate debt/loans. These products of debt are impacted heavily regarding an increase in inflation/ increase in interest."
2021-06-14 16:44:26,wallstreetbets,"Correct and there’s also a lot more factors on how and what inflation impacts on a business and economy.

But don’t think because they’re a company or business that they don’t carry or hold variable or floating interest debt products. Whether it be loans, derivatives, securities, etc. Not all debt is at a fixed rate for x amount of time. The debt that is variable or floating interest, will be highly impacted. It also impacts the consumer, but here’s the kicker, one company provides health insurance (Not typically impacted by inflation) and the other is an e-commerce company who retails products at competitive prices which attracts a whole segment of consumers on it’s own. If inflation ever got really bad and us apes go broke, where do you think we get our products from? The place that sells it at a cheaper price, you get were I’m going with this? 😂

It’s a nice setup that people might not be aware of."
2021-06-14 18:39:26,wallstreetbets,"Omg here we go. Citadel owns 0.46% of the float of CLOV. Second, the “conspiracy” you’re trying to push is ridiculous, so what, every stock that Citadel holds is now a stock you can’t hold because of AMC and GME? 

Citadel closed their positions. They’re on the hook for lending out money to Melvin Capital. So, yes they do have more invested interest in shorting AMC then for it continuing to go up. But that’s irrelevant to another stock.

#1. Citadel owns %1.80 of AMC float. Far more then CLOV float which they only own 0.46%.

#2. Citadel Holds 4,110,000 call options and 5,676,200 put options of AMC. Again, they might be more on the short side of AMC, but not by much and that’s their hedge to that specific stock.

The bullshit conspiracies that you’re trying to push are fucking absurd. I’m pro GME and AMC, but that conspiracy bs, needs to stop.

Last note, this is a Casino sir, not GME or AMC only subreddit. Everyone here is here to bet and make money. I don’t care what the stock is as long as it makes me money. End of story."

2021-06-14 18:42:37,wallstreetbets,"With their current cash position and capital structure, all you're saying is that they're (CLOV and WISH) missing an opportunity to issue significant amounts of debt to grow their business at essentially zero percent interest.  That is idiotic and a significant drawback."
2021-06-14 18:52:07,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you are right, this isnt only gme or amc subreddit, but I'm still giving my 2 cents on it.  I would like everyone here to double, triple check every stock that's being pushed here. As I said, there were already multiple stocks that were being pushed here really hard, suspiciously hard. It started with SLVR and we made the connection quickly.Be skeptical. Forum sliding is a thing and hedge funds are using it. Garry Gensler said it was his biggest worry in this WSB situation.  
Also, that's just citadel, and they're in this shit together with other funds.  


One question, ""citadel closed their positions"". What positions? Positions in gme you saying?"
2021-06-14 19:56:28,wallstreetbets,People criticized UWM for taking on half a billion in debt basically for free a month or so ago.  People are dumb.
2021-06-14 18:59:15,wallstreetbets,"Well “reportedly” right, and I was referring to AMC. Although I respect your comment and point of view, it is annoying when you hear every stock be told “oh no the hedge funds are trying to commit a conspiracy” etc. It gets fucking annoying. Not all stocks that have gains or huge traction, or investors interest is related to GME or AMC.

Also, Silver was called out as bs because people were buying the stock version that was controlled by the banks. The banks have the biggest control over gold and silver, and it’s “believed” that they manipulate the value of it. That’s why people were shilling it and people were advising others to buy the psychical Gold or Silver as a hedge to inflation, not the stock version of it.

Again, not related to Shitadel or Melvin etc.

I’m with you in that I support AMC and GME and all that, it’s just some statements are just crazy. It’s like any stock that’s talked about on here that’s not AMC or GME is a hedged controlled plot against AMC or GME and it just gets old."

2021-06-14 16:15:30,wallstreetbets,"BABA.

One of the very few stocks that seem severely undervalued by fundamentals but it's severely undervalued because no one can trust the financials + Chinese govt + China/US relationship + ADR.

&#x200B;

This thing is either going to moon or crash. No in between by 2022 in my mind. At least it's not a 'meme' stock in traditional sense. It's an actual high risk high reward stock (great 'financials' but huge issues with politics).

Hope you the best. I scooped up some BABA shares myself today.

Charlie Munger and Mohnish Pabrai seem to love this company. Both have stupidly good investment track records over the long run.

2021-06-14 19:27:59,wallstreetbets,"I doubt it will crash. For me it is either moon or trade sideways, which for options pretty much means crash lol"
2021-06-14 17:52:32,wallstreetbets,"I wonder how much US relations with China are actually effecting BABA.

I’m not saying it’s had no effect, it has, but I think the main catalyst driving BABA is really just CCP v. BABA.

If you compare JD (a similar Chinese company) with BABA, JD has significantly out performed BABA since the whole ANT IPO/Jack Ma fiasco.

BABA is down 33% since it’s high in late 2020 compared with JD which is only down 11% in that same time frame. JD reached an ATH back in February, and BABA also ran up then, but was still 15% off its ATH before crashing back down."
2021-06-14 19:29:44,wallstreetbets,"US china relations is one thing bc US investors will sell and it will take time for europe and china to pick up the stock.

The main catalyst that has pretty much hit every chinese stock is the tightening of their fiscal policy, which is scary because if what happened to their growth stocks happens to us, it’s time to go into r/dividends or theta gang"

Not exactly a stock that can fully take off because it’s still on OTC, if I’m not mistaken I don’t know if it can trade on US markets until weed is federally legalized."

2021-06-14 16:01:28,wallstreetbets,nah.
2021-06-14 16:13:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's my slightly more serious reason for holding onto it. Unless there's an acquisition, it's going to take awhile to bounce. But when it does bounce, I expect it to be bounce enough to make up for the time I'm leaving my money locked into it. It started as a failed short term play, but I like it as a long term play now."
2021-06-14 15:52:49,wallstreetbets,>~~Proof~~ tiddies or ban
2021-06-14 16:11:51,wallstreetbets,"Added proof of my position (and loss)

2021-06-14 16:28:41,wallstreetbets,"Buy the dip for sure.  By far the most stable meme stocks over the last two weeks.  The volume is amazing.  With volume this high, for this long, at this stable price, the shorts have shorted.  This rocket is ready to launch."
2021-06-14 16:58:36,wallstreetbets,I got that breakout feeling too; bought some more BB today!

2021-06-14 18:51:57,wallstreetbets,"I've said it in other threads, but if you take their non-normal/one-off spending out of it - using their adjusted income/EPS they're at 77 P/E based on 14 sp. I'm not sure on 10x or 1000 sp, but there's definitely room to move on the current price.  Crowdstrike has P/E of 600 for eg.

It does depend on this next report, and September, to demonstrate these one-offs are actually one-offs and not continuing. 

Are you a betting man/woman? We wouldn't be here if we weren't...  🧨🚀🚀🚀🚀🛸🛸🛸"
2021-06-14 18:41:32,wallstreetbets,"Break out news? News don't matter no more old man

BB 🚀🚀🚀 tho"
2021-06-14 17:25:42,wallstreetbets,Wait my 1000$ CAD is not yet deposited. Wait I purchase then we can moon!
2021-06-14 18:45:45,wallstreetbets,Marketwatch is also showing short interest 8.5%. I’m sure a bunch of shorts jumped in at $20. If BB can show some sort of revenue growth at ER I think we can easily test that January high!
2021-06-14 19:48:53,wallstreetbets,Tell that to my June 18 $15 call that's negative $330 right now 😂
2021-06-14 16:47:22,wallstreetbets,"Dear BB,  You are acting like a woman who no longer enjoy sex.  The only moans are from aching. No thrust of the hips and dry as a bone.  Do you require lubrication?  I need to make me rise!!!@"
2021-06-14 19:19:19,wallstreetbets,Zuck has been selling large amounts of FB shares over the past few weeks. Chances that the FB settlement comes out this earnings and he's selling because FB is gonna tank?
2021-06-14 19:21:50,wallstreetbets,Sure hope we get some movement soon expected more with amc running loaded up the entire dip
2021-06-14 19:45:35,wallstreetbets,"i been on the fence awhile, i certainly want them to go up just not sure what else they are doing"
2021-06-14 17:06:02,wallstreetbets,Shill
2021-06-14 18:41:46,wallstreetbets,I don’t think so. It will go below 10 before going up again

2021-06-14 16:16:40,wallstreetbets,"Just hold, we will be past that by year end. I think FB settlement will come by next earnings in September along with sale of IP."
2021-06-14 18:31:50,wallstreetbets,My brother!
2021-06-14 16:49:03,wallstreetbets,I went all in today.... move up!

2021-06-14 15:20:28,wallstreetbets,I have noticed Valvoline taking over all the oil change spots in my area…
2021-06-14 16:28:07,wallstreetbets,"Definitely a good stock for a growth portfolio, but this can definitely have a huge upswing. One of our cars has been sitting over a year since the pandemic and I’m sure there are millions others that have been off the road and this stock will definitely benefit from the world reopening."
2021-06-14 18:06:11,wallstreetbets,What’s the PT?
2021-06-14 16:38:10,wallstreetbets,Time to buy VVV was probably in Feb or before at $25.  Currently VVV is kissing their 52 week high.  Analysts see small upside - $2-$3.
2021-06-14 15:41:11,wallstreetbets,Me too!
2021-06-14 15:42:06,wallstreetbets,They actually built new ones near me.  I think they are expanding but I don’t have proof so I didn’t include it in the post.
2021-06-14 17:03:23,wallstreetbets,That’s my thought as well.  Very few people service their own cars and even fewer want to pay the high price for a dealership to do the service.  Plus lots of people are moving and don’t know who is reliable in their local area… so a national chain like valvoline would be attractive to them.
2021-06-14 17:06:41,wallstreetbets,"I agree earlier would have been better.  But how many times have you seen a good growth stock hit it’s 52 week high and then push further?  I’m not going to draw direct comparisons because every company and situation is different but there are many stocks that if bought during an upswing still had positive returns over the next 12 months.
Personally I think they continue to beat earnings estimates and continue to grow their EV service and product market share while maintaining their traditional customer base.  So I see more upside coming."

2021-06-14 15:36:48,wallstreetbets,"I bought a house less than two years ago and to say Zillows listings were outdated would be an understatement. In fact, out of the half dozen different websites I used, Zillow was by far the worst. Surprising, Redfin was quite accurate and up to date."

2021-06-14 17:53:41,wallstreetbets,"They are more accurate than Zillow, real estate agents HATE zillow.  Median target of $70, high of $104.  Right now its @ $60 +/-.  They acquired RentPath which owned rent.com & apartments.com, & they are the number 1 brokerage site."

2021-06-14 15:17:08,wallstreetbets,"Greetings from Canada, we have a 3rd and final reading in our senate for Bill C-218 tomorrow. This will legalize single event sports betting federally. It should be voted on and passed almost unanimously, and will (very) likely become law by the end of the month. DKNG is already big in the US, so it will likely not see as much of a surge. Smaller companies like $SCR,  $LUCK  and  $FANS should jump significantly following the passage of the bill though.

Take care now

Edit: Oops, almost forgot.... Position is 150 shares avg cost $29.32 CAD in $SCR"

2021-06-14 15:24:45,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-06-14 14:54:43,wallstreetbets,I’m in on both
2021-06-14 14:55:28,wallstreetbets,"Buy weedmaps (SSPK) instead of both of these. Better margins, faster growth, SaaS enabled cannabis play. Ticker changes tomorrow."
2021-06-14 15:30:57,wallstreetbets,"I think you forget the medicinal side of Marijuana. I also think that the microcosm of a state legal but federally illegal product has encouraged smaller growers and distributors. But when you look at a national scale with easy state to state transport, and the ability of a large centralized organization to undercut the price of smaller regional growers. 

Yes, people like their craft beers and similarly like their ""craft weed"" but the cost difference between a craft beer and rolling rock is substantial and many people don't care enough to pay the extra price. It's not that they don't think that the craft beer is substantially ""better"", it's just that paying $12 on average for a 6 pack of craft beer over $7 for a 6 pack of bud is just not something they can afford. I fid it hard to believe that you won't see a similar thing occur with weed. Obviously, there will be regional differences with areas like the PNW being more heavily interested in things like craft beers and such than other regions but I imagine while you may not see a budweiser, you'll probably see a Corona."
2021-06-14 15:03:39,wallstreetbets,"Very interesting to be honest, the industry has lots room for growth to be gained! I’m def looking into that! 
Many thanks"
2021-06-14 15:32:23,wallstreetbets,O.GI is the best choice
2021-06-14 14:56:50,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the insight.
2021-06-14 15:35:07,wallstreetbets,"What about the large multistate operators in the US? Seems like they'd be in the best position to be the ""Budweiser"" since they already have such a strong footprint in the states. Curaleaf, Trulieve, Cresco Labs, Green Thumb"
2021-06-14 18:41:50,wallstreetbets,"I like CRON and it is one of my biggest holdings (4,000 shares). I think what you are seeing with CRON with today's Pharmacann option deal is the company securing distribution channels for their brands. Cannabis is a Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) play and I think you're going to see the same story of big brands winning out as you see in other CPG industries. Mondelez does not worry about buying retail stores, but instead jockeys for the shelf space at the retailers and that allows them to focus on building additional or refining current brands. CRON has Altria as its backer, which is a company that has a very impressive pedigree for brand building. So while I agree quality is very important, that said, being 8/10 in quality with a powerful brand will likely win out over being a 10/10 in quality with no brand. I think you are right, CRON will do well, but branding will play a big role in that success."
2021-06-14 15:00:15,wallstreetbets,Seems more like a sell the news event to me..
2021-06-14 18:26:34,wallstreetbets,"I like WeedMaps too, my 2nd biggest position below CRON. But the two are very different with WeedMaps being an ancillary cannabis play as a cross of tech and cannabis while CRON is a cannabis producer. Great future for both of them!"
2021-06-14 15:57:18,wallstreetbets,"Bro weed hasn't been medical here for 10 years, medical industry died"
2021-06-14 15:07:18,wallstreetbets,"It's going to be very interesting to see how states that haven't legalized yet proceed in making laws when they do legalize. So far, the laws haven't been set up for commercial grows big enough to support more than one state and getting licenses has become a bit of a cluster fuck. Most if them are given onna lottery system"
2021-06-14 15:56:47,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, if anyone was going to do it it would be them. Just based on personal experience the bigger brands don't make the most money"
2021-06-14 16:25:17,wallstreetbets,"I’m talking long term, not a weekly play. If you want a diversified, profitable, growth play in cannabis that literally every fund manager can touch, check out SSPK. It’s decoupled from a majority of the issues still hitting MSOs and growers"

2021-06-14 15:10:26,wallstreetbets,"“$CRSR DD Part 2 or why Corsair will swallow the gaming industry and be a 'millionaire maker' stock

Sup apes. In my first [DD last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxhh7d/crsr_dd_or_why_you_should_park_all_your_cash_in/), I gave a short rundown of why Corsair is incredibly undervalued, and how it should be in **everyone’s portfolio**. With Part 2, I’m addressing a lot of the comments I got as well as going a bit deeper into how Corsair will make this industry their bitch and reach ATH in 2021.  

-


**Why is Corsair in a strong position to leverage the gaming and streaming industry?**
-
Corsair didn’t snooze, but rather spend the last years hunting for good companies to acquire. Being well funded, profitable and raking in cash every year allowed them to expand in all directions with a core focus on the fastest growing niche: Streaming. Have a look at their investor relations page:

-

*“Corsair is a leading global provider and innovator of high-performance gear for gamers and content creators. Our industry-leading gaming gear helps digital athletes, from casual gamers to committed professionals, to perform at their peak across PC or console platforms, and our streaming gear enables creators to produce studio-quality content to share with friends or to broadcast to millions of fans.* 

*CORSAIR also includes subsidiary brands Elgato, which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators, SCUF Gaming, which builds custom-designed controllers for competitive gamers, and **ORIGIN PC**, a builder of custom gaming and workstation desktop PCs and laptops.**

-
With Elgato they positioned themselves years ago already to capitalize on one of the fastest growing entertainment subsegments (Streaming). While acquiring SCUF Gaming and ORIGIN PC allowed them to also expand and play in the console market as well as Pre Build PCs and laptops. **They basically moved up the ladder from RGB fans, keyboards, RAM sticks and Cases to EVERYTHING you need to play, stream or game properly.**

**How much faster is Corsair really expanding?**
-

I cannot stress this enough, but their last quarter results really blew it completely out of the water. Seeing how they raised guidance, I think August will be even more brutal. One for value:

* **$529.4 million** in net revenue, an increase of **71.6%** year-over-year. 
* **$175.9 million** net revenue for Gamer and creator peripherals segment, an increase of **131.9%** year-over-year.
* Gross profit was **$160.3 million**, an increase of **103.9%** year-over-year, with a gross margin of 30.3%, an improvement of 480 basis points year-over-year. 
* Operating income was **$67.3 million**, an increase of **404.5%** year-over-year.
* Adjusted operating income was **$80.4 million**, an increase of **221.4%** year-over-year.


-
Do yourself a favor and whip up a site like FinViz, punch in your favorite meme stock and have a look at their revenue number vs market cap. There’s a reason why GME got picked up by DFV. Sales is still king and undervalued companies with aggressive growth have insane potential short and long term.

-
**Why hasn’t it blown up yet to +100?**
-

There is a good amount of chatter about two things. One being market manipulation, the other is that there is very little retail investor interest, compared to the amount of net sellers. The second point actually holds up, the stock never really got picked up by retail investors (or apes) and a lot of the commenters that did buy it up, mentioned how they were perfectly content with amassing shares every month while the price is still low. Pure but selfish value investing. 

-
**Eagle What?**
-

This one was also pointed out a lot. Corsair is owned by a private equity firm called EagleTree. They purchased the majority stake back in 2017 (which in turn allowed Corsair to expand much more aggressively) and now is obligated to reduce their share position over the next years until they only hold 10% of the company. 

They currently hold 61.9%. The shares sold are mostly picked up by **Vanguard**, **Blackrock** and a few other small institutions, plus retail of course. Looking at insider transactions we can see that EagleTree usually sells shares twice a year with the last transaction happening **June 3rd 2021**. 

This point doesn’t concern me too much personally, as it’s normal for private equity firms to reduce their stake after IPOs and Corsair is barely dipping $2 even with EagleTree selling 5 million shares. Now having sold their shares just now, it will probably be quiet for the next 6 months. 

-
**Back to 2021 and how you can make money**
-

They have a strong customer base which they've built up over the last 20 years, and thought f+ck it, let’s go all in on this market. Tits and streaming? Amazing! Controllers for consoles? Let’s do it. RGB Spinners on your lambo? Fuuckyea.

-

Instead of focusing on boring office peripherals that every Chinese company provides, they instead decided to slap RGB on everything and are loved for it. 

-

**Now EagleTree is gonna continue doing what eagles do, and we will continue doing what apes do. I’ll continue buying this company and watching their ER like a hawk while analysts jack themselves off over the sort of numbers Corsair hits out every quarter.**

-
I said it once, and I’ll say it again. If you don’t hold Corsair shares, you are pretty retarded. But since that’s half the sub already, just do your wife’s boyfriend a favour and pick up some shares while they are still dirt cheap. He will thank you for it once they hit **$70** or even blow through the stratosphere with **+$100.**

-

**TL:DR**

Corsair CEO Smart. Put this in your boomer dad’s portfolio (shares) and If you like gambling, buy some calls. 

-

Position: 100 shares at $33 and 12x 40$ Nov Calls. (yes I’m poor, and you can do better).”"
2021-06-14 15:56:23,wallstreetbets,"It was pumped from Thursday and over the weekend on WSB.  Your guess is as good as mine as to when the dump comes in, but I exited my position at 40"
2021-06-14 15:11:34,wallstreetbets,"Apparently 20ish% shorted which is surprising considering analysts have it pegged to grow to $50 (consensus) by EoY.

2021-06-14 17:24:53,wallstreetbets,"I wish I had a super-secret channel or something but just normal investing and I happened to hit.  


I almost invested in GME before it's hit as well purely from fundamentals (didn't think it was a $4 stock). I'm simply here to watch the noise in case I think I can make a spike profit (AMC). CRSR is just a planned 1yr hold for me unless it gets ridiculously high. I only sold it last time because:  
a) Thought it was at a plateau  
b) Wanted to get on Roblox IPO so had to sell something and my choices were CRSR or PTON that had enough capital to make sense to sell."
2021-06-14 17:37:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’m Corsair. Intel amd etc long term but hearing why it’s spiking I may watch it closely and take some profits , it would just be nice to get on ground level because who ever is getting in first and someone getting everyone on here to follow he’s making millions and the rest are lossing a lot of money"

2021-06-14 15:02:37,wallstreetbets,"See you on the moon /u/pennyether 

I bought a call right before I commented. Should have bought 10. Fuck."
2021-06-14 15:24:09,wallstreetbets,Idk I don't trust the wordsy man. Seems he's trying to prove something.
2021-06-14 15:52:49,wallstreetbets,I would shit myself.
2021-06-14 15:02:49,wallstreetbets,"Damn, could have used that in the DD!"
2021-06-14 18:30:10,wallstreetbets,"THANK YOU! The style I was going for, albeit slightly more reasonable (I think)"
2021-06-14 17:19:39,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, I'm also a shareholder. So keep in mind the conflicting interest (a good rule of thumb for all WSB DDs)"
2021-06-14 19:23:22,wallstreetbets,I made a program that produces it.
2021-06-14 19:42:56,wallstreetbets,Source? I don't think that's true.
2021-06-14 19:48:10,wallstreetbets,"https://www.ortex.com/stock/19595/shorts

Not sure where your numbers are coming from?"
2021-06-14 16:20:23,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-06-14 16:49:40,wallstreetbets,"> On the related subject of interest rates possibly rising: While they do have debt, they have limited exposure. The majority of their long-term debt, $1.45b is fixed-rate vs $906m variable rate."
2021-06-14 18:47:00,wallstreetbets,"It only appears that way, but yes the shares had seemed to have a ""spike"" before the post. BUT if you were paying attention to options, you'd have seen IV looking like a stagnant pond, and suddenly short expiry calls going 10x, and more reasonable calls doubling within 30 minutes of the post."
2021-06-14 16:35:22,wallstreetbets,Penny is legit bro. The legend that figured out how to buy steel futures at the top
2021-06-14 16:29:07,wallstreetbets,he posted it THEN it started spiking.
2021-06-14 16:13:14,wallstreetbets,"Better in what sense? I think BGS has less volatile long term prospects and is a better pick for ""growth to value"", due to the dividend and short interest (which may need to be covered if investors flee to it). And I think the new CEO will provide solid shareholder value in the long run.

WWE has acquisition rumors (but usually does) and could possibly surprise from live events if overall brand engagement gets bumped up. The feedback I've gotten is that people seem a lot more ""iffy"" with WWE... but it could be because they have strong feelings about wrestling lol"
2021-06-14 14:44:06,wallstreetbets,I get it. You’re a fucking idiot 🙌
2021-06-14 15:14:59,wallstreetbets,"Yes just bail before the dump, we taking advantage of algos"
2021-06-14 15:26:34,wallstreetbets,It's on my short list
2021-06-14 15:33:18,wallstreetbets,Then take a small position like me LOL I'm also in WOOF
2021-06-14 15:12:21,wallstreetbets,There is no other explanation
2021-06-14 19:30:00,wallstreetbets,They LITERALLY made me stop eating foods that are shaped like dicks!
2021-06-14 15:15:00,wallstreetbets,No worries. Thanks for checking back
2021-06-14 17:17:12,wallstreetbets,Jesus penny
2021-06-14 17:35:31,wallstreetbets,You should collaborate with u/_demetri_ for your next DD.
2021-06-14 17:51:20,wallstreetbets,Well I'm glad I asked.....I think......

2021-06-14 17:34:11,wallstreetbets,Funnily SPACsabbath my first strategy was spac plays only until the spac life cycle took a backseat
2021-06-14 15:05:29,wallstreetbets,I should have bought ten too :(
2021-06-14 15:55:48,wallstreetbets,Well you’re the one that will have caused it haha
2021-06-14 18:09:00,wallstreetbets,I just bought at a 3% premium in after-hours after reading your DD in hopes of a premarket pump.  I'll pay for your adult diapers.
2021-06-14 19:29:39,wallstreetbets,This was great!  Looking forward to the next.  Feel like I missed out on this one.
2021-06-14 19:14:00,wallstreetbets,"I am also a shareholder of BGS purely because of the deep value, discount after the hacking of the meat plant that affected the stock price (bought the dip), but also the BEEFY dividend. Hoping WSB pumps this baby because this green giant deserves to come all the way to mars 💦♻️"
2021-06-14 19:45:28,wallstreetbets,"Sorry its 25, thought it was 35"
2021-06-14 17:03:45,wallstreetbets,"How is that limited exposure??? Still going to take more than 10 years to pay it back...

Whatever it's a bet people can gamble on whatever they want, but this is not a company with strong financials"
2021-06-14 16:31:05,wallstreetbets,nah SPY recovered is the main reason I would say and 3% ain't no freaking spike in my book!
2021-06-14 15:42:23,wallstreetbets,jesus christ delete this
2021-06-14 17:20:20,wallstreetbets,I'm atheist
2021-06-14 18:20:09,wallstreetbets,"Oh nice I’ll check this out.

And yeah I was doing well with SPACs until the music stopped lol"
2021-06-14 19:30:33,wallstreetbets,If you got enjoyment from reading it in then you've already won
2021-06-14 19:49:50,wallstreetbets,"That sounds about right. It's in the DD:

> Short Interest: Exchange Reported: 25% float (May 28), Ortex: 22% (Jun 8)."
2021-06-14 16:34:56,wallstreetbets,3% isn’t a spike for something that’s 40-60% IV?
2021-06-14 15:46:24,wallstreetbets,Done
2021-06-14 17:33:54,wallstreetbets,🤣

2021-06-14 16:27:04,wallstreetbets,Who would ever want to invest in WISH. It's a scam site dedicated to selling things not as advertised. No one uses wish for purchasing in America lol. Why would you invest in such a company? They're the laughing stock of online purchasing.

They are also winning Supercomputing contracts all the time which is just a little cherry on top. Xilinx will help them increase their TAM and aquire good talent.

Intel has been telling lies regarding their 10nm progress for so many years that I think its crazy how people believe them when they talk about 7nm progress. 10nm really arrived now in 2021, I think thats 5 years late. It they screw up only half as much on 7NM while doubling down on their own fabs they might be doomed. 

They may also manage to turn it around. Anyway TSMC has the money to stay at the very least competitive with Intel amd this takes away Intels competitive advantage it enjoyed for so long a thing of the past. Bidens American Billion subsidies can't help intel. The problem of Intel has never been financial. They had enough money to buy back stock like crazy and they still have a shit-ton of money.

AMD has been underlromising and overdelivering. I would expect this to continue. Even though their Guidance is already ambitious.

Intel is unusually cheap right now due to AMD's (temporary) performance leadership and positive gamer sentiment. But Intel is not only the market leader, it's making bigger plays for the future. They're investing in US fabrication while at the same time partnering with TSMC to stay competitive on process shrink. They're also far ahead of AMD on machine learning and have a public roadmap to quantum computing which AMD lacks afaik.  It can't be ruled out that Intel could eventually get competitive in the GPU space, which would be another big growth area.

If I was building a gaming PC, I'd go AMD over Intel.  But as far as stock investing, I think this is a good time to get INTC at a discount.  It'll be a better long term asset imo."

2021-06-14 13:54:05,wallstreetbets,"Yours (and others) speculation had already been priced in at current levels. AMD is not worth $80/share, but speculation plans that it will be and thus the inflated price.  

They're not ""crushing"" the profits. In the last 4 quarters they made $0.18/share, $0.41, $0.52 & $0.52 again. At $80 a share that's pretty low earnings combined with no dividened. Conversely dispite the gamer/day trader hype, Intel has made $1.23, $1.11, $1.52 & $1.38 per share in the last 4 quarters and they pay a dividend of $0.33 per quarter while their stock price is $57. They've moved to TSMC which resolves their manufacturing issues at .7nm and rehired some of the Tallent that was lost in the past decade, they've also reinstated their policy of having engineer as CEO instead of a bean counter. IMO INTC is undervalued and AMD is overvalued. Not advice, just some facts."
2021-06-14 13:57:14,wallstreetbets,Its biggest problem is that its not THE leader in either market where its a big player. Both intel and nvidia are too entrenched in the business world for AMD to ever become the darling.

2021-06-14 17:49:22,wallstreetbets,">AMD is growing revenues at 50% YoY.  What about Intel

That's fine, for how many years? How many you think they will continue that trend? PC sales are finite, you can't sell more PCs than there is demand, they're growing because of market share they've taken from Intel based on VERY recent performance gains. IF for some reason Intel is the better performer in the next round you can be sure that will flip flop, PC builders have exactly 0 loyalty and will go to the highest performer generally speaking. The current issue is not revenue it's profit margin. Because they're after that market share they're sacrificing pm. It could work out for them in the long run IF they're able to maintain the lead on performance but that is a big IF. Meanwhile on the flip side, even with market share loss Intel is still managing a higher pm. Will the processor market remain the same? Will it flip flop? Hard to say, all I can tell you is that Intel is not sitting still, the the leading factors to why AMD for ahead in the first place SEEM to have been addressed, but processors are not minted over night, it's going to take a year for Intel to put forth it's best foot.

Am I invested in AMD? Yes, but not at $80-$90 a share. I'm getting ready to unload my AMD. Is Intel something I'm buying right now? No, it's still a little uncertain at the moment, im just responding to the AMD post saying it's a good buy right now, imo (not advice) Intel looks like a better buy right now."

In short Intel is expanding its chip production lines to service it's customer needs such as US gov wants chips manufactured in USA, they will also TRY to make 5nm and 3nm lines but they've been failing on that front recently which is why they've contracted TSMC to produce their procs for 2022 and 2023."

In the past 2 years AMD has gone from $16 a share to $90 a share while Intel has remained in the $50-$65 range. AMD has been on a rocket ship because they finally after years have started making better processors than Intel, but their video cards are still not as good as nVidia. The issue is (as aforementioned) they're not making big profits because they're trying to gain market share and trust at the moment. Stock price is all speculation that it works on ""nothing will ever change, straight line from here"" and AMD will remain king, the issue is (as mentioned in previous post) Intel has fixed it's issues with manufacturing, Tallent and CEO that let AMD get ahead. The sleeping giant is on the move. IF Intel retakes the throne for best gaming processor in the next 4 quarters and holds onto it AMD will come crashing down to $16 a share and rightfully so as it never had a chance to reap the benifit of being on top and demanding higher prices. And IF Intel does not make the comeback, it is also well positioned through its business activities to still make good profits. I think Intel stock is a very reasonable price vs AMD being overpriced. My 2c.

Currently I own a little AMD stock. No Intel but considering buying some."
2021-06-14 18:15:39,wallstreetbets,"It's not as simple as live or dead. You prob would have said ""AMD is dead"" in 2003 when the K8 arch was released signaling the end of the athalon era when AMD last held a position of having decent performing processors."

2021-06-14 16:20:30,wallstreetbets,">	AMD gpu are surpassing Nvidia on a performance level and gaining market share on a retail level as well.

No they aren’t. They are getting to a point where they are on par. Driver support is abysmal and it is a known ongoing issue. 

Also look to the enterprise market. Gaming market is a meme. Nvidia has a corner on enterprise solutions as well as deep learning and neural networks."
2021-06-14 15:02:31,wallstreetbets,Just to fill in your knowledge. AMD divested their fab unit in 2008 which went on to become Global Foundries.
2021-06-14 15:02:13,wallstreetbets,"Intel lost 20% server market share this last quarter. Do you think TSMC is going to put Intel first in line before it’s preferred customers when Intel is building its own Fab plants? You are right about competition from ARM though, which makes things bad for Intel all around."
2021-06-14 16:24:26,wallstreetbets,"Since Intel announced that they will become a direct competitor to TSMC by developing a big foundry buisness I wouldn't expect a lot of new cooperarion between the companies.

Especially during the shortage every Wafer given to AMD takes a wafer away from the future competition and you cam bet you ass TSMC is not looking to help Intel catch up."
2021-06-14 17:05:01,wallstreetbets,"Servers sure, but look at the last quarter market share for laptops https://www.cpubenchmark.net/market_share.html"
2021-06-14 18:52:35,wallstreetbets,You say Intel could be better performer in the next round? You think they will suddenly have ample supply of 10nm and breakthrough on 7nm? How about the limited number of ASML machines they have on order? Will they find some of those under a rock? AMD will be on 5 and then 3nm before intc show any sign of progress in those nodes.
2021-06-14 19:52:21,wallstreetbets,"It's going to take a lot lot longer than a year.  They're two process nodes behind.  I expect the next 6-8 quarters from AMD to all be huge blowouts, given my exposure to what industry is buying (data center) based entirely on the performance/power consumption curve."
2021-06-14 18:54:08,wallstreetbets,Those are two really nice paragraphs you got there.
2021-06-14 18:56:25,wallstreetbets,And they were dead. The fact no one bought them is the biggest mystery in economics I have witnessed. A company left for dead with market cap under $2b.... 5 years later they're are buying back $4b
2021-06-14 16:09:09,wallstreetbets,"True ballers bought AMD back in 2018. INTC is far from all time lows right now, but is clearly capable of 20% growth from its current point without breaking a sweat.  Longer term, their capital investments look more compelling than AMD."
2021-06-14 13:53:22,wallstreetbets,I've got another way....
2021-06-14 16:56:08,wallstreetbets,Intel has always been in the fab business
2021-06-14 16:56:58,wallstreetbets,Are you investing in AMD recently on the assumption of a long term shortage? Doesn't seem smart to me.
2021-06-14 18:47:37,wallstreetbets,Look at the trend. AMD will be selling more laptops than Intel soon enough
2021-06-14 17:37:31,wallstreetbets,I bought AMD @ $16/share and again at $32
2021-06-14 14:19:09,wallstreetbets,Amd has been popping off way before amc.
2021-06-14 15:07:32,wallstreetbets,Hope that means ban?
2021-06-14 17:37:43,wallstreetbets,"Not really. They have been keepimg their advanced nodes for them selves and a few select companies that didnt compete. Are there any arm chips built on Intel? Any Nvidia chips? Any AMD chips?

List the companies that used Intel for fabrication of multiple generations of product please.

For TSMC that list is Huuuuge. Because they are a foundry"

I even wrote up my own WSB DD post, but I deleted it in frustration after 2 months of trading sideways. What I didn't show is that I had 250 $35 calls expiring this Friday. I bought them at $2.15ish when the stock popped on their last earnings report and I watched them drop all the way to like $0.15 each and sold them this morning for $3. I guess I could have made a lot more off those, but I was happy to take my 30% gain after watching them almost expire worthless."
2021-06-14 14:27:15,wallstreetbets,"Keep the faith. I started 2020 with $52k, dropped to $32k in March, hit $2.96M in  March of this year (thanks GME and VIAC), then hit $700k by April (thanks again VIAC... and my own stupidity). Anything is possible."

Dude if i ever cross a million im dumping half into safe dividend stonks and continuing my gambling 😂 really want to learn options but i dont know if i have the stones for it 😂

2021-06-14 14:25:18,wallstreetbets,I first got in around that price and averaged down as much as possible. It makes up like 70-80% of my portfolio.

That'll teach the government! But seriously, don't make my mistake."
2021-06-14 17:50:15,wallstreetbets,"Sure I did, then I stuck it right back into something else. It worked great until it didn't."
2021-06-14 16:14:21,wallstreetbets,I was deep deep in $90c VIAC when they announced a stock sale and the stock plummeted more and more. Every day we thought it was just an overreaction and it would bounce right back. It was only a couple weeks later we learned about the Archegos $100B implosion that took us out and it wasn't coming back. I got margin called to death. It sucked.
2021-06-14 15:03:06,wallstreetbets,I prefer to average up. I think my 241 shares will be okay for a while... it makes up a lot of my portfolio (20k).
2021-06-14 16:16:22,wallstreetbets,"dude i had a 3x on clov and set a stop loss at 2x, like why didnt i take the 3x? because im an ape apparently, greed man, happens to the best of us. but again, 700k from 52k aint bad at all!

2021-06-14 15:48:26,wallstreetbets,"Fellow apes, AMC (and GME) is the REAL play, so thanks OP for sharing - any other ticker is a distraction at this point and very welcome by Kenny and friends because they've already made a huge mess in their pants and will keep to doing so until the AMC (and GME) rocket lifts off. No financial advice."
2021-06-14 16:02:00,wallstreetbets,If I buy them at 15.5 I’ll still be up 8 K +
2021-06-14 12:55:35,wallstreetbets,"If I buy these contracts I will be paying roughly 3K
Since the contract is for 15.5$ I am buying 200 shares at that price."
2021-06-14 12:50:07,wallstreetbets,That’s the plan!
2021-06-14 16:25:05,wallstreetbets,"Understood. But if you sell the calls, then buy the shares, you are up $10.7K (at the time of your screenshot).  You’re losing your extrinsic value by holding the calls and then exercising them."
2021-06-14 15:31:44,wallstreetbets,lmao when did you open these that you got contracts for 15.5; back in january? also if youre exercising you better hope the stock goes up to 70+ before it's worth more than what you could sell those calls for right now
2021-06-14 17:00:29,wallstreetbets,I don’t wanna pay 60$ per share. I’ll exercise and sell covered calls.
2021-06-14 16:02:24,wallstreetbets,Bought it 3 weeks ago.
2021-06-14 17:13:50,wallstreetbets,You clearly belong here. Congrats on the win!
2021-06-14 19:07:59,wallstreetbets,LMAO somewhere some hedge fund analyst is reading this and saying “we are losing billions to this??”
2021-06-14 18:50:36,wallstreetbets,I seriously hope you are joking.
2021-06-14 18:55:48,wallstreetbets,About what
2021-06-14 19:57:58,wallstreetbets,"Your calls have intrinsic and extrinsic value. If you exercise the call, you would be giving up the extrinsic time value. If you would like to hold the shares and sell covered calls. You should sell your calls and buy shares with the money. That would give you more shares than if you just exercised them."

That’s r/investing shit though. What a retard would do is find an autist that predicts when the crash will happen then YOLO on puts and short positions. Use the gains from those to buy the dip and fucking retire when the business cycle peaks again.

Contrary to what many people might think, Crypto shouldn't be regarded as a safe hedge against inflation, it is too speculative at this point and during bear markets speculative assets are the last thing you'd want to be in."
2021-06-14 12:47:32,wallstreetbets,Micheal also said GME is the next “big short” scenario. Its gotten to the point where its going to be a good hedge against a crash in my opinion.
2021-06-14 12:46:23,wallstreetbets,Easy invest in AMC

2021-06-14 17:21:30,wallstreetbets,"I have some inverse ETFs (you could also buy puts) (about 80 percent of portfolio), as well as some calls and long positions (maybe 20 percent of portfolio) on stocks in case my bearishness is wrong.

Other than that, learn some homesteading skills. Bushcraft, animal husbandry. Foraging. Farming skills.

Truth is though, if the shit really hits the fan, all of that could even be worthless as a massive crush of people will be seeking to sustain themselves off the wilderness and homesteads that exist.
It could be some really nasty fighting over resources.

I myself use the 90 day and love it and always wished it could last longer and now the 180day is around the corner for the US. I tried Dexcoms and its nice but its not great Dexcoms is doing better because its cheap but not as accurate I would rather take the accuracy and longevity over a cheaper price which I have.

2021-06-14 13:31:31,wallstreetbets,All about market cap and the competition it can occupy a good chunk just keep in mind the partnership they have with Acensia Diabetes Care who will push the product.

2021-06-14 12:52:15,wallstreetbets,I also like how the first slide shows RNG volume growth during the pandemic year.  I'd expect it to pop even more once things get back to normal.

2021-06-14 12:41:30,wallstreetbets,"They mentioned something about how airports took a big hit last year because of covid, but they see that returning back to normal in Q3 this year.  And airport transit is also a big customer of RNG."

2021-06-14 13:26:35,wallstreetbets,Only downside I have seen from $clne is the marketing more people should know about this and they should be shoving the Amazon deal down every persons throat.

Price action on CLNE is extremely predictable, up post and pre market, dip at or shortly after open, slowly rising up through the end of the day. People are treating this like a standard meme stock, trying to scalp/take profit on the way up for crumbs, instead of just holding for a potential 10 bagger. I’ve been in with commons and options since the original DD and I’m not fucking selling until this (cow) shit moons."

I keep seeing this equivalency being made, but RVO's and the small refinery exemptions given under the previous administration have a much greater impact on growth than anything the pandemic might have done.

2021-06-14 19:49:47,wallstreetbets,I think we are the only buyers at the moment. But when big whales or just well off people buy in you will notice. Its being shorted through out the day and loses some of its gains because of it. I would get calls for 7/16 and shares but to be safe I would 100% shares as I got calls too early and it hurts. I'm bad at this so dont listen to me.
2021-06-14 12:42:47,wallstreetbets,YES! that is an INCREDIBLE comeback! We're almost done with Q2 already
2021-06-14 13:01:29,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you have gas stations called “United Dairy Farmers” is the most OHIO thing ever, outside of rusty old buildings."

2021-06-14 18:12:22,wallstreetbets,You sellin?
2021-06-14 14:23:47,wallstreetbets,"Think about it bro I was about to buy an EV this year and realized I can't even go on short 5-6 hours road trips without the ""recharge scaries"". If at this small scale, it's a concern, what do you think it'd be like for large fleets that moves billions of dollars everyday and cannot be stalled? EV is long-term, gas is short-term, and RNG is the middle between the spectrum.

RNG is basically the fucking Avatar that balances world peace. $CLNE LFG 🚀🚀"
2021-06-14 14:29:03,wallstreetbets,"Nothing will beat the sheer power of explosive energy.  Trucks, busses, etc, will not be able to switch to EV, and this is where clne is selling their product."
2021-06-14 14:37:58,wallstreetbets,"Electric is fine if you're moving a small passenger vehicle around a city. It can even be done for longer trips as long as you (the driver and any passengers) are willing to stop for about a half-hour every \~300km or so. 

That's absolutely NOT fine for commercial transport where you want your vehicle to have the most uptime possible. Every minute the truck is sitting around recharging it's not making you money. Every kilo of battery carried is a kilo of cargo not carried. 

I expect that the battery bank on a truck is going to take a fuck of a lot longer to charge, AND it'll take uncomfortably high voltage to do it. The circuits in your house operate at 120V for the most part with ovens and such running on 240V (well, 208 three-phase most likely). The Superchargers near the highway are 480V. There's a limit on what's easy to start moving around and what's safe to let the average joe handle and to get the kind of watts into a battery you either need more current or more volts or both."
2021-06-14 14:06:51,wallstreetbets,The problem with EVs is they can’t go long range without charging that’s why companies like Amazon use them for short range and use RNG for long range transport
2021-06-14 14:07:06,wallstreetbets,Not what CLNE does at all. Read about the company before you tell us how it works.

2021-06-14 15:06:13,wallstreetbets,Come for the ice cream selling gas stations. Stay for the rotting infrastructure. 😎
2021-06-14 16:19:58,wallstreetbets,"Just drove an 9 hour road trip from CT to Ohio and back this weekend. Stopped to charge once on the way there for 35 minutes, and twice on the way back for 30 minutes each (100 miles in because i didnt start at 100%). Had 10 or so charging locations to pick from.

recharge scaries are only a thing until you buy the car.

CLRN has its own applications in commerical & industrial vehicles, airports, etc. Things that can't have the downtime of EVs. But that shouldnt discourage someone from getting an EV now."
2021-06-14 15:19:03,wallstreetbets,"Thats a great point actually, thanks! My worries are coming from a kinda clueless perspective."
2021-06-14 19:30:28,wallstreetbets,You sir are not. Over $30k deep on calls I bought at a big premium. If it doesn’t go above $17.31 I’m going to be paper trading for a good while.

2021-06-14 19:31:04,wallstreetbets,Incorrect. I can confirm comment above is FUD
2021-06-14 18:13:12,wallstreetbets,I think it's actually 7 million shares
2021-06-14 14:53:53,wallstreetbets,That was my first thought too. Looks so similar. But that's not unusual for designs.
2021-06-14 18:32:09,wallstreetbets,My thoughts as well. I love how you got downvoted because these twats couldn't stand anything that could possibly be negative being visible in the main thread.
2021-06-14 17:18:45,wallstreetbets,I got the 18th
2021-06-14 19:51:13,wallstreetbets,"Having had the misfortune of driving up and down 75 many, many times I can honestly say that Ohio is about 90% farms with 3-4 cities worth mentioning. Beautiful place, honestly. I just wish the state would do something for Cincinnati."
2021-06-14 19:36:52,wallstreetbets,At this point ill be lucky just to lose a little on calls. Got shares too tho
2021-06-14 19:29:08,wallstreetbets,I think it's tough to pick an exact number as we have to consider that every additional dollar we go up brings more calls ITM and consequential puts more puts OTM. Any naked shorts expiring on 6/18 or really most shorts expiring 6/18 will likely cover as well. So the range we could see is rather broad and I think most people are looking strictly at the 6/18 $13s because they represent a solid 4 million share block that can serve as a catalyst for the moon trip
2021-06-14 19:35:01,wallstreetbets,"Hell, I was just half joking when I said, tbh, lol. But it looks like an exact rip of that e"
2021-06-14 17:21:22,wallstreetbets,Everyone seems to have the 18th
2021-06-14 18:54:58,wallstreetbets,"I have the same calls, are you looking to wait until friday to sell them or do you want to exercise them? Trying to see if waiting till friday is a good idea considering last day the price drops a lot on contracts."
2021-06-14 17:47:18,wallstreetbets,Maybe the shills somehow got us to buy the 18th. Not too sure how much to trust this subreddit

I suppose it doesn’t really matter, but if you’re trading options with low volume (not that these are) it might matter somewhat more"

2021-06-14 14:27:55,wallstreetbets,"One is psilocybin, the other is lysergic acid diethylamide. 

The active ingredients aren't even the same thing. They're both psychedelics, but even the experience while under their effects is vastly different. 

They're the same thing the way a steak and a piece of lettuce are the same thing; they're not."
2021-06-14 14:45:24,wallstreetbets,They're both psychedelics? Might as well say mescaline and DMT are the exact same thing too.

2021-06-14 14:36:30,wallstreetbets,"There are minor differences between a psilocybin and lsd experience. The only main difference, which I pointed out, is that LSD lasts longer by like 6 hours. There are more similarities than differences. 

It more like a well done steak compared to a medium rare steak."

2021-06-14 14:45:00,wallstreetbets,lol you are so clueless
2021-06-14 14:40:16,wallstreetbets,You should avoid talking about drugs in a public forum. Someone will end up believing you and have a very bad time because they have no clue what they got themselves into.
2021-06-14 18:26:14,wallstreetbets,Uh... no.
2021-06-14 14:42:04,wallstreetbets,"They're really not that similar. If you've done them both once, obviously you're gonna see them both as very similar experiences. Once you've done each of them a number of times, they're very noticeably different experiences."
2021-06-14 14:48:25,wallstreetbets,"Im sure if someone decides to take acid or shrooms it won't be based on what a random redditor said on WSB. I've done both of them frequently, you saying they're completely different is just wrong."
2021-06-14 15:07:18,wallstreetbets,">I've done both of them frequently, you saying they're completely different is just wrong. 

I can assure you I've done both of them more than you. The experiences are rather noticeably different. 

If you gave me a dose of either LSD or Psilocybin and didn't tell me which one it was, I'd be able to tell you which it was within an hour."
2021-06-14 15:10:39,wallstreetbets,Of course you would because psilocybin kicks in after 10 minutes while lsd takes up to an hour to kick in.
2021-06-14 15:23:22,wallstreetbets,"Both of them take a varied amount of time to take effect, influenced by dose, and a myriad of other things.

Everything you're saying seems as if you've had a couple of experiences and just assume that you're now an authority, and anyone that tries the substances will have the same experience as you, and that's laughably asinine."
2021-06-14 15:44:00,wallstreetbets,"Okay they are different, but there a lot of similarities i see. 

Ive taken acid a lot more times than psilocybin. 

Acid for me at least is a lot more easier to control. The emotions are easier to control. It tends to be more of a controlled experience. 

Psilocybin however, it takes me where it wants to take me. Its harder to control emotions at least for me. 

They both bring a change in perception that can help you overcome obstacles. This change in perception is kinda hard to tell apart. They both seem the same to me. 

Ive done acid 12 times and psilocybin twice, so I guess thats not enough."
2021-06-14 15:47:10,wallstreetbets,"I've done acid close to a hundred times, and psilocybin around 50. 

The differences are pretty noticeable."
2021-06-14 18:27:32,wallstreetbets,"With all due respect dude, you sound really young. Nothing wrong with being young, just keep in mind that you don't have it all figured out."
2021-06-14 15:56:43,wallstreetbets,"Okay you win, I concede now im just curious lol

How would describe the difference in experience between them? Like in perception and benefits"
2021-06-14 12:32:09,wallstreetbets,No idea who that is. My money goes to the big tiddy girls squatting in dirty ass water.
2021-06-14 12:58:48,wallstreetbets,"So watching someone trade is a thing now? Either I'm boomer as fuck or this is some 16-20yr old shit. 

I'm ok with either option as long as I don't contribute to the viewership of either of these assclowns."
2021-06-14 12:46:59,wallstreetbets,dumb. he doesnt show any transactions and that is on purpose. you cant show live priced trades. you can get sued for being instructional.
2021-06-14 12:42:34,wallstreetbets,It makes sense to paper trade on screen and keep your own shit to yourself... It doesn't make sense to pocket donations while AMC goes up 900%... Idk about this but ppl should call him out till he explains himself... Imo
2021-06-14 13:51:28,wallstreetbets,"I don't watch Matt or Trey that often but Matt has disclosed his position before and Trey showed where he sold over a million in amc option contracts less than 2 weeks ago. None of this matters because anyone that gives a shit about AMC could care less about what someone says on WSB. We didn't mean anything for months in this group, no need in talking about us now."
2021-06-14 12:34:49,wallstreetbets,🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆
2021-06-14 12:47:49,wallstreetbets,I'm not to sure about that
2021-06-14 12:38:23,wallstreetbets,"he has shown his positions before... you quoted a small portion of a disclaimer... which iam sure was written up by a lawyer... iam not on his jock.. so simmer down, he is too boring for me..i prefer to listen to trey.. but matt does good for his thing."
2021-06-14 12:27:22,wallstreetbets,"maybe hes doing that to protect himself? ever thought about that?

before he boomed big he did trade onscreen....."

2021-06-14 12:46:49,wallstreetbets,Oh damn just read that no shit. I thought he was a con artist but wasn't sure. Bias confirmed.
2021-06-14 14:22:44,wallstreetbets,Watching someone else live trade sounds about as entertaining as watching paint dry.
2021-06-14 12:47:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'd much rather pay 50 bucks to some e-girl to shout my username before she farts in a bathtub than watch someone paper trade WSB's money.  I am perfectly capable of losing money on the stock market myself.
2021-06-14 13:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm boomer as fuck too apparently because I didn't know this was a thing until today. Then again, people watch people eat, so I'm not surprised. This younger gen is a bunch of baby dick weirdos."
2021-06-14 13:18:44,wallstreetbets,Lol why have 900% when pocketing free donation money is literally ∞%
2021-06-14 13:02:48,wallstreetbets,True
2021-06-14 13:10:48,wallstreetbets,"So you watch others trade paper money while staying poor. To each their own, no judgment."
2021-06-14 12:28:34,wallstreetbets,"Take his merch off bro, you look ridiculous."
2021-06-14 12:33:57,wallstreetbets,It’s the same with Meet Kevin . I knew something is up with him . Mf have over 1 mill fans & averaging over 100k views per video. He got a EGO
2021-06-14 12:30:45,wallstreetbets,"I never even heard of this dude until today, saw another guy post but figured I'd call this dude out directly because he even looks like a pussy, but ya you're right, all these guys are deceiving their followers for their own personal gain.

Makes you wonder though, why not actually trade it like a real autist rather than have 0 risk tolerance like a bitch."
2021-06-14 14:30:50,wallstreetbets,I did not know it was possible for females to fart in bathtubs! Do you have any..um..proof of your claim? For science.

2021-06-14 16:33:03,wallstreetbets,I dont really see how this makes sense if he was multiplying donations by 900%...
2021-06-14 14:36:46,wallstreetbets,bro you make no sense.... iam saying he has a stake in amc.. and iam not going broke by any means.. are you a new ape???
2021-06-14 12:34:15,wallstreetbets,dont even superchat/buy merch just look for infos..
2021-06-14 12:45:12,wallstreetbets,I like Meet Kevin
2021-06-14 12:37:16,wallstreetbets,I’d disagree on this one. He definitely doesn’t try to sell the far fetched dumb shot that Trey and Matt are peddling. I see your point but I think he’s a different animal.

2021-06-14 15:17:33,wallstreetbets,"Have fun watching people paper trade. Weird life but I support anything anyone does as long as you're not harming anyone. If you wanna keep sucking Matt off, feel free. Just send me a vid of it at least. DMs open."
2021-06-14 13:26:08,wallstreetbets,I’ve never met Kevin
2021-06-14 13:51:07,wallstreetbets,He’s running for mayor or governor in CA.  All he is selling is himself.  Hard pass.
2021-06-14 12:38:16,wallstreetbets,Hmm 🤔
2021-06-14 16:55:06,wallstreetbets,I guess that would imply he has $0 invested in AMC ?
2021-06-14 15:32:28,wallstreetbets,wow.. did you even read my comment?? lmao... told you he is too boring for me.. why you so butt hurt??? did you pay for a superchat or something and he didnt answer your question???
2021-06-14 15:46:36,wallstreetbets,"but for the record. i cant speak for everybody, but most people watching him and others for info and technical analysis, not to watch them trade."
2021-06-14 17:01:35,wallstreetbets,If he's paper trading then yeah. Zero risk and you pocket donations.
2021-06-14 15:36:14,wallstreetbets,The fuck is a superchat. I might be too old for this conversation.
2021-06-14 16:12:18,wallstreetbets,dude what the fuck is a superchat
2021-06-14 17:08:59,wallstreetbets,Wait so u think this guy makes 7 hour ytv and goes on fox news and has zildge invested !?
2021-06-14 15:41:07,wallstreetbets,"oh boy, its what your bitching about. money that matt takes.. you really need to educated yourself before you sound anymore stupid and calling people out"
2021-06-14 19:06:47,wallstreetbets,"I think you can send a question that gets highlighted or something. I don't watch any streams, at all, but I've seen it referenced on Reddit."
2021-06-14 17:17:11,wallstreetbets,I don't know who he is.
2021-06-14 14:48:36,wallstreetbets,Nice entry point!
2021-06-14 13:20:42,wallstreetbets,I mean if this company was completely dead as the shorts say it would have already plummeted. It’s showing support at 6 and just needs some good news
2021-06-14 12:29:52,wallstreetbets,Ded stonks. Hold the bag homie
2021-06-14 12:28:40,wallstreetbets,"This shit is dead man, at least for now"
2021-06-14 14:22:36,wallstreetbets,I could be wrong but I saw some guy on here with like 600k worth of ocugen. This has probably been a rough week for him
2021-06-14 13:05:39,wallstreetbets,"Now is the time to buy in for superior gains, but totes a risk. I am def a bag holder, but I’m long and I don’t think covid is going away. Plus yearly requirements for shots, crazy variants, us needs to contribute to other nations-probably multiple times, so plenty of money to be made IMO. Maybe not to 100, but I think 20-50 is realistic with Canada market. I mean this is a stock that was above 100 for years before one of their drugs failed. I can see it. Also it’s nice to see india has made getting covaxin approved in the US a national point of pride and are seemingly willing to fund trials if necessary. Think it makes sense to buy some just for the upcoming 20th data pump. Anyways, GME and amc to the moon as well and all love ape gang"
2021-06-14 12:36:58,wallstreetbets,"Such desperate,  many bags."
2021-06-14 12:32:47,wallstreetbets,Billion dollar market cap on zero revenue... No thanks
2021-06-14 12:31:19,wallstreetbets,Dude it's overvalued... By alot
2021-06-14 12:33:10,wallstreetbets,Yikes. Trying to unload those bags eh ?
2021-06-14 12:35:48,wallstreetbets,This DD is weeks old.  It crashed when they announced they would pursue regular authorization instead of emergency.  I am definitely a bag holder.
2021-06-14 13:21:09,wallstreetbets,"Hello, I'm here for bagholders meeting?

2021-06-14 13:00:24,wallstreetbets,The ceo pumped and dumped us twice. Ocugen is dead (held 3k shares for six months and sold last week...). Had so much potential but not with shanky as the ceo.
2021-06-14 19:27:12,wallstreetbets,"Love all the people on here talking shit that have clearly not done much DD on OCGN, BB, and Covaxin."

2021-06-14 16:29:10,wallstreetbets,It has to fill that gap at 5.25 tho 🤷‍♂️ wish is better
2021-06-14 12:34:44,wallstreetbets,And it has zero chance of approval in the US.  The US has more vaccine being produced than we are administering and don't need another one.
2021-06-14 12:39:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah unless the bags you’re holding are from 2020, you should hop off this vicious money shredder.

Their partnered vaccine candidate is gonna give them a bump but it’s the partnership that will kill the massive profit potential, not to mention they aren’t near approval yet, and NVAX is gonna cross the finish line first with comparable numbers. 

The drugs they actually develop are generally dead fish, which sucks, because they’re trying to help people with very debilitating, unaddressed eye diseases."

2021-06-14 12:24:53,wallstreetbets,"I just listened in on the annual stockholder's meeting, which just now concluded. The company is poised to make great gains and expand at a pretty rapid pace, especially with the Amazon partnership happening later this year. Amazon will own a 20% stock in the company, but only as they buy more fuel. Currently, they're servicing LA transit, NYC transit, Waste Management, and Republic (waste company). Their numbers look solid and once airports open up, their gallons sold per year will double.

I'll also note that the strike price for Amazon is over $13.

Edit: Full disclosure, I hold 143 shares at 11.80."

2021-06-14 12:41:56,wallstreetbets,Seriously this is a solid play in the short term with a huge upside but also a really solid play long term. Buy a shit ton of shares now and when it moons this Friday you'll rake it in. Even if it doesn't this company is so well positioned it will pay like crazy down the road.

2021-06-14 13:46:18,wallstreetbets,"As other commenters have noted, there is 41000 OI on $13 calls for this Friday. When you.lookat all calls $20 and under your closer to double that. So if we are at $13 or higher on Friday, whoever sold those calls originally will have to make sure they have enough shares to cover as those options have a very high change of being exercised since they will be ITM. This will drive the price up and bring other strike calls such as $15 and $20 and that will also help drive the price. People are hoping that the combination of these forces, as well as the stocks general status as undervalued, will push the price well into the $20s."
2021-06-14 13:28:10,wallstreetbets,The options chain shows a significant amount of 06/18 options would go ITM if CLNE can close over $13. Some are referring to this as MOAGS or Mother of all Gamma Squeezies.
2021-06-14 13:07:37,wallstreetbets,Shares usually drop in price on Fridays
2021-06-14 17:01:51,wallstreetbets,Expirations
2021-06-14 12:34:27,wallstreetbets,"And it is pending a $500,000,000 investment from Amazon"
2021-06-14 12:35:53,wallstreetbets,"No problem- great post. A few more deets about the Amazon fuel agreement:

Amazon receives warrants for 53.14 million shares of CLNE common stock at an exercise price of $13.49/share. Those warrants become available to Amazon at set intervals as Amazon moves towards its commitment in the agreement to purchase $500M in fuel from CLNE.

13.28 million of the warrant shares are immediately available to Amazon.  Amazon will have incentive to exercise these warrants the higher the share price rises over $13.49.

These warrants will essentially act as a dilution when exercised by Amazon.  However, CLNE stands to gain the $500M in revenue plus $716.86M from the warrant shares over the life of this agreement.  Amazon has until 04/16/31 to exercise the warrants.  Once/if fully executed, Amazon would own 19.99% of CLNE common shares."
2021-06-14 15:35:43,wallstreetbets,You’re whalecum
2021-06-14 18:25:15,wallstreetbets,"If I have calls for 6/18, they don't need to be exercised til market close, correct? New to options but if it squeezes I'm hoping to get in on it a little"
2021-06-14 15:19:02,wallstreetbets,"The key though is getting it to $13. Hopefully we see enough interest soon to make it happen.

I also wonder if a last minute run to $13 would make the squeeze more intense. I’m not very well versed in options so idk."
2021-06-14 14:47:25,wallstreetbets,"Usually,  but this is not a Usually play."
2021-06-14 12:39:09,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the additional info! Great information here.
2021-06-14 12:54:54,wallstreetbets,"So you’re saying in the meantime the ceiling is 13.49 because it acts as a resistance. Meanwhile when Amazon exercises their options they dilute the float. So either they trade in a range until 2031 or they get a share dilution. 

Sounds like a sound investment for theta gang, thanks"
2021-06-14 12:15:06,wallstreetbets,I’m investing in the same thing just way less shares!WISH/CLOV to the moon baby!🚀🌙

2021-06-14 12:21:03,wallstreetbets,"Since you didn't violate any law, nor their TOS, I suggest to pursue legal action. The shares you purchased are legally property of your family members, who authorized you to act on their behalf.

If you are unsure whether you have a case, post this in the legal advice sub. The lawyers there will be happy to help.

From my perspective, settling for your initial transfer is way, way too timid.


By the way: genius system. You have a bright future in finance."
2021-06-14 12:30:02,wallstreetbets,I’m not so sure about this story. I was holding $USO during a reverse split in multiple accounts and they cashed out the shares that would have resulted in fractional shares. Never got the full share the OP is claiming to be getting.
2021-06-14 12:21:55,wallstreetbets,So it’s an office space rounding error?
2021-06-14 12:54:44,wallstreetbets,Lol at anyone who thinks this is real.
2021-06-14 12:26:34,wallstreetbets,AFAIK you’re actually not allowed to run investment accounts for other people I think this is fucking hilarious though

2021-06-14 17:55:44,wallstreetbets,Wow this is dumb. No brokerage is going to “round” up and give shares like that. Also nothing bad ever happens to giving some stranger in India access to your accounts. 🤦‍♂️
2021-06-14 12:31:40,wallstreetbets,"Kid, you can take my money. Seriously, pursue legal action, if you’re cute and/or not-white, make an IG documenting how you’re struggling to make a better life for your family as a minor, how you’re a true Robinhood (not a BSing liar like Vlad) working against the system, and how big business vanguard shut you down because they’re trying to keep anyone from  actually rising above the income demographic they were born into. You’re obviously smart enough to do it, just find someone who can take good pictures and turn your story into a David vs. Goliath via social media. You’ll make so much money off the fees vanguard is going to have to pay out, and maybe get your own Netflix movie or something if you can spin it right. I’m totally serious, btw—I can visualize the whole media circus."
2021-06-14 12:24:34,wallstreetbets,He needs to be tested

2021-06-14 17:19:35,wallstreetbets,OP would be prosecuted if older. Imagine if everyone did this. That’s why nobody can and shouldn’t do this.
2021-06-14 18:13:42,wallstreetbets,"With reverse splits, I thought it was up to the company doing the split whether to cash out your fractional shares or round up your fractional share to a full share."

2021-06-14 13:08:00,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Usually it's a debit, not a rounded up share. Otherwise if this happened to thousands of people, that's a lot of synthetic shares created each time. I don't use Vanguard though."
2021-06-14 14:54:47,wallstreetbets,"Two questions.  One: does Vanguard do fractional?  Two: did your brokerage?

If you run this scam on a platform that doesn't do fractional, then they probably would pay out by rounding up."

I spent a lot of time finding this information and I do think $WOOF is a good value play that is being HEAVILY shorted.  Also I'm not the other guy who posted about $WOOF earlier.**

**From the degenerate behind** [**$TX - Latin America's Balls of Steel**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx74mo/tx_dd_ternium_it_up_latin_americas_balls_of_steel/)**, I introduce to you The $WOOF of Wallstreet - A Doggystyle DD.**

# What is WOOF (PetCo)?

[This is their building, its nice I guess.](https://preview.redd.it/wozz1n4269571.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=b88457d937c3f0e0f705601b3299ca1216c001eb)

So now that half of America got all sad and pouty during COVID and bought themselves pandemic pets to cure that hole that permanently exists, pet goods are becoming more and more profitable. On top of this, most of you tards probably don’t realize that just like people who have yearly physicals, your pets need to go to the vet. This is where the new Petco comes in.

Petco defines itself as a “health and wellness company focused on improving the lives of pets, pet parents, and Petco partners”. They sell various products including pet food, toys, health products, and live animals. Most importantly, they have started rapid expansion into veterinary services through their **Thrive & Vital Care** brand**s**. I will bring this up later in the DD and highlight why it is extremely important as a case against popular competitor Chewy.

Petco is also one of the only stores that actually takes a “Think Adoption First” philosophy. They have never sold dogs or cats and ended the sale of birds several years back. This adoption approach helps promote a more ethical way of bringing companions into people’s lives.

# Vets, Expansions, & More:

Alright, so you’re probably wondering, why the fuck would I want to go into Petco when Chewy is already booming and has a unhealthy cult like following. Several reasons, all of which will make your wife's boyfriend let you watch them go doggystyle.

Pandemic pet business exploded, reaching a peak high near the end of 2020 in terms of ownership. ‘Muricans were buying dogs, cats, hamsters, sex dolls, pocket pussies, and basically anything that could temporarily cure loneliness. In 2020, the pet industry posted a record $103.6 billion in sales, per the American Pet Products Association. However, this boom is not going aways anytime soon. Your pet isn’t just going to disappear once you’re back in the office, and no way in hell is Petco taking back that dog you just dressed up for fAmIlY pHoTos.

[Recent discounts and shipment options](https://preview.redd.it/yngwxqxq69571.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c73b477d92c6d7e8f5c4e0dfde8fc00c111732)

This means Petco is about to make **BANK** over the next two to three years solely on food and care supplies. By having physical stores, Petco is able to fulfill **83%** of its online orders through both store-shipment and curbside pickup. This has allowed for same day delivery as well, with many customers reporting deliveries within 3-4 hours.

Many pet owners also prefer getting fresh food, which is much more expensive for Chewy to ship from distribution centers. Petco gets to avoid extra packaging and costs by shipping directly from local stores that keep products en bulk.

Their CEO, Ron Coughlin, states “Giving a personal example, when my order of Just Food for Dogs, fish and sweet potatoes comes from one of our Pet Care Centers two miles from my house, it comes in a simple bag versus a pack box with cardboard with dry ice with foam packaging that online pure-play competitors use for comparable products,” said Mr. Coughlin. “Clearly, we have an advantage here.”

On top of training and grooming services in stores, Petco is overwhelmed by the demand for these services as their CEO reports 11 million new pet adoptions in the past year. In general, pets are considered a **recession-proof** industry since they need to be fed and kept healthy regardless of economic conditions (to some extent).

[ \\""Hahaha we're about to take away your balls dude\\"" \~ Petco Vet Center ](https://preview.redd.it/r7dqe27379571.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701682e5849ee599ad3466a001e1c4c1fac4d89)

**Vet Business:** The Petco brand Vital Care is their main veterinary business and added nearly **70,000** new members since its launch in October, with each of these customers spending **2.5x more than the average customer.** Overall, these services grew **63% year over year** with another 40% increase over the next year. All of these signs point towards a strengthening business model that competes in a space, other companies like PetSmart and Chewy have not expanded into.

**Petco’s Vital Care** offers an annual plan that includes vet services and grooming discounts, for $19/m. This comes out to about $228 a year. On average, appointments, pet insurance, and other emergencies raise traditional vet costs into the thousands. Petco’s plans show that even as a poor, you can continue to live with your 12 cats without going broke. **They also just opened their 100th in-store veterinary hospital with no signs of stopping expansion.**

There have also been reports of some PetCo stores being **renovated** due the the company’s rebranding as a pet health and wellness store. **The reason I find this very bullish is that only a company expecting future growth and having the funds to do so would invest in large renovation projects.**

**Essentially, Petco has transformed itself to become a one stop shop for pet supplies, grooming, training, and vet health services, all while providing a digital platform to access these services. This business model beats nearly every other pet company out there right now.**

This serves **extremely well for both short and long term investors** looking for a possible run-up in the next few weeks and those seeking to capture large gains across several months.

# The S.H.A.R.T Play:

[Self Explanatory](https://preview.redd.it/cvjizmj679571.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=76a63b0e33b4bf8ea6f659cba15ce15e0455cc86)

**This is what S.H.A.R.T stands for:**

S - Short Interest

H - Hype

A - Availability (Demand)

R - Really Memeable

T - Timing

# Shart Interest:

[SHART INTEREST @ 36&#37; 6th Most Shorted Stock](https://preview.redd.it/se8qmn2u69571.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41b575fb9e21966c8655e4688e2e57d6478bda53)

Several different sources are reporting different shart interest numbers on $WOOF, ranging from 9% to 100%. Ideally, I want to go with the 100% shart rate, but I think it is around 36% since this is a fucking Bloomberg Terminal lol. The float is low as well at around 16M.

**Therefore, shart interest is around 36% which is still significantly high.**

&#x200B;

**Hype:**

We can see that $WOOF already gained traction once before and continues to do so. There are some reddit whales who have already bought into $WOOF this past week as well. IV is moderately high across the options chain, hovering between 60-80%, indicating that right now is still an okay time to buy in if this DD is convincing you of Petco's potential.

&#x200B;

**Availability:**

When I say availability, it is meant to measure the demand of the goods and services provided by said company. In the case of Petco, I see demand sustaining throughout 2021 and into 2022, because as mentioned before, pets aren’t going anywhere. If Petco is able to capitalize on this by continuing to bring better service features and different vet plans, it could target niche pet markets such as salon care as well for more wealthy clients. Currently, demand is severely outpacing the availability of their services, and as a result, I believe they will have very strong earnings again.

&#x200B;

**Really Memeable:**

I think this one is self explanatory. Petco memed itself because

a) It IPOd right when GME gaped up everyone’s mom’s buttholes

b) Its ticker is a fucking sound. It’s not even a real word lol.

With WSB already having some knowledge of this ticker and the fundamentals indicating it is a good value play for the year, I have full confidence in this trade regardless of it being memed or not even more.

&#x200B;

**Timing:**

Somewhat covered in the previous points, but this is the perfect entry point. Looking at the price graph over the past 6 months, even after beating the estimated Q1 EPS of $0.09 by nearly 100% (Actual EPS of $0.17), the stock has continued to trade sideways for a majority of the year. You could have bought in February and made $0 to date. For this reason, I think the timing for the play is great. 

# Financials:

As mentioned earlier the predicted EPS for Q1 of 2021 was $0.09 while the actual EPS ended up being $0.17, a **89% beat**. Meanwhile, the stock tanked lower and has stayed bound between the $20 and $24 range for 5 months.

Within this quarter alone, Petco got an additional **1.2 million customers and 28% increase in YoY sales.** Through DoorDash, they are able to increase expected revenue up to **$5.58B** by continuously providing same day shipping. (I find this partnership a bit sketchy just because of how overvalued and trash DoorDash is).

Regarding its competitor $CHEWY, we can see that it leads with a forward P/E of nearly 245 while Petco is “only” at 29. Although this is relatively high, within its sector, Petco is trading at a massive discount. Petco is able to target those who want an in-store experience or simply cheaper services, but also caters to the online crowd in an easy to manage fashion. The same cannot be said for Chewy. Chewy did expand into telehealth services but so far, these do not replace a traditional vet appointment.

In terms of debt, $WOOF just payed off nearly **$1.7B of debt, and is left with just $1.8B**, all due to the IPO funds they secured. With a much more positive balance sheet, I find this to be another reason that right now is a the right time to enter Petco.

# Given all of this data, future growth, and the expansion of Petco as much more than a pet supply store, it makes zero sense for this stock to have a 36% short interest rate or trade sideways for so long.

&#x200B;

# Analyst ANALysis:

As of last week, Citi brought back a **Buy rating** on $WOOF with a price target of $31, indicating **upside of nearly 30%** from its current price point of $23.80. Bank of America jumped on this as well (lol), and is giving it a new Buy rating with **increased EBITDA forecasts through 2023.**

On Nasdaq’s overview, based on 3 analysts, **$WOOF is a strong buy with a PT of $29.40. Although ANALysts can be quite wrong, the signs of it being a strong buy are evident across many firms, making this seem like an even better play.**

# ️‍🌈🐻 Case:

I think the main issues Petco faces is its customer service issues. From accounts I’ve read on grooming and vet experiences, people either have an extremely good appointment or a very bad one. Petco needs to fix this by bringing consistency in training across their stores before expanding too much and getting overwhelmed by growth without accounting for quality.

I also think that with the lockup period expiring around Mid-July (180 days after Jan 14th), there could be a small dip if the price runs up in the next few weeks.

One final thing I thought of is if Chewy manages to utilize a healthcare company’s coaching and vet networks to tie into its telehealth services. This is the biggest competitive move they could make as they would only be paying for a network plan as a single client and simply offset the costs across all of their customers. Additionally, many of the networks provided by big names like United Healthcare are multinational and include thousands of providers. This would allow Chewy to give cheaper vet access to all of its customers in almost any location, unlike Petco which is still in the expansion process in its limited stores.

# Conclusion / TL;DR:

Despite the 🌈🐻 case above, **I strongly believe that $WOOF is a very undervalued company with strong financials that get better each day. Combining the 36% shart interest, lower share value, and high PTs, I am convinced that $WOOF is a great play. If you want your wife to let you do it doggystyle, then $WOOF is the perfect play to make money and get turnt.**

**I am in already for 5 contracts of 9/17 30Cs and will continue to add to my position this week. I may also play FDs in case this gains traction this week.**

Please make trades responsibly and with your own understanding of the stock as I’m not responsible for you being retarded or complaining that this is P&D!"

2021-06-14 12:53:34,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate the DD. I've been looking into WOOF as well as a heavily shorted re-opening play. You make a lot of great points, eg. lot's of retarded parents bought their kids pets last year hoping to spend less time talking to their retarded offspring. Hope that worked out for them. No refunds! On either.

I did some gumshoe dd last week and can confirm that the PetCo near me is undergoing a renovation FWIW. About 1/3 of the store footprint is walled off for the reno. Thought I'd buy some cat food while there and the three person line was not moving because the cashier was taking her sweet ass time collecting phone number info from a slow ass customer (is this 2017?). I ended up ditching my shit because I'm impatient as fuck and instead opting to feed my cat the kids beta fish that night. They do need to work on their customer service as you said. News of self-checkout terminals would be a bullish sign that they actually give a fuck about their customers.

Linkedin shows about 8,500 job openings in the US indicating that they are working on customer service and/or are growing. I have no reference value for that number so take it with a lick of salt.

Q for you: Where did you get float of 16M? Marketwatch shows public float at 77M of 226M shares outstanding.

Edit, short ratio is 7.8. That's something.

Edit: aaaand there it went."

2021-06-14 18:25:08,wallstreetbets,"Awesome!!  Thank you for your insight and for saving my sanity!  I bought WOOF earlier this year at its IPO. I watched it tank since for no apparent reason.   Even when positive earnings came out..WOOF stayed down..flat lining.  

  I never thought the hedge funders would short a company like WOOF.   But after reading your article,  it all makes sense. I hope we teach them yet another lesson."
2021-06-14 18:49:03,wallstreetbets,This is a great company. Solid investment opportunity.

2021-06-14 18:48:12,wallstreetbets,Omg i had 350k in optionz loaded for friday and sold on open when it fell. Would have been up a cool mil. Also i coined the term the Woof of Wall Street in a previous post. Feels bad now to have actually missed the juicy run
2021-06-14 16:22:16,wallstreetbets,If we could focus on one pump at a time that would be great.
2021-06-14 15:48:24,wallstreetbets,WSB is all pump & dumps.  You retards just never tell me what you're gonna pump before the pump.  I always miss it.  Thanks alot.
2021-06-14 16:53:09,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I pulled chute on this one today. Glad to get out."
2021-06-14 13:24:42,wallstreetbets,"So 33,000 calls otm at 25-30 dollars expiring this friday with no other major options chains appearing for the remainder of this year is just a coincidence? 😛"
2021-06-14 17:34:38,wallstreetbets,"This isn't it. For me at least

WOOF has traded sideways/down since IPO. 

While this is good DD, I find a hard time believing the stock will take off. Ever shopped at petco? There's hardly anyone in there. Most people don't use pet store vets either. And while they are breaking into the online pet business, I don't see them doing well because Chewy just dominates online pet supplies

I could be wrong tho"
2021-06-14 12:04:19,wallstreetbets,Fuck off bot
2021-06-14 17:01:53,wallstreetbets,Can you pump my BFLY DD plz thx 💚
2021-06-14 17:44:10,wallstreetbets,"I think you meant $WUPHF

&#x200B;

DD

When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. 

Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It’s actually a great idea and I can’t believe it didn’t exist before. And I know Ryan’s kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I’ve done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ryan: WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you’re at spring break, Daytona Beach.  
Michael: Here we go.  
Ryan: Everyone’s like, “Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?” Or, Uh, “Hey, what’s up with that helicopter? It’s Ry from WUPHF!”  
Michael: “It’s Ryan the WUPHF guy!”  
Ryan: “Yo, Ry from WUPHF!”  
Michael: “He’s up there.”  
Ryan: “What’s he dropping?! Wow, what’s falling on us, man?!” WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!  
Michael: Look at that! He threw ’em on the ground!  
Daryl: Look, this is a marketing campgain. You got nine days. Let’s say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it?  
Ryan: The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don’t think about the money. Ever.  
Andy: That sounds weird.  
Michael: No, it’s not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that."
2021-06-14 18:59:02,wallstreetbets,what in the world of pumpndumps
2021-06-14 14:10:15,wallstreetbets,$PETS is better play. 30% short and a divy. Plus low P/E
2021-06-14 14:04:57,wallstreetbets,"Good DD, but get outta here with 36% short interest. #6 most shorted doesn't mean squat if the market as a whole isn't that short. GME and VW both hit over 100% of float for the squeeze to happen, 36% ain't going nowhere."
2021-06-14 12:01:36,wallstreetbets,I’m buying $PBTS $GME $AMC

But I guess you're technically correct, the best kind of correct."

My last DD for the day, also.  I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really like Nio."

500 x $2000 =  $1 mil"

2021-06-14 12:15:38,wallstreetbets,what the literal fuck has this sub turned into?
2021-06-14 12:15:59,wallstreetbets,"I love me some Nio. I’m as smooth brained as an ape can be but from what I can tell this company is legit. They are headquartered in the biggest market in the world for electric cars, their cars look sharp, the battery swap that the OP mentioned is a game changer and the stuff I have read says that they make quality vehicles. They are also about to introduce a line of more budget friendly electric cars for those (like me) who can’t afford a Tesla. Nio is my long play and I’m adding a few shares of it every chance I get."

2021-06-14 15:09:33,wallstreetbets,"f nio and the Winnie the poh markets.

The whole ""replace your battery"" when you recharge idea is bad as f. That would imply that each ""gas station"" would have multiple batteries available on standby, which is the major bottleneck of the whole concept. Lithium is a finite resource.

Until there are some revolutionaries on the way we store energy, aka batteries, the whole replace my battery starter pack is just shaite. 

Pump and Dump DD stock."

When I was originally writing, I accidentally put the CNY in, but changed it to USD."
2021-06-14 12:18:37,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like someone is wanting to short, so go short it if you're so confident. There are actual cars produced, actual deliveries, actual people driving them, all you have to do is simply go to Youtube and see for yourself. The expansion to the UK will likely happen in the next 1-3 years, nothing but upside.    


I don't work for Nio whatsoever, so it's not marketing.  I just believe that it is a great opportunity for a very nice ROI."
2021-06-14 12:43:33,wallstreetbets,"lol, I can definitely understand that! I just feel like everyone should have the same opportunity to reap financial success as you and I!"
2021-06-14 12:20:57,wallstreetbets,You added no substance to the sub. You posted some screen grabs of i imagine their website.
2021-06-14 12:37:06,wallstreetbets,"Like I said, I’m smooth brained and didn’t know Tesla had tried the battery swap before so I haven’t read in to why they scrapped it. After a quick Google search I found a website that states that cumbersome swap stations, the high price of the swap station and lack of customer instrest is why Tesla abandoned the swap idea. Nio introduced an option of “Batteries as a service.” This is where consumers can save about $10k on the sticker price of a vehicle if they pay $142 per month to lease a battery that they can swap up to 6 times in that month at their stations. The swaps take 3-5 minutes  and this just seems like the simplest solution to batteries being less efficient after repeated charges. Of course charging is the main route of “refueling” but these stations are a solution if you are almost out of battery and don’t have time for a re-charge. The reasons I’m so bullish on Nio is the huge market that they are in, the high praise for their product and the direction that the world is moving in relation to fossil fuels. The battery swap is just a bonus. FYI, just to reiterate, I am smooth brained and far from an expert on any of this stuff."
2021-06-14 12:25:04,wallstreetbets,"What the battery swap would entail for me as an investor, is the quality of the product you purchase will retain the quality of initial purchase.  Much like the engine in any combustion vehicle will deteriorate over time, the battery in an EV will as well.  Instead of simply charging and draining the battery which over time reduces the maximum charge for the vehicle, thus reducing the range of the vehicle, the battery swap allows the vehicle to retain full range with a full battery.  Better product care overall IMO, something Tesla and other EVs need to truly reconsider.    


Like i compared to the Iphone.  Isn't it so annoying, a year after you bought your Iphone the charge on it sucks, right? Well, that's because overtime the battery maximum charge reduces with the amount of full charges you provide to it."
2021-06-14 12:22:11,wallstreetbets,"if that's how you feel, then simply downvote and leave"
2021-06-14 19:24:03,wallstreetbets,WTF!!! He added a shit ton of substance. Didn’t you see all those fuckin reallys?
2021-06-14 12:54:48,wallstreetbets,"Another good point, definitely not going to replace charging but a good alternative in a pinch. And yes that is why Tesla did not go for battery swaps. Nio will definitely perform well in China and is moving elsewhere, this is where they’ll either make it or break it. If they can gain market share outside of China they will become one of the few EV companies to make it out. Time will tell, happy trading!"
2021-06-14 12:53:08,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree with everything you just mentioned lol, good to be in the same boat as some good company"
2021-06-14 12:50:21,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree, to me it seems like a risk Nio is taking but passing the benefits to the consumer. For the consumer this is great, but will it be sustainable for Nio ? What will they do with all these spare batteries, they need to store them, once the technology is surpassed which happens around every 2 years the battery’s are of no use and need to be recycled. Battery swap stations cost much more than charging stations to supply and take up more space which in itself hurts the consumer ( longer wait times, less options for locations ). The battery pack is also not a structural part of the vehicle which is one of the huge advantages to EVs. Plus as tech continues to advance range loss over time will only get smaller and smaller."
2021-06-14 15:46:38,wallstreetbets,It's hard to see the DD above the screen shot pics of  cars. My dark background renders it almost unreadable.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UK Traders - Which platform do you recommend?  I had no experience in trading, but this GME situation made me take a crash course, buy GME, sell to get my money out and hold with house money. (Used **Hargreaves Lansdown**, high fees but they were the only one I could trade GME without a problem)

Now that I bit the apple, I started reading more about trading and want to do more.

I am trying to find a decent platform to use where I can trade options too.

I tried **IG**'s demo account but they seem to be having an issue with GME.

Which platform do you guys use/recommend?"

2021-06-14 12:17:46,wallstreetbets,"I know you said you have tried IG, but I would honestly go with them. Perhaps contact why they're having issues with GME. They're the #1 broker in the UK. They recently acquired tasty trade - arguably the #1 options provider and highly loved by OG guys in this sub. The likes of T212 have ridiculous spreads and are more targeting  your uninformed traders IMO. The UI, and trading account types are limited and proof is in the pudding with the lack of capital requirements. A huge pro of IG is they offer ""spread betting"" which is essential tax free, low margin required trading. If you know what you are doing, spread betting can provide phenomenal gains with a small amount of capital."

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why WELL Health Beats Clover and Teladoc Okay I have been seeing a bunch of write ups and discussions on these 3 names mentioned as people's favourite healthcare stocks but I think it’s time we finally settle the debate.

[https://stocknews.com/news/tdoc-wlyyf-teladoc-vs-well-health-which-telehealth-stock-is-a-better/](https://stocknews.com/news/tdoc-wlyyf-teladoc-vs-well-health-which-telehealth-stock-is-a-better/)

&#x200B;

* CLOV had a great run and is a great promotion but I’m going to take this off the list because of Citadel's interest. They are long the stock and it feels like they are just trying to trap us at this point. Not to mention it’s trading at a nearly $7bn USD market cap… For what?
* TDOC just feels too big at this point. A $25bn market cap and it really only focuses on Telehealth.
* WELL Health really interests me because it’s a relatively unknown Canadian company (No Institutions all over it) with near half a billion dollars in revenue and positive EBITDA already. Not to mention 20.5% Short interest. It’s founded by a proven entrepreneur who sold his last company to PayPal for $304M and it’s backed by him and the 29th richest man in the world who just invested another $105M at $9.80 (Currently $7.90). They also just completed 2 huge US acquisitions with no dilution everything was priced at that $9.80 level and they had nearly $500M in lines of credit by JP Morgan and RBC which they have used half of. Now they have a NASDAQ IPO lined up for Q4 of this year with Fenwick & West which just completed the COIN IPO. Feels like only a matter of time before this is back at $9.80 and probably much higher as they move into the US.

Teladoc is cool, but every other EMR company is investing in telehealth and native integration will always beat a third party vendor.

SNDL Exec's use their stock as a personal ATM. Flooding the market with shares. The amount of movement needed to make this go from $1.00 to $5.00 is astronomical. Not to mention that SNDL Exec's can just dump more whenever they want.

Feel free to make a big brain play with your $$$. I'm not touching SNDL long term, only if another P&D occurs and I can catch the ride up."

Yes, the execs can dump more shares, I don't really care if they do or don't, what I do care is the company has a good outlook, it is competitive and the market for cannabis and products relative to it has just barely scratched the surface.  This company long term will only rise in value.  The P&D on something like SNDL has come and gone, now it is time for legitimate investors to take hold and see the possibilities forward.  This isn't a fake company or one that has no brands/products for sale that people can simply P&D like a penny stock, this company is legitimate with legitimate revenue, legitimate op expenses, and legitimate markets."

Prestashop is not a leading e-commerce platform. It’s a niche open source software mostly intended for small simple stores. Magento, Woocommerce,  Shopify dwarf it.

Reddit title says 300 mln, article says 300k, builtWith shows just 3k in the top million sites online use it, just 300 in top 100k sites.

Obviously only a fraction will choose to integrate into wish, and it will be for consolidating sales and inventory management into Prestashop, not to direct more traffic to wish.

Also integration already existed. One of the companies just paid a dev for a few weeks to build an “official” integration.

2021-06-14 11:50:12,wallstreetbets,I bought 300 shares at the $11 wall earlier. Hope that helped
2021-06-14 11:27:28,wallstreetbets,Sell those shares and buy call options instead
2021-06-14 11:54:40,wallstreetbets,Yesss. I am down 3k on both. Waiting for takeoff
2021-06-14 12:13:03,wallstreetbets,Please lower your voice. This is a public forum.
2021-06-14 11:47:57,wallstreetbets,I can see your retarded ass now face up against the window licking it in that Lambo
2021-06-14 12:24:33,wallstreetbets,Bought at 8 and didn't sell. It worth a hold
2021-06-14 12:24:16,wallstreetbets,Good luck buddy! That’s decent loss to cover and then some sweet tendies
2021-06-14 11:55:04,wallstreetbets,Thanks bud. We will all retire soon
2021-06-14 11:28:58,wallstreetbets,How do calls work? I see people talk about it but have no fucking idea how they work

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DoorDash ($DASH) puts back on the menu Hi all,

I know we're all having a great time and making bank with the memes, but I thought it would be good to put a different play out here for those that either missed out on the runup or have taken profits. This is a play that I have already discussed on here, and I feel that it is ready for another entry.

Previous posting here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwv46x/thinking\_about\_buying\_puts\_on\_doordash\_dash/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwv46x/thinking_about_buying_puts_on_doordash_dash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I got into $140p's and doubled my money last time, hoping for a similar outcome once again.

A quick rundown on $DASH, they are a food delivery app in which customers place orders for food from restaurants like McDonalds or Chick-Fil-A, then independent contractors (""dashers"") pick up the order and deliver it to the customer. Basically Uber but with food instead of taxis. 

I think we should all be pretty familiar with DoorDash after the pandemic, as many were forced to stay inside and obtain food through services like DoorDash and GrubHub, as well as Instacart for groceries.  DoorDash took advantage of this COVID boost and launched their IPO back in December, rocketing to a $60B valuation. Since then the stock has climbed over $200 per share, then with lockup expirations and cooling sentiment fell to a low of $110 back in May. Now it trades at $158 at the time of this writing.

Personally, I feel that this stock is extremely overvalued. At its current price, it trades at a price-to-sales multiple of 12.75, over its COVID-boosted revenues of $4B. And even in an environment that could not have been more perfect for their business, they still managed to lose money. Even with exorbitant delivery fees, DASH still effectively loses money with each order.

The economics of the food-delivery business are the biggest headwind to DASH at the present. They control the biggest slice of market share, but they are in fierce competition with GrubHub, Postmates, Uber Eats, Bite Squad, Waitr, and other smaller options. They all offer essentially the same service, which then eliminates pricing power, even for the current market leader. DASH can not raise their prices because customers would simply jump to another option. In actuality, DASH is actually being forced to lower fees, to work with restaurants, which they may be forced to push onto customers in order to stay solvent.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/doordash-offers-lower-priced-delivery-plans-amid-criticism.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/doordash-offers-lower-priced-delivery-plans-amid-criticism.html)

To make matters worse for DASH, is a looming debate on how gig workers (who make up DoorDash's delivery network) should be treated. There is a large and vocal constituency that wants dashers and Uber drivers to become employees of their respective companies, rather than working their own hours and being at the mercy of tips left by customers. It will be months at least before this could be put into law, but it is still a significant risk for these companies. It would effectively kill the business model, as well as DoorDash's finances, as they would now have to add thousands of employees to their payroll, provide benefits, and find a way to manage these workers. This also makes delivery a less appealing option for many drivers, as they would be less likely to be allowed to work on their own schedule. 

All things considered, DoorDash is not an attractive investment. It is trading at an obscene tech multiple while facing many serious potential headwinds. After reading all of that, does this sound like a company that should be up 16% in the past week? I know WSB has pumped some borderline insolvent names to all-time highs over the past month, but those spikes were on massive volume supplied by 10.5M retail apes. However DASH advanced 7% and 5% respectively on Thursday and Friday, respectively. However, both moves were made with almost exactly the average daily volume of 3M for the stock. Personally, I smell manipulation here. Nobody is rushing out to buy this stock or pumping it on message boards. 16% is not an outrageous move, but the lack of volume behind it suggests that it is not legit. If I am right, the share price will drift back to $130-140 as it has the previous times that it broke $155 in the past months.

TLDR: DoorDash is overvalued, stock still going up on low volume. Look for it to retreat into low $140's

Positions: I may have gotten too aggressive with my strike here, but I am holding 7/9/21 $140P's bought Friday. I am still confident that they will become profitable, but I would sleep better at night if I had waited till today and got $145s, maybe a little further out too. (Obligatory not financial advice)"
2021-06-14 11:06:33,wallstreetbets,"I have no DASH calls/puts, shares or shorts atm.

I worked for DoorDash in an operations role last year (not a driver, a real position).  The company treated me terribly while I was working and fired me without cause.  I hope they go to the earth's core."
2021-06-14 10:47:33,wallstreetbets,"No mention of the millions they just had to settle due to that class-action lawsuit of misclassified gig workers. I got mine in February/March through the Keller law firm, other law firms are still working out their cases for their clients but likely another pay out this year."
2021-06-14 11:01:14,wallstreetbets,"Cutthroat competition in the food delivery field. Uber losing tons of money on Ubereats, yes I see this as the future, but too much competition."
2021-06-14 16:51:44,wallstreetbets,"I have been making money off this stock both ways for months. Trying to predict its movement is a fools errand. It literally does the opposite of what it should be doing. Someone keeps pamping it up every time it falls even a little bit. 

Just be careful and go long with any puts. You may need the time."
2021-06-14 10:45:34,wallstreetbets,Everytime this goes near 150 I want to short it.
2021-06-14 11:33:03,wallstreetbets,"Door dash as a service is absolute garbage where I am. ~50% of orders were either just wrong or missing items. And when I did actually get my food it was often cold and fries were often inedible.

Door dash needs a major overhaul before I support it."
2021-06-14 10:48:35,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I don't normally tip my food delivery drivers, because I have placed over 50 to 100 food orders during the pandemic (NOT AN EXAGGERATION.) At the very least, the very minimum, I have recieved 57 orders that were cold, not prepared properly, had something missing / taken, and or had my food literally OPENED. 

I'm not tipping some fucker to give me what I didn't order, while it being cold. Fuck. That."
2021-06-14 11:04:29,wallstreetbets,It s trading at levels along with winter and summer rates (having reached over 200 in feb) so this doesn't seem so obvious of a short to me.
2021-06-14 11:08:18,wallstreetbets,"You know $DASH gets paid from both sides. 

20-30% from the restaurant 
$4+ from the customer 

So if you place a $20 chipotle order $DASH gets $10 ($7 after paying the driver $3 base) and chipotle gets $14."
2021-06-14 11:17:12,wallstreetbets,ok but aren't they the ones that have an open API and doesn't that give them a competitive advantage over the others?
2021-06-14 11:19:16,wallstreetbets,🏳️‍🌈🐻
2021-06-14 17:41:07,wallstreetbets,"Dash sucks.  Every food delivery service is getting so expensive my fat ass just picks up food now.  I have plenty of disposable income and only order 2 or 3 time a month when I'm too high to drive.  I cannot fathom low, moderate or middles class incomes paying 10 dollars or more extra for the already increasing menu prices"
2021-06-14 10:43:34,wallstreetbets,P/s is 12 so cheap 🌝. Look at mvis 1000 p/s or clover
2021-06-14 12:00:07,wallstreetbets,Do you know enough to be able to help start a DoorDash type company and service?
2021-06-14 11:41:55,wallstreetbets,Try tipping your drivers
2021-06-14 12:10:42,wallstreetbets,Dude.. you’re ordering food and you’re complaining about cold food? You know what delivery is right?
2021-06-14 11:01:41,wallstreetbets,"Drivers see the tip amount before they accept the trip.  No tip orders stay on the shelf until someone who lives a few blocks from you (and tips) places an order.  Your order is grabbed as an “I guess I can drive 2 blocks extra for $3”.  

Leave a $5 and you’ll get warm food.

Try it next time and see the difference."
2021-06-14 11:34:51,wallstreetbets,Literally sabotaged yourself by not tipping...rip
2021-06-14 11:05:44,wallstreetbets,"I don't know you and you don't know me but I'm very glad you don't as you sound like a massive piece of shit, something I feel many in your life also feel towards you. You don't tip the people driving YOUR food to YOU because YOUR ass is incapable or unable to go get it and you don't tip because of the place you ordered from fucking up? Many restaurants now seal their bags with stickers and shit so if you're still not tipping when an issue is no fault of the driver's you're a garbage human. I wish you nothing but the worst luck in your investments. DASH puts to the moon though otherwise"
2021-06-14 11:00:44,wallstreetbets,tip your  drivers man.
2021-06-14 10:55:23,wallstreetbets,It’s obviously not that bad as u have placed over 50 orders. Tip your delivery person you cheap cunt
2021-06-14 11:10:45,wallstreetbets,$200 was pre- share lockup expiration. I don’t think we’ll see those numbers anytime soon
2021-06-14 11:36:03,wallstreetbets,Wait. That math doesn't make sense. There's $4 that just randomly appear for some reason.
2021-06-14 12:19:53,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't at any senior level in the company.

Frankly, I'm not sure how a business of sending cold food to customers could ever thrive outside of government-imposed lockdowns."
2021-06-14 11:42:45,wallstreetbets,I do. Every trip. 13% because that's the best I can do. Still shit service.
2021-06-14 12:20:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. I do. Delivery shouldn't leave a dissatisfied customer more than 50% of the time.

And since I live in a typically *colder* region ""cold"" means basically refrigerated. There should be at least a *little* vestigial heat. 

I'm not coming from nowhere here. I'll see a ""at restaurant"" and then wait forty minutes *after* that for a barely 10 minute trip. Do you think food magically stays warm when just sitting on a passenger seat? (Or worse, since some of the drivers around me travel in pairs for security, the thought of my food down near someone's feet or in their lap. Disgusting.)

By giving them my money I have gained the absolute right to complain about the service. (I actually stopped using them because if how absolutely awful it was.)

But hey let's not have actually good services in the states. Why do that when you can suck the consumer dry of every penny, right? It's just the american way! Fuck everyone over until they hate you and then start again! How fun!

Fuck off. My hate of door dash is legitimate."
2021-06-14 11:04:31,wallstreetbets,Right lmao if i was a doordash driver i wouldnt touch his order
2021-06-14 11:38:06,wallstreetbets,"They take 20-30% of total order form the restaurant AND $4+ delivery fee the person ordering. 

They are a middle man charging both sides."
2021-06-14 12:53:55,wallstreetbets,"Well, not cold food .. other products that are in higher demand, higher margins and recession proof. And more about the operational side if I have a somewhat decent platform to be able to use"
2021-06-14 17:15:43,wallstreetbets,That’s why you complain about every order that’s bad and use the promotions. I turn my 20 meal into 15 and if it’s not right they’ll refund me.
2021-06-14 17:41:26,wallstreetbets,"I have stopped ordering food delivery for this very reason. Paying Tip + service charge on top of the jacked up price when you order through them (vs ordering directly with the restaurant), waiting an hour for soggy cold food isn’t worth it for me anymore. I pick up whenever I can now."
2021-06-14 12:31:42,wallstreetbets,I think you’re just being a little bitch honestly. Get your lazy fat ass up and pick up the food yourself then.
2021-06-14 11:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Oh I gotchu. 

Man fuck all the little fees that they quietly put in there."
2021-06-14 12:36:14,wallstreetbets,"Says a lot about your personality that you automatically think I'm lazy. You don't know what I do for a living. You don't know my physical condition. Maybe that's preventing me from *just doing it myself.* Your immediate assumptions are so telling of your biases.

Kinda sad how you saw my attacking a faceless company as an attack on you personally. Can't pick enough fights at your local preschool?"

2021-06-14 12:43:56,wallstreetbets,"Beautiful play, now the big question is how did you know CRSR will pump today? Like you had to have known something to pick up that many calls. Whats your secret?"
2021-06-14 10:43:44,wallstreetbets,"Nice dude. Lucky for you this was pumped on the sub all weekend, right after you bought. Wonder how many others happened to fall into this coincidence!"

2021-06-14 11:22:37,wallstreetbets,He didn’t
2021-06-14 11:24:57,wallstreetbets,Yes. Higher risk higher reward.
2021-06-14 16:21:43,wallstreetbets,"The answer you're looking for is likely implied volatility, these options' gains is higher than some of the other ones you've seen with similar moves because the implied volatility on CRSR calls was really low."
2021-06-14 18:13:59,wallstreetbets,"options in a very basic sense are time x price

His option expires in 5 days, if the stock price didn't move past $35, by Friday he would be -100%.

more time costs more money"

See you do understand the target market.

Wish has far better name recognition than Ali express does. And the people who use it KNOW its dollar store junk but are willing to take that risk on a $2 fluffy dog collar to wear for their wife's boyfriend.

I bought before it hit WSB just because it was ATL and I had a few bucks to throw into the casino.

Have a nice day and get your tendies."
2021-06-14 17:05:49,wallstreetbets,"not financial advice disclaimer. buying on margin is using loaned money to buy stocks using your existing money (principal) as collateral this is often done in multiples 2x 3x etc. Buying on margin has a sell requirement when the stock goes down a certain percent determined by how much you borrowed compared to the principal. 2x can go down further than 3x before the sell requirement kicks in.
 when this happens you lose some or all of your principal. If the stock goes up you pay back the bank the amount you borrowed plus interest, but you get to keep the profits. This amplifies your gains and losses, taking on more risk for increased profit potential.

Tldr buying on margin = higher potential profit for increased risk"

In addition it provides building solutions, cement trade maritime services, and IT solutions.

CX recently unveiled its plans to expand in the Dominican Republic and expects to recommission its production lines there, which would create a 33% boost to production in the Dominican Republic, creating a strong foothold and strengthening their position to serve the construction sector growth in the Caribbean.

In February of this year, CX expanded its network in Texas (where the stars are big and bright) by acquiring the ready-mix assets of Beck Readymix Concrete Co. based in San Antonio, which came with 3 concrete plants and one portable plant.

\-U.S. Operations reported net sales of $1B, an increase of 8% from the same period last year.

\-EBITDA grew by double-digits on a YOY basis in most regions due to an increase in cement volumes and cost savings.

\-Net Income for Q4 2020 was $70m in comparison to a loss of $237.8m from a year ago.

**2021 Q1 Earnings:**

**EPS:** Beat by $0.34

2021-06-14 10:32:07,wallstreetbets,Good stock for swing trading.
2021-06-14 11:32:02,wallstreetbets,"Also the bipartisan infrastructure bill will accelerate govt spending. Something like 700M allocated to roads, bridges, etc.

Also! The Vulcan buyout of US Concrete reduces competition.

And finally, the modernization of Indias roads is CXs bread and butter, but they recently acquired the TX component in preparation for their US expansion.

Overall, I'm bullish on these guys over the next couple years but this summer should be a great indicator."
2021-06-14 11:40:13,wallstreetbets,Cemex caught my eye a little earlier & I believe the stock will benefit hugely because of Biden administration. I’m gonna go buy some Oct 2021 calls right now

I wait till 10:30 and day traded this one. My rule and hard lesson learned from nnox is don’t buy a meme or popular stock in the first 30 minutes of market opening especially if it jumped in the premarket.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CNO = Rocket to moon because of unpopular washington state law Washington state politicians created a new law called Washington cares [WA Cares Fund (previously called Washington trust act).](http://www.wacaresfund.wa.gov/)

People have to get private LTC insurance or pay 0.58% of their post-tax income every year to get paltry benefits (this translates to 0.8-0.9% pre-tax). The benefits are capped at 35K/person lifetime and $100/day total. You have to keep paying it forever until you leave Washington and you lose benefits if you don't retire in Washington or don't contribute for 10 years.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/igp1zs89q8571.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=c96dc6c2af78dd78c14e154e8320304749dacd14

&#x200B;

There is no cap on wages. All wages and remuneration, including stock-based compensation, bonuses, paid time off, and severance pay, are all subject to the tax.

Currently, as the law stands, if you can just get insurance this year before November 1, you get an exemption and are all set for avoiding the WA LTC tax forever .. so if a family spends $450 on LTC this year for two healthy adults, they will save a lot of money if their income is over $100K and (as it stands from a few quotes I got) get better insurance benefits from private companies. The law incentivizes people to buy LTC for this year and quit next year, although many won't (the check presently is only once).

There is a poll on team blind (a networking site for professionals) and it shows how unpopular this payroll tax is going to be.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p9ra6xu5q8571.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=26c74b5d9c3ea29e4a43ea33518e671f8e303bb5

Here's the best part, it seems that the Washington Care law has made no difference on CNO price yet. This should lead to a positive earnings surprise for Wallstreet.

&#x200B;

I personally have been trying to get LTC insurance - a few LTC agents I managed to contact so far have said they are flooded people buying quotes and people are being told to start the process by June to guarantee insurance by October."
2021-06-14 10:33:58,wallstreetbets,#fuckInslee
2021-06-14 10:44:33,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah I can’t wait to pay for long term care insurance decades before financial professionals recommend it. And for a whopping 35k, enough to carry me over for like a week in a long term care facility! 

And we mostly found out about it by email the month before our COLA. NEAT

Thanks for the recommendation, maybe I can make back some of the money I’m about to lose."
2021-06-14 10:42:31,wallstreetbets,But LTC insurance is WAY more expensive than $450/year (for most people).

2021-06-14 11:08:04,wallstreetbets,"Heres a question coming from someone that really doesn't have a clue. Whats the ""No-BS"" high point we could reasonably see from this stock? I've seen people wishing on it rocketing past $100+, then I see estimates of around $80."
2021-06-14 12:19:37,wallstreetbets,I'm so sad I sold at $12 :( I thought for sure it was going to skip again before sky rocketing
2021-06-14 12:49:28,wallstreetbets,Is this the rh web app?
2021-06-14 19:35:37,wallstreetbets,How on earth anyone could still use Robin Hood is beyond me. Seriously consider switching to a legit broker so something doesn’t happen to your sweet trendies my man

2021-06-14 17:24:52,wallstreetbets,i sold 300 of my 400 shares at 14.50 then bought back at 18 lol
2021-06-14 16:55:49,wallstreetbets,"I think I bought your share and still holding not
Letting go till triple digits. 
Buy. Hold that’s the name of the game."
2021-06-14 17:14:52,wallstreetbets,That's not buying and holding is it??  You didn't follow the rules.  Good day sir....I SAID GOOD DAY
2021-06-14 19:44:53,wallstreetbets,"Yep the only thing I can see stoping that train is if the CEO was to issue more shares in order to give himself a bonus, which would be totally out of character for the AMC CEO. 

Edit: *one of many things that will stop that train."
2021-06-14 10:28:59,wallstreetbets,"That likely won't happen, though. I've yet to see a logical reason for it blowing past $100. Just having it reach $80 would be amazing for anyone who invested into it early on.  
  
Edit: still no logic to be seen, outside of ""plz buy stock I also spent money on"". People really do just be here trying to pump their own numbers."

2021-06-14 11:24:12,wallstreetbets,"No one knows but hoping for triple figures by end of week which is possible if volume and fomo comes in. 

High figures can be reached if people hold and not give in. $80 and $100 is way too low for me and the people I've spoken to. I have an average price of just about $10.

I will sell on way down there is no way to top tick this."
2021-06-14 11:20:35,wallstreetbets,We haven't had the squeeze yet and we're near $60 so do with that what you will
2021-06-14 17:15:41,wallstreetbets,if it cracks 60 I expect a mad run up
2021-06-14 16:43:41,wallstreetbets,"Never sell all at once, better keep half, if you're not sure"
2021-06-14 19:43:00,wallstreetbets,I found the streaker.

2021-06-14 10:29:57,wallstreetbets,You'll be the guy buying at $100. You and all the other doubters. Going to be fun 😎
2021-06-14 10:56:29,wallstreetbets,I guess you do not have a fundamental understanding of how a gamma squeeze or a short squeeze works. Because there are very logical explanations of how it can go over 100
2021-06-14 19:40:48,wallstreetbets,"Logic in this fantasy world gets you downvoted, my friend."
2021-06-14 16:18:11,wallstreetbets,I started Thursday and I think you're more full of shit than a sewer
2021-06-14 11:20:03,wallstreetbets,All I’m hearing is “10 shares = Brazillionaire”. I’m for it
2021-06-14 10:31:05,wallstreetbets,"Not a chance lol, I'm not that retarded. I'd consider buying in if it dipped below $40, but above that and it's not worth the risk."
2021-06-14 10:57:42,wallstreetbets,"If there are then explain, because I haven't seen it. I just see people here trying to pump the numbers of a stock they bought into lol."
2021-06-14 19:57:07,wallstreetbets,Evidently so lol
2021-06-14 17:06:57,wallstreetbets,"That's nice dear, enjoy holding bags down the road."
2021-06-14 10:43:06,wallstreetbets,"That's what people said about $GME. 

That's what people said about $AMC at $9, $13, $38....."
2021-06-14 10:56:45,wallstreetbets,"GME doesn't have over 450M outstanding shares. AMC is very overvalued right now, and simply not worth buying in at the price it is at given the risk. Sorry that I actually like to think things out instead of blindly following the herd lol."
2021-06-14 11:00:31,wallstreetbets,Your loss. We'll hit $70 again.
2021-06-14 12:51:08,wallstreetbets,Is traditional valuation even a fair metric for AMC? The  significant manipulation and float owned by retail combined with hype are driving prices from what I can see.
2021-06-14 11:02:43,wallstreetbets,"Never said you wouldn't. The volatility could spike it up there again. But expecting it to ""blow past $100"" is just silly. AMC is not a company worth $45B+."
2021-06-14 14:54:51,wallstreetbets,Which is a big reason why I don't consider it worth the risk at this point. The risk of losing is higher than that of gaining to buy in at this point unless it dips again.
2021-06-14 17:31:02,wallstreetbets,"Just screen shot this comment, I will be posting it once it blows over 100"
2021-06-14 15:13:05,wallstreetbets,I literally explained it to you why It can easily get over a hundred. And you just ignore it and continue your fud.

Wish has a market cap of 6.62B as of typing this right now and sales of 2.87B with 2.68B in cash.

the P/S is 2.3.

Are you fucking kidding me if this stock isn't undervalued I don't know what is.

There are 0 sell ratings by analysts and 83% of analysts give it a BUY.

\-----Competitors

$JMIA Jumia Technologies.

A 3B market cap company with 167 million dollars in sales with a P/S of 17.68 is currently worth 30 dollars. 167 MILLION IN SALES IS WORTH 30 DOLLARS A STOCK????

\>>>Jumia Technologies connects countries in Africa such as Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, etc... [https://group.jumia.com/](https://group.jumia.com/)

$POSH Poshmark

3.4B market cap company with 285 million dollars in sales with a P/S of 11.92 currently sitting at 47.70 dollars per stock.

Positions: 1,000 shares of WISH and 6/18 $15 calls

TL;DR - WISH is an undervalued company statistically and also extremely undervalued if you compare it to its peers such as $JMIA and $POSH.  Wish is a worldwide e-commerce (100+ countries) while $JMIA is only Africa and $POSH is US, CANADA, and AUSTRALIA.

&#x200B;

 

I have bought from WISH before and I know people that have bought from Wish. If your argument is that Wish sells cheap goods, then you've already lost the argument. Wish is an e-commerce that hosts individuals and stores just like how Shopify $SHOP hosts individuals and stores. Wish does not sell the goods themselves. They host the people selling the goods. Shopify $SHOP is known for dropshippers selling goods from $BABA 's aliexpress which are LITERALLY cheap chinese goods.

So the argument which is that Wish sells cheap shit is flawed and incorrect unless you also say the same about Shopify, Amazon, Aliexpress, etc..."

2021-06-14 10:24:18,wallstreetbets,"To tell you the truth.. From a swede. 

We used wish pretty heavy a couple years ago, (we had some deal with china, shipping was kinda subsidized, so very cheap for china to send to Sweden. But swedish gouverment realised this was an outdated policy and snapped it right off. Making buying on wish as expensive as in a local store. This made people less horny on direct-order from china and in this wave, the buying pressure settle down hard. People alsom realized that they dont like to buy “shit” from china with no guaranties. 

So alot of us started to fuck with wish, saying products was broken/no function on arrival, and as the process is easy to manipulate, we started to get free stuff by doing this. 

Then the pandemic broke and people hate china even more atm. People have start to look at “made in china” as a signature for supporting a country who wants to poison the whole world in the struggle to take it all over while committing genocide. 

What I want to say is: Fuck China. Leave them to rott

If you talk to a Chinese about wish, he will tell you its a store to rip of dumb westerns"

2021-06-14 11:44:32,wallstreetbets,You should stick to facts about cats.
2021-06-14 12:45:00,wallstreetbets,They can’t because they’re a bot lol.
2021-06-14 12:42:40,wallstreetbets,There’s plenty of info. Do your DD. WISH🚀
2021-06-14 11:31:20,wallstreetbets,Good way to not get burned trading.  Still a hf pump and dump gonna burn a lot of wsb
2021-06-14 10:19:58,wallstreetbets,"I have 300 shares in wish, but it’s an absolute dog shit marketplace .  You buy a blow up swimming pool, and get a keychain swimming pool.  The stock probably is undervalued, but please don’t tell me it’s a quality marketplace."
2021-06-14 10:20:56,wallstreetbets,"Ok… so how are posh and wish competitors? Also you’re right, wish doesn’t sell cheap goods, their sellers do."
2021-06-14 16:41:24,wallstreetbets,"Who's gonna tell this kid that adding tickers doesn't make his argument valid lmao

You genuinely think wish isn't just dropshippers?

Wish exclusively hosts the sale of cheap dropshipping goods, every single item on it can be had on AliExpress for a fraction of the price.

Shopify sells an e-commerce service that can be used to sell cheap Chinese goods, completely different. A lot of legitimate businesses use Shopify to sell their product.

Amazon is a legitimate e-commerce platform that can host cheap Chinese goods but isn't known for it, again, completely different.

Wish isn't undervalued, most people just don't consider it a long term investment due to the fact that they have very few return customers, a bad reputation for cheap shitty goods, and rely on false advertising. Hence why even though it is a ""buy buy buy"" most investors wouldn't personally touch it with a 10-foot pole.

You're trying to argue that they're undervalued and at the end of the day your instinct might be right, but you clearly don't know shit about their business practice (or the practice of Amazon and Shopify for that matter)"
2021-06-14 12:59:28,wallstreetbets,"Wish is a shitty marketplace, Shopify is an integration platform. Completely different type of product being sold."
2021-06-14 12:33:42,wallstreetbets,No he wasn’t… he seems to think the price of a stock is an equal measure of company value across all company’s
2021-06-14 15:29:28,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that is what he was referring to"
2021-06-14 11:54:16,wallstreetbets,"Here at post-GME WSB we only buy stock thats at ATHs and up 50% in a month /s

My $wish oct 15 7.5c are looking great today though"
2021-06-14 11:51:54,wallstreetbets,"I just looked it up, yeah my information was wrong. Unsure what I was looking at."
2021-06-14 16:49:20,wallstreetbets,It really is..
2021-06-14 13:15:04,wallstreetbets,Posting in free karma subs and then immediately comes here to spam WISH posts
2021-06-14 12:46:23,wallstreetbets,"Has anyone gotten, ir known anyone that has gotten, anything from Wish that wasn't utter cheap shit? 🙄"
2021-06-14 12:45:32,wallstreetbets,"I believe in DD and personal experience. I have never known one order from WISH to be anything other than misrepresented, ill-fitting, cheap shit. I hope you make some money. But I think so many people have gotten burned, it will take a lot for the market to look at Wish favorably again."
2021-06-14 11:32:13,wallstreetbets,Can’t hurt if I never sell.
2021-06-14 15:20:42,wallstreetbets,"I was referring to the first comment in this thread… the guy who replied missed the point that mkt cap is what matters and not share price. Sure brand power and future earnings play a part, but the most important factor is MARKET CAP"
2021-06-14 12:47:14,wallstreetbets,">the price of a stock is an equal measure of company value across all company’s

Is it not? A house sold at 1M is a house valued at 1M even though it might be worth 100K in a different location (and vice versa)."
2021-06-14 15:31:42,wallstreetbets,"Smooth brain here, missed the joke and see it now. A new wrinkle must be forming."
2021-06-14 12:06:50,wallstreetbets,No biggie. Just let me know if your negative predictions come true while I take a nap so I can gtfo.
2021-06-14 13:16:09,wallstreetbets,"I’ve seen 50+ bots for Wish Clov CLNE, i usually get downvoted for calling them out. Look at my comment history."
2021-06-14 12:49:12,wallstreetbets,Maybe one person ever lmao. Even their ads I’ve seen are completely garbage haha. This is a pump and dump forsure.
2021-06-14 13:57:06,wallstreetbets,I've bought clothes and hair accessories that weren't complete shit. 60% shit maybe. I've got some hard drives arriving tomorrow from Wish for such a low price that I absolutely must be getting scammed.
2021-06-14 13:05:54,wallstreetbets,Sorry you had such bad experiences with it. I’ve bought really effective merchandise at a quarter of the cost. But I have heard of others with similar experiences as you. At the same time I don’t buy work tools from The dollar store.
2021-06-14 11:34:22,wallstreetbets,Not quite true but good theory
2021-06-14 15:31:35,wallstreetbets,Where do you think market cap comes from? Future earnings and brand power… among many other things
2021-06-14 13:25:37,wallstreetbets,"The apt comparison is market cap, since that refers to how much the company is worth. Share price is worthless to compare across companies, because it's just market cap divided by the number of shares, and the number of shares can be highly variable for any two companies."
2021-06-14 13:15:02,wallstreetbets,"No, not even close."
2021-06-14 13:16:46,wallstreetbets,That’s not an apt comparison at all.

2021-06-14 13:20:34,wallstreetbets,I’ve been calling WISH out as a PnD since it started as well. SI was never 50% like was being posted. It’s 8%. When it all started the daily thread was full of new/dormant accounts just posting the ticker with no other info
2021-06-14 13:11:08,wallstreetbets,"Wish is a dollar store. Only when you order one hammer, it shows up with two handles. 🙄"
2021-06-14 11:35:58,wallstreetbets,Okay then would you like to tell me what to do?
2021-06-14 11:45:44,wallstreetbets,Wish is the flea market of the Internet
2021-06-14 15:43:48,wallstreetbets,Lol. You’re missing the point… share price * shares = market cap. The op was comparing share price as if that means anything. The original comment thread I replied to was pointing that out. I’m well aware how valuations work. Also this is wsb so go fuck yourself and have a good day
2021-06-14 13:22:25,wallstreetbets,The amount of >1 year old accounts here spamming stocks is insane. Either the mods are actually retarded or they’re involved in this.
2021-06-14 14:06:56,wallstreetbets,Dollar trees IPO was 1.16 now it’s at 100. Dollar general IPO 22 now 200. I appreciate useful criticism but you’re just trolling sir.

It's probably fake man... and under watchlists too.  O.o  Probably made their own copycat HTML page but screwed up on the typo?"

And have inconsistent post history. It’s almost hilarious how bad they are at hiding the fact they are working for somebody.

2021-06-14 17:46:31,wallstreetbets,3% in a day is an excellent return.
2021-06-14 12:10:03,wallstreetbets,Ya no shit this is the equivalent of someone investing $1000 and is up to $1031. Congrats on being rich though.
2021-06-14 14:22:42,wallstreetbets,"First of all, I was up the 30k in the first 5 minutes. That’s what is showing in the screenshot - not any realized gain. 

Second, I didn’t risk $1 mil in CRSR. The level I entered at is pretty safe for a variety of reasons. If the big rally today fades, I’ll be happy holding it for a while and I’ll do just fine."

2021-06-14 19:22:45,wallstreetbets,Am I misreading that the gain on those CRSR shares is 3.6%? Meaning that the OP just bought these shares?
2021-06-14 16:15:25,wallstreetbets,That post was right after I purchased. The gain has varied from up $225k to up $0. I haven’t sold so god only knows where the gain ends up.
2021-06-14 18:54:02,wallstreetbets,Thank you!!!
2021-06-14 14:15:59,wallstreetbets,I wish!

2021-06-14 14:26:26,wallstreetbets,Check out my previous post.
2021-06-14 16:20:22,wallstreetbets,Bro. I bought it a few hours ago and it’s moving wildly from up $225k to up $0. I wouldn’t say it’s had enough time to age at all.
2021-06-14 14:35:58,wallstreetbets,Too high already. Catch it on a pull back if there is a good one.
2021-06-14 15:03:42,wallstreetbets,It will get there. Don’t be afraid to double down on quality stocks when they pull back 25%.
2021-06-14 15:02:41,wallstreetbets,Exactly. This is a good investment with meme stock momentum. That’s why I felt fine putting in $1M.
2021-06-14 15:49:16,wallstreetbets,I have both.  But there are more tables in this casino buddy. Get a clue.
2021-06-14 15:52:31,wallstreetbets,Thank you! This one is all over the place this morning. I hope I stick the landing!
2021-06-14 16:22:50,wallstreetbets,Negative. I was fucking around with trying to get my account to not be “fake” all effing morning. I’m in still. We’ll see how it plays out.
2021-06-14 14:24:05,wallstreetbets,Geezus Sherlock. Get a day job. It’s real.
2021-06-14 16:37:11,wallstreetbets,Duly noted. I loved CRSR at $32 before all this so I’m not too worried.
2021-06-14 14:27:52,wallstreetbets,Yes! 🚀
2021-06-14 14:28:48,wallstreetbets,Clearly it’s all fake. Move on.
2021-06-14 14:48:43,wallstreetbets,"It’s not a realized gain. I just invested it this morning. Let’s give it some time. Geezus, since when do you have to exit a position within 5 hours of initiating it?"
2021-06-14 12:18:22,wallstreetbets,"Character limitations for the account description. Jesus, you are an idiot."
2021-06-14 12:49:05,wallstreetbets,Clearly.
2021-06-14 14:47:52,wallstreetbets,Vetted by mods. They gave me a rectal exam.
2021-06-14 14:49:18,wallstreetbets,I love my money making distractions.
2021-06-14 14:34:54,wallstreetbets,"First of all, I’m in both of those. But there are more tables at this casino than the one you are sitting at. This is WALLSTREETBETS. Not r/AMC&GME."

2021-06-14 17:33:20,wallstreetbets,😂 i needed that comment. Just doing my part.
2021-06-14 18:41:59,wallstreetbets,This isn’t gain porn. It’s a YOLO. And I’d like to see you put up $1M of shares in a single stock. If I’m a pussy what the hell are you?
2021-06-14 15:01:30,wallstreetbets,Rich retard.
2021-06-14 15:01:37,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-14 15:48:40,wallstreetbets,I know. It happened so effing fast this morning.
2021-06-14 16:11:32,wallstreetbets,Yep. This baby is moving around a lot. The rips are not lasting as long as they used to!
2021-06-14 16:18:48,wallstreetbets,"I tried that and it didn’t have enough info for the mods. In TD I can’t simply insert qty though or purchase price. But yes, the trade info in the watchlist is the actual trade info."
2021-06-14 16:38:22,wallstreetbets,Me too!
2021-06-14 18:18:57,wallstreetbets,"low float, high short interest, lower multiples compared to Logitech, low market cap, high revenue relative to market cap"
2021-06-14 17:36:06,wallstreetbets,My account wouldn’t have the balance it does if that were the case.
2021-06-14 18:29:12,wallstreetbets,That’s not my gain. That was what I was up just minutes after initiating my position. My flair says YOLO not GAIN.
2021-06-14 16:38:03,wallstreetbets,Homie. I bought very far from the top. Which is why I’m at breakeven right now after the drop.
2021-06-14 17:35:10,wallstreetbets,"Not as a big a risk as you think. Shares vs options provide me a much better ability to ride out a stock like this and avoid losing money. It was a free bet. Plus, I haven’t realized any gain or loss."
2021-06-14 18:17:20,wallstreetbets,lol CRSR is far from a boomer stock; doesn't even pay dividends
2021-06-14 18:27:02,wallstreetbets,That was about 30 seconds after I opened the position genius.
2021-06-14 11:15:46,wallstreetbets,That doesn't mean shit. He gets to name his own account and he might have spelled it Nathan's Accoun by accident. Just like how the account above is WSB.
2021-06-14 11:52:47,wallstreetbets,"You say that with conviction? Yet I’ve posted the actual screen shots from my TD account and posted the full screen shots of my entire TD account and account summary to my Reddit profile. And sent them to the mod working on this. Seriously, you shouldn’t do that and it makes you look like someone who doubts there is anyone in the world who has a few million dollars. Wtf man?! This might not be the right sub for you."
2021-06-14 11:16:27,wallstreetbets,"I mean that could be a custom name for the account that he misspelled there or AT is cropping off custom account names.

Normally it says ""Trading - 35678XXXXXX"" but I assume you can give custom names or something, not familiar with AT"
2021-06-14 11:38:48,wallstreetbets,"It says it at the top too, so I think it's a typo in his account name but also a legit screenshot."

I’m 25 but I’m familiar with a 60, 70, or 80 hour work week. I’ve been working since I was 16. Hanging and finishing drywall for 40 hours then 40 of side work. Getting home at 2 am just to wake up and go to work at 7 am. Me and my wife have about 25k in investments, and 7k in savings, a nice car and a crappy truck both paid off, no debt. And a retirement fund so hopefully I can retire before my body craps out on me.

2021-06-14 16:28:26,wallstreetbets,I bought some $37 puts... when it’s 40. I don’t feel safe to hold on meme stock. I mean crsr is good and I sold my in Jan. But as now it’s being mentioned in wsb. I’m not sure if it’s pump and dump only... personally I’ll wait a little bit to invest it. Now is just day trade for me.
2021-06-14 18:20:52,wallstreetbets,did you sell covered calls?
2021-06-14 16:30:25,wallstreetbets,"this was a classic WSB Pump n Dump and its on the way back down

Best of luck man, im hoping that your good tomorrow. I just posted the option statistics for the day so maybe that will help."
2021-06-14 12:58:42,wallstreetbets,Nothing odd at all about a Reddit user who’s last posts were 200 days ago. Made no follow up comments to them. Then magically within the last 5 days has a shit load of posts and comments. Doesn’t post or comment to anything outside of wallstreetbets. And has no other interests. Not to mention the fact that you are yoloing 1 million dollars on a single stock. Not saying this 100% the case but anyone on here with half a brain can see your account doesn’t fall into the bucket of normal Reddit poster. And should be wary of it.
2021-06-14 13:52:37,wallstreetbets,"oh I see how OP did it, thanks man!"
2021-06-14 17:35:24,wallstreetbets,Im super bullish on crsr though don’t get me wrong just your cost basis is a bit rough but in a year or so theres money to be made for sure
2021-06-14 18:52:04,wallstreetbets,Wasn’t even calling you a pussy btw just pointing out how much WSB has changed since i joined two years ago

2021-06-14 11:34:52,wallstreetbets,Yeah the TD Ameritrade think or swim post are overwhelmingly fake. They always seem to cut out the big yellow banner at the top that shows it's a paper and then you get no response when asking them to show entire page

2021-06-14 12:05:56,wallstreetbets,"Wow. Really? And all the upvotes for this lame ass comment? So sad. 

Yes, people make a few million dollars by “photoshop”. I’m guessing you and most, if not all, of those who upvoted will never see this kind of money in their lifetime because they can’t comprehend that people can become financially successful. Your mindset is going to prevent you from ever seeing money like this. And those that see that it’s actually possible to have a trading account like this without photoshop fabrication will likely find much more financial success than you will. Good luck u/brawlstrap."

2021-06-14 10:59:28,wallstreetbets,"Idk if crsr is such a meme stock. Yes since last week there's mentions on wsb about crsr. But anybody who built a computer before will know about Corsair cuz their product are very good. And they ipoed last year at $15-20, I have been in since then believing in the company since they only have $3bil valuation. So I wouldn't call crsr a meme stock, but it is currently being memed yes"
2021-06-14 11:55:14,wallstreetbets,"Definitely not a meme stock. Been invested for months. Just because it’s mentioned in WSB, doesn’t mean it’s instantly a meme stock… jeez"

2021-06-14 15:10:45,wallstreetbets,I have made lots of money investing in real estate. I’m certainly not betting it all on this meme stock.  I’m investing what I can afford to lose.
2021-06-14 19:15:28,wallstreetbets,I'm not betting it all on a meme stock. I own plenty of other assets. This position could go to zero and I would be just fine. And CRSR won't go to zero. It's a solid stock that has about 10-15% downside from where I purchased at $37. That's nothing. This was a free hand.
2021-06-14 18:32:51,wallstreetbets,Much thanks and good luck to you! It sounds like you won't need it though!

2021-06-14 19:41:06,wallstreetbets,Not saying every single one is but this one in particular looks odd. There is something to be said about consistency.

Option C - lottery

2021-06-14 18:00:13,wallstreetbets,">cuz their product are very good

The scroll wheel on my Scimitar begs to differ. Shit broke in like 2 months. And one of the fans on my H100i. And 1/4 of the RGB LEDs on the H100i. 

In fairness, I bought two RM series power supplies that have never caused any problems, even with OC’s applied to both the CPU and GPU. One is well over 5 years old and the other has ~18 months on it. Plus 4 RGB RAM sticks, one headset and two cases, all of which have been just fine. 

In my experience, their products are hit or miss. More likely to hit than they are to miss, but still not guaranteed to be solid."
2021-06-14 11:36:26,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Corsair, Logitech, AMD, and Nvidia all have some serious upside at their current prices (maybe less so Nvidia after it jumped $650 to $700"
2021-06-14 16:10:16,wallstreetbets,I bought their products over 10 years ago and they were solid then. I wouldn’t call this a meme stock either based on the prices of hardware lately. I wish I had a million to put into them but hey not all of us get as lucky as OP for our hard work.
2021-06-14 15:32:47,wallstreetbets,It's a meme stock for sure... Meme stock just means it's been pushed on WSB by people claiming rediculous valuations. I have seen people claiming $100 by the end of the month - that's what makes it a meme - no reason to be valued that high but people claiming it ia getting others to buy in behind and pump the stock.
2021-06-14 18:30:12,wallstreetbets,Sorry I hurt your feelings by calling your stock a meme.

2021-06-14 14:22:48,wallstreetbets,Yep I noticed this was the case with like 75% of all the meme stock DD posters within the last couple weeks.

2021-06-14 16:02:10,wallstreetbets,"Meme stock means it’s mentioned on WSB? So all stocks mentioned on WSB are meme stocks? That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard today.

However, I’m following along on you saying how these predictions are crazy. It’s currently at very low valuation. But $100 at the end of the month is never going to happen, period. Imo, a meme stock is a stock that relies heavily on hype where the fundamentals do not represent the valuation. This stock has a lot of room to grow and doesn’t come close to representing its fair valuation. It relies on fundamentals, not hype.

People can hype it as much as they want, it might P&D for a short time, but it will go back to its fair valuation which is way higher than the current. That’s what sets it apart from a meme stock."
2021-06-14 18:51:05,wallstreetbets,"First. It’s not “my stock”.

Yea im pretty new investor only 3 years of experience, but I get stock split is not meant to start a bullrun I think it's pretty common knowledge... Also apple had 4 stock split now and it haven't seen the end times yet.... And I also think Nvidia and Tesla will be just fine after, so calm down?"

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Velodyne Lidar (VLDR) is going to pop off this year; probably this month. (NOT a fucking squeeze) (First DD) Not financial advice, just my opinion after doing a little light research. I own shares/options in this company because I think it is a solid short term and long term play, not a fucking squeeze with short ladder attacks and 169% open short interest float.

**Short Term Bull Signals**

Velodyne is being added to the Russel 2000 at the end of June. For those of you that don’t know, The Russel 2000 is an index focusing on small-cap *growth* companies in the US. *On average stocks in the 2020 Russel 2000 grow by 50% in the year after inclusion*. I think VLDR is above average. Price target is $25 in the next 12 months 

It’s on sale at ~$11.25 as of this DD, which is approaching their 52 week low of  $8.97. They currently have a buy rating from Yahoo finance with a price target in the high teens. (I think that’s low. I like the stock.)

**Long Term Bull Signals**

LIDAR gear is used for autonomous machines (cars, trucks, drones, UAVs, submersibles, and robots) and making maps of shit that’s hard to map (more on this below). This is a huge growth industry right now.

Velodyne makes their own LIDAR hardware and software. “People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.” -Alan Kay (and Steve Jobs)
This is the tech version of vertical integration

**Who are they selling this tech shit to: Badass companies, mostly**

* Gatik (Fucking Walmart uses Gatik trucks) uses Velodyne Lidar for their autonomous middle-mile delivery trucks. [https://gatik.ai](https://gatik.ai)

* NASA is sending Velodyne sensors to the moon on their VIPER lunar rover. [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20130009106/downloads/20130009106.pdf](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20130009106/downloads/20130009106.pdf) 

* Seabed Geosolutions just selected Velodyne to map the ocean for energy companies. You know, energy, the thing the world is consuming 50% more of every decade? [https://www.seabed-geo.com](https://www.seabed-geo.com) 

* Exclusively supplying lidar devices to Faraday Future. They’re a maker of sexy future cars that just got injected with $1 billion of investment and are about to get listed on Nasdaq [https://www.ff.com](https://www.ff.com) 

* Knightscope selected Velodyne Lidar’s technology to power its 5th Generation Robocops. [https://www.knightscope.com](https://www.knightscope.com) 

* Idriverplus uses Velodyne sensors in street cleaners, passenger cars and logistics vehicles in China [https://www.autofutures.tv/2021/04/29/from-driverless-street-cleaners-to-cars-idriverplus-powers-the-new-autonomous-revolution/](https://www.autofutures.tv/2021/04/29/from-driverless-street-cleaners-to-cars-idriverplus-powers-the-new-autonomous-revolution/)

**The Fundamentals**

* They have NO DEBT: $383.6 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet at March 31, 2021

* Consistent revenue: Over a third of their sales are to customers with multi-year agreements

* Growth: Velodyne ahs 191 projects in the pipeline and expect to generate 1 billion in revenue by 2025

* Momentum: GAAP gross profit was 1.9 million in Q1 2021 compared to GAAP gross loss of 5.3 million in Q4 2020

* They have regulatory connections to help them navigate smart city shit critical for autonomous vehicles: Just appointed Deborah Hersman, former chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to their board of directors

All of this info is in the notes from their last investors' meeting: [https://investors.velodynelidar.com/static-files/564daf3b-2164-4225-8e7e-f20a7a27adca](https://investors.velodynelidar.com/static-files/564daf3b-2164-4225-8e7e-f20a7a27adca) 

**To the Rainbow Bears who want to talk about MVIS**

I think MVIS is an OK play, but VLDR has products on the street on at least three continents, no debt, and is literally headed for the moon. This is a big market, and while I think there's room enough for both, I prefer VLDR to MVIS.

**TL;DR:**

Company with no debt and growth trajectory has been blessed by the MM's. It's going to pop this month and then double up this year. NASA uses them for spaceships. I like the stock. Not financial advice.

Positions: 50 shares at $11.25; calls for 6/18 $22.5, $30, $35, $40; 7/16 $20; 9/17 $35

My options strategy makes no sense; don’t read too much into it. I mostly bought the early ones on a goof with my casino money. After doing a little digging on a lark, and liking what I found, I made some more sensible long term plays and picked up the stock. Im planning on holding for 9 months and then re-evaluating.

This is my first DD. If you don't like it ~~I'm really sorry~~ fuck off."
2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"VUZI: A Bullish Thesis # What They Do:

Vuzix, or VUZI, is an optical company (producing smart glasses) that is now over 20 years old (so it isn't a bullshit company based out of someone's garage... \*cough\* CLOV \*cough\*) and is one of the leading companies for supplying smart glasses and augmented reality technologies... they're also on track to receiving several juicy military contracts from the US government (these are like infinite money hacks since everyone knows that US defense contracting is OP as a revenue source) as their company's origins are in military display solutions (remember when the US government introduced [these literal ESP/wallhack goggles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/24/army-night-vision-goggles/)? They make stuff like that and are rumored to be receiving more government contracts [like this one](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vuzix-enters-agreement-leading-u-145000753.html) from a few months ago). This is a huge revenue stream that is only going to continue growing over the next several years. In addition, they also sell computer display devices and software, a market that will only continue to grow and provide an additional solid revenue stream as there's always going to be some chimp on WSB that needs a computer monitor to see their overnight millionaire gains. But, let's talk about what you all only give a shit about, since no one actually cares what these companies do:

&#x200B;

# DD/Due Diligence, Why This Stock WILL Moon:

VUZI is soon to be added to the Russell 2000 and 3000 indexes, bringing more exposure and attention to this already great company. [Even Cathie Wood went $13.5m in on the company's stock dip a week back](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/cathie-wood-buys-13-5m-in-smart-glasses-supplier-vuzix-on-dip-1030479660). Oh, and their company's main point of interest, the augmented reality market, is expected to grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth revenue) of 43.8% YOY from 2021 to 2028, reaching a market size of **$340.16 billion USD** in 2028. **That is 12.7x the current market size of $26.75 billion USD**. Boiled down: augmented reality market will go to the moon. Vuzix's current market cap is $1.2 billion, or 4.5% of the total market. If the company stays at a similar percentage of the total market cap by 2028, it'll reach a valuation of $15.3 billion. That is nearly **15x its current size**. But it doesn't stop there, the **percentage of total shares shorted is at 17.08%... For reference, AMC has 20% of its total shares shorted and it FUCKING MOONED**. Though, unlike other companies with high short interests, this one has a solid structure and great future. It IS a good company. There is not only a short-squeeze play here, but the company is solid and has a small market cap with tons of room to grow at only $1.2 billion... AMC has a market cap of $24.76 billion and if we see a squeeze even HALF the size of AMC's, **VUZI can stand to 10x its current valuation and reach a share price of $190 up from $19... that's a shit ton of gains to buy a whole lot of Wagyu steaks and tables at Nobu.**

&#x200B;

**But it still doesn't stop there. Though, bear in mind the next bit of DD is highly speculative:**

I can see military contracts growing over the next 1-2 years. And not just by a little, but by a huge fucking amount. Explosive, some may even call it (yes, pun intended). [We may very well see ourselves in WWIII](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/06/07/anticipating-war-with-china-the-us-air-force-is-spreading-across-the-pacific/) by 2023, and with wars, there are war dogs. People that profiteer off governments hemorrhaging money into building bigger and better armies. Playing companies that reside in the military industrial complex, especially high growth military tech companies like VUZI, can stand to make you all millionaires. And, as they say: ""Never let a good crisis go to waste."" In the event that all hell breaks loose, at least you'll all be enjoying your $$$ tendies from a multi-million dollar home. Be the war dogs and fight for your country financially.

&#x200B;

**Finally, it still isn't even close to ATH. Sitting at $19 per share as I write this, VUZI reached $31 per share on April 8, 2021. That's a 63% difference from its current share price. Or, as I like to call it, the potential to reach** ***at least*** **a 63% gain (+$12) if this stock receives the right exposure.**

&#x200B;

# Where I Can See It Headed:

Honestly, who the fuck knows. But, if I had to place bets, I can see it reaching $30 in the next 2 weeks if it receives the right exposure to retail investors. In addition, this price is not a ""pump and dump"" like AMC nearly striking $70, VUZI's price will hold strong regardless of where it ends up because VUZI is a solid company that has great growth potential over the next few years. Even if it doesn't receive the attention it deserves, I would urge anyone reading this to buy just a few shares to hold in your long term portfolios. You won't regret it.

&#x200B;

Any comments/questions/concerns are appreciated. I'll do my best to answer them. But, like any other human, I cannot predict the future. This is just one guy's opinion on a potentially huge play."
2021-06-14 11:39:14,wallstreetbets,$VUZI good company!
2021-06-14 11:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Made some money on them early in the year but sold after i did more research. My primary concern is eventually they need to have sales to back up the market cap and finviz says they only have \~$14M. still think its an interesting play especially for military and medical purposes but if someone else wins the contracts they are supposed to, it could be trouble."

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"You Can't Spell MOON Without ""MOO"" 🐄☁️ Why CLNE is a HUGE Buying Opportunity 🚀🚀🚀 **I’M LOSING ALL MY MONEY ON MEME STOCKS WHAT DO I DO?**



Chill, retard.  Go outside and get some sunlight for once, all this stressing in your wife’s boyfriend’s basement isn’t doing you any good.  Watching a ticker go up and down for 8 hours a day will make even the most sane apes go insane.   First and foremost, stonks don’t only go up (especially meme stocks).  There’s these things called fundamentals, and here’s why CLNE is actually a good company:


- The #1 company in U.S and Canada when it comes providing the cleanest fuel, Renewable Natural Gas (RNG)

- Biden all about going green in the future so helps to have the government on its side

- The average analyst predictions have the stock worth around $20, and plenty of room to grow

- Partnership with Amazon that includes delivering 1000 RNG powered vehicles to them, as well as them buying 53 million shares at a strike price of $13.49 by the end of the decade from CLNE.

- Other deals with major players such as BP, Total SE, and Chevron



**Why will RNG be the leading fuel for heavy transportation in the future?**



As stated, RNG is the cleanest fuel in the world.  If going by GWP, which stands for Global Warming Potential, it has a GWP of 1.1 and that’s technically carbon negative.  Note, the higher the GWP the worse it is for the environment.  The methane that’s created from landfills and treatment facilities comes in at a whopping 31 GWP, but that’s captured and turned into the natural gas all by yours truly.  For comparison, electric has a GWP of 10, and hydrogen has a GWP averaging around 6.  


Note: neither of these other competitions (electric and hydrogen) have the infrastructure going forward that RNG has.  Not to mention an electric truck would only be able to drive for around 4 hours before needing to be charged for 3 hours, whereas RNG takes about 8 minutes to fully fuel up.  




**So if it’s so undervalued, why is the price staying low?!?**



Well it’s high of $19.79 (which is a lot closer to its fair value than right now) was back in February but all of EV’s and green energy sold off back then and it never quite recovered due to no big news.  And the recent couple weeks haven’t been helping: 



[https://preview.redd.it/0w3ny5m0dw271.jpg?width=714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f](https://imgur.com/a/KoQCrnD) 



Notice how the average volume shorted is around 500k, and when the stock started going up starting 6/3 then it went into the MILLIONS?  And it’s not just the volume either, the actual % change or ratio shorted went from around 8% to 30%+!!!  On Wednesday 6/9 there were 43 MILLION SHARES SHORTED.  And on Thursday 6/10, 19,135,301 shares were shorted out of a total of 58,606,642 shares traded.  So roughly 1/3 of ALL the trades were just straight up short ladder attacks.  (Note it was 32.6% which is the highest it’s ever been this year).  Then Friday 6/11, the volume went down but another 4.5 million shares were shorted (which made up 24% of the volume that day) before they even covered the ones from Thursday.  



**I DON’T KNOW HOW TO READ WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN??**



Big players didn’t expect $CLNE to gain traction on WSB and made a bet that the price would stay stagnant while they profit off of selling options.  The shorts have doubled down.  Or in their case, quadrupled down.  As stated in my earlier DD, there’s a potential gamma ramp up that will send this stock to the 25+ if it sits above $13 on 6/18 because of the open interest on calls.  The amount of calls that will be IN THE MONEY is in the millions and only keeps going up.  This means that these big guys will lose BILLIONS of dollars, so they have to make sure that doesn’t happen by shorting the shit out of the stock.  Because CLNE has a smaller float, it’s pretty easy to manipulate as can be seen in the price action last week.  This means that the MAJORITY of shareholders ARE NOT SELLING and the price action is due to the millions of shares shorted.  They have 2 days to cover, and most start covering AH to not get fucked by calls and also reduce their chances of being pushed out.  Which of course explains why $CLNE starts spiking up as soon as the market closes.  Every damn time.  



**What does Cramer think of all this?**



That’s a stupid question, who cares what that old hag thinks.  It’s worth noting though that he came out on twitter last week to bash on the stock saying “Today's meme stock is Clean Energy Fuels. Be careful, while i have always liked the company b/c i favor nat gas for short and long haul, the company's had no real revenue growth and almost no profitability in a decade. There will be sellers.”  But then he interviewed 2 days later being very positive about the company and expecting lots of growth.  Anytime someone like him reverses his opinion so fast, makes me BULLISH as hell.  Also, the company is in more of a growth and research phase right now and could easily be profitable if they wanted to but choose to stay in this phase so that they can take over the whole game later.  



**So what’s the play?** 



Pretty easy.  Buy shares and hold.  The fact that this stock was at $15 after hours on Thursday shows the buying pressure is there and the people on the other side are scared.  It would’ve been an easy company to profit off of for them but unfortunately CLNE started trending on WSB and now some retarded apes are gonna make them pay.  



**TL;DR**   Read the damn DD if you want some wrinkles, it’s not long.  Basically the shorts have QUADRUPLED down and want to ride this into this week causing negative sentiment and therefore selling off.  It’s in the data.  The fact that this company is backed by actual fundamentals and reached 15 AH shows how undervalued it is currently.

2021-06-14 10:59:24,wallstreetbets,"**SHORTEST SUMMARY**: 

Due to climate concerns, heavy-haul transport trucks gotta switch fuel eventually. Places like ports in California are putting rules in place where you either show up in a renewable-powered vehicle OR get fined. 

What do they switch to? Not electric, the amount of batteries cuts down the amount of stuff you can carry, and the charge time is a lot of hours your truck isn’t moving or making money. Not hydrogen - the distribution network just isn’t there, and the vehicles themselves are mostly concept vehicles. Also, you can’t just convert an existing diesel-powered truck to either of these. 

They’re gonna go Natural Gas, and CLNE is best-positioned to sell it. You can convert your diesel-burner to a Natural Gas burner for a few hundred dollars. Natural gas sales & distribution exist *now*, not as a “would sure be neat if someone built that”."

A great summary. 

It's very hard to grasp just how sticky infrastructure and systems could be, and CLNE is the easy way out. 

An easy way to think about it is how Microsoft OS has managed to stick around for so long. If all the developers had to reconfigure/re-optimize all the applications, while several generations of users relearn how to use a new OS, use new Office applications like Excel, etc etc, it would be an absolute nightmare. It would also cost a fortune. Cheaper to stick with what already exists."

2021-06-14 18:43:35,wallstreetbets,"I'm still learning this myself.



But from what I learned so far, there's a call and a put.


A call is basically betting that something will reach a certain price (going up) and then when it does you are allowed to buy the stocks at that price. So it's kind of like locking in a price and then hoping it reaches that price so you can buy it. The benefit of doing this is that you only pay a premium if you decide to **not** buy them (if it doesn't hit your price or if you change your mind). As opposed to just buying a share where you have to buy them.


And a put is if it goes down.



Anyone is free to correct me because I'm still learning.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Best case for TSLA So, this isn’t financial advice. And I am long with some puts on TSLA. But despite TSLA’s ability to make money out of thin air, and the recent (banned e-currency word that I’ll refer to as “BUTTCOIN”) pump-and-dump that Elon is now trying to go for with round 2, here’s what has been banging around my crayon eating brain lately:

#earnings quality 

This seems like red flag numero uno for me. Tesla’s loses a ton of money making electric vehicles - and this has been in a climate where they have been the head-and-shoulders best electric car maker. What happens when Ford goes balls deep into EV’s in 12 months with an F-150 that can power a Texas rancher’s home for three days during the next hurricane (or power a full construction jobsite full of cordless tools and allow for contractors to ditch their noisy and expensive generators)?

TSLA makes its profits from two things, and both are unsustainable: BUTTCOIN and the sale of emissions credits. Emissions credits will dry up once other automakers get into electric vehicles (and TSLA will then face huge market share pressure form new electric vehicle entrants, further crimping sales and profits). And BUTTCOIN is speculative crap you can do on the side if you feel that strongly about BUTTCOIN. It just reeks of a FyreFest tech bro who is constantly scrounging for cash flow to try and pull off a vision.

#valuation

This stock still trades at more than 16 times sales and 600 times earnings. And the earnings quality and sustainability is crap. Grade A horseshit. (those earnings primarily comprise non-operating profits).

#dont take my word for it

Michael Burry, has placed an absolutely massive short bet on Tesla.

#operating market pressures

Chinese orders for Tesla vehicles were nearly cut in half last month. This comes as U.S.-China tensions ramp up. (China is the largest global market for electric vehicles, accounting for approximately one half of the global EV market. Thus, Tesla’s key growth engine appears to be revving down considerably.)

Also, the intense level of competition in the global EV market is heating up. Competitors are producing more EVs at better price points than Tesla. Their EVs offer technological improvements and product enhancements that close the rather large gap Tesla had in this regard not too long ago.

TLDR; TSLA trades at a 600 p/e, has NEVER made a profit form operations (only from carbon offsets and BUTTCOIN trading - which coincidentally make me unsure it ever should have been included in S&P 500, since inclusion criteria is one year of profits, and TSLA only gets
profits from fictitious accounting plays like emissions credits, or from rampant YOLO BUTTCOIN trades), and now that it will see a dry-up of its emissions credits and will see legit EV competition, I think this stock is going to sink like a stone. Price target < $300 by year end, < $100 by end of 2022. 

Just my thoughts, not advice. Do your own research."
2021-06-14 09:42:47,wallstreetbets,Have fun betting against Tesla! Worked really well for everyone in the past.
2021-06-14 09:52:46,wallstreetbets,Buttcoin lmao
2021-06-14 09:49:39,wallstreetbets,"Tesla stock isn't based on profit margins or p/e ratio

It's the original GME, people just like the stock.

Betting for or against Tesla is pure gambling because there is zero logic behind its market cap or how and why people will sell or buy it.

Add in Elon 'ADHD Karen' Musk and his unthinking followers and you have an absolute recipe for share price chaos.

There's no way I'd bet either way because there's no way to predict."
2021-06-14 09:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Aside from the fact that making cars actually makes Tesla money...

They're losing money because they are accelerating their growth at a rapid pace. When Berlin and Austin are done they'll make a lot more money and be spending less.

Also, saying that Ford's truck is going to be amazing is pretty shortsighted. Sure, they have the Mach E out there that they've made, what, 50k of? Ford lacks the experience that Tesla has, and they also produce a small fraction of the EVs that Tesla makes.

You go ahead and join Burry on the short side, and you may well make a lot of money. Long term, Tesla is the one to own, not Ford. Ford has proven they can make and sell a low volume EV. What they haven't proven is they can make something with real volume and sell it. And what is not yet known is what will happen to all of those Ford dealers when Ford goes full EV and those dealers say fuck you, we won't sell that shit for you because we make no money on it."
2021-06-14 09:49:46,wallstreetbets,"Just remember Mr. Burry first bought Puts in December... It is not hard to look at a chart and see that the chance he made money on that bet is pretty low. He might have bought more Puts later on and might have got the timing right on some, but don't get too excited about Mr. Burry here."
2021-06-14 09:41:40,wallstreetbets,automaking is a tough low margin business.
2021-06-14 17:07:19,wallstreetbets,"Tesla has another thing on it's side - Batteries and Electric Infra/tech. Tesla invests heavily in materials science - something the other car manufacturers don't. Tesla's charging infrastructure is incredibly better in terms of ease of use, speed and availability. 

They are also far ahead in long term research on advanced battery manufacturing - they have already secured lithium deposits and are working on reducing the amount of rare metals needed to produce batteries. I think once the emissions credits stop working they will end up selling batteries to the other manufacturers and still stay ahead."

2021-06-14 10:14:53,wallstreetbets,"Just to give the other side of the argument. Upcoming POSITIVE catalysts for Tesla:

1. Full Sell Drive Wide Beta (mid-2021) - 100% profitable and subscription based. 

2. Release of Cybertruck (end-2021/early-2022) - Over 1m in preorders, which would amount to over 50 B in revenue!

3. Robotaxis (2022-2023) - Although Tesla says they’ll have this service by the end of the year, Cathie Woods only gives them a 30% chance of releasing it in 2022. Again, another 100% profitable product. 

These three catalysts could easily amount to the stock doubling in a couple of years. Cathie Woods herself believes that the stock is worth 3,000 by 2025. It might experience up and downs until then, but the overall trajectory is up. 

Not financial advice."

Chinese orders dwindling turned out to be FUD. In reality Tesla gained like +29% sales in May. Many cars were exported from Shanghai. (Total Shanghai Factory cars sold in May = 33,463) 

Competitors are not making great EVs. Tesla is ahead of them in both quality and value for $. Tesla has over 90% of the EV market share and the EV market is only like 5% of the total car market. There is massive potential for everyone getting into the EV game. Tesla may lose some of the EV market share, But the the EV market as a whole is going to explode. Then factor in a $25,000 Tesla and a potential renewal of the $7500 tax credits for EVs..."

Are they going to make them out of thin air? Run them in magic tires that don't deteriorate? Make the self driving software with magical software engineer fairies?"
2021-06-14 11:16:20,wallstreetbets,"So yes, these are all valid. 

And I will be watching these. 

If Ford hadn’t gone BALLS DEEP into electric trucks and let the POTUS do a burnout in its new F150, I’d admit the cybertruck has a lot of appeal. The crazy body shape of it is actually a functional plus in my view - nearly impossible to dent. 

But with insane entries coming from Ford and Hummer and others, Tesla won’t be the only luxury EV/sport/rugged pickup truck option out there. (But maybe Ford is an old dog and tesla will be the thing that kicks it to the curb? I really don’t know.)

Ford seems to have finally gotten its head out of its ass and realizes going to bigger gas guzzling engines isn’t the future. So we are going to see Ford/Ferrari levels of competition between Tesla and Ford for EV truck dominance. 

As a pickup owner, I am already looking forward to decades of insanely gorgeous and amazing trucks to drive. This will absolutely happen. Regardless of whether I’m right or wrong on TSLA (and I’m long Ford with shares and LEAPS). 

Robotaxis could be the iPhone trillion-dollar category killer for TSLA as well.

I’m prepared to lose 100% of my put investment. I suppose it’s my form of gambling."

2021-06-14 10:20:58,wallstreetbets,"Great point on the R&D. F, GM, VW...not product innovation companies really. Ford's best product is the same product for decades (F150) and their latest hit is just a nostalgia piece (Bronco) , GM sees success and copy cats (looking at you, mid engine corvette), VW has some innovation in their luxury brands but the bread and butter is A to B comfortable commuter cars. They let Tesla test the market, develop designs and manufacturing processes that better suit EVs, etc. 

I think the next 5years for EV is going to be really exciting, but any success Tesla may see is quintessentially priced in. If I had bought TSLA 2 years ago I would be giddy and hold. If I had 100 shares I would be selling calls. The stock will be facing a lot of profit taking and bad press in the coming year if they can't stay ahead of the market and manufacture profitably."

2021-06-14 11:08:55,wallstreetbets,"This is the counter argument for sure. I think home batteries and solar is their only viable long term competitive edge (or maybe self-driving tech and AI). 

But that doesn’t justify a 600 P/E. 

And Elon Musk doesn’t strike me as a guy with a laser focus ethos (compared to Gates/Zuckerberg/Bezos/Jobs). He is all over the map - Boring company, Bitcoin, sending folks to Mars, hyperloop, rescuing kids trapped in caves, spending Trump-like hours on Twitter going back and forth with random Joes, solar, batteries, oh, and cars.

It’s just a diffuse hodgepodge of blue sky big emotionally appealing initiatives. And it sounds great. But once we get tot he part where he needs to be a profit-and-loss business man, where does that leave us? He is like the dot com bubble wrapped into one person and one company. Tons of cool ideas with no path to profits. 

Car manufacturing? It’s a 15-20 P/E effort at best. And if we do get self driving cars, holy smokes, total car ownership goes WAY DOWN compared to where we are today. Same if electric vehicles last longer than gas cars (which experts say they should). Same if self-driving cars don’t get totaled in crashes as frequently as regular cars are today. So I think total cars shrinks in 2040 compared to today in the US. 

Tech? He seems to flip flop on lidar/radar etc..I don’t know that Tesla’s self driving R&D is anything that Google and Apple and other competitors can’t replicate fairly easily. 

If he said “I’m all in on self-driving tech and AI” and he ditched the other stuff, then sure, maybe TSLA becomes a very different company. He could maybe dominate that and license it to every car maker (like Windows gets licensed to all the PC makers). But he’s trying to be Apple - vertically integrated hardware/software company that puts AI into cars that they manufacture and keep tight “right to repair” control over. (And Apple was a stinker at that until iPod/iPhone/iPad came along and became category killers - when Apple did that with regular PC’s pre iPod, it ran into lots of trouble and small market share.)

And Musk strikes me as not the guy you want running these very very different businesses. 

But I totally get it - the stock has gone to the moon, folks have made billions off of it, and folks on Reddit adore Musk. 

So I expect the hate and push back. Your take is probably far more popular than mine. I didn’t put this out here trying to change minds. 

I just put it out here as my observations - and I get it - they are probably worth a bag of shit."

Ford have this down, yet tesla do not. Tesla regularly score poorly in quality as a result.

Ford makes trucks. Millions of them. Sure, it’s a different drivetrain entirely to go EV. 

Sometimes first to market is a sustainable competitive advantage (Amazon) and other times it shows better companies what is possible (Myspace for Facebook and Xerox research labs and GUI/mouse for Apple and Microsoft, etc…). 

How did MySpace, AOL, Napster, Wang Labs, DEC, Kodak, etc..hold up once competition came along? Tech has a brutal reputation of being cutthroat."
2021-06-14 11:14:38,wallstreetbets,"Not really, everyone knows. 

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html

Michael Burry is long puts against 800,100 shares of Tesla or $534 million by the end of the first quarter, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

So he has 8001 puts for the price of $534 million. So his put prices were $667.  I think it's safe to assume those were quite far in the money for a long expiration.

For that price now you can get $1,200.00 puts expiring June 16 2023"
2021-06-14 11:29:10,wallstreetbets,"Why are you looking at P/E? If we pull out the EV business out of every company… it is likely that almost all are losing money, some in really big ways. Tesla likely has the highest margin of large scale efforts and highest operational efficiency and they don’t have a legacy business to deal with as well as unfunded pension obligations.

Tesla has been strongly cash flow positive from operations and EBITDA positive. For high growth rate, compare EBITDA as well as look at the enterprise value."
2021-06-14 11:09:15,wallstreetbets,"I mean, they do look nice! Lol"
2021-06-14 17:02:56,wallstreetbets,"Again, if they are missing critical parts like battery cells, they cannot make vehicles.

Ford is talking about 240 GWh of cell supply by 2030. Tesla is talking about that for 2023. That’s  around 2.5 million cars worth.

Look at the components of major cost of goods of a long range BEV. The BEV specific components and advanced electronics are more than 50% of the cost of the vehicle. Tesla has significant leads on those parts.

Made in China Model 3 has highest quality:

https://insideevs.com/news/437594/tesla-model-3-made-in-china-quality/"
2021-06-14 13:22:46,wallstreetbets,"Tesla recommends a $200 preventive visit every 6 years. Otherwise just tires, wiper blades and wiper fluid as needed. 
The 200 bucks gets you a new cabin air filter, coolant check and a few other small things. Magnetic braking means the brakes can last the life of the car, and there are a ton of expensive systems EVs just don't have."
2021-06-14 12:05:24,wallstreetbets,"""As of March 31, Burry owned 8,001 put contracts, with unknown value, strike price, or expiry, according to the filing.""

Did he buy them in Dec or in March?

In any case... If you look at Jan 2023 the $1,000P was about $500 and at no time was it much above that. If he opened the position in Dec he might have paid more. He could have lucked out and bought those for about $450 in Feb.

If you look at the $1,200P for Jan 2023 similar story.

The $1,200 put for Jun 2023 was first sold in May 2021 so not that. In any case that Put would have been hard to profit on so far.

Looking at the June 2022 $1,000P similar story. If you bought in Dec you probably lost money. If you bought in Feb you might have made (if you sold).

I can look at others, just is very hard to know... If anything this illustrates the difficulty with making money on options, especially puts."
2021-06-14 11:35:14,wallstreetbets,This is a good point. EBITDA is probably a better metric. I’ll see how they do on that front over the coming year as Ford enters the market.
2021-06-14 13:01:46,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, but if it's the case that Tesla indeed does go down as much as he thinks it will, he'll be in big profit.

I can easily see it happen, just have to question if it happens in the next year and a half."
2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WISH Coming True Just rehashing the points from last week

- Expected revenue for 2021- $3.25 billion. 
- Cash on balance sheet- approx. $2 billion.
- Revenue increased 75% compared to last year.
- WISH is also most downloaded e-commerce app in the world for last 3 years.
- In 2015, Amazon had offered $10 billion in cash but WISH walked away.
- Current Enterprise Value = $6 billion (Market cap.) - Cash (2 billion) = $4 billion
- Currently trading at 1.9 times expected 2021 revenues. With industry average of 4.5 times revenue, WISH is trading far below with industry average. 

Wish is one of the largest and fastest growing global ecommerce platforms and even assuming 4.5 times, it should be trading at $24.

In addition, with economies reopening it will be easy to facilitate shipping and will favourably impact WISH. In addition, low income group which were adversely impacted will be back.

Moreover company is diversifying out of China and partnering with local stores to drive product sales. The company already has more than 50,000 local stores in 50 countries (like Brazil and Mexico and other Latin America and Europe) and company is planning to expand in Africa. This will continue growth in new markets to drive more revenues.

As you can see there are lot of tail winds for this stock and it can easily muti-bagger at this dirt cheap price. 

You don’t make money without patience. Just buy and hold and let compounding do it’s magic.

WISH went through several rounds of raising capital through equity financing with company valuation way north of $10 billion. As a result, early investors are not going to sell at this level."

1) The rally today, if it holds and does not turn into a massive sell-off, should *finally* disprove the June 14 lock-up expiry conspiracy theory that's been circulating around here. 

2) It helps to be less US-centric when looking at Wish. It generates less than half of its revenues from North America, and the geographies with the biggest potential are probably emerging markets. Consumer expectations regarding branding, quality and customer service are not the same as ours."

#ContextLogic Up 15% on Partnership With PrestaShop

Last updated Jun 14,2021, 1:57 PM

By Josh Beckerman

Shares of ContextLogic Inc., the e-commerce company
that operates as Wish, rose 15%, to $11.47, as the
company announced a two-year partnership with
PrestaShop.

Volume was more than 155 million shares, compared
with a 65-day average of 20.1 million.

More than 300,000 merchants and brands on the
PrestaShop platform will be able to sell to customers on
the Wish marketplace."

2021-06-14 17:02:51,wallstreetbets,I'm with you! 835 shares in today!
2021-06-14 11:12:07,wallstreetbets,It has a great potential. Next Amazon or Alibaba?
2021-06-14 12:06:26,wallstreetbets,I dont know how it is now but Wish was a scam back when I tried it out. Its market was literally clickbait with cool pics and dirt cheap prices but the products were less than useable. I saw unboxing vid reviews back in the day and wanted to try it out. It was as bad as they say it was. Its great for buying cheap items but if you see something that’s too good to be true (i.e. something priced far less than its valued) then don’t buy it.
2021-06-14 12:41:53,wallstreetbets,"I disagree

\- 87% of their suppliers are based in China = high risk to geopolitical issues + will never meet shipping expectations set by amazon amoung others. Thus, Wish doesn’t operate within much of an economic moat given it doesn’t have protected access to any of its manufacturers. This is troublesome given its core value proposition is price, which becomes unsustainable if manufacturing and supply chains are less embedded in the value chain

&#x200B;

\-Also over the past 4 years their sales and marketing expenses averaged 81% of revenue and 104% of gross profit. Meaning that currently, every $1 spent on marketing returns $1.23 in revenue but only $0.96 in gross profit. This is significantly lower than comparables (Amazon does >$4.30 in revenue for every $1 in marketing), signaling a potential reliance on inorganic growth strategies that are 1) difficult to scale and 2) likely EPS dilutive given current valuations of relevant targets, which is why they are trading at a discount"

CRSR and WISH are definitely stocks that belong into r/investing and r/stocks as well. They're great plays for the long-term, but will probably run significantly in the short-term as well."

2021-06-14 13:26:19,wallstreetbets,"Don't let the FOMO take over. This is another pump-and-dump where the ones who got in early will exit once others are on the bandwagon.

What else was pumped and dumped on WSB?

BlackBerry (lots of bagholders still hanging out around here)

Nokia... pumped from $4.50 to $9.00, then back down to $4.00 for months, now recovering based on fundamentals to about $5.50.

Rocket Companies... pumped from $20 to $44... now hovering around $20 or less.

ContextLogic ($WISH) is dumped by insiders as soon as the acquire stock. I wouldn't trust them."
2021-06-14 10:07:01,wallstreetbets,Asking the real questions
2021-06-14 10:17:23,wallstreetbets,"Likely similar to what has/is occurring with $GME and $AMC, funds attacking it to keep price suppressed until they can cover the (last I had heard) 48-51% shorted float.

Edit: I’m holding 10x 7/16 10c, and I’m not worried."
2021-06-14 10:29:31,wallstreetbets,That large spike in the beginning then settling is day traders trading the popular Reddit stocks. That’s why you had a huge pump and then a big sell off. Guys trying to make a quick buck but the. The real investors come in after to buy lower prices after day traders pull out.
2021-06-14 18:07:16,wallstreetbets,"137 days old as well... I spotted a trend, now time for some technical analysis"
2021-06-14 13:28:14,wallstreetbets,Don't do it. You'll probably lose money unless the pump continues...
2021-06-14 18:10:31,wallstreetbets,"139 days old,  u/-doobs, plus they all have seven-ish upvotes"
2021-06-14 13:16:29,wallstreetbets,"You will get a bunch of downvotes because the people on here just want to promote the stock they invested in, but you are also 100% correct. Most of these guys just bought Wish stock without having ever tried to buy stuff from it. 

If you look in the electronics section on wish almost everything looks like scam.  Imagine if you bought something off of Amazon and the pictures you saw on Amazon were not the product but just photoshopped pictures.  You would ask for your money back, I’ve had to do this with everything I have bought off of wish so far... to their credit they are pretty good about returning funds after you buy a scam product. 

Also, you can’t even browse the wish products without signing up for an account.  This is artificially increasing their user base as people need to create an account just to look at the products, but then they will become so disgusted by having to login just to look at crappy products that they will end up deleting the app and blocking them after the 15th day in a row of getting spam in their emails.  

Also, wish is currently being sued for providing false information about their sales and user numbers. 

Now, I also own wish stock, because when I see a stock previously priced over $30 and then it is under $10 I do a complex “analysis” (10<30) and buy the undervalued stock. I hope you guys cause it to blow up. And then I hope you all sell the stuff immediately because it is a garbage company. If you think otherwise cancel your Amazon account and try ordering everything from wish, give it about a week and if you haven’t gone insane come back on here and tell us how you feel about it"
2021-06-14 12:46:21,wallstreetbets,That said I suppose most of you are looking for ST gains from a squeeze
2021-06-14 13:30:17,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it's suspect! Pump and dumpers are here."
2021-06-14 18:42:31,wallstreetbets,yes 👍

2021-06-14 17:48:03,wallstreetbets,And your point is ? It moved up 13% today. So what’s your logic ?
2021-06-14 10:44:19,wallstreetbets,It’s more expensive and there’s a chance something will go terribly wrong and you lose all your money over night. Risk reward. If you’re feeling confident than by all means

2021-06-14 17:52:27,wallstreetbets,"Please. Wish & Amc were the only green meme stocks today. This morning wish had like 5.4 million shares available to short now 7.8 million available. But I’m sure the news played no part in that. I’m sure it’s just coincidence that the stock was flat pre market then bounced 5% instantly when the news dropped & the stock closed up 12% just because. Extremely bullish news. FB & PINS exploded last summer just weeks after they announced their partnership with Shopify. This opens up new merchants, products, & revenue. Especially the Landing page, that to me is awesome for wish"

2021-06-14 13:19:36,wallstreetbets,"100% it is this.  I think very few of these guys have used wish.com. It is not a good site, but the stock has “squeeze potential” so good luck convincing these guys not to love it"
2021-06-14 18:13:35,wallstreetbets,"why get mad if your tactics are working? have anything to lose? your fakes are all made in the same week and pushing wish up the ass in recent posts. you even went and bought yourself some awards, how nice

also this sub is no place for logic.. you can take that back to your HF"
2021-06-14 10:48:04,wallstreetbets,"Seems higher risk with weeklys though because you're betting all or nothing on a sudden spike.

2021-06-14 10:29:48,wallstreetbets,"Awesome news, thanks! I ended up buying 600 shares at $10.17, i'm along for the ride boss!"
2021-06-14 10:15:49,wallstreetbets,Wish Announces Partnership With Leading Ecommerce Platform PrestaShop
2021-06-14 12:57:05,wallstreetbets,"I'm not smart enough to give you advice in regards to options, unfortunately, but I'm sure some people are.

Right now, you've sold 5 calls with a strike of 12.5. Which means if they get exercised you have to sell the holder 100 shares per contract for 12.5 each.

So at a cost basis of 10.2 that means you will make 1.150 if you get exercised (and you obviously got some premium for selling the calls).

Whether to buy back or not probably depends on how much it would cost you and how confident you are on the price of WISH rising much higher than 12.5.

If you expect the price to rise to - say - 20 fast, buying them back is probably gonna be a good idea since you'd make 4.900 as opposed 1.150 if you were able to sell the shares at 20.

However, if you expect the price to just barely scrape/surpass 12.50, it might not be worth buying back."
2021-06-14 13:27:20,wallstreetbets,True! Look how many of these fake accounts are pumping right now...
2021-06-14 18:17:10,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-14 10:52:14,wallstreetbets,"True, but you also pay a higher premium so if the option expires you end up losing more money."
2021-06-14 17:32:42,wallstreetbets,oh I thought you were a bot
2021-06-14 13:05:51,wallstreetbets,"Me retard too. I barely understand, so I'm kinda doing this to learn by doing. 

If I get called out, 12.5 - 10.2 is 2.3? Plus you're right, the premium was .55. So 2.85 max gain?

I'm not real bullish on this stock. I think the Amazon news is priced in. But I'm gonna be really happy for you all if I'm wrong and not too sad for myself. I just won't do this again.

Thank you"
2021-06-14 18:34:20,wallstreetbets,"not butt hurt about anything because i only invest money that i give 0 fucks about. youre trying to channel that 0 fuckery into something you give a fuck about, a cardinal sin. also your accounts awarded each other lol. that badge flair really gets those suckers, huh?

in all honesty, no hard feelings. this is (probably) a free country, so do what you want. but ill do what I want so if you're gonna make fakes you'll have to try harder to fool retards like me"
2021-06-14 10:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I get that. 

I guess I only buy options when I'm very confident or if they're at a huge discount due to low IV and being oversold. 

Strictly speaking about bullish stocks. I dont even bother shorting or being bearish especially given the climate of destroying the shorts."
2021-06-14 18:02:11,wallstreetbets,yeah my profile def looks like a bot's
2021-06-14 13:12:13,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, don't be sad for yourself. If the stock goes up and you get exercised, you still will have made well over 1k on an investment of just over 5k. That's a quick 20% gain, which is still amazing!

So even if it happens, it's much better than the price going down (which would leave you with the premium but also the shares you don't believe in that much). And it's no reason to quit - you'll just have gained experience for the next time."
2021-06-14 18:46:50,wallstreetbets,"Dude, wtf are you talking about ? Why would I award myself ?"
2021-06-14 10:55:37,wallstreetbets,True that. I bought some WISH calls last week at 12.50 and almost immediately they lost a huge percentage of equity. It can be pretty demoralizing but here’s hoping WISH continues to roll train
2021-06-14 13:16:21,wallstreetbets,"Oh yea, by not do this again, I mean sell covered calls on a stock that's gonna moon. I will absolutely go full retard ape on any stock in the top three ticker mentions of this sub. That's how I pick em. Still working out the strategy. Can't just buy and hold. Lose too much."
2021-06-14 10:58:48,wallstreetbets,"You should consider doing covered call spreads 

I have two profitable WISH spreads

7/16 10c buy to open and 20c sell to open

And 10/15 12.5c buy to open and 17.5c sell to open

This greatly mitigates risk but of course caps your potential profit if it exceeds the higher target. 

But I'd rather guarantee consistent profits. 

They rarely go against me without being able to sell to close for a profit early"

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CRSR DD Part 2 or why Corsair will swallow the gaming industry and be a 'millionaire maker' stock Sup apes. In my first [DD last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxhh7d/crsr_dd_or_why_you_should_park_all_your_cash_in/), I gave a short rundown of why Corsair is incredibly undervalued, and how it should be in **everyone’s portfolio**. With Part 2, I’m addressing a lot of the comments I got as well as going a bit deeper into how Corsair will make this industry their bitch and reach ATH in 2021.  

-


**Why is Corsair in a strong position to leverage the gaming and streaming industry?**
-
Corsair didn’t snooze, but rather spend the last years hunting for good companies to acquire. Being well funded, profitable and raking in cash every year allowed them to expand in all directions with a core focus on the fastest growing niche: Streaming. Have a look at their investor relations page:

-

*“Corsair is a leading global provider and innovator of high-performance gear for gamers and content creators. Our industry-leading gaming gear helps digital athletes, from casual gamers to committed professionals, to perform at their peak across PC or console platforms, and our streaming gear enables creators to produce studio-quality content to share with friends or to broadcast to millions of fans.* 

*CORSAIR also includes subsidiary brands Elgato, which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators, SCUF Gaming, which builds custom-designed controllers for competitive gamers, and **ORIGIN PC**, a builder of custom gaming and workstation desktop PCs and laptops.**

-
With Elgato they positioned themselves years ago already to capitalize on one of the fastest growing entertainment subsegments (Streaming). While acquiring SCUF Gaming and ORIGIN PC allowed them to also expand and play in the console market as well as Pre Build PCs and laptops. **They basically moved up the ladder from RGB fans, keyboards, RAM sticks and Cases to EVERYTHING you need to play, stream or game properly.**

**How much faster is Corsair really expanding?**
-

I cannot stress this enough, but their last quarter results really blew it completely out of the water. Seeing how they raised guidance, I think August will be even more brutal. One for value:

* **$529.4 million** in net revenue, an increase of **71.6%** year-over-year. 
* **$175.9 million** net revenue for Gamer and creator peripherals segment, an increase of **131.9%** year-over-year.
* Gross profit was **$160.3 million**, an increase of **103.9%** year-over-year, with a gross margin of 30.3%, an improvement of 480 basis points year-over-year. 
* Operating income was **$67.3 million**, an increase of **404.5%** year-over-year.
* Adjusted operating income was **$80.4 million**, an increase of **221.4%** year-over-year.


-
Do yourself a favor and whip up a site like FinViz, punch in your favorite meme stock and have a look at their revenue number vs market cap. There’s a reason why GME got picked up by DFV. Sales is still king and undervalued companies with aggressive growth have insane potential short and long term.

-
**Why hasn’t it blown up yet to +100?**
-

There is a good amount of chatter about two things. One being market manipulation, the other is that there is very little retail investor interest, compared to the amount of net sellers. The second point actually holds up, the stock never really got picked up by retail investors (or apes) and a lot of the commenters that did buy it up, mentioned how they were perfectly content with amassing shares every month while the price is still low. Pure but selfish value investing. 

-
**Eagle What?**
-

This one was also pointed out a lot. Corsair is owned by a private equity firm called EagleTree. They purchased the majority stake back in 2017 (which in turn allowed Corsair to expand much more aggressively) and now is obligated to reduce their share position over the next years until they only hold 10% of the company. 

They currently hold 61.9%. The shares sold are mostly picked up by **Vanguard**, **Blackrock** and a few other small institutions, plus retail of course. Looking at insider transactions we can see that EagleTree usually sells shares twice a year with the last transaction happening **June 3rd 2021**. 

This point doesn’t concern me too much personally, as it’s normal for private equity firms to reduce their stake after IPOs and Corsair is barely dipping $2 even with EagleTree selling 5 million shares. Now having sold their shares just now, it will probably be quiet for the next 6 months. 

-
**Back to 2021 and how you can make money**
-

They have a strong customer base which they've built up over the last 20 years, and thought f+ck it, let’s go all in on this market. Tits and streaming? Amazing! Controllers for consoles? Let’s do it. RGB Spinners on your lambo? Fuuckyea.

-

Instead of focusing on boring office peripherals that every Chinese company provides, they instead decided to slap RGB on everything and are loved for it. 

-

**Now EagleTree is gonna continue doing what eagles do, and we will continue doing what apes do. I’ll continue buying this company and watching their ER like a hawk while analysts jack themselves off over the sort of numbers Corsair hits out every quarter.**

-
I said it once, and I’ll say it again. If you don’t hold Corsair shares, you are pretty retarded. But since that’s half the sub already, just do your wife’s boyfriend a favour and pick up some shares while they are still dirt cheap. He will thank you for it once they hit **$70** or even blow through the stratosphere with **+$100.**

-

**TL:DR**

Corsair CEO Smart. Put this in your boomer dad’s portfolio (shares) and If you like gambling, buy some calls. 

-

Position: 100 shares at $33 and 12x 40$ Nov Calls. (yes I’m poor, and you can do better)."
2021-06-14 09:05:30,wallstreetbets,Glad I didn't drop my bags. Patience pays where there is conviction.

2021-06-14 10:05:15,wallstreetbets,Definitely still worth getting into. Even after strong open its undervalued massively.
2021-06-14 09:48:02,wallstreetbets,Love how DD like this comes after a 30% pre market move
2021-06-14 09:30:57,wallstreetbets,"God dammit, I read some DD on this over the weekend that confirmed my confirmation bias and I was going to add to my 55 shares and of course it rockets this morning."
2021-06-14 15:54:18,wallstreetbets,Corsair is easily one of the most underrated and undervalued stocks right now. It's actually crazy how this company isn't above 50 at least.
2021-06-14 08:59:54,wallstreetbets,Thought I had missed out on this when it shot up to $50 earlier in the year but I bought 300 shares once it dropped down to $32 (I sold cash covered puts that got exercised)

2021-06-14 09:41:37,wallstreetbets,This stock is worth at least $70!
2021-06-14 11:12:23,wallstreetbets,"Please give at least a time for the PT. This company based on fundamentals alone and based on Logitech’s valuation history (went through similar growth in the same industry), the stock should be about $50-$55 based on float and market cap. Therefore CRSR can easily pop to this number any day. But a $70 or $100 pt means that crsr will have to nearly 1.5x-2x its revenue and sales. I don’t think that will happen in the next few months. Will probably take 2 years. 

You also have to take into consideration the dumps this will have along the way. Literally it dumped this morning because everyone who has been consolidating the past few months (mainly options) made fucking bank this morning. (My august 40c were 9x this morning and my Jan 2021 calls were 3x). To get to 70 or 100 we need consistent buying pressure but right now the market is all about the next meme stock. Crsr might go to 50 by EOW but it will fizzle out once Reddit moves to the next stock. (Look at BB. If it held its volume and buying pressure last week we should’ve went to 25-30 but Everyone jumped on CLOV instead; the same thing may very well happen to CRSR too)

Of course buy the stock and hold long term if you want because I also believe crsr has tremendous growth. Idk about $100 but $70 seems to be realistic within 1-2 years."

2021-06-14 13:04:12,wallstreetbets,"I can't speak well to the stock, but as a company, I've been very happy with their progress over the past decade. They went from being a pretty consistent budget option to being one of the best options around for memory. They've segued into peripherals very easily, and seem to be following the same pattern. They made a lot of cheap but reliable products, and then moved into the high end of quality. They are rarely the biggest brand name for any product, but it's even rarer they're a bad choice.

As to the stock itself, it's sitting at a P/E of 24, which puts them on par with Logitech, above MSI, and under people like AMD. I'm not sure there's a great case for them being incorrectly valued to a large degree in either direction. If I were to invest in Corsair, it would have to be a long-term investment, because I believed in their ability to continue expanding and improving. They are still a growth investment in that respect. I would definitely not be buying short-term moonshot call options."

2021-06-14 15:30:39,wallstreetbets,"Their product line is diverse and of high quality. As someone in the gaming industry for years as a builder and consumer, they only make their position stronger over time. They’re stepping to the forefront now with custom liquid cooling (which isn’t great profitability, but earns street cred with the gaming community) and the loop parts are well-manufactured (even if rebranded, their QA is better than many manufacturers).

They do rebrand their RAM, PSUs, etc., but customer service, RMA, QA, and the designs for products they don’t rebrand (cases for instance) are quite strong.

I’d be long on CRSR if I wasn’t so deeply invested in AMC/GME and hedging my other long plays for when the market crashes after the squeezening and also migrating some of my capital into crypto that earns interest.

They have solid financials and they’re a leader in their sector. They care about the gaming community and their support therein has kept them a leader for close to 20 years now (or at least since around the time I started building computers in 2006)."
2021-06-14 17:28:49,wallstreetbets,"Ngl, if you think long-term, CRSR would even be undervalued at 50 bucks. Fair value in 3-5 years time for this is probably 85-115 bucks.

If it had the kind of support GME and AMC have, it would reach 150-200 bucks. And it might even stay quite high afterwards."

2021-06-14 10:10:31,wallstreetbets,"But wait there's more: You forgot a crucial element: Corsair recently acquired an Esports coaching service called GamerSensei. While their current revenue is around $2.5M, this is no doubt going to grow, considering the rise in interest in Esport all around the world. Not only has GamerSensei had a website overhaul, and a restructuring of their coaching, and potentially a lot more to come with potential future cash injections. GamerSensei is already industry-leading in terms of Esports coaching, but they also have incredible growth potential"
2021-06-14 09:08:28,wallstreetbets,"Every time i see a crsr post it just talks some generic ""oh why it should be this or that"" and provides some basic info from their financials.
If we have learned anything from past few months is that market don't give a shit about what ""should be"" or what ""the facts are"". The only thing that hat matters: 

1. Is there a demand for the stock to go up

2. Is there a fatalist that could make the stock go up.

Market could care less about your market shares and costs and volumes and revenues and current stock price. It really could care less if negative care would be possible, but it ain't so it doesn't so it doesn't care.

2021-06-14 09:46:40,wallstreetbets,"While I personally believe CRSR is an excellent company, as a PC enthusiast, the quality of these past two DD's have had misleading representations. I'm not going to disagree with any financials, as their balance sheet is very strong and can be viewed anywhere online. Here are a few of my gripes:

&#x200B;

>There is a good amount of chatter about two things. One being market manipulation

Why, dear why, does everything that doesn't skyrocket get pinned as ""market manipulation""? I realize you posted a second potential reason, but the first seems to be a common cop-out for not knowing what is actually happening. Similar to UFO's. Frequently, if somebody sees an *unidentified* flying object, their first response is ""welp, must be aliens!"" No Kathy, you've acknowledged that this anomaly is *unidentified*, your argument ends there. Do you have any source for this alleged market manipulation?

&#x200B;

Nothing else in this post per se irks me, as I'd love to have some RGB spinners on my Lambo.

(Timmy Tuner's Dad) IF I HAD ONE! (/Timmy Turner's Dad)

&#x200B;

I'll reference back though

From Post numero uno:

&#x200B;

>Their current market cap stands at 3.12B on 1.92B sales and 148m profit.

&#x200B;

This is not a gripe. If people should be convinced, this is one of the major reasons. The profit is fucking impressive.

&#x200B;

>**3.Cheap Options**  
>  
>Flat movement for the last months meaning LOW IV and CHEAP option prices. $40 Calls on November are $2. And long term leaps at $50 barely cost $1.40. Since inception last year, their shares went from $15 to $54 in the span of a couple months. This rally died off when people finally decided to take profits after the IPO. But if options are too rich for you, it's still an excellent time to buy shares and park your cash there while the run up to $50 happens.  
>  
>**4.Low Risk**

&#x200B;

I included the Low Risk heading in here for a reason. Promoting how healthy this company is and how safe an investment it is while simultaneously promoting options is ludicrous. I know this is WSB, I know. However, options are ***not*** a safe investment. They're inherently risky and thus come with greater rewards. Deep ITM calls are much more safe, as long as you're exercising, but let's be real, WSB thrives on those cheap FDs. If we look at CRSRs activity over the past several months (excluding today. I know it's up a lot) it's just been sideways trading. Which is to be expected, because of it's low IV!  If you buy some slightly OTM calls and hold them until expiry, your investment goes to zero if the stock hardly moves. Even if it moves slightly higher, these will be crushed by Theta decay. Poof! Whereas if you would have put the same amount into stocks, you'd still be holding the equity and might even be in the green!

&#x200B;

Again, not to say the options weren't cheap, or that your reasoning wasn't accurate, but promoting options as low risk isn't the best way to get your point across. High risk, high reward."

2021-06-14 19:56:58,wallstreetbets,"You have more information on EagleTree's 61.9% holdings?

Where can we monitor update of their holdings? They sold $160M worth today. If they caught $40, that would be 4M shs they dumped today.

https://www.globallegalchronicle.com/corsair-gamings-160-million-shares-offering/

They don't show up on Institutional Investors on sites I'm looking at. Are their 61.9% holdings part of the 92.19M shs outstanding or do they have shares not part of this count?

This large block of shares might not concern you but it seems like any time there's big upside, they can come in a dump until the have the holding size they want.

They might even have been responsible for pumping it up into their dump.

More color on their holdings would be appreciated."
2021-06-14 09:30:58,wallstreetbets,Are GME and CRSR not practically contenders in the coming years?
2021-06-14 10:02:52,wallstreetbets,"Lol, and I sold a big chunk early last year for a small loss. Now I look and its up 30%, paperhands have a 80% chance of fisting your anus guys, never forget"

2021-06-14 16:43:28,wallstreetbets,"Corsair has two problems:

1. The market thinks its direct competitor, Logitech, is a much better company
2. It is a prime shorting candidate to play the chip shortage game. Last earning, Corsair blamed chip shortage for not being able to meet gamer demand.

2021-06-14 12:44:18,wallstreetbets,"Here’s my questions for ya sir, I’m not a hater just undecided.

I’ve purchased almost every Corsair product you can (basically one per category).

I currently use their aio in my pc.

They have a ton of competition.  They did well during pandemic, but imo the only products they have that are actually amazing are: top tier ram sticks and sfx power supplies.

The rest of their products are imo mid-upper grade but not best in class.

When they went public, what was the purpose of the capital raise ?  How do they intend (strategy) to continue growing at that rate?

Historically multiples for companies like Corsair just aren’t very high, since they aren’t an actual tech/software company.

And their software is garbage, like razer software levels of garbage.  Like it is basically malware."
2021-06-14 12:50:22,wallstreetbets,I feel like I may have influenced this by commenting about Elgato on your last DD :D

2021-06-14 13:08:25,wallstreetbets,"I'd rather own NewEgg $NEGG. 97% of the stock is ownership, which leaves it a super low float, which means the price can get squeezed to the Fing moon a la Volkswagen. So soon as Options open up, it's gonna be Candyland."

2021-06-14 14:04:21,wallstreetbets,"To your second point about low retail interest: I honestly invested in a lot of the things I just believe in as products, early on. I picked up NVidia, for example. Never, ever, not even once, did I think to myself, ""oh yeah, the guys who made my computer case.""

And yet I know they are a backbone player in the buildapc communities. Weird, really."

2021-06-14 19:38:14,wallstreetbets,"Corsair has been super aggressive in the past few years to be top on brand recognition, and have set themselves apart as the go to guaranteed high quality brand that delivers what gamers are generally looking for. Only problem is their work with origin, where frankly Origin is specialized as the worst value PC someone can buy in today’s market. I think what could really see this company worth a fuck ton is if they aggressively took hold of origin and made a larger range for real budget PCs. 

Mix Corsair with Origins quality recognition and actual affordability of the products origin puts out and Corsair will be the number one gaming company no question."
2021-06-14 11:27:02,wallstreetbets,Spelled GME wrong
2021-06-14 11:28:40,wallstreetbets,"You lost me immediately at ""Sup Apes"""
2021-06-14 18:58:38,wallstreetbets,"Real talk. 

The sectors that Corsair competes in and gets the vast majority of its revenue from are low-margin, commoditised products like memory and PSUs where everyone just rebrands Micron/Samsung/Superflower products. The only small advantage they have here is the brand, sustained by massive marketing spend. All of the acquisitions they've done are tiny and don't shift the needle on the bottom line. Elgato is probably the best business they have but that's tiny.

Look through the financial statements going through history, and you'll notice that historic gross margins have stayed around 20%,and net income margins float around 0%. In 2020, net income margins were 6.1%. All of that increase (and more) can be attributed to the  700bp increase in gross margin. They have no operating leverage whatsoever. 

The key to this investment is whether that increase sticks around - not the PE firm, or meme potential, or growth of the wider gaming industry. If all of those go right, but gross margins go back to historic means, CRSR WILL NOT PRINT FCF.

My view of the gaming market is that the past year has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for component makers like CRSR. The demand was so high that they could gouge prices and increase margins, but that's not going to stick around forever. I haven't seen a compelling argument for gross margins continuing to stay where they are.

Arguments like Elgato having higher margins, or debt all being paid off in the future simply don't have big enough impacts to alter the fact that gross margin is the linchpin."
2021-06-14 09:10:47,wallstreetbets,"As a gamer I can say that Corsair gear is subpar to any other brand of gaming gear.

2021-06-14 09:51:12,wallstreetbets,"Corsair is a pretty impressive company at first sight but tbh their peripherals are some of the worst on the market. I bought one of their more expensive keyboards, really like it at first. I ended up buying a bunch of other peripherals because they seemed to work better when I’m a shared ecosystem. Everything Corsair product I’ve owned has failed in less than 6 months. All the RGB lighting of their products start to break down after a month or two. It’s great to be able to modify all of your peripherals from one program but that program is lackluster and buggy as hell. 

They advertise themselves as a more “mature” Company but they’re honestly no better than the competitors. They’re a big name in the industry but they aren’t actually all that good at what they do. They might be a good short-mid term investment but they really need to step things up if they want to be a real long term play."

2021-06-14 15:52:24,wallstreetbets,"Just a regular retail guy here and YMMV, but as a dad gamer, I couldn’t understand why their mouse wouldn’t come out of the box ready to use. I get the idea of having every button macro-able, but at least the 1-12 keys should function as such. Unless your customers are seeking that function out, it makes no sense. 

I did go with their mouse because of the sharp look and I rbg everywhere, but was dissatisfied that even though I did set up the macros and buttons, they will randomly stop functioning. Switched off to my Razer (not a huge fan but gets the job done) and haven’t looked back. 

Good DD tho and I could definitely see it taking off."

2021-06-14 14:20:02,wallstreetbets,"Corsair will not take over the gaming industry its a mid level quality producer that does not make a graphics card and the hardware it creates though good is not industry leading.

It's CPU coolers no longer even rate in the top 10. It's ram sets while still respectable do not lead the marker.

It's audio hardware:- headphones ware way to heavy and feel like you have a cement block on top of your head. The ear pieces are not ergonomic and cause discomfort  during long play sessions. They are no where near the standards of Razer, Steel Series, JBL, turtle beach etc.. or Logitech. Their gamer gear is substandard. Their ICUE app which is their operating system is horrible clunky and constancy has hardware conflicts with  with windows 10 in a number of areas and never runs 100% like a 1970's Volkswagen.

Hardware peripherals are ok but its audio hardware and peripherals suck to high heaven.

as for streaming there are dozens of apps that do it quite well and do not cause OS conflicts like corsair does.

The only ES sports gaming schools you should be paying attention too is Korea,China and Japan.

2021-06-14 09:53:33,wallstreetbets,I took an uberX last month and the driver said he was a stock broker. He said I should buy CRSR so I pulled out my phone and bought 50 shares. We was shocked. I was like…. Didn’t you you just tell me to do that?
2021-06-14 12:22:10,wallstreetbets,Have you used their raven claw mouse? It sucks ass. Low quality. Mine broke two different ways within a year. Good luck
2021-06-14 19:01:41,wallstreetbets,Psssshh this is not a meme stock. CRSR should not and will not 5X this year. Nobody talked about this stock for the past 6 months on its slow climb and now that it got a little pump and some recognition everyone wants to talk about how it’s going to be the next big thing...no it’s not. But that being said it has a decent price target and I personally am hoping for it to have a support of $40 by August.
2021-06-14 08:59:29,wallstreetbets,I think gamestop currently has way more growth potential in the gaming industry

Granted I don’t think CRSR is a meme stock, but hyping it up after it’s temporarily turned into one is sus.

2021-06-14 15:04:10,wallstreetbets,Dfv is in so count me in
2021-06-14 16:31:55,wallstreetbets,"This DD is good if you're looking to know about why Corsair is a good company now, but it doesn't say much about what might make it a better company in the future.

The fact is that Corsair is deeply entrenched in the gamer PC and peripherals industry is may dwindle to nothing as streaming technology gets better and better. We already have things like GeForce NOW, Stadia, and Microsoft's long term plan for Xbox seems to be to become a full-fledged ""Netflix of video games"" type of streaming service by continuing to beef up Game Pass.

So over the next 10 years we may see almost all gaming hardware (besides mobile devices and some other peripherals) move to data centers instead of being in people's homes, and companies like Nvidia have a pretty strong grip on that market currently -- Corsair would have to pivot pretty hard to get a significant piece of that market, enough so that it'll make up for their dwindling sales of PC parts.

I'm not saying Corsair can't or won't do this, or that it's a bad investment, just want to point out that there are some concerns about how their current business model translates to the future."
2021-06-14 16:39:16,wallstreetbets,I’m legit the biggest retard ever. I bought in on CRSR on leverage when it IPO’d with 500 shares at $17 which would be worth around 15k now but sold due to panic

2021-06-14 10:22:36,wallstreetbets,So part of why it might be undervalued is because one of the major holders (Eagle Tree) is forced to sell shares regardless of the price?

2021-06-14 10:27:42,wallstreetbets,"Revenue growth from acquisitions should not be considered ""growth"". If I own 6 car dealerships and buy 3 more, yes, my business is 50% larger, but my business did not grow 50%. Just be careful to not confuse the two. It is quite difficult to see through the acquisitions and see the core growth rate of the underlying business here.

The good news is gross margin seems to be increasing which suggests the acquisitions are improving the business model. $2 EPS in 2022 does not seem out of reach and the shares look reasonably priced for a potential industry leader in a booming business.

Dell bought Alienware. I see $CRSR as a logical target for any of the large computer equipment companies, maybe even $MSFT."

2021-06-14 11:18:17,wallstreetbets,Does ESPO have Corsair exposure?
2021-06-14 11:22:36,wallstreetbets,Does anyone really think a private equity firm that has plans to reduce it's stake is not going to jump in and sell shares every time the price spikes.  Probably happened today at the open.  Doesn't mean they will sell hard and crush the stock value (because that is also not in their best interest) but it does put a intermediate ceiling on the stock price
2021-06-14 11:25:58,wallstreetbets,You won't be poor for too long ma man!
2021-06-14 11:36:46,wallstreetbets,I’m waiting for a drop to go in heavy. I was ready to buy this morning until I saw premarket 😭

2021-06-14 11:47:06,wallstreetbets,AMC & GME
2021-06-14 11:47:40,wallstreetbets,"I am really looking for Corsair to make a partnership with my other stock. The need for PC parts is increasing and I constantly see value in Corsair products. I saw the movement in pre-market and was confused, but not surprised that it was Corsair. Rocking the Void RGB as we speak!"
2021-06-14 11:47:40,wallstreetbets,"I should also add to this, as someone who worked for Corsair in their Testing Lab:

* They can buy anyone for a review. I was in their labs testing their custom water-cooling kits when the next day I saw Linus literally eating their ass at a tech con for it's mere inception. I asked how he got it so quickly and they said ""We literally gave it to him and paid him $10k. That's his job."" LTT is pretty big name, and even took intel head on, so the fact they can get Linus on their side is big consumer review money.

* Be cautious about their newer products. If they come out with the QL series for example, wait until the Pro or XP versions come out to sell. They know gamers like white stuff, and more frosted LEDs, and will probably go for that soon as it comes out. The strat would be to buy when they dip, hold until an XP/Pro version of their product releases, then sell.

* Corsair support is fucking insane and amazing and the people working it are friendly and understanding as fuck. Even if a product flops, HOLD, they will rectify it and cover it.

* Corsair has great logistics. Most of their metals and manufacturing are done in Vietnam. When I was there, Trump was proposing the 25% tax on goods from China, and a lot of panic was thrown around engineering, but was widely mitigated by CEO and our team saying ""YO HOLD THE FUCK UP AND STOP, WE GOOD.""

TL;DR the DD is Corsair is a monolithic elitist gaming tycoon waiting to splash and I'm so happy I get my fucking stock options now lmao."
2021-06-14 11:49:33,wallstreetbets,Sold some to get the clov gain last week. Time to reinvest!

I remember reading a dd on Corsair a while ago with a lot of the same points including el gatos. Might have been you actually. I agree it’s gonna go up I just have no faith in the actual products besides maybe the el gato streaming devices.

Coming from a dude waiting to pull a trigger on a 3000x series. Running a fairly high end water cooled system with serious audio both desktop speakers and a 1k tube pre amp with 1k plus headphones. I love gaming man. I just don’t have a single Corsair product lol. Maybe my ram is made by Corsair. Even my track pack is by Puretrak and my mouse is the Zowie fk2. Keyboard is hhkb2

If we get a company that does gaming apple style it would be fucking awesome. (Just beautiful devices, great support, etc). Corsair feels too all over the place but hey that’s a lot of revenue streams.  Too bad Steve Jobs literally bullied John carmack from working on games for apple lol after hiring him. What a prick (jobs). We love you Dennis Ritchie!!!

2021-06-14 13:48:31,wallstreetbets,CRSR is great but their products really aren’t as good as some of their competitors. I have gotten a bunch of their equipment. They do not have a well developed client. When your head phones aren’t working or some component it is a bitch to fix and download drivers or trouble shoot. They have good parts and products but they really need to take a page from Logitech’s book on product support. For example their h100 series is a great product but the client to monitor and tweak performance barely works.
2021-06-14 13:49:04,wallstreetbets,Ugh I wish I had bought more july 7 40 dollar calls on friday it cost me 53 bucks at open I went from 53 bucks to 560 bucks current st 520 sheesh 10 bagger
2021-06-14 13:51:04,wallstreetbets,"All this being said, after the premarket moves and if this rally continues higher you can expect EagleTree to sell many more shares earlier than the expected 6 month time frame. So there will be significant downward pressure until they hit that 10% mark. If the rally doesn't continue and this turns out to be a short blip this will be pretty irrelevant in their selling strategy, imo."

2021-06-14 15:07:42,wallstreetbets,Nice DD
2021-06-14 15:08:37,wallstreetbets,Already up almost 4k on the calls i bought from ur 1st dd
2021-06-14 15:17:49,wallstreetbets,Come join me
2021-06-14 15:21:44,wallstreetbets,I’m just hoping for a steady break from the $40 top and we are back flying to the moon !! Great DD 200 shares @ $30
2021-06-14 15:26:17,wallstreetbets,"Well, i hope people will realise all this before my calls expire on Friday."
2021-06-14 15:33:16,wallstreetbets,Ah so buy 1 share i shall
2021-06-14 15:35:55,wallstreetbets,I'm a plug man
2021-06-14 16:28:02,wallstreetbets,crsr all the way
2021-06-14 16:53:22,wallstreetbets,"I like Corsair and have a lot of their products. However, to assume they can capitalize on an over saturated industry with razor thing margins to a degree of doubling or tripling their value in a short time is kind of non sense. 

There is literally nothing stopping from other players from doing what they do and frankly computer parts and gaming chairs dont really have a lot of price discrimination nor brand recognition. In other words, people will buy whatever gets the job done at a low price, basically its a race to the bottom. Last time i checked, everyone cares if their cpu is intel or amd, but no one gives a shit what brand their cooler is."
2021-06-14 17:04:32,wallstreetbets,"I wanted to buy it at 17 but my broker etoro liste it at 32 and bought straight away and I will keep buying it.

Its just the nvidia of ram"
2021-06-14 17:09:19,wallstreetbets,I'm in. I did my own DD after seeing yours. I think this could be a pretty good stock and right now is a good time to buy. Definitely something to hold a long position in. I like it.
2021-06-14 17:21:21,wallstreetbets,Turtle Beach (HEAR) is also performing very well and actually has a better Equity Summary Score on Fidelity (if that means anything to you).  I hold positions for both in my portfolio.
2021-06-14 17:28:43,wallstreetbets,Fuck it. I'm in
2021-06-14 17:42:52,wallstreetbets,"Tldr 
Bought 30 shares"
2021-06-14 18:04:24,wallstreetbets,Hey!  I just saw a MSM article about this.  Good stuff.
2021-06-14 18:05:23,wallstreetbets,"Interestingly enough, this person has exactly the same amount of post karma as he has received in this single post."
2021-06-14 18:18:13,wallstreetbets,"Cool. I love Corsair but, how do you factor in the condition of the PC industry as a whole? It's struggling right now thanks to covid-19 and silicone shortages. It's been impossible for most consumers to buy components to either build or upgrade their rigs for the last year and it isn't looking like that's going to change for at least another year."
2021-06-14 18:19:49,wallstreetbets,I’m in. Like as of 10 minutes ago and now have the confirmation bias I need.
2021-06-14 18:25:12,wallstreetbets,In for a staggering 18 shares. I like the look of this long-term.
2021-06-14 18:27:52,wallstreetbets,Big fan of their products. Was my favorite brand for memory back in the early days. Will be holding CRSR for long term.
2021-06-14 18:32:33,wallstreetbets,It literally can't go tits up
2021-06-14 18:57:23,wallstreetbets,bruh my 45c bags from feb dont feel so heavy now
2021-06-14 19:14:43,wallstreetbets,"Been “stuck” holding CRSR since January after it got a tonnnnn of attention over on this sub. Many people here have played CRSR even last year, and until now it’s mostly been stuck in that range. I’ve personally just been selling CCs on it as I had a feeling it would break out of that stagnant price point at some point. I like the company but damn that stock has been pissing me off for a while."
2021-06-14 19:19:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm curious. Why do you think they're better positioned versus a company like Logitech? A lot of the points you made for Corsair pretty much apply to Logitech too. Except in Logitechs case, they do a lot more than gaming."
2021-06-14 19:23:35,wallstreetbets,This chud didn’t put any rocket ships! Do I buy or do I buy?
2021-06-14 19:42:12,wallstreetbets,and fuck my life I told covered calls way to low of a strike price.
2021-06-14 19:51:36,wallstreetbets,"*sigh*  

sold my shares in CRSR last week at $31.81 to buy GME at $300 (right before the shareholder's meeting)."
2021-06-14 15:08:07,wallstreetbets,"Lol what a joke.  Anyone can make half decent gaming hardware, there’s no world in which Corsair, or anyone else, “makes the industry their bitch.”"
2021-06-14 09:19:40,wallstreetbets,Logitech will own the industry not Corsair.  Logitech and Astro vs Corsair and their cyber power shit PCs and even Shittier mice and keyboards.  Scuf gaming controllers they own are no longer adopted by the pros either as of last year.  Corsair needs a big step up for actual gamers to appreciate their products.  Corsair is like the Walmart brand of gaming.
2021-06-14 17:35:49,wallstreetbets,Every single Corsair product I’ve ever bought has been total garbage.
2021-06-14 16:00:10,wallstreetbets,GME is the only gaming stock I like
2021-06-14 09:58:52,wallstreetbets,Corsair as a company fucks their old/loyal customers in the ass. I don’t think they have what it takes long term unless they drastically change their business model.
2021-06-14 17:02:14,wallstreetbets,I bought a $100 gaming mouse from Corsair and it stopped working after a month and I was unable to get a refund. Due to my own personal experience I refuse to put faith in Corsair stock.
2021-06-14 18:48:32,wallstreetbets,"Blah blah blah, buy my call before Friday is all I hear. You should have told people to buy when it was $30 and they were announced #1 in their market and  killing it in sales in May, when their earnings posted. Not when it’s hitting $40 and your options are about to expire. Quit stealing peoples money. It’s called buy low sell high."
2021-06-14 13:46:45,wallstreetbets,Pump and dump to distract from GME methinks
2021-06-14 16:26:43,wallstreetbets,What happens when graphics cards etc are all hosted on the cloud and you don’t even need hardware anymore ?
2021-06-14 18:34:03,wallstreetbets,"I love Corsair products, and my past 3 personal builds have been Corsair case/cpu... but I am not following a vision of anything that says this is long term profitable, or even profitable long enough to get a 20% return. It's another Best Buy."
2021-06-14 13:41:59,wallstreetbets,Is anyone seriously buying this crap lol this sub is pathetic
2021-06-14 14:39:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I got rid of that underperforming stock today when it hit 40.50"
2021-06-14 16:46:26,wallstreetbets,"Wtf talk likes this
You dumb bitch"
2021-06-14 14:47:31,wallstreetbets,It hasn’t blown up because their peripherals are all trash. No real gamer uses Corsair mice and keyboards
2021-06-14 14:56:40,wallstreetbets,Meh.
2021-06-14 17:50:50,wallstreetbets,"While I see decent upside, Corsair makes pretty mediocre things in an industry full of gimmicks that come and go. You could be flying on top of the world and one bad product ruins it, and someone else wins the mindshare... just look at AMD vs Intel over the years, no one eagerly talks about Intel anymore."
2021-06-14 09:43:37,wallstreetbets,Buy Nio or CLNE?
2021-06-14 10:17:28,wallstreetbets,"Where were you at the ipo. 18$ gang signing in. 

Real DD: all major WoW players use Corsair and have since before twitch/YouTube. The brand reach is further than mt dew and more subliminal than coke at movie. 

Secondly huge pcmr support. Before Noctua poo fans, Corsair cooler was the aaa 

Cool gamer fuel rgb subzero branding helps

And above all a home name in pc parts. 

TLDR: Brand recognition and 10+ years existing at the front of one of gamings biggest titles ever. Make me think they ain’t going anywhere and I’ll keep buying their products. 

Long it"
2021-06-14 10:43:36,wallstreetbets,I bought some! This is a great analysis too
2021-06-14 12:15:28,wallstreetbets,"The numbers you're quoting are for pandemic sales when everyone had to stay indoors and all that.

How do you reconcile that with the end of lockdowns? People picked up gaming or fancy peripherals to keep themselves entertained/happy during lockdowns and had the benefit of pandemic shimmy checks for spending money, but now they won't really need that because everything is open and the world is returning to normal. I'm willing to bet the used market will see a large influx of goods from people selling rigs and peripherals."
2021-06-14 13:39:47,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-14 13:45:58,wallstreetbets,Only GME 🦍
2021-06-14 15:50:31,wallstreetbets,Are people holding this or dumping?
2021-06-14 16:54:07,wallstreetbets,Nah razed
2021-06-14 17:27:07,wallstreetbets,"I work in the same industry and I can guarantee that Corsair are getting positively pummeled by the Chinese shipping and warehouse situation. Long term Corsair is a good investment and a solid company but we are likely to see bad results in the coming quarter, especially after the boosted corona times and it will not print tendies in the short term."
2021-06-14 19:56:59,wallstreetbets,Corsair acquired Origin and they have done a not-so-good job at managing it. IDK about this one.
2021-06-14 10:56:53,wallstreetbets,"Sounds interesting, Docusign has rallied a bit too much but under $300 is a steal. Used Corsair for the build, but obviously 2020 was a huge move for the desktop PC market.

Normies use tablets, phones, and laptops and will most likely accelerate. Be careful extrapolating that desktop PC growth, because disappointment can slam valuation."
2021-06-14 11:34:48,wallstreetbets,Let’s go BB!!
2021-06-14 11:44:22,wallstreetbets,I don't think I can invest in Corsair since every mouse I buy from them breaks within 3 months. pieces of hot garbage
2021-06-14 11:51:19,wallstreetbets,Im in!
2021-06-14 12:24:01,wallstreetbets,Sold out today. Chart reminds me of RKT
2021-06-14 13:36:28,wallstreetbets,the only way one Manufacturer would pass another is if they decided to stop making dog shit products that break after a few year requiring replacement and make decent hardware. but that would essentially kill their business model
2021-06-14 13:55:42,wallstreetbets,Corsair can’t even make a functioning AIO under 200 lmfao
2021-06-14 15:48:58,wallstreetbets,Too long. Summary?
2021-06-14 16:11:42,wallstreetbets,Wonder how razer stock would fare against Corsair stock.
2021-06-14 16:27:38,wallstreetbets,"Sold some December 17 70c. Saw the good dd when everyone was panic selling last month and decided to buy in. -9% since yesterday, over 300% today. Was thinking when it's gonna pop. Thanks wsb"
2021-06-14 16:41:57,wallstreetbets,"I sold 5 shares today, made about 7% profit. Do you think I should’ve held longer?"
2021-06-14 17:04:04,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the DD. Grabbed 1,900 shares AH at 36 even. Holding until at least 100!"
2021-06-14 17:23:54,wallstreetbets,"Where’s all the “this is a pump and dump, the only play is AMC. Apes and shit”"
2021-06-14 18:02:42,wallstreetbets,"Corsair sell products and people have been sitting and home doing nothing but buying products during the pandemic. This means that buying will almost certainly shift to services due to the reopening and because products are overbought. What does this mean for Corsair? Probably stagnation is my guess.

Buy they are indeed undervalued fundamentally, its just not a massive upside and a catalyst must come for there to be one"
2021-06-14 18:17:37,wallstreetbets,do they have connections in china? Corsair is not liked or popular amongst gamers i know.
2021-06-14 15:00:38,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I bought near the peak just before the shareholder meeting. 

But I wouldn't have if I didn't think there was long term value.

Just don't buy stocks you don't believe have long term value and you'll be fine ""bag holding"". It's only an issue in meme stocks really.

Everyone bing else you know will rebound."
2021-06-14 11:33:20,wallstreetbets,I did drop it😔
2021-06-14 09:26:26,wallstreetbets,"Same, in it for month's now. Was hoping it would trade sideways for a while longer to add more."
2021-06-14 09:58:10,wallstreetbets,"Hahah i 2nd that. He lost a lot on crsr actually then did some other dumbass yolo posts. Think he is down $500k at least
Edit: he up the $500k."
2021-06-14 14:42:14,wallstreetbets,"i mean its fucking corsair

nothing like taking some fresh ass ram stick right out of the clamshell , taking a big whiff, before fucking your motherboard with them"
2021-06-14 11:45:28,wallstreetbets,"I’m still holding from December, back in the green baby!"
2021-06-14 09:29:32,wallstreetbets,I saw his posts and making a million. I was waiting on the sidelines for the right point. Now I feel it's well priced.
2021-06-14 12:22:03,wallstreetbets,I thought I remembered a lot of CRSR hype a while back.
2021-06-14 09:41:40,wallstreetbets,that guy bought into gme as well and sold at the first red that came in his account a week later
2021-06-14 09:41:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah one guy pump and dumped an entire stock top kek. I forget you’re supposed to be a retard and never take profits
2021-06-14 09:41:56,wallstreetbets,Tell me you sold some cc's at market open today for actual free money
2021-06-14 11:07:42,wallstreetbets,">Just don’t let that SirJackALot dude tell you he was the OG CRSR guy. He pumped and dumped so fast and left a lot of bag holders on here in Dec. I’m glad they’re finally getting saved by everyone else on WSB.

It's thanks to him that I've been watching it for almost a year now though and finally got in at a good entry point"
2021-06-14 19:27:47,wallstreetbets,"I love how these posts come up when the stock has already risen 30%.

Creating an entire new generation of bag holders"
2021-06-14 13:31:57,wallstreetbets,I didn't even realize corsair was public. Would have hopped on a while ago
2021-06-14 11:03:17,wallstreetbets,Been in since IPO kinda annoyed it took this long for wsb to get onboard
2021-06-14 13:23:48,wallstreetbets,"In it for months already, reduced my position by 25% today. There were plenty of prior threads and CRSR is recommended a lot on youtube as well."
2021-06-14 18:04:04,wallstreetbets,All my homies hate sirjackalot
2021-06-14 16:57:42,wallstreetbets,I’ll believe in Corsair when they can update my software app without corrupting the whole thing or resetting my devices lol.
2021-06-14 11:07:40,wallstreetbets,"If you want to hold something for the long term you belong in r/investing not WSB. Sirjack doesn't pump and dump anything, do you know what a pump and dump is?"
2021-06-14 12:43:24,wallstreetbets,I'm relatively new here but have been holding crsr for a few months. I should expect a massive pump and dump now that it's a top post on this sub the same day it went up?
2021-06-14 14:51:42,wallstreetbets,I mean in the text space this has always been one of the strongest companies and has no sign of slowing down.
2021-06-14 15:27:42,wallstreetbets,"I have been eyeing this stock for a while, sold it at the top and was waiting for it to jump back up. Back on board baby!"
2021-06-14 16:12:46,wallstreetbets,"I started investing in September when my college got moved online. Corsair was my first investment because I own a corsair mouse, keyboard, and internals."
2021-06-14 17:42:09,wallstreetbets,"Me too, I bought a ton when it IPOd then it slowly started falling, but I don’t doubt at all that Corsair will dominate the PC gaming industry. They make quality products and have great customer support"
2021-06-14 19:28:08,wallstreetbets,It’s funny that my custom water cooling loop is mostly Corsair and I didn’t even realize until this post that it was a publicly traded company. I’m feeling it long term. It’s just easier/safer buying Corsair branded products even though they charge a premium because you know they will work.
2021-06-14 17:01:27,wallstreetbets,Jack is a short term swing trader. It's not pump and dump. It's just taking profits based on thesis.
2021-06-14 10:31:51,wallstreetbets,As a gamer I just like their product
2021-06-14 10:22:53,wallstreetbets,What’s your price target ?
2021-06-14 15:24:46,wallstreetbets,"Sorry Dude. It can be 20% undervalued, 30% etc but not 100%. That's a big time error on my abacus."
2021-06-14 10:15:43,wallstreetbets,I would caution people once it's +55 or higher.
2021-06-14 10:53:04,wallstreetbets,His first one was two days earlier though
2021-06-14 11:05:42,wallstreetbets,"It’s been posted about a few times over the last 2 months or so. And a quick look at their financials will show you the company is in a solid position. 

246 shares @ ~$33.01. Long $CRSR 📈"
2021-06-14 09:53:55,wallstreetbets,"Well, not something I expected when writing it."
2021-06-14 12:12:26,wallstreetbets,"When I used to post DD on a weekly basis, I'd actually wait for a move like this and then post.

The reason is, if you post on a good day to buy, aka a red day (even on purpose)

1) Nobody upvotes your post

2) People think you're retarded

3) Your post might get removed

4) You might even get banned.

So my account had about ~3000 followers and I was posting DD left and right. One day I decided to make a post on OKE which just so happen to go down that day, but was up 6% the next day. I was banned for my post and I never posted DD ever again."
2021-06-14 11:44:43,wallstreetbets,"He posted something similar last Friday, and I took a stab at it. I was very happy when I checked my account this morning."
2021-06-14 14:36:14,wallstreetbets,"dd for corsair has been posted half a year ago and longer, it remains solid"
2021-06-14 14:31:14,wallstreetbets,"Here's a list of all DD's mentioning CRSR. There are quite a few. Works for any stock, just change the ticker at the end. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/crsr"
2021-06-14 12:15:44,wallstreetbets,That is the long history of financial and sports reporting.  All the experts love to tell you in excruciating detail exactly why something already happened.
2021-06-14 13:44:09,wallstreetbets,"Wait until Intel hits 70 and all the “Intel is undervalued” comes out.   I’ve been saying it for over. A year but as always it will be treated as a surprise.  Lol.

As if SHW wasn’t the best purchase in 2015 lololol"
2021-06-14 14:53:55,wallstreetbets,"If he's right (and I think he is), 30% move is just the start. This stock doubling from here is not unreasonable in the least. Company is doing really well and future looks bright."
2021-06-14 18:54:39,wallstreetbets,"Right… buy my option at the peak so I can make more by Friday, is all I hear. Fuck this guy."
2021-06-14 11:59:15,wallstreetbets,Part I was done before this. OP has some great DD and there are plenty. Go up and type in CRSR in that search bar and you will see it. Way undervalued play in a growth stonk and a red hot sector.
2021-06-14 12:54:54,wallstreetbets,"Almost as if it was written by or for someone who has the ability to drive that kind of price action in premarket, like I dunno, Mr. Griffin"
2021-06-14 12:56:12,wallstreetbets,"there were other post before market closed on friday with a bunch of upvotes. Train isn't over yet tho, it could do $20 swings"
2021-06-14 13:00:35,wallstreetbets,Plenty of dd before the move too.
2021-06-14 13:25:31,wallstreetbets,"I'd like to know what institutions are behind it.

Inb4 shitadel is in for a big position"
2021-06-14 14:40:54,wallstreetbets,"Wow , just like mainstream news

get this guy a job at MSNBC so they can tell me why the market moved based upon random events that happened just before it."
2021-06-14 15:43:42,wallstreetbets,His dump ain't pumped enough.
2021-06-14 18:22:16,wallstreetbets,I woke up super happy this morning on this. Had no idea Corsair was even on people's radar but had $5k work of it already. Woke up going WTF?!?
2021-06-14 12:40:18,wallstreetbets,"just wait, it will be back down to 35 by friday"
2021-06-14 16:57:03,wallstreetbets,Because of short interest. I do not know why it is shorted so much.
2021-06-14 10:10:28,wallstreetbets,I was waiting for that to happen too. 30-31 was a perfect base to consolidate.
2021-06-14 11:21:02,wallstreetbets,Because of this post.
2021-06-14 13:44:26,wallstreetbets,"Because it’s hedgefunds latest pump and dump, you haven’t caught on yet? Where’s RKT, SNDL, CLOV?? They all got pumped and dumped hard through WSB, it’s so obvious at this point."
2021-06-14 12:52:06,wallstreetbets,Viagra
2021-06-14 13:44:28,wallstreetbets,Coz it's a heavily manipulated stock like the dd mentions
2021-06-14 09:42:52,wallstreetbets,Aaaaaand we're down
2021-06-14 09:43:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah OP is having a [good](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:GRAPE_FRUIT_EXTRACT) day
2021-06-14 10:09:54,wallstreetbets,"Happy to hear! I'm really stoked for their next earnings in August, but wouldn't be surprised to see $50 before then (especially if the retards at CNBC pick it up)."
2021-06-14 09:25:44,wallstreetbets,congrats and fuck you and pls spare me some bread I need to eat this month
2021-06-14 11:05:32,wallstreetbets,i closed 10 6/18 35 calls i bought last week at 0.35 for 7.26 this morning on the open lol wild stuff
2021-06-14 12:11:39,wallstreetbets,"Since you sold, its gonna keep going up"
2021-06-14 13:57:55,wallstreetbets,"Did the same today. In @ 32, out @42.5. Once this is off WSB re-Enter @32"
2021-06-14 14:39:55,wallstreetbets,"Opposite, almost. This is the first WSB stock that I feel comfortable buying and holding.  Sure, I made a little money off BB and TLRY, but cashed out once I had a decent profit and didn't hold.  This one I'm holding long enough to see if it goes to the moon!  (I don't know how to do rocket emojis but this is where I would put them).

I don't mind being left holding the bag with this one."
2021-06-14 09:59:05,wallstreetbets,ALREADY DOWN $500 IN STOCK AND $400 IN OPTIONS. YUP. I NEED AN ADULT AND TO STOP FOLLOWING WSB.
2021-06-14 14:49:51,wallstreetbets,Well today's your chance to get out. I'd definitely set a stop loss when it gets over $40 (not a financial advice)
2021-06-14 16:33:21,wallstreetbets,I’m in Nz and wake up with about 2 hours of market left so I never buy the open and it works for me 😂
2021-06-14 17:17:31,wallstreetbets,The dumpers will be flushed out quickly. Getting this amazing company in front of more people is the goal here.
2021-06-14 12:40:37,wallstreetbets,one could say it's all that you could corspair?

2021-06-14 14:56:40,wallstreetbets,Everything is factoring in post covid because there is more money now in our economy and people have more to spend.
2021-06-14 13:42:52,wallstreetbets,There’s growth potential but the massive question mark with this stock is it being held like 30% by an outside investor who hasn’t made their intentions clear.

2021-06-14 11:54:40,wallstreetbets,The only reason it went down was due to shorting...It is easily a $70 stock if it was never shorted.
2021-06-14 09:25:49,wallstreetbets,I wish bra.
2021-06-14 09:42:18,wallstreetbets,It opened near 42 and went down. Is this a dip opportunity or the dump from the pump?  Your answer to that will answer your question
2021-06-14 09:12:09,wallstreetbets,wait 30-60mins after open to see the movement. or if you really have fomo then buy at open
2021-06-14 09:10:35,wallstreetbets,Probably man
2021-06-14 09:52:42,wallstreetbets,"Sell some puts, IV spiked pretty decent"

2021-06-14 12:25:12,wallstreetbets,A gap like that will probably retrace. Keep it on your radar and buy then. Patience
2021-06-14 12:53:51,wallstreetbets,"My problem with Corsair is that they really just don't make good products. They don't have any peripherals that anyone into eSports (very important part of PC gaming market) would find appealing, their RAM is currently seen as low quality, and their cases are meh. 

A lot of their products such as their RGB fans and AIO watercoolers are just OEM rebrands. 

Their power supplies are still well regarded albeit expensive for what you get."
2021-06-14 09:12:54,wallstreetbets,DDs like this aim to fabricate demand for the stock.

2021-06-14 10:21:22,wallstreetbets,doubt. 10X at MOST. $100 is realistic within 2 years. $300 maybe
2021-06-14 16:56:09,wallstreetbets,More growth potential. Logitech is for old people or office work though these days the young guys like myself order some corsair stuff with company funds.
2021-06-14 09:22:21,wallstreetbets,"Plus Corsair isn’t anything new. Yes there’s huge long term potential but there’s also a lot of obstacles, the lack of stock namely to be one. Most gaming and accessory companies are facing stock issues due to chip shortages. 

The sudden amount of posts with no new developments in its business environment reeks of a pump and dump."
2021-06-14 09:15:25,wallstreetbets,"Right let's go back to pumping meme stocks with shitty fundamentals, that's way more legit."

2021-06-14 11:57:01,wallstreetbets,That is the same for any post for any stock on here... Its literally up 5 dollars from its Friday close and still has not even reached its average analyst PT... I would not call that a pump and dump....
2021-06-14 09:05:34,wallstreetbets,When in doubt wait for the run down that follows.
2021-06-14 09:25:27,wallstreetbets,It's your call. If you don't feel comfortable then just watch from the sidelines. I want to hold this long term.
2021-06-14 09:13:55,wallstreetbets,Longer term it should go to its fair value which is above 60$. Market had it wrong below 35$.
2021-06-14 09:34:39,wallstreetbets,Pümp it then dümp it
2021-06-14 09:58:18,wallstreetbets,Merci!

There is so much adjusting of positions happening that it can totally mess up your perception of what will happen.

2021-06-14 12:59:23,wallstreetbets,Jesus. Post some pics please.

2021-06-14 19:01:03,wallstreetbets,Real dd is in the comments
2021-06-14 09:19:34,wallstreetbets,Their quality exceeds the “competition” if you can even call it that. Just compare Corsairs iCue software with Asus Aura or Gigabyte RGB fusion. They don’t even do the same amount of functions as Corsairs iCue.
2021-06-14 15:44:23,wallstreetbets,yikes hello there bagholder
2021-06-14 09:27:26,wallstreetbets,I've been on WSB since jerking of over KaloBios.
2021-06-14 09:52:44,wallstreetbets,"I have used their RAM for ages without any issues and I also think that the PCBuilding community would disagree with you, especially with their cases. To each their own I guess - I also have multiple keyboards and a zowie mouse."
2021-06-14 10:58:26,wallstreetbets,I would think they will be fixing any problems.  It is still a smallish company.
2021-06-14 14:26:27,wallstreetbets,Can you now break down GME and AMC fundamentals for everyone.
2021-06-14 14:04:31,wallstreetbets,"Same as Gamestock and AMC, nothing has changed in the last 20 years with them either."
2021-06-14 16:00:51,wallstreetbets,"> Corsair has been around forever.

It IPO-ed in September of 2020...."
2021-06-14 17:49:25,wallstreetbets,And buying a bunch of companies.

2021-06-14 09:31:51,wallstreetbets,"Then don't! Not financial advice, obviously, but I gave in to fomo with $MVIS and, like the true retard I am, managed to get them at 28$. 

You don't wanna be me - hell, I don't wanna be me!"
2021-06-14 18:28:58,wallstreetbets,Trying to get WSB to like stocks which are actually making good money is terrible I know. Almost better to chase companies going bankrupt right.
2021-06-14 11:44:10,wallstreetbets,Well someone is gotta do the work right.
2021-06-14 11:43:14,wallstreetbets,Mentioned this already. I've been here since we fucked with KaloBios and AMD $5 gang.
2021-06-14 10:23:09,wallstreetbets,"If he's a good stock broker, why is he driving an uberX"
2021-06-14 10:04:25,wallstreetbets,Not true. It's a company with fantastic financials. People want to pump and dump trash stocks.
2021-06-14 12:35:27,wallstreetbets,Literally everything posted here gets labelled a meme stock by the media. Corsair has had a long lasting and solid reputation as an industry leader in computer peripherals and components. It's a solid value stock with large growth potential.
2021-06-14 12:29:49,wallstreetbets,"Their hardware isn't even that great imo. I've owned 3 corsair mice, 2 keyboards, 2 liquid coolers and a psu. The computer hardware isn't terrible but the peripherals are fucking garbage. Sticky buttons, random disconnection, no built in rgb memory, build quality is lacking... Not to mention their icue software is absolute trash and corrupted the part of the cmos that controls my mobo's leds, because corsair can't just respect that some consumers don't want corsair software to dictate what their hardware can do. Now my leds don't work at all and corsair support said ""tough luck, blame Asus""."
2021-06-14 16:16:30,wallstreetbets,Most decent size companies will be involved with citadel in some way surely?
2021-06-14 11:38:36,wallstreetbets,They can. All they need to do is have their sales people target the younger companies. Logitech dominance is primary from office use in lieu of gaming is growing faster than office use.

2021-06-14 11:59:04,wallstreetbets,Those are MEMEs but CRSR is a good company with suppressed price due to shorts.
2021-06-14 18:00:25,wallstreetbets,"I mean, Razer is kind of doing the apply style for gaming. I love their gaming laptops, but I think Corsair is more of a ""middle of the road"" company. I think for cases, they are very well regarded in the hardcore gaming segment, but things like mouses and keyboards will always be highly subjective. I also got a Zowie EC2 but could never warm up to the hhkb2. Might need to try different switches."
2021-06-14 17:24:47,wallstreetbets,"Don't feel bad about buying the top, but maybe do yourself a favour and look at their numbers before buying in. Do you think a company that makes 1.10m in revenue and 410 employees deserves a market cap of 9.5 billion? I guess you could always justify it, but I would rather focus on value plays than crazy moonshots.

2021-06-14 16:58:57,wallstreetbets,Both. Humping.
2021-06-14 12:00:30,wallstreetbets,Maybe you got the bottom of the line one. You do realize engineering is done at cost points. Most mice at the lower end aren't made to last with abuse. Their power supplies are the best on the market.
2021-06-14 17:18:40,wallstreetbets,Yup holdin $4000@ $42 avg. long
2021-06-14 14:02:36,wallstreetbets,"Keep your head up, mate. I dumped my bags prematurely on many occasions before. You live and you learn. There will be other Corsairs."
2021-06-14 13:39:55,wallstreetbets,Same here. I was expecting at least another few weeks of sideways trading. I bought 50 shares at 31.50 Friday morning and was planning on averaging in this week. I added another 600 shares this morning during the dip so now my average is 36.75.
2021-06-14 10:07:41,wallstreetbets,"Yup bought some leaps last week, even the leaps tripled,"
2021-06-14 09:29:04,wallstreetbets,"It was actually a pretty nice stock to swing trade, but I never took advantage of it."
2021-06-14 17:34:22,wallstreetbets,"Same, I've got about $10k and made another $30k (international) transfer to my brokerage account last week and was planning to load up under $35, but the apes beat me to it.

Oh well, made $600 selling the $70 Aug 20 calls at open"
2021-06-14 17:36:51,wallstreetbets,He kind of did. And he sold the very next day to get into MT. Which he did the same yo
2021-06-14 13:52:19,wallstreetbets,"Wait til this shit blast past $45 and your cc are bringing your portfolio down... Idk, tried it never worked well for me. Low IV stocks are cheaper but easier to take the free money. These shit volatile af so it's easier to shoot yourself in the foot feels like."
2021-06-14 11:35:52,wallstreetbets,"He’s the king of pump and dumps. Fuck that guy. He thinks he can use WSB as his own money printer, at least until he got drowned out by all the new people from r/all. 
And yeah okay man, I’ll fuck off to r/investing with all my gains. I guess WSB’s hero DFV should too since he held for more than a week."
2021-06-14 12:55:34,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, it depends if this sub decides to keep the momentum up and outsiders pile in too. This could just be a one day thing or it could last a few days/weeks. Check out the other socks that have been talked about the last few weeks and see where they’re at. It will give you some idea of what to possibly expect. I won’t be surprised if we see a sell off after hours or tomorrow, because that’s usually what happens with this stock after it runs up a bit. Today’s volume has been crazy compared to the average though.

Just remember, there’s nothing wrong with taking profits. People on here will have you holding forever, but if you made some and are happy then feel free to sell."
2021-06-14 10:40:57,wallstreetbets,"Funny, as a gamer I will never use a Corsair product. Doesn't mean I won't make money off the stock though :)"
2021-06-14 11:41:26,wallstreetbets,"head to head corsair void headset vs logitech  - corsair is 2x as good, same price"
2021-06-14 11:32:23,wallstreetbets,As a gamer you know how small their market share is lol
2021-06-14 11:10:56,wallstreetbets,45ish
2021-06-14 13:50:26,wallstreetbets,"Mine is about 45-50 for a “stable” price. I could see it meme-ing to 60 or so, but I don’t think that would be a sustainable price."
2021-06-14 13:54:09,wallstreetbets,Up. I figure it’ll have similar valuation as Logitech.
2021-06-14 19:52:00,wallstreetbets,I didn’t mean it’s price should be double I was saying there’s no doubt that it’s undervalued
2021-06-14 10:31:43,wallstreetbets,"I’ve had it for a while now. Just waiting for people to see how good of a market share they have and how much it’s undervalue.

The only hate I’ve seen on this DD is some guy complaining about anecdotal customer service experience he had and how that means they are a terrible investment lmfao ain’t no ape thats a smooth brain 🐒"
2021-06-14 15:12:32,wallstreetbets,I mean you always want to frontload before the pump.
2021-06-14 11:42:40,wallstreetbets,I mean if you want to PC gaming and building computers at all then it’s a company name that you hear a lot for a wide range of products
2021-06-14 14:05:25,wallstreetbets,WSB has been pumping and dumping CRSR since the IPO.
2021-06-14 15:00:29,wallstreetbets,Bro was your first dd released on a saturday!?
2021-06-14 15:13:12,wallstreetbets,Did you not look at PM before you wrote it?
2021-06-14 12:15:38,wallstreetbets,"Fair, because people will read DD then immediately buy lol so short sighted and don’t even pay attention to the chart"
2021-06-14 11:54:35,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-14 14:17:32,wallstreetbets,Me too!
2021-06-14 14:29:44,wallstreetbets,"I missed out on getting in early cause I basically live under a rock when it comes to ""get in early"" DD reports, but I'm not fomo'ing just because it's rallying.

This looks like a good ticker to go long on once it passes the WSB front page and after the MSM does all their ""Video Game and Movie stocks are dead, get into CORSAIR now!"" articles, then I'll buy in."
2021-06-14 10:20:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah even during the red March weeks it seems to have a support level at $31

Man I wish I had sold some covered 6/18 50C this morning when it opened around $42, they were going for like $4 each.  If it had stayed at that level and WSB had joined in I probably would have been fucked by a gamma squeeze though (the calls were up like 1500% this morning and $50 was the highest strike price for 6/18)"
2021-06-14 11:48:43,wallstreetbets,What about now? Like $37.
2021-06-14 14:32:57,wallstreetbets,I think your post single handedly was responsible for so much volume today. Bravo!!
2021-06-14 12:37:55,wallstreetbets,Ha no way.  Popped in premarket.  WSB definitely doesn’t move markets before the bell
2021-06-14 12:37:49,wallstreetbets,"It's been fighting a $32 dollar resistance for quite a while.

The lid was already loosened, just needed one last turn."
2021-06-14 09:54:26,wallstreetbets,Are we down or is CRSR on discount?
2021-06-14 11:35:14,wallstreetbets,"  
Aaaaand we're up"
2021-06-14 11:12:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah that shit went flop so fast. Was hoping CRSR will bring a 100% home run today after so much hype over the weekend.
2021-06-14 14:26:21,wallstreetbets,Aaaaaand we're up
2021-06-14 09:38:08,wallstreetbets,%550 gain on open and still holding lol I might be retarded
2021-06-14 16:08:08,wallstreetbets,"Nope, another day another pump and dump scheme on wsb."
2021-06-14 18:13:17,wallstreetbets,"yup, same. I don't trust these reddit rallies, we will have a chance again at 32 soon enough"
2021-06-14 18:15:11,wallstreetbets,"This seriously might not come back to $32 (but I hope it does, that's my CB). 
CRSR has legitimately great fundamentals and its undervalued right now, so I think this attention is going to attract a lot of institutional and retail investors who want to hold because its an amazing company."
2021-06-14 19:07:43,wallstreetbets,Here you go mate. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-14 10:43:47,wallstreetbets,"Keep chomping on the crayons, it'll keep you busy so you don't buy more!"
2021-06-14 11:03:45,wallstreetbets,"assuming your options are down because you bought them today... probably don't want to buy options when a stock is up 40% premarket. your shares are very safe though and i personally would DCA, but do your own research and make your own decisions."
2021-06-14 12:53:07,wallstreetbets,That was retarded. Just the way me likes it

2021-06-14 09:45:41,wallstreetbets,Not falling for the dip today😤
2021-06-14 09:12:35,wallstreetbets,I like waiting.. made mistake of buying at open too many times
2021-06-14 09:11:03,wallstreetbets,"Bummer, I’ll just stay poor"
2021-06-14 14:27:12,wallstreetbets,"Corsair is a “premium”brand in the PC space. Their products aren’t amazing but they aren’t bad either. The fact they can sell a 3 pack of “OEM fans” for $120 tells me about how much people are willing to pay for corsair stuff. When people go to build their own PC chances are they’re looking at Corsair products first as the name is familiar. They see it in Best Buy and Target, and online their presence is very noticeable in PC communities. And IDK why you’re trying to say they’re not popular in eSports when they sponsor teams like Vitality and Envy. I say all this while the only Corsair product I use is a mouse pad. I personally think its a safe long term investment. They have a lot of different product offerings that the only thing I see taking them out is  if they all went tits up."
2021-06-14 16:04:27,wallstreetbets,Their power supplies are rebrands too
2021-06-14 17:24:27,wallstreetbets,"Seems to be pretty bad take considering their growth numbers. You might think their products are shit, but there seems to be quite a few consumers that disagree."
2021-06-14 09:36:11,wallstreetbets,"And you see quite a few for crsr recently too. All giving similar layout and presented info.

Updated positions: not planning to buy anymore"
2021-06-14 17:04:34,wallstreetbets,"logitech stock more than doubled over the past year tho. . . Furthermore they are competitive if not leading in the very space you mention all the wile targeting more sectors. heck even the mouse i currently use is the logitech mx vertical. I dont have a horse in either, but then this discussion came up last year when i had Logitech logi was the better bet. I should have kept it looking at things now, but corsair hasnt really changed much and any ""growth would just be then growing into what logi already is. 

Im an ape tho dont take my word."
2021-06-14 09:29:29,wallstreetbets,"Being a happy user of their very nice peripherals, I'd like to add their icue bloatware as another obstacle. 

But then again, their competition's software is just as bad or even worse, so... yay?"
2021-06-14 12:34:19,wallstreetbets,"Corsair isn't anything new but went public recently so people talking about it more now makes sense after consecutive positive earnings calls. The chip shortage is always talked about on the calls, and the lack of stock has prevented their sales numbers from being much higher. I've owned a lot of Corsair for months now. Hopefully it isn't just people dumping as it has long term potential."
2021-06-14 13:37:15,wallstreetbets,This is the way

2021-06-14 09:09:43,wallstreetbets,"This is not great advice. Best thing you can do is chase. Jump in for like 20% of what you’re prepared to invest, then if it keeps going up, throw another 40% in with a stop loss that protects a little profit, then the other 40% if it’s still going up. You want to benefit from a run to the upside"

At the peak in the morning my CRSR hit 125k briefly, sold 50 so I could add more to SENS, now i have 251 calls. I have 425 calls in SENS

my gain post will be the 2k in CLOV -> GOEV -> CRSR + SENS -> Valhalla"
2021-06-14 17:46:49,wallstreetbets,Whos products will GME stock?
2021-06-14 15:02:16,wallstreetbets,That's my point exactly and why these threads are stupid.
2021-06-14 18:37:59,wallstreetbets,How many did they buy after IPO?
2021-06-14 11:54:34,wallstreetbets,So? I don't give a fuck if you are 1R0NYMANS best friend. This isn't dd.

2021-06-14 16:24:49,wallstreetbets,WSB as a pump and dump for Citadel ties is way to convenient... just pointing out to those that would not rather contribute towards their bottom line.
2021-06-14 12:18:40,wallstreetbets,"I think you're a bit overly bullish, but they do have an edge on others in the industry in that they actually make computer hardware unlike Dell w/ Alienware. But ""swalling"" the industry is a bit optimistic.

When this rally is over, I'll start to pick up XXX shares. :)

Corsair did a really good job with their HyperX keyboard. Here is Sean Gares doing a review. He has a twitch or youtube vod where he talks about the process, but he spent a year testing keyboards and providing input.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ES7e8b\_6Ls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ES7e8b_6Ls)

I'll try to find the VOD where he talks more in depth about his involvement."
2021-06-14 11:16:09,wallstreetbets,Any sources on this?
2021-06-14 12:02:43,wallstreetbets,"They are trying to divide us, thus decreasing our power together."
2021-06-14 12:01:52,wallstreetbets,"AMC & GME are good companies that we need to focus solely on, not distractions like these."
2021-06-14 18:29:07,wallstreetbets,Hey you know what a hhkb2 is you’re awwwright in my book. Thanks for the DD. You are right it’s highly subjective and I’m definitely not a casual user. Most people will go out and buy Corsair keyboards forsure. Especially their mechanicals.

Figured a homie should see what I’m talking about haha :) much love"
2021-06-14 17:56:31,wallstreetbets,I’m just saying if regular gamers don’t need to buy expensive hardware anymore because graphics cards etc are hosted and you can stream from any device basically  ... would hurt their scale. When they went public that was one of the risks listed in their SEC filing.
2021-06-14 15:33:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they’re fine, they work, they have nice LED’s, but there’s just so much better out there. That’s the problem. 

Their mice, I don’t think a single gamer uses any of their mice.

Their ram was the go to ram 15 years ago but now all pre builts and self builds use gskill or tforce. Also their dominator ram was nearly purchased by no one the past 2 years because of larger cpu cooler fans and people wanting smaller cases. They had clearance issues 

Their psu’s are fine but heavy competition, most prefer EVGA 

Without bestbuy selling their products, Corsair would be bankrupt."
2021-06-14 13:31:04,wallstreetbets,"Never said it was, but part of why hardware is so difficult to find is because of the pandemic. A lot of people that got into gaming because there was no alternative will return to their previous lifestyles."
2021-06-14 12:10:43,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you but they are far from the *best* PSUs. They do make *good* power supplies, but the problem with this segment of the market is you'll get a sale from a consumer once every 8 years. Catch-22. Admittedly this helps to build brand loyalty. If a consumer thinks, hey, my corsair powersupply has lasted me this long, I'm sure their SSD and RAM will be just as good."
2021-06-14 13:26:58,wallstreetbets,Caught a 30x bagger with the July 45 calls...they were trading at 12 cents last week.
2021-06-14 17:58:08,wallstreetbets,What are leaps ? Can you give a quick tldr version of it ?
2021-06-14 14:20:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah it reminded me of AMD in 2017 where it would consistently fluctuate between $8-11…. except I sold when it broke $12 and stopped trading at that point. Corsair I’m extremely confident in.
2021-06-14 18:03:44,wallstreetbets,">45 and your cc are bringing your portfolio down... Idk, tried it never worked well for me. Low IV stocks are cheaper but easier to take the free money. These shit volatile af so it's easier to shoot yourself in the foot feels like.

To me it's kind of an added bonus, it keeps me from getting too greedy and ending up a bag holder. I sold a shit load of covered calls on CCIV and halved my cost basis in two months and I thought I was so dumb when I got exercised on my $40 calls and it plummeted back down into the teens"
2021-06-14 11:37:34,wallstreetbets,"Again, you don't know what a pump and dump is. Maybe you should look it up. Educate yourself"
2021-06-14 11:04:37,wallstreetbets,60% of my current PC (and my previous PCs) is made of Corsair products! Corsair makes good stuff.
2021-06-14 11:43:39,wallstreetbets,">  as a gamer I will never use a Corsair product.

Is there some explicit reason why? You said that like it held some weight."
2021-06-14 11:44:03,wallstreetbets,"Can I ask why?

Genuine curiosity."
2021-06-14 12:09:06,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-06-14 11:43:23,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I open my apps and all I do is get advertisements for Extenz, doge, bitcoin , and Corsair products. I thought they were pretty important."
2021-06-14 11:44:52,wallstreetbets,"You're not that in the know, are you. Lolol

They are only slightly smaller than razer at its peak."
2021-06-14 13:59:30,wallstreetbets,I won't use anything but their power supplies.
2021-06-14 19:32:36,wallstreetbets,"As a pc builder / enthusiasts I fucking hate corsair  and will never use their products.

Icue is the devils spawn and is so shit with all their proprietary connectors 


Their only leg up was they had the og rainbow fans (LL series) but Thermaltake takes the crown for best looking fans now.

Vast majority of their cases restrict airflow and are pretty dog shit.

Pau are OK, but my preferable is seasonic because they are the oem and their  warranty (or evga) is (was?) better.


But at the end of the day they spend all their money on Advertising so they'll probably get the most buys"
2021-06-14 15:18:12,wallstreetbets,Corsair doesn’t make great pc gaming products if we’re being honest
2021-06-14 11:16:15,wallstreetbets,"i sold 13x of those babies 

got $3.4 each"
2021-06-14 17:25:54,wallstreetbets,I'm still in awe. Never hit the front page of WSB before. 60 million in volume is crazy.
2021-06-14 12:49:30,wallstreetbets,90% of the idiots here don't even know how to buy in pre/after market hours lol

2021-06-14 09:59:59,wallstreetbets,We're down as in a lot of smart Corsair buyers turned other people into Corsair bagholders and cashed out
2021-06-14 11:44:58,wallstreetbets,what I don't get is why you wouldn't sell that and then use the returns to buy some slightly more retarded bets
2021-06-14 10:03:10,wallstreetbets,You definitely belong here. God speed.
2021-06-14 10:00:58,wallstreetbets,Definitely cuz it’s pump and dump
2021-06-14 16:20:37,wallstreetbets,Well I'm glad I didn't FOMO lol
2021-06-14 19:40:31,wallstreetbets,Anything to get Apes off GameStop
2021-06-14 11:04:36,wallstreetbets,Yup options were a shit decision. I'll eat that one.
2021-06-14 10:27:52,wallstreetbets,Yes the DD just after the stock get pumped to bring FOMO that’s exactly what I thought. Check the price Jan 21th of this year the price went from 37 to 49 before going back to 37 on the same day. This stock is highly manipulated It created a lot of bagholders.
2021-06-14 09:26:30,wallstreetbets,"Buying at open has never done anything but screw me. 

Selling my calls at open has always treated me well"
2021-06-14 09:11:43,wallstreetbets,It might go 45-50 but its risky ahahahahah
2021-06-14 15:04:35,wallstreetbets,Sponsor is not the same as product of choice/popularity.
2021-06-14 15:04:51,wallstreetbets,"Their mice are all G502 type shit, they don't have anything modern that esport players will use or will be recommended by youtubers to kids wanting to get into esports. Keyboards are normal meh gaming stuff but with high price tags. Their headsets are just bad but probably sell as well as anything else because nobody cares about audio. 

Companies like Razer, Ducky, HyperX, Glorious, CoolerMaster and Logitech are all doing much better at making products that competitive gamers actually want to use. Corsair is following in SteelSeries' footsteps."
2021-06-14 16:19:25,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, because there's a gigantic market for computer fans.

I don't know if you're new to the world, but expensive != good and pretty much has nothing to do with the stock price."
2021-06-14 16:36:46,wallstreetbets,"Sorta, they don't manufacture them but they make design decisions."
2021-06-14 17:31:57,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't mean much given the current PC gaming boom caused by lockdowns. I just don't see them following market trends properly. 

I also don't see the elgato acquisition as a good move, most people use software solutions. Nvidia has a streaming encoder built into every RTX card."
2021-06-14 17:16:32,wallstreetbets,Logitech is European and CRSR is American based in the Bay Area. There will be more innovation on corsair.  Though I will not work in hardware for this... sticking to software until more interesting hardware projects come about.

2021-06-14 09:23:45,wallstreetbets,"Your advice is to buy when it's high, but don't go all in. Once it goes higher, that is when you want to go all in?"
2021-06-14 09:23:05,wallstreetbets,"No. ""Apes"" is a term reserved for GME and AMC investors. They created the term. You can't just steal it for any WSB pump and dump. You're the retards"
2021-06-14 13:39:03,wallstreetbets,"I really am, I’ve had good results with it and like the interface"

2021-06-14 12:32:05,wallstreetbets,"Personally I use very high end custom keyboards so I am not the best for office peripherals but in terms of say ram, corsair is hard to beat especially with warranty and driver stuff. Surpassing Logitech doesn't need to be in office stuff, gaming will become bigger and bigger especially in the developing markets."
2021-06-14 11:17:53,wallstreetbets,"Yes, some guy from NIO said it. That's why NIO stock price blowing up over the past month."
2021-06-14 12:17:41,wallstreetbets,CRSR is not taking away from anything.

Eidt. I'll definitely have to check out those headphones, they look sweet."
2021-06-14 18:03:28,wallstreetbets,"Ahh I see, thanks for sharing."
2021-06-14 15:48:47,wallstreetbets,Corsair has the number one position in ram. You don’t know what you’re talking about in any way.
2021-06-14 13:32:19,wallstreetbets,Doubtful. Those people are still going to game even if they do other things.
2021-06-14 12:14:49,wallstreetbets,"I buy their ram too. I order it on my company card every 2 years the latest and greatest. I have 128 GB on my laptop and 2 512 GB on my work desktop. It was actually cheaper than the generic vendor ones and never had an issue like I have with the general company recommended ones.

I meant best for consumer level. I am EE and software engineer so I do order server grade PSUs if I am doing large software defined network projects."

2021-06-14 14:27:22,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at $11 and I’m still holding, It’s my biggest position by far. Honestly makes no sense why that stock is just trading sideways, but I’m ready for when it goes flying."
2021-06-14 12:02:03,wallstreetbets,"Mommy, Daddy, Please stop arguing!!!"
2021-06-14 13:09:17,wallstreetbets,I've only bought headphones from them but they were so uncomfortable that I had to return them. That's my only insight into them.
2021-06-14 11:45:13,wallstreetbets,No it’s overrated but that’s only because people are very easily surprised and pleased by technology they don’t understand
2021-06-14 11:25:37,wallstreetbets,Expensive and doesn’t last longer than EVGA type brands. Which for longevity on any PC part are some of the best.  Corsair just isn’t used much by normal pc gamers.
2021-06-14 17:07:11,wallstreetbets,"They make average-to-slightly below average quality products, slap RGB lights and some streamer faces on the package/website and call it a day. The products aren't **great**, they aren't **bad**, they're just decent value for the price. To say I'll ""Never"" use them is a strong word, but it's true. I will ALWAYS choose to spend a couple hundred more for a better quality product in the end.

RAM, PSU, cases are all fine and dandy, those are whatever. But for sure never touching their peripherals."
2021-06-14 14:03:59,wallstreetbets,"good keyboards, fans, ram etc"
2021-06-14 15:00:37,wallstreetbets,They just rebrand other manufacturers psus. Like half of the PSUs out there are just rebranded seasonics which is not a bad thing necessarily but you may not get the best price for your part
2021-06-14 15:13:14,wallstreetbets,"Cases are amazing, keyboards and mices too, PSUs are the best but there's also mousepads which are great value, i have one and also headsets, i have a HS50 and it's really good, amazing customer support as well

Their ram is also really good, i have a 2x8 3200Mhz kit"
2021-06-14 19:32:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah they hit that midrange market fuckin hard tho
2021-06-14 15:29:58,wallstreetbets,You're at minimum half wrong - which products specifically?
2021-06-14 11:17:15,wallstreetbets,"I'm jelly, I was too busy making morning coffee

lmfao it ended up being a $1k cup of coffee"

2021-06-14 12:29:58,wallstreetbets,"Me too, I have a rule to never trade the first hour. Which I ignored. At least I can tell myself I bought one of those 6/18 50c these apes were selling.  Ya know, gotta keep the money ""local"""
2021-06-14 19:33:42,wallstreetbets,Yikes. Lol yeah I was almost you. I had a tracker alerting me that crsr jumped premarket and I was fiddling around with the options ticker. It started dumping almost immediately at open lol.
2021-06-14 12:24:04,wallstreetbets,"That could describe pretty much every stock on here lately. Not saying that some of don’t have long term value, but in the short term is pump and dump city."
2021-06-14 09:27:03,wallstreetbets,Honestly bomb advice.. I always ignore it and regret not selling

2021-06-14 16:39:09,wallstreetbets,It's a bit sad to see how popular Corsair is when their products are for the most part objectively sub par. Goes to show how far pretty lights will get you.
2021-06-14 17:17:44,wallstreetbets,ok. I'll buy 1 share tomorrow.
2021-06-14 09:27:55,wallstreetbets,"Why, of course, don't you know it? Buy high, sell low! That's also why you set up stop losses in hopes of volatility allowing you to burn even more of that nasty money!"
2021-06-14 10:23:50,wallstreetbets,who the fuck cares loser
2021-06-14 09:33:05,wallstreetbets,Yikes. I wish GME never happened. Ruined this sub.
2021-06-14 13:41:52,wallstreetbets,"hm interesting.  well corsair AIO has best pump in the AIO business, filled to the highest % means less air bubbles and longer life (most likely)."
2021-06-14 19:09:00,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, I do think it's important for people to know the ties between the stocks that are being advertised here and the hedge funds that have a large stake."
2021-06-14 12:53:37,wallstreetbets,Are you big into eSports? I think you might be over estimating the ease at which Corsair can make inroads. Logitech's brand value in this space is insane. Seems like Corsair is following Logitech's strategy of expanding the breadth of the company. But they have an opportunity to become a vertically monopoloy which is really attractive. Logictech is just a peripherial manufacturer.

2021-06-14 19:46:22,wallstreetbets,survivorship bias is a hell of a drug.
2021-06-14 18:04:40,wallstreetbets,"Oh ok. So i just bought a call that has a year on it before it expires,  that would be considered a leap call right ??"
2021-06-14 14:51:06,wallstreetbets,"It’s mainly the chip shortage right now that I think people are hesitant to invest in… Because Corsair has the market share and demand, except last two earning calls they said they haven’t been able to fully fulfill that demand until they can figure out supply chain issues. I’m extremely bullish on CRSR…Even when I was bagholding at $38 cost average, I still felt like it was undervalued."
2021-06-14 13:33:07,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't buy headphones from any ""gaming"" company either. Corsair makes good cases, RAM, AIO coolers, PSUs, fans and such. 

Their peripherals (keyboard, mouse, speakers etc) aren't great."

2021-06-14 11:40:01,wallstreetbets,"I have both evga and corsair parts. Their CPU coolers, RAM, and keyboards are all good. Probably wouldn't buy their mice, but I've owned a corsair PSU and case in the past, which I was happy with. I have an EVGA PSU and GPU now, but corsair is way more diversified in their offerings. The one time I had to contact their support, it was very good.

I don't know where you're getting this ""normal gamers"" bit, most of the people I know with gaming PCs they built themselves have at least one corsair component."
2021-06-14 12:35:57,wallstreetbets,My 750W EVGA PSU just died and I had to replace it after only about a year. I've never had a Corsair power supply die in almost 10 years of having a PC.
2021-06-14 18:57:19,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, what do you go for over Corsair?

I've run a lot of their stuff for years without issues personally."
2021-06-14 18:46:44,wallstreetbets,"Coolermaster case, steelseries keyboard, logitech mouse, hyperx headset all beat Corsair IMO. Still like their range of products though and they kill it with ram and psu"
2021-06-14 15:52:31,wallstreetbets,"There’s better competition in almost every product space they make: cpu coolers, keyboards, mice, I could go on and on. Don’t get me wrong, they don’t make garbage products, but anyone serious about building a robust pc isn’t getting Corsair"

2021-06-14 17:34:04,wallstreetbets,"CoolerMaster and Kingston HyperX sell pretty good headsets. Mostly because they're rebranded from other brands (like Takstar), and are not originally made to be gaming trash."
2021-06-14 13:11:24,wallstreetbets,Corsair is better than it.
2021-06-14 14:31:54,wallstreetbets,"If you are an enthusiast or just really serious about value/performance, you'll know that corsair is not the best brand. Imo they've done a better job than their competitors marketing themselves to their target audience, and that is why they'll remain ahead of their competition. If you can find a good sale on any of their products, you'll still be very happy. 

If you like rgb corsair has the nicest looking rgb hands down and their software is easy to use and customize.  Their customer service is also pretty good. I had to have the front USB panel of my case replaced and all my emails were replied to within 24-36 hours and I was able to get the new part shipped out to me with tracking in 3-4 days.

If you want to get the best value or best performance, there are other brands that are better depending on what you are looking for (fans, ram, power supply, keyboards, mice, etc.). They're not the best in anything but they're decent all around. 

Someone else mentioned El Gato, which they own, and there are much cheaper alternatives to all their products as well (stream deck, capture card) but for the same reasons, I mentioned above, a lot of people will still purchase El Gato products. 

People that have done their research or are really into pc parts know that corsair isn't the best but they have to at least recognize they're still killing it with their intended customer base."
2021-06-14 13:31:33,wallstreetbets,I don’t know depends on the product they make a lot of shit but they’re not the high end for any of it
2021-06-14 18:48:53,wallstreetbets,"Sure, depending on the price range and places you're buying, for me in all those options Corsair was good, hyperx headsets are like 40% more expensive than Corsair ones for close quality. But i agree on mice and keyboards"
2021-06-14 19:54:49,wallstreetbets,No Lian LI case with custom RGB AIO?
2021-06-14 18:24:30,wallstreetbets,"Their cases are boss and their power supplies are very reliable. Elgato are probably one of the most used streaming hardware / software used. Their RAM is great. You are saying you don't like the mice and keyboards to evaluate the company is pretty insane. Feels more like fan Boi remarks. I've got a few corsair components. Got some asrock. Got some nzxt, gskill, Intel, evga. They all have strengths and weaknesses."
2021-06-14 18:47:20,wallstreetbets,Their psus are fantastic wdym
2021-06-14 16:59:04,wallstreetbets,11 year old 750w PSU in my PC indicates otherwise.
2021-06-14 19:27:02,wallstreetbets,"In the 20-10 years ago range Corsair were from my recollection the most trusted name in memory. And starting not too long after they dominated DRAM, the most trusted name in power supplies to power your rig.

This comment makes you seem like a zoomer who has been watching too many advertisements on esports about Chinese brand alternatives, (largely from companies who only popped up in the past decade).

Yes, in current year there is more than one option for building a custom PC that boast high quality, but saying that Corsair doesnt make quality memory or power supplies demonstrates your ignorance. They have probably been Tier 1 in that space longer than you have been alive."

2021-06-14 17:11:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes, these are my sentiments exactly. They've successfully wedged themselves into the gamer market and put all eyes on them by going crazy with sponsorships and branding, which I definitely respect. But ironically, all that does is enforce my belief that their actual peripherals are not great products. As I said before (that kicked off this thread), I will not use their products. But I recognize the direction they're heading, and I won't be afraid of making plays on the stock."
2021-06-14 18:55:04,wallstreetbets,"I’m not gonna get into a debate over pc parts w you cause I really don’t care and some of it is personal taste, but their ram is not great especially when compared to G Skill and their cases aren’t as nice as nzxt"

2021-06-14 18:58:24,wallstreetbets,Again subjective.
2021-06-14 11:39:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah my cost average is like $32 so a $21 gain per share ($18+3) is nothing to cry home about, I'm just a little traumatized from my PTON and ZS covered calls that got exercised last year and then proceeded to triple in share price"
2021-06-14 19:34:22,wallstreetbets,Corsair Ram doesn't identify as bdie ics  it's a gamble with most of their Ram though I would say not worth it
2021-06-14 11:40:59,wallstreetbets,Lol that is trauma. I have the same cost basis (not including maybe $2-3 of expired covered calls I sold)
2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Corsair DD and why it is a growth company in a growth industry First of all, TO THE MOOOOON  🚀  🚀  🚀 

Ok now that we have gotten the basics out of the way time to take a look at Corsair and why I am mega bullish on this stock. 

**Gaming Market**

The gaming market is a strong growing market that has been expanding for the past two decades and is expected to keep growing. Consumer spending in 2020 on PC gaming hardware and accessories reach 4.5 billion USD while accessories [grew 81% YoY and hardware grew 57%.](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-16-pc-hardware-and-accessories-spending-grew-62-percent-in-the-us-in-2020)

Corsair manufactures hardware solutions such as fans, RAM, cooling units, PC cases and many more that have profited from the recent increase in PC hardware sales. Due to lockdowns many have been wanting to buy a PC which has shot up sales. However, this trend is not temporary as I will show. 

[Steam users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/308330/number-stream-users/) a.k.a. any gamer who has a PC and play video games, have seen a very sharp growth in the past year due to the lockdown. The trend fluctuates with the lockdowns easings around the world and is always and bottom in summer months. From August 2019 to August 2020 there has been a 33% increase in steam users. August of 2020 was a time when Europe had record low covid infections (compared to winter months and beginning of pandemic) as well as America. Yet people were still playing video games at record rates. This is a clear sign that this market has grown, and the player base is hooked and not going anywhere. Since then, it had another 20% increase. Bullish af.  

The biggest nonsense I have ever heard is that now that lockdown is over, gamers are going to stop gaming. Have they ever even met a gamer? Personally, I was a hardcore gamer before lockdown, and I will definitely continue to be one. The lockdown accelerated the uptake of gaming and if anything, people will be more committed to gaming. Easing of lockdown would allow for social events (e.g. LAN parties and gaming conventions) to take place that will further encourage spending on gaming products. 

Investors who believe that gaming is going to fade out or that the hype is over are completely in the wrong here. Covid has only accelerated the trend and there might be a minor pullback in numbers as usually happens in the summer months, but the YoY numbers indicate that there has been a strong increase in gaming and this trend is likely to continue. You can buy the stock now at a lucrative price and when the investors realize that gaming is here to stay, they will have to buy the stock at a much higher price down the line.  

**Streaming Market**

An excellent acquisition by Corsair has been buying Elgato and entering the streaming business. The streaming market was 50 billion USD in 2020 and is expected to reach 59 billion USD in 2021. It is expected to continue growing to 2028 at an [annual CAGR rate of 21%!!!](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-streaming-market#:~:text=The%20global%20video%20streaming%20market%20size%20was%20estimated%20at%20USD,USD%2059.14%20billion%20in%202021.&text=The%20global%20video%20streaming%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20grow%20at,USD%20223.98%20billion%20by%202028)

This is a huge market with a wonderful growth rate (not easy finding a market with such a growth rate) and corsair is perfectly positioned to take advantage of it. From buying the hardware to run your PC (also with products such as the capture card) to the elgato streaming deck that allows for easy streaming controls, Corsair is in the perfect position to take advantage of this growing market and be at the forefront of the hardware space. 

**Financial performance**

Absolutely solid financial performance over the past year with stellar growth and very prospective in the future. 

YoY revenue and profit margins have been growing at double digit rates. Revenue grew 55% and 65% from 1,163 and 1,300 to 1,702 and 1,923 million USD from Dec 2019 and March 2020 to Dec 2020 and March 2021. Q1 is usually the worst quarter of the year but they managed to get their best ever quarter!

EBITDA margins and Net Income margins have gone from around 6.5% and 0% to 13.5 and 7.7% from March 2020 to March 2021, respectively. This is showing stunning increase in operating margins which are very healthy and promise great further investment and growth. 

EPS this year is expected to be 1.81. However, the CFO is usually very conservative and it could be much higher by the end of the year. (I could go on more detail about earnings growth but in this case margins are more interesting because it shows better efficiency and last year they were barely doing a profit so the earnings growth is skewed). With an EPS of 1.81 a fair value PE multiple of 20 would be 36.2. However, if you consider this is a growth stock in a growth environment, then comparable growth companies trade at 30-40 PE ratio which would indicate a price target of at least 54.3-72.4!

Additionally, they have been paying down debt from 505 million at end of the year 2019 to 321 million in 2020. 

**Comparing Corsair with its closest competitor: Logitech**

Lets look at Logitech valuation metrics: 

&#x200B;

||Last 12 months|Next 12 months|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio|23.4|30.1|
|EV/Sales|3.8|3.8|
|EV/EBITDA|15.9|22.6|

&#x200B;

Corsair:

||Last 12 months|Next 12 months|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio|20.4|18.8|
|EV/Sales|1.7|1.5|
|EV/EBITDA|11.5|12.9|

&#x200B;

Now if Corsair was priced as Logitech, it would indicate a price increase between 50-100%. 

Additionally, much of Logitech’s offering has been focussed on working from home products, whereas Corsair is more focussed on gaming (Logitech too but not to the same extent). The working from home trend has peaked and many companies like JP Morgan have announced that they will want all their staff to return back to the office within the next months. There will still be people working from home but the trend will be declining from now. 

**Ownership**

There has been negative sentiment around IPOs recently as many of them have flooded the market resulting in extreme short term price movement which has led to investors staying shy of them and believing that they are more speculative. Ownership currently sits at 62% with eagle tree capital and around 10% with other institutions. 

Short interest is currently at around 19% of the float. 

Overall, great company with excellent financial performance (actually makes a great profit and has super good growth ahead) and I am mega bullish on them. They also have super low valuation metrics which together make a rare combination.   
 

**TL;DR**. Great company, great products, growing market and growing company. Super low undervalued. Moon 🚀  🚀  🚀"

2021-06-14 12:55:00,wallstreetbets,"I think you're way overhyping the company and underselling the negatives. There is fierce competition in the market they are trying to improve on.

As a user of Corsair products I can say their hardware has excellent quality, but their software is atrocious. I have quite a few components and none of them work without caveats. Lack of support with other applications, on top of poor drivers, and a poor gui. This is a problem across the board. Asus has much better computer hardware and software, hyperx does better with peripherals."

2021-06-14 12:38:17,wallstreetbets,"So I'm going to play Devil's Advocate here.

Coirsair's key market is peripherals.

Gamers might continue to play games, but you dont need a new mouse or keyboard every 6 months to a year.

If you did, its a shit mouse and you're not buying that brand again. 

As a followup, do you genuinely believe their growth is sustainable? Work from home means peripheral demand had a sharp spike last year. Even IF that demand sustains, I dont believe that translates for more sales, because the sold peripherals still work.

Do ypu genuinely believe a corsair keyboard with pretty LED's is better than a $10 Walmart one? 

There's no material benefit, and if they do have a benefit, it's a market/brand boost, so they need to be compared to a Gucci handbag for gamers vs. a Faux-ci bag.

Brand loyalty is a finicky market and I dont see any evidence Corsair has maintained that kind of luxury flex over ita competitor.

I also dont believe Streaming to be a long term growth industry, if anything, I'd argue its reached market saturation, nor is it super profitable.

Games are fun when played, and generally boring to watch.

Streamers are fun when you can actually interact with the streamer. This means the bigger the streamer gets the less interaction you can have. This cut the margin lower and lower, and we're going to get a situation where Twitch/Youtuber gets the big bucks and only a few big names survive."

2021-06-14 10:14:46,wallstreetbets,"This is solid DD. Not often we see a discussion of the metrics and comparable companies. That said, calling a retail company a growth company is asinine.

2021-06-14 08:42:50,wallstreetbets,"If you believe in gaming, look at $SLGG, which I think has a ton of growth ahead. I don’t think it’s WSB meme material, but e-sports market is very hot, yet small."

2021-06-14 10:58:36,wallstreetbets,"As few people have mentioned - Corsair have an excellent reputation for their components.

What I find more interesting is what else they're doing. They already sold systems, but recently bought Origin - so are clearly looking to move up the food chain.

More interesting though, is what they've done with their Corsair One Line. These are no compromise powerful PCs, in a very compact form factor - and sold for a healthy premium.  
As far as I can see, they've got this niche to themselves. 

Plenty of companies selling RBG monstrosities for 'gamers', some companies like Puget creating validated workstations - but the Corsair Ones are that sweet spot for the ""grown up gamer with cash"", who wants something that they don't have to hide out of shame.  
(Basically the people who would buy Apple, but they want to game)"

But in regards to sole video game companies or manufactures, I've struggled. NVDIA is too much, but a future stock split will help. EA to ATVI have some appeal, but personally they suck balls, and they are notorious at fucking up. TTWO only has Rockstar lately, and while GTA Online is a money maker, no ideas right now. 

That said, I didn't realize Corsair is being traded! I like their products. I have a power supply in my old rig, and own their mouse and keyboard. Reliable stuff at reasonable prices."

Corsair people are very loyal as all their gear works together and syncs together.

> I also dont believe Streaming to be a long term growth industry, if anything, I'd argue its reached market saturation, nor is it super profitable.

Wrong again.

In reality, Corsair products are fairly average in the market and have gimmicks like lots of RGB lights on them. In just about every category they compete in the hyped up astroturfing overrides the reality of the product.

This doesn't necessarily mean Corsair is a bad investment but beware that the customer sentiment you're seeing online about the company is about as real as the average fake Amazon review."

2021-06-14 13:13:02,wallstreetbets,"Regarding expensive peripherals, human response time is 250 ms. A typical keyboard has a response time of <5 ms.

I find it highly suspect to believe that Corsair has some kind of magical technical benefit of their keyboard/mouse tech over their competitors.

Let's also be honest professional gamer is a tiny market. Nike doesnt make its money selling to the Chicago Bulls. It uses Michael Jordon's foot as a billboard. Likewise Corsair's revenue was $175 billionin peripherals. It didnt make that money off pros. It made it off enthusiasts that want to be like pros.

What could be real, is if they have some brand benefit, like Nike shoes vs generic shoes, or other lixury brand good.

I'm not convinced Corsair peripherals are the Air Jordons of shoes. 

Even if they are, consumers are notoriously fickle about ""in"" brands. And keyboards/mice dont have ""I'm rich/cool"" flex that shoes, cars or handbags do. If they do, I'm way out of the loop.

So... how many people can be convinced for a Corsair logo and red LED's on their mouse? 

I'm looking at Coirsairs SEC filing, and it looks like their not directly monetizing streaming, but selling periphals under a ""streamer"" marketing label. They spent a small 1.7 million to buy software they sell for $5 for stream plugins. Its not a major part of their income stream, and considering quality free offerings are available I dont see that changing soon.

In summary, I think Corsair is... fine. But 2019's numbers are more realistic than 2020's."
2021-06-14 17:10:42,wallstreetbets,"If you genuinely believe that Corsair has a brand moat that gives them a competitive advantage over Razer, Logitech, and the hundreds of random brands, then feel free to ride this rocket.

I'll be the first the admit that I could be off my rocker, but I don't see anything in this DD or Corsair's business plan that addresses this.

Looks like the biggest pump and dump wave has passed and CRSR is up ~12% from Friday instead of its 30% peak today."

Gskill makes goodram but thats it.  PSUs are pretty much interchangeable as long as you don't go for the cheapest lowest graded ones.  Cases are very subjective since a lot of it's desire is aesthetics but even then, price matters alot and many cases look very similar to each other: I'm relatively certain most people sort by form factor then color and then price.  And the other issue is that doing well in one category doesn't make you do well in the others. It's not like Apple and its attempt to create a sticky environment. If you have a mac, iphone, and iwatch, the hardware and software all work well together.  Imagine having a Mac, Android, and a Fossil smartwatch."

The company’s shares closed last Friday at $609.89.

According to [TipRanks.com](https://www.tipranks.com/?ref=SA), Dorsheimer is a 5-star analyst with an average return of **30.0%** and a 54.4% success rate. Dorsheimer covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Stmicroelectronics, Fuelcell Energy, and IPG Photonics.

Currently, the analyst consensus on Tesla is a Hold with an average price target of $632.10, implying a 3.6% upside from current levels. In a report issued on June 3, Morgan Stanley also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $900.00 price target.

The company has a one-year high of $900.40 and a one-year low of $181.70. Currently, Tesla has an average volume of 30.17M.

Based on the recent corporate insider activity of 67 insiders, corporate insider sentiment is positive on the stock. This means that over the past quarter there has been an increase of insiders buying their shares of TSLA in relation to earlier this year.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"OSCR Health insurance technologies is undervalued as it recovers from all-time low (DD) **tl;dr: OSCR will go the moon soon, just so they can deny the man on the moon’s insurance claim**

## A distressed company: Is the cure worse than the disease?

Oscar Health’s core business is as old as the American Dream itself: deny poor people medical care, and then bill them for the privilege. Oscar adds a fun twist to this winning formula by using technology to deny insurance requests faster and more frequently than traditional companies, which require actual human representatives to decide whether deaf children are allowed to have hearing aids.

Founded in 2012 by current CEO Mario Schlosser, Kevin Nazemi, and Josh Kushner (brother of sentient wax doll Jared Kushner), Oscar Health provides health insurance with a particular technological emphasis. Unlike other providers in the space, OSCR cuts costs by emphasizing telemedicine, automated referrals, and remote prescriptions \[1,2\].

OSCR IPO’d at $39 in March, and almost immediately plummeted to the mid-20’s, where it’s been fluctuating ever since. OSCR’s IPO went so poorly that at least one law firm is considering a class-action suit for securities fraud on behalf of investors \[3\].

## Signs of life

Like many early-stage companies entering an entrenched industry, Oscar initially burned money faster than a secret service agent at a luxury golf course: in 2016 the company lost $204.9 million, while in 2017 the company lost $83 million. However, as the company has expanded its subscriber base and adjusted its risk calculations, it has begun to turn around: in 2018, OSCR posted profits of $1 billion from 400,000 subscribers, and in 2021 it is expected to bring in $2 billion \[4\].

Moreover, OSCR has relatively little competition in its space. Similar startups like Collective Health and WSB’s sweaty dakimakura Clover Health have substantially fewer subscribers and have struggled to turn a profit \[5\]. Meanwhile, larger players in the insurance industry like Anthem are full of polo-shirt thumb-typers, leading to mishaps when they have tried to integrate new technology into their existing offerings \[6\].

Moreover, OSCR has a reputation for poaching top tech talent from companies like Microsoft and Amazon, and Google has even invested in the company.

I am bullish because OSCR has several unique advantages over comparable companies:

## The Bone Saw Gambit

In 2021, companies throughout the world are reckoning with the ethical implications of taking on unscrupulous investment partners. From severing ties to the Chinese government, to removing board members with histories of harassment, corporations worldwide are defining a new approach to vetting investors that will likely restructure the nature of the venture capital space for years to come.

But not Oscar Health. These chads and chadtoinettes will take money from anyone who offers them a nickel and half-kilo of Paradise White. Just last year, OSCR closed a $165 million financing round shortly after co-founder Josh Kushner and Jared Kushner visited Saudi Arabia and met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, everyone’s favorite journalist-murdering oligarch \[7\].

## Daddy’s Money

The renowned Chicago school of economics is a neoclassical school of economic thought based on post-Keynesian monetary theory. Over the decades, one guiding axiomatic principle has emerged from this storied institution:

RICH. KIDS. CAN’T. FAIL.

Due to co-founder Josh Kushner’s involvement, OSCR has its own insurance policy I the form of being intimately intertwined with the Kushner family. Patriarch Charles Kushner alone has an estimated net worth of \~$2 billion, giving him plenty of runway to bail out his son as needed:

* Earnings underwater because we blew all our VC money on coke and legal settlements?Emergency cash injection from Papa.
* Our machine learning algorithm stopped running because our Office 365 free trial expired?Bailout from El Padre.

2021-06-14 09:22:50,wallstreetbets,"That was funny. 

So your DD is that the company's business are perfecting being horrible and cannot fail because it's run by a bunch of rich white kids without scruples, including the dude who managed to bag Karlie Kloss? 

Sounds good to me actually. I'm in."

2021-06-14 08:13:12,wallstreetbets,"This is worst DD as Oscar is not in distress. You will realize how awesome it is when not try to book an appointment with a specialist when you have a  platinum and get the runaround! They are the real deal unlike the Clover scam
Long 300, think this a very long term play."
2021-06-14 09:47:16,wallstreetbets,"lmao, the first source I look at (4), was for 2020, not 2021, and it failed miserably.  


If the first thing I check is a massive lie, I'm kindda scared to check more."
2021-06-14 10:18:29,wallstreetbets,I did the same rationale with D0ge. My first dog was a shiba named wolfey from that fact alone i bought in.. Making out like a bandit ever since.. Rock on buddy

2021-06-14 07:53:15,wallstreetbets,Can't believe I thought it was a good deal to buy at 30. I shouldn't be allowed to trade.

2021-06-14 08:29:36,wallstreetbets,"Fucking RIDE, man. Fortunately, I had the balls to sell when I was only 23% down"
2021-06-14 07:45:53,wallstreetbets,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
2021-06-14 10:24:07,wallstreetbets,Bullish AF
2021-06-14 07:55:59,wallstreetbets,Aren't they being sued currently?
2021-06-14 07:58:23,wallstreetbets,"Ahh, the ol NKLA Milton strategy."
2021-06-14 09:15:43,wallstreetbets,I think someone posted on Friday that they will rocket because they will start production in September and GM won’t let them fail.
2021-06-14 12:07:10,wallstreetbets,"For all the long time WSB autists who still bought in despite the obvious warning signs of fraud, you were warned and you're getting what you deserved"

2021-06-14 07:41:42,wallstreetbets,"🪦 rip $RIDE, maybe they should’ve tried cow fart propulsion $CLNE 🐄🚀"
2021-06-14 09:22:41,wallstreetbets,I really don’t know how people invest. Making a pickup trucks is an over saturated industry with some of the established bad boys already in it. Tesla is probably the only new EV company I’d invest. Ford and GM already have control over the pickup market and they moving in on hard on these EV pickups so I really don’t know what Lordstown was doing there. This is an easy put play with little to no DD. My price target is $5!
2021-06-14 08:11:22,wallstreetbets,RIP
2021-06-14 09:29:05,wallstreetbets,"Tried posting DD criticizing the company last week, but mods apparently were only allowing positive DD for RIDE last week."

2021-06-14 10:48:18,wallstreetbets,So glad i sold at 14 last week. Was even getting fomo when it hit 16
2021-06-14 12:11:33,wallstreetbets,Watch as GM hoovers up shares as everyone bails and acquires their old plant back for pennies along with any patents and IP in the processes. Send a few big brains from detroit in to sort out the electric issues. One slick marketing campaign later featuring AC/DC and boom! Chevy Amp 1500 EUV
2021-06-14 08:36:32,wallstreetbets,"Next up: Arrival, Canoo, Hylion.   


Later: Nikola.   


Much later: wave upon wave of SPACS. Toxic garbage.   


Fisker & Lucid: probably get out alive."

2021-06-14 14:39:59,wallstreetbets,Youngstown can't catch a break.
2021-06-14 10:45:02,wallstreetbets,Have you heard the CEO in interviews. He sounds like an idiot. On top of this it was pretty clear he was fired for better management. Say what you will about Lordstown but this is a good thing. (The CFO too)
2021-06-14 09:13:28,wallstreetbets,"Remember when people tried to make Lordstown happen last week and some people actually rotated out of the promising plays into this?

I remember getting slewn when I talked about it being too high risk for me right now."
2021-06-14 08:19:48,wallstreetbets,Well that was quite the RIDE while it lasted…
2021-06-14 08:35:06,wallstreetbets,Their tour later this week are gonna be parents and Tigerbeat magazine
2021-06-14 10:36:06,wallstreetbets,We tried to tell you boys.  This one was clear as day.  Hope yall get out with whats left before it goes to 0.  These guys have nothing.
2021-06-14 10:42:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm so lucky my cc's were called in the last spike. 


Too bad though for the company though"
2021-06-14 11:11:52,wallstreetbets,There were a couple of hilarious pump posts after they said they were probably bankrupt last week.
2021-06-14 11:12:38,wallstreetbets,"My calls were finally printing last week .. This is why I can't have nice thing. Ah well, puts are just as good."
2021-06-14 11:16:19,wallstreetbets,It's like that Futurama episode with 80's guy. If only he didn't have boneitis!
2021-06-14 11:26:07,wallstreetbets,Dogshit gonna dogshit
2021-06-14 12:01:06,wallstreetbets,so watch the price tank and then buy and hold or...
2021-06-14 12:15:27,wallstreetbets,I never heard of these guys until recently. Am I the only one?
2021-06-14 16:47:00,wallstreetbets, wait for ride to bleed out then somehow it rises from the dead via gay lords force?
2021-06-14 18:04:45,wallstreetbets,I don't understand how electric cars are supposed to come into existence without a plan to make batteries.

""Uh we never said we had orders"""
2021-06-14 09:19:51,wallstreetbets,Lmao I told and warned you idiots
2021-06-14 11:51:51,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes I wonder if bears just argue with themselves. One of the key points they had was how poor a CEO Burns was for LMC. The other was the Hindenburg report. Both were addressed today.

What’s the problem?

I’m beginning to think that change scares bears more than losing money."
2021-06-14 13:00:44,wallstreetbets,"Rocky times indeed but today's news was, in many ways, good.    

1) The hindi report only got 1 thing right - the pre-orders.   

2) they got everything else wrong (hub motors, production, etc.)    

3) Many wanted Burns to step down.

For the non believers in RIDE & their leadership, this is good."
2021-06-14 09:40:33,wallstreetbets,I was just in Lordstown and got a ticket for going 78 in a 40. So many cops out this weekend. Fuck that place.

2021-06-14 17:10:39,wallstreetbets,"Ouch. In this case, the shorts might have had good reason... Not all highly shorted stocks are worth a shot lol.

AMC and CLOV to the moon! GME too, obviously. And maybe WKHS (I'm just dabbling with that last one)."

2021-06-14 08:54:13,wallstreetbets,So electric car stocks are as useful as electric cars currently are?
2021-06-14 10:09:15,wallstreetbets,I was in at an average of 16 and out at 12 and I have no regrets. What a dumpster
2021-06-14 10:32:58,wallstreetbets,I wonder how the “RIDE open discussion” guy will explain how this is either a lie or a good catalyst for the company
2021-06-14 10:39:25,wallstreetbets,Just the first one to go $RMO  $NKLA $WKHS won't be far behind on their way to zero
2021-06-14 10:54:54,wallstreetbets,"This is a real gut punch for everyone involved, they really should have got their heads out of their asses a couple years ago and done what was necessary to at least make this thing viable.    Fucking idiots.   All people have to do is believe in you, and you can print money with this shit - now people wouldn't even feed you shit if you were starving."
2021-06-14 10:59:17,wallstreetbets,I wonder if they symbolically jumped out of a moving prototype during their announcement.

2021-06-14 09:57:49,wallstreetbets,"Great state of Delaware gave millions to Fisker to buy a former GM plant & make cars here, never happened. It is now a giant Amazon fulfillment center. We also gave millions to help some politically connected dude develop a french fry vending machine. BIG BIG brains running this state, lol."

2021-06-14 08:13:20,wallstreetbets,I bought NKLA at $50 and finally sold at $20.

I´m green since then"
2021-06-14 07:55:45,wallstreetbets,I am in at 9.99 and can’t wait to see how toast the company is going to be today.  Ugh.
2021-06-14 08:52:54,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if you're looking at the price of a company while literally the entire company has just been outed as a fraud you're in for trouble. Lordstown/Nikola would still be expensive at $0.1..."

2021-06-14 09:44:46,wallstreetbets,"I did buy them, and then the lying cunt said they ""were close to securing more investment"" and the price spiked and stayed above my strike. I wake up to this shit...

Grrrr.....

Also, please see the short, off Broadway play called ""Fuck NKLA."""

2021-06-14 12:14:03,wallstreetbets,NKLA stock is currently rising. Im not sure what point your trying to make
2021-06-14 09:58:48,wallstreetbets,"CEO's work history is literally ""I start companies get investors to dump money in and hope someone buys it out because I have no intention or experience with managing to the point where we need to produce functional products."

2021-06-14 13:37:23,wallstreetbets,"Are you glad because it’s down, or do you think this will never recover?"
2021-06-14 09:09:21,wallstreetbets,"Well Fisker only has Website development costs to deal with so far, so they might be around for some time till they actually decide to make vehicle and burn their cash."

The fuck man, what have I done to you?"
2021-06-14 09:13:46,wallstreetbets,Stay away from my PSFE. He's precious to me.
2021-06-14 08:35:57,wallstreetbets,Less capital and a management team that wasn't nearly as effective at pumping the stock on bullshit would be my guess. And now they're down two more senior execs. It's companies like this that *are* legitimate short targets.
2021-06-14 09:05:13,wallstreetbets,"1. Chances are they are never getting to production before they go bankrupt
2. Even if they do get to production, who will buy a truck from them over Ford (you know what do you do about service down the line)
3. Even their first-mover advantage (assuming they get to production) is pretty meaningless as until you get to sufficient volume you are burning cash.

In any case, GREAT NEWS, for those invested in RIDE. Steve Burns is making a new EV company that will make a Pickup truck with in-wheel motors and batteries (so no need for wires!) and is getting that ATVM loan any day. Lol...

For Nikola at least, even if the demo was a sham, H2 is not fairy dust and seems it can be commercialized. The bigger issue I have with H2 is that it is too inefficient and BEV's are better. But will not get into that here."
2021-06-14 07:40:49,wallstreetbets,IMO this company has been a train wreck since the start. You can get lucky on a trade but I think just about any other company is a better place to invest
2021-06-14 08:33:18,wallstreetbets,"Get out while the ship is still above water. Between their prototype catching fire, artificially inflated order numbers, Ford releasing the Lightning, and the execs pretty much saying ""it's not happening"", I don't see this company making a comeback."
2021-06-14 07:55:33,wallstreetbets,It boggles my mind that out of all the other EV companies $ride is the one people are willing to bet on... They’ve been frauds from the beginning.
2021-06-14 10:02:00,wallstreetbets,Current CEO has zero experience managing a real company so not hard to do better but very hard to dig out of the hole they are in.  They have very little chance of beating Ford to market in a substantial way and there is little reason to choose them over Ford.
2021-06-14 10:53:23,wallstreetbets,"He was a shady dude and probably gave the worlds worst interview on CNBC. Agree he needed to go.

But timing is pretty terrible here. They need to be executing on their production, not looking for a new CEO/CFO now. If they don’t get to production soon, they will never have a chance in hell to compete with Ford."
2021-06-14 11:29:33,wallstreetbets,I’ve been shitting on RIDE for a while now because they deserve it but I constantly get flak for it.  People are fucking stupid.

2021-06-14 11:24:19,wallstreetbets,That's the thing though. I don't think they would fire them if they didn't have candidates in mind. And I'm sure GM has plenty of very knowledgeable people that would love to be a CEO and center of attention.

2021-06-14 12:55:40,wallstreetbets,Very true. I try pointing this out that TSLA shareholders were very tolerant of the multiple rounds of fund raising and the constant threat of going bankrupt in order to support Elon's vision. Not sure someone coming along trying to copy Tesla will ever find that level of support again.

I had a limit order for a July put this morning, and canceled because people are retardedly married to this stock (and I was lowballing the price anyway). When they announce a new CEO, I think it might actually fucking spike again."

2021-06-14 16:15:13,wallstreetbets,"Huge potential for 
- big energy storage (think for countries)
- home energy storage / solar
- AI: autobidder software, fsd, renting out dojo
- If someone will realize a global autonomous taxi fleet in the next 10 years, I’m putting 90% chance on it being Tesla, and they actually also produce the cars
- Tesla semi, roadster and cybertruck coming
- car software (think apps, fsd, netflix, the spaceX internet, etc). 
- batteries and drive chain technology 
- The cross-selling of it all. Someone who buys a Tesla will help improve AI, will more likely buy Tesla solar, maybe slap some starlink on it, etc
- On this point, tesla insurance. All teslas are equiped with cameras, vehicle tracking and theres plenty of statistics that Teslas are by far both the safest vehicles as well as the vehicles with the least accidents per mile driven (excluding non-daily drivers)
- A monopoly at talent who are willing to work hard for little pay. Best fad AI expert? Working at tesla. Best rocket engineers? Working at spaceX. Best battery people? Tesla.
- just plain manufacturing. Not building some hundred thousand cars, but manufacturing millions on a gigantic Factario scale combined with access to literal rocket engineers who will design new materials and production techniques for you. This combined with inhouse manufacturing and limited varieties (meaning you can build a very optimized car in gigantic quantities) means way better profit margins (20-25% margin now, aiming for 40%) than any competitor. Tesla is internally guiding to grow 50% a year in production, up to 20 million cars a year and actually have the roadmap to back it up

There’s probably more. This list grows every goddamn year and it all fits together brilliantly. By the time backwards looking analysis people figure it out, they will not inderstand what will happen the year after.

Final note: they are fresh and the only company who can make a profit on EVs. They don’t have sunk costs on ICE technology. They don’t need to transition from a dealership model. They don’t need a cultural transition or get rid of their boomer personnel with decades of experience in  old technology. 

Just to illustrate, Tesla is world leading in everything I listed above."

2021-06-14 10:22:48,wallstreetbets,CEO just said on CNBC that it is effective on the Delta!!!
2021-06-14 12:07:52,wallstreetbets,There is no mention in any article about its Delta efficacy. Most MSM points out its efficacy is measured against the alpha variant. A variant we stopped fighting six months ago. That article was nothing but a puff piece to stop people from being concerned. To make sure people just keep going to work and getting out and spending money. There is not a DOCTOR out there that is not concerned about the Delta variant.

2021-06-14 07:37:46,wallstreetbets,I am sitting out vaccine plays. But good luck.
2021-06-14 07:21:16,wallstreetbets,They have contracts with countries all over the world for more than a billion doses and that’s before you start talking about boosters. It’s the safest vaccine and the company is on pace for producing 150 million doses per month by end of Q3. They also have demonstrably better flu vaccine than Sanofi according to trial data and that could be added to their covid vaccine. They’re the only company that did a full scale US trial while variants were present. The have the highest demonstrated efficacy. They are actually very undervalued right now. They should be trading in the 700’s in the next few months.
2021-06-14 07:05:05,wallstreetbets,They also have a malaria vaccine in the works.  It would be life changing.
2021-06-14 07:09:10,wallstreetbets,Going over $300
2021-06-14 07:57:22,wallstreetbets,I believe you are solely looking at the price and not market cap of its competitors with similar efficacy rates.
2021-06-14 09:29:19,wallstreetbets,Biden also made it soar a few days before just by mentioning it on tv. Then he fucked it all up
2021-06-14 10:22:04,wallstreetbets,What happened? I'm not understanding wtf is going on.
2021-06-14 09:48:11,wallstreetbets,"But covering should make price go up not down, im so confused"
2021-06-14 11:27:23,wallstreetbets,Markets are bad today and might be priced in a bit. I was hoping for a better run up before it fell like this so I could take decent profit and then get back in. But my stop loss triggered and only ended up with minimal profit. Don't know if I'll get back in unless it drops below 200.
2021-06-14 14:19:47,wallstreetbets,baaaaaa
2021-06-14 08:17:59,wallstreetbets,Bought it for nanoflu. Dumb luck on the pandemic. One of my relatives bought 10k shares at $5 and is still diamond handing.
2021-06-14 11:42:46,wallstreetbets,"I bought at $0.3ish well before the split around June 2019 because I am retarded and I noticed they were in the same city that I grew up in.
Held for all that time and sold at $120 on for a $6k profit, 24 hours before they rocketed to $300+ to buy GME at $150 which i then proceeded to sell at $40."

They might just have less loops to jump thru since they are already doing studies in the Us n shit

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC Mad show recap 
 In his ""Executive Decision"" segment, Cramer spoke with Matt Ishbia, chairman and CEO of UWM Holdings  (UWMC) - Get Report, the mortgage broker that today announced an ambitious plan to become the No. 1 lender by 2024, a position currently held by Rocket Companies  (RKT) - Get Report. UWM shares responded by rallying 5.8% by the close and currently trade for 11 times earnings with a 4% yield.

 CEO said his ""called shot"" today stems from the results the company has been able to deliver and confidence in the future of their business. When you're able to close loans fast and make the process painless for buyers, people want to use you, he said, and that's exactly what UWM is seeing.
When asked about the recent declines in their stock, Ishbia said that UWM got lumped in with other companies, like Rocket, but in reality, UWM is forecasting growth, not weakness. They're not a cyclical stock, he added.
When asked why he's so confident in his growth, Ishbia said simply that UWM dominates the mortgage brokerage market but that market only accounts for 25% of all mortgages. Just growing their piece of the pie to 30% or 35% will translate into big gains."

2021-06-14 09:07:27,wallstreetbets,The UWMC stocks are palantiring in my portfolio for a long time. I bought them at 12$... Just can wait to sell them and my more AMC positions!!!

Lekker bezig trouwens, heb zelf 5000 @ $7"
2021-06-14 13:56:12,wallstreetbets,"Ja dit is degiro ja, lekker man, vond het te aantrekkelijk rond de	$7"
2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Been in Uwmc for a few months. Still not selling. 
2021-06-14 06:55:39,wallstreetbets,I like UWMC! Got in last week on the dip and will likely increase my position today
2021-06-14 06:51:53,wallstreetbets,I see a lot of money in your future
2021-06-14 06:25:44,wallstreetbets,69%
2021-06-14 06:56:53,wallstreetbets,Going to be a nice green week for all of us.
2021-06-14 09:56:55,wallstreetbets,"I'm feeling it this week. Putting some money into this week's calls.

  There's huge Open Interest for this week. 230K calls vs 30K puts. If we see $11 and above we might see a small rally."
2021-06-14 09:29:21,wallstreetbets,Same. Got in at 8.08
2021-06-14 11:14:22,wallstreetbets,When moon?

2021-06-14 09:34:28,wallstreetbets,same...a little less green on my screen tho
2021-06-14 14:46:05,wallstreetbets,$UWMC looking good for an uphill accelerated blast off.
2021-06-14 18:25:41,wallstreetbets,"I’m holding for life at this point. 

1) people always need mortgages 
2) solid fundamentals and revenue should continue to increase 
3) great management team
4) fantastic dividend yield. 

Let’s go UWMC 🚀🎉"
2021-06-14 09:24:05,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-14 07:12:04,wallstreetbets,"I mean with options like that, I wouldn’t sell UWMC either"
2021-06-14 09:18:06,wallstreetbets,This is a good stock. Only selling if it gets overvalued to then  buy back again... Currently it does not appear to be overvalued.
2021-06-14 08:50:45,wallstreetbets,"Had $0 a few months ago, so was only able to scrape together enough for 1 $10 08/20 call. Should have built up enough cash to do the buy by then."
2021-06-14 09:46:30,wallstreetbets,Me too and have the same percentage returns but a lot less money 😆
2021-06-14 09:47:59,wallstreetbets,What does this company do?
2021-06-14 12:32:31,wallstreetbets,Looks fake
2021-06-14 14:14:34,wallstreetbets,I haven’t been able to get in. I had a bunch of leaps I closed because my short leg was blown and I’ve been running atm csps since $7 keep having to close them and reissue. Good problem to have I think I’ve made $4 share in premiums so far.
2021-06-14 15:13:05,wallstreetbets,I literally cant sell cause im still at a loss. Tricked by Gores LOL 🤣
2021-06-14 10:48:44,wallstreetbets,Checking in with my single Jul 16th $11 C 😎😈
2021-06-14 13:25:17,wallstreetbets,bruh I should have kept those leaps
2021-06-14 14:34:56,wallstreetbets,"I bought the dip today at $10.13.  Market maker trying real hard to keep these options out of the money, a little more momentum and this thing could rip up that gamma ramp"
2021-06-14 08:23:59,wallstreetbets,I’ve heard rumors Wall Street Beta is going to get behind our stock and push it!
2021-06-14 06:45:20,wallstreetbets,I sold as soon as it went over $10. Held it for 6 looooooong months.
2021-06-14 09:01:15,wallstreetbets,This comment section is all bots
2021-06-14 11:29:20,wallstreetbets,Picked up what I could on my limited budget hoping to have a larger budget for my next purchase.  Lets see what I can do with my measly 36 shares lol
2021-06-14 07:03:14,wallstreetbets,It’s going to be a fun ride. Goodluck this week!
2021-06-14 06:54:09,wallstreetbets,was 'bout to ask why sell if it pays nice dividents lol
2021-06-14 06:54:15,wallstreetbets,When is the exdividend date?
2021-06-14 09:25:37,wallstreetbets,First one is Wells Fargo
2021-06-14 09:53:32,wallstreetbets,It makes you money 🚀💰
2021-06-14 09:37:18,wallstreetbets,push it real good
2021-06-14 08:36:34,wallstreetbets,This was not smart.
2021-06-14 08:50:36,wallstreetbets,"I made the mistake of selling my AMC at $18 after buying at $13 and holding for 5 months.  I'm not going to make the same mistake again.

I bought UWMC 3 months ago at $9.16 and and planned to sell as soon as it hit $10.  I'm going to hold on longer this time."
2021-06-14 06:53:51,wallstreetbets,Nah this is a buy at 10 bro
2021-06-14 10:28:54,wallstreetbets,"but not you, right?"
2021-06-14 10:50:33,wallstreetbets,Says the 50 day account. That’s gold 😂
2021-06-14 08:43:09,wallstreetbets,It's pretty much the only stock talked about on this sub that actually pays a dividend.
2021-06-14 07:15:43,wallstreetbets,couple days ago.  It pays July 6 i believe but you had to hold it June 9
2021-06-14 13:57:58,wallstreetbets,Fine where is the casino then
2021-06-14 17:01:20,wallstreetbets,Aaaaaaaaaand I bought it o\_O
2021-06-14 07:53:09,wallstreetbets,Nah at $10 this is a goodbye 🤣
2021-06-14 11:44:21,wallstreetbets,"Guess you’ll need to decide, but I clicked on like five different comments that sounded robotic and they were all about 130-150 day old accounts."
2021-06-14 11:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Excuse me, 51 days 😉"
2021-06-14 09:26:29,wallstreetbets,"did you see the premarket? Some strength, who knows if it holds

20 some odd percent short"
2021-06-14 12:05:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m seeing that with every flavor of comment in every ticker. a lot of people jumped into the market (or at least the meme market) in the last 4-5 months, you’d think most would want to keep their finances separate from their regular shit posting.

hard to argue against the idea that wsb has a bot problem, though"

2021-06-14 17:36:51,wallstreetbets,"**Abstract**

If you are specifically targeting stocks to **force** shorts to close, you should be targeting stocks with shorts in WEAK positions.

High SI% of FF is not enough to force shorts to close.  There are plenty with extremely high SI% (WKHS being one of them) where the *majority* of shorts are not in danger of becoming unprofitable.

I will break down existing CLOV short interest in the following subsection and why CLOV is in a prime spot **assuming future upward momentum**.

I will not entertain any ideas of hidden shorts / synthetic shares and **solely** look at reported and Ortex estimated numbers.

Also I like the stock.
____

[Current SI% of FF and CLOV Chart as of 6/14/2021](https://i.imgur.com/BZXWirM.png)

Per the link above, CLOV has an Ortex estimated SI of **49.37M shares** of 112M shares of free float. (~44% SI% of FF).
____
**Short Strength Breakdown**

1) CLOV became CLOV in the week of June 8th, 2020 at the price of $10 and since then and January 29th, 2021, the price has ranged from **~$10 and $17.45**.

The second datapoint of exchange reported shorts stated there were **12.7M shares short as of January 29th, 2021**.

For a worst case scenario, we will **assume all 12.7M shares short were opened at $17.45**

2) Between January 29th, 2021 and February 12th, 2021, an exchange reported SI increase of 7.1M shares were reported with the price of CLOV ranging from **$11.75 and $14.70**.

For a worst case scenario, we will **assume all 7.1M shares short were opened at $14.70**.

3) From February 12th, 2021 and May 20th, 2021, an exchange reported SI increase of 21.3M shares were reported with the price of CLOV ranging from **$6.50 and $12.39**.

For a worst case scenario, we will **assume all 21.3M shares short were opened at $12.39**

4) Since then, Ortex estimates an increase of 8.2M shares short.  The price since May 20th to now has obviously gone through a rollercoaster so we'll just assume that these 8.2M shorts opened at the high of $27.

**Table Breakdown**



Date Range | Price Opened (Assumed)| Share Amount
---|---|----
6/8/2020 - 1/29/2021 | $17.45 | 12.7M
1/29/2021 - 2/12/2021| $14.70| 7.1M
2/12/2021 - 5/20/2021| $12.39| 21.3M
5/20/2021 - 6/14/2021| $27.00 | 8.2M

____

**Conclusions**

Using the data above, it can be seen that the a good handful of shorts (43%) are underwater by **at least** 20%, a small handful of shorts (14%) are **at most** break even or underwater, and the remaining 43% of shorts are ""healthy"" and in no danger of needing to be closed.

**Assuming a future continuation of upward price action, CLOV is uniquely positioned (compared to other memestocks) to force shorts to close with a combination of high SI% of *weak shorts*, low market cap, and a moderately higher Cost to Borrow.**

This also does not even consider the approximately **20M shares of ITM call options (if the price of CLOV hits above $20 by 6/18)** and even more if including 7/16s.

___

Before the non-idiots go berserk because this assumes that shares short did not close and re-open during the run-up to $27, look, I understand that, but utilization has run near 100% since the jump to $27 and Ortex did not report any absurdly high share returns after the major pump.

Also, assuming worst case (highest) short opening price should offset the difference in a close and a re-open to a stronger position. 

___

**Miscellaneous**

I hold a good handful of CLOV 7/16 calls.

No, out of all of the memestocks discussed on WSB, literally none of them have the same setup as CLOV.  All other memestocks have either a low SI%, a large amount of shorts already closed, or the shorts are majority-wise healthy.

Also I like the stock"

 love this stock for the future but today we seen a heavy short attack nearly 600 million plus last time I checked being shorted this week. More short volume than actual fuckin buying because amc is hot. Don't get discouraged if anything load up on shares. Stop playing options until the float is eaten more. 43% owned by insiders. Haha do the math people. This is a winner all around. G7 cybersecurity biggest concern. Who is #1 growing and backed by 
$AMZN
 and 
$MSFT
 deals haha one good news from Chen and shorts are fucked. Still quiet on 
$FB
 settlement but word on the street it is anywhere from 5 to 10 billion so let that sink in.  This isn't going anywhere. Let then short the float and when they cover as float gets eaten we rise. Easy as that. stop being a bitch 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌝"

CLOV is a reasonable price and has room for significant growth based on its product alone.

BB 🚀ing to the 🌝

Here's why:

https://imgur.com/gallery/kHNetoF"
2021-06-14 08:27:44,wallstreetbets,"The truth of why some stocks rise, rocket or moon. I’m not a professional trader. 
But in my opinion most stocks swing on sentiment..
Yup feelings….
Good fundamentals, bad fundamentals.  Don’t matter sometimes.  Just stupid feelings.   Like fear.  Over exuberance. Demand and lack their of demand and the feeling of being left behind or the feeling of being left holding the bag.  

And it’s alright. A good feeling might make you buy a stock and maybe that feeling is rooted in over enthusiasm and good fundamentals.  A bad feeling might make you sell a stock for the opposite reasons.  
I was gonna make this post longer but I forget y’all a bunch of tards.  
So basically what I’m saying all the stocks on the popular thread have good sentiment behind them and your actions to hold will dictate of the stock rises, rockets or moons.   Or if it stays flat or keeps dipping.  
In the end all good stocks will rise over time. So if you bet money you actually need now over feelings you are a detriment to these rocket launches.  And if you bet money your not afraid to lose then sit back hold your bags and enjoy the show.  🚀🍀☘️🍀☘️❤️☘️🍀☘️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️☘️🍀🍀☘️🍀☘️☘️
This is WALL STREET BETS not Wall Street sound investing.  Foh with your paper hands!!!!!"

2021-06-14 11:06:34,wallstreetbets,100% of my portfolio is in CLOV
2021-06-14 11:50:47,wallstreetbets,"$CLOV is finally consolidating, amazing how the short ladder attacks only pushed us 4% down and with a lower volume this proves we are holding.

Since the institutions are owning 100%+ and are in the long haul they won’t sell for a small 2-3x profit like paper handers so this is a good retail to institutions # of shares owned.

2 million shares were available to short this morning and they took full advantage and returned 300k for today as they are getting nervous and yet the price barely dropped.

This is where it MOONS APES 🦍🚀"

Retail owns 98% of the float as of June 2nd: 501mil OS/491 mil shares owned = 98% shares held by retail

Friday 18th ITM call options are over 49 million when we close above 40$. And the number climbs the higher the price closes. ( do the math with my previous point now)

When you own the float, you set your own price. #AMC500K

2021-06-14 15:10:30,wallstreetbets,"From Yahoo Money News:

Why it matters: Though meme stocks are off their highs, they continue to trade at sky-high valuations disconnected from fundamentals. Many, like AMC, GameStop and newcomer Clover Health, booked another day of gains in Friday's session.

How it works: Call options give buyers the right to purchase a specific stock within a certain time period. A buyer of the call option makes money when the stock rises in price.

An increase in call options activity can force the sellers of the options to buy the stock, since they may have to deliver the shares. This pushes the stock price up.

The chain of events is known as a gamma squeeze.

State of play: Investors like hedge funds could be buying certain stocks to try to trigger a gamma squeeze, Helen Thomas, founder of U.K.-based financial research firm Blonde Money, told the WSJ."

2021-06-14 10:31:38,wallstreetbets,I find it so crazy that people are actively trading tickers like CLOV which clearly had its spike nearly a week ago. That's not to say it'll never come back. But it's clear that people are just bagholding and trying to pump because they got caught up in some crazy price targets and didn't take profits at the optimal time. Volume's been dropping and the price has been steadily going down since running up from $9 to $22 in 2 days but people will be on here blaming short ladder attacks or some shit because they bought at the top and didn't realise that every normal investor will be taking profits instead of delusionally thinking it's going to keep rising in the short-term.

2021-06-14 16:28:18,wallstreetbets,Guess we are just waiting for retards to make it a meme stock again.
2021-06-14 19:17:00,wallstreetbets,I don’t know. Hope this helps
2021-06-14 11:02:04,wallstreetbets,"If we can break that 14.80 strong, will feel a lot better"
2021-06-14 11:02:07,wallstreetbets,We're eating tonight
2021-06-14 13:04:53,wallstreetbets,"If we can get it up to $20 by end of week, the shorts will be fucked into next month."
2021-06-14 17:05:33,wallstreetbets,But we hold and buy still the same!
2021-06-14 13:02:25,wallstreetbets,"As a CLOV holder, I hope you guys moon."
2021-06-14 11:17:26,wallstreetbets,Clov is sneaky alright
2021-06-14 12:09:23,wallstreetbets,A lot of the money I lost in the market overall has been from panic selling my positions.
2021-06-14 16:21:52,wallstreetbets,"BB is not a fluke 
It has real value but ppl want money in a day"
2021-06-14 16:19:23,wallstreetbets,Haha fr that stupid hoe ‘ but at least it’s resisting at 14$😈

2021-06-14 17:58:10,wallstreetbets,"8% cost to borrow as of an hour ago......Short interest still at 36%

I hold 6/18 19c looking for the turnaround of which you speak!"
2021-06-14 08:53:27,wallstreetbets,Yeah looks like shares available at IBKR went from 1400000 to 500000 so someone shorted 900K shares between Friday close and now. Basically almost all the sell volume are these idiots tripling down and almost no real shareholders are selling.
2021-06-14 13:33:21,wallstreetbets,I’d say 100+ you’ve got 500k itm expiring Friday this week and next weeks call volume on 145k is bonkers.
2021-06-14 13:33:05,wallstreetbets,"Heavy resistance right now, break through 60 opens up to 63"
2021-06-14 13:36:17,wallstreetbets,"$200.

Then how did I end up - 10%?"
2021-06-14 17:03:08,wallstreetbets,"You missed it, that was for the past 3 years or so prior to January"
2021-06-14 11:03:26,wallstreetbets,Today is laying the foundation for a healthy week.
2021-06-14 11:22:17,wallstreetbets,Bet.

2021-06-14 15:56:19,wallstreetbets,Look at that wick and they still managed to drop it over a dollar in seconds with all that buying going on. Very natural price action super cool super legal.
2021-06-14 15:57:02,wallstreetbets,"It's not being suppressed, you schizos. It's not worth more than $15 a share. You idiots are about to have a very rude awakening this week."

2021-06-14 08:59:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah and shorts added 900K volume on ibkr alone between 5pm Friday and now.

Only sellers are shorts"
2021-06-14 11:52:12,wallstreetbets,Ape Strong! I was expecting a bigger dip myself. Glad we all held!!!
2021-06-14 19:13:30,wallstreetbets,Here here!  🙌🏼💎☘️🚀💯

2021-06-14 08:38:24,wallstreetbets,Until $50 AT LEAST
2021-06-14 11:23:11,wallstreetbets,Incoming 👽
2021-06-14 16:23:50,wallstreetbets,It will have a hard- open just like it had a hard- close I'm seeing 90 Yeezy
2021-06-14 08:15:30,wallstreetbets,You son of a bitch im in. More CLOV it is
2021-06-14 11:13:09,wallstreetbets,Same!
2021-06-14 11:19:45,wallstreetbets,He can't. No more shares left in the coffer until we vote whether to approve 25 million shares that CANNOT be used until 2022.
2021-06-14 11:20:38,wallstreetbets,It's always been a long play 👽
2021-06-14 13:02:01,wallstreetbets,I would say CLOV but I am bias
2021-06-14 13:38:34,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-14 10:33:56,wallstreetbets,🦍
2021-06-14 14:15:16,wallstreetbets,It’s always been the way 🚀🚀
2021-06-14 17:08:22,wallstreetbets,"We're still in a bull pennant pattern, with 13.70s being the low of the current bottom trendline. If the pattern holds true, we should be seeing a breakout of 14.80s tomorrow and breaking past 15... from there, we would need some volume to sustain the upward momentum. Generally, patterns are a self-fulfilling prophecy though, so if people are big on TA and see that, they could trade the breakout to the upside for a good momentum play. I would watch for that. Fundamentally, nothing has changed - no new news. Today's trading session makes it seem like BB is tracking GME more than AMC definitely, so maybe keep a watch for that as well? I did notice when AMC was pushing upwards momentum today, BB was as well to a much lesser extent...and when AMC lost momentum, BB did too. I dunno, but BB is still significantly undervalued compared to its peers and I really hope that $14 is the new floor."
2021-06-14 19:57:43,wallstreetbets,"Doubt it will get that high. The farthest I see it going is $200. Still, not too shabby."
2021-06-14 19:57:10,wallstreetbets,"More like when it hits 30, dump half, and free roll the long run"
2021-06-14 12:53:01,wallstreetbets,if it's too late why would I still be holding at $60
2021-06-14 13:07:36,wallstreetbets,Chill boss why you trippin
2021-06-14 13:10:29,wallstreetbets,"Shorts covering on low of the day. May be the first of several, buy and hold.  They are fucked"
2021-06-14 15:29:20,wallstreetbets,Hold$!!!!!
2021-06-14 09:43:55,wallstreetbets,No worries bud.  BB's day is inevitable
2021-06-14 10:08:12,wallstreetbets,Hold your CLOV!
2021-06-14 10:57:21,wallstreetbets,"It'll be just fine mate, facts are facts."
2021-06-14 11:51:15,wallstreetbets,I’m liking this!
2021-06-14 13:06:42,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it I'm in, not much only 10 shares."
2021-06-14 13:08:39,wallstreetbets,That would make my nipples hard
2021-06-14 15:07:55,wallstreetbets,Bleed the fuckers dry💁‍♂️

2021-06-14 15:49:18,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-14 16:08:01,wallstreetbets,I think AMC is going to make sharp moves in AH and/or PM. It's really going to be interesting to see how they open tomorrow.
2021-06-14 19:47:10,wallstreetbets,BB down 13 cents today. CLOV down .37. there was no tank. I own and believe in both stocks. CLOV and BB 🚀 don't u shit on a 🍀 bag holder again
2021-06-14 19:42:51,wallstreetbets,"You can even make a bit of coin daily buying/selling as BB consistently ends above daily low. Of course, you would need a really good fortune teller or crystal ball and go against the wsb ethos of diamond hands, but some people have the small, nibbly buy strategy anyway. Stay focused…I’m in on BB for big gains, not little gains."
2021-06-14 08:45:53,wallstreetbets,Sentiment today is bullish. Period 😛
2021-06-14 12:48:36,wallstreetbets,well I've got BB and I've felt like a bitch since I've had it
2021-06-14 15:50:12,wallstreetbets,I just bought more

2021-06-14 10:30:03,wallstreetbets,Feels good to get more shares and lower my average. CLOV is gonna 🚀.
2021-06-14 09:23:08,wallstreetbets,"CLOV, you should check out the r/CLOV subreddit, some good info there"
2021-06-14 09:22:43,wallstreetbets,CLOV no doubt
2021-06-14 09:27:06,wallstreetbets,I’m in on CLOV. I believe
2021-06-14 09:20:47,wallstreetbets,CLOV
2021-06-14 08:14:29,wallstreetbets,CLOV is the way 🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀
2021-06-14 17:54:42,wallstreetbets,Hmmmmm interesting point. I never look at daily candles
2021-06-14 08:42:52,wallstreetbets,"No doubt about! After BB moons, u can buy a house for you, and your wife’s boyfriend"

2021-06-14 13:12:01,wallstreetbets,I would bet on CLOV over CLNE
2021-06-14 13:09:34,wallstreetbets,CLOV all the way mate.

Glad to take more away from you tomorrow"
2021-06-14 17:37:35,wallstreetbets,Me likey. You couldnt have lost money today holding long calls on a red day. Sounds bullish AF if you ask me.
2021-06-14 14:41:13,wallstreetbets,You’d think with all the hype on Reddit it might get blown up in a meme like status but that’s the best part is it’s not a joke like these others
2021-06-14 18:31:09,wallstreetbets,Hopefully $50 now

2021-06-14 15:03:13,wallstreetbets,God i hate that commercial
2021-06-14 10:06:14,wallstreetbets,"Clov is third most shorted stock and has huge upside potential. Just inked contracts with medicare equipment providers which will be very lucrative. $80 is my target. 

I am not a financial advisor and not qualified to give financial advice."

2021-06-14 16:48:47,wallstreetbets,Consider this your dip.
2021-06-14 17:01:01,wallstreetbets,"That's because AMC has moved beyond Reddit into the wider Twitter, FB, etc. crowd.

IMO Reddit besides AMC and GME (tho to a lesser extent now) is mostly craptastic shilled P&D tickers.  You look at their subs and the quality of conversations (even if they have large volume of comments) and it's very low.  Doesn't feel organic at all."
2021-06-14 17:10:48,wallstreetbets,Because they hate how firmly we hold our AMC and want us to be like them paper hands to boost their ego 😂
2021-06-14 10:24:37,wallstreetbets,Always

2021-06-14 17:44:07,wallstreetbets,Fr 👑
2021-06-14 09:10:46,wallstreetbets,No more than the GME and AMC bags were before they mooned. CLOV will moon. If you aren’t in the fight you can’t profit. There are always naysayers. Looks like you are one. I will think of you when I’m reaping the CLOV rewards. It’s not if… It’s when!
2021-06-14 12:29:37,wallstreetbets,"Clov has high short interest, and a decent business. Amc could definitely keep running but it's not going to be an actual short squeeze now"
2021-06-14 12:26:02,wallstreetbets,"Amc up almost 50% last 2 days, can go another 50 this week"
2021-06-14 12:32:24,wallstreetbets,Not a trap
2021-06-14 12:32:30,wallstreetbets,"Nope… It’s poised to moon. HF will do all they can to stop it. All we have to do is buy, hold and be patient. It’s a battle but we will win!"
2021-06-14 15:15:14,wallstreetbets,GME and AMC were always the plan.
2021-06-14 10:26:21,wallstreetbets,So much true. Youtubers hyped amc in this weekend showing their analysys and predictions
2021-06-14 09:42:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah Bud!

2021-06-14 08:47:25,wallstreetbets,Amc to $145 by Friday
2021-06-14 09:52:44,wallstreetbets,They’re trying to shake people out
2021-06-14 11:44:29,wallstreetbets,"""Well, of course I know him. He's me"" - Obi Wan"
2021-06-14 10:59:01,wallstreetbets,That isn't what this is lol
2021-06-14 14:35:07,wallstreetbets,Cause they’re not the same stock
2021-06-14 14:41:16,wallstreetbets,"It should be because AMC options expired last week with about 150,000 coming due. If it broke $50 there were about 50k more. Sucks us 🦍 got distracted or today would be better. CLOV only has monthly contracts coming June 18. Shorts have to buy and cover by tomorrow on AMC so there is extra buy volume.  Now this run up on AMC will make more need to cover for this Friday. CLOV has them this Friday too but the shorts are growing on AMC not CLOV. AmC has legit squeeze potential the next few weeks. CLOV has mostly just us after this week. Possible squeeze this week."
2021-06-14 18:43:50,wallstreetbets,If GME can hit $347 then the sky is the limit.
2021-06-14 18:58:54,wallstreetbets,"200 within 2 weeks, 500+ afterwards"
2021-06-14 09:45:36,wallstreetbets,lol it went down by 39 cents
2021-06-14 09:46:07,wallstreetbets,It's called the morning dip and it happens every day.
2021-06-14 09:49:09,wallstreetbets,no worries bud we ape strong
2021-06-14 10:27:09,wallstreetbets,Nio is a great buy
2021-06-14 11:00:52,wallstreetbets,Low volume is great news. Means shorts will have trouble covering
2021-06-14 11:00:17,wallstreetbets,Short interest is still high though. This will push days to cover.
2021-06-14 11:00:53,wallstreetbets,Better than dropping off with high volume
2021-06-14 08:01:43,wallstreetbets,I confess I'm going to buy more 🍇🍇 today
2021-06-14 10:19:40,wallstreetbets,16%
2021-06-14 13:26:32,wallstreetbets,Well we expect and adjustment to a value more suited for what they do. Might not be as crazy as other stocks but a 5 dollar move to 20 is possible
2021-06-14 13:46:55,wallstreetbets,Sounds like bullshit
2021-06-14 06:22:47,wallstreetbets,CLOV is on Trading 212 which people in Germany can use as a broker. is it not on there in DE? Or is it some specific country restriction?
2021-06-14 06:29:31,wallstreetbets,I am also from Germany and got into the ones I can get BB & GME
2021-06-14 08:34:41,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀
2021-06-14 14:39:31,wallstreetbets,That’s what I’m saying. Seems like the collective investors of BB know it’s not supposed to be a meme. We don’t want pump n dump gains to capitulate overnight. This ships going to the moon whether anyone likes it or not just won’t be a five minute ride like these others jokes of a stock lol
2021-06-14 15:29:47,wallstreetbets,Literally clov holders barely talk shit. It’s always amc instigating lol
2021-06-14 15:39:35,wallstreetbets,"What sub are you watching? I don't see much of that here at all. At Clover, we want everyone to do well, we just happen to think you can do well with CLVR  too."
2021-06-14 15:29:48,wallstreetbets,Idk why we don’t just hold them all? There’s like 5
2021-06-14 17:49:13,wallstreetbets,Both
2021-06-14 17:45:19,wallstreetbets,AMC
2021-06-14 19:43:55,wallstreetbets,Post porn loss
2021-06-14 19:32:06,wallstreetbets,RIP buddy
2021-06-14 19:42:30,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I think shorting a meme stock is a bad move to begin with lol, but I don't think puts is the best option if you're gonna short, you'd probably get crushed by IV if volume starts dropping"
2021-06-14 10:16:11,wallstreetbets,"22 shares of $AMC
167 shares of $BB 
Let’s go apes 🦍!!!
Got my SpaceX 🚀loaded with bananas!!! I’m skipping the moon and going straight to Mars!!!!!"
2021-06-14 10:44:48,wallstreetbets,"One of your threads top posts is to go and spam CLOV on WSB, straight fucking cringe"

Thank me later 😂"
2021-06-14 18:32:32,wallstreetbets,And citadel is going bankrupt

2021-06-14 08:58:23,wallstreetbets,Dumbass go look at shares availability on fintel and iborrowdesk. The only idiots selling are shorts
2021-06-14 08:58:32,wallstreetbets,Watching AMC go to $3 is a nightmare for 🦍🦍🦍 NOT a dream
2021-06-14 11:21:14,wallstreetbets,"Come on GME apes, let’s make some money"
2021-06-14 15:05:40,wallstreetbets,I’m not a bot I’m just depressed
2021-06-14 15:07:00,wallstreetbets,I'm good. Just wish there were more fireworks
2021-06-14 15:11:55,wallstreetbets,Beep boop CLOV moon 🍀🚀
2021-06-14 13:08:04,wallstreetbets,Hahahahah
2021-06-14 13:12:47,wallstreetbets,You made the right decision bud. 💎
2021-06-14 18:14:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm becoming impatient with BB - I don't think it's going to be moving much anytime soon and that money is better off in AMC. In the past 2 weeks, it's barely even moved out of the $14 zone."
2021-06-14 18:15:50,wallstreetbets,Buying in late does not make me feel good.
2021-06-14 18:07:31,wallstreetbets,Honestly that's a bad idea. Simply because BB and Clov have a shit load of potential to also climb high. What ppl should be doing instead is buy when possible even if it's just 1 share of each. As long as we don't give ground. APES should and will win.
2021-06-14 18:56:16,wallstreetbets,Sold my BB for a small profit put that into AMC. Got into clov cheap only xx shares I'll roll the dice on that one. AMC tho that one's special.
2021-06-14 18:07:05,wallstreetbets,"I got downvoted into oblivion for pointing this out a few days ago, I completely agree, AMC all the way, Im already holding BB for a while too but Im focusing on AMC personally

Not financial advice btw"
2021-06-14 17:58:28,wallstreetbets,This is what I did.
2021-06-14 09:54:49,wallstreetbets,"All the market is rigged, sir"
2021-06-14 09:57:08,wallstreetbets,It’s alright.
2021-06-14 14:18:49,wallstreetbets,"I just think it's neat.

Also they are working with Amazon to create an app for their vehicles. They're not a phone company anymore, they're a software company that also specializes in cyber security. I feel like they are going places. I think the stock is undervalued and has good fundamentals."
2021-06-14 14:15:17,wallstreetbets,Amc already blew
2021-06-14 11:19:28,wallstreetbets,Hahaha I’m in the middle of reading that book rn actually 😂
2021-06-14 15:20:30,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it I'm holding this BS market out. BB will rise from the ashes into an industry monster they just need time for EV sector to grow organically.

Edit: not holding bags I got in at like 13 but I am prepared to bag hold"
2021-06-14 12:43:10,wallstreetbets,He should have stuck with CLOV or at least sold the tip to rebuy the dip.
2021-06-14 13:10:24,wallstreetbets,80’s
2021-06-14 13:11:14,wallstreetbets,$65-$69
2021-06-14 13:14:54,wallstreetbets,I think if APEs can manage to stay unified and continue to control 80+ percent of the float then when this $#!+ Squeezes it will shoot up to astronomical prices.  But there is no telling when that will happen and there is a lot of social engineering working on our FUD.
2021-06-14 13:14:30,wallstreetbets,"They will try their hardest to not have it go to $70 by EOW. If that happens, its a definite gamma squeeze with so many options in the money."
2021-06-14 11:30:30,wallstreetbets,I’m doing CLOV instead
2021-06-14 06:57:19,wallstreetbets,"It is, I feel like we don’t even have to talk about it anymore here tho, it’s the king of meme stocks and isn’t going anywhere"
2021-06-14 07:08:02,wallstreetbets,"GME is the 'safe' meme stock. It still has rocket potential and people will add it to their portfolios 'just in case'. Went from 8>400>40, price floor of 40 set, 40>360>180, price floor of 180 set.

There will be another pump eventually but of all the memes its one with decent risk/reward, its proven itself that apes arent going to sell. Some of the new meme stocks don't have that prooven track record yet"
2021-06-14 13:39:51,wallstreetbets,Well thats your first mistake.. Reading DD at all
2021-06-14 13:39:19,wallstreetbets,The time will come
2021-06-14 13:41:50,wallstreetbets,She stoned.
2021-06-14 13:40:39,wallstreetbets,This is not a thread for Tilray.
2021-06-14 10:30:30,wallstreetbets,cap
2021-06-14 10:33:27,wallstreetbets,Good luck doing that to AMC
2021-06-14 07:46:43,wallstreetbets,"Soon.
High."
2021-06-14 10:50:25,wallstreetbets,Is this that T. Boone Pickens company? Do you remember his commercials from a decade ago? Is that dude even still alive? If so I'll put him on my death pool going forward.
2021-06-14 10:49:56,wallstreetbets,I eat my own cum for breakfast
2021-06-14 15:38:46,wallstreetbets,Can't hold the bag with puts that will expire worthless
2021-06-14 15:50:33,wallstreetbets,I’m sorry for you in advance
2021-06-14 15:36:37,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-14 06:17:03,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, what are they even thinking. One share will cost at least $10 000."
2021-06-14 07:45:07,wallstreetbets,That’s not how any of the squeezes have worked - lots of fluctuations leading to a major event. Stonks don’t ONLY go up like everyone on this sub thinks they do.
2021-06-14 07:49:42,wallstreetbets,"Check old AMC/GME squeeze charts.  Answer to your question is there, simply:  No.  It can go down, up, or sideways before lift off.  Assuming it ever happens...  That's why it's a gamble.

Also, pm on a single Monday morning is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things lol."
2021-06-14 08:10:24,wallstreetbets,More BB you retard ❤️
2021-06-14 08:32:10,wallstreetbets,CLOV
2021-06-14 08:14:17,wallstreetbets,I’d watch that show. MTV true life: I’m a bag holder. Opening scene pans to me giving blowies behind a Wendy’s….
2021-06-14 10:15:26,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-06-14 12:11:45,wallstreetbets,Time to buy some CLOV brother.
2021-06-14 12:11:10,wallstreetbets,Fuck you traitor.
2021-06-14 10:34:11,wallstreetbets,What do you know?  Do your DD and come back again. Clov🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-14 10:33:47,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. Go look at the DD on Clov and it's SI. It's not you losing money, so why do you care to come on here and spread misinformation? People are trying to pump to make shorts cover, fool."
2021-06-14 10:33:57,wallstreetbets,U get downvoted for telling the truth here. Becareful
2021-06-14 10:32:51,wallstreetbets,This is like 90% of tickers on this sub.
2021-06-14 07:56:12,wallstreetbets,Isn't a post like this suppose to come with nudes?

2021-06-14 09:25:15,wallstreetbets,"some are just straight banned by mentioning clov, so something is going on"
2021-06-14 09:30:01,wallstreetbets,history has shown me that typically the less people talking about it premarket. the more people doing
2021-06-14 09:25:33,wallstreetbets,literally every second shitpost here is about CLOV
2021-06-14 14:04:40,wallstreetbets,"Actually it dipped to 40s and the beast that it is, came roaring back to 60 - I think next is 80?"
2021-06-14 14:12:11,wallstreetbets,"It went below $40 and bounced back multiple times with consistent upward movement than sudden up 

I find it healthy this way , prefer
This over a sudden 2 hours run and die later"
2021-06-14 14:08:22,wallstreetbets,"You must have picked it up today or last Friday.  This is the first pull back since it's run up.  Nothing to be afraid of.  CLF isn't one to check every 5 minutes.  If you have clf weeklies expiring Friday you're doing it wrong.
Edit: Its not too late to buy shares or leaps.  Personally, that is what I have done."
2021-06-14 11:29:24,wallstreetbets,I’m in both BB is a long hold for me
2021-06-14 11:31:15,wallstreetbets,Wrong
2021-06-14 11:31:48,wallstreetbets,Shut up ass clown. Invest the 100 you have in your account into amc and then you can buy your peasant shares of bb later.
2021-06-14 16:22:20,wallstreetbets,LEAPS
2021-06-14 09:25:24,wallstreetbets,Nothing
2021-06-14 09:25:30,wallstreetbets,No
2021-06-14 09:28:52,wallstreetbets,Same reason GME is almost double the price of apple...
2021-06-14 09:30:03,wallstreetbets,Share price doesn’t matter.  It’s the market cap that matters. You should probably spend some time on investopedia before asking more questions.
2021-06-14 14:35:07,wallstreetbets,!remind me in 4 days
2021-06-14 16:16:42,wallstreetbets,I don’t think so

2021-06-14 11:33:56,wallstreetbets,"You’re half right. Raising rates would crash the market, but it would send meme stocks into another galaxy. Do some DD on the reverse repo market."
2021-06-14 14:02:55,wallstreetbets,Whats the difference
2021-06-14 08:51:53,wallstreetbets,"We get it, you hold amc"
2021-06-14 08:48:47,wallstreetbets,"BB needs to catch up, AMC will hold"
2021-06-14 08:49:05,wallstreetbets,This is most definitely not the way.
2021-06-14 13:26:06,wallstreetbets,Thank you
2021-06-14 15:26:44,wallstreetbets,Soon they’ll see tendies. 🚀
2021-06-14 16:28:57,wallstreetbets,"lol they are both up 97% and 40% respectively in the last month, and CLOV is only down 13% in the last week, while CLNE is still up 7% in the week. How could you possibly be holding bags? If you bought at the peak, AVERAGE DOWN for fucks sake, you literally only lose money when you sell. Imagine if all the panic sellers in GME and other stocks in January just AVERAGED DOWN instead of taking massive losses, and helping the institutions drive the prices down? Instead of selling a $480/share bag, they could have easily averaged down to $60-$80 with the $40 dip in February. Please, learn from the mistakes of memes past. For all of our sakes. 🙏🏻💎🙌🏻"
2021-06-14 11:49:53,wallstreetbets,69
2021-06-14 15:39:35,wallstreetbets,"All good news from a technical standpoint, SI continuing to rise so this is just more rocket fuel. It’s nearly impossible to predict the exact timeline for when it’ll rise rapidly but it will at some point. Go look at how volatile GME was for weeks and weeks before the real squeeze.

If a 3% drop makes you go running for the hills you really don’t get it."
2021-06-14 15:57:21,wallstreetbets,🍀life
2021-06-14 15:55:44,wallstreetbets,No it doesn’t lmfao
2021-06-14 16:35:59,wallstreetbets,Good buy.  Hold that in your back pocket.   It’s time is coming.
2021-06-14 11:06:41,wallstreetbets,"I feel bad you’re getting downvoted, it’s the last hour the market is open"
2021-06-14 11:59:56,wallstreetbets,"Wrong daily, nephew."
2021-06-14 11:28:24,wallstreetbets,You do realize that a lot of volume is just algorithmic trading for any given stock right? If you really think retail just dumped 22M shares you're out of your mind.
2021-06-14 11:23:47,wallstreetbets,"BB to the moon, why not invest more into BB, but hold the CLOV investment"
2021-06-14 11:22:16,wallstreetbets,Perfect; now CLOV will go up.
2021-06-14 15:51:40,wallstreetbets,Found another bot
2021-06-14 13:32:08,wallstreetbets,Wrong place amigo.
2021-06-14 11:02:42,wallstreetbets,"Something doesn't have to be a distraction. And for amc, short interest is 12%, and it's massively overvalued so people continuing to pile into it for no reason at all can get burned eventually"

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/BB"
2021-06-14 12:27:17,wallstreetbets,so what the company is trying to make money and strengthen themselves in the longrun for me that is bullish even that they are selling it to hedge. hedge sells it back but we keep buying and fuckin with their short positions
2021-06-14 09:29:07,wallstreetbets,foreshadowing?
2021-06-14 10:18:22,wallstreetbets,"NIO is very long term, not what we do here in WSB"

That’s the whole thing about AMC 
We will continue to see the fight 🦍🦍"
2021-06-14 16:01:51,wallstreetbets,Tf you talm bout. Not all these stocks do 100% in a day. It’s a buildup. That’s how you get in the earliest

2021-06-14 10:18:40,wallstreetbets,"Ill take bets on that action.

What odds you giving me?"
2021-06-14 11:36:22,wallstreetbets,CLOV is about to pop what are you talking about

2021-06-14 11:42:40,wallstreetbets,"Do it, CLOV is a red herring and all those invested are going to lose it all. The pump and dump came and went."
2021-06-14 13:36:07,wallstreetbets,Agreed I know some ppl don’t want to hear it I sold mine for a loss clov has burned me to many times this past 7 months
2021-06-14 09:45:00,wallstreetbets,BB is a long hold. Set it and forget about it for a year.
2021-06-14 06:41:59,wallstreetbets,And heavily shorted.  So lets hammer it.

2021-06-14 12:01:33,wallstreetbets,Is this the new “you could have made more on gme but you waste it on BB and AMC”?
2021-06-14 11:58:45,wallstreetbets,Stop fucking dividing apes bruh. AMC people keep dividing us. I’m mostly in CLOV but you don’t see me spreading FUD about AMC. This shit is corny af.

I am in this for the long haul, I was up 2310% on my options and didn’t sell.

2021-06-14 18:20:36,wallstreetbets,Sold most of my BB last week and went AMC.  Will get back into BB later because I believe it’s a company that will rise out of the ashes.  BB is 100% long game.

2021-06-14 18:23:07,wallstreetbets,"For now, AMC is going to be my play, if BB moons then I'll jump back in, but for now, I don't see it doing anything special."
2021-06-14 15:33:46,wallstreetbets,"Holding my bags at 15.74, this APE aint scurred"

2021-06-14 07:15:50,wallstreetbets,"GME hit 320 last week, people stop buying cause the price becomes to high. It is king of all stock memes, but part of the past."
2021-06-14 10:25:53,wallstreetbets,"A new guitar is a good goal, my acoustic is a little beat up. I’m saving my money for some night vision goggles and infrared capabilities on my AR🙏🏼"
2021-06-14 19:42:53,wallstreetbets,Retard detected
2021-06-14 19:20:19,wallstreetbets,That’s the most retarded statement ever

2021-06-14 14:52:18,wallstreetbets,POWER HOUR CLNE
2021-06-14 14:53:41,wallstreetbets,"$clne, CLNE-ing up the dip!. Back to over 12 AH"
2021-06-14 14:56:27,wallstreetbets,"CLNE will be 5% minimum daily gains this week, that's conservative,  this little pull back on the day is meaningless"
2021-06-14 14:59:25,wallstreetbets,"Here is the handbook for making money as an institutional investor:

  
1. Come in here and comment with a bunch of rockets attached to specific tickers that people are familiar with on a ""household name"" type understanding or if the ticker is a word itself. If you are too busy get a programmer to build a bot. It is best if you do so a couple of days in a row and even more profitable if you can do a DD/Technical Analysis on said ticker. It doesn't even matter if what you write has any credibility. Make it bright and shiny with lofty expectations. You just need to plant the seed.  


2. When you are ready and the hype/hope is spreading, drive the price up to a double digit percentage gain upon opening. Dangle it for a day or two and really get the hype going. At this point interest will be at an all-time high and the echo chamber will be deafening.  
Now here is the important part. Let it tank down to where it was and even a little lower than when you started as this gets people interested even more bc they think they are getting a deal on something they cannot value. This is where you will also get the most profits due to people exploring the options market and gambling with real money. Speaking on valuation of the company, it doesn't matter. Fundamentals do not matter.  


3. Now its on to after hours. This will really pique interest and be beneficial to you as little volume is needed to raise it 3-5%. When the market closes at 4pm, sky rocket that shit and let it mellow, wait an hour and do the same thing. Now dopamine is ripping and they are all aboard the hype train in the AM.  


4. Next step involves playing off the after hours from the previous night. When pre market opens raise it even higher. It could be 2-4 percent or 1%, it doesn't matter. When the market opens, you tank that fucking stock and scalp your profits.  


5. Rinse and Repeat.

&#x200B;

Tread carefully out there folks."

That way operators can hype up their companies, and investors can trick retail into picking up their bags. Even their hosts are scummy. Suze Orman is basically promoting a Ponzi scheme right now. I'd say a few of them (e.g., Becky Quick, Andrew Ross Sorkin) have integrity, but a lot of the content there is gross."

Comparing just p/s ratios to Logitech and you can value CRSR at $8B mc (260% potential upside, price target of $84). Not to mention it has 20%+ short interest. Get on before it runs, already up 8% in the premarket. Next catalyst: another stellar earnings after consolidating for 10 months now. Don’t trust me though, I’m retarded  

Obligatory bear case: sales/growth declines once everything opens up post-pandemic."

2021-06-14 12:49:42,wallstreetbets," A few more deets about the Amazon fuel agreement:  
Amazon receives warrants for 53.14 million shares of CLNE common stock at an exercise price of $13.49/share. Those warrants become available to Amazon at set intervals as Amazon moves towards its commitment in the agreement to purchase $500M in fuel from CLNE.  
13.28 million of the warrant shares are immediately available to Amazon.  Amazon will have incentive to exercise these warrants the higher the share price rises over $13.49.  
These warrants will essentially act as a dilution when exercised by Amazon.  However, CLNE stands to gain the $500M in revenue plus $716.86M from the warrant shares over the life of this agreement.  Amazon has until 04/16/31 to exercise the warrants.  Once/if fully executed, Amazon would own 19.99% of CLNE common shares."

2021-06-14 10:02:49,wallstreetbets,Don't think these $CLNE dips are people selling off or taking profits. They're holding to at least 16 but aiming for 25-30. Just short sellers trying to save their portfolio

2021-06-14 14:46:23,wallstreetbets,"Not to accuse anyone of something but it's kinda weird how you literally see money getting out of the classic meme stocks into random shit that just pops up. Like why would you take your money out off companies that have been 173727 dicussed on here just to chase a bag you heard of two seconds ago? (WOOF)

I mean you see in the charts when money leaves and goes somewhere else.

I know I'm CLNE biased but hell stay in GME AMC or BB or whatever instead of doing that. You have more luck with these ones guranteed."

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WKHS why you shouldn't be short (no financial advice) Common sense tells me beeing short on **Workhorse (WKHS)** is bad.

Allow me to summarize:

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks.
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles. The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and force this to happen.
3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These companies are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse has a proprietary system to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps increase revenue.
5. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), has purchased a few million shares for her fund
6. In April, Workhorse **more than doubled its production** of trucks in comparison to the **combined previous three quarters**. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's **6230!!! That's an enormous amount of trucks.** They couldn't produce this because of global limitations. There is a bottleneck within the global supply chain in part due to offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has affected the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only **TEMPORARY** and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to sell and make money.
7. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase. This number will be nothing compared to the 325 million dollars they will receive from pride group once they produce enough trucks to fill the order. That is just one customer, and remember that once world conditions are back to normal they will be producing trucks at a way faster speed.
8. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
9. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies.
10. 350,00 delivery trucks are sold per year according to the New York Times. This number will most likely increase.
11. Calls with a strike price of $15 for Jun 18, 2021 had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options. This may mean investors may be expecting a big move.
12. You're helping the environment by investing in this company.
13. This stock has already a 51% short of its float. Beeing short on this stock is very risky right now. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float and look what it did. WKHS has a float that is a 4th of AMC’s float and it has double the short interest of the float. This means the chance way less buyers to buy up the float compared to other stocks.
14. Ortex has issued 2 signals for WKHS in just the last week. Remember this is the same website that issued the same signal for AMC at 12 dollars a share. -> Another reason to stay away from shorts.

TLDR

Workhorse (WKHS) is a highly-shorted (51% short interest of float) stock with lucrative future. It is still priced pretty low(also because of the hight SI). There is tremendous potential for gains here.

Please note, I am not a financial analyst, only a retard that makes retarded bets 😉🚀

Thanks for Attention!"

2021-06-14 13:11:37,wallstreetbets,All in
2021-06-14 07:29:26,wallstreetbets,"Some modifications...

Point 3 - It is hard to assume that legacy companies can or cannot catch up, when WKHS has yet to produce much or demonstrate an ability to achieve profitable mass production.

Point 5 - Cathie Woods sold all her WKHS shares.

Point 6 - WKHS said it produced 38 C-Series vehicles this year (through March), which is more than double the combined prior three quarters. So they are at roughly 13 trucks per month. At that rate it will take them 50 years to fulfill the Pride Group order. The issue is can WKHS get to profitable mass production of these. That is a massive challenge. Losing money every quarter on low volume production, is not a viable business plan.

Point 8 - For Q1, they had expenses of about 17M versus 500K in revenue. 6M of those expenses where Cost of Goods. It would seem reasonable that as they increase production their costs will rise significantly. Perhaps revenues are rising at a faster rate, but as that loss from operations continues to increase in the coming quarters you will find the cash burn rate increasing. Basically unless they can keep costs flat between now and high volume production (not going to happen) they will be desperate for additional funds soon. Seriously, look at Revenues and operating costs and pray come up with a model that shows how they get from here to operating profit (or positive cash-flow) without needing additional funds. It is a near-impossibility I think.

2021-06-14 10:16:06,wallstreetbets,"Not saying WKHS will or will not fly in the short-term, but people need to be careful about electric vehicle companies. They are literally the dotcom hype.

There is a ton of hype around these companies but it is important people realize electrical vehicles will remain a complete niche market that is hardcapped by physics (electricity production, transport, rare earth materials for batteries and storage) that are not looking to be solved in the near future at all.

Within 5 to 10 years most major oil producing companies will have switched over to the production of emission free synthetic and bio fuels. All facilities and logistics that are currently involved in the production and distribution of fossil fuels can with relatively minor costs be refitted for the production and distribution of synthetic and bio fuels. The same goes for most modern combustion engines which can quite easily be refitted for the use of synthetic and bio fuels, or are already capable of doing so.

Make all the money you want in the shortterm on EV's but please be aware once the first big announcement on synthetic fuels comes in the electric vehicle industry will plummet and never recover."

2021-06-14 15:06:53,wallstreetbets,Can vouch. I drove a workhorse truck when I was a seasonal driver last year for UPS. That's what first made me think about buying stock in WKHS. Wish I bought at 7$
2021-06-14 10:57:02,wallstreetbets,"true, but at least WKHS is actually producing vehicles, albeit at a snail's pace rn"
2021-06-14 05:01:05,wallstreetbets,I can't confirm anything being this is just talk I've heard around the office. But I'm sure it's true because we're always running out of trucks due to growth/new routes popping up/old trucks being retired etc. What I CAN confirm is that Workhorse trucks have never broken down on me ever and they build a stout vehicle so I'm looking forward to some new ones.
2021-06-14 05:39:39,wallstreetbets,"I think anyone with a business plan that is EV centered is going to have work so long as they can meet production demands and actually produce a decent vehicle.

This sounds bad until you look at other examples of that did the same thing. Go look up wellcare group and what their company did in growth after the same issues clov was recently facing. WCG was close to 20 a share when they faced similar allegations. Their share prices dropped for a few months like we saw with clove then started a gradual climb from 20ish per share to 350 per share today. This happened over years but my point is CLOV is more than a meme stock, there is significant long term potential here."

Let’s say a meme stock is rapidly rising and then someone opens a short position at 100,000 shares at the peak and closes it after the stock drops back down a little, there are still 100,000 shares available to short but that volume still contributes to that short interest number you’re referencing.

2021-06-14 04:36:26,wallstreetbets,Did that last week. Can't imagine both go sideways this week.
2021-06-14 06:14:40,wallstreetbets,this is my strategy I implemented last week lol these are both such high potential plays don't wanna miss out on either one.
2021-06-14 07:00:50,wallstreetbets,How convenient to just say it's a lie that all of wall street is in on so you can keep peddling your crappy stocks
2021-06-14 09:29:39,wallstreetbets,"Ok but Fintel is the independent source and it roughly lines up. You have nothing else.  

If you don't want to believe the self reported #, FINE, but Fintel STILL produces the same results if you're targeting shorted stocks. 

What other data do you have lol?"
2021-06-14 04:38:49,wallstreetbets,"This is the thing. Either you trust the figures reported and we are at 20% or so. Or you don't, embrace the potential conspiracy theory and believe most of those who are in deep shit with hundred /Dozens of billions at stake would rather lie and pay a fine of a few hundred thousands to hide their crimes."
2021-06-14 04:26:19,wallstreetbets,Sure

2021-06-14 04:46:08,wallstreetbets,I can see it... Truck buyers look for horsepower over efficiency. For work it's necessary. For personal use it's the #1 showoff aspect.
2021-06-14 09:00:26,wallstreetbets,"Whenever companies are heavily shorted, it’s usually because the company is overvalued and due for a drop unless someone artificially pumps it. Which is what all these bots are trying to do."
2021-06-14 08:31:23,wallstreetbets,Uh barely over a million in revenue and like 13 million in costs.  Then they lost their only chance at a real contract not one of these bullshit someone put 50 bucks down preorders.
2021-06-14 04:24:17,wallstreetbets,I checked it. Inconsistent data.

Nothing wrong with a lot more transparency in that area."
2021-06-14 08:23:56,wallstreetbets,No.
2021-06-14 12:22:59,wallstreetbets,Do you know why the stock is so heavily shorted? Is it just an accounting artifact? The company has 0 debts and like 1.5bn in cash
2021-06-14 04:37:20,wallstreetbets,"Fintel but it might be incomplete info. ""Was"" = a month ago"
2021-06-14 07:27:25,wallstreetbets,I liked it but i played on high end gaming pc. Witcher 1 was a lot worse relative to its era. Id put cyberpunk around witcher 2 in terms of quality
2021-06-14 12:53:09,wallstreetbets,"After more research i dont think it'll squeeze but it's a pretty good long term bet imo. Company has 0 debt and tons of cash so that checks the boomer warren buffet boxes. You're not losing that much if company goes bankrupt tomorrow and it liquidates. 

The no squeeze is because short % is unclear with the split market. I only have vague news reports from europe about how heavily it's shorted there. Retail doesn't have easy access from us/canada where the disposable cash is. Even if people are interested you can't do those juicy options. 

As you can see from this thread people are still angry with the company right now which is ironic since people pilled in on GME and GME's entire business model was scam gamers. This is literally the exact opposite scenario where a long trusted company made bad marketing moves. They literally gave refunds to players who had disappointing experiences which is why the stock is plummeting further. They had a god awful shareholders meeting where the ceos tried to sell investors on giving refunds and continuing development for free updates and refused to disclose the q1 cyberpunk sales which were prolly awful since they're going to gamers and admitting they screwed up instead of lying their ass off."

2021-06-14 09:35:47,wallstreetbets,Where does Fintel get their data from?
2021-06-14 14:24:26,wallstreetbets,Does Fintel actually have a list of the most shorted or is it a hunt and find by ticker on their website?

2021-06-14 09:48:10,wallstreetbets,Honestly potential contracts from USPS and any news from them should be held in suspicion. They are “the most trusted government agency” and they use that to their advantage. I worked for USPS as a program manager for 10 years. Politicians use and abuse USPS to push personal agendas all the time.
2021-06-14 08:32:30,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't following them, thanks"
2021-06-14 04:33:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah seems there’s different numbers a lot but even at that it could have potential🚀🚀
2021-06-14 06:06:36,wallstreetbets,This is the official outdated number (updated only twice a month).
2021-06-14 09:13:52,wallstreetbets,What is it? You can PM me if needed.
2021-06-14 08:32:32,wallstreetbets,"Witcher 1 was absolutely not worse relative to its Era nice try.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PAA: Boring DD on boring company Plains All American Pipeline is NOT new high tech company with super growth potential. It is a fucking pipeline. It is a dinosaur that will go extinct in next 20 years. But it is a very good stock at least for the next 2 years:
1) Now trading at 12, and slowly recovering to pre-covid 16-18. 1.5x growth potential EOY.
2) Paying dividends.
3) 8.73 bln. market cap and 10.84 bln. net assets give PB ratio >1.  Net assets include impairment loss of goodwill and investment in other entities.
4) Balance sheet is built purely in physical assets and simple financial assets. Goodwill in 2020 was written-off to 0. No doubtful intangible assets and financial instruments that can go to 0 one day.
5) Positive operating cash flows despite loss in 2020. Again, because without impairment there would be no loss.
6) EPS is 0.36 for 1Q 2021. If profit remains steady PE at the EOY will be less than 9. That is very low at the current market.
7) CEO is Asian - Willie C. W. Chiang.

Cons:

1) Constant current ratio < 1 imposes a bit of liquidity risk.

My positions: 20 of Jan22 10C, 40 of Jan22 13C.

 “IS PLAINS ALL AMERICAN PIPELINE THE NEXT GME???”

“Why is PAA moving today?”"

With a dividend of 5.64% it is adequate for my needs."
2021-06-14 05:29:27,wallstreetbets,"20C will not print. It is solid no brainer stock with little but reliable return. It belongs to r/investing not WSB, but I am permanently banned there."
2021-06-14 05:12:18,wallstreetbets,"I am not saying it will print.

But the dividend is really high. Like 18 cents per share on a $12 stock. Thats enough to get dividend scalpers to run it up a few days prior to ex-dividend date. *(like approx 26 to 28 july although not officially announced thats an estimate)

But the run up is likely more to $14.30 or $14.80. I cannot see why it would run to $20 before next summer 

(Keep in mind the run up prior to ex dividend date will be followed by a drop of at least 18 cents or more the day the dividend cashes.) If you had $14 calls the day before ex-dividend date.....they probably pay. But the day after dividend pays.....they might be worthless.

Not financial advice. Just an opinion from someone who studies dividend related price action."
2021-06-14 10:41:05,wallstreetbets,"PAA is not WSB stock, it is just a good stock, it can't make 10000% return on options. PAA is balancing my loss on 150 SHOP Puts. The only way it can skyrocket if WSB all of a sudden will want to own a pipeline and play with a valve. Maybe to leave a couple of factories without gas just for fun."

We all know that Blackberry and Facebook was in a lawsuit over patents… Facebook settled with Blackberry and as part of that settlement, Blackberry could not disclose the settlement. John Chen (CEO of Blackberry) announced he is in a huge negotiations deal with a North American Company for a large amount of BlackBerry’s patents… The company willing to spend billion(s) on buying patents, would have a large sum of cash floating around. To me this would only make sense for Facebook to want to buy those patents (they lost the lawsuit, might as well own it legally now), and for Facebook to sweeten the deal, to go into business with Blackberry. It would be a win/win for both companies… let me know what you guys think?"

But I need more - the advent of these technologies becoming part of our day to day lives and not just for specialist medical needs is just around the corner. We need to get ahead of the game right now, we're talking about a decade of exponential growth for companies that can progress these technologies into the public consciousness.

There's competition and this market will evolve rapidly so we need to get the names we've got together so we can start making the real yolo plays. Everyone is familiar with SENS less so with IRTC but who are the other players? Can we make a list here and we'll get some DDs rolling off the back of it.

Digital diagnosis tools, remote health monitoring, anything like that - what do you know? And what companies are you looking at?"

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Woof WOOF

Petco Health and Wellness Co. ($WOOF) $22.16 - DD
Petco ($WOOF) is a brick and mortar store in the United States and Mexico, which provides pet food and pet related products, as well as serving as a veterinarian hospital and pet adoption centre in many locations. It also partners with companies like Canadian Tire to market its products in Canada. Kind of like Gamestop, this is an old-school brand in the suburbs, servicing a niche need - pets instead of video games. 

Petco was started in 1965, has nearly 1,500 locations and over 25,000 employees ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petco ). It began trading on the Nasdaq in January 2021, and had an opening price of ~$27. The current CEO, Ron Coughlin (formerly at HP and Pepsi), took over in 2018 and their performance has increased steadily since. 

On 19th May 2021, both Bank of America and Credit Suisse both set a price target of $28. On 2nd June 2021, Citigroup set a price target of $31. 

Petco is currently trading around $22, so it potentially has around 27% - 41.5% of upside before reaching fair value.  
Historically, $19 has been a support level for this stock. RSI(14) is currently at 39.27, so it's approaching oversold levels. 

However, as explained below, this stock may see a short squeeze before the end of June, so the short term upside could be much higher.

Fiscal Q1 2021 Highlights:
Comparisons are first quarter of 2021 ended May 1, 2021 versus first quarter of 2020 ended May 2, 2020 unless otherwise noted
	• Net revenue increased 27 percent to $1.4 billion driven by comp sales growth of 28 percent
	• Net income increased $38.7 million to $7.6 million or $0.03 per share, inclusive of $20.8 million of non-cash charges related to the refinancing of the company's term loan and revolving credit facility
	• Trailing twelve month net income of $12.2 million increased $101.8 million
	• Adjusted Net Income1 increased $60.0 million to $44.4 million or $0.17 per share
	• Adjusted EBITDA1 increased 45 percent to $125.7 million
	• Trailing Twelve Month Adjusted EBITDA increased 26% to $523.3 million
	• Net cash provided by operating activities increased $147.3 million to $115.0 million
	• Free Cash Flow1 increased $127.8 million to $67.7 million
	• Total debt decreased $1.8 billion or 52% to $1.7 billion driven by the proceeds generated in the company's initial public offering, related recapitalization, and Free Cash Flow1 generation
	• Net Debt1 decreased $1.7 billion or 53% to $1.5 billion
	• Net Debt1 / Trailing Twelve Month Adjusted EBITDA1 improved 62 percent to 2.9x

2021 full year outlook:
Revenue: $5.475 - $5.575 Billion
Capital Expenditures: $235 million
Adjusted Earnings per Share: $0.73 - $0.76

**Potential June Short Squeeze:**

The price has been artificially deflated by short sellers and Petco is now the 17th most shorted stock on the market. It has more short interest than most meme stocks, and it would take shorts more than 7 trading days to cover, with average volume. 

The price target for fair value is at least $6 from the current price, so even without a squeeze there's some deep value here. Remember, DFV bought $12 calls and that small expected gain turned into a fortune. There seems to be a similar set-up here. 

But the story gets really interesting when you look at the options flow. There's a HUGE volume of $30 calls expiring 6/18, so someone has made a very large bet that the price will be at least $8 higher a week from now. If the price manages to break above $30 before next Friday, it will cause more forced buying and potentially trigger a ""mini-squeeze"". Someone has taken a dim view of pet supply companies, because another mini-squeeze happened last week with $PETS and no-one noticed. 


**Timing and playing this stock**

I'm playing it by getting calls in between the price and my $28 target, long dated. So far I have September, but I'll keep accumulating longer expiry calls. I'm expecting a sharp decline in the market on Thursday 10 June 2021, so I'll add more then, but I've already got some calls just in case the wider sell-off doesn't impact this stock. $19 was the last support zone, but it looks like $22 is supporting it now. Anything below $22 is an instant buy for me. 22-24 is an acceptable entry point.

**Edit**
I forgot to mention the stock offering on the 28th of May. It's also partly why the stock dropped at that time, as they set a sell price of $24, which beat down the price below 24, and which lead to more declines last week. But it looks like the new stock was absorbed by the market and $WOOF has found it's new support at 22.

**Edit #2** this was at $22.30 when I posted. Now $23.27.

**Edit #3 - 9 June** full disclosure, I took off about 75% of my risk with this one ahead of tomorrow's CPI print. Too much uncertainty. I've left 25% of my position in case it moons in response. Will check out tomorrow's price action and try to find a place to re-enter. Also, more WOOF shares will be released 13 July 2021, so my time horizon with this play just got shortened."

-They already need a bailout and haven't produced a single (working) vehicle, yet. 


-They were misleading about preorders.


They would need a miracle to get to production, and another to continue long enough to become profitable.

Might as well put your money in their truck and watch it set itself on fire after 10 minutes."

**Infrastructure Bill,** just remember for any bill to pass the Senate it will likely end up being pared down significantly. Curious though, exactly what do you think this bill will benefit RIDE? They are already eligible for the $7,500 tax credit. The ATVM additional funding proposal was to prioritize medium and heavy-duty vehicles (pickup trucks are light-duty). The retooling of dormant facilities... well without knowing specifics who is to say that LMC would even be eligible for that. Not saying the infrastructure bill is not bullish for LMC and anyone trying to make EV's in general, but by the time we get to a final bill, don't expect much.

The rest... Well when they start production in September will believe it.

2021-06-14 13:40:02,wallstreetbets,Somebody posted a response from Context Logix investor relations last week stating that the correct date for the lockup expiry was  May 18th.
2021-06-14 19:16:03,wallstreetbets,"You could buy the stock. I know, I know... it's WSB we buy Options here. I'm just saying at this price range it's an option, plus then you don't have to worry about expiry."
2021-06-14 07:48:29,wallstreetbets,Did you take super huge risks in the beginning? How'd you go up that much from 3K?
2021-06-14 09:05:30,wallstreetbets,We will be at $25 soon enough. Buying anywhere around here will make us a very nice profit over the next few months.
2021-06-14 13:03:15,wallstreetbets,"You gotta risk to win. Investing $1k on a good stock can easily net you $3k. Pay yourself half, then invest $1.5k on another. Etc. 
As you make more, invest more.
(Not financial advice, just basic economics)."
2021-06-14 13:39:42,wallstreetbets,"If you had $1K right now, what specific investment would you make to try and get it to $3K or so? Just asking because I'm curious."
2021-06-14 18:36:52,wallstreetbets,"1k you'd have to day trade to make 3k fast, find stocks with a high float and watch the market during open and close and keep an eye on it every day multiple times a day. I've turned 1500 into around 4k in the last 6 or so months, realistically last 2 or 3 but I started with 200 or 300 6 months and kept adding a little bit here and there and moving it around where I thought the money would be."
2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$F puts are the move because Jim Cramer said the opposite. Overbought and riding high trend? Check.
Jim Cramer said they will defeat Tesla? Check.
My Ford Explorer broke down when I was on my way to get McDonald’s ten years ago? Check.

I bought in same day as I saw this: https://www.thestreet.com/.amp/jim-cramer/why-jim-cramer-likes-tesla-but-ford-is-his-pick

$14/$15 $f puts, some expire this week others expire in a month. 300 in total.

None of this is financial advice. Will let you guys know how it goes."
2021-06-13 23:49:08,wallstreetbets,Could go up though
2021-06-14 10:46:02,wallstreetbets,Time to inverse WSB on $F lol
2021-06-14 01:08:31,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I just bought a call. Average ape can’t get a whole pass here."
2021-06-14 09:39:44,wallstreetbets,Better know as the Cramer Effect. Whatever Jim Cramer says to do. Just do the opposite! Works 85% of the time. I say that could be a fairly good return. He told everyone to sell RAD at $7.50. I loaded up and still own it. I'm up over 200. He said to sell AMD years ago back when it was in the $9's and look at it now. Cramer talks in code for the Big Money boys that he used to work with at Goldman Exlax!
2021-06-13 23:57:17,wallstreetbets,Inverse Cramer is the way.
2021-06-13 23:52:47,wallstreetbets,"F going up.  On a Sunday.

2021-06-14 01:46:28,wallstreetbets,"Ford firing on all cylinders (and circuits) right now Bro! Way too many positive catalysts. Mustang Mach e doing very well, Bronco off the charts, Electric F-150 coming, etc. I just recently bought a Shelby GT-350 Cobra and it's the funnest car I've ever driven. 

Take whatever Cramer says with a grain of salt, but not everything he says is bullshit. I am long 3000 shares from the low 7's and anticipate another double from here in the next year or two."

2021-06-14 08:43:08,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-14 09:42:18,wallstreetbets,"Damn, Ford is at15? Last time I checked they were just passing 10. Probably should have put a bit of money in it back then."
2021-06-14 08:07:15,wallstreetbets,Its ford so no matter how bullish analysts are they will figure a way to fuck it up.  Play is probably to wait till next year when we find out their EV vehicles have some fatal flaw to it and they have to recall them.  Company is always cutting corners to stay price competitive since they have what like 2500 dollars of cost built into every vehicle from just pension payments alone.
2021-06-14 00:48:14,wallstreetbets,"Anyway,

I would like to see this go down again so I can buy more before blast off, because I'm cheap and greedy."

More of a long term issue, but if they can’t get high sales in their other models they’re fucked"
2021-06-14 03:30:12,wallstreetbets,Ford is releasing some cheap EVs and hybrids and in 2022 new EV trucks. I don't wanna bet against them. Just a feel nothing else.

2021-06-14 08:52:41,wallstreetbets,"You think they can sell a fully loaded EV for a similar price to their ICE F150?... their tech is good but they’re new to the game, they’re costs are not that low. Not to say they won’t get lower, that’s how battery tech works. But atm there is no way they have even okay margins at 45k per vehicle.

Ford is clearly hoping to sell the flagship truck at a loss to get people interested in their EV line up while making money on other models. It’s not a new idea but I think they are over estimating how popular their other models will be. The Mach-e is a hit in Europe but sales are low everywhere else and other models don’t seem too promising."

2021-06-14 01:48:36,wallstreetbets,"Oh man, my brain says no way!, but your counterpoint video said to my heart hell yeah!. I own a Ford Mustang btw, I don't promise anything but I'll see if I make an entry."
2021-06-14 01:31:20,wallstreetbets,I knew I shoulda stocked up at $2
2021-06-14 11:44:55,wallstreetbets,"Congrats. I've been so tempted to get one while they're still somewhat obtainable.  Definitely a future classic. Hope you enjoy it and don't keep it a garage queen.  Unfortunately for me to get one, I'd have to part with my manual v wagon which seems to also just keep climbing in value.  Still, it's pretty likely the 350 will be the greatest Mustang ever built."
2021-06-14 10:38:59,wallstreetbets,"Lmao companies do not sell products at a loss. Idiots always wanna say they do but no, ford is in the Business of making money. They sell cars for more money than they cost to make. That's their business model. 

U sound like the people saying Xbox and PlayStation don't make money selling consoles."
2021-06-14 02:01:10,wallstreetbets,I’ve made good money off Ford. It’s built tough.
2021-06-14 12:00:08,wallstreetbets,"CTS V Wagon? Wow! Have always loved those caddies. Definitely driving the 350. That was part of my decision making in making the purchase. If I spent twice the money on a 911 turbo or similar I would have been scared to drive it. Also the insurance is way cheaper. I think I'm only paying $1,100 for 6 months and since I live in Michigan it'll probably be stored most of the other 6 months. Lovin' it so far. Needed to get some classic American V8 muscle before the effin things are outlawed. My ""white"" barchetta, lol."
2021-06-14 10:56:34,wallstreetbets,"So Ford magically has good margins on theIr second EV when they’ve always had average margins on ICE? If you think they’re making sustainable money on the lightning with the trim level that’s been marketed you’re clearly the idiot. They are loosing money on this truck, I’m not even factoring in R&D or production ramps. 

Also, you saying companies don’t sell products at a loss is completely false. Maybe vehicle manufacturers don’t do this, but it’s actually very common. And Ford is trying it out in 2022 when they drop the lightning, their only hope is that they can get production costs down dramatically in these next few years."
2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,1 month ago I received a lot of hatorade for posting ~$387k worth of losses. I promised I’d post again. This is for those that doubt their positions.

Robinhood is the worst platform and chances are they’ll disable buying once again when you’re ready to sell and your inna have to cry as you watch the share price dip further away from where you wanted to sell. Remember these bastards are so lazy with buying. They do IOUs and then when it’s time to buy they’re at heavy loss since the price is much higher than what it was on the IOU they gave you when you bought in. Do yourself a favour, I hope."

Can I just point out that if you have a gain of 485% after a loss of 387k in loses it means you sold as well at some point.  Otherwise your gain would be no more than 50% now.  It is just math."
2021-06-14 11:51:16,wallstreetbets,"""Believe in your DD.""

More like: Gamble and hope you fall within probability where it works out.

2021-06-14 10:30:09,wallstreetbets,"Back in January, all I could afford was 12 shares of GME (net cost 189) and 180 of AMC (net cost 11).

Sold the GME for net of 294, sold 170 of the AMC for net of 27. 

I’ve got 100 of SOFIW, 10 of AMC, 150 of WKHS and a bid in for 100 of CLNE. 

I held the AMC and GME shares while my husband told me I was crazy to have bought them, as they both dropped HARD. He started to rethink his position when I told him that my portfolio went from about 2300 to now about 7000, in five months. 

If you like the the stock AND are in it to make money, decide on your selling point. Sell when it gets there, and buy something else at a lower cost. You’ll have more shares. And then you can watch that stock go up and down and eventually up to where you want to sell it. 

If you were listening to a place like the Motley Fool, they’re all over stocks that go up 20% in five years. I’m old. I don’t have the time to wait. Neither do you. But I bet you have a longer horizon that me, right?"

2021-06-14 04:50:19,wallstreetbets,Get out of robinhood bro why are you still using it?
2021-06-14 02:17:01,wallstreetbets,I am not giving him anymore.
2021-06-14 07:23:12,wallstreetbets,That’s what I do he setup a recurring payment into my RH account $1700/week & my wife is happy 😆 I’m retarded but getting richer
2021-06-14 09:56:47,wallstreetbets,That’s what I call passive income homie
2021-06-14 10:10:54,wallstreetbets,Can you be my rich wife’s bf so I can all in meme stocks
2021-06-14 10:38:04,wallstreetbets,Is this gme or AMC?
2021-06-14 10:56:22,wallstreetbets,He said no

2021-06-14 11:14:19,wallstreetbets,"Dude you went in with 100k, anyone could make half a mil after that. SMH"
2021-06-14 13:07:50,wallstreetbets,"That's fucked up. As a cuckold you need to support him, not the other way around. What's the point of even having a wife with a bf if you don't pay for his stuff?"
2021-06-14 15:45:36,wallstreetbets,I bet his wife’s BF won’t let him spend it on stocks.
2021-06-14 16:38:43,wallstreetbets,I tried...... he broke too. I’m gonna ask her BFs GF and maybe that will work.

2021-06-14 10:32:09,wallstreetbets,It adds context to how rich this dude probably is outside of trading. Most people don't have 20k lying around solely to invest in a meme stoci

2021-06-14 14:01:51,wallstreetbets,There is no buying dips or averaging down in options you retard

2021-06-14 00:34:39,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people, for all their talk, don’t have the stomach for such a position. They’ll ride a rally but panic and sell when it drops and then try to convince everyone that it’s over"

2021-06-14 10:51:46,wallstreetbets,"That’s actually LITERALLY what they can do. In the app they can take away your ability to press a button and sell. They’ve done it twice already, actually more, but twice made the big news."

And specifically with the meme stocks they fucked people over by disabling the buy button so they still artificially tanked the stock prices. Which again, actively works against OP's positions. 

Honestly they are probably fake anyway. If OP put that money in a real brokerage account he'd have access to tons of perks, a private banker, and actual best execution instead of shit PFOF."

Because that's a neat bit of trivia, but it's meaningless. If they didn't just happen to own a fuckton of the float by random happenstance, they would've done the same thing everyone else did. The big brokers have pretty identical risk practices.

It was literally just random luck that they happened to have lower risk on GME than other brokers. If you think Fidelity is the ""moral broker"" or whatever, you're being naive.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Vaxart — Next Novavax; Delta spike signals the 🚀 about to 🧨 In a nut shell, this company has figured out how to make vaccine pills, which are much cheaper to manufacture and easier to transport and distribute than shots, especially because they don’t need freezers, which can be hard to come by in many parts of the world (like India!). Also, most people aren’t masochists who want shots and you can’t put iRNA into pills so the conspiracy theorists can’t squawk (as much) about them. They already have vaccines for covid, flu, norovirus, and are developing others.

This stock has been behaving a lot like Novavax was about 18-15 months ago. It’s had a few major spikes and then drops, but really steady climbs the last two weeks. 

Strong insider buying and holding of stocks. Several institutions buying stock in the last few months, and now media coverage has begun, which spiked it 30% Friday. 

When it was in the 6.5 range, it was heavily shorted, with 🌈🐻 screaming it would go back to $5 by the end of May (it didn’t). 20% of shares are still shorted, and those 🌈🐻gotta be starting to panic with the recent climbs.

Options interest has increased massively in the last week. Delta is up on ITM and NTM July 16 calls from like .05ish to .5-.7 in just two days. 

Novavax had very similar stats from mid-March to early May 2020, when it had been trading sidewise between 13-17/share. It had a spike to 19, dropped back to 17 for about a week, then two days after its month-out calls saw that same Delta spike from .05-.1 to .5-.7 it went up 250% into the mid 40s... people thought they’d won there. It now trades in the 200s. 

TL;DR: Vaxart is gonna 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 very very soon. 

Not investment advise, I’m a retard, but me and my smooth brain are going to be loading up on MORE July 16 calls tomorrow morning. Already got 100. (Loading up more UWMC and WISH too).

I’d post an image to prove my positions but, being a retard, can’t figure out how to put them in a text post. If anyone with more brain wrinkles wants to walk me through it (preferably with crayon drawings) will be happy to edit them into this post.

EDIT:

Worth adding, Vaxart has also has doubled its employee count in the last three months, and it built a skybridge linking its building to Jansen’s building. If anyone can think of a reason they’d do that other than a partnership, I’d love to hear theories.

EDIT 2: 

As of now (14/06/2021) 36 million shares are shorted; only 3% shortable shares left. Most sold when it hit 10 last Friday. If we can get stock to 10 and hold it there through a few weeks of psychological tug-of-war sideways trading, then those shorts will all be OTM too long and will start covering fast and hard.

Their govt pulled a Trump and thought they had close to 0 cases when in fact they were doing close to 0 testing. Now they're screwed since the vaccine plants weren't running at even close to capacity since no one was buying.

That is despite 75% of participants in the phase 1 trial demonstrating a T-cell response.""](https://www.fool.com/premium/coverage/investing/2021/05/12/is-vaxart-a-buy/) Yes, the trial won't complete until Oct 2021, but this certainly doesn't look promising. Plus the vaccine is in such early stages of testing that even if they managed to get good results, the vaccine wouldn't available until 2022 or 2023. There's already a greater supply than demand for COVID vaccines now. Perhaps the T cells could help stave off variants better than current antibody-stimulating vaccines, but that's all speculation at this point."

2021-06-14 09:32:04,wallstreetbets,Twitter was at $41 at IPO in 2013. 25% in 8 years is incredibly bad.
2021-06-14 00:11:03,wallstreetbets,"Twitter user base:

2019: 139 Million  
2020: 192 Million  
2021: 353 Million"
2021-06-14 09:57:10,wallstreetbets,You need to spend more time learning about stonks.
2021-06-14 13:05:00,wallstreetbets,"Naw twitter makes one bad financial decision after another. Whatever happened to vine? That one was massive, twitter bought it and poof nothing out of it. Twitter has a cool platform but they have to change management to actually generate some money."

2021-06-14 00:08:09,wallstreetbets,Hard to swallow truth. Amc doesn’t offer last 20 million shares the stock would be 100+. That being said I’m still bullish and will continue to hold.

2021-06-14 00:15:52,wallstreetbets,I'm sorry I have drank a few and so is this actually him knocking over his camera and exposing that he is not wearing pants or am I missing a meme?

2021-06-13 22:11:32,wallstreetbets,"Don't know why everyone latched on to this CEO, he gives off a snake vibe. Hopefully this guy doesn't sell more shares and tank the stock. AMC would have hit $100+ if they didn't decide to dilute."
2021-06-13 23:47:18,wallstreetbets,"Why did the CEO give himself a massive bonus before taking care of a lot of the minimum wage, out of work employees?"

2021-06-13 23:45:04,wallstreetbets,Of course it is. He would do literally anything for Reddit to hold AMC.

2021-06-14 07:54:58,wallstreetbets,Sell now and rebuy at $69
2021-06-14 01:11:48,wallstreetbets,Wsb way buy high sell lower
2021-06-14 05:30:55,wallstreetbets,are you telling my story?
2021-06-14 14:46:22,wallstreetbets,Ah I see we use the same trading strategy.
2021-06-14 15:58:00,wallstreetbets,Yes. You are doing this exactly in their favor. Keep going😎
2021-06-14 01:05:04,wallstreetbets,Yeah he pissed on our parade
2021-06-14 01:23:50,wallstreetbets,Holding strong with you. Can’t wait for Friday when those shorts are due.
2021-06-14 09:00:54,wallstreetbets,zero evidence that would be the case

2021-06-14 03:44:31,wallstreetbets,"Nope, that's about it honestly. Thus the 'exposed naked shorts' theory lol"
2021-06-13 22:46:47,wallstreetbets,Well shit look at what leadership did to the company before the pandemic. Was going down the tubes for awhile....this guy is just glad some retards decided to bail his ass out of an over leveraged company. This guy is the luckiest schmuck out there
2021-06-14 01:36:14,wallstreetbets,You mean their entire leadership was selling their stock? These people don’t give a shit about us.
2021-06-14 01:17:12,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure they have less than 50k shares left to sell
2021-06-14 05:30:30,wallstreetbets,"I mean the point (or benefit) of shares having a certain value is for that company to do a secondary offering in the future, and AMC is just exercising the benefit. The purpose of shares or equity market is always to raise capital (from the company side).

I think it is actually more crazy if selling shares is not on the menu. The company is in dire need of money more than ever (hedge fund “bet” is basically the company ran out of money and therefore collapsed). So it is more like they will eventually dilute it, just a matter of when."
2021-06-13 23:35:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah I don't get a good vibe from him
2021-06-14 05:22:52,wallstreetbets,"you realize them selling shares FUNDAMENTALLY changed the FUNDAMENTAL analysis

them being recapitalized makes them a completely different company that is stronger and better

right?

well anyway, $1 billion down, $4 billion to go

expect sales."
2021-06-14 00:28:34,wallstreetbets,They latched  on because theyre being pandered to and they aren't smart enough to figure it out. They're being played by one of the shittiest CEOs out there to the tune of 10s of millions of dollars
2021-06-14 03:14:51,wallstreetbets,"The company has a huge amount of debt, of course he's going to do it again. He only sucks up to 'apes' because he knows when the rug gets pulled he's back to square 1.   
He is shady as fuck, I wouldn't be surprised if he is investigated by the sec once this is all over. Totally different approach than GME."
2021-06-14 03:23:16,wallstreetbets,"Dude, they have to do it. AMC is in a bad spot and doing this can save them. AMC, while a meme, isn’t a safe company to invest in simply because of their financials. It’s why so many jumped to blackberry, gme, and others."
2021-06-14 03:15:21,wallstreetbets,"You know CEO is the career with the highest proportion of psychopaths right? Be wary of any CEO, especially ones pretending to be your friend"

2021-06-14 07:08:04,wallstreetbets,Glad to know I'm not the only one who thinks this.  I wasn't a fan of this interview.
2021-06-14 00:02:25,wallstreetbets,for money
2021-06-14 00:11:03,wallstreetbets,Thats what hood CEO's do. Reduce costs so they make their numbers and get their bonus.
2021-06-14 00:28:57,wallstreetbets,"Because it's a lot harder to lower wages then reduce other costs.

Somebody popping popcorn and giving change is not in high demand and it's not a highly sought after job for skilled workers. Anyone can do it and it's usually high school kids who do.

The best benefit a kid gets for working at a theater is work experience.

If you've got skills AMC can really use I'm certain there's better paying jobs in their corporate office."

2021-06-14 01:25:02,wallstreetbets,AND they sold those directly to a hedge fund who immediately sold them the same day for a profit. I like the stock but AMC management is not your friend.

And a failing business model.

Don't get me wrong, there will always be movie theaters in big cities. I think a lot of smaller cities, towns, and other areas are going to have theirs go out of business.

It's like malls. There will always be malls in LA, NYC, and Chicago. In places like Mobile Alabama, that shit is going out of business."

Demand is high enough to need them in every movie theater though. 

You are probably the same kind of person who is now surprised that people are leaving food service jobs and not returning for minimum wage which after inflation is even less than they were making in 2019."

2021-06-14 07:06:18,wallstreetbets,"Ya which is at the lower end of the spectrum of when people enter the labor force and only a small fraction of employed workers earn minimum wage.

So what's your fucking point? That someone popping popcorn and pouring soda is worth more? Bc they're not."
2021-06-14 07:25:48,wallstreetbets,"The only people who would say that with a straight face have never paid someone a wage, especially teenagers, never balanced a budget or worried about keeping the lights on.

A liveable wage is relative to it's value, real wage, and only exists if there's any value in that wage. You're not entitled to the value of someone else's labor.

A miniscule fraction of teenagers are worth anything more then minimum wage and most of them are athletes."
2021-06-14 08:34:51,wallstreetbets,"They are in high school - they don't need a ""livable wage"" - which, BTW, is a completely arbitrary standard that everyone throws around without considering what it really means - when, and where."
2021-06-14 09:46:07,wallstreetbets,">Demand is high enough to need them in every movie theater though. 

Umm that's not true at all but if it were then that will be reflected in their wage rate because of market demand. Demand ⬆️ wages⬆️. I used emojis to make it simple for you 

>You are probably the same kind of person who is now surprised that people are leaving food service jobs and not returning for minimum wage which after inflation is even less than they were making in 2019.

Don't try to get personal with me. And again that's not true, inflation is way way up and depending on the metric could be up 13% to 15%. CPI alone is up 5% YoY and that excludes a lot of factors bc economists deemed it ToO CoMpLiCaTeD.

And if you're referring to people not returning to work bc UI benefits pay better, well that's true and it's also inorganic wage growth. Full employment can cause rampant inflation and UI is mimicking full employment and competing with market driven efficiencies.

The only people that really lose in this environment is the middle class. The poor don't really benefit bc real wage growth is non existent and the wealthy can simply reallocate.

These are some of the simplest concepts in economics. Try reading a book before shooting off your mouth."
2021-06-14 09:47:04,wallstreetbets,"it is as simply as reading amc press releases lol. they can't legally sell more than46k shares in 2021. just a fact, even if you seem to dislike facts lol"

2021-06-14 11:32:28,wallstreetbets,"Oh dear God, do you understand how ironic it is to argue against capitalism on a sub that celebrates it's potentiality?

None of what's happening here is possible without capitalism.

I mean do you understand how flawed your logic is? You are not entitled to anyone's money or resources just as they are not entitled to yours."
2021-06-14 10:34:47,wallstreetbets,"That's just it, it's about productivity.

Money isn't personal, skills and wages have nothing to do with the person. It's all about market demand.

If Elon Musk were behind the counter selling Skittles, snowcaps and pretzels that wouldn't mean he deserves anymore then what the market will bear for that job.

You could be a NASA engineer, an NBA superstar, high profile lawyer ECT... It simply isn't relevant to what your wage is unless the market will pay it."
2021-06-14 10:42:38,wallstreetbets,"The definition of a ""livable wage"" is exactly what I said it was - arbitrary - and, it's likely to remain that way considering all the different variables one needs to consider to even come close to defining what it would be.

Could you somehow calculate the cost of living for a specific area, throw in some exceptions and expectations on variability, and build some sort of ""base standard"" that could be used to calculate a ""livable wage"" in any area you use that formula in? Perhaps; but, I'm not aware of any one system that has been thought of that meets those criteria. There's a reason it's always up for debate, but, the only ""solution"" people can come up with is ""raise wages"" while dismissing every other factor involved, and the knock-on effects of that ""solution"".

As I have stated in many discussions before - if you are beyond, or even well beyond, your teens\\early twenties, and still making minimum wage, you messed up somewhere. There are millions of open positions out there - most making far more than ""minimum wage"" - that are up for grabs, with many of them requiring little more than proof of work experience, and easily obtainable skills.

I find the argument that everyone should just be paid an arbitrary ""livable wage"" without an actual defined standard of what that even means as a way of saying ""people should just make as much money as they desire, to live the lifestyle they've chosen, without actually having to become experienced, skilled, or work for it"".

That's a simplification; but, I'm sure you get the point - if you want to be paid more, then you need to work for it. That means improving your skills (or learning new ones), recognizing the value of experience (even if it's not your ""dream job""), pursuing the betterment of yourself so that you are inherently worth paying more for your value to the workforce, and, more important than all of those, being willing to work your ass off to achieve your goals. If you don't play, you don't win - doesn't matter if you like the rules of the game or not.

Mike Rowe talks a lot about this topic; and, while he is not just my ""go to"" for my thoughts on the subject, he is one of the easiest sources to recommend to people to check out. Hard work, pays off; and, your value to the workforce is not inherent or entitled - it is earned.

If you want to increase that value, then follow the money as it were. You are simply not worth $15/hr \[or even less in many places\] if all you can do is flip burgers (an example that can be used for many no skill\\low skill jobs)."

My logic & gut says that if they are serious about stabilizing above the low-teens where they started, they are going to do what placates the 'big player' share holders.

2021-06-14 07:13:06,wallstreetbets,"I have seen this argument many times as some kind of counter too AMC doing bad before the pandemic. And it is a useless argument. There is lots of companies that have failed in a sector that is thriving. 

And specific counters to your reasoning about storytelling. 

AMC has primarily big theaters best suited for blockbusters that have little to no storytelling and is published by the giants. And Disney has already started to pull away from releasing to theaters or at least giving them less exclusivity, this is a fucking disaster for AMC because without blockbusters or even just a small reduction in access too them they are fucked. 

Their profit margin is very small and they need something like 85% capacity just to break even. So even if they started running indi or smaller films they would still be fucked because the locations they have are too big and not enough people care about movies as an artform. 

AA got like a 20m bonus after the first runup in January so he probably cant wear pants because the massive hardon he gets every time he thinks about the bonus he can get if this mania keeps going on long enough."

Why do you keep mentioning kids as the only demographic to work minimum wage?

The whole concept of a minimum wage was for a living wage thats literally what it was formed for. The minimum wage didn't come into existence for any other reason why do you keep ignoring that.

The purpose of the minimum wage was to stabilize the post-depression economy and protect the workers in the labor force. The minimum wage was designed to create a minimum standard of living to protect the health and well-being of employees.

Hows that for reality."

2021-06-13 22:47:14,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-14 16:50:29,wallstreetbets,"You want reality? The real minimum wage is zero. That's an economic fact.

And we are not in a depression nor a recession, we are in a roaring bull market with lots of growth being priced in. So if your point is that minimum wage was too alleviate the pressure that the depression caused wouldn't the same logic apply in a good economy and minimum wage be lowered? Or is this just a one way street so you can fool yourself into thinking you can afford more expensive shit?

And apx 1% of all workers earn at or below minimum wage. So let's keep this in perspective and not use your inflammatory information which is very misleading.

statistics about people working near minimum wage is completely irrelevant. When a carpenters helper makes $9 bucks in Idaho or Nebraska it's a lot different then a Starbucks barista in NYC.

Near minimum wage can go a long way in the majority of the country. It covers a wide swath of people. And that's what really matters, the real wage that they take home and is usable to purchase goods and services. It wouldn't matter if it's $1 hr, if it meets their needs that's what matters. 

It's about value not quantity.

Also a lot of near minimum wage workers are in fact teenagers. And the most valuable thing they can gain from a job is experience. That's also a fact. Same goes for low skilled workers. The thing they need most is experience.

Experience is also directly related to innovation. See Rothbard*

So want to keep playing with numbers? Ok let's do it. When you raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which BTW has no basis in any economic reality besides being a number that's easily marketable to the naive, you get problems with low skilled workers and the poor being priced out of markets. Because yes that's what price floors do.

Want another number? $26,500. That's the federal poverty line. $15 an hour happens to be just enough to raise people to barely above the federal poverty level. Making them ineligible for benefits that are far more valuable then a few bucks an hour. 

But here's who really suffers, the middle class? Why well bc all of a sudden skilled workers are seeing their real wage deteriorate because unskilled workers are taking a larger portion of profits all while costs are rising. The middle class is most affected by inflation. Remember corporate profits average about 4% at net. Labor is almost always the largest cost any business has. And all of a sudden there is less for them. For those who attended college or developed skills and relationships over the years. They are the ones getting screwed. But no surprise there huh?

The wealthy don't suffer from a minimum wage increase because they simply pass the cost along. They also are actively encouraging it bc it hurts their competition, small businesses, which account for about half of all employed people.

Why do you think Amazon is so supportive of minimum wage increases? The goodness of their hearts? No, it's a corporation it doesn't have a heart. It has a fiduciary responsibility to produce profits, nothing else.

Remember that part about the poor being priced out of markets? Well that's what it looks like.

Know what else happens? Businesses choose not to hire low skilled workers so they are not as readily able to gain job experience. Yep job experience is that valuable.

But yay let's raise minimum wage bc it removes people from the welfare roles and artificially raises GDP. Figure out who wins yet? The wealthy and politicians bc if you ever picked up the most basic book about economics you would know that MV=PQ=GDP. If you know what that means then you know what raising minimum wage does.

So seriously want to go down this road because you have no clue what you are talking about."

* **Institutional ownership of 20%** on the from the 32.5M shares (about 6M)
* The exact Short interest of the float is really hard to find for today's date. As of may 28th, 5.68M was short on the Free Float of 32.5M. (152M shares are currently locked up for 6 months)
* **However the daily short volume in the past few days has been WAY higher: 40-50% of the volume is short!**

* **The cost to borrow IS INSANE** and is an indicator and its hard to find shares to short! There aren't many shares to short because most investors are super long on this stock. So shorts are paying huge amounts. **For reference, AMC has a cost of borrow of 4%.**

&#x200B;

* **Ortex shows a cost of borrow of 161% for LEV, on my broker the cost to short is 130%!** This is **INSANE**. It basically means that a movement of price towards the upside will be very hard for shorts to sustain and will force them to cover very fast.

* To short 1 share: pay 7cents a day. To short 10k shares = pay 700$ a day.
* Lastly, the stock has been on the very nice upwards movement looking at the daily chart after cooling off from the recent peak of 23.5. If we break through the 24s we have a very nice short at seeing the 30s like earlier this year.

* Huge project to **open the biggest heavy-medium EV manufacturing plant in Illinois**, operational as of mid-2022 with a maximum production capacity of 20 000 vehicles a year. [With the support the the governor and tax a tax abatement deal for 5 years](https://patch.com/illinois/joliet/joliet-property-tax-abatement-lion-electric-promises-1-418-jobs). You can bet your ass that this will be supported as ""made in America""
* New battery manufacturing site ready as of 2023 to produce up to 14 000 batteries a year for they vehicles. **Funded by BOTH the Federal and the Provincial governments in Canada (fund of $100M)**
* **Employee numbers continuing to grow, now over 650 and recruitment continues**

# Deals and connections

* The list of partnerships with big companies continues to grow
* **Amazon** purchased 10 trucks last year and has a contract with Lion to purchase up to 2500 trucks by 2025.
* **Amazon** also has the possibility to own about 15% of LION electric if they spend 1.1B on the trucks. And there is a high probability that they will (see below)
* [Pride](https://www.electrive.com/2021/03/28/pride-orders-100-electric-trucks-from-lion-electric/)(big truck enterprise) as a purchase order of 100 trucks = potential for more orders if product is liked
* **IKEA**
* **CN** (huge Canadian transporter) recently [Purchased 50 trucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15U4DjRLkqA&t=41s&ab_channel=LionElectric) \- again there is a chance to increase size of order later
* First student with 260 buses for QUEBEC only. Guess what? they own 43 000 buses across Canada and USA which will slowly need to be changed into EV.
* Deal with **Heritage** for 100 Refuse EV trucks

# How is the quality?

* A Canadian firm (Desjardins) which has a PT of 26$ short term and up to 40$, says that they contacted 10 big fleets of school buses for their DD and that Lion has is the best on the market
* Twin Rivers Director of Fleet operations calls the buses the ""Rolls Royce and the Tesla of school buses"": [link](https://youtu.be/StpnGrItO4E?t=45)
* **California** is a big fan of Lion electric almost all of the funded EV school buses are awarded to Lion:
* Lion just visited the capitol and continues to tie links with the state

# FINALLY AMAZON:

# Do they like the trucks? Operations Manager at Amazon recently shared the truck on LinkedIn and the reactions were all positive. Stated that ""GREAT ADDITTION and MANY MORE TO COME""

**TLDR**:

* Huge growth EV company with clear plans and goals + cash on hand
* Supported by Canadian and USA government with funds and tax abatement
* Top class in EV school bus sector with the trucks growing popularity rapidly
* Key customers (Amazon, IKEA, Pride, CN...)
* Decent amount of short (5.86M+/38M) but likely MUCH higher in past few days
* INSANE cost to short the shares (130-160%!) since all shares are in the hands of longs = shorts will have to cover FAST =🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Potential plays:

* Shares will be safest
* If you wanna go big 20-25 calls for July should be the best play

EDIT: Price down 7% today as of writing this. No bad news or whatsoever. Volume is trash and maybe shorted after RIDE news since this is also an EV spac. Not worried at all though, will add more if it dips. The value play is insanely good"

2021-06-14 05:23:34,wallstreetbets,LEV is one of the best kept secrets on the market right now
2021-06-14 18:48:19,wallstreetbets,In a new filing today it reveals that Amazon now owns 18.8% of the company... And no news released yet

2021-06-14 03:00:17,wallstreetbets,"If you've been around the WSB block for longer than 2021, you'll note that WSB was already in long with LEV. Been in them once for the run up to $35 when Jim Cramer pumped it and sold for a profit, then re bought in again when it hit the lows. When she dips to near my average, I'm going back in."
2021-06-14 03:18:42,wallstreetbets,I bought it some months ago as a long term stock. But if you retards just send it to the moon well... Imma take my profit at the top 😈
2021-06-14 06:58:32,wallstreetbets,"I've been in since the spac, (almost bought at the top lol).While i don't think it'll fucking print money like JPOW i think it's a decent long term investment.

Why? 'cos if it wasn't i'd have to admit I'm wrong, and as of now, i'd prefer not to

Edit: i own 10 shares. I know, i'm fucking poor lol"
2021-06-14 09:16:00,wallstreetbets,I have been big on LEV for a while. They seem to have a really good product.

2021-06-14 00:51:34,wallstreetbets,"I am interested in dooo, but seeing price drop recently makes me wondering if it has peaked and going to much lower?"
2021-06-14 09:48:21,wallstreetbets,yeah lev is like one of the few former ev spacs not looking to make a quick buck
2021-06-14 09:49:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's a very legitimate company unlike many of the others. Their vehicle lineup seems to be expanding at a healthy rate and they also have the orders to backup their legitimacy.
2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Gold Continuous Month Contract - Front Month In Trading View, the continuous Front-Month for Gold - [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=COMEX%3AGC1!](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=COMEX%3AGC1!), shows the data for Aug 2021 (from what I can tell). It seems to match GC.00 from MarketWatch - [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/gc00](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/gc00) also matching Aug 2021. I don't understand why GC! in TradingView in June 2021 as the continuous front-month contract is for Aug 2021 or am I misreading something?

I understand that continuous contract represents a splicing of real contracts for consistency in historical trends, but is there a consistent roll-over or does each chart have a different roll-over of when they splice together? How does continuous contract differ from the front-month contract? I thought the front-month was always the next expiring month which generally is continuous showing the historical trend of the price of the immediately next expiring contract.

I would post in r/FuturesTrading but the trolls there don't let people post."
2021-06-13 22:05:01,wallstreetbets,"The trading view generic ticker you’re looking at is better for viewing historical price in the front month, as it constantly rolls.

Generic futures contracts can be tricky in how they’re displayed. The NYMX front month ticker is GC.1 if you want a rolling front month ticker on market watch (one that would  closely match Trading view. But each provider can roll their generic ticker at a different date so end of the month may differ. I.e. TradingView might roll their generic ticker on first notice day and MW on last trading day."

I thank you from the bottom of my heart regardless of the outcome of AMC. I feel it is a sturdy investment and I put stock in it. Whether it's long-term or short, at this point I don't know which path to take. There's other stocks that I like, like Nokia and nio electric vehicle car company. Those are my primary two points of interest. But that's another day. Right now #amc is my way.

2021-06-14 00:50:14,wallstreetbets,"Options can be traded just like stocks, and their price moves up and down just like stocks.

Options are contracts that grant the buyer to purchase (call) on a date or sell (put) on a date at a price.

Buying an option: you pay money for the right

Selling an option: you receive money for the obligation


The price of an option is a function of  A)the difference between strike price and actual current stock price B) remaining time to closure of contract C) volatility of underlying stock

(A bastardized summary of options)"

2021-06-13 23:58:24,wallstreetbets,Seconded. Can someone ELIF?
2021-06-14 00:30:21,wallstreetbets,"EDIT: read the reply to mine as well, as there is incorrect information in my post.

That money is what the OP already spent for the right to make a purchase of 100 shares should he or she choose to do so. That money is already gone and spent. However, the higher the price goes, the more money he will make up in return. 

For example, if the price stays above $40 but nothing else, he'll get what he spent on the $40 call plus whatever either RH chose to sell out the options for (I did a $42 option and I ended up with $50 return, so I earned $8 in total) or were this elsewhere he could truly hold the option for those sales until it reached higher.

Underneath the $40 it says 25 buys, so he bought the option to buy 100 shares 25 times.

If the price dips below $40 then all that money is gone.

Now, if the price goes to $50 then he can sell 100 shares (25 times) at $50 each. In his own reply he said he spend $11.65 per share, so imagine buying 100 shares at $11.65 each and selling them for $50.  Now multiply that by 25 (the number of contracts of 100 shares he purchased)."

Regardless, I’m just saying it’s a bit foolish.  How long till RH is sued into the ground?  I recommend a traditional broker.  Additionally, RH’s whole “democratizing the market” nonsense has been thoroughly debunked.  The value they added when they appeared in the scene no longer applies. You might as well go with a big guy at this point.  TDA/Fidelity > RH/Webull.  Again: I do not believe multimillionaires use RH.  I think it’s all posing.  (Just my O)."

2021-06-14 00:10:19,wallstreetbets,"No so they are option call contracts saying I am allowed to buy 100 shares at $40 on 6/18 IF I WOULD LIKE TO. Right now those contracts cost $11.65X100 =$1165 each contract. I have 25 of these contracts so 25x$1165=$29,125. This is the current value I have in contracts. I can buy and sell these contracts as the price fluctuates to gain money but say if the price falls to $39 on amc by Friday then these will be worth 0 but if the price rises you also gain more. Higher risk, higher reward. I’m not the best at explaining but that’s my shot at it. The number you are seeing is my total equity in that option strike price of $40."
2021-06-14 00:59:59,wallstreetbets,"He spent $11.65/share for the right to buy shares at $40. So if it goes to 50, that is 50 - 40 = 10 x 100 x 25 = $25,000 but he paid $29,125 (11.65 x 100 x 25). So he'd still lose money if it was exercised at $50 a share."
2021-06-14 02:29:59,wallstreetbets,Does he have to wait until Friday (I’m guessing that’s the expiration date) to exercise the option? Or could he do it once he was happy with the stock rising to a certain price?

2021-06-14 18:09:00,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm maybe i don’t understand. But the closer it gets to Friday the closer and closer his $73 call becomes worthless no?

2021-06-14 18:13:26,wallstreetbets,"You’re also right. As Friday approaches you have theta working against you, this will cause his contracts to become worthless if he holds too long. After Wednesday he’ll need more dramatic swings to make money. Such as today we saw some pretty wild swings +/- 5%. 

But if IV stays high and in turn delta also stays high the calls can still print. Again, depending on when he bought the calls. I think these contracts weren’t too bad last week so he might have gotten a good entry."

So for him he spent $11+ for the right to buy at 40 (so essentially $51+ purchased). It the closed at 50c above the total cost, that'd be half dollar for every share. 100 shares per contract so $50 per contract. 25 contracts is ...?  I can't math 25*$50."

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD NOK - Excellent Analysis from Yahoo Financials NOK thread  FOUR STAGE DIVIDEND RECOVERY CYCLE (posted 6-13-2021)  


1.	First  Stage---Disaster (Deteriorating fundamentals 1–2-years prior to dividend  elimination)  Shares decline 40 to 80 percent in value.   


2.	Second Stage----Crisis Management (1-2-years)   
Company  cuts spending, eliminates dividend, cash flow improves, improved  company prospects.  Shares still priced at a substantial discount to  pears.  


3.	The Third Stage----Financial Stabilization (3 years after dividend elimination)  
Company  can operate on the cash it receives from its customers.  Still not  earning anything for its shareholders.  However, survival is no longer  in doubt and investors who bought shares of the company in stage one or  two have doubled their money.   


4.	The Fourth Stage----Recovery (4 years after dividend elimination)   
Company  is capable of earning something for the shareholders and there is  reason to expect improved earnings and the reinstatement of the  dividend.  The shares have now quadruple from the low reached at the end  of stage one or sometime in stage two.  How things progress from here  depend on how competitive the company has become versus its peers.   


NOKIA’S FOUR STAGES   


1.	Nokia’s First Stage --- Disaster (2016-2018)   
Deteriorating  fundamentals, management’s fails to efficiently merge Alcatel-Lucent  with Nokia and develop competitive 5G products, company in danger of  losing its customer base.   


2.	Nokia’s Second Stage --- Crisis Management (2017 through 2020 )  
2017  Nokia institutes an austerity program and budget, July of 2019  eliminates. Dividend, March of 2020 shares decline to $2.54, 5G products  still not competitive, September 2020 loses $6 billion Verizon contract  to Samsung, yearend 2020 cash flow improving.  Nokia’s “second stage”  ended roughly at the  3-year mark from the ALU/NOK merger.  


3.	Nokia’s Third Stage --- Financial Stabilization (2021 through 2022)     
January  2021 Nokia is still not earning anything meaningful for its  shareholders, however, prospects have greatly improved. At the current  rate of improvement by the end of stage 3 around 8-01-2022 its survival  will no longer be in doubt and investors who bought shares of Nokia in  stage one or two most likely will have doubled or tripled their money.  


4.	Nokia’s Fourth Stage --- Recovery (2023-- four years after dividend elimination)  
If  all has gone well, Nokia is once again capable of earning something for  its shareholders and investors should expect improved earnings and the  reinstatement of the dividend.  At this stage, the shares have likely  quadrupled from the $2.54 low reached in March of 2020.  


The above  represents what some analysts call a “Four Stage Dividend Recovery  Cycle”.  It represents the likely timelines and share price performance  for a company that has executed a successful turnaround and reinstated  its dividend.  The timelines and stages are very common.  So far, Nokia  is tracking the timelines of the four stages very well.  In fact,  recently Nokia shares have broken a downtrend line that has existed for  21 years!  


Having a framework by which to judge a company’s  performance is essential to acquiring that company’s shares “Ahead of  The Crowd”.  ………...Tickerguy  


TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTALS IN AGREEMENT (Posted 5-18-2021)  


It  does seem Nokia is trending toward a higher market evaluation as a  result of its surprisingly good numbers in Q1 and the expectation by  some analysts that Nokia will revise its 2021 revenue and margin numbers   upward after it reports it Q2 results.  The company continues to make  excellent progress in the enterprise market and appears to be in a  position to receive some unexpected revenue from China if all goes well  over the next few months.    


Also, it chart pattern seems bullish.   The golden cross (50 day moving average crossing the 200 day moving  average) is viewed by chartist as bullish and in addition the 5 year  chart indicates a breakout to the upside with a price target above $6 a   share in the not to distant future (1 to 8 months).  


It has been  some time since Nokia's fundamentals and its technical price pattern  have been in agreement.  With the current downdraft in the market there  is a very small group of stocks that have resisted moving to the  downside and in fact have increased in price recently--Nokia is among  that group.  


At the moment the risk to reward matrix appears very  favorable for investors to expand current position or establish new  positions in Nokia ahead of its second quarter report and ""Ahead of The  Crowd"".  ........Tickerguy"

People talk shit about the quality of the items, but judging by the app/product reviews most people know what they’re getting themselves into. That’s why Wish hauls became a thing on YouTube, people can order a shit ton of stuff on there for like $50 and then the packages start rolling in a few weeks later after they basically forgot what they ordered. Another criticism is that since the pandemic is over they’re gonna lose business, but they fulfill a unique position in the market. People don’t usually buy on there instead of brick and mortar/Amazon, the shipping times are too long. As the economy improves people should have more disposable income to blow on Wish crap which may or may not end up being garbage, that’s part of the appeal. At least that’s what I gather, maybe I’m wrong. I’ve never used the service but I have used AliExpress."

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The yield curve, XLF, boom and bust (Not financial advice) The lowest point of a economic cycle is a inverted or flat yield curve, when the credit spreads are tight or negative between short end and long end of the yield curve and there is least incentive for banks to create money in the system through lending activity. This can be called the end of the late cycle and the beginning of the early cycle.

Once LT yields have reached a bottom, it begins to go up in anticipation of improving economic outlook. Yield begins to steepen and lending activity starts to pick up. The early cycle peaks when the yield curve is steepest and XLF is at all time. In this stage the economic outlook picks up and then peaks. No more upside surprises. The YC then peaks and starts flattening again. This marks the beginning of the mid cycle. When lending activity is still present in the economy, but it is falling. The YC peaks with the XLF. And as XLF rolls over, so does the market (usually!) since the moment calls for revision of the valuations broadly.

The middle cycle continues as long as the credit spreads in the YC is still decently positive. It ends when the YC is almost flat - marking the beginning of the late cycle.

Watch out for the XLF and the YC. If the YC and XLF has peaked, in traditional sense it might call for a correction. Not saying it has to happen, but it usually does. The correction from early cycle to mid cycle usually is ~ 15% to 20%.

These cycles used to happen over a longer period of time historically. But we live in an era of super fast business and financial cycles. Unnaturally so, because of Central Bank active intervention."

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The best way to position yourself in a market crash/inflation… So I’m not gonna dive really deep into this but there is a good possibility that we’re looking full face into another recession/market crash. Even Michael Burry is predicting it…(SEC made him shut down his Twitter account)

The first and best thing you can do to position yourself for being financially stable after a rocket ride to the moon is PAY OFF all of your debt. House, cars, cards, loans, etc…then you are slave to no man, woman, corporation etc…

Next i would strongly recommend establishing an emergency fund of 6-12 months of expenses…or more. If you have NO DEBT then this will be easier to accomplish. Choose what you want, Gold, cr$pto, silver, ammo, whatever will help pay the bills and protect you and yours.

Then (and I’m still doing my own DD) find some funds that are low risk, and increase with inflation. Also remember that interest rates are at an all time low right now! The ONLY place for them to go is UP!! So find some funds that give you gains as interest rates rise. 

Finally if you are able, wisely help others with your newfound wealth and abilities and NEVER NEVER NEVER forget where you came from and the sacrifices made for you, and by you on the way to the moon!

Please comment with any helpful info especially if you have DD on good funds that protect / help as mentioned above.

This is NOT financial advice it is life advice, from one crayon eating dumb money APE 🦍 to another. Peace and may the odds be ever in your favor!

Edit: I should have titled it “one way “Thanks everyone for the comments! After hearing from some of you about the value of debt in a recession I wanted to say I understand where your coming from as Apgar as paying off your mortgage with a less valued dollar is like paying less money for your original loan. It makes sense! The position I was coming from is specific calls related to owning something totally. Whether I lose my Job or have a huge pay decrease The house would still be mine with nothing more to pay. I’m tired of running on the hamster wheel where The bank owns me and I pay them. So I closing I stand by my original post and respect the opinions of everyone. There are many ways to do something the right way, some more efficient than others, but the relativity lies in different and diverse cogs that make up each persons individual variables."
2021-06-13 23:37:23,wallstreetbets,Just sell the day before the crash and buy when it hits the bottom and is about to go back up.

2021-06-13 23:22:14,wallstreetbets,"Be diversified. Find other investments that hold up better than stocks. I have been investing for 30 years and this is the hardest thing about parking money and letting it work for you without much risk.
Wine. Land. Commercial real Estate. Farms. Old muscle cars . Collectibles and art. Those are some things I am invested in to try to ease the pain of stock crashes. Those also provide passive income which is also hard to find assets that appreciate while you make annual
money from the investment."
2021-06-13 23:06:55,wallstreetbets,"Hodl on... If there'll be hyper-inflation, and if you have fixed interest on your debts (as you should), then wouldn't it make sense to pay them off **after** the dollar crashes? (I doubt it will, but I'm going along with your hypothesis here.)

So if you owe $40,000 - or the price of a new car, and if we get 100% inflation and the new car costs $80,000 - it's better to pay off the $40K loan then, since it'll cost you only half a car. :)"

2021-06-13 20:21:17,wallstreetbets,Market crash kinda depends on what your investing in also doesn’t.
2021-06-13 23:56:51,wallstreetbets,"Every couple of months the bears come out of hibernation and look at the market, higher than ever, and announce with full confidence that it's the end times.

Have some cash on hand, don't go balls deep in options, and make smart trades. IF inflation is going to be an issue, paying down low interest debt is about the last thing you want to do (unless you HAVE to) because you can park your money in an index fund and ride the inflation wave instead, like you said. 10% inflation gain > 5% interest. High interest you should be paying off ASAP either way (credit cards, for example).

Here's a counter-argument. Have you seen the $30T national debt? This is perhaps a golden opportunity to evaporate some of that burden, in which case, you should buy all the stock you can get your hands on because most of the money that's being printed it going straight to the market. The problem with running the economy so hot is that shit gets weird and companies continue to exist that SHOULD fail (I'm looking at you NKLA). In the short term, this is OK, but in the long term it stifles growth - it's like if everyone in the neighborhood were suddenly immortal, houses would never go up for sale and housing prices would rise. We're seeing the same thing now.

I don't think we have any major problems until September when many of the normal financial obligations for the average person resume. That might be a catalyst for something bigger, but who knows."
2021-06-13 23:44:11,wallstreetbets,The stock that Burry invested in for such crash was GME.
2021-06-13 22:58:13,wallstreetbets,"The market trying to stay afloat Is exactly why we are in this mess. The feds are so worried about the stock market tanking they’re doing everything they can to keep it from crashing and causing worldwide panic. 

It’s funny to see Wall Street continue to shit on retail investors and meme stocks because they lack the “fundamentals” to justify their crazy gains yet here we are at a time where unemployment still continues to be at an ATH, people are losing their entire livelihood because they have no jobs or can’t afford a decent living wage, and yet we continue to see stocks raising to new ATH. The market doesn’t care about the people it effected the hardest.


Additionally I’m tired of this “save for 6-12 months” bullshit. What’s the point? Apparently all those “jobs” that are in need for people desperately won’t hire you for an entry level position unlesss you’ve got a masters and 16 years experience before your 18th birthday for an entry level job, and will barely pay you what you ask for.  Fuck that. And, that emergency fund doesn’t account for the inflation you’re going to see continue to raise. So it’s going to be a never ending cycle of you trying to save up “for an emergency” because you’ll never end up catching up for inflation and whatever random expense gets thrown your way.  Fuck this rat race."

I like upscale apartment REITs because people who have money can afford to pay their rent. My two personal picks are AVB and UDR, both are retracing to pre pandemic levels, have solid management and pay a reasonable dividend, so you're getting that along with the long term upside."

2021-06-14 06:44:20,wallstreetbets,"In times of inflation, debt is your friend. Let other peoples money loose value while you hold a real asset, like gold or real estate.

In times of a deflationary crash with high unemployment, debt is your biggest enemy. Your mortgaged home will be foreclosed and sold for a shit price in a flooded market because everybody else is also bankrupt.

&#x200B;

Right now, both are plausible. The virus haltet trade and made the economy decline. The US and EU are trying to overplay the unemployment with benefits for those people and no mortgage foreclosures. So we could either see a 1923 Germany scenario, with high unemployment followed by hyper inflation because we were ""saved"" from unemployment with printed money, or we get inflation directly, without even seeing the deflationary shock the central banks and governments try to prevent before it even happens.

But in the bigger picture, any look at the M3 money supply in the US (Source: St Louis FRED) as well as the Gold price at $1900 instead of the fixed $35 in 1970 will tell you one thing: MONEY PRINTER GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.

So prepare accordingly. Real estate, gold and silver, ammo, canned food. Anything real and useful will eventually have a longer lifetime than cash."

It should be actually a good thing to have debts in case of inflation. Inflation also tends to make the price of houses increase. So I'd say it's a good time to get a loan to buy a house. Inflation will increase the value of your house and decrease the value of your debt at the same time. I'm not sure it works in the US house market (I don't know this market), but in France I'm quite sure it will work.

Crash is another thing... if you loose your job because of it, it changes everything. In such case, yeah, you're better without debts."

2021-06-13 20:51:33,wallstreetbets,Follow my no-tits-up logic here: you take out $400k in mortgage debt. Inflation moons faster than GME circa March 2021. Your debt is now worth less than it was when you took it out. Profit.
2021-06-13 22:11:52,wallstreetbets,"No it's not. You're losing out on opportunity cost if you don't need the money during a crash. 

Let's say you have a 3% loan on 100k and 100k in the bank. You can pay it off and not lose 3% year over year. If the market crashes, say 30% and you put 100k in you're up by a lot when it recovers (a few years most likely. Almost certainly under 10)."

2021-06-14 13:11:27,wallstreetbets,"I’m too lazy to manage them. I do enjoy hunting on my farms and the returns are steady. Hunting land is so popular right now. If your in the right places for ducks/deer you can rent it out by the season for stupid money. Wine has been good even during the pandemic. I was worried when it hit. Your big markets are China. My 700 or so bottles are stored on London England and I don’t handle any of the shipping or selling. I was worried about them tanking but Over the last 5 years, the returns have been steady. Wine is coming considered a wasting asset therefore it is exempt from taxes when you sell. That was a big reason I invested in wine. Muscle cars have been so hot for 10-15 years I just shake my head. Old school all original muscle cars are like diamonds. I wish I would have built a warehouse and bought 15-20 old cars and kept mind vs flipping them."
2021-06-14 08:28:20,wallstreetbets,"I'm just going with the OP's logic here. :P If we get 20% inflation, that's still significant in terms of fixed-rate loan repayment."
2021-06-14 08:27:44,wallstreetbets,"Typically, cost-of-living adjustments catch up to inflation eventually. :) The first year or two sucks something awful, but then it gets better. I wasn't around during the stagflation era in the 70s, but the fact is that people's salaries, wages, etc also went higher as the prices did."

2021-06-14 08:26:20,wallstreetbets,"Not quite. :) With this logic, you should never get an adjustable-rate loan, and should always pay them off first whenever possible. Also with this logic, paying off fixed-interest loans is the last thing you want to do if inflation explodes."
2021-06-14 15:14:52,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I totally agree with you. I'm extremely skeptical of the OP's claims (if only because the Fed has way better technology now than in the 70s), and I'm pretty sure things will work out just fine."

2021-06-14 00:24:42,wallstreetbets,hes saying you should refinance your house....
2021-06-14 03:05:28,wallstreetbets,Simple example. Say two guys each buy a house for $100k. One guy uses $50k loan $50k equity. Other guy uses $100k equity. Let’s say house prices appreciate by 20% in 5 years. First guy sells and makes 40% return on equity less 3% yr on loan (interest only). So $20k less $7500 = $12500. 25% ROE. Second guy makes 20% ROE. This doesn’t take into account transaction costs but you get the picture.

While a lot of things did take a hit those two stocks were not talked about but do your dd on those two and that’s a perfect example of market crash depends on what you got your money in.

Hyper inflation happens.   
Your 2023$ is now worth half as much as 2021$.   
Your debt it still 200k$.  
You pay the same 200k debt with 2023$.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

So, S&P is flat or goes up, UVXY goes down, if S&P is volatile and goes down UVXY goes up a lot. Last March, before the dip, it was trading at 10 bucks and volatility was low, options were cheap as chips. It spiked to $125 a few weeks later. An option contract that cost $40 was now worth $14k.

2021-06-14 16:44:10,wallstreetbets,"I'm not an expert on REITs (and what you're saying makes sense on it's face, purely from a yield perspective).  Yes you can protect your cash against inflation by putting it in a high yielding REIT, essentially outpacing inflation.

The risk that I'm highlighting is that if inflation gets out of hand and rates go up quickly, this has a large negative impact on the REIT business model (because higher rates increases their cost of capital and they're HIGHLY leveraged).  The impact of this can be severe (if this happens fast some of the most highly leveraged REITs could go tits up) but at the very least, even the least leveraged REITs will have to cut the dividend, which in turn lowers the value (i.e. share price).  

I'm not saying REITs are inherently a bad move, just that you should consider leverage and rate sensitivity, that's all."

Timing the market is obviously next to impossible, but I've found experienced investors to often have a sense for building up cash reserves. When there's a correction and the market downtrends, which is often when you find more attractive targets, you use part of that cash which will obviously lower the amount you keep."

Like how you might normally earn some money in a savings account if the interest rate is positive, you pay some money if it's negative. This incentivizes (in theory) more spending, lending, etc. rather than hoarding, and hopefully stimulates enough activity in the economy that they can raise rates without bringing it to its knees again."
2021-06-14 01:41:02,wallstreetbets,"This is the smart and rational economic thing to do. In fact it could lead to points of paying negative real interest rates on your mortgages/loans for the very reason you mentioned- you are paying back the same nominal loan at a fixed interest rate with arbitrarily less (real) valued dollars. Credit cards though are based on prime+, so they can change that as it's a variable rate. Unless it's a 0% interest card you should pay it off."

Was out of town last week so missed putting together an update there; this is a short one.

##Has Covid Pulled Forward our General Desensitization?

In the past months we’ve had some rather abnormal revelations (seems a strong word…): from ramped-up UFO discussion in anticipation of a forthcoming Pentagon report to cyber attacks on a pipeline and meet supplier to a shift in perception regarding the Wuhan Lab Leak theory… yet public reaction has seemed… apathetic.   

A recent episode of Josh Brown’s compound show touched on this (at least the cyber attacks). Sure, there has been some general shock and media attention, but maybe not as much as should be warranted? Has it just been too much lately without enough time to process? Or are we as a society just generally over it now? 

Perhaps the Have we just become so desensitized to ridiculousness over the last year (arguably 5 years…) that nothing is really that shocking anymore? Or maybe none of this has really affected our daily lives in a meaningful way (yet) and so we’ve quickly moved on to process the more pressing things at hand.

##Inflation

Bond markets, despite media furor earlier this year suggesting the concurrent jump in yields was due to inflation, have yet to price in any expectations of it long-term. While inflation data has come in hot the last two months, a composed review suggests it’s not all doom and gloom, at least for now. Following our latest surprise in CPI data (and leading up to it), US10Y yields dropped, possibly a further unwinding of shorts built up during the runup earlier this year but certainly suggesting bonds aren’t paying much attention to this data at the moment.

Who are we to believe? The bond market? The data? The Fed? None? Perhaps the noisiness in the data e.g. base effects, supply chain woes, requires more time for things to recover before we can make any conclusions.By then it may be too late, but why spoil the good time now?

[Sector Compare, YTD](https://imgur.com/qBhhTue)  


Sector-wise, financials have been lagging recently while tech and more specifically unprofitable growth stocks have ticked up recently. As we discussed earlier, bond yields have been giving ground again and this could be a correlated move.

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/vLj7V82)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/7lB7RC7)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/iwbN8Ny)

- SPY has managed to break above (barely) it’s recent range; with the recent stability in the face of surprising data and no real catalysts until August / Q3, conditions seem good for a melt-up in the short term.
- QQQ has broken above the 336 mark that I previously felt was upside resistance and a constraint on any buying; like the SPY I think conidiations are generally conducive to a melt-up in the short term.
- IWM touched the top end of its range, but failed to push through to new highs. This may pick back up, but given IWM has led this recent rally to the top end of our ranges it could be a warning sign that this is a short-lived bull run.
- Overall I think indicators are generally bullish, and without a real catalyst until August/Q3 data at least, it’s hard not to be bullish and expect something of a melt-up. Still, I don’t expect much upside remaining and the danger of downside is growing; I’d be long but looking to pare down positions and/or hedge.

I noticed I uploaded an older version of base case of my DCF 2.0. I have updated it with the current one. Nothing has changed. Only year 2024 is now projecting net profit instead of net loss.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*EDIT NOTE\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Hello everyone, it’s me again, Ragnaros. My last DCF got a ton of feedback and I wanted to incorporate most of it in my next one. So here is my DCF 2.0, an improved version of my last DCF. Before I start posting my pictures of my DCF, I want to explain a few things.

First of all, I want to clear out that with lack of financial data and given it’s a growth company at its early stages, it was hard to do any kind of DCF; therefore, there were many educated and conservative assumptions made.

This time, I performed 3 different DCFs for three difference scenarios i.e., Bear, Base and Bull scenarios. For simplicity, the probability of each happening was assigned 25%/50%/25% respectively. Moreover, for each case above, I have also done a sensitivity analysis based of different weighted average cost of capital (WACC), terminal value and also expected future dilution of shares. More details on the sensitivities later.

***Note:*** I feel like I’ve been somewhat conservative with my assumptions compared to what another analysts/websites have been projecting for BNGO. Oh, and also, Nanonozzle revenue hasn’t been projected in this DCF. Adding that would only affect the share price positively.

So here we go….

I know I know. First thing everybody is gonna come and explode about the unachievable 65%-75% CAGR on “Saphyrs Installed” and “Gross Revenue.” Hear me out! Its not just me, below are some analysts/websites who believe the same.

***An analyst from Seeking Alpha:***

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4d8yijy374571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ecd8105a2c49a6c95950179356b19a6acdc7511

Look at his “Units” and “Total” CAGR for the next 5 years. For me, I’m projecting about 65%-75% for the next 10 years. Seems in line to him.

***Next is this:***

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/14p59sq474571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=b97b1b8976d930b9eeceb0e41693fda505b56325

Another analyst, who projected for the next 8 years. His CAGR for “Gross Profit” is ((586M/12M)\^(1/7))-1 = 75%. This analyst is expecting about 500M in net profit by 2028. In my base case, I’m expecting 300M net profit by 2028.

***ChartMill*** website predicts revenue to grow at an exploding rate of 90% CAGR for the 5 years (isn’t this insane?) and people were calling me crazy for 70% CAGR in my last DCF.

&#x200B;

And last piece to support my assumption is from ARK Invest’s Big Ideas for 2021 presentation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qurnlnc674571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=27fd5c2ef83644849fa13a1a6098ef557f4acc87

Well isn’t ARK is “to know all about genomics”? Well they say this market is expected to grow 82% CAGR for the next 5 years.

I hope these all pieces are enough to support my claim.

Next up, how am I differentiating between Bear/Base/Bull scenarios. Well basically the differentiating factor in all cases is the re-occuring revenue. As per the CEO in Q4 2020 earnings transcript (picture below), he expects every Saphyr to produce 60K – 150K every year. I also believe he is not including Saphyr 2.0 revenues in it. Well then it was easy for me to assign approx. 80K in Bear case, 110k to Base case and 140k to Bull case. Hence, my row in DCF called “Re-Occuring Revenue per Saphyr.”

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/79j1kxr774571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e93322e03fba92d74c25c9ee3df5a7bfbd8d656c

In my last DCF, I didn’t do a great job in assuming expenses, so I tried to be more specific in this one. The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) or the Gross Margin assumption is set to be more realistic. I have increased it about 2.5% CAGR. Only in Bull case, I think they would increase it by 3.5% CAGR. Operating expenses will be the biggest cost to Bionano for the next few years as they will be spending a lot for exponential growth. And also as per the CFO he said to expect about 20% - 40% OPEX for the next couple of years.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iky1plc874571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=b261e4fd64dba35078b8dc3945f5028b7739576b

Another thing I would like to bring your attention to is the market opportunity the CEO thinks when we sell/install 10k Saphyrs:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h3g4sq1974571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=b30379f782ab2eea754ed1b9ed4cd302d8b3fffd

When we hit the 10k Saphyrs “installed”, not “sold” mark, you can see the Consumables Revenue is about 1.8B and total revenue collected from Saphyrs sold (2021 – 2030) is about 1.2B. This all adds up to about 3B revenue which about right in between in what the CEO thinks; hence, my base case.

In my last DCF, I also didn’t include taxes. Although taxes are 23% in the state of California, not every company pays that amount. They report expenses to get tax credits and as per my research, they pay around 16%-20% taxes. For my DCF, I have assumed 19% taxes in all scenarios. Another thing I want to point out is if you read the analysis of the analyst in the SeekingAlpha link above, he used a tax rate of 16%. Overall, taxes don’t have a significant impact of DCF.

&#x200B;

***Now to the juicy part, the SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS:***

***1)  WACC:***

I chose WACC between 10% - 17% is to incorporate all cases that includes industry average, future inflation fears that is going on, Bionano’s cost of equity or debt increases etc etc.

***2)  Terminal Value:***

Well, this one has a significant impact on BNGO’s current price target because this assumption takes care of forever growth of BNGO. I do believe that even after 2030 the company will grow at a higher rate till 2050-2060. However, for this study, I chose 2%-4% because 2% is to keep up with average inflation rate and 4% is because average GDP growth rate is 3% - 4%. Therefore, it made sense to make a range out of it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m73asty974571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa0ae925722265531ebf86c079adf28a8ba951f4

I have done a sensitivity analysis for all dilution cases i.e.;

***1)  No dilution:***

This means the company will not dilute its share for the next 10 years or even more than that. I think this case is highly likely because company has enough cash to last for the next several years. I know they have already opened a contract for more offerings up to 350M, but I don’t think they will be doing it anytime soon. So I guess that will be done when price is 10+ or even 20+. As a result, about 17M – 30M extra shares will be added to current outstanding, which will not have a significant impact in share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2dja53ya74571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=11320269f0cc7581688806c993a09530b1bbf51b

***2)  25% dilution:***

This means the in the next several years, company will dilute 25% of its current outstanding shares i.e., 279M\*1.25 = 349M new outstanding shares. This means that about extra 80M shares will be added. This will equal to about 800M – 1.5B (assuming offering at share price $10 - $20) worth of offering. I believe this is unlikely because Bionano will most likely be net profit positive by 2024 and will be self-sufficient. The only case why I think BNGO will do this kind of offering is to acquire some other small business for growth purposes. Other than that, I don’t see them doing such a big offering.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qila36lb74571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7c75fcc4f87f082d7ed7e2627d6c9ac44097336

***3)  50% dilution:***

Similar to the point above, this would translate to an addition of about 130M shares which equals to about 1.3B – 2B (assuming offering at share price $10 - $20) worth of offering. This scenario is very unlikely to happen.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xbftkwec74571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbcaf7cc470a8546c3b782f5c9e7fe0b5d3478c7

&#x200B;

Without dilution, my average price comes to $17. With 25% dilution, my average price comes to $14. With 50% dilution, my average price comes to $12. This is all assuming that chances of all WACC and TV are equally likely to happen. With three different prices and assuming 40%/40%/20% for all dilution cases I finally come to a conclusion of a current price target of $15. Obviously, I’m not saying price should be exactly $15, but somewhere in the ballpark. I would say anything below $10 is a steal and a “buy”, and current price should be anywhere between $12 - $16. Furthermore, to support my price target, here are the analysts’ ratings from tip ranks below. My price target is close to their 12 month’s price target.

Or are you one of the NNDM Cathie followers who love a stock that's been in the market for over nine years with a completed product with zero revenue that made over 1.5 billion from stock dilutions from investors in less than a year. There are negatives, they could take longer to get their LDTs approved, could take longer to perfect their Saphyr 2.0 but why are you trying to say it's a junk company when it's actually growing when everything else on this sub is financially burning and everything is a legit pump and dump?

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Case: $CRSR vs $ASO Hello apes. As we plan for the coming week and $CRSR gains traction on Reddit, I wanted to share some thoughts on the stock and how it compares to another stock I'm very bullish on, $ASO. For more details on $ASO, check out the DD post I made a few days ago [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxtv1j/aso_ape_here_some_fast_fact_dd_for_you_all/)

First, I like both stocks. I actually think they are very similar in a lot of ways: Both IPO'd last fall and are currently sitting well above their opening prices. Both are showing excellent earnings, growth Y/Y, P/E, analyst ratings, and institutional ownership. Both are being shorted >20% and trading at similar volumes, with similar Days to Cover.

How are they different? Key points:

$CRSR is seeing more action on Reddit at the moment, which in and of itself can move markets regardless of any other metrics.

$ASO has higher institutional ownership than $CRSR (17% more). It is also important to note that one of the largest holders of $CRSR, EagleTree, is being required to liquidate shares, which may reduce institutional ownership in the coming months. 

EDIT: It appears that, although EagleTree has been liquidating, it is not a legal requirement for them to do so.

$ASO has higher earnings per share, at $5 vs $1.50 for $CRSR. $ASO has better P/E, at less than 10, while $CRSR is hovering around 20.

$ASO has been showing more steady growth over time, while $CRSR has spiked a few times and hovered in the low 30s for some time now. This is a more bullish pattern for $ASO for sure.

Both stocks look great overall and show potential for both long term growth and short term spikes if people go after them. I'm bullish on both. I'm investing in both. So what's my overall opinion on which is better and why?

$CRSR is likely to see some jumps in price if enough apes ape into it this week, so I think we will see $CRSR outperform $ASO in the short term. However, I like $ASO more in the long term, and I think $ASO is really just a better version of $CRSR that could perform even better if it got the same amount of attention online as $CRSR is beginning to. My biggest concern for $CRSR is the EagleTree selling suppressing the price until that is done being liquidated. Barring a short term ape price move, $CRSR simply has more resistance to overcome than $ASO.

Also, $ASO gained +4.20% on Friday. Just sayin.

Positions: I'll be getting shorter term calls for $CRSR when the market opens tomorrow, and I'm currently holding longer term calls thru October for $ASO.

This is not financial advice. I am ape."

2021-06-14 03:29:46,wallstreetbets,I am in both. CRSR is a long term play. Short term too much institutional selling as you pointed out. ASO is doing great as people shop for outside activity. What I don't understand is how people on this board overlook ASO's short interest. That coupled with great growth and low valuation should send it even higher.

Also I'm a gamer that builds PCs and believes in their quality product. Chip shortage causing high prices, lots of people are waiting to build. I expect to see this lost growth made up for in months/years to come.

ASO, I'm an outdoor enthusiast who hunts, fishes, camps, etc and Academy regularly gets my dollar over competitors for multiple reasons: great return policy, usually the best price, has sales where others like Cabelas/Scheels barely have sales that are worth anything... the Magellan line of apparel has held up to the abuse I put it through... they don't sell boats or ATVs, but they sell everything you need to have a fulfilling outdoor experience. They've still managed to beat earnings while having multiple supply chain issues during covid. 

I'm bullish on both, but I'm about 5x deeper into CRSR atm."

2021-06-13 21:11:15,wallstreetbets,">$ASO

Not quite.  They have strong Internet eCommerce sales and they're growing. There's no stores in my state, but I buy from them online.

From their June earnings report: ""Over the last two years, E-commerce sales have increased 300.0% during the first quarter."""
2021-06-13 21:43:39,wallstreetbets,"Not true, if gaming goes towards cloud computing (which it absolutely will) and a big ass computer is no longer needed, then half of their product offerings will be obsolete. Just saying the future for CRSRs growth is not as easy as you suggest."
2021-06-14 09:48:20,wallstreetbets,"If movies have taught me anything, it's that when apes come into contact with guns, we take over the world.

Best reason to buy, really."
2021-06-14 01:36:35,wallstreetbets,"I have some $ASO, but I just got it because it’s going to the moon. 🚀🚀🚀
 #ApeShouldOwnASO"
2021-06-13 23:32:06,wallstreetbets,With the action they’re getting they definitely will for a little while at least. My penis is fully inside $ASO but I will be at least putting the tip in CRSR
2021-06-14 08:11:07,wallstreetbets,Congratulations on the morning run up
2021-06-13 20:42:15,wallstreetbets,Schwab showing 20
2021-06-13 20:15:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I have seen reports that when AMD gets back on their feet it should be a boost to CRSR as well."
2021-06-14 00:25:11,wallstreetbets,Absolutely
2021-06-13 20:09:27,wallstreetbets,"I just thought it was interesting that they shared so many metrics. 2 companies who both IPOd last fall, show great earnings and growth, trade at similar volumes and are being shorted around 20% at the same time? Almost feels like I’m looking at the same stock in a lot of ways"
2021-06-13 21:49:52,wallstreetbets,"Someone commented on CRSR a couple weeks ago and had some information from Eagletree. Essentially he said the company has a huge sell wall around $33 to start liquidating it’s shares. Said it will be trading pretty flat for a while. OP, you vaguely mentioned this in your post but for some reason still think it’s going to run more than ASO in the short term? That makes no sense."
2021-06-14 03:28:14,wallstreetbets,It happens all the time. I remember when shorts pointed out Lisa Su selling AMD shares @ $10.
2021-06-13 22:03:10,wallstreetbets,$ASO will have its time
2021-06-13 21:11:26,wallstreetbets,Check the link I put in above. The massive earnings per share as well as potential for expansion in the long term for starters.
2021-06-13 21:25:22,wallstreetbets,"They don't \*have\* to liquidate... There's no legal obligation they need to sell to be under a certain amount. In my guess, they will liquidate small chunks as the price climbs and the business grows which is totally normal.

Past sales of EagleTree (copied from DD: https://www.reddit.com/r/CRSR/comments/nwg0rq/corsair\_gaming\_eagletree\_capital\_thesis/):

\- 6.5m shares at $17, on September 22nd, 2020  
  
\-1.1m shares at $17, on October 9th, 2020  
  
\-8.3m shares at $35, on January 26th, 2021  
  
\-5m shares at $31.87, on June 3rd, 2021"
2021-06-13 20:20:40,wallstreetbets,"Seems like they’re doing it gradually at least, so I don’t expect the stock to take a massive dump all at once. It is hindering growth though"
2021-06-13 22:05:07,wallstreetbets,Check my other $ASO DD too!
2021-06-13 22:33:34,wallstreetbets,Lol top ticker of the weekend bro. $ASO has been getting some postings too even but not as much
2021-06-14 00:20:56,wallstreetbets,No reason to expect earnings to slow down. It’s shown steady growth. I expect it to continue
2021-06-14 00:27:39,wallstreetbets,Possible but if shorts reverse positions could go 70$ or more. I bought in @ 20 something range and s.i was 35% then and the stock has just been steady climbing. Do not under estimate aso. People still going crazy over the outdoors after being locked inside for a year. This run could last much longer than a lot of people think
2021-06-13 22:04:20,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t pick these two because they’re competing (though they do sort of compete for people’s pastimes, that’s about as close as I can get). I chose to compare them because I thought they were both great stocks that shared a lot of similar metrics. ASO and CRSR both look amazing in similar ways."
2021-06-14 02:14:59,wallstreetbets,You and my wife's boyfriend.
2021-06-14 02:20:38,wallstreetbets,My virgin ass is ready.

2021-06-13 21:42:13,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough! But did they have huge e-commerce before that? If not, it's pretty easy to go up from low numbers, especially during a pandemic. Gme was like 1k% or something lol"
2021-06-13 21:54:11,wallstreetbets,"They offer a lot more than just consoles/computer chips actually. Everything from gaming chairs to live stream setups and green screens. And they’re constantly acquiring other companies to expand their portfolio. I think they’ll be able to make the pivot effectively, but that shouldn’t even be a huge concern for the next 4 years or so. PS5 and Series X still came out fairly recently, people will be going hard on the latest stuff for a while longer."
2021-06-13 22:45:48,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it sort of will...but you need computers for serious gamers, or anything beyond casual. The delay for remote machines is pretty substantial and won't be negligible for decades. Studies show even a small fps boost above 60 makes a huge difference, and at that point we are talking about tiny fractions of a second delay in visual input"

2021-06-13 22:02:28,wallstreetbets,"There seems to be a lot of misinformation about EagleTree. I’ve edited my post based on commentary here. If anyone has firm sources regarding this situation that would be good to see though.
I do see $CRSR as more bullish than $ASO in the short term primarily because it’s getting a shitload of attention here this weekend and I think the volume will force it to spike this week."
2021-06-13 21:28:26,wallstreetbets,Then please ask OP to edit his post. I was just discussing about a potential entry point.
2021-06-13 20:24:24,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the f/u. That is a positive sign but it also depends on who is scooping up the shares. If it is only retail then that could mean more volatility. If another MM steps in to fill the void and hold then it should stabilize the pt. Please correct me if i am wrong.
2021-06-13 22:17:53,wallstreetbets,I have a sub $25 position in ASO. my DD is the stellar revenue and glowing google patron reviews. This indicates ASO is going to run for a while and remain a serious competitor to Dicks
2021-06-14 00:24:32,wallstreetbets,No reason to expect blow out earnings to continue either. But good luck!
2021-06-14 00:32:48,wallstreetbets,You are right. I live in the south and Academy is a staple. I shop there everywhere week. I just think there is not much room for movement in the short term and I do not expect it to continue outperforming. 150 @ $23.

2021-06-13 20:00:15,wallstreetbets,To each their own. I guess I just don’t feel excited enough about the stock to lock up that much capital in shares right now. I’ll put some up for a few premiums on leaps just to see but I’m heavier on $ASO for sure.
2021-06-14 00:58:38,wallstreetbets,Try their web site. They do a good job. I like most of their products.  I think they'll do well in the e-commerce arena.
2021-06-13 21:58:28,wallstreetbets,So sounds like they have to do a lot more than do nothing but increase it’s simply line capabilities. I’m invested in CRSR btw just saying it’s a much more long term play. Idk if there are any catalyst coming that will make it pop short term. Definitely hoping they find a way to become the “Nike” of esports.
2021-06-13 22:16:50,wallstreetbets,Thank you kind sir. I like the stonks putting my penis in both $ASO and $CRSR

2021-06-13 22:00:01,wallstreetbets,For sure. I would personally only be in LEAPS or short term calls in case Reddit pops it off this week.
2021-06-13 21:16:55,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, the CEO’s shares weren’t that dramatic 70k out of the 2.9m he owns, but the COO liquidated half of his holdings. I usually see execs liquidating toward the end of the year for tax coverage. Could be totally out in left field, but seems sus to me."
2021-06-13 20:01:44,wallstreetbets,"This is true. Still, it is cause to expect some resistance over the course of 2021."
2021-06-13 21:38:34,wallstreetbets,Agreed! I'll keep selling ccs on it for that reason after this week. .5-1% a week pretty consistently for months now

2021-06-13 20:14:50,wallstreetbets,This stock has the potential to drop down to low 2s territory. It’s really a coin flip. These penny stocks are very risky. I wouldn’t put all of my profits on a coin flip that’s for sure. There is no guarantee the stock will go up any further. I see it dropping below 3 bucks this week.

2021-06-13 22:56:45,wallstreetbets,If you are paying for living expenses with a loan than that is just being fucking dumb. You can work to pay for living expenses and food and then get a loan for school and stay instate. Paying the school for over priced food that they will also charge you another 5-8% interest on for the next 10-30 years is just being fucking dumb.
2021-06-14 17:45:22,wallstreetbets,Damn I need calls on that school.
2021-06-13 22:53:50,wallstreetbets,"If you are paying that much you are getting took or are going to make bank with connections....  or paying for a middle class life stye while living inside a box smaller than a prison cell.   my schools instate is still around 40K for the entire 4 years....looked it up about a month ago.. If you are out of state and are dumb enough to live on campus for the full 4 years it becomes 40K per year...

take one less class and see if you can get a job that is similar to the field you are going for to pay for living expenses.

if you get a job that pays take home ~$10 hour and only work 30 hours for 3 months is more than enough to pay for living expenses for the semester.. You move in with 4 other people to get rent down to say $500 a month that is 1500 for 3 months... Food is max $200-300 a month for an average cost of $2.22 or 3.33 per meal and you still have $1,000 left over for utilities, gas and spending money until the end of the semester."

I expect he thought Lily would come crawling to him in “gratitude” for saving her life. Fuck snape. He wasn’t ever a good guy, he just wanted to have the bone session he never got."
2021-06-14 04:26:38,wallstreetbets,"Snape put out the hit that got Harry's family murdered. His original plan was to make a widow out of Lily so he could swoop in, win the girl and indoctrinate her prodigal son into the dark arts.

But you know how the story goes. This absolute moron couldn't help himself when he saw Lily all defenseless. Imagine you're a hitman and you find your target parked outside a Wendy's. There's a crackhead sucking off a Bezos-looking baldie in a suit behind the dumpster. Voldemort would kill all three of them just for shits and giggles, just cause that *absolute* ***Neanderthal*** has no sense of control. 

You'd think an evil guy would help people get away with degenerate shit, right? Not Voldemort. He doesn't give a fuck about your evil plans cause he doesn't plan at all, he just kills. Fucking **evil idiots**, are they even truly evil?"

She decided that deep down, Snape was good pretty much as soon as she started writing the first book. In fact, she wrote the last chapter of the deathly hallows in like 1990."
2021-06-14 10:22:08,wallstreetbets,No I care about not defending nice guy behavior regardless of whether it is portrayed in real life or in fiction— because it’s fucking pathetic

2021-06-14 10:29:30,wallstreetbets,"Well you are doing this in response to a movie clip, I think you care just a little bit too much about what people think about Snape in Harry Potter. You can sympathize with his nice guy behavior, it’s part of his character. If we just saw Snape as inhuman it wouldn’t really make a good story. Do you not understand the concept of literature?"
2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My CLNE Valuation Model: $29 Price Target Since everyone is asking what CLNE PT is, I spent a bit of time this afternoon to pull together a quick Discounted Cash Flow Model with the following assumptions:

* 6/30/21 Revenue and EBIT figures are the average of consensus 12/31/21 and 12/31/22 estimates respectively
* There is a very distinct inflection point in revenue consensus estimate, with estimated 15% growth from 6/30/21 to 6/30/22 (from flat growth historically). These are ANALYST estimates, not my own. **This marks the beginning of paradigm shift to RNG energy which will propel growth to levels akin to booming software companies** which justifies my assumed growth
* As CLNE reaches scale through the RNG/clean energy paradigm shift, there will be significant EBIT expansion
* I've chosen an aggressive terminal EBITDA multiple. Before you spit your drink out, remember that comparable companies like FCEL are trading at **greater than 45x** ***REVENUE*** **multiples,** with ***negative*** EBITDA. So I feel that my assumption is actually fairly conservative

# Here are the results:

&#x200B;

[Discounted Cash Flow Model](https://preview.redd.it/nlcj0hips3571.png?width=1727&format=png&auto=webp&s=b07a08de5f8a583db079c9a9fcce4d8e545d2d07)

# As you can see, the model points to $28.85 share price, representing a 168% premium to the current market price

I continue to be bullish. **I will neither sell my calls nor my shares at any price less than $25.**

2021-06-14 00:11:09,wallstreetbets,"This is not a DCF, this is pricing. Terminal value is a huge input for a growth story, and you've turned it away from an intrinsic valuation into pricing using the multiple at the end.

But to stay with your assumptions, am I reading this correctly that you're assuming a Sales / Capital ratio (measure of reinvestment, meaning Change in Revenue / Reinvestment) of almost 4 in the beginning year, and effectively a Sales / Capital ratio of more than 13 in year 5? How is all this revenue growth achieved with no additional reinvestment? Are they progressively getting ridiculously efficient in reinvesting? The Natural Gas Distribution Sector has a Sales to Capital ratio of 0.54 for reference, and even granting unusually high efficiency it strikes me as too much.

I know jack shit about the company, but the insane reinvestment efficiency is fishy to me - and it frankly seems like you forgot to have the company reinvest more in line with its revenue growth. 

Using the exit multiple just outright turns it into pricing anyways."

2021-06-14 14:27:54,wallstreetbets,Agreed. A 50x multiple today would have the 5 year growth baked into it in my opinion. There shouldn't be such a big difference between the Gordon Growth perpetuity model and the exit EBITDA Multiple.

It was more to understand the assumptions behind the EBIT % of gross rev. For example it moves from 20% in 2024 to 30% in 2025."

2021-06-14 08:44:58,wallstreetbets,"Price just took a huge dip so the set-up for a rise very likely, coupled with sentiment and awareness (it is suddenly a Reddit stock now) and options expiring at the end of the week.

A major shareholder just took profit from selling a ton of shares, creating that huge dip - but with volume of buying coming from what I said above, there could easily be a 10-15% increase this week if not more. 

Most people here aren't happy unless they got from $10 to $1,000,000 in a day but realistically getting a quick 15% ROI is huge."

2021-06-13 20:02:56,wallstreetbets,"Actually, the Spanish inquisition was ""states rights"" driven.

You can extrapolate that to reddit however you like."

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Anyone Can Clearly See Workhorse Would Be a Great Addition to Tesla or GM &#x200B;

[UPS Testing Workhorse Surefly Drone. FAA Approval due in 6-12 months after 45\/45 succesful test flights](https://preview.redd.it/wqhoa8zkn3571.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea18cec433c1e6df28354cf013052b6ee5141811)

I have been long and extremly bullish on Workhorse Group since late last March. I have come to know the company well and stayed long (I did lose some shares playing margin like an idiot) even after its dramatic fall post USPS crash. This company is one of those the where the technlogy and holdings they have is worth far more than the paltry market cap of $2 Billion. Rivian, for example, is coming to market at an IPO of $70 Billion and when you compare the two companies head to head there really isn't that much difference besides a valuation of 35x more.

With Workhorse getting so much attention from retail investors now, I believe a merger may be in play before retail investors ""run up the score"" on a company that was wrongly targeted for bankruptcy by Wall Street hedge funds.General Motors in recent months announced a new commercial targeted EV company called Brightdrop. They are starting with a 600 cubic feet van and their first customer to sign on is Fed Ex. Workhorse Group has a 450 cf van, 650 cf van, and a 1000 cf van in their lineup. Adding to that is their patent for truck launched drone which is said to be possibily worth billions once cleared by the FAA which is roughly 6-12 months away according to company guidance. Both companies also own a stake in Lordstown Motors. Lordstown Motors (RIDE) is a spinoff of Workhorse Group and they kept a 10% stake along with commisions on the first 200,000 Endurances that sell. GM owns roughly 5% of the company after being a PIPE investor and basically giving them a fully equiped plant for pennies on the dollar. GM co-owns a new battery plant - along with LG - that will feed their EV supply line located right across the street from the old GM Plant (the third largest auto plant in the United States). You don't invest billions of dollars in the same area as an old plant if you don't have plans to make money on that property down the line going forward.

&#x200B;

[GM's Brightdrop Division FedEx EV Truck](https://preview.redd.it/1gv14kzrn3571.jpg?width=522&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a23fb669d6477fcf709cc03cf4d75fc4db22ad9)

If Elon Musk is as much of a maverick as I think he is though he could put a monkey wrench in the entire thing. If he were to buy out Workhorse (I believe they would be willing to part with the company for about $10 Billion which is about $65 a share) he would then have direct competitor to Brightdrop right out of the gate and a larger stake in Lordstown Motors than GM had going forward. They could also give LMC a lifeline in cash infusion (as GM may possibily do as well) to ramp up as they are currently cash stressed.

Now that Workhorse is again the center of the markets attention, and the cost of business will likely go up because of it, don't be suprised to start hearing some merger chatter like we did a few months back. It makes sense for both GM and Tesla to get them while they are cheap. Merger Monday is just a couple days away but buy your ticket regardless because if I am thinking it there is a good chance auto execs are as well."

It was a closed call Steve Schrader said the 950 would be delievered to EOY at the end of Feb or beginning of March to a fund and I had access to the call. You can see the pictures of them prepping a lot of the UPS trucks on their twitter page and they have also been spotted outside Union City and posted on social media from investors. UPS also featured our drone and van combo at CES with Verizon this winter. That partnership is strong and isn't going away."

Honestly wouldn't be suprised for the company to announce the first batch of delieveries to them this week with markets eyes on them. They are going to the depot in San Diego.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WWE Strange Institutional Ownership and Meaning Per Nasdaq, WWE's institutional ownership is 119.09% (much higher than other meme stocks).

However, per Wrestlenomics ([https://wrestlenomics.com/2020/09/23/who-owns-wwe-a-look-at-world-wrestling-entertainments-major-shareholders-2021/](https://wrestlenomics.com/2020/09/23/who-owns-wwe-a-look-at-world-wrestling-entertainments-major-shareholders-2021/)), Vince McMahon owns 38% of the shares. Stephanie McMahon owns 2.5% of the shares. Linda McMahon owns less than 1% of the shares. It is possible that \~41.5% of shares is distributed among some of the institutional holders listed above. However, this is unlikely to be the case. If none of the “McMahon shares” are counted among the institutional holders, the actual WWE institutional ownership might be a MIND-BOGGLING \~200%, after removing \~41.5% of the shares from the total share count.

What does 200% institutional ownership mean?

Assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings are reported as more than 100%. 

**With WWE, we potentially have a situation where 100% of the shares are owned by institutions and 100% of the shares are also shorted.**"

2021-06-14 01:51:52,wallstreetbets,His math has got your hook up
2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I shared my algo last week that tracks sentiment on wsb AND invests in those stocks. Although I rebalance monthly, I can check sentiment at any time - Here are the results for this week - 6/13 (and how to do it yourself!) Here's the [source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)! Note: this does need to be edited according to your needs (how many of the top you want to invest in, how you want to deploy it, etc.)

Your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list.

**How is sentiment calculated?**

This uses VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK ETFs, or even BB, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic.

&#x200B;

**Results and some stats:**

Right now I'm up 75% YTD, compared to the SP500's 15% (the spikes in GME and AMC have helped tremendously of course, and **I don't claim that this is a great strategy, just one that has been lucky due to 2021's craziness**)

\- The strategy is **backtested** only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an annualized return of 35% (compared to 16% for the SP500)

\- **Max drawdown of -8.7%** (aka how far it went down before coming back up -- interestingly enough, Reddit sentiment weathered COVID pretty well)

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Role of Shorts, a mixed analysis of high Short Interest stocks and Graham's ratios. HUYA, CLOV, GOEV, and much more. Hello, fellow apes,

I spent the last days trying to come up with a mixed analysis of the group of high short interest stocks while performing also a Graham NCAVPS.

For those that are not familiar with this ratio, it was developed by the big daddy of investing, the real OG, Mr. Benjamin Graham.

&#x200B;

[Picture for reference.](https://preview.redd.it/4p4os1fvx2571.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fa44f2e9e9658d59374908d65ce52977c249245)

Now, I know this is not r/stocks, so I won't bother you this too many complicated ratios and explanations.

So to keep it simple.

I decided to apply this famous ratio from Graham( NCAVPS) to the most shorted stocks right now.

As you can imagine none of them fall under what would be considered acceptable by Mr Graham, but, I wanted to see if there was any undervalued stock that actually was shorted for no reason.

Hedge funds(yes the evil guys) actually play sometimes a very important role in keeping the stock market in order, and when they short a company, this can be a good thing, basically removing cancerous companies from the market. The problem is that during the last year they got too greedy and decided to basically short every single thing in the market.

Well, this is not ok.

# Disclaimer: The only companies that passed the test are those with a positive result, therefore those companies that have Current Assets > Total Liabilities.

Plus, be aware that some companies might have very high current assets due to a fresh injection of cash, which needs to be interpreted and compared with the cash flow statement and the rest of the financial report.

&#x200B;

Here below my assumptions and changes to the NCAVPS formula.

I decided to use **total float instead of outstanding shares**, this factor might influence a lot the final results. I decided to go this way cause total float represents the most liquid group of shares, while the outstanding ones include also shares by insiders and so on, which are more rigid and very often less liquid than the float itself. (This is an adaptation of Graham's ratio which requires dividing the results of Current Assets - Total Liabilities by **outstanding shares).**

Many other formulas, like working capital and so on could be used, I personally like NCAVPS cause it has demonstrated that it gives very good results.

I will present today the top 5 and publish tomorrow the rest of the list if there is interest by the community. (CLOV is part of the list)

The results:

1. **$HUYA (The only company trading below its real value)**  *Technology Services*

This Chinese company is actually trading **under its real value.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[PRICE](https://preview.redd.it/mdlmhyy423571.png?width=81&format=png&auto=webp&s=113a733f1ddbc129b25dcb50ec3b1e50348f29a3)

This stock is trading 20 cents below its real price, this is actually a bargain, the stock is undervalued.

The logic is that by buying the stock at 16,04$ we are actually getting another 20 cents of assets basically for free.

Moreover, the company is trading extremely low, very close to the 52 weeks low.

&#x200B;

[High low](https://preview.redd.it/7hiqq8nh23571.png?width=161&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa244765745dbc3b97dcb14c52321bec9790ba04)

**Positive aspects:** The company is highly shorted, if the merger gets a greenlight there is the chance for a squeeze. Highly shorted stock close to the 52weeks low, with great upside potential.

**Negative factors for this stock,** which should always be taken into consideration are the Political risk which comes with Chinese companies, the recent developments in the Chinese internet sector and the standby merger

2. **SUPPORT.COM** **INC.  Has a MarketCap of 98.59 million. Therefore by community guidelines, I cannot talk about it. Do your own DD about it.**

&#x200B;

3. **$PUBM (Pubmatic was, in theory, the most shorted stock at the time this post was created)**

*Technology Services*

**Positive Aspects:** Very high short interest, the company had good results for Q1. The company seems to have solid-based and to be able to generate profit. Cash is stable and currents assets highly influenced by high Receivables.

Still close to 52 weeks low.

**Negative Aspects: The stock is trading 58% higher than the real value by NCAVPS rules, however for our case study, this not too relevant. Feel free to add other negative aspects about the company in the comments.**

&#x200B;

4. **$GOEV (Canoo) Another EV producer.**

Same story ad stocks above, not too overvalued considering the NCAVPS ratio and the high short interest combination.

I  am not a big fan of EV stocks (yes, insult me Tesla fans, it is fine), so make your on DD and develop your own opinion for the stock

&#x200B;

***DISCLAIMER: With this post, I just want to provide a different point of view regarding high shorted stocks, not all of them mean quick money. Behind a play against the hedge funds, there must be some fundamentals and reasons why we bet against them. I believe that stocks that are close to their real value(by NCAVPS standards), do provide a great opportunity. (Moreover, I did not acknowledge many other ratios and variables which are extremely important. My whole point was to just provide a simple mix analysis using NCAVPS)***

Regarding the EV stocks here above, is important to mention and understand their current assets might be inflated by recent cash injected into the company.

For all the companies, do your own DD.

As usual: This is not financial advice, just my interpretation, do your own DD, and so on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: I decided to apply this famous ratio from Graham( NCAVPS) to the most shorted stocks right now., top 5 options do not meet Graham's requirements but provide a clear image of the value of the stocks

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My current positions: HUYA 560 shares at 15.60$, BNGO 290 shares at 8.20$, CCL 800 shares at 28$

Previous positions: RKT, GME, AMC, CLOV, all liquidated.

Which of you fools think UPST will pump again after lockup expiration. Allow me to pop your cherry and encourage any of you to proof me wrong. 

1. 60% plus of their loans are approved and financed by 1 shady ass bank (Cross River Bank) which also finances most of the loans for shitty fintech companies like Affirm & CoinBase. 

2. 65% of their referrals also come form one company (Intuit - INTU) via their Credit Karma platform. At any point INTU can decide to go in to lending and destroy little UPST. 

3. 20% of UPST is owned by one hedge fund (Third Point) they invested in UPST back in 2005 and they also own a large chunk of Sentinel One which is going public in the next month.  So if you think they won’t sell think twice.  Also with 20% ownership and only 50% of the outstanding shares able to trade prior to lockup well now you know how they drive to price so high.  

4. Lastly it trades at 45X Sales in 2020 that shit was allowed in 2021 the market is gonna smell blood and decimate them."

And you cry 

Then she says ""just kidding. I could never love anyone as much as I love you."" 

Then you wake up. It was all a dream. Of course no one could ever love someone as stupid as you. 

Then you wake up again! It was a dream inside a dream. 

Inception. 

It's all real. You're a millionaire with a big booty hoe who loves you for you.

2021-06-13 22:31:27,wallstreetbets,"So $CRSR seems a lot of folks are saying a bunch of bots saying shit about it. Some probably are, I don’t know. 

However that has been around $WSB a long time. Jeremy at Financial Education is a big bull. So many people say that it is discounted and undervalued when comparing to peers. 

I personally have been looking at for a long time, but the options only went to Dec 21. When I noticed they opened 2023 calls on it 6/4, I did buy 1 2023 $30 LEAPS for $14.00. 

My only point is that not everything is a bot and a lot of people liked this before the traffic in here went nuts. It is a value play on a growth company in a sector that is red hot. That’s all."

2021-06-13 21:30:01,wallstreetbets,"To all CLNE folks here:
The news has been ripe that the largest shareholder in CLNE had shed 1.2 million shares. Which they see as a negative. Somehow these people forget to state that the company which did this: Total Energies, still holds 26.7% of CLNE. If some people see this as something negative but not as profit taking by selling a small stake. There is no need to comment further on such people. Given recent partnerships CLNE has had with Amazon, Chevron etc I am confident. Also CLNE produces Carbon Negative fuel RNG  which electric is not. The sale which is done by both the largest shareholder and the company is to increase the capacity of Carbon Negative fuel stations and research. 
Some people point to this being costly and I say so was Tesla too costly for many to purchase. Once CLNE completes this we will have a great future. Plus the current Biden administration is pro renewable energy and given CLNE is carbon negative the prospects are great."
2021-06-13 22:23:26,wallstreetbets,CLNE maybe +10-20% tomorrow?

2021-06-13 23:04:31,wallstreetbets,"Buy the rumor, sell the news

The essence is based on that markets often move in advance of an important news event or economic data release due to rumors and analytical projections about what the result will be. 

Traders and hedgies often take positions based on those sources of information, and they frequently talk to each other about what they or their favorite economist are expecting.

Others, however wait for the market to shift to discount — which means to price in upon formal release and then take a more confident position."

Perform sound fundamental market analysis before initiating a trade as it can make a significant difference in the overall success of a trading position using:

1- The economic calendar: it informs the trader on the scheduled time and date of the release of major and minor economic data that can have an effect on the markets (fyi this Tuesday retail report https://www.census.gov/retail/index.html)

2- Financial news media- it keeps the market informed of any major economic or geopolitical developments that could directly or indirectly affect the market.

3- Historical fundamental data- it can be useful to determine trends and how derivatives might react to a specific economic release after examining its behavior in the wake of a previous release or central bank rate decision, ie. In the past"

You lose 4 cents per share when the contracts are assigned and no possibility of increased value in the underlying stock, but the premium of a volition enough stock should be more than worth it.

Obviously the price could tank and you have unrealized losses there, but the hope is you get assigned quickly anyways.

2021-06-14 00:13:11,wallstreetbets,"This Week's Options Action Trades:

**ADBE** (Currently $541): SELL 555C 6/18 @ $4.6, BUY 540C 9/17 @ $28.35 (ER Calendar Spread to sell IV) 

Cost $23.75, really just an ATM September call for slightly cheaper. Trade loses if ADBE falls below $530 or rises above $604. Meh tier trade IMO, but will likely be profitable because of the rotation into large-cap tech.

**OKTA** (Currently $226): SELL 190P 8/20 @ $3.3, BUY 220P 8/20 @ $11.9 (Vertical spread with \~3:1 Max Payout)

Cost: $8.6, reasonable trade if you're bearish on mid-cap tech stocks. Trade loses if OKTA remains above $212. Great trade structure but I'm bullish on tech, especially cybersecurity, so this isn't a trade I'll be putting on."

2021-06-14 01:00:38,wallstreetbets,"I'm still big on Ford (F), Rivian (IPO by Sept- hopefully) and Hyliion (HYLN). Ford is a slow burner, but once it pops, I believe it will be a $30+ stock. It's currently $15-something but is still dirt cheap for mid-long term. Demand is sky high for vehicles right now and will continue through next year as well. 

Once Rivian has their IPO, likely early September, Ford will also benefit by billions. I'm adding Ford shares constantly as the price goes thru intermittent dips. Might be good to grab some options before the Rivian bump kicks in. 

Hyliion (HYLN) has an opportunity to revolutionize trucking and transportation. It's sitting at $12.32 currently but its 52-week high was up to $58. I can see it blowing past $100 by this time next year. May even be $500 in 2-3 years.

Good luck to everyone out there! Hold onto positions you feel are value-oriented.🦍💪

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,PLUG TA. It looks like PLUG finally broke out of its long downward channel and is now on the upside. It broke through the resistance at $29.61 and then managed to stay above it as a support. This looks bullish to me as it confirms the up trend. Thoughts? 
2021-06-13 21:44:32,wallstreetbets,Broke 30-31 which was resistance and seems to have flipped to support. Definitely need another week to confirm but I’d say it’s doing better than it has

What Is a Point-and-Figure (P&F) Chart you ask? (Thanks [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pointandfigurechart.asp)!)

A point-and-figure chart plots price movements for stocks, bonds, commodities, or [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp) without taking into consideration the passage of time.

Contrary to some other types of charts, like [candlesticks](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/candlestick-charting-what-is-it/), which mark the degree of an asset's movement over set time periods, P&F charts utilize columns consisting of stacked X's or O's, each of which represents a set amount of price movement. (1% in this chart) The X's illustrate rising prices, while O's represent a falling price.

Technical analysts still utilize concepts such as [support and resistance](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/), as well as other patterns, when viewing P&F charts. Some argue that support and resistance levels, as well as [breakouts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp), are more clearly defined on a P&F chart since it filters out tiny price movements and is less susceptible to [false breakouts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failedbreak.asp)."

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Lumen Technologies - Top 5 pick for 2021 LUMN - the old CenturyLink. Old tech and industry with declining fundamentals, and high short position - sound familiar? Yes, this one is a bit like GME and AMC. But unlike these two plays, LUMN has already made the difficult pivot by [buying Level 3 fiber assets a few years ago](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/10/31/centurylink-acquire-level-3-34-billion/93050098/).

Also, pays a nice dividend of 6.5%, and produces $2 billion of extra free cash flow above and beyond this Divvy. LUMN is buying back debt, and refinancing old expensive debt with much cheaper longer-dated debt. 

So what's holding LUMN back? The number 1 reason is the year-on-year decline in top-line revenue growth. With the COVID bounceback, I believe LUMN will start to see revenue start to increase YoY starting next Q.

Now is the time to buy before the negative sales trends shift. Let's make the short pay more than just the Dividend!"
2021-06-14 10:41:10,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't too happy when Level 3 got acquired as they were a solid company on their own, but that's life...

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PFIZER to the moon 🚀 With a forecast 2021 PE of roughly 11, great pharma assets & pipeline, and the continued need for Covid vaccines/boosters, I view Pfizer ($PFE) as undervalued just on current fundamentals. Not to mention there’s been a lot of deferred health care by people quarantining at home, so it’s reasonable for sales to pick up this year. 

And let’s not forget that you get paid a 4% dividend to wait for capital appreciation. PFE maintains that the dividend will not be reduced as a result of the initiation of a quarterly dividend by Viatris, Inc., which was spun out of Pfizer last year. 

Overall, PFE is in an industry that hasn’t experienced super high valuations lately. And the fundamentals, growth potential, and  dividend all help to provide a reasonable margin of safety. 

NOTE: This is not investment advice. Please do your own due diligence. As of the writing of this post, I hold a long position in Pfizer shares.

EDIT: Annual Covid booster shots could be a boon to Pfizer. Plus this new technique of using mRNA to speed up new vaccines and drugs could be a pipeline catalyst. Yeah, Pfizer hasn’t been a big mover historically. But with these fundamentals and the dividend you get paid to wait, I certainly wouldn’t want to be short this stock."

2021-06-14 01:11:22,wallstreetbets,10 cents a share per quarter

Data and facts my guy."
2021-06-13 22:38:29,wallstreetbets,I like data and facts. Which is why I like $WKHS And I like horses and tendies!
2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Technical observations for multiple stocks being discussed (SENS, CLF, WKHS, WISH, CLOV, TLRY, CLNE, WEN) There are many stocks being discussed right now and I thought I would share some of my observations of the trends of these stocks. Trends are obviously not always reliable, but they do give us some idea as to what is happening and what may happen in the near future. Timing is key to everything. This is not to say these are bad stocks. All stocks have ups and downs.  

This is not professional or financial advice. These are just my personal observations. 

#**Some technical terminology:**

**Bullish** = share prices rising

**Bearish** = share prices falling

**1. Exponential moving average (EMA)**

*What is what in the chart of share prices*:

* **Purple** line is EMA over past 20 blocks (EMA 20) - this shows a tighter trend since it averages over a shorter amount of time
* **Light blue** line is EMA over past 50 blocks (EMA 50)
* **Green line** is EMA over past 200 blocks (EMA 200) - this shows a more general trend since it averages over a longer amount of time

*Significance*:

* **Purple (EMA 20)** above **blue (EMA 50)** which is above **green (EMA 200)** = bullish
* stock crossing or bouncing off an EMA line in UPwards direction = bullish
* stock crossing or bouncing off an EMA line in DOWNwards direction = bearish
* EMA lines can be good references for support and resistance. 


**2. Trading volume**

These are the vertical bars lined up below the stock chart

* taller bar = higher trading volume (this is good for generating momentum)


**3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)**

This is the middle graph consisting below the main chart consisting of a blue squiggly line. It signifies price momentum. 

Basically:

* closer to the top bar = stock is more overbought
* closer to the bottom bar = stock is more oversold

**4. Moving average convergence divergence (MACD)**
This is the bottom most graph consisting of green bars, red bars, and 2 interweaving lines of blue and orange. This graph also signifies momentum. The two interweaving lines show the relationship between two moving averages of a share price

Basically:

* orange line ABOVE the blue line = bullish momentum
* orange line UNDER the blue line = bearish momentum


#**Now applying these concepts to the following stocks:**


#**SENS**
Increased 29.3% in past 5 days

Short Volume Ratio: 27%

[image](https://i.postimg.cc/85Rs2Tz3/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-22-29-AM.png)

1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in *bullish* order (purple over blue over green)
2. There is relatively *very high* trading volume
3. RSI is not above the top bar indicating oversold, which is great given the dramatic rise over the past several days
4. In the MACD, the orange line is above the blue line = **bullish**

I drew a horizontal line at around 4.2. This has been a point of resistance a couple times in the past few days but the broke above it Friday and seems to have converted it into a point of support. This appears bullish.

#**CLF** 
Increased 23.9% in past 5 days

Short Volume Ratio: 33%

[image](https://i.postimg.cc/ZYLCjYgv/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-23-54-AM.png)

1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in *bullish* order (purple over blue over green)
2. There is relatively high trading volume = good for momentum
3. There is momentum on the RSI towards selling but it is not above the top bar indicating being way oversold
4. In the MACD, the orange line is over the blue line (*bullish*)

I drew a horizontal golden line around 24.5 which was previously a point of resistance where the stock was rejected twice. On Friday, it looks like the stock had bullish momentum back to that line and may be able to consolidate and convert that line from resistance to support. 

#**Vinco ventures**
Increased 13.5% in past 5 days

Short Volume Ratio: 23%

[image](https://i.postimg.cc/zvq354Lf/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-23-18-AM.png)

1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in bullish order (purple over blue over green)
2. There is relatively high trading volume
3. RSI is in the middle meaning not oversold, which is good given the recent uptrend
4. In the MACD, the orange line is right on the blue line

I drew a horizontal golden line around 4.7 which has been a point of resistance x2, then support, then resistance. It appears the stock just broke above the line which is bullish.

#**CLNE**
Increased 4.0% in past 5 days

Short Volume Ratio: 24%

[image](https://i.postimg.cc/pLS980S0/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-24-48-AM.png)

1. It looks like the stock and purple EMA line (EMA 20) is crossing the green EMA line (EMA 200). This suggests bearish movement.
2. Trading volume is less than previously in the week, seems to be about its normal amount before the hype started.
3. RSI is closer to the lower bar, suggesting it may be somewhat undersold. 
4. In the MACD, the orange line and blue lines are overlapping, no upward or downward. 

I drew a horizontal line golden line around 11.1 which was initially a point of support and now appears to be a point of resistance. This is not convincingly bullish.

#**CLOV**
Increased 58.8% in past 5 days

Short Volume Ratio	24%

[image](https://i.postimg.cc/Gmt840X8/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-25-02-AM.png)

1. The stock and purple EMA line (20) are descending towards the green EMA line (EMA 200). This is hard to determine since it has not crossed, but does not suggest bullish movement. 
2. Trading volume is still relatively higher than normal
3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold
4. In the MACD, the orange line and blue lines are overlapping, hard to interpret. 

I drew a horizontal golden line around 16. This has been a line of support in the past few days, but now seems to be a point of resistance since the stock is now below it. This is not convincingly bullish.

#**TLRY**
Increased 4.27% in past 5 days

Short Volume Ratio: 29%

[image](https://i.postimg.cc/FzGzKGcV/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-25-17-AM.png)

1. The stock and purple EMA line (20) are descending towards the green EMA line (EMA 200). This does not suggest bullish movement. Hard to determine since it is not crossed.
2. Trading volume on Friday about the same as earlier in the week 
3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold
4. In the MACD, the orange line is slightly above the blue lines suggesting some upwards momentum.

It appears a critical point is around 19.8 (defined by the green EMA 200 line!). This was previously support the previous day but has become a point of resistance on Friday. If it can break past this upwards, that could suggest upwards movement. 

#**WKHS**
Increased 12.27% in past 5 days

Short volume: 22%

[image](https://i.postimg.cc/qRVzDN4y/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-25-22-AM.png)

1. The purple EMA 20 line is below the light blue EMA 50 line, which is somewhat unfavorable. However, both are still above the green EMA 200 line.
2. Trading volume is low
3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold
4. In the MACD, the orange line is slightly above the blue lines suggesting some upwards momentum.

It looks like there is currently support right at the purple EMA 20 line around 15.4. I drew a horizontal golden line at 16.2 which has been a point of resistance. If the stock can break above that, that would indicate bullish momentum to me. 

#**WEN**
Increased 5.09% in past 5 days

Short Volume Ratio: 14%

[image](https://i.postimg.cc/TPWKcVMT/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-25-30-AM.png)

1. The stock, the purple EMA 20 line, and the light blue EMA 50 line are all below the green EMA 200 line. Bearish.
2. Trading volume is low
3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold
4. In the MACD, the orange line is slightly above the blue lines suggesting some upwards momentum.

I drew a horizontal golden line at around 24.5. This is a point that the stock would need to break above.

#**WISH**
Increased 30.38% in past 5 days

Short Volume Ratio: 30%

[image](https://i.postimg.cc/mZ3FqycD/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-1-21-36-AM.png)

1. The stock and purple EMA line (20) are descending towards the green EMA line (EMA 200). This does not suggest bullish movement. 
2. trading volume is okay
3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold
4. In the MACD, the orange line and blue lines are overlapping, momentum can go up or down. 


tl:dr: SENS, CLF, look promising. WKHS, WISH, CLOV, TLRY, CLNE, WEN do not look quite as promising. Again, these only give us a sense of the momentum and are very very short term. Momentum can change in one day. Come Monday, momentums can change. Again, I am not a professional or financial advisor. These are my personal observations.



#**EDIT:** Added these per people's request
#**FUBO**

Increased 7.04% in past 5 days

Short Volume Ratio: 17%

[image](https://i.postimg.cc/XJFhb7mw/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-1-24-16-PM.png)

1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in *bullish* order (purple over blue over green)
2. There is relatively high trading volume
3. RSI is high, may come back down
4. In the MACD, the orange line is above the blue line = **bullish**

It looks like it broke through its point of resistance -- suggests bullish

#**UWMC**

Increased 15.35% in past 5 days

Short Volume Ratio: 31%

[image](https://i.postimg.cc/QNQPYCpD/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-1-24-41-PM.png)

1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in *bullish* order (purple over blue over green)
2. There is relatively high trading volume
3. RSI is in middle
4. In the MACD, the orange line is above the blue line = **bullish**

It looks like it broke through its point of resistance -- suggests bullish

*edited: EMA = exponential moving average and RSI directionality, thanks folks. Probably should have proofread better. 

Another comment: 
I know some don't think technicals apply to ""meme stocks"". However, I think they do still apply to ""meme stocks"" and give a better understanding of the current momentum and short term trends. I would not personally buy shares of a stock without considering its current momentum, past performance, and trends. We all know to ""buy the dip"", but these analyses can better inform us on what level of a dip would be a good buy. These analyses are how day traders decide their entry and exit points. I think a lot of traders would agree that technicals certainly apply to ""meme stocks"" and they use these to profit from the volatility and trade volume of these stocks. I agree that technical analysis is less applicable for the long term. Again, all stocks, even the best stocks, have their ups and downs. Again these are all very very short term predictions. Things can certainly change within a day. Come Monday, any of these can start to look more bullish or bearish. One thing you can do for your own confirmation is look back over the last few weeks of one of these stocks and look at the EMAs, RSI, and MACD and see how it correlates with the way the stock moves. Or you're welcome to look elsewhere on the internet because many people are doing technical analyses for these stocks. There are plenty on youtube. I'm certainly not a professional trader, but I like to be objective and I thought it would be nice to provide some objective data and analyses in this subreddit. A big reason GME was successful in January was because of the objective data and analyses put into it. I do love the hype and enthusiasm, but at the end of the day we should be making informed decisions for our money that are based on objective reasons--not just subjectively based on how many posts or comments mention a certain stock. Obviously feel free to disregard if you think technical analyses are irrelevant. And thanks for the corrections! Best of luck to all!"

That aside, here are some posts from apes who might have evolved to the next level or 10 beyond me. I don’t understand any of it so I can’t be sure. Maybe it’s all garbage. You might be smarter and understand more.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AVAH - Undervalued Company & Actual Squeeze Potential (~37% SI and 1.4M Float) Incoming DD -*TL;DR at the bottom*. 

**Aveanna Healthcare Holdings Inc. (AVAH)** is a leading, diversified home care platform focused on providing care to medically complex, high-cost patient populations. They directly address the most pressing challenges facing the U.S. healthcare system by providing safe, high-quality care in the home, the lower cost care setting preferred by patients. Their patient-centered care delivery platform is designed to improve the quality of care their patients receive, which allows the patients to remain in their homes and minimizes the overutilization of high-cost care settings such as hospitals. The clinical model is led by  caregivers, primarily skilled nurses, who provide specialized care to address the complex needs of each patient served across the full range of patient populations: newborns, children, adults and seniors. They have invested significantly in their platform to bring together best-in-class talent at all levels of the organization and support such talent with industry leading training, clinical programs, infrastructure and technology-enabled systems, which are increasingly essential in an evolving healthcare industry. They believe their platform creates sustainable competitive advantages that support their ability to continue driving rapid growth, both organically and through acquisitions, and positions them as the partner of choice for the patients we serve. [Prospectus here.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1832332/000119312521145016/d63831d424b4.htm) 

**The Boomer Thesis**

*IPO*  
AVAH IPO'd on April 29, 2021. They currently sit at a 2.2B market cap. Since then they reported Q1 2021 results, summarized in bullet points below:

* Revenue **increased 17.4%** from Q1 2020 
* Gross margin **increased 22.4%** from Q1 2020.
* Adjusted net income per diluted share **increased 300%** from Q1 2020.
* Adjusted EBITDA **increased 46.7%** from Q1 2020.

\*There are good reasons to use Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA metrics here. I'm not going to fully explain them; management has a good discussion in the [Q1 2021 results](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aveanna-healthcare-holdings-announces-first-201500451.html). 

*ESG*  
Given the importance of ESG investing over last few years and its predicted impact over the foreseeable future, what more do you want than a company who is providing health care services to the US population? Biden and the dems are the exact kind of government support you want for this kind of play. Even pre-Biden AVAH has been able to accelerate growth and capitalize on COVID-19 and the introduction of the CARES Act through (1) Provider Relief Funds, (2) State Sponsored Relief Funds, (3) Deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes, (3) Temporary reimbursement rate increases from various state Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care Programs, and (4) Medicare Advances.

*P/S Ratio of 1.45*  
Whats the knock on the company? They have a bunch of debt. Proceeds of the IPO were used to pay down a good chunk but they still have $1.2B of debt while only $67M cash on hand. Why shouldn't you care? Because their **revenue guidance for 2021 is ""at least $1.745B"".** They are trading at an insanely low **P/S ratio of 1.45!**  And as you can see above, gross margin is increasing significantly.

*Upgraded Credit Ratings*  
If you want even more boomer support, Moody's and S&P upgraded their credit ratings after AVAH paid down some of that debt.

*Insider Buying*  
There have been only 2 insider transactions after IPO - and guess what? The CEO and CFO bought more. Bullish.

BUT THE JUICIEST BIT IS BELOW:

**The YOLO Thesis**

AVAH is one of the highest shorted stocks in the market right now with \~37% SI according to Finviz:

https://preview.redd.it/q277xvxz02571.png?width=2466&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ba1f30197595d35b1dda9aa900caaab1f0f5443

I've been on these forums long enough to know that SI does not equal squeeze and there are a lot of other metrics that are involved. One of the main metrics is the share float - if there are a lot of shares available, prices are less volatile and less susceptible to a squeeze. But look at the screenshot above again - do you see the float? 

**There are only 1.48M in the float! I thought this was wrong until I looked at the prospectus:**

>In connection with this offering, our officers, directors and holders of approximately 99% of our outstanding common stock entered into lock-up agreements with the underwriters of this offering that, subject to certain exceptions, prohibit the signing party from selling, contracting to sell or otherwise disposing of any common stock or securities that are convertible or exchangeable for common stock or entering into any arrangement that transfers the economic consequences of ownership of our common stock for a period of up to 180 days from the date of this prospectus filed in connection with this offering.

What does this mean?

**YOU HAVE A 37% SHORTED STOCK WITH ONLY 1.48M SHARES FLOAT AND 99% OF THE OUTSTANDING CANNOT ENTER THE MARKET UNTIL OCTOBER 27, 2021!**

You want more? Look at the analyst coverage:

https://preview.redd.it/52pwr3mca2571.png?width=1686&format=png&auto=webp&s=93b53a67f51220ab125e9d8ffbc8b5651914d75e

Consensus Buy Ratings and Average Consensus Price Target of **$15.65 - representing \~23% upside on fundamentals alone.** 

**TL;DR**

* **Short interest of 37% and only 1.48M shares in the float. 99% of shares are locked up until October.**
* **Trading at P/S ratio of 1.45**
* **Upgraded credit ratings by Moodys and S&P**
* **Wall Street Price target 23% higher than current trading price.** 
* **Insider buying by the CEO and CFO**

2021-06-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Hostess Brands (TWNK): Follow-Up to my Long Thesis Posted in February ***TL;DR:*** ***Short interest has only increased to \~20%, 3-month average daily volume has only decreased to \~1.3mm shares per day (would take shorts 17 days to cover), and it's Pride Month (Twinks are gay men with boyish qualities) so we're social justice heroes if we buy (can't wait for the news to explain Twinkies). I believe the stock is structurally short because of Environmental, Social, Governance limitations by smart money, which only leaves a great buying opportunity for retail investors.***

My prior post from February 2021: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahib2/twinkies_for_tendies_long_thesis_on_hostess/)

What's up! In light of Pride Month and the recent posts on TWNK, I figured I would provide a quick update from my old post on the name. I continue to be excited, and long, holding common stock, warrants, and August call options.

**> Short Interest**: Has only **increased** from 15% in February to 20% Today

\> **Average Daily Volume**: Has only **decreased** from 1.4mm shares per day in February to 1.3mm shares per day Today (based on 3-month average volume). However, over the last 10 days average daily volume has spiked to 2.9mm shares.

**> Thoughts on Short Thesis:** I think the high short interest is driven by Environmental / Social / Governance issues, which are all the rage these days and every credible financial institution now has these limitations when investing. TWNK sells ""unhealthy foods"", which is probably what drives institutions to short the name, and also to *not buy* the name (thus the stock price could be artificially depressed). This may be a great opportunity for us, where these political factors, not fundamentals, are influencing the stock price. Given WSB is not bound by this, there may be upside here for us retail investors.

**> Thoughts on Meme-ability:** It's Pride Month, and a Twink, for those who don't know ""is usually considered a homosexual male with attractive, boyish qualities. Typically from the ages of 18-25, and often thought as a young, white, fashionable male."" Buying TWNK is also supporting Pride Month.

**> Thoughts on TWNK Moon Potential:** TWNK received  a little traction in the last week (search TWNK on Reddit), and the stock jumped as high as \~8% on Wednesday (June 9th). There is such little volume that a bit of traction on Reddit can really move the stock."

2021-06-14 09:22:36,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind Wendy's did have a data breach back in 2015/16 where the POS at a bunch of stores got infected and a bunch of credit card data got stolen.

Yes, an overall market downturn will hurt this company like any other, but if I was going to pick a boat survive the flood, it'd be UWMC over RKT or other lenders."

2021-06-13 23:47:10,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts on BB, it’s easier to bankrupt them through shorting and buy the tech off the repo market, then to buy their tech off them legit.  Hence why I think it spiked along with the rest during January.  It had some shorts hve to close positions I figure, but I also think that was their overall plan.  It used to be a 150$ stock when it did smartphones ONLY.  

Now if it gets into 70% of automobiles worldwide, and maybe they penetrate into other spaces…I know they have buses and public transit in Sweden, what if they expanded that OS a bit to work with autonomous machinery and forktrucks in shipping yards, the functionality would all be built into the code, and every container is already tagged in some way to locate it always, so it seems rudimentary.  But the point is the potential is so high."

Few one-off costs in there making the bottom line not look too flash, but they would expect to have these costs behind them and can exploit what should be a good operating margin and good market outlook (for them).

I'm sure prices will drop regardless of 23rd...just by how much I'm not sure. Still, that's what support is all about right? Might see some volume below current prices*

GE market cap 120b
PG&E 21b

Are any of these comparable though? If BB's adjusted earnings are 101m, a price of 14 puts their P/E at 77 (adjusted EPS 0.18). Most traditional companies are in the 10-40PE, with techs anywhere from 40-1000PE.

The catch of course is that these are ADJUSTED - you'll find the actual PE's are NaN because they're making a loss. But are these because of high one-off costs? And that's just trailing - what about future earnings/PE?"

2021-06-14 10:18:30,wallstreetbets,"A call is a contract to buy at a certain price.

If you buy a single call at $10, then you have the right to buy at that price for the duration of the call.  If the price goes up to $15, then you can buy at $10 using the call, then sell at market value, making a 5$ per share profit.

Calls are priced based on how in the money they are plus a premium based on, among other things, how volatile the stock currently is.

If the contract expires, you just lose your money."

Court settlements involve payment for damages. If Blackberry and Facebook are looking to reach a business agreement then OK. I agree. I think the $5 billion number is way too high.

2021-06-13 21:07:04,wallstreetbets,"The court didnt make a decision here. Both BB and FB told the court they would come to an agreement. So if the patent sale is indeed with FB, the business deal as you put it takes the place of a court decision or settlement on damages."

2021-06-13 21:39:43,wallstreetbets,"You can make investing returns on companies that aren’t profitable as long as the idea is compelling enough. I mean, Amazon took 14 years to churn out their first profitable quarter. The problem is, by the time they’re profitable you’re likely not buying at a discount anymore. 

I’m not saying BB will become the next Amazon but I think most people are trading it based on the 5+ year outlook - which as of today looks fantastic."
2021-06-13 20:07:05,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they didn’t care about certifications until they got hacked!! Department of commerce got hacked from using solarwind and Microsoft, so they switched to blackberry spark."
2021-06-13 21:46:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah it’s all speculation. Here’s hoping!
2021-06-13 22:08:50,wallstreetbets,"Amazon was deliberately but profitable. They had plenty of revenue, but were reinvesting every dollar back in to the company. That's VERY different than a lot of the other unprofitable companies out there that are just not hitting their growth targets."

2021-06-13 22:12:13,wallstreetbets,Okay do crowdstrike next.
2021-06-13 21:14:14,wallstreetbets,I agree. But the best of the bunch at the moment is blackberry. They also have quantum resistance encryption so should protect against quantum computer hacks. Latest news is China is leading in quantum race.

2021-06-14 10:36:42,wallstreetbets,"Merrill Edge did not allow me to use margin to buy AMC, MVIS, CLOV. Trading these securities needs cash. But I was able to use margin to buy WISH, QS oday.

Etrade also restricts margin for AMC."
2021-06-13 23:44:21,wallstreetbets,I did a variation of this. Decided where the market was headed and bought 0 dte puts or calls on spy. I betted 1/3 of my portfolio. I bought during local minimums or maximums during the day depending on put or call. Anytime there was a massive move I would check the news and see if I need to sell. Problem was I would guess wrong often and double down sometimes triple down ( this works usually to break even or small profit). I had some wild gains and losses but made over 500% in gains. I blew up my portfolio one day when the market dipped 5% one day on no news but option expiration by tripling down on calls much to early. The market just kept dipping like it had no support. 150k loss.
2021-06-13 23:18:50,wallstreetbets,You and I are but one trader of the same cloth

2021-06-14 07:54:50,wallstreetbets,Underpaid? Damn if that doesn't scream Amazon lol. I think the data that Rite Aid staff is paid like that is all the Amazon takeover DD I need haha
2021-06-14 04:14:45,wallstreetbets,"Walmart is the #3 pharmacy  retailer, ahead of #4 Rite aid. Your discounting the role store based pharmacy plays. CVS gained exposure in partnering with Target. 

Amazon already has an online Rx service and is now getting into branded testing. They could turn the 500 wholefood stores into physical locations and that would make them the 10th largest pharmacy chain in the US."

It’s market cap is $6 billion, very undervalued… Wish app ranking #1 and #2 on Google Play and Apple App Store… More than 300 million customers… More than 10 million users place more than 2 million orders per day."

Not sure about the neighborhoods around you but I bet most of the people live within 15 miles of a dollar general or something like it.  People like cheap crap and lots of people buy it.  

It does have a few problems, lots of lawsuits.  It does recognize revenue in a very creative GAAP way that inflates it revenue.  My biggest concern is during a pandemic, it lost money on a large amount of sales.  I write that off as their target client was most affected by covid.  

But I do believe it has potential to grow and believe it's undervalued.  The original IPO price was 24 I believe, so someone at one time also thought the same.  

Positions:  I am long and own 6,000 shares."
2021-06-14 00:31:28,wallstreetbets,So most phones already come with Amazon and Ebay as default apps leaving Alibaba as an outsider. But the app store shows that these apps have only been downloaded 100+ million times with reviews ranging 1-3 million. Wish on the other hand has been downloaded 500+ million times with 12 million reviews. So there's really heavy involvement with the app despite it being some shitty knockoff.

Seriously considering making an entry soon but aren't you concerned that wish is essentially a platform for aliexpress dropshippers? Not much of a moat there.

Also, wish is basically a laughing stock on the internet with all the hilariously bad consumer experiences. 

They have potential for sure and are very undervalued but just wondering what your thoughts are."
2021-06-14 08:12:46,wallstreetbets,"This is one of the clearest signs of a very serious undervaluation. 

I think this is mostly because WISH is a new unproven stock. ETSY also got cut in half 3 months after its IPO before bouncing back. 

WISH is now 3 months after IPO. We're due for a bounce too I suppose."
2021-06-13 23:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Super agree with you. I am holding WISH long term since January. I believe this stock in 20 years could go up to $3000. I know it looks like a lot but with the hyper inflation that USA has, even Amazon will top over $30000 in 20 years no problem."

2021-06-13 22:52:12,wallstreetbets,I worked on this same concept with a team a few years ago. To improve accuracy you need to get the AI to consider the source of the sentiments.

So a Delta of .8000 means it's 80% likely that the stock price will close above that strike on the expiration date.

Also when a market maker (citadel) sells an option they usually need to stay ""Delta neutral"" which means they'd buy shares equal to the Delta.  Each option is a contract for 100 shares, so a Delta of .8000 means they'd typically have 80 shares to secure the contract.

SO, all that to say, when people get excited about options being in the money, it's because they think market makers need to buy all those shares, when in actuality they're probably already secured by tons of shares and likely can unload shares that secure higher strikes as they get less likely to go ITM.  It goes both ways."
2021-06-13 23:16:17,wallstreetbets,Keep a close eye on the 40c open interest. As mentioned above it's around 127k and has been dropping 10-20k per day (people closing them out for profit). If it drops by a very large amount I expect AMC to close below 40 on Friday. I have no idea what I'm talking about but I think it will close above 40 like the other guy.
2021-06-14 09:07:29,wallstreetbets,Yes but just at $60 alone 25k calls are going to be hedged.  Basically 2.5M.  At $59 20k.  And there's other strikes too.

This week will have plenty of chop—it’s unavoidable 

Watch PDD $118.5 or thereabouts. Think that may be the entry, but will depend on market action.

Possible shit-show in tues data release, follow-through weds, then jPow smooths it all out with promises of further printing.

Then dollar tanks.

Question is: is China tech entry just before or after the dollar starts its descent?

Just going with charts here when it looks like my targets touch a channel-bottom, but this week’s about to be interesting as fuck with the multi-witching on Friday and the amount of economic data coming out

It’s been taking longer & longer periods of consolidation (previous triangles just get larger & larger & have longer width) and it seems/looks like we’re nearing the end of this one before a leg up.

I don’t think that guys calls will be saved though 😅"

2021-06-13 23:42:27,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Jerome has stated that he wants to avoid a market shock like we had in 2013 when the fed was aggressive with tapering. It spooked the market.

I think he’s guiding us with a firm hand of what to expect. His current priority has been lowering unemployment numbers, and at the pace we’re on +seasonal jobs, by end of year those numbers will be looking fantastic. 

He’s continued to have / drop bear tid bits so the market doesn’t get overzealous & see a shock when the course changes... but I truly believe that he’s trying to let it out in bits so that we digest it fully.

As for TSLA, I like that they’re moving to a vision only system & hiring specific drivers to test auto pilot in cities around the world. Driverless auto pilot is being tested , and FSD 9 beta is dropping soon.

On the digital currencies front, that looks bullish as well seeing where we are on the halvening cycle. & Tesla has significant holdings there that if we’re seeing 100k end of year it’ll be a boost to the stock. Cybertruck is coming as well. 

I like the market outlook. There’s also another wave of Covid on the horizon that will be interesting."

2021-06-13 23:01:15,wallstreetbets,Maybe it’s because I’ve had a couple drinks but it really is a good playlist. Lol sorry I’ll leave the topic alone.
2021-06-13 23:56:30,wallstreetbets,"The main thing for me is that Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook & Berkshire make up the main holdings of the s&p 500 and they’ve been flat or stagnant for almost a year. Berkshire has taken off but they mainly own Apple stock & a lot of cash on hand so it’s a wash of where that could go if there’s a drop (above 300 before a drop imo) 

I really don’t think there will be a free fall and I feel that way because those stocks haven’t really melted up. Even Tesla which makes a portion of the index up has been stagnant & consolidating. I’d be hard pressed to see a scenario where if they stay flat rest of year or even barely go up we fall or fall hard. What do you think?"

2021-06-13 23:31:18,wallstreetbets,"its simple...they are margin called on all shares they gambled and lost on-shorts and puts- but if there are ""fake shares"" like I believe there are, that means when you buy a share in general and you buy it from an owner that has ""fake shares"" meaning shares that are not in real existence (and again I dont know how hedges do this but they do for the simple reason the amounts accounted for do not add up to actaul shares available if you read the AMC chart and compare it to the available shares in the float now) it has to be accounted for due to the fact that you OWN that currency ..and they have to cover all shares when Margin called, meaning actual shares and bullshit shares ..this happened in GME stock and Im sure it still is today which explains one of the reasons that stock has stayed above a $160 support level pretty much since it exploded except the 2 days after the last eanrings call a few months back. Do the math on it and look at the actual numbers traded in the volume in the AMC chart, then you tell me if those shares add up to the 80% we are said to own at this point...it doesnt , and eventually it will catch up. If Im wrong then you will or have seen AMC go back down to under $20 a share, which its not doing"

If you pay no commissions on your trades, I suggest your break up the purchases... so you don't put all your effort on a single day transaction. Maybe a purchase on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. If it drops... pull the trigger... if it goes up... wait a couple more days.

If you're too excited... make sure you ""flush your dolphin"" or ""polish your banana"".

Seriously, emotions are the biggest obstacle of any trader.

Here's something to help: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnR5BBNxzHs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnR5BBNxzHs)

That AMD video was released 5 days ago on youtube. It has almost 260K views....

By far the most popular video AMD ever published...

GAMING and ENTERTAINMENT in the most pure and adult sense of the word.

Again.... leave the excitement on the side.

2021-06-13 21:07:03,wallstreetbets,"Dilbert, my man!...

Wait until we cross $105... then you should consider better diversification of your portfolio.

Diamond hands :D"
2021-06-14 16:42:35,wallstreetbets,"Hey there,

Near term catalysts are:

\- Fidelity FX Super Resolution to be presented next week (June 22nd). Tons of people are hoping for a strong showing, as the technology can literally make people obtain from 30% to 200% better FPS from GPU products.

\- Q2 financials reporting to be released on the last week of July (specific date not announced yet). I'm expecting a beat here, as they raised their guidance during the Q1 results... and likely their execution is exceeding their own expectations.

\- 5700G and 5600G APUs to be released for sale in early August

\- Q3 results sometime in October 2021. Again, I expect a beat vs. their 50% sales increase guidance. Mostly as new products will begin ramping to deal with the Q4 holiday season (e.g. Valve handheld).

\- Before the end of the year, the Xilinx deal should be closing.

\- Sometime in early December, there should be news on the Samsung S22 (High-end Galaxy mobile line-up), which will bring AMD graphics and is expected to clean the floor on the mobile industry. This is VERY important... as if they have a great showing, many more mobile players may license AMD technology.

\- Mid-December, there should be more clarity on the release of Zen3 stacked Cache technology, which will provide an extra 15% performance average to FPS boost. Consumers are very excited with this technology, as the cache would go up drastically.

\- Before the X-mas holidays, Valve should be release their portable handheld device. It is expected to have AMD hardware (likely an APU) which should be more powerful than Nintendo's Switch and likely take the crown in the portable gaming arena.

\- Lastly, Zen4 and RDNA3 are planned for 2022. The leaks so far are just incredible, but there should be more info towards the end of 2021. Some leaks have already indicated that Zen4 will have 128 cores (256 threads). This is just ludicrous!!!... but AMD is used to increasing cores and leaving Intel in the dust. RDNA3 on the other hand is expected to have 2.8x performance vs. the 6900XT... which is a GIGANTIC LEAP in performance that is simply unheard of. Never has a new GPU architecture brought so much performance vs. a prior generation. This is mostly thanks to MCM design (multichip).

Keep in mind that neither of these products will be cheap... they are enthusiast or workstation products, but the push the boundaries of technology quite radically.

Hope that provides some color on the upcoming events, product launches and financial reporting. In any case, I plan on writing a new article in a couple of weeks, with updates."
2021-06-14 07:56:12,wallstreetbets,"Both sides (AMD & Xilinx shareholders) approved the deal. Essentially, the owners want it merged.

The question is if any regulator has any issue. The idea is that the company does not have any national security issues, nor anti-trust issues preventing it from merging.

The merger is expected to occur by December 2021."
2021-06-13 21:21:57,wallstreetbets,M hoping AMD should cross $130 in next 9 months.
2021-06-13 20:11:31,wallstreetbets,I rather build 3 pc’s with the same performance than buy pay 1700 for a ps5. Thats more retarded than this sub
2021-06-14 16:58:23,wallstreetbets,thanks! extremely helpful!! I will definitely try to get in asap
2021-06-13 21:28:32,wallstreetbets,"Sure. The fundamentals are there....

But make sure you keep your portfolio adequately diversified.

The amount of shares you have is considerable. Hitting $130 is roughly $215K more (if you own 4400 shares).

I suggest you slowly remove chips from the table once we cross 105.

Find other undervalued stocks when AMD exceeds its fair value. It's the smart man move.

You get me?... That's called risk management."
2021-06-13 20:25:07,wallstreetbets,"Dude, are you serious???.... You think I meant $1700 for a PS5 ???

I meant it for a 6800XT or a 6900XT. The high-end Big Navi chips.

PS5's aren't the ONLY AMD product being scalped.

GPU's is where the biggest scalping occurs... but you need to find them first.

PS5's are scalped in Latin America, Africa and the rest of the satellite markets that have limited volume... but it is nowhere close to the GPU game.

GPU's are scalped EVERYWHERE... including the USA, Germany, UK, etc.

You want to build PS5 performance?... Wait until August and get 5700G and 5600G. Those will be scalped too... but still, an awesome deal to avoid having to buy a discrete GPU while the chip shortage continues.

Frankly, your contribution to the sub is a just as smart as your comment about it.

Wanna make it less retarded???... stay away."
2021-06-13 22:14:06,wallstreetbets,"Yups, Most likely I will cash out my investment atleast... 
Diamond Hands ..."
2021-06-13 20:16:42,wallstreetbets,"You are correct, their portable low TDP designs have industry performance leadership. Their GPU are putting up a great fight. The 6900XT is still beating the 3090 in many world record benchmarks.

That is, at a  fraction of the price.

But once Navi 31 is out... Nvidia will need a miracle to keep up.

AMD sacrificed an entire GPU generation in the high-end product segment while getting their house in order on the CPU front. A couple of years ago, they didn't have as much credit and cash as they do today.

Now, they came back swinging HARD with Navi 21.

The supply constraints are true... but AMD is TSMC #2 customer (only second to Apple).

TSMC knows their ONLY competitor is INTEL... so they NEED AMD to succeed.

The concept is called ""symbiotic relationship"". They need each other to survive.

AMD will continue growing with the Xilinx acquisition and TSMC will continue taking them more seriously.

In any case, it is never BAD to be in a position where you sell everything you can produce.

They also signed a new agreement with Glo-Fo... so they aren't putting all their eggs in a single basket. But of course, TSMC has the top manufacturing process right now...."
2021-06-13 20:32:30,wallstreetbets,"I have been taking the opposite trade for about half a year now. Will gladly keep taking the opposite trade. I'm actually glad you aren't yoloing your life savings on this stock. And that you already made money. I was an AMD bull from 2016 to 2020. Bought at $9, sold at $80 in September 2020. But unfortunately, there is virtually no upsides anymore to the stock.

AMD is only marginally better than Intel at specific tasks and so they are unable to raise prices DESPITE a global supply shortage or they risk losing marketshare. As long as they cannot begin to challenge Nvidia in the most lucrative markets, it will never have Nvidia's P/E. The stock is the definition of priced in. 

And that is being generous. High likelihood developments in ARM, inhouse chips for datacenters, resurgence of Intel, will chew at AMD's marketshare, and that negative market share growth is highly probable. 

There will be one day where AMD will drop 10%. It's not if it's when. I wouldn't be holding that stock again."

2021-06-14 16:23:15,wallstreetbets,Wtf do you think that video is about bro?
2021-06-14 17:34:30,wallstreetbets,humpadumpa ?.... :D
2021-06-14 17:41:56,wallstreetbets,Hair. The video is literally about hair.
2021-06-14 18:12:00,wallstreetbets,"No, the video is about software simulation developed by AMD.

Specifically, simulating organic movement of a 3D modeled body dancing... including, yes, digitally simulated hair.

But you should see the bigger picture: ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCE.

By far the most watched video in less than a week...

So, NO, it's not about ""hair"". It's about ENTERTAINMENT and simulating reality."

2021-06-13 20:02:00,wallstreetbets,Below $10 at Friday end I lose 100%.  At $10.23 I break even.  At $11 I am at about 335% gain.
2021-06-14 00:20:20,wallstreetbets,I see . Thank you !
2021-06-13 21:14:01,wallstreetbets,Ahhh I understand now.
2021-06-14 00:45:58,wallstreetbets,"So it could potentially spike down to $1 on Thursday, and then rally back to $12 on Friday for the win?"
2021-06-14 01:44:50,wallstreetbets,"Great except most brokers will want 20% of the strike + the premium from the put in collateral cash.  So the effective net debit is $3.25 for the position you posted.  $200 in locked away cash to cover the put, and you have to pay for the call."
2021-06-14 01:50:23,wallstreetbets,"If it spikes down to $1 he could buy back the short end for cheap as well and leave the 10Cs to expiration, which at $12/share would then make a $200/call value rather than $100 each from the spread."

2021-06-13 20:31:38,wallstreetbets,I hope you excercised them
2021-06-14 11:47:14,wallstreetbets,"In theory buying on one side of an option contract is not always perfectly balanced.  Sometimes the “market maker” at the CBOE writes the contract against shares held or shares purchased (to remain delta neutral).  This “purchase” by the Market Maker can drive shares up by absorbing supply.  So if 100,000 call buyers are active in a trading day and only 10,000 put buyers in theory you have 9,000,000 shares “bought” (cut and dry example, it’s less than this at the end of the day but you get the idea for illustration)"

2021-06-14 06:56:51,wallstreetbets,"Sure.  I bought a $2 call for sndl that only had a week on it.  Long shot. $0.04 premium ($4) for the contract.  If sndl took off (didn't) and neared/exceeded $2 I could have likely sold the contract for more, but it didn't, so I just let the contract expire."
2021-06-13 22:54:25,wallstreetbets,"**Super long read warning**

**TL;DR version -** Stock options. Most brokerages should allow you to trade them.  The absolutely simplest explanation possible for then is that you're either betting ""stonks goes up"" or ""stonks goes down"" by a certain date (by a certain amount)

  
**Super long version -**  


The two types of options are known as ""puts"" and ""calls"". And depending on if you're buying or selling, you are either ""long"" or ""short"" (respectively)

  
**For puts**: If you BUY a put, you have the RIGHT, but not the OBLIGATION to sell 100 shares of the stock at a specific price by a specific date. 

For example, lets say stock ABC is currently trading at $100. For whatever reason, let's say i think that the stock will fall to $90 in one month. In order to protect my investment, i can purchase a put, to sell the stock at $99 in one month. 

To do this, i pay someone for this contract a price, called the premium. Let's say that, arbitrarily, when i'm purchasing my $99 put, the current premium for those puts is $0.50. The price you pay is that price for EACH share of the stock. So since a single put contract is worth 100 shares, you take $0.50 \* 100 and the premium you pay for this contract is $50.

Note that the premium will generally fluctuate based on some complex math that's no where near worth it to try to figure out. Suffice to say that its based on 1) How much time until the contract expires and 2) How much the stock has been moving recently, either up **or** down.

So, for $50, i have protected my 100 shares of ABC for the next month if they fall below $100 per share.

On the other side of the coin, the person who SOLD the put is now under contract to buy 100 shares of ABC for $99 each before the end of the contract. If the person who bought it decides to make good on this contract, that is known as ""exercising"" the option. Note that the person who bought CAN exercise it at any time (but most options don't get exercised until expiry)

So far in this scenario, we have two people. Person A who bought the put, and person B, who sold the put. Person A paid Person B $50 for the contract.

At this point, person B gets to keep that $50 no matter what happens.

Now lets look at the possible scenarios that can happen over the course of the next month.

**Scenario 1 - ABC experiences a run up above $100**

In this scenario, after one month, the put option to sell the shares for $99 that person A spent $50 for expires worthless. Person B walks away from the transaction with $50.

**Scenario 2 - ABC Trades sideways and stay at $100**

This is exactly the same as scenario 1. The $99 put expires worthless.

**Scenario 3 - ABC falls, and the stock dips below $99**

In this scenario, person A will exercise their contract and sell their 100 shares to person B for $99, no matter what the stock price falls to. It doesn't matter if its $98.99, or $0.01, person A gets to sell their 100 shares for $9,900 to person B.

It's worth noting that depending on the specific price of the current stock, you might not necessarily break even on this trade. This is because the buyer (person A) paid $50 for the contract. To figure out your break even, you have to take the strike price (the price you're selling the shares at) minus the premium paid. So in this example, you would take $99 - $0.50, or $98.50. This is the price that the stock must drop below before person A actually makes money (note, this doesnt account for the price you paid for the 100 shares, which can also come in to play for your overall gain/loss)

**Ok, so this explains Puts, and, for calls:**

A call is literally the opposite of a put in terms of the contract. The person who sells (writes) the call is under obligation to SELL 100 shares of the stock at the contract price, and the person who BUYS the contract can exercise it to buy those shares.

So with all that out of the way, a super quick summation:

**Bullish (you think the stock goes up):**

Sell a put below the current price - You are selling a contract to buy shares at a certain price that you think will expire worthless.

Buy a call - You are buying the right to buy shares at a certain price before expiry.

**Bearish (you think the stock goes down):**

Sell a call above the current price - You are selling a contract to sell your shares at a price you think it wont reach and you think the contract will expire.

Buy a put - You are buying the right to sell shares at a certain price before expiry.

**You wanna perform a WSB yolo:**

Buy the cheapest calls you can with all of your money and pray they go up before all your money evaporates.

&#x200B;

**Some final words:**

Note that people can, and do, make money simply buying and selling puts/calls. This is because of the fluctuating premium i mentioned earlier. If you also buy and sell one of each of the exact same option contract, you effectively cancel each other out. So for example, if the above person B wanted to, they could buy another contract exactly like the one they sold to get themselves OUT of the contract. Depending on the current prices for that specific contract, this could either result in a gain or loss.  


There are also FAR more complex strategies with buying multiple options, such as debit/credit spreads, iron condors, butterflies, etc."
2021-06-13 22:54:43,wallstreetbets,"Basically betting on movement of a stocks price by a certain date. Calls means stock goes up, puts means stock goes down. You can either buy or sell your options if they’re “in the money” and if your options are “out the money” then you forfeit your bet."

I'd recommend a computer over a cell phone, just makes things easier. Lastly, it's not a game...

Check out YouTube, investing websites, join a discord (or several), take some small chances while you're figuring things out (or paper trade). Go in expecting you'll likely lose money, so have an exit strategy so you don't lose everything."

2021-06-14 13:12:17,wallstreetbets,"What a stupid fucking reply.  Sometimes people grow apart/change.  This is the exact mentality that keeps people in loveless shitty marriages, or they have bandaid kids.

2021-06-14 14:00:04,wallstreetbets,"Staying in a loveless marriage is better than giving up. Till death do you part means till death.  Don’t go taking a vow of marriage unless you’re willing to stick with it even if things get and stay bad.

Your feelings don’t matter. What’s “meant to be” doesn’t matter. If you’re married then you’re married so be a man and make it work or muscle through the misery. 

You are not entitled to happiness."

It’s a lot easier to make a fake Gucci bag with fake Gucci logo. If it were purely a fashion / trendy thing, I think we’d actually see more copies and people would buy them. Plus with a case, all they’d have to copy is the camera appearance."
2021-06-14 18:51:23,wallstreetbets,"Literally nothing I said was religious. Or in relation to arranged marriages, like... did you even read my post? 

Apparently the literal wedding vows are “crazy.” I didn’t make up that “till death so us part” thing. That’s not just a sentence, that’s the definition of marriage. 

If believing in marriage vows makes me a nut then so be it."

2021-06-14 08:19:36,wallstreetbets,"It was a SPAC. I heard about UWMC when RKT shot off and this was one of their competitors. 
They appear fairly solid. Valuation seems hard to nail, but it has been shorted.

Did a quick Google search, fintel.io says short fee borrow rate is 31%…. (Is that the interest?)

2021-06-13 21:31:27,wallstreetbets,SOFI is a bargain. I’ve slowly been buying shares and calls just patiently waiting. I believe if CLOV continues to run SOFI may catch some profits from the despac crowd and put the despacs back in the spotlight. I’ve been half expecting some BS Hindenburg research to be released on SOFI like they did CLOV…

2021-06-14 02:07:15,wallstreetbets,This is just a false narrative being pushed by the gme/amc moon cult.   The reality is that CLOV is heavily shorted and still worth holding until they fold.  They didn’t cover in the last runup so holding is still the smart play

2021-06-13 20:48:17,wallstreetbets,Kinda got em there lol
2021-06-13 21:14:19,wallstreetbets,a company making 14m a year with a 2.1b market cap sure as fuck does.
2021-06-13 21:16:25,wallstreetbets,"For reference the last company I worked for made 18m a year, and it was run out of a office with 12 employees. Would I buy them at 2.1billion? naw, i dont think so."
2021-06-13 21:16:40,wallstreetbets,"Sorry I should have been more clear I guess.  That is 14 million in new contracts signed on top of already existing customers.  This list does not include the 1.5b$ contract signed with Amazon, contracts signed with ups or Estes trucking.  These are just the contracts signed in the last few months.  Their annual revenue was already $300m"
2021-06-13 21:18:24,wallstreetbets,ah well that makes more sense.
2021-06-13 21:20:19,wallstreetbets,"My apologies, missed that part in my write up.  I said it in my head, just didn’t put it to paper."
2021-06-13 21:10:23,wallstreetbets,"Well the stock price went relatively unaffected so your thesis there was proved wrong.  Why create more debt to throw your debt to income ratio into a hole?  They are very close to being profitable and when they do become profitable more investors will come on board.  That is all anyone wants to talk about when they see this company (not profitable).  Well it takes money to make money.  Infrastructure isn’t just going to be donated and considering they continue to build and hold right at that break even point, it is only a matter of time before profits come in.  This will happen once they have built enough fueling stations to support the grid across the US.  In my opinion it was smart of them to take advantage of the high volatility to create some capital to fund these venture and infrastructure build outs.  Again just my opinion."
2021-06-13 22:14:47,wallstreetbets,"Let me make it simple

Let us assume they expect an overall ROI of 10% on their expansion plans. However, they are able to get a secured debt loan or issue convertible bonds at 3% and 5% respectively. Do you still tap the equity markets over the debt market?

The answer is no. If the expected ROI will be higher than the interest on the loan. You go for the debt. As management has a fiduciary duty to shareholders to maximize value.

Their debt levels are relatively fine. The only thing I can imagine is they were routinely turned down for loans due to risk. If that is the case, then that begs an even greater question. Why?  


The banks have more cash than they know what to do with. Just look at how high the reverse repos are now."

2021-06-13 22:44:58,wallstreetbets,"UWMC might be FOMO driven now, but you can pretty much disregard anything their CEO says.  He missed both top and bottom lines last quarter and has been losing market share to RKT every quarter for who knows how long even in the wholesale market.  He’s nothing but a used car salesman given the gullible empty promises and endless possibilities.  UWMC talks about how their sales aren’t affected as by refinancing, but 75% of their wholesale revenue is from refinancing.  They only have 20% more revenue than RKT in wholesale, and because they aren’t as efficient, they make 20% less profit on that revenue.  That means last quarter they actually made the same amount of $ on the wholesale side.  UWMC doesn’t even have a direct to consumer side which is the majority of RKT’s business and has 2 to 3 times the margins of wholesale."

2021-06-13 20:49:26,wallstreetbets,"Amazing explanation of IV Crush! I saved it.

Could you explain what call spreads are though? I didn't get that"
2021-06-13 21:05:21,wallstreetbets,"Those are what we call vertical spreads. It’s a defined risk strategy in which you buy an option and sell another at a different price. In the example, I was talking about the 240/250 call credit spread. It’s a credit spread because you are selling a more expensive option than the one you are buying, resulting in getting paid instead of paying to assume the position. The 240 call is always worth more than the 250 call, right? In this case you’re  selling the 240 call and buying the 250 call. For this to be profitable, you want the stock to be below 240 plus the credit you receive. There’s a limit to how much money you can make on this, basically, in normal situations the 240 call can only be worth as much as $10 more than the 250 call. 

The thing is, the credit you were receiving for that spread just before the end of earnings for GME was really high, almost $6. The day after earnings the price dropped and dropped and you could have bought that spread back for like a dollar but it gets better. GME closed the week at 233, which is lower than 240. Meaning both options expired out of the money, worthless. So you kept the whole credit you got when you sold the spread. Worst case scenario, GME doesn’t go below 240, you could still buy back the spread but remember, due to IV crush the 240 and the 250 are cheaper so the price of the spread is lower too. At times, by selling instead of buying around earnings events you can make money even if you guess the direction incorrectly."

Which of you fools think UPST will pump again after lockup expiration. Allow me to pop your cherry and encourage any of you to proof me wrong. 

1. 60% plus of their loans are approved and financed by 1 shady ass bank (Cross River Bank) which also finances most of the loans for shitty fintech companies like Affirm & CoinBase. 

2. 65% of their referrals also come form one company (Intuit - INTU) via their Credit Karma platform. At any point INTU can decide to go in to lending and destroy little UPST. 

3. 20% of UPST is owned by one hedge fund (Third Point) they invested in UPST back in 2005 and they also own a large chunk of Sentinel One which is going public in the next month.  So if you think they won’t sell think twice.  Also with 20% ownership and only 50% of the outstanding shares able to trade prior to lockup well now you know how they drive to price so high.  

4. Lastly it trades at 45X Sales in 2020 that shit was allowed in 2021 the market is gonna smell blood and decimate them."

2021-06-14 18:32:18,wallstreetbets,"Bought 12 more today. The 50-70 drop already happened. I bought 8k in 3/19 calls in March. I’ve been playing the choppiness since. Had 60k in $100 calls for 5/21.
I think you’re a little to into the FUD. This company has just started to grow exponentially."
2021-06-14 08:06:31,wallstreetbets,I have 10k in shares and like the stock. But it’s like a race to Retard Bottom with the technical astrology here with the butt wedge patterns lmfao
2021-06-14 09:02:35,wallstreetbets,"I disagree with this, but would like to hear your opinion.

To me, that looks less like a falling wedge and more like two trending channels, one above the other. 

When the top channel broke it's support, your green line, it became the resistance of the new channel.

Regardless, it's pumping today so it works out."
2021-06-14 11:55:28,wallstreetbets,"well the wedge is composed of two channels - one broke down

the 2nd channel was actually a bear flag but we broke it up today

u are just looking at a different timeframe"

2021-06-14 08:34:24,wallstreetbets,No. There’s a US trial and it was funded by operation warp speed. Also extensive manufacturing and worldwide contracts in place. OCGN only had North America rights.

So your strategy is garbage. 

If ur gonna do that at least wait for the run up for the *real* big news like government contracts or emergency authorization"

2021-06-14 14:46:06,wallstreetbets,This looks promising... Taking a large position now.
2021-06-14 14:49:23,wallstreetbets,Paul Tudor Jones just said this morning that Inflation is not transitory and we will see a surge in commodity prices.  JP Morgan also stated that today.  He expects inflation.  This is very negative for a SaaS based goods model like Peloton.

I have a bunch of option exp 6/18 for 26 so it’ll probably pin it under 26 then run around August so I can cry about it to my wife’s bf

2021-06-14 16:35:31,wallstreetbets,"What a bust this fucker was, still holding"
2021-06-14 18:50:04,wallstreetbets,"I have invested in all three.

My **only** concern with CLOV is that Citadel has more calls than puts. Whereas with GME, SPCE, WKHS, AMC, etc... Citadel has more puts than calls.

At the same time though, **all of the** **13F/A's** **were filed on May 21st for GME, SPCE, WKHS, AMC, MVIS, and CLOV.** Things may have changed since then. We can't know. In any of them.

**It's impossible to know, since then, what was sold, what wasn't, and what has been added to, in each and every one of these stocks**. 

**Ultimately, we're all blind on this.**

So, looking at the company, it's fundamentals, it's growth play, the SI% data and its investor excitement, I too think people will wish they jumped on this when it was still affordable."
2021-06-13 22:48:24,wallstreetbets,"I have 500 calls 2 bucks ITM and looking to add another 150. Your math on the vaccines doesn’t hold water, but that’s fine your overall thesis works. If you’re interested look up the reported infection rate amongst the vaccinated, it’s about .00022%. Of course many vaccinated aren’t getting tested, post vaccination. The fact that this was a married couple and therefore I’m assuming  
They shared no common genetics, makes the whole thing somewhat suspicious in my opinion. Perhaps they were older, the efficacy can wane more in that population.  This isn’t going to hurt them at all, if anything it helps the industry, because it shows the protocols work. The CDC can continue to approve. The stocks has been sliding a bit, but consolidation is occurring, it wants to be in the high 40s low 50s soon, once we break above 34 look out for another handful of points on the climb. Already made a nice chunk of change this year on this one, and I’m not sure about the timing, but it’s good for at least one more for me—in the very near future. People keep talking debt, but they don’t get it. How much debt is not the question, the question is the cost of said debt. It’s not going to cost them so much because of the terms/times in which they acquired it. Debt can be, and will be paid off. When Wall Street knows that they are going to be doing business this summer for sure, it’s a go go go scenario for Norwegian."

The fitness industry is growing at an incredible rate, and I believe this tech is the future, so to my mind FRX/BODY doesn't even need a big slice of the market for this to become a double/triple-bagger within a year or less. Best part is, theyre aiming at a different market from PTON. Plenty of room."

I'm in."
2021-06-14 01:08:03,wallstreetbets,"Just be careful of the sponsor selling shares on top of valiant apes.  On January 19, you had 7.5MM shares offered at $35.  EagleTree sold in the IPO and then in January, so if this starts to get some juice, you have 56MM shares potentially sitting on top of you.  

Otherwise seems like a cool trade idea"
2021-06-14 09:29:32,wallstreetbets,But pandemic is nearing to end wont people prefer going out than playing in?

2021-06-13 21:51:29,wallstreetbets,"Yes they are and this was even addressed in the last earnings call. 

One of the questions during questions time was exactly on the estimates being on the lower side (still really positive but very conservative). The company answered that they are purposefully being very conservative due to the Covid market changes and also they are new. 

There was more info but overall all of their estimates are conservative and we can expect them to be beat easily."
2021-06-14 14:01:50,wallstreetbets,Well I got some during the dip before lunch.  The profit will outweigh the increase in option premiums.

2021-06-14 02:51:04,wallstreetbets,I remember this. I have like 70% of my portfolio in CRSR. I've been building PC's for 25 years and I got really excited when I found out they went public and even more excited to watch their strategic acquisitions and several new product launches that are selling like crazy. I really like the stock.
2021-06-14 09:08:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man, definitely glad I didn’t sell those CC’s, not that I would"
2021-06-14 10:17:51,wallstreetbets,"Ya my CCs are in pain today.  Wish i had taken the small loss and bought back more of them friday but ah well.  I make money when those get exercised friday, just not as much"

2021-06-14 18:02:21,wallstreetbets,"Today was certainly shitty.  I de-leveraged quite a bit, and will reassess at the end of the month.  Surprised it stayed in the $9’s today."
2021-06-14 18:50:51,wallstreetbets,"well, in my case, i'd already placed the bet before they said that.  not gonna argue. this isn't what i expected.  still think the whole preorder biz. alpha fire, and baja were overblown as i've done that kind of market 'research' myself, and the others under 'shit happens'  but the amount of cash they've burned through already was a nasty surprise however they want to spin it as 'vertical integration'.  that was putting a huge cart in front of the horse imo, at a time when the cash pile was a main asset and key to valuation and continued operation.  looks like the board may have agreed.

hope i make money but in light of the recent chaos, mainly hope i dont lose anything but time at the worst, so thanks for that.  good luck to you as well."

If it’s less than 1, probably it’s undervalued.

If it’s more than 1, probably overvalued, but you can still project their growth and find its average because it can still be undervalued if they have some assumptions of future earnings or FCF.

I prefer FCF though since it’s harder to be manipulated than earnings.

For multiple, for a fast-growing company, I use 20-25. If it’s a slow-growing company, I use 15. My margin of safety, I use around 10-12."

As for the formula try different things and see which makes you more comfortable. For example:
5 year average Operating income or net earnings whichever is lower multiplied by the average P/E of the company of the last 10-15 years should give you a fair price assuming the company is going to grow its earnings in the future. Anything below that is a buy because eventually the stock is suposed to come back to its average valuation so if they grow, that average valuation will mean a higher stock price than it is now"

If you take their average free cash flow per year and multiply by 10, and it's less than their market cap, then that company may be undervalued. But it could also be a dying company. 

Look at similar companies (relative valuation). Does the company have a sustainable competitive advantage for the future? (i.e. a moat)."

\-Any concerning or high-profile litigation that can affect the stock price? No is a +, yes is a -

The past performance isn't really relevant to your current decision. If you have a strong conviction that this particular stock is going to double again in the next year (or whatever), there are only two reasons to cash out now: either you need that money for a different investment (that you expect to perform even better than this one), or you are equally certain that the price is going to go back down again before it reaches that higher level and you think you can buy back in lower.

You aren’t forced to buy the shares if they’re OTM or ITM. If they are OTM at expiration then you do nothing as it’s worthless.  If they’re ITM and you don’t have enough funds to cover then your broker will either sell them and send you the difference or give you the shares and then must come up with the money or sell them ASAP.

If there are advisors suggesting to pull, then they're likely right, or they're doing their customers a disservice to save their own skin from owing customers. The markets been a fools errand since March last year when the market decided to magically recoup in less than a year; it took 6+ years for other crashes to recoup and exceed beyond their initial drop point.

Sure, you could argue technology creates exponential levels of recuperation within markets and economies, it can also create a exponential downfall. Where there is a Yin, there is a Yang.

Don't forget, most market rules in effect today are from when markets weren't digitized. You're lying to yourself otherwise, please research into the DTCC, SEC, FINRA, etc.

Inflation can be good or bad, looks like its on the cusp from going good for majority of investors and bad for the select few higher up, to bad for majority, and good for select higher up.

JPowell and his ""finance know it all's"" dumped loads of money into the American economy, with what is assumed nowhere near where the job markets % of employed should be, yet somehow the economy and general public is doing better than it was before march 2020?

Idk about you but when I step away from my screen and see twice as many people on the street due to house and business foreclosure (By the way, large funds are purchasing bankrupt houses by the hundreds of thousands, to be sold back to general public as rentals), that tells me something the publicized news doesn't want to say.

2021-06-14 17:25:21,stocks,"I would say that the 10%+ drop in the Nasdaq this time earlier this year was much more about other stocks besides the bellwethers of that July-August run from last year (which were Apple and Amazon).

Now don't get me wrong, profitable tech got it fairly good but in being specific and going from when the drop really began for the Nasdaq, just as one example:

TSLA: -31% (worse if you go from when it had the blow off top)

AMZN: -10%

That doesn't even get into small cap tech, which don't get me started there...(although I haven't touched any of them). When you think of a ""Growth Investor"" here, many are in those kinds of names and not an AMZN.

But the ""right now"" here is the index itself seems ready to exit a 4 month consolidation period unless a catalyst stops it. I honestly don't think it really ""fully"" happens until next month though."
2021-06-14 17:20:22,stocks,"The question I get asked the most is ""How do I use this to make money?"" The section ""How do I use this data?"" is what I do to make money off it. Basically, I use the pivot tables from the data to hone in on which criteria groupings are the most ""successful"" (have the highest percentage of profitable vs non-profitable). This tells me that anything that meets those categories is most likely to go green. There's always a little personal judgement on what constitutes a successful category.

&#x200B;

**So for instance, using the Millenial Bets tracker, the best categories are:**

* Total Posts: 1 - 13
* Total Score: 2 - 10, 12 - 14, 18 - 20
* Starting Price Range: $2 - $280
* SPAC: No  


  
Using that criteria I go through the data I download today and filter out anything that doesn't meet the above criteria. That gives me a list of potential stocks

  
I'll take that list and do some quick ""bullish or bearish"" searches on Reddit to try narrow it down to 3 - 5 tickers. From there I'll just spread my money out across them all.

  
When to sell? For each of the criteria above I have the average percent increase (my sell point) and the average number of days to get there (how long to hold). Some weeks I'll be looking at 18% in 3 days, other times I'll be looking at 5% in 6 days. It really depends on the markets that week. In the end, the data just points you to the categories that are most successful"
2021-06-14 16:58:08,stocks,"As a person who is pretty active in meme stock communities let me tell you, a lot of the stocks being promoted on Reddit are pump and dumps. If you go through the major holders of the stocks being promoted, you’ll see that they are funds that are short on this one stock in particular(not going to mention the name of that stock because I understand not every community wants to be involved with that stock). Basically what I’m trying to say is, most of the stocks being promoted on Reddit right now are pump and dumps with no fundamentals or technicals supporting a bullish trend."

2021-06-14 15:22:58,stocks,"From my understanding they “plan” to start production in September, but unless they have a huge influx of capital from an investor/investors they will not have the liquidity to clear the needed materials. This only came out because they were threatened with de-listing if they didn’t file a 10-K. I don’t own it, and don’t really watch it close - but it’s brought up in investor media pretty regularly.

Big Picture: I think many low to mid cap growth stocks in emerging sectors (EV, AI, Blockchain, Etc) rode a huge wave to crazy valuations thanks to low interest rates from about August to Feburary, and then crashed harder than FAANG when the market cycled into value. With money starting to cycle into growth again it feels like the market is being more particular and is betting on established names with market share and pricing power."
2021-06-14 16:18:04,stocks,"I dont think this stock is treated unfairly mainly due to the amount of uncertanty associated with it. Lordstown is under SEC investigation while failing to raise cash to start production all while everyday they don't have a product on the road, they burn through cash. This is just such an uncertain situation that I and many investors don't want to be   a part off. What I notice about the lordstown defense Is that every bit of information that defends them comes directly from them, it's just kind of obvious when a company is accused of fraud they defend themselves guilty or not so I don't think citing a law firm the company hired or the company themselves is very reliable. This is also not helped by the fact that tesla and Ford are both going to be heavy competition and if they don't clear all this under soon it won't matter if they're guilty or innocent they will be eaten out by the competition. Plain and simple the risk reward here is absolutely terrible, there is just so much that could go wrong you are taking a massive risk compared to the reward."

The funny thing to me is that the news outlets were creating a big deal of them being late with filing the 10-Q, but when they did and announced all the things that were already said in the conference call and earnings report, everyone lost their shit and said LMC is going bankrupt, when they absolutely had to word it that way because of SEC (going concern in the next 12 months without extra capital). They will still be fine until Q2 2022 without the extra money.

I do agree the 20-30$ valuation was a bit crazy at the start of the year, but I don't see how at this point in time, RIDE can be below 12-13$, and I'm trying to be objective and conservative even though I'm bullish on the stock long term.

All of the stuff bears and hates were pointing out in recent months were proven wrong, the only 2 remaining things were the money issues and CEO being hated and considered a scammer/fraud, now he's gone and if they get extra financing, what then? Does the sentiment change to positive, or will people find something else to bash the company with?"
2021-06-14 16:43:37,stocks,"Fair, thanks for adding to the discussion.

Can't disagree with anything you said, there of course is a lot of uncertainty here, but that's what happens when you're a startup, you've got to prove yourself and if you don't exceed expectations people will bash it, I get all of that, after all, I'm guessing there are just as many blatant haters and trolls as there are people mindlessly pumping the stock without considering the risks and the downsides.

That being said, I think the competition in the EV pickup truck market isn't that harsh that there wouldn't be space for more than the main 3-4 companies. After all, if LMC can start production on time and gets the capital to be able to scale it up, they will be first to market and if the truck is actually good, there will definitely be enough demand for them to sell everything they produce in the coming 2-3 years."

> “I think stocks are ridiculously cheap if you believe ... that 3% on the 30-year bonds makes sense,” Buffett said in an interview 

A month ago, at Berkshire's Annual investor meeting when asked about Apple and high tech valuations.

>""If present (interest) rates were destined to be appropriate, if the 10 year (yield) should really be at the price it is, those companies that the fellow mentioned in this question, they're a bargain. I mean, they have the ability to deliver cash at a rate that, if you discounted back and you're discounting at present interest rates, stocks are very, very cheap.""

He's clearly not comfortable with what's happened to interest rates.  Rates have been heading down for 30 years though."
2021-06-14 16:39:28,stocks,The world is way more globalised than it was a decade or two ago. Why would you compare market cap of fe FAANG to just US GDP? Apple gets more than 60% of its revenues from outside of the US.
2021-06-14 14:47:40,stocks,"this has been posted pretty much every week, if not every day

no one will know when a drop will happen. there will definitely be a drop in the future, could be next week, next year, next decade. but when it does happen, it just means buy the dip"
2021-06-14 19:07:38,stocks,"Noticing a lot of ""this time it's different"" comments. Which occur during a bull market peak. Thoughts?"
2021-06-14 14:55:00,stocks,"I think you should always be ready for one but there’s always people predicting the next big crash. Try balancing, not just growth stocks. I’ve been fearing a drop since I got into investing in late 2019. I might have made a lot more if I weren’t so cautious but I’ve done well nonetheless."
2021-06-14 16:52:16,stocks,"If a market is overvalued for several years, at what point does it just become fair value?

I think a lot of the old indicators aren’t as accurate anymore as it doesn’t take into account how easy it is now for new investors to put money into the market. Anyone with a smartphone can be buying stocks in 20 mins now whereas that was not as true 5 years ago"
2021-06-14 18:44:33,stocks,"It's not just the buffet indicator at 230% of GDP, it's also the shiller PE ratio at 38 (normally 15-20), real estate prices at over 30% from the peak of the 2006 bubble, government running massive deficits influenced by false modern monetary theory beliefs and debt to GDP ratio of 143%, M2 money supply increasing nearly 30% in 2020...

So you may ask, why is inflation at only 5%?
The velocity of M2 has went down to half what it was before the pandemic, the American people are saving money, 15% in April in personal savings, compared to a normal 6-8%.

2020 has had a record number of brokerage accounts being opened, there is a ton of money flowing around and it ends up in real estate and the stock market. There is a reason reverse-repo reached 500 billion, too much money supply.

Hey I am no expert, but this is unsustainable imo
If the US was a stock, I wouldn't buy it right now."
2021-06-14 17:20:29,stocks,"Yes, but by no means try to time it. Watch for the fed to increase rates, or what happens after June 30 when the mortgage default protection put in place as covid response ends. There are currently ~2.1M mortgages that are >90 days late."

2021-06-14 16:37:10,stocks,"I’ve been an investor for a long time. The one thing that’s always consistent is that when everyone is talking about something, when everyone thinks something is going to happen, it never does. 

Market rips and especially market drops cannot be seen from miles away. The fear and uncertainty of an unforeseen event happening is the only thing that can really move a market. Everything foreseeable gets priced in.

Inflation? Please. Burry announcing his short positions on TSLA practically guaranteed that trade wouldn’t work. 

Look at BTC in May, everyone was saying “skies the limit” then Musk and China change attitude unexpectedly and boom, 50% crash. Then, everyone’s saying, “we got another huge leg down, it’s bad for the environment and it’s going to 19k” and whoops, El Salvador adopted BTC as a currency, musk changed his mind and it turned out to not be bad for the environment and there was a 33% rally in a week.

It’s just food for thought, but again, IMO when everyone thinks they see a huge move happening, it practically never happens."
2021-06-14 15:58:12,stocks,Difficult part is that interest rates are so low and inflation is getting higher so you are losing a lot if you keep in cash for a long time.
2021-06-14 14:25:41,stocks,"Perhaps or perhaps not. Warren Buffet himself will tell you that if you want to invest, don’t wait for a favorable event to occur. Just get in. Time in the market > timing the market."
2021-06-14 18:10:43,stocks,The GDP its comparing the data to is from prior period. It's not up to date. With the economy slightly opening back up. I'd expect the BI to drop. GDP certainly is raising with people going back to work.
2021-06-14 17:40:23,stocks,"As a data analyst, a single metric is never sufficient for anything actionable. Need more intelligence from several other metrics for apples to apples comparison.

Making stock adjustments on a single metric is foolish, especially single metric correlations."
2021-06-14 17:07:46,stocks,"The Buffet indicator is just Warren Buffet dividing an index (the Wilshire 5k) by an economic value, GDP. While Warren Buffet is one of the most successful stock pickers ever, his ""indicator"" does not seem to be something he derived using actual science, and so it's fallacy to assume it's still an end-all-be-all market predictor."
2021-06-14 17:07:49,stocks,Usually 50-100%. You say it's over 200%? I'm getting 109% with GDP expected to rise significantly this year. Nobody checked the math here?
2021-06-14 16:29:43,stocks,"GDP doesn't accurately reflect the value of technological value. As technology becomes larger the Buffet ratio will look worse and worse.

2021-06-14 16:35:20,stocks,"Buffett ratio uses historical GDP data and the stock market is forward looking. 

It is a complete mismatch due to Corona state economy 2020 vs Stock Market Valuation 2021. It’s not like the S&P500 went bankrupt. 

In times like these it is not a useful metric."
2021-06-14 15:53:35,stocks,"A lot of you are going to get burned by trying to outsmart/time the market. Buying a bond fund is the literal worst thing you can do, and sitting on mountains of cash when the inflation risk is real also means you're going to lose money. 


I've said this over and over - we had a huge drop in the market last year. Yes, it rebounded quickly, but we've had a crash. It's extremely unlikely that we see *another* crash this soon. Could we see a correction? Sure, but if you're expecting another 35-40% drop, you may be waiting a while."
2021-06-14 17:30:26,stocks,"Crashes usually happen due to failure to redeem debts bringing down major financial institutions. 2000 bust was caused by technology companies borrowing massive amounts of money & going bankrupt & not being able to pay them back. 2008 bust was caused by house buyers borrowing massive amounts of money & getting foreclosed & not being able to pay them back.

You can argue that this is what's happening right now, and frankly I can't tell you one way or another whether it is. But market value vs. GDP alone isn't going to cause a crash. It could cause stagnation and a flat or slow moving bear market if people collectively believe the market is over valued and gradually move their money out - into what? - but a crash is not likely to happen."
2021-06-14 17:39:57,stocks,"I love me a nice buffet, hibachi style"
2021-06-14 16:21:18,stocks,"Yes.   


But you should always be worried about market conditions when you're invested in the market. So."
2021-06-14 16:40:45,stocks,How much of it is due to the GDP (the denominator) taking a beating due the pandemic? What will the ratio look like once things have opened up?
2021-06-14 17:59:15,stocks,"Yes there is going to be a correction. Maybe today, maybe in a week, maybe in a month. Only put enough money into the market that you are willing to gamble with"
2021-06-14 14:26:52,stocks,Yeah my portfolio went up 38% in the last year. Its just an 2045 retirement std etf. Looking at putting half in cash until it happens. But I need to see the stupid vertical up before I do it.
2021-06-14 14:49:25,stocks,"Yes, be worried. Reopening has been priced into most stocks and the amount of debt from margin accounts, debt of US government, material costs, inflation, worker shortage from people being paid to stay on unemployment, interest rate increase (J.P. Morgan today reported hoarding cash in anticipation of an increase). There are so many risks right now that even the reopening from COViD and infrastructure bill won’t save the stock market. Correction coming in June/July and it will be worse than the one in mid May"

2021-06-14 18:10:24,stocks,"This is getting tiresome. It's a 20th century relevant statistic.

In a globalized economy counting a country's GDP when production is overseas will obviously not account for large-caps' actual valuations.

Unless you isolate the metric to small (tops mid-caps) you're mixing loosely relevant things to make the case for what? An impeding crash? 

As I said... EXTREMELY tiresome. Put some 21st century metrics on the table or just stop the baiting/FUD/whatever this is."
2021-06-14 14:58:12,stocks,I adjusted my portfolios from 100% stocks to 80% stocks/20% bonds in anticipation of a crash. If I see at least a 20% drop in prices then I will sell the bonds and switch back to 100% stock

2021-06-14 19:57:34,stocks,"Two points I’ll make.

1. The market is where it would’ve been, assuming the same growth rate before COVID. 

Track the rate of growth over 2019, and you can see the trajectory puts us here. Even though we dropped in last March, it just grew really fast to get to this point. Now we’re starting to resume a normal pace of growth.

2. The market reflects the predicted GDP, or where it will be soon, not where it’s at currently. GDP is still low for now, but if we check the buffet indicator in say, 6 months to a year, I bet it’s pretty close to normal again.

3. Plus what other people have said about no two times in the market are the same situation"

2021-06-14 19:15:02,stocks,"Very good points, but that was the case in 2000 as well. Equities were exploding because interest rates were noting. Except this time The fed backed it self into a corner with the bond buying. If you look at the junk bond market, it had never been this much or of balance, and fixed income is usually a catalyst for most market crashes."

2021-06-14 16:19:22,stocks,Yeah I’m speculating it will be delayed with the reopening. The fed wants the economy to fully reopen before it crashes again so they will likely do anything and everything in their control that.
2021-06-14 17:51:10,stocks,"The problem with this is that the megacaps that make up the market are only ""american"" in the sense that they are headquartered here.

Truth is these companies are transnational corporations, hence the brouhaha about global minimum tax. Comparing 1990s figures to today when the earnings of said companies are increasingly international is a useless exercise. The gradual decline in interest rates also has to be factored in.

Personally I'd ignore this ""indicator"""

I have money but experience shows that they are cheaper during 90 percent of history so I am waiting.  I don’t understand the point of comments like this when you must know how many stocks are overvalued

It’s not about winning an argument on Reddit.  It’s about having money and not wanting to lose it and Reddit always being wrong because only per a bears comment and they never apologize after the stocks they recommend go down"

In hindsight, it's easy to call something predictable, but in the moment, shorting the market with the aim of not getting burnt is an almost impossible task."

2021-06-14 15:19:43,stocks,"That basically tells you everything you need to know.

For everyone quoting the aphorism: *time in the market etc* is failing to realize that that doesn't ALWAYS mean you have to have all your money allocated in one direction.  Buffett doesn't time the market, per se, but he DOES wait for wonderful companies to become attractively priced.  If a wonderful company were attractively priced right now I'd bet he'd buy it.

Additionally look at what he's bought... He DIVESTED out on long term banks he's had (except two... That should be HUGE). He's gone to a very limited portfolio of VERY safe investments (transport/telecoms/CANDY/ Medicine).  

Those are all shit hits the fan stuff to own.   

The writing is on the wall.  It's best to read it!

Best of luck!

Edit.  Buffett thinks bonds are trash city (capped upside) and look at the bond market right now....  High risk bond funds have MASSSSSSSSIVE put positions opening up on them.....

The market is hunkering down....."

2021-06-14 18:19:52,stocks,Of the company’s liquid assets. They also own private businesses that aren’t factored into that.
2021-06-14 18:24:59,stocks,The man is in his 90s. He's going to be investing far differently than somebody 60 years his junior. At some point in time mental decline sets in one way or another so even Warren Buffet is gonna start slipping in his 90s.

2021-06-14 17:09:33,stocks,Yes. Also OP math or link he copied is wrong. Currently only 109%. GDP rises and it's back in normal range. Also like another poster said fanng stocks sales go global. US market more global sales than ever.
2021-06-14 16:43:45,stocks,Most people with significant student loan debt would be on income based repayment and only paying 10% of income over 150% poverty level. I think that will have a much smaller impact than you think.

2021-06-14 19:06:31,stocks,"I mostly agree with you.  As far as actually timing a crash, it's tough if not impossible.  For the average investor I think there's ways we can prepare for a crash that don't involve precise timing or even short selling.

In this environment, for example, I don't think it's a bad idea to have inflation hedges in place, nor is it a bad idea to be ready for a taper tantrum.  The writing's on the wall.  Nothing needs to be shorted or timed to the tee, but you can put safeguards in place to ensure that when/if shit does hit the fan, you won't be completely wiped out.

It's the age-old wisdom of diversification.  I think it's just even more relevant right now, because as Paul Tudor Jones said today, this market is ""bat-shit crazy""."

The u.s. doesn't have to accept market rates on its debt. It can just refuse to issue debt instruments above its target rate and credit its creditors with new money. Then tax the excess out of the system. Easy peasy mathematically. Impossible politically."
2021-06-14 17:42:03,stocks,"They have modified cpi more than a dozen times to mask actual inflation rates. What's the difference between 8% and 15% when they pretend it's 3% and inflation is too low?

2021-06-14 19:13:22,stocks,"Not likely. Reference 1940s. High spikes of inflation at times inflated away massive debt but hyperinflation never set in.

Over the decade a chunk of dollar value will be lost and it may lose reserve status. Plus our ability to get foreign nations to easily eat up our debt may fade. But hyperinflation is unlikely."
2021-06-14 17:32:04,stocks,"It’s not really a big deal if it goes a little above 2%. I believe it’s been below 2% since the like 90s or something. The only way this is huge is if the market reacts to it. Some valuations will fall but if it’s a good company it will definitely go higher. Which is why it’s a picker’s market right now. You can invest in value stocks if you’re not confident in growth but the growth will definitely have winners. I’d say it’s a bad time to YOLO at shit that you barely know about but if you’re familiar with the company and know it’s going to be fine then it’s not really going to effect it too much. I invest aggressively but I’m confident my positions are not ludicrous. That’s my 2 cents, not that I’m a guru...."

2021-06-14 19:04:25,stocks,"With the fed buying majority of treasuries issued, isn't this mostly the case already?

Also, we've done this before. WWII debt to gdp was above 100%. We printed enough to hold treasury rates low and then told all other holders of treasuries ""lol get fucked"" while their bonds lost value against inflation."
2021-06-14 19:19:13,stocks,Yes taxing all of your higher producers to 0 will not even cover one year of the budget. We are pass any easy answers. There is not enough money to tax anymore. We are at the “we need to sell the house to make another payment” area now.
2021-06-14 18:07:18,stocks,Works great for my (fixed interest rate) mortgage too!
2021-06-14 18:35:56,stocks,"Low inflation has been a monetary policy specifically designed to transfer wealth to the rich. It has been staggeringly effective at this over the last 40 years.

A switch to a higher inflation environment is good for the economy, good for workers, and better macroeconomic policy. It rewards innovation and production rather than finance. 

There will not be hyperinflation. First off, Weimar had to pay debts in foreign currency and were allowed to borrow on international markets. They were also embroiled in a civil war and nobody was paying taxes. This is not the USA, which has the strongest economy in human history, unprecedented military power, and the world academic and economic leader. There is nowhere else to put money productively to use like in the USA, so dollars are always in demand."
2021-06-14 18:49:12,stocks,They are playing with fire. What if  the genie is out of the bottle and inflation hits 1000% or more? Then it might be too late. I saw it first hand in Russia in nineties. Not pretty.
2021-06-14 18:54:33,stocks,"You can look at the actual numbers (non-weighted), and you'll see that inflation really isn't anything notable. CPI numbers have been trusted for 100s of years. What makes now any different?"

2021-06-14 19:02:57,stocks,"I think our understanding of economics, currency and inflation has changed a lot. We will absolutely see results as we have not mastered anything, but we have learned to control and tame things a lot more."

2021-06-14 15:43:32,stocks,"I looked at Camping World awhile ago and liked almost everything aside from one major piece which you didn’t mention here: capital distributions. I don’t remember exactly how much, but the company’s cash flow is not as substantial as it might appear. They make frequent cash distributions to their LLC investors which doesn’t get deducted in their operating cash flows. When I saw this, the valuation looked a lot less attractive and gave me some bad vibes. With that said though, I definitely like the CEO and his TV show."
2021-06-14 14:46:42,stocks,The opinion of camping world among rv owners is pretty low. This is also a best a pump and dump stock. At some point in the next two years we will see a massive drop in new RV sales as well given how many were sold in the last year.
2021-06-14 15:49:25,stocks,"Thanks for bringing that up. I actually didn’t know about that, I’m going to look into it. 

It gives me bad vibes though too. I already thought their cash flow was a little weak considering how much long-term debt they have"
2021-06-14 15:29:57,stocks,"Thanks for bringing that up, i have struggled to find recent customer satisfaction for camping world. I definitely noticed some people hate buying from there on online RV boards. 

I don’t agree with the growth though. Unless you have found other sources, what I’ve seen in articles and projections is that RV sales are expected to continue growing, though you can definitely argue that the growth could de-accelerate but that’s different than a massive decline in sales. 

I’m not even going to comment on pumps, looking for a good discussion on the actual company’s prospects not speculation on pumps"
2021-06-14 16:18:25,stocks,"The reason why I say sales can not stay as high as they are now is because I think there will be a lot of used RV's hitting the market in a few years for a few reasons

\- RVing is a lot more expensive then many people realize

\- Its getting harder and harder to book campgrounds because there are so many people into the hobby.

2021-06-14 13:52:54,stocks,"While I can see the potential for growth wish is a no go for me due to the fact they sell low quality products. I bought off wish twice before I decided to uninstall the app because I was disappointed with both purchases. Neither products were like the product advertised and after waiting months for delivery buyers remorse was strong. 
There's literally memes about how crappy wish products are.."
2021-06-14 13:38:36,stocks,"Wish (logistics) local and pick up are why I bought shares in it. It would be limited growth potential without fixing the delivery issues. So the fact they tackling that problem, is a good thing.

Cheap or poor quality products doesn't bother me, as you get what you pay for. If I buy a drone for 10$ that supposed to cost 200$, I should lower expectation.

The amount of people wasting a few dollars on apps and in game purchases, shows their a huge market for cheap low cost items. As long as delivery is quick and priced correctly"
2021-06-14 15:37:31,stocks,I bought a few shares cuz why not. If it ends up going tits up I wont have lost much and if it goes up well I consider that free money
2021-06-14 16:51:38,stocks,Wish to me is the new AMC. there is some inherent value there that after all the pumping and dumping could still be worth something. so if you want to join a meme stock play but you're worried about bagholding this one isn't too bad. buy under $10 though.
2021-06-14 14:24:47,stocks,"I saw that it was dipping, so I bought some."

2021-06-14 14:14:58,stocks,You should stick to one sector at a time but you don’t really need to be an expert on it.
2021-06-14 15:20:28,stocks,"I dont think you need to stick to 1 sector as long as its a business you can understand. Known as a circle of competence. For example you would understand home builders like toll brothers, and you would also get zillow. 2 different sectors same circle of competence."
2021-06-14 16:42:00,stocks,Are looking to purchase individual stocks? Do you already own Index ETFs to ensure diversification independent from your individual stocks?  My first thought is don’t limit yourself to stocks from just one sector and definitely don’t feel you need to own stocks from each sector.
2021-06-14 15:35:32,stocks,"Second this, and would also like to add that you should be familiar with what typical fundamentals are in your given sector. Tech stocks will have a higher P/E and P/FCF than industrials or financials, but you have to compare them to the sector average to get any meaningful information from them. 

FINVIZ does a pretty good job of highlighting the fundamentals in red/green based on the average fundamentals of the sector, so that's a good place to start.

You don't *necessarily* have a stick to one sector at a time, as a good portfolio should have many different sectors in it, but fundamentals should always take the sector into account, and you should get to know the fundamentals of the industry rather than the specifics of how it operates IMO. 

If you start with a sector you know, you have the advantage of knowing more about the companies in the space. At the same time, it's easy to overvalue a company that way too."

This only raises chances to pass FDA approval, especially considering they are trying to show that they are working towards cures for diseases without current cures this year. Approval vote is 7-2-21 and only expect price to fluctuate upwards until then. 

Do your own DD but its my PERSONAL opinion that the stock is a great opportunity even without considering it’s possible position if it passes FDA. Just trying to bring attention to a good opportunity incase it doesnt hit the big movers tab, even though it was up 13.24% today."

First, no one is doing what they do.  Using blockchain to make an immutable record for commodities trading, establish finance for smaller commodities traders.  This is a huge Market that is still in the dark ages of paper and pencil.  

Aggressively acquiring businesses to expand their market area and partnerships to provide international money exchange for customers.

Shorts beat this up with speculative claims. Currently shorted to the maximum but climbing back higher.  

Average price target is 16.00 a share.  Looks like a good entry points still as solid support established at 6.70 resistance seems to be 7.00

Really high call volume at the 7.50 level.

Not suggesting to drop your life savings into it but there is potential for very sold gains."

However, financials have been scarce, it has been impossible to know when the next earnings report will be filed, and lawsuit proceeding have caused negatively for a long time now. When that all changes a lot could happen. Best guess right now is June 30th, unless an extension is filed.

As I said, I am long here, but not real bullish. I guess my rating is HOLD."

I agree the earnings report audit issue is certainly a cause to pause.  However with their activities with securing partnerships ( western union ) and their acquisitions balance that out to me.  

As I said in the title, moderate risk, not a sure thing.  At it's current price I'd still say it's a buy.  If it's 8 or above I'd say hold for that information to come out.

With the current buying frenzies in heavily shorted stocks, and this is certainly shorted to the max, it could easily spike much higher and provide nice gains for those who get in at the current prices"

Said he was looking to make acquisitions and expand the business, but then flip flopped and bought shares despite having low capital.

2021-06-14 11:24:41,stocks,">According to the research report, the global Breast Cancer Treatment Market was estimated at USD 19.24 Billion in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 34.06 Billion by 2026. The global Breast Cancer Treatment Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.5% from 2019 to 2026

**Observation**

* Zero debt
* \>$130m cash on hand
* Cash stated to last them well into 2024 calendar year
* Great management
* around $3m quarterly spending
* Has recently ramped up quarterly spending
* recently stated to be aggressively pushing for phase 3 trials
* recently approved to conduct trials in EU market
* drug has several other beneficial uses besides breast cancer (versatile)
* has found a new & higher support level after recent ""buy the news sell"" off
* Russell 2k on 25th will trend pps upwards
* Recently canceled proposal to increase share dilution

**Thoughts**

Any good news will give investors something to smile about either short term or long term.

The monopoly the company will hold over this drug will spark a crazy bidding war when its time for a buyout. AND the talks of seeking a partnership will ensure companies seeking to buy them out come correctly with a sizable offer. I saw **ITOS**  partnership announcement earlier in the cancer space. That's just for phase 1 trials. Giving me even more confidence in a partnership since **ATOS** will be entering phase 3 trials. The best event this month is the upcoming russell 2k. Indices will be snapping up bulks of shares. Right now investors are in what I call ""the before."" Before major indices join in, before the market cap reaches >$1B which will make it stable and bring a new wave of investors institutional & retail alike. Before news networks start talking about this company. Before social media and the internet spread into the mix. Once it's approved in the USA/EU market- that's pretty much a global market guarantee. I'm just so overwhelmingly confident in this company.

**Feelings**

Didn't feel to good about the loss I took in last weeks dip. It hurt. I held true to my convictions though because I do believe in this company. IF NOT FOR ANY OTHER REASON, then for the gains I'm certain I'll make in the future as investor. I'm more than happy with today's movements. My sentiments are satisfactory so far.

**Conclusion**

More people need to talk about this on reddit. We've essentially became our own source for support in the market. For better or for worse. We are also the key catalyst in companies hitting the internet and spreading chatter. I'm glad to see talk of it on this subreddit growing, slowly, but surely."
2021-06-14 10:58:39,stocks,"ATOS breast cancer drug is far superior to the one that is currently used today, primarily because of the lack of side effects that one experiences when using the drug daily.

2021-06-14 15:07:37,stocks,"Good analysis. I'm also long on ATOS.

I found old data [from this site noting](https://web.archive.org/web/20080516032316/http://www.bioportfolio.com/news/datamonitor_16.htm) Tamoxifen sales were $1b in 2001, and Endoxifen is expected to supercede Tamoxifen, so assuming zero growth since 2001 and if we purely [adjust for inflation that's $1.5b of annual sales](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/).

Assume results are great, Endoxifen becomes the new standard of care and takes over that $1.5b in sales. So, using a P/S of 5 (like an astrazeneca or pfizer) that's 5 x $1.5b = $7.5b mkt cap = $62 SP. This ignores other products ATOS is developing. Hard to find recent/reliable/free industry data."
2021-06-14 17:04:52,stocks,"I think you should look into their clinical trials first. I just did a quick search in the clinical trials database, and it looks like they have not even started recruiting for their phase 2 trials in Australia. This drug has so far to go for being approved in the US. 

For comparison, Tamoxifen, which was invented in the 60s and not approved for use until 1977, isn’t even close to the most commonly prescribed breast cancer medication. 

To get numbers like you’re predicting, this drug would have to be worth multiples more than Tamoxifen is to get significant revenue. Additionally, the company that started with the trials and research for Tamoxifen wasn’t even the one that ended up getting it approved and manufactured for most uses, it was sold to Zeneca (now AstraZeneca). 

And tamoxifen is approved for many more uses than treating breast cancer, it’s also approved for preventing, which didn’t happen until 1998. So after existing on the market since 1977 the value of this drug is only $1bn in 2001, for all it’s combined indicated uses. 

For comparison, most of the newest standard of care cancer meds have market shares of over $10bn per year per company. That’s not even including the combined generic market. This drug is so worthless right now you’d be foolish to invest in it. 

Just my two cents.

The company has numerous police departments already using the technology and many others in pilot programs.

There is an obvious need for police departments to have an option between a gun and a Taser, and Bola wrap fits perfectly.  It’s a non-lethal Kevlar cord that wraps the suspect tightly.  It can be deployed on fleeing suspects, mentally ill who need to be restrained etc etc.  take a look!"

2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Is $WKHS a good buy after their dip? **Can Workhorse Find the Strength to Bounce Back?**

The [USPS Next generation Delivery Vehicle Project](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2021/0223-multi-billion-dollar-modernization-of-postal-delivery-vehicle-fleet.htm) was recently awarded to Oshkosh Defense, which had extreme effects on the share price of [$WKHS – Workhorse.](https://utradea.com/stocks/WKHS) However, the question I wanted an answer to is did this occurrence make Workhorse an undervalued growth stock, or is Workhorse still overvalued even after their share price was massacred? This question led me to undergo this analysis to find out.

**Company Overview:** 

Workhorse is a technology company focused on renewable, and cost-effective solutions in the transportation sector (they make EV’s). Workhorse is an all-American electric delivery truck, and drone manufacturer that is constantly looking for new ways to innovate and optimize their mechanisms. Workhorse is currently working on bringing their [C-Series](https://workhorse.com/cseries.html) electric **delivery trucks** to the market to fulfill previous order request. Workhorse is an OEM trying to satisfy the requirements for their Class 2 – Class 6 commercial-grade, medium-duty truck market.

Workhorse has highlighted some of the biggest benefits derive from using their vehicles, these include:

· Lower total cost-of-ownership compared to conventional gasoline/diesel vehicles (estimated to save $170k in fuel savings compared to their fossil fuel counterparts)

· Increased package deliveries per day through the use of more efficient delivery methods

· Improved profitability through lower maintenance costs and reduced fuel expenses

· Improved vehicle safety and driver experience.

Currently, Workhorse is selling their vehicles to their clients using the following distributors Hitachi, Ryder, and Pritchard. Furthermore, 2 of their distributors (Ryder and Pritchard) are also maintenance providers for Workhorse.

Currently, Workhorse has successfully delivered 370 electric delivery vehicles to their customers, and they are the only American OEM to reach these figures, which is quite the accomplishment. These customers consist of the following companies Alpha Baking, [FedEx](https://utradea.com/stocks/FDX), Fluid Market Inc., Pride Group Enterprises, Pritchard, [Ryder](https://utradea.com/stocks/R), [UPS](https://utradea.com/stocks/UPS), and WB Mason.

Workhorse’s Series-C delivery truck comes in 2 configurations, a 650 cubic ft., and a 1,000 cubic ft configuration. Furthermore, their Series-C vehicles include lightweight materials, 360-degree camera’s, collision avoidance, best-in-class turning radius, and their very own roof mounted [HorseFly delivery drone.](https://workhorse.com/horsefly.html) These features help to set Workhorse apart from both their electric and fossil fuel competitors, especially their roof-mounted drone.

**Investment Information:**

*USPS Next Generation Delivery Vehicle Project:*

Last year, Workhorse was in competition to win a USPS contract to manufacture 165,000 vehicles for USPS to order and use as mail delivery vehicles. There were 4 other participants in this program, and Workhorse delivered 6 of their prototype vehicles for testing to potentially win this contract. On February 23rd, 2021, it was announced that Workhorse would not be obtaining this contract, but rather Oshkosh Defense.

This came as a surprise to many people and investors and WKHS share price was greatly affected by this news. However, this also created a buying opportunity for investors, as this contract was not the be all and end all of Workhorse’s business. Workhorse still manufactures their electric vehicles and has great potential in the EV Trucking space.

*HorseFly Technology:*

As I previously mentioned, Workhorse has their HorseFly drones built into their delivery vehicles. These HorseFly drones are patented, unmanned, and are incorporated into Workhorse’s delivery vehicles in order to deliver packages more efficiently.

These HorseFly drones are capable of carrying up to 10 pounds of packages (payload) and can reach maximum speeds at approximately 50 mph (80km/hr).

The HorseFly system includes an aircraft, a Ground Control Station (GCS), supports takeoff/landing, and has a cargo handling system. This system is designed to support high volumes of packages, long days of use, little maintenance is required, and the system allows Remote Pilots in Command (RPIC) allowing one pilot to control multiple drones.

Workhorse’s drones have been proven to be safe, reliable, and capable of delivering packages.

*Metron:*

Workhorse has a cloud-based, remote management system to trach vehicular performance, which they have called “Metron”. [Metron](https://workhorse.com/metron.html) collects data and signals while the truck is driving and stores this data in their database and is shared to their clients. This data will be used to map specific route parameters to better manage the battery power, which can help maximize efficiency and determine the ideal times and locations to charge their batteries.

*Partnerships:*

*Duke Energy:* 

Workhorse has entered into a partnership with [$DUK - Duke Energy](https://utradea.com/stocks/DUK) to create an innovative battery leasing program that provides customers with options and cost-competitive alternatives. Duke can also provide depot-wide electrification, battery leasing, and distributed energy resources to Workhorse’s customers. Duke and Workhorse \[partnered to make an integrated solution to help reduce the costs of converting existing fleets to quicken their adoption.

*Moog:*

Workhorse has also partnered with a company called [$MOG-A - Moog](https://utradea.com/stocks/MOG-A). This partnership is a joint venture (50%-50%) for the development of the unmanned aerial systems (UAS), (their drones). Teams from both Workhorse and Moog are working on developing these drones, their systems, and their sub-systems to improve their quality and make them the most capable UAS in the market. Their goal for these UAS is to be highly reliable, safe, and certified by the highest levels of government approval.

*Emission and Fuel Economy Standards:*

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issues increasingly stringent fuel/emission standards for 2021-2027. In this document they highlight Workhorse as a “vocational vehicle” manufacturer, which makes Workhorse eligible for flexibility and incentive programs, such as the [Averaging, Braking, and Trading Program (ABT).](https://www.epa.gov/ve-certification/averaging-banking-and-trading-abt-report-template-and-guidance-locomotive-engines) This program allows fuel consumption credits to be banked, traded, or averaged. This will allow Workhorse to sell these credits to companies who have larger than mandated emissions.

*Clean Air Act:*

Workhorse has already acquired their Certificate of Conformity from the EPA. This certificate is required to be able to sell vehicles in states covered by the Clean Energy Act (ie. California).

*Intellectual Property:*

Workhorse currently has 8 existing patents, 1 of which is Canadian and covers their vehicle chassis assembly, and the other 7 are American covering vehicle chassis assembly, vehicle headers, onboard generator system, UAS package delivery system, and their drive module. Additionally, Workhorse has 19 pending patent applications.

Furthermore, Workhorse has 14 issued trademarks (US, and Internationally) and has filed for 5 more trademarks.

*Property:*

Workhorse owns 2 pieces of real estate, one of which is their 250,000 sq ft manufacturing plant in Union City, Indiana, and the other is a 45,000 sq ft administrative, manufacturing, and R&D plant in Loveland, Ohio.

Furthermore, Workhorse leases 2 factories which are also located in Loveland, Ohio.

It is good to see that Workhorse has purchased these 2 factories as they will have greater control over what they chose to do and their methods of manufacturing. Also, paying off equity in these 2 factories is essentially paying down an asset.

*Financial Information:*

· **2016 Stock Incentive Plan:** Currently, there are still 102,500 shares yet to be converted from existing warrants from Workhorses 2016 stock incentive plan. If these shares were to be converted and dumped into the market, it would cause a dilutionary effect of 0.08%

· **2017 Stock Incentive Plan:** Currently, there are 2,247,500 common shares, and 1,475,625 shares that can be converted from warrants that are yet to hit the market from Workhorse’s 2017 stock incentive plan. If these shares were to be put on the market this year, it would cause dilutionary effect of roughly 3.02% on existing shares.

· **2019 Stock Incentive Plan:** There are also 773,115 common shares that can be converted from warrants, and 4,332,011 shares that are yet to be issued from Workhorse’s 2019 stock incentive plan. If these shares were to be converted and dumped into the market, it would cause dilutionary effect of roughly 4.14%

· **Series B Preferred Stock:** In 2019, Workhorse offered some Series B Preferred Shares to accredited investors. Workhorse sold 1,250,000 of these shares, and each of these preferred shares can be converted into 7.41 common shares. If all of these preferred shares were converted there would be 9,262,500 common shares, however, we know that in 2019 and 2020, 1.6M shares were issued through the conversion of preferred shares. Meaning that there is a maximum of 7,662,500 common shares that can be converted. If all of the remaining preferred shares were to be converted, then it would cause a dilutionary effect of roughly 6.22%

· **2024 Convertible Notes:** Currently, there is $197.7M worth of convertible notes, which are convertible at $35.29/share. This means that there are 5,602,154 shares that can be converted from these notes. If this were to happen, existing shares would exhibit dilutionary effects of 4.55%.

· **Marathon Warrant Agreement:** In 2018, Workhorse sold Marathon Asset Management a warrant to purchase 8,053,390 shares for an exercise price of $1.25. If these warrants were to be exercised and sold, there would be dilutionary effects of 6.53%.

· **RSU and Options:** In Workhorses stock-based compensation they also offer options and restricted stock units (RSU), and as of December 2021, there are 1.97M shares available from options to be purchased at $2.10/share (exercisable over the next 1.8 years), and 1.37M shares in RSU’s (which is expected to be recognized over the next 1.7 years). If all of these options are exercised, and the RSU’s are vested then there will be dilutionary effects of 2.72%.

· **Financial Performance (Good):** Workhorse had a great year in 2020, as their net sales increased by 269.80% (and their cost of sales only increased by 123.56%), their net income was $69.78M (which is the first time they have reported a positive net income), they reported revenue from their drones for the first time, and they paid off $19.14M in long-term debt.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** Workhorse’s gross loss increase by 113.35% however their surge in “other income” helped to prop up earnings (they are not making money from solely the sale of their vehicles), and their interest expense increased by 553.67%.

· **Liquidity:** Workhorse has nearly doubled their cash position YoY, from $23.9M to $46.8M. They noted that they will use some of this cash to finance projects in 2021 in their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-21-003538/)

*Management Team:*

**Duane Hughes (CEO, President, and Director):** Mr. Hughes has 20 years of direct experience and has relationships in the automotive, advertising, and technology industries. Prior to Workhorse, he worked at Cumulus Interactive Technologies Group as their COO, and prior to this he worked as VP of sales and operations for Gannett Co. Inc.

**Robert Willison (COO):** Mr. Willison previously served as the Director of Fleet Technology for Sysco Corp. Prior to Sysco, Mr. Willison worked as the CTO of Rav Technologies.

**Steve Schrader (CFO):** Mr. Schrader has over 16 years of experience in public and private companies in a variety of industries. Prior to Workhorse Steve was the CFO of Fuyao Glass America for 4 years.

**Stephen Fleming (VP):** Mr. Fleming worked at Workhorse for 9 years as corporate/securities counsel before being promoted to VP. Previously to that, Mr.Fleming served as the managing member of Fleming PLLC, which is a boutique law firm specializing in corporate/securities law.

Although these people do not have the most extensive background in the automotive industry they have a solid background in business, finance, and technology. This is good to hear as they should be able to run this business from a management standpoint, however, where these people lack expertise in the automotive field, they can consult their board of directors who have worked for companies like GM, Piston Group, Cadillac etc. This helps to create a well-rounded management team that I believe is capable of running this business properly.

**Investment Valuation:** 

Due to Workhorse’s current financial information, I am not able to create a DCF model in order to value the company. However, I was able to undergo comparable analyses, in which I compared Workhorse’s EV/Assets, EV/Revenue and P/B multiples to their competitors. In order to arrive at an unbiased valuation, I took a weighted average of the comparable analyses.

*EV/Assets:*

By comparing this multiple to their competition, I arrived at a fair value of $WKHS of $11.97, if this were the case the implied downside would be 22.91%.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Workhorse’s EV/Revenue multiple to their competition, I arrived at a fair value of $535.36, which would imply an upside of 3347.23%. This is absurdly high and is due to $NKLA – Nikola having an EV/Revenue multiple of 153,392.

*P/B:*

By comparing Workhorse’s P/B ratio to their competitors, I arrived at a fair value per share of $14.73, which would imply a downside risk of 5.14%.

*Weighted Average Comparable:*

Since the EV/Revenue comparable implied such a large upside I gave it a weight of 6.6% (20% of equal weight (33%).) the other two results achieve in the comparable analyses are both then weighted equally at 46.7%.

By doing this I arrived at an estimated fair value per share of $15.93, which would imply that Workhorse has a potential upside of 2.58%. This essentially means that you are buying close to fair value, which helps to mitigate risk.

*Analyst Coverage:*

The average analyst price target of 7 Wall Street analysts for $WKHS – Workhorse is $15.70, which would imply an upside of 1.09%, this implies that Workhorse is an undervalued growth stock. These estimates are similar to the results I achieved in my comparable analyses.

**Risks:**

· **Dilution:** Workhorse has had problems with their levels of dilution in the past as they have averaged 44.64% share dilution per year over the last 3 years. Furthermore, these high levels of dilution are also looking pretty likely in the future as Workhorse is yet to offer all of the shares from their 2016, 2017, and 2019 stock incentive plans, their Series B Preferred Shares, their 2024 Convertible Notes, their Warrant Agreement with Marathon Asset Management, their RSU’s, and finally their outstanding options. All of these programs, plans, and agreements will account for approximately 27.26% of future share dilution. This level of previous dilution, and the levels of expected dilution are very high, even for a high-growth, high-potential stock like Workhorse, and should worry current and potential investors alike.

· **Financial Performance:** As stated previously, Workhorse has a couple sections of their financial reports that did not look so favourable (gross loss increase, and high interest expense growth.) If Workhorse does not continue to make large sums of revenue from their “other revenue” segment, then their losses will appear bigger, and they may not report another positive year (like they did this year). This would be detrimental for the stock and scare off investors.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Workhorse increased their net sales by 269.80% (and their cost of sales only increased by 123.56%), their net income was $69.78M (which is the first time they have reported a positive net income), they reported revenue from their drones for the first time, and they paid off $19.14M in long-term debt. As stated previously, this was Workhorse’s first time reporting a positive net income on their yearly statement, this could show investors that they have turned around the business, and if they continue this performance in the future, then it will solidify this belief and attract investors.

· **Social Sentiment:** According to [Utradea’s Reddit Tab](https://utradea.com/feed), Workhorse is the 4th most trending stock (in the past 24 hours) and the 9th most tending stock (in the past 48 hours) on Wall Street Bets and has an overall positive sentiment. We have seen the impact that Wall Street Bets has had on other trending stocks, so it will be interesting to see if Wall Street Bets can pump this stock for a quick return.

· **Short Squeeze Potential:** Currently, Workhorse has a short interest of 22%, which makes it a good candidate for s short squeeze. Furthermore, the short borrow rate (premium) for people/institutions to short Workhorse is at 11.91%, which can cause the shorts to have to cover quicker than usual. This stock has the potential to be squeezed, especially if Wall Street Bets takes an interest in it.

2021-06-14 11:18:17,stocks,"Once I see a stock being pumped by countless bots on WSB i automatically assume it's a pump and dump. This is one of them. Like others have said it's over valued but in my eyes....value means nothing in this current stock market. It's worth a punt based on it being a gamble that could pay off just from the amount of bots trying to pump it. Might not be the worse shout to have some stock but be ready to sell it early.  Seems risky to me but all the meme stocks have so much potential for easy money because so many other people are willing to bag hold for imaginary 1000% returns. 

When  I think of this stock I don't think of short squeeze potential, profits, growth etc....I just think....can I get in and out of this stock before it gets dumped. Seems a bit high for me to jump in on but for a bigger gambler its worth a pop."

Avoid WKHS."

That place is so overrun by HFs right now that I wouldn't touch anything that trends there."
2021-06-14 11:27:56,stocks,"Avoid $WKHS and checkout $ARVL instead. They have a contract, and investment, from UPS for 10,000 vehicles with a UPS option for another 10,000. First 10k to be delivered by 2024. Company uses a micro-factory setup which, in theory, seems great and would love to see how it plays out. Would make their ability to scale quickly if the 6 month build under $50m costs are accurate.

IMO much better play in the medium-term, but still has huge risk as they haven't delivered anything, yet."

I don't think WSB has any real affect on stocks, it's mostly manipulation from larger investors. Shorting a stock makes is highly volatile, the more short it is the more volatile. All WSB does is capitalize off the volatility on green days, but 99% of the time they're losing money not making it. You're just seeing that 1% right now and FOMOing. Without these ridiculous short positions on all these stocks, WSB would have no power. They just attack volatile plays. That's their entire strategy.

'High short interest + High volume = moon'. That's their thesis. Stock market isn't that simple"

2021-06-14 11:34:11,stocks,"Got in at $18 last month before the WSB wave due to the steel shortage news

 if it goes up till around $25, I will sell half of it and hold the rest"
2021-06-14 11:44:19,stocks,"I currently have them as barely a sell rating. After reviewing their 2020 AR I noticed a lack of cash to cover a substantial hardship, and even though they've beaten earnings 5 of the last 8 quarters, they've also lost money in 3 of the last 8 quarters. Trading at a negative P/E while the sector historically trades at 32.2 P/E doesn't help when comparing to the competition, either.

For less involved ratings, their equity score is 1.9 with 1 Buy, 4 neutral, and 2 sell ratings.

If they have a solid earnings for the upcoming quarter they could possibly become a BUY rating again if their P/E stays under the sector 5-yr P/E. I personally will not buy until they have 2 consecutive quarters of earnings growth, along with a substantial increase in their cash."

however i got into another very good steel/infrastructure company $GGB at $6.40 1,500 shares....this may be a slow mover but if you do your DD then you will see strong financials, profitable cash flow+ paying dividend and still in its pullback from $7

this is also an EPS PE ratio Divergence play as EPS is rising and this stock in the past reacts nicely to this divergence....

this is not financial advice and i am not a financial advisor

good luck"

2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Morning Update for Monday, 06/14/21 Good morning everyone! It's Monday, and I hope you had a nice weekend.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* CRSR: Gapping up above relevant SMA's. Room for further upwards movement, but I'll wait for things to settle after open. Possible support at 36 on the daily chart.
* NVAX: Possible resistance levels at 230 and 240, I'll watch for upwards movement if it can hold over 230. 
* COIN: Key resistance level right around 230. I'll be watching for the break over 230 for an opportunity to go long.
* TSLA: Seems to be holding up over the SMA(200), SMA(20), and SMA(9), after hovering around that level the past few days of trading. Could be a sign of more upwards movement, and a move up towards the SMA(50) in the near future. Possible resistance around 635 on the daily chart. 
* ITOS: Will be interesting to observe price action around the 30 level. Could fill the gap (or at least partially fill) to the downside if it breaks below 30, if it holds up, there could be more upwards movement.

Gapping DOWN:

* UPST: Possible support around 120 on the daily chart. If it can't hold above that level, it could provide some shorting opportunities.
* MRNA: Still holding above relevant SMA (SMA(9)) at the moment. If it fails to fill the gap to the upside, it could be worth a look as a short down to 210.
* RIDE: Gapping down below relevant SMA's. I'll be watching price action around the 10.00 level.
* BZ: Lots of room for downwards movement after the massive gap up on Friday. Could also see some continued momentum, so it'll be worth keeping an eye on. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open a bit higher after we saw some strength to end last week. The Fed has signaled that it intends to ease its asset purchase program at some point in the coming future. It will be interesting to see if this has an immediate effect on the market. SPY is trading a bit over 424, and will likely set a new intraday ATH. Maybe we will see some choppiness up at these levels, but I'm optimistic we'll see more strength. DIA is trading just under 345. I'll be watching price action around 343.50, if it breaks down below it could see more downwards movement. Tech stocks are continuing their strength, and QQQ could see a push to new ATH this week (currently trading just below 342). Gold and silver are down a decent amount this morning, while crude oil is up a bit. Bitcoin is currently trading around 39,300, and seems to have flipped the bearish narrative. I'm more bullish if it can get up above 39,500 and hold up. Crypto-related stocks are up quite a bit in premarket trading, as a result. Marijuana stocks are up a bit in premarket, but nothing too significant. Still worth keeping an eye on them for potential upcoming catalysts. Meme stocks are showing some revival this mornin, and are always worth following.

I'm optimistic we'll see strength today, but stay disciplined in your trades, and let's start the week off right.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)"
2021-06-14 09:03:41,stocks,Good morning. Here's to growth
2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Corsair DD and why it is a growth company in a growth industry **Gaming Market**

The gaming market is a strong growing market that has been expanding for the past two decades and is expected to keep growing. Consumer spending in 2020 on PC gaming hardware and accessories reach 4.5 billion USD while accessories [grew 81% YoY and hardware grew 57%.](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-16-pc-hardware-and-accessories-spending-grew-62-percent-in-the-us-in-2020)

Corsair manufactures hardware solutions such as fans, RAM, cooling units, PC cases and many more that have profited from the recent increase in PC hardware sales. Due to lockdowns many have been wanting to buy a PC which has shot up sales. However, this trend is not temporary as I will show.

[Steam users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/308330/number-stream-users/) a.k.a. any gamer who has a PC and play video games, have seen a very sharp growth in the past year due to the lockdown. The trend fluctuates with the lockdowns easings around the world and is always and bottom in summer months. From August 2019 to August 2020 there has been a 33% increase in steam users. August of 2020 was a time when Europe had record low covid infections (compared to winter months and beginning of pandemic) as well as America. Yet people were still playing video games at record rates. This is a clear sign that this market has grown, and the player base is hooked and not going anywhere. Since then, it had another 20% increase. Bullish af.

The biggest nonsense I have ever heard is that now that lockdown is over, gamers are going to stop gaming. Have they ever even met a gamer? Personally, I was a hardcore gamer before lockdown, and I will definitely continue to be one. The lockdown accelerated the uptake of gaming and if anything, people will be more committed to gaming. Easing of lockdown would allow for social events (e.g. LAN parties and gaming conventions) to take place that will further encourage spending on gaming products.

Investors who believe that gaming is going to fade out or that the hype is over are completely in the wrong here. Covid has only accelerated the trend and there might be a minor pullback in numbers as usually happens in the summer months, but the YoY numbers indicate that there has been a strong increase in gaming and this trend is likely to continue. You can buy the stock now at a lucrative price and when the investors realize that gaming is here to stay, they will have to buy the stock at a much higher price down the line.

**Streaming Market**

An excellent acquisition by Corsair has been buying Elgato and entering the streaming business. The streaming market was 50 billion USD in 2020 and is expected to reach 59 billion USD in 2021. It is expected to continue growing to 2028 at an [annual CAGR rate of 21%!!!](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-streaming-market#:~:text=The%20global%20video%20streaming%20market%20size%20was%20estimated%20at%20USD,USD%2059.14%20billion%20in%202021.&text=The%20global%20video%20streaming%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20grow%20at,USD%20223.98%20billion%20by%202028)

This is a huge market with a wonderful growth rate (not easy finding a market with such a growth rate) and corsair is perfectly positioned to take advantage of it. From buying the hardware to run your PC (also with products such as the capture card) to the elgato streaming deck that allows for easy streaming controls, Corsair is in the perfect position to take advantage of this growing market and be at the forefront of the hardware space.

**Financial performance**

Absolutely solid financial performance over the past year with stellar growth and very prospective in the future.

YoY revenue and profit margins have been growing at double digit rates. Revenue grew 55% and 65% from 1,163 and 1,300 to 1,702 and 1,923 million USD from Dec 2019 and March 2020 to Dec 2020 and March 2021. Q1 is usually the worst quarter of the year but they managed to get their best ever quarter!

EBITDA margins and Net Income margins have gone from around 6.5% and 0% to 13.5 and 7.7% from March 2020 to March 2021, respectively. This is showing stunning increase in operating margins which are very healthy and promise great further investment and growth.

EPS this year is expected to be 1.81. However, the CFO is usually very conservative and it could be much higher by the end of the year. (I could go on more detail about earnings growth but in this case margins are more interesting because it shows better efficiency and last year they were barely doing a profit so the earnings growth is skewed). With an EPS of 1.81 a fair value PE multiple of 20 would be 36.2. However, if you consider this is a growth stock in a growth environment, then comparable growth companies trade at 30-40 PE ratio which would indicate a price target of at least 54.3-72.4!

Additionally, they have been paying down debt from 505 million at end of the year 2019 to 321 million in 2020.

**Comparing Corsair with its closest competitor: Logitech**

Lets look at Logitech valuation metrics:

&#x200B;

||Last 12 months|Next 12 months|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio|23.4|30.1|
|EV/Sales|3.8|3.8|
|EV/EBITDA|15.9|22.6|

Corsair:

&#x200B;

||Last 12 months|Next 12 months|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio|20.4|18.8|
|EV/Sales|1.71|1.5|
|EV/EBITDA|11.5|12.9|

&#x200B;

Now if Corsair was priced as Logitech, it would indicate a price increase between 50-100%.

Additionally, much of Logitech’s offering has been focussed on working from home products, whereas Corsair is more focussed on gaming (Logitech too but not to the same extent). The working from home trend has peaked and many companies like JP Morgan have announced that they will want all their staff to return back to the office within the next months. There will still be people working from home but the trend will be declining from now.

**Ownership**

There has been negative sentiment around IPOs recently as many of them have flooded the market resulting in extreme short term price movement which has led to investors staying shy of them and believing that they are more speculative. Ownership currently sits at 62% with eagle tree capital and around 10% with other institutions.

Short interest is currently at around 19% of the float.

Overall, great company with excellent financial performance (actually makes a great profit and has super good growth ahead) and I am mega bullish on them. They also have super low valuation metrics which together make a rare combination.

**TL;DR**. Great company, great products, growing market and growing company. Super low valuations

&#x200B;

Edit: if you have any comments or feedback, please let me know.   
It is currently being driven up like crazy, but this company does have excellent value in the long term. Something to consider"
2021-06-14 12:39:57,stocks,"This is not a DD. This is a masturbatory bull case circle jerk. A DD needs downsides 


full disclosure: Own the stock, and up on the stock as of today"
2021-06-14 09:04:06,stocks,"All the bagholders at +40$ be ""Fucking finally"".

Very happy that I cost averaged at 32$ after the earnings. The fundamentals are incredibly strong."
2021-06-14 09:55:33,stocks,All of a sudden I’m seeing I’m seeing tons of CRSR posts. Who’s behind this?
2021-06-14 08:52:09,stocks,You are not investing in the company if you buy while its up 32% on just hype. Wait until the pumpers quit and get back in at 35$ or below. I agree that it was undervalued but buying now is just chasing
2021-06-14 13:31:21,stocks,"For what it's worth, I've seen a huge increase in Corsair gaming products in my country. A lot of my friends bought some Corsair gear and are very satisfied with it.

They see it as a low-cost brand with great quality. In other words, the relation between price and quality is very nice.

I definitely see it growing in time, because it's still an unknown brand to most people, at least here.

I'm not invested in it, in case you're wondering. Just my 2 cents based on my personal perspective and gaming circle. I have no idea if they price already reflects the future growth or not."
2021-06-14 15:42:36,stocks,Artificially pumped by WSB. Trimmed my position and will buy back at $31 after it dumps.
2021-06-14 10:04:16,stocks,"Going against the grain here but I’ll name a few counters:
1) 2020 was an unusual year where many gamers decided to upgrade their PCs, that’s prob why the growth rate was super high.
2) The gaming hardware industry is extremely price competitive with low barriers to entry. You can see it’s not just Corsair, logitech, Kingston and others are all fighting for market share.
3) Very little pricing power - Corsair is a price taker not setter. 
4) low product differentiation - a battery is a battery, a case is a case, a keyboard is a keyboard."
2021-06-14 10:23:53,stocks,The thing that's kept me away from companies like this is absolutely no moat.  Gamers aren't brand loyal - they're not going to stick with Corsair components just because they love Corsair if something better comes along.
2021-06-14 12:52:41,stocks,Classic dd once the company pumps to pump it even more.
2021-06-14 10:58:19,stocks,I was going to buy CRSR this morning but not doing to pay 35+ for it...
2021-06-14 14:36:09,stocks,"I think you should compare a lot more factors with Logitech than those. I think Logitech has higher margins and returns and less debt, but Corsair has grown sales significantly in the past 6 months so it is a little undervalued."
2021-06-14 12:55:51,stocks,"We over at WSB posted DD on this.

I wonder if this is why it pumped today"
2021-06-14 17:59:25,stocks,care to explain why people want to short it/bear case?
2021-06-14 11:26:04,stocks,"Well I was going to invest when it was <32, but I'm just going to go with Baba now..."
2021-06-14 11:28:39,stocks,"I have a position in Corsair because I didn't mind the valuation in the low 30s, and their financials were pretty good. 

HOWEVER, Corsair is not an aggressive growth company based on analysis estimates. All of their projected growth rates are ok but not spectacular and I think it's important to have reasonable expectations. 
Personally I see Corsair as a GARP investment."
2021-06-14 13:04:11,stocks,Thanks for the pump. I just got rid of my big fat Corsair bags I held for month.
2021-06-14 14:52:21,stocks,"Down 53% with them.

Lesson learned: dont trust stock youtubers lmao"
2021-06-14 15:47:52,stocks,"I sold today, but will be back once it hits under 35"
2021-06-14 16:28:10,stocks,Thanks for pumping this morning I was able to sell at +30% on my investment for a solid gain!
2021-06-14 16:25:55,stocks,"Wtf I didn't expect the stock to go up so much today. Wasn't even expecting anything today so I hadn't looked until now. But hey, bought at $32 so I take it."
2021-06-14 16:37:50,stocks,"I've been holding CRSR for months, I am worried everyone jumping on it is going to fuck me now"
2021-06-14 11:25:16,stocks,Corsair is not a great company.   Covid and work from home drove revenue last year.  All similar companies saw revenue go up without any changes to their business model.  There are too many companies that offer similar products.  This is a pump n dump stock that will not provide anything except bag holders.
2021-06-14 15:36:25,stocks,"From a consumer stand point, Corsair products aren’t that great. Most of their products aren’t top of the line. When you think of power supply, you think of evga, when you think of rams, you think of gskills, when you think of cases, you think of nzxt, lian li, when you think of keyboards, mouse and etc you think of Logitech, cool master, glorious and etc. I have used many of their products over the years and not really impressed with any."
2021-06-14 15:59:51,stocks,Up 11.21% today so I'm glad I bought them last Monday.  Jon Najarian  on CNBC just said this one has room to run.
2021-06-14 16:20:33,stocks,"I have to say this is very true. Lots of subjective opinion in there too. Things like:  


>The biggest nonsense I have ever heard is that now that lockdown is over, gamers are going to stop gaming. Have they ever even met a gamer? Personally, I was a hardcore gamer before lockdown, and I will definitely continue to be one.

This is a conjecture of the highest order and obviously biased.

I own the shares and I like the stock but this isn't great DD."
2021-06-14 16:31:05,stocks,"We get these fake corsair DD every week now.   

As if we really needed another pump for anyone who forgot in the last five days."
2021-06-14 15:40:15,stocks,"Seriously up on the stock today. +15% that’s amazing, I don’t have a great deal of shares but I’m glad I bought when I did."
2021-06-14 10:02:54,stocks,I've been bagholding at $35 for a while. This morning was a pleasant surprise'
2021-06-14 12:25:34,stocks,"That's what my account says but My cost is around 35, but they couldn't wait a week to pump it my poor 35 calls"
2021-06-14 09:45:04,stocks,And good products.  My new Corsair case is almost as nice as my Lian Lee ones I bought for years.
2021-06-14 09:13:16,stocks,agreed!
2021-06-14 10:45:51,stocks,Bots and paid shills most likely.
2021-06-14 11:34:12,stocks,Idk but my $32 entry price loves it
2021-06-14 08:59:18,stocks,"Pumpers gonna pump. I don’t want to see people getting burned but boy is it hilarious when a pump and dump, dumps, and people go full pikachu face like what! How is this possible! They all said it’s going to the moon! Lmao"
2021-06-14 09:15:54,stocks,"Was actually waiting for my next deposit coming friday to buy into corsair, been eyeballing it since a bit. Guess I'll wait till the pump & dump is over.."
2021-06-14 08:59:24,stocks,Do you know what's happening with it right now? I checked this morning and suddenly it's up ~30%... Is it being pumped by the meme stock crowd or something?
2021-06-14 16:21:51,stocks,Sold at 39 and bought back in at 36 - comfortable with that to be honest.
2021-06-14 17:37:07,stocks,Sell puts
2021-06-14 09:25:52,stocks,I got in at $35 during pre-market lol
2021-06-14 09:05:02,stocks,"It has definitely gone up like crazy today. Either way once the dust settles, it is a financially solid company without questions. In the short it can be sporadic but in the long term, it definitely has value. I bought in at 31 and have been a bag holder for quite some time. Play this how you want and perhaps keep it on your radar to see what happens"
2021-06-14 17:21:26,stocks,lol closed at 36. the pump is already done.
2021-06-14 18:25:08,stocks,Yeah I had a sell order for 42$ that didn't fill. Guess I got too greedy.. either way still holding at an average of 34$ not too concerned about it.
2021-06-14 10:16:25,stocks,"some good points.   
1) as I mentioned that this sudden trend is likely to continue. Also many people still waiting for the opportunity to buy graphics card. If they go back in the market they will continue buying CRSR products.   
Points 2 and 3 kind of similar. So I agree with you it is a competitive market, but if you look at customer satisfaction, corsair has a lot of loyalty and very satisfied customers. Good brand recognition and perspective is even more valuable here.   
4) thats an over generalization IMO. An electric car is not any electric car e.g. tesla is not the same as volkswagen for example. Corsair also has entered the streaming platform with elgato so that is another industry. For many enthusiasts, Corsair products provide excellent customization that they want"
2021-06-14 11:25:56,stocks,"yeah, but that's Corsair's moat. It's the company with products of the highest quality. Once a gamer uses their products it will be difficult for them to adjust downwards in term of quality. It's building an Apple-like reputation in terms of quality and performance (okay, not quite like Apple, but you get the point)"
2021-06-14 18:57:28,stocks,Samesies
2021-06-14 17:38:10,stocks,LOGI’s strong YoY net profit margin is largely due to a tax adjustment that will reverse out over 10 years
2021-06-14 18:25:44,stocks,"It could be that the shorts are holding it from much higher prices like 50 area. Additionally, the biggest bear case is that some people believe that post lock down they will not do as well. So this increase in revenue and profits is temporary. (though I personally doubt it as you could gather from my post and they said they still had high demand and not enough supply on many products). These are only my opinions, make sure you yourself know the company and what price you are willing to invest in :)"
2021-06-14 15:01:42,stocks,It's up huge today lmao wtf
2021-06-14 16:33:44,stocks,You won't have to wait long
2021-06-14 12:04:30,stocks,3B market cap with 2B revenue guidance for 2021. It’s clear Covid boosted 2020 numbers but they also are showing that they will continue to grow revenue and profits.
2021-06-14 17:40:38,stocks,"Uhhh I don’t think of those cases, keyboards or mouses. Cases sure but I don’t think of nzxt. Keyboard and mouses for sureeeee as hell don’t think of Logitech. Corsair has one of the best keyboards on the market with the K95 and the M65 mouse. Those alone are still in the upper tier in my opinion."
2021-06-14 11:53:15,stocks,Yeah about what I'm at as well. The great thing about run-ups like this on companies you're long on is that you get to sell covered calls far oom at a huge premium to lower your cost basis.
2021-06-14 17:26:45,stocks,I bought a little mousepad for my computer and it's really nice. Wish my desk was big enough for the led one they have though.
2021-06-14 18:48:40,stocks,They got me with the power supplies. You start appreciating good quality PS when your PC starts randomly turning off and when it decides to burn your MB.
2021-06-14 14:54:46,stocks,Yep. Wsb pump and dump and these bots have flooded r/stocks too. It's similar to pltr.
2021-06-14 16:32:31,stocks,Hold
2021-06-14 09:02:57,stocks,"A bunch of people posted DD's to WSB on Thursday/Friday. You could see the launch starting on Friday, when near market close the price jumped $1 from $31.50 to $32.50.

Personally I love the company and think it's getting to the price that it's fairly valued at, but it'll probably dump and head back to around $34/35 eventually in the next couple of days if not sometime today.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Quick discussion around US Inflation Alright, let's talk a bit more about US inflation.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strategists-still-dont-think-inflation-is-a-problem-for-stocks-morning-brief-100322032.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strategists-still-dont-think-inflation-is-a-problem-for-stocks-morning-brief-100322032.html)

So, they keep talking about the 10-year US bond yield as a signal that the market has ""shrugged off"" inflation concerns. Has it though? It has gone down, yes. But maybe, just maybe, it is because the Fed is doing everything they can to keep bond yields low? Up until last month, the Fed expectation was that rates would be hiked up in late 2021-mid-2022. Now, the expectation is 2023. Remember, low interest rates tend to lead to high inflation (low interest makes savings and bonds worthless). Also, actual inflation continues to beat Fed expectations every month. For April, the Fed expected 3.6%. They got 4.2%. For May, they expected 4.7%. They got 5%! They keep revising their expectations up and up and up. If inflation was a stock, I would buy it!

So, when was the last time it was this high? June to September of 2009. **12 years ago**. Inflation also steadily increased then, it did not spike. Before that? May 1991 which followed a year of sustained inflation over 5%. **30 years ago**. I know that the Fed keeps saying that we've had weird circumstances, but it's not like we've had negative inflation at any point since March 2020 so... what are you on about, Fed?

Granted, we've only had 1 month of 5% inflation. For now. However, we also have:

* $120bln that the Fed is pumping into the economy every month.
* the $500bln in its reverse repo (money that's been essentially been taken OUT of circulation).
* almost 0% interest rates, which will not be lifted until 2023 (current expectation).
* commodity prices rising across the board due to shortages.
* rising labour costs and record job vacancies because people make more money staying at home than working.
* an increasing government spending.
* the housing markets across the world at an all-time high.

Should I keep going?

Hope that gives you a good idea where we stand right now with inflation! I really want to hear your opinion on this :)"
2021-06-14 11:36:51,stocks,"It wouldn't affect my holding decisions one way or another, but I believe the fed about this inflation being transitory. The bond market also seems to agree with me, as long term yields have been coming down for 3 months. The 5% core CPI reflects extreme comps from a year ago - the money markets didn't even flinch when that number printed. Those numbers are more like 2.5% if you comp to 2019 numbers.

Again even if I'm wrong, I don't see a reliable alternative to buying and holding stocks so it changes nothing for me. Just want to register that opinion because the inflation hype is definitely over-represented on here."
2021-06-14 08:02:06,stocks,[removed]
2021-06-14 12:12:14,stocks,"We’re getting close to the end. Ask your parents what a savings account paid out when they were your age. Our economy and buying power are completely shot, along with the bond market. The only way you can even try to keep up is with equities. Eventually that’ll collapse too, but the fed can kick that can down the road just a little more."
2021-06-14 09:17:26,stocks,"Everything you’ve listed is either directly deflationary or signals transient inflation. Sustainable, across the board inflation can only happen if we either see a permanent expansion of the money supply or full employment.

Obviously we don’t have the second.

To the first, the Fed has no idea how much money there is, nor can they create permanent money except in the event of bank runs. What they do create is bank reserves, which operate as a clearing house cash equivalent within the confines of the financial sector. People want to say this is equivalent to cash, but it simply isn’t. This money lives at the Fed, and can only be traded to other banks or used to write loans against. If thats not enough for you, Japan has led the way in QE and has only seen very low inflation or deflation despite it.

But they can just make loans against the reserves, right? Well, they’re not making many loans since 2008, which is born out in the money velocity sharply decreasing since the same time. The banks are worried about *deflation*, like we saw in 2008, and refuse to be on the hook if it happens again.

Look, the idea of inflation coming in and punishing the excesses of government is a super desirable idea. I bought silver in 2009 after buying into the same logic, and prices still haven’t recovered to what I bought it at. The fact of the matter is government and public debt are two giant deflation bombs that will swallow our economy unless we see more and more debt growth. And all the banks are standing by and waiting for this to happen since they don’t want to be on the hook, while the government launches program after program to try and inject money into the economy to stave off **deflation**.

The only thing I don’t know is how long does this game last. It could end this year. Or the treasury and the Fed could spin this along for another 5. Either way I’m all in betting long end interest rates (10Y, 30Y) are going to 0."
2021-06-14 12:20:31,stocks,US gov spends like a drunken sailor. You can't make 6t dollar spending bills every other month and not have inflation.
2021-06-14 08:04:00,stocks,"First off equities are inflation protected because whatever the products or services they provide are valued in dollars.  So you can buy the stock inflation!

Inflation will be difficult to have in the USA because our population doesn’t change much.  Second people aren’t getting paid much more.  So with those two if they don’t change the average inflation will be about what it was pre pandemic.  ~1.5-3%.

Note that doesn’t mean we cant hit 6% this year followed by 0% the year after."

2021-06-14 11:49:30,stocks,"I tend to distrust the Fed simply because of history :D I'm not sure when they've been honest and transparent about their actual goals (provided that they realised their goals. If that wasn't the case, then they are simply incompetent and, again, we shouldn't be listening to them IMO). Plus, even Ray Dalio says it, if the government comes out and says ""Don't worry, we'll support a strong dollar"", the next thing you can expect is a devaluation of the dollar. The Fed is trying extremely hard to control this narrative of transitory inflation and I don't believe them. Obviously, I could be wrong, but it's really hard to think of transitory inflation when there are so many inflation indicators spiking.

Also, I know that everyone is talking about extreme measure last year, but at least price-wise (and therefore inflation-wise), there were no massive changes! Apart from oil, I guess, but that's a tiny bit of the inflation index. Food prices spiked last year, but now they continue to rise. Housing prices are hitting ATH, etc. Obviously it could be a temporary bottleneck, but the Fed seems to downplay everything even when the stats are way worse that they make them out to be. I guess they want to avoid panic in the markets, but when the hell did it become their priority to look after the markets? it's just a weird situation and from what I'm seeing in the stats and so on, everything is leaning towards prolonged high inflation, e.g. 5% or more.

I guess we'll see next month and the month after. There's really nothing we can do apart from speculation until we see the actual number :)

You're right though, it's hard to see what this changes. I'm also long stocks, but I've switched more and more towards value and commodity producers to benefit from inflation. I think some of these hyped up growth stocks will plunge in the next few months.

Edit: Adding link for my reasoning of Fed distrust: [https://www.ft.com/content/46450be2-99dd-43ec-a9f3-9cf3c60d72e1](https://www.ft.com/content/46450be2-99dd-43ec-a9f3-9cf3c60d72e1) (It's Financial Times, they tend to be trustworthy for now :D)"

2021-06-14 11:33:23,stocks,"Sorry, I don't understand. How is the government printing $120bln a month not expanding the money supply? I'm sure everyone here has seen this chart a 100 times, but the M2 Money Supply is growing exponentially! [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)

There is hardly any chance of seeing bank runs! In fact, the banks are overflowing with money! The Fed's overnight reserve repo which has just gone past half a trillion is where **banks put excess money**. Essentially, the banks give the Fed a 15-day loan for a minimal return and they can only do that right now because of the minimum capital requirements introduced in the wake of the GFC. Nothing else has such low capital requirements as lending money to the Fed.

How are rising labour costs deflationary? Rising salaries equal higher spending equal higher prices, e.g. inflation. Plus, we're at another pandemic unemployment low so we are getting closer to full employment in the US. In fact, some people are unwilling to go back to work because they're collecting fat unemployment checks! Teen employment is now highest since 1953 because they're cheap labour and their wages have still gone up :D[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/teen-employment-summer-best-1953/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/teen-employment-summer-best-1953/)

Plus, we're seeing continued upticks in commodity prices around the world.

You're right, Japan's QE has had a different result, but Japan is not the US. The yen is not the global reserve currency. What the Japanese government does has much less impact than the US government, IMO. Plus, we've seen the amount of investors talking about inflation. Even Warren Buffett said it was worrying and he is usually nonchalant about macroeconomic factors.

You're long interest rates so you must be long inflation, right? I was also looking at the Fed's inflation expectations (not that they are a reliable measure given everything that we've seen recently) and they are spiking! [https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce#/inflexp-2](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce#/inflexp-2) \- the median 1-year inflation prediction is 5.3% which is worrying! (P.S. If you have a better source of data, I'd love that, I haven't been able to find anything else so far!)

Thanks for your detailed reply! It's good to see a thought-out opposition to my arguments :) Most people on here just either agree 100% or infer that I'm an idiot for thinking we could see higher inflation :D

P.S. FT also seems to think that we are looking very inflationary right now: [https://www.ft.com/content/46450be2-99dd-43ec-a9f3-9cf3c60d72e1](https://www.ft.com/content/46450be2-99dd-43ec-a9f3-9cf3c60d72e1)"

2021-06-14 08:17:52,stocks,"Well, that is true for stocks as a whole, but we've seen some nasty moves around inflation recently. Plus, there are better alternatives: gold, silver, platinum, etc.

There's no real link between inflation and population, not a strong one at least. 
Secondly, people are getting more money in unemployment benefits than working some jobs which is putting pressure on employers - that was one of my points. To cope with that, they need to raise salaries. There was an in-depth interview about this which I watched on Friday. Some employers are PAYING people to go to interviews! Teen employment is the highest since WW2 because they are cheap labour. Wages are not up significantly... Yet. But they will be. So will inflation.

Edit: link - https://www.cbsnews.com/news/teen-employment-summer-best-1953/

""One reason for the turnaround could be due to higher pay, with companies bumping up entry-level wages to attract job applicants. Wages for teens in service-sector jobs have increased 8% in the last two months alone, according to an analysis from Gusto of small businesses that use its payroll services. For instance, jobs for teens working in tourism have increased from about $9.30 an hour in March to $13.50 in May, Gusto found."""
2021-06-14 12:06:30,stocks,"The FedGov hasn’t altered its policy with the money printer. They fund their expenses by selling bonds.

The M metrics aren’t an accurate measure of the money supply. It isn’t very clear what money even is, as international banks have taken to using derivatives, treasuries, some securities as cash equivalents. The M metrics are wholly insufficient at determining the actual quantity, or how that quantity affects prices.

Labor costs can rise for a number of reasons. It is only inflationary when we reach full employment, which we are woefully short of right now. I imagine wages will come back down once the extra unemployment benefits expire, as businesses now have to have their wages compete with doing nothing.

PPI (producer price index) is actually not correlated with CPI very much. Breakdowns in supply chains and increasing transportation costs, which is underlying a lot of the producing costs right now, will be gone once/if production ramps back up and backlogs are cleared. It’s not the same thing as monetary inflation, where equal quantity goods are being bid up by more dollars. We just have less goods at the moment. 

My point about Japan is how banks interact with reserves. A pivotal step in the stimulus process of QE is that banks lend against these newfound reserves, which they are refusing to do in both Japan and the US. Inflation fear is nothing new, it has happened at least 4 times since I got burned: 2009, 2012, 2018, and now. This too shall pass, and interest rates will continue falling to 0.

I’m long bond prices, which means I’m short interest rates. 

The Fed has never been able to reach their inflation expectation targets, and the base effects of last year as well as the semiconductor shortage are chief contributors to the May CPI being high. Both of which are transitory.

Edit: I should clarify I do think we’ll see inflation, but we’ll see it right after deflation comes in and wipes everyone out and the government is forced to start monetizing the debt. Until that happens, sustained inflation is the Fed’s wet dream. It corresponds to a healthy and growing economy, and all I see is debt fueled asset bubbles, increasing government dependency and lawyering."
2021-06-14 18:55:58,stocks,"It's a good thing that Ray Dalio also falls in that category because he's been warning about inflation for a long time. Supply bottlenecks? We do have these, yes. Did I even mention them in the post? Don't think so. Way to go attacking a straw man 👍

Can you explain how pumping money into the economy is a supply bottleneck and doing the biggest stimulus in US history is not inflationary? How keeping rates artificially low is not inflationary? How rising house prices are not inflationary? We saw what happened in Feb when yield rates started jumping and the Fed had to put on a speaker twice a day to calm everyone down because people were concerning about inflation. We keep seeing it every single day om CNBC, FT, WSJ, Bloomber, Reuters, etc.: Inflation, inflation, Inflation.

P.s. Everyone keeps pointing to the 10YR yield as an indicator that inflation is transitory, but nobody points out the fact that the Fed is actively buying treasuries to keep yields low and that their overnight repo program is at an all time high because banks have so much cash on their hands that they can't handle it 👍"

You're right, the M2 Money Supply is not the best metric, but I think it is all we have at this point. Plus, the Fed conveniently changed the methodology in March / May 2020 if I remember correctly so it's not even comparable to previous years.

You're right about PPI and CPI although I don't think I've mentioned PPI. We'll see how that unfolds, too.

The interest rates are at 0% though - [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS) \- It is 0.06% right now. I think they are exceeding their inflation targets right now, but you're right, it's not one or two months, it needs to be sustained. Although if the Fed sees high inflation they will have to raise interest rates and if they raise interest rates, then all hell will break loose for the stock market and the Fed itself. There is obviously a spike in inflation right now though. Inflation hasn't been at 5% since 2008. That's a pretty big thing, although, again, yeah, it needs to be sustained I guess.

2021-06-14 10:31:13,stocks,"And I'm saying that I was only comparing the timespan, but you were still eager to suggest that I start reading more.

The GFC was caused by bad financial regulation first and foremost, overleveraging of banks, etc. This is obviously not present today. Like I said in my previous answer:

>The causes were different, obviously, but the results were similar. High unemployment, lots of extra government debt, lowering of interest rates, etc.

Doesn't matter what the causes were, what matters is how the government handled it and what happened after.

And still, **still**, despite all of the **deflationary** indicators in the wake of the GFC, we saw an inflation spike of **5%** lasting over 4-5-6 months. **The biggest in 20 years**. What was common between then and now though? Again, like I mentioned in my previous answer, we've got 2 main things:

1. Massive government spending (stimulus) - back then it was $700bln, a record high, now we've got... what... $2bln? More? 3 times the biggest bailout in US history? That is definitely a deflationary sign. I cannot see how this will affect inflation *at all*.
2. Lowering of interest rates - this time, they're at almost 0%, nowhere else to go

Combine that with other inflationary factors that were not present back in 2008 and we can see that a long-term higher-than-average inflation is possible. In case you misunderstood what I said again, I said that 2008 was DIFFERENT, but there are SIMILARITIES. And finally, I just gave it as an example for the TIMESPAN.

Hopefully that was clear enough 👍"

Who needs preorders a year after the vehicle is available?  Preorders are only required because there is no vehicle available to evaluate.  


The simple fact is that Burns was a horrible CEO and there is nothing in this report that is negative.

But honestly recently I've began to think that a few years ago that has started changing. There are groups that are purposefully weaponizing the anonymity and freedom of speech to spread misinformation and that positive to negative ratio is getting closer and closer to 1.

The positives still outweigh the negatives but some things definitely need to change to curb the spread of misinformation and group think."

2021-06-14 18:05:56,stocks,">Even see a fuckton of Teslas in Europe.



Europe is years ahead of USA when it comes to EV adaption and creating a charging network. Tesla was ""first to market"" with a good EV and thanks to massive government subsidiaries (see Norway) it was the most affordable. Yet these days it's not as smooth sailing. All charging stations/netowkr use the *open charging standard Tesla doesn't use* which means they got to build their own competing infrastructure in *every country*. Further more the price/quality comparison is not a favorable one for Tesla given the outright poor quality of modern model 3s. 




And last but not least the competition is *massive* you got stor ger cars, chepsrr cars and everything in between. Tesla used to dominate jut are now losing marketshare by the month as competitors steal their lunch. Though the biggest flaw is Tesla using proprietary charging tech, it means they withe rmust spend millions building their own network or realize customers won't use one car that won't work on ""every charger"""

I may trash Trumpers but I don't really ""fit in"" amongst the left either.

I would be a center-left moderate if America was rational politically.

I am focused on reality and have zero tribal instinct. That means BOTH political parties hate me as they prefer easily malleable tribal voters that will change their actual beliefs based on party affiliation.

I am a firm believer that parties should adopt the values of the base they represent, not tell that base how they should feel about a specific issue.

Then attack anyone that is not 100% on-board with whatever tribal political issue is popular.

Pro-gun, pro-free trade (globalist), pro-death penalty; social liberal with some conservative economic tilting.

I think the federal government can be of great benefit to the American people but I do want individual state's to retain their sense of identity and I genuinely don't understand why there can't be a middle ground there.

I'm not saying we're the same in all or even most of our political leanings, but I do believe there are many, many disenfranchised people right now feeling the same way. Hopefully it brings about change at some point."

It's the MASSIVE amount of importance they place on those differences that is the issue.

The reality is that much of the difference is perception, not truth. Like the left wanting to take away all the guns and cheeseburgers is simply untrue but is a solid rallying cry and has been for years.

Most of the right are not racists like the left makes them out to be.

I was not political in the oast and if it were not for the trump movement, would still be apolitical."

2021-06-14 14:47:20,stocks,"So I don't really understand option strike price. Let's say I'm super super super bullish like magically 100% sure a $20 stock is going to surge to $40 within half a year.

Would I just set the strike price low as possible and expiration for half a year from now? (obviously paying a higher premium but in this scenario I'm sure the stock will go up)? Or would setting the strike price higher (like $35 strike price) be more beneficial in this magical scenario?

I just don't see how low strike prices can be bad. If the stock falls, the lower strike price has a higher chance of still being beneficial. If the stock rises, the low strike price becomes more powerful if exercised. Are the premiums differences so large? Why wouldn't you always just set a low strike price?

Like I know that's not how it works; I'm just giving this scenario to illustrate my lack of understanding. Thank you for any explanations."

Is there any books or YouTube channels etc. you can recommend for a beginner ?

&#x200B;

I have been listening and reading on both reddit and YouTube, like example some Peter Lynch speeches. But I still feel ""unsteady"", I have manged to generate a small positive return but I feel unsure. I can do the most basic research, like do the company have a good income, does it have any debt, does it produce something that will still be used in the future etc. 

But I still lack how to read more on a specifik stock. I feel like my knowledge is still too basic.

Unlike that stretch where it looked fantastic in late March and April, you have more of it participating in the last month (it may have had its first advance/decline line ATH since mid-February today).

I stubbornly still don't think it'll happen until July though. Do admit I could be wrong, today was just another day that reminded me more of early November to mid-February.

But regardless, if this is correct, the analogue that fits here is 2019, but a bit faster. If you weren't around for that one (I was around for the first pullback, lol), it had a fantastic recovery off entering bear market territory in 2018 and then pretty much only bounced around a range for 6 months. Followed that up by then grinding up 20%+ over 4 and a half months, and then we know what happened.

Yeah, I know, COVID won't be a thing, but you could still wind up flirting with a bear market anyway for a different reason. Not a crash, but something like 2018."

2021-06-14 13:57:15,stocks,"With each day the market passes, I am being shown more and more not only how much it cycles around but how key it is to not buy anything without a really strong gameplan and outlook. 

2 months ago growth and small caps were being bludgeoned with a hammer. Now growth is slowly creeping back up, small caps are zooming again, and a lot of large cap stuff and value is flat or receding. One way or another, chasing with the trends just doesn't seem to be the way. 

I began to confide more and more into the things I truly want to follow but it still hurts to see how there were opportunities to break even on various things I wanted to let go in order to consolidate with just a bit more patience. Then again anti-survivorship bias could also be at work since it doesn't let me appreciate all the areas where moving my money proved advantageous. 

All in all though, accepting that the stock market is a glorified circus that makes no sense, quashing FOMO, and not letting noise cloud my goals really looks to be how I'll manage to stay the course going forward."
2021-06-14 13:57:30,stocks,"On another note, I'm thinking $MX is a decent play. Doesn't hurt to play it, especially when shares are still sub $26.

If the buyout goes through for Wise Road, $29 per share isn't a bad thing, at all.

If the NEW offer gets voted on, that's $35 per share... I don't think either one is something to complain about.

As for the regulatory issues, it's unlikely Korea will deem Magnachip technology to be ""national core technology"". Even if it is, that doesn't mean the government will block the deal. It shouldn't be a ""national security issue""."

2021-06-14 14:26:59,stocks,"$PRVB. Passed initial fda board vote 10-7 with concerns over side-effects/effectiveness in younger trials.

Only improving chances to pass FDA approval, especially considering they are trying to show that they are working towards cures for diseases without current cures this year. Approval vote is 7-2-21 and only expect the price to fluctuate upwards until then. 

Do your own DD but its my PERSONAL opinion that the stock is a great opportunity even without considering it’s possible position if it passes FDA. Just trying to bring attention to a good chance incase it doesnt hit the big movers tap for today even though its up 13.24% today."

2021-06-14 14:25:02,stocks,I recommended CRSR last Wednesday as an undervalued play when it was at $30. Didn't expect WSB to take over but tbh even in the 40's it has room to grow.
2021-06-14 15:03:22,stocks,"So you are buying a call option when the stock is at $20. And there is different strike prices.

If the stock price goes higher than the strike price you picked set (35 or 40), and you let it expire, you will purchase the stock at the strike price (35 or 40). You lose the premium either way.

Option is not always about ending with the stock (or selling the stock). Yes, the idea is that but the purpose of people buying and selling calls is not to end up with the stock, but to sell the contract before expiration at around 50% profit.

If we keep IV constant, if you buy a call option when the market price is at $20 at 35 strike price. And because is very out of the money. It might cost you $1 per contract. Now, lets say the market price increases to $25 in like a month. Your contract is now worth $20. Why? Because the closer the market price is to the strike price, the higher the premium.

Then you just sell the contract at $20 and you make $24. You dont need to wait for it to expire to make money with contracts. The same happens with puts.

Buying calls and puts, time is against you, so premium will decrease as it get closer to expiration, as long as we keep everything constant (which is beneficial when you are selling  calls or puts)."

One is timing. You may know warren buffet bought a stock within the last quarter, but you don’t know when exactly or what price, so that same stock still may not be as good of a buy 2 months later. 

Also consider scale and pace. Peter Lynch has written some good things on this subject. If you’re a retail investor and you’ve got $1000 to invest, you can buy anything and move quickly. 

If your Buffet, you’re more limited.  There’s not a lot of companies that just have, say, 1 billion dollars worth of stock available for him to purchase.

It's fallen through its technical support, with the 200 day MA sitting around 300 currently.  They could be on a collision course in that 310 range, in which case I'm adding heavily.  

I've had it happen a few times in the last couple months where I've set a price target only for the stock to bounce back at 5$/share more than that target.  I do think they're a really good long term hold, though."
2021-06-14 12:09:39,stocks,"I would say so, I bought at 37 before and the company is doing even better now. I would expect it to go to the 100s easily within 2 years, 3 years if it keeps trading like a value stock instead of a growth stock"

Clearly should have bulked that up to more shares, but live and learn.  Not sure it has sustained momentum to break the $100 mark or even hold there if it does.  Cannot see them riding like $NVDA did.

Microchip shortage has impacted AMD and has made the third party market for GPU's pretty massive.  Unfortunate result of that, AMD is not making money on the third party resales.  It appears Apple is fully turning away from dGPU's with their own chips, which also will impact AMD longterm.  If AMD eGPU can work with M1/M1X/MX chips, there is some promise for tapping into that customer base."

Weed is still mainly just a retail play. Their last quarter wasn't so great during a pandemic. Also, I would be careful with Canadian companies, since weed is not legal in the states yet. When it does get legalized, there is no idea how trade will work between countries and there's no idea how well they can even break into the US market, since there is already going to be a ton of domestic competition.

I think if you want to do weed stocks, ETF's are a better bet. That, or go after the pick axe play on them, the hydroponic market."

2021-06-14 13:18:34,stocks,"Very true, I am bullish long term but if I can snag profits then invest if it dips again win win situation and if it keeps going up then more for me and a new investment with its funds lol"
2021-06-14 13:23:05,stocks,This.  It can still run a little. Sell enough to not have FOMO if it drops but keep enough to not have FOMO if it keeps going

2021-06-14 12:42:39,stocks,"I think you discount the other things dkng does, such as fantasy.

And yeah, the us gambling market is small, but it's increasingly being legalized in more and more states. The reason its as small as it is is because sports gambling had been mostly illegal. It's gonna grow, and quickly.

2021-06-14 10:57:44,stocks,"If you think WSB has anything to do with any of these tickers, you're actually an ape. If WSB could move tickers, then BB would already be in the stratosphere and CLOV would be in the gutter. It's all pumps and dumps, it always has been. 

You can track a few different hedgefunds and see it in action. Personally I follow Citadel because I assume they have access to that sweet sweet Robinhood data.

In May they filed their updated 13F-HR/A. Guess who suddenly doubled their CLNE? Well, for me, it was then that I knew it was time to buy CLNE

Ever since GME it's been a good bet. A few hedgefunds up their holdings of ""wallstreetbet darlings,"" the price moves, a few male ""bossbabes"" start spamming wsb with tickers like their very own MLM campaign, the hedge funds up it even more and then FOMO sets in and then its time to cash out"

2021-06-14 10:15:37,stocks,"> Still undervalued and NO this is not a meme stock

Take a look at WSB daily and say that again.

Great company, absolutely, but this run is all meme."
2021-06-14 14:11:45,stocks,I mean that's fair. I just figured the news of it's largest competitor essentially out of the race for the foreseeable future would have moved the stock the other way.

2021-06-14 19:50:38,stocks,Thanks for the heads up. Please let me know 👍😊
2021-06-14 17:14:39,stocks,Could just be a pullback since it ran 40 to 55 in a month. I'll be buying more if it dips below 50
2021-06-14 09:19:19,stocks,2.2 volume and crsr has been pimped by wsb for months. doubt this is just wsb.
2021-06-14 09:10:45,stocks,Nah if you see what they do to other stocks the floor gets a pretty big rise. The floor on this before was 29 to 30.  I wouldnt be shocked to see this under 35 again but it's not going back to 30 imo. Just my 2 shares worth.
2021-06-14 10:53:06,stocks,There's still a large amount of developing nations without a vaccine. Still a big addressable market
2021-06-14 11:39:43,stocks,I'll just buy the dips. Neither are going anywhere and infrastructure of some form is coming
2021-06-14 07:57:45,stocks,I'm buying in as soon as market open. Yes it's a P&D but some those loons actually see the value in the company and it is undervalued.

2021-06-14 19:41:27,stocks,This is the correct answer
2021-06-14 11:22:47,stocks,So wait for the inevitable dip? I'm still new to options trading so I'm still feeling my way around with a lot of these things. This wouldn't be my only option in my portfolio but FOMO is a nightmare 😭
2021-06-14 10:14:25,stocks,The spike is on good new and it beat earnings as it always have. I love what they're doing with the business  and it seems like the stock has been killing it ever since I bought into it a while ago. I just wanted to know when it's time to let go of a stock. Is when the stock isn't performing that well or when there is better profit to be made? I'm just wondering.
2021-06-14 10:33:41,stocks,"Understood, I was looking at ratios and CP just blows all RR out of the water IMO.  BUT, where did you hear about CSX buying KSU?  I thought that CNI was buying KSU?...

But super excited for that CSX stock split happening and a CSX rail is right next to my place so I see the trains almost everyday go by (sentimental value).

Think I am going to consolidate into CSX as I am holding long term regardless for the train stocks"
2021-06-14 10:52:16,stocks,"CNI is buying KSU, not CSX. CSX is a southeast US line."
2021-06-14 11:09:17,stocks,"Yeah being from NJ - I am always seeing the CSX trains move across different lines constantly, I also just love trains so whenever I see a CSX train I get pumped up lol"
2021-06-14 11:08:30,stocks,"Love UNP, but CSX has the sentimental value due to having a line in my backyard basically.  UNP is legit though, but it already has the largest market cap for RRs - and it's ratios are lower than that of CSX or CP."

2021-06-14 14:11:48,stocks,"No freaking joke. Makes me more glad than ever that I agree with my advisors to make my Roth VTI/VXUS and DCA into it monthly.

Have learned a lot from tackling DIY investing on the side for myself but boy has it been an emotional rollercoaster up until now where I finally started coming to terms with this stuff. 

It hurts letting a lot of that stuff go and watching it rise back but this year's made me realize I'll probably be better off long term not trying to juggle as much crap since it just makes me that much more likely to make a dumb blunder."
2021-06-14 14:10:23,stocks,Even after this pump I'd still consider it a bit underpriced. They've been low key kicking ass. It was my current value play. I find it unlikely many people were shorting this stock.. But I guess I'll have to find another stock to start pumping money into.
2021-06-14 14:20:56,stocks,It took me a while to find a solid company that was undervalued in this market. Now I have to do it again sooner than I hoped.
2021-06-14 14:33:22,stocks,"I'm a truck guy and leaving the industry that requires me to have a hauling heavy one soon, so the Maverick has honestly looked really appealing. Feels like I'm a bit late on a lot of run up, but there's plenty of time for actual production to prove a new market foothold for them.

I guess I knew the answer but have been tempted by the weed stocks lately. Thanks for the insight."
2021-06-14 15:23:51,stocks,"Ford has had a hot hand and recent rise.  There's a school of thought that it's not properly valued and just applying an average multiple to earnings it should be closer to 18.  Sometimes such moves even overshoot, so I was waiting for it to get in the 17-19 range.  However in the recent week or so it faltered at $16 and is now under $15.   

If someone is a nimble enough trader there could be a move to catch here.  It feels like bad news like the production number cut has already been digested.  If there's to be any bad news in the form of quarterly sales announcements, those are a way off.  Presumably 2021 will see headlines anticipating the various new models, order backlogs, etc.

I can't make good predictions in the weed space.  I do know that when Canada legalized, the expectations were high and it turned out to be an utter bust up there.  

Unlike OP, I wouldn't want to commit to either industry for 5-7.  Need to pay closer attention to holdings and the economy than that."
2021-06-14 19:42:02,stocks,Lmao
2021-06-14 17:37:30,stocks,The banks are the primary forces trying to manipulate the bond market and market in general thinking they can force the feds hand into making a rate hike which they have failed to do every time in history because they are fucking idiots. Imagine being as rich as the guys running the banks and having no conscience about fucking over most of America with a recession so you can make more money. I’m so glad fin tech is going to make them go out of business FUCK traditional bankers I’m glad to see them die out
2021-06-14 16:39:39,stocks,"It's okay to trade for money. I made 70 bucks today getting in late to the party. Will close half in pm no matter what at 7am, ride the rest to bigger gains or else cut off at break even.

I want to be an investor, but the real money I've made this year was trading momentum plays. You lose some, win more. Go ahead and rule it out but I wouldn't recommend that."
2021-06-14 17:17:43,stocks,What make you not want to buy the stock?
2021-06-14 19:52:35,stocks,then you would be in the red. i prefer not being in the red.
2021-06-14 12:03:09,stocks,Jefferies maintained at buy with a $630 target (up from $560 where it currently sits).  That is why it is moving.
2021-06-14 11:49:29,stocks,"It just pumped straight up over last week. Look at one year graph.
No news but usually there is a correction after such a spike. Better to sell now and take profits."
2021-06-14 10:26:17,stocks,"Agreed - value is looking a little 'tired' right now, and if rates continue to drift lower I think they may have hit a wall for the foreseeable future."

2021-06-14 13:21:36,stocks,"Yeah it’s been on an unsustainable tear but looking at its valuation compared to something like WMT, it still seems pretty reasonable. Havent really looked into what the discrepancy is between those 2 historically but TGT is still way cheaper. Although that may say more about WMT’s than TGT’s"
2021-06-14 10:17:39,stocks,"Yeah I didn't realise my cost basis was so high around 37 or so. I wasn't happy I paid that price so took my profit and GTFOed

2021-06-14 13:28:43,stocks,Yeah I think I still have PTSD from January which is causing this. NET is a great company but I just have Vietnam flashbacks of daily 5/7% drops.
2021-06-14 14:38:00,stocks,That's a pretty big if. Trying to time the market is not possible and the catalyst for this today is mometum/volume. Everything will come down to reality at some point.
2021-06-14 11:14:09,stocks,"Agreed. Global warming is one of my biggest political issues, but there's also a reality to the situation."

2021-06-14 09:29:12,stocks,for sure sell buddy. been holding for a couple months.
2021-06-14 07:17:52,stocks,"FFS, I'm holding onto this one for the long term as they are a fantastic company but I just don't want any conversation around it to be spammed by ""APES STRONG"" ""HODL"""
2021-06-14 05:51:18,stocks,Me too brother - good luck to all CRSR holders!
2021-06-14 11:03:36,stocks,"Except that CRSR was specifically targeted by WSB last Friday. That's what prompted this, it's why I bought Friday AH and made a small profit this morning, as I specifically saw that WSB was making a play on CRSR. Regardless of what the hedge funds do, this wouldn't have started if WSB didn't start bringing up making a play on CRSR."
2021-06-14 10:33:29,stocks,I was confused for a moment I thought the share price was that of brk.a
2021-06-14 12:18:25,stocks,That's one strategy. Sometimes you actually want to lose your shares. I generally just sell CCs at strikes where I'd be perfectly ok with selling.
2021-06-14 06:44:25,stocks,"Probably that would be the smart thing to do, yes. Or set stop losses along the way as the pump continues and ride it up."
2021-06-14 07:02:55,stocks,Deoends how high it goes cause rn it's undervalued. But work with a stoploss I'd say
2021-06-14 12:11:21,stocks,May bounce off 30 day moving Average if not the next support line remains quite far
2021-06-14 12:20:19,stocks,I don't get it.
2021-06-14 14:56:54,stocks,I think it’s reasonable to start a position and DCA going forward.  Buy big if it dips big
2021-06-14 15:23:43,stocks,You can just put them on your list to see how they are moving. No need to buy. I keep Robinhood to see the charts at glance but don't have any money with them.
2021-06-14 17:22:37,stocks,And that is when I will buy in.
2021-06-14 16:53:09,stocks,"No worries. I mean generally stocks tend to tradeside ways until there is a catalyst. That could be like earnings, news, etc. It's been up the past month, 35%, so having a down day of like 2% is competely normal. 

OTLY is interesting because of they are valued at 13 Billion dollars. The next big catalyst for them will be their earnings report or any PR that might come out with new contracts. I've been eying the company, but waiting it out to see what happens."
2021-06-14 18:56:14,stocks,"Personally I thought it was/is over priced but I do think they haven't penetrated the non-dairy as much as they can, at least in the US. Last I seen they were only 15% of that market so they have room to expand.

2021-06-14 19:52:53,stocks,I will when I find it :)
2021-06-14 17:30:13,stocks,Makes sense. No news catalyst usually is like low volume mixed with just people selling from what I can tell.

Russia already gives away their vaccine."

2021-06-14 11:46:34,stocks,Buying options on meme stocks is a huge risk. Paper trade options for a while. You will make a ton of mistakes and will be glad you didn't do it with real money.
2021-06-14 10:22:50,stocks,"I mean it all depends on you tbh, and your investing strategy. For me I could keep it for the long term, as in 20-30 years, if I believed it was a stock that would keep going up. If I was worried about a performance drop and affecst to long term growth I would sell at the best time, ideally on a green day, but it's often something you can't time."
2021-06-14 10:46:33,stocks,"Oh right it is CNI, I remembered wrongly but still CSX is not too and and historically post stock splits result in a bump in market cap."
2021-06-14 14:19:25,stocks,"For me, I have two accounts outside of my 401K, another Roth IRA i rolled over and then a normal investing account. My normal investing account, I do more swing trading and do more momentum plays and try to beat the market. I only invest a small amount per month. I work from home and do software, so it's easy for me to be able to trade. I mean, there is some money to be made, just takes a lot of work and luck.

For the record I sold at a 40% profit this morning, and made 10k. So I honestly am not salty about the situation at all

I guarantee you that when their 13F-HR/As come out, all the typical hedgefunds are going to have a big ole slice of this pie because it's them that's pumping it. Look at CRSR's charts. They've been swinging it up and down for the last three months. It was bound to finally pop

This last week maybe they threw in a few extra bots, but it's been like this the whole time. A few CRSR posts every week or two, move the ticker up 20% in a week, and then if it doesn't catch bring it back down. Eventually the bossbabes at wsb reached a critical mass of FOMO."

Generally, you need to consider the tradeoffs between strike and premium. If you want downside protection, you would choose a lower strike. If you are bullish and just want some extra money, you would choose a higher strike.

There's a lot more to consider, but that's the basic idea."

While there’s no steadfast definition of what constitutes a meme stock, one common thread across the many names being pitched on social media is a focus on heavily shorted companies. Shares of Reddit icon GameStop Corp. jumped as much as 2,500% in January after day traders noticed its short interest had ballooned to record levels.

Investors looking for other stocks that might fit that mold will find nearly 230 firms with a market capitalization of at least $100 million and short interest of 15% or more, according to S3 Partners data compiled by Bloomberg. More than 80% of those names have managed positive returns over the last month with the average gain sitting at about 18%, while the S&P 500 Index rose 2.3%.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Questions from a younger investor I am a 28 yo, single w/no kids. I currently have approx. 6 months emergency fund in the bank. I have approx. $3k in crypto and $4k in my brokerage account. Before, during and now post-covid I have made literally almost no total gains. If I make $30 from a stock there is one I lost $30 from. I am a type of person who needs to sell a stock once it makes me $30-$40 and I am working very hard on making this trend stop because I know it is stupid.

I currently have 14 stocks in my brokerage account. After doing some research it seems like it may be best to just buy 5 or 6 stocks and just hold for the long term. My questions are this: Does this sound like a good idea? I do not want to invest in all of FAANG because I believe Netflix will trade sideways/down in the next few years. I also believe Facebook is going to underperform the next 2 years. I only would want Apple, Alphabet and Google. The other stocks I like are Tesla (currently own) and Square (currently own). If I had to pick one more stock it would be Berkshire Hathaway Class B. So my portfolio would go from owning 14 stocks to 6:

Apple, Alphabet, Google, Tesla, Square and Berkshire Hathaway Class B.

I feel like 6 is a good number, and maybe to sell my Square and buy a bunch of ASO stock instead, or tolerate owning a 7th stock? Thoughts? Apologies but I am somewhat new to investing (started right before COVID)."

2021-06-14 04:22:02,stocks,I feel like you need to diversify and also you should be gauging gains by % not by $
2021-06-14 04:41:12,stocks,"Stock picking is tough and takes an absolute load of time and expertise to do correctly.  There are bull and bear cases for every company and you could just as easily pick 6 underperforming stocks as 6 overperforming stocks.

I think you need to start from the beginning and define your goals and time frame.  Are you trying to make a quick increase or are you actually investing with retirement in mind?  If you're investing for retirement then your actions (selling after a small increase) is at odds with your goal.  You then need to develop a personal strategy based around your goals and then stick to that strategy.

If you're investing long term, then then answer is almost certainly to put most of your money in broad market ETFs and add monthly, and let it compound until you retire.  Even with this strategy there is considerable medium term risk, so make sure you understand that a $4,000 investment today could be worth $3,500 or less in 5 years time.  

For the stocks you've mentioned, the real question is why exactly do you think they'll outperform?  If you can't give a really detailed answer that addresses both the upside and the downside of the futures of those companies then you should consider staying away from stock picking.  Only invest in the number of companies that you can keep up with to this level of detail - you should probably be putting in at least an hour a week keeping up with each company to refine your opinion of them.

Or, if you don't want to do any of that, just acknowledge that what you're doing is more akin to gambling than investing.  There's nothing wrong with that - but you need to be honest with yourself about it."
2021-06-14 06:52:04,stocks,Just go long term with a single highly diversified ETF. But first repay debt and try avoiding whenever possible except for housing.

Also Google and alphabet are the same thing"
2021-06-14 04:48:29,stocks,Absolute first step is to stop selling. Especially crypto. If youre selling every 30-40 dollar gain you are trading not investing and have very low odds of making good money with no experience.

2021-06-14 04:33:47,stocks,"do you want to be a day trader or an investor?

buy quality companies that you keep yourself informed on, that you see a bright long future for, and plan to hold for decades. to do that effectively you should have a small-ish number of them. 

that or a broad index fund where you invest in the total market and just set it on autopilot. 

your 6 picks don't seem bad per se, I hold most of them. but I would add an equal amount to VTI or VT so you don't have all your eggs in the same 6 baskets.

Those guys on CNBC are giving Cheese Whiz as finance advice and sell it as news. Truth is that nobody knows what might be the best strategy because there is always uncertainty for everyone in the market and if they do they don’t tell anyone if they still buying into a position. I’ve seen the interview as well and to me it looks like someone bought fire insurance while noticing that someone left the stove on. Some people have seen it as well and priced it already in.

So here is a good lesson about the market, it's forward looking. It's about investing in what is going to happen, not what has happened and this is especially true in Semiconductors. Those unfamiliar with the space are likely to jump in at all the wrong times.

The shortage is nothing new and investors have been piling into this trade for months! 

So what's happening now?

Well now you have more and more semiconductor factories being able to operate at higher and higher capacity as the pandemic winds down across the globe. 

You have the U.S. passing funding of $53 billion dollars to onshore production of Semiconductors. 

You have one of the largest markets, crypto, decreasing in value, and the second largest crypto asset, Ethereum, on the verge of moving away from mining all together. 

Also companies haven't been able to capitalize on the market in the way you'd want. Although a shortage can raise prices higher, it's different then a demand spike.

They weren't able to produce as much, which means they weren't able to move a higher amount of volume at a higher price. 

Thus being able to produce more then fixes the supply issue, lowers the price, and then they are able to move more product, but at a lower price. 

So the ideal time to get into the Semiconductor trade was right when the shortage started to happen. When it looked like nobody was going to be buying a car or a PC and all the production was slowing down, basically when it looked like a terrible time to buy.

Now you have a decreasing of demand, or atleast a leveling out, matched with an increasing ability for companies to meet that demand.

Thus although they will finally be moving more volume, it'll be at a lower price. 

Semiconductors is an industry that traps a lot of people. The worst time to invest usually ends up being the best, and the what looks like the best ends up being the worst. 

So if you're wondering why they aren't going up now?

*TLDR:*

Investors already bid up the price of the companies in anticipation for a shortage and are now leaving the trade in anticipation of an increase of supply in the market."
2021-06-14 02:15:39,stocks,"Shortage is not result of increased demand (ok, there is some demand increase), mostly there is shortage because of supply chain issues and production fallout. If they don’t have the products they can not sell it."
2021-06-14 11:08:28,stocks,"Simply, they likely projected to sell those chips “anyways”. Say they have 100,000 pieces of inventory to be sold. Before, they thought they’d sell them over 2.5 years. Now, they will sell them over 4-5 years, maybe even at a slightly higher price. But, the NPV of those cash flows may be equal or even in favour of getting the chips out the door at a faster pace/lower price."
2021-06-14 05:44:36,stocks,Very simple. Production capacity. Many were already close to maximum production. So there has been an increase in pricing for a lot of the semi-c stocks but unless they can produce more it’s not going to fly like you suggest it should.
2021-06-14 10:46:03,stocks,Semi’s are cyclical.   Markets are forward looking.  Any shortages means countries are heavily investing in semi’s to increase supply.  Depending on how long you think the semi shortage will last is an opportunity to buy or sell.  All the semis are trading at higher historical multiples.
2021-06-14 03:57:23,stocks,Demand has not gone up. Supply has gone down. Meaning they can’t even meet the demand they have. That is not a good thing.

2021-06-14 03:28:50,stocks,"If there’s a shortage that causes a drop in revenue, why would it go up? Demand is not so inelastic that these companies can command whatever price they want so they are selling less resulting in lower revenue?"
2021-06-14 10:58:18,stocks,"If the company cannot scale to demand, then they won't grab all the profits.

If you can only make 25 hot dogs per day and there is demand for 100,000 hot dogs for just this summer, are you going to invest $200,000 to meet this demand, then be stuck with 100 hot dog carts in the fall?

People are also taking profits. What happens once demand smooths out? Stock prices might drop since there is no source for infinite scaling.

Your logic makes sense in a closed environment, but you're not recognizing all the other factors that happen after the demand for chips drops."

2021-06-14 18:24:01,stocks,This was a very thoughtful and methodical post. It gives a good flow for how to look forward when you invest so that you get in early. Is there anything that you think is good to get into now (i.e. has to pay off later)?
2021-06-14 04:08:47,stocks,Doesn't really answer OP's question does it though? Increased demand is the same thing as reduced supply with regards to the supply-demand curve.
2021-06-14 12:48:29,stocks,"Semiconductors are just components and in components back orders aren't necessarily a good thing. They are to an extent, but not this much. 

With component industries, one companies backorder is another companies opportunity. It's a chance for them to supply relatively the same product faster, and possibly cheaper.

So this forces companies to increase the cost of production in order to clear out back orders and keep customers from leaving. 

Sure it's an industry wide issue, but it's an opportunity to gain future market share, so it becomes a race to provide for customers and gain market share. 

This causes the cost of revenue to go way up and the entire industry to end up over supplying which ends up leading the eventual down cycle.

Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, because they are a commodity. 

I know they get lumped in with tech, but an investor can't think of them as tech, they trade much more like a commodity.

I also know that because of the boom in PC gaming and the build your own PC market pockets of the industry have become more consumer facing than ever before, which as led novice investors to believe they are more than commodities. But this portion of the industry is relatively small and most Semiconductors and the products that use them it makes no difference to the consumer what brand is used. 

Also worth noting AMDs popularity really took off from essentially being able to supply the same product as Intel, just cheaper, and that just emphasizes the commodity aspect of this industry, even the consumer facing side.

Now long term, the industry continues to consolidate during down trends and the long term demand continues to rise. So there has been a trend of every cycle being higher highs and lower lows, I expect that to continue, but nonetheless it's still very cyclical, and I don't see that changing yet."
2021-06-14 04:55:26,stocks,"Not exactly.

A reduced supply also means an inability for you to meet demand, which means that you aren't able to move as much product as you could.

I know there's a theory side to supply and demand, but it rarely plays out. 

In reality there are long term agreements, contracts, customer loyalty, and brand reputation to name a few reasons why the price doesn't necessarily reflect the supply/demand relationship.

Where as a high demand environment would mean more customers, newer agreements, more contracts locking in future sales, and so on, that would allow them to sell even more product. Even at a lower price it'd be an environment they could capitalize on capturing a higher percentage of the demand.

But what's important to keep in mind is that the price never will raise to exact level to equate an inability to supply during a supply shortage, for reasons stated above. It'll go up, certainly, but not proportionately or else there wouldn't be a shortage and there would be plenty of semiconductors on the market, there would just be customers priced out of them. 

Instead it ends up being a capital intensive process of restarting factories, hiring staff, and building new facilities in order to increase supply. 

So not only are you making less in proportion to demand, but you're going to have to spend more in order to keep customers and insure future sales, or risk losing out to other competitors who move ahead of you. 

And you're doing all this during a period in which demand isn't necessarily any higher. Which means there will still be a down turn in demand and you'll be left over producing and over supplying the market. 

So you're spending all that money just to sell a normal amount of product at what will end up being lower prices. 

But the trade off is someone else in the industry does that too you, gains market share, and then when demand does pick up you're left not being able to capitalize.

In theory supply and demand is neat and orderly, but it never plays out that way in reality."
2021-06-14 05:05:58,stocks,"Hmm knowing how dependant modern industry is on semiconductors, saying ""there would just be customers priced out of them"" is like saying people would stop drinking water if prices doubled. You don't really have an option do you"
2021-06-14 05:28:47,stocks,"They may be important, but nonetheless they are basically a commodity. 

Much of a companies success in Semiconductors has to do with business management, forming relationships, and being a reliable trading partner.

Plenty of commodities are important, but it doesn't create a scenario where anyone one producer is necessarily more valuable because of it, nor does it make the producers more valuable by themselves.

It actually attracts competition to an industry where there isn't a lot of room for a competitive advantage. 

But if a product is selling out that means the price isn't high enough, and semiconductors are selling out instantly. And that price will never rise to the level that would stop that scenario from happening during a supply crunch like this, for reasons I explain earlier.

But yes, smaller customers would be priced out by larger companies. Everyone has a budget and no matter how much they need something, that doesn't mean they can afford it."
2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Does a stock being overvalued matter if buying long-term? I am wanting to build up a long-term portfolio and am doing as much reading as I can in fundamental analysis, diversification etc but one thing sticks out to me. If a company is significantly overvalued now but you believe the company will continue to thrive long term, does that reduce it's priority in your porfolio at all or is the current price totally irrelevant with DCA?

&#x200B;

I imagine the answers will be close to my thoughts which are ""a little bit"". Idea 1 is to sit on more cash and wait for doomsday and finally buy in at a reasonable price, but in the meanwhile you have underutilized cash. or you DCA day 1 and whatever happens happens.

&#x200B;

An example of what I'm looking at is Nvidia. Fairly confident in the long term prospects but by all accounts it is MASSIVELY overpriced by the research I could do (or find, realistically)."
2021-06-14 03:17:34,stocks,"Yes, but not as much as you may think.

Two examples come to mind.

One is where you could've invested in Microsoft at the peak of the Dotcom bubble in 2000 and still returned 9% a year and beat the index.

Walmart was way overvalued in the 70's but returned something like 13% a year since then.

Two things they had in common? They both have long periods of vastly underperforming the index. They both turned out to be incredibly good businesses and that never changed.

It's hard to find a business that good, and it's hard to keep faith in a business being that good after 5 or worse 10 years of under performance.

That's why people like valuations, you don't need to pick the next great company over the next 30 years and remain confident in it when everything else looks better. 

Buying a great company and staying invested is a lot harder than it sounds.

It also had lead a lot of people holding on to GE way to long and riding GM into bankruptcy.

Seems obvious in hindsight, but telling the difference between Microsoft being a market beating investment and GE being a money losing investment would have been an impossible decision in the late 90's."

2021-06-14 03:05:12,stocks,"The first difference is your return. If you pay $1.50 for $1 of actual value, it doesn't matter what your time horizon is. Your returns will be lower.

The second problem is margin of safety. If you buy a company that is overvalued, there is no margin for things to go any other way than excellent. Is it possible for this to happen over, say, a 10-year time horizon? Yes. Is it likely? No."
2021-06-14 03:10:16,stocks,"The entire question is based in the assumption that ""being overvalued"" is some sort of objective truth. That ain't so, so the thought experiment makes no sense. If you think a company is promising and is going to increase more than the general market then it is not overvalued from the start."
2021-06-14 02:07:36,stocks,"It all boils down to your conviction in the company and whether it’s “walked the talk” previously. When you’re buying an overvalued company at the moment, you’re doing it with the premise that the company has a lot to offer down the line and is posed for good stable revenue growth in the future and will also continue to expand across businesses. Ask yourself if that’s what the company is posed towards. Valuations now will be an entirely different numeric 10-15 years down the line. Buy into the business and its prospects, let the price just be background noise."
2021-06-14 05:03:12,stocks,"If you buy a wonderful company at its top price of the year, and then hold it for three decades as it continues to grow and flourish, it really won’t matter if you over paid a bit.

But thats usually not the way the world works, the reason value investors like to wait for a company to go on sale is less about increasing profits and much more about preventing losses.

If I’m wrong about a company and its future prospects**but** I bought it for half its fair value I’m probably still fine.

Ask yourself this question: If I deployed 1/3rd of my investable money into Nvidia on Monday, and on Tuesday its price fell by half, would I sell for half price? or would I buy twice as much.

This isn’t about blind trust in the market or diamond hands or any of that, its about how well you understand what you’re investing in, and how strong your conviction in that understanding is."

For point 2, it’s impossible to know an exact number. But if the company is going to be disruptive and make waves it’s a lot more likely to be higher.

Is the company going to do anything that will cause massive increases in revenue? Is the company going to corner a market or suddenly find a new revenue stream which will make money rain down from the sky?

Those are the things I focus on."

2.) I can’t time the market. If I like a company and believe in it for the next 10-years, then it won’t matter anyway. Would I like it cheaper? Of course, but no sense in trying to time the market. 

3.) personally, I buy stocks that I think are going to be 5x - 10x 10 years from now. If that is your lens, then just buy now."

If it's over valued and you imagine it will continue growing long term, then I suppose the issue is that in short term there might be a fall and then a recovery. The key point is then the time it takes for the fall and recovery back to purchase price(DCA or otherwise) vs the opportunity cost. If the recovery back is quick then likely not much opportunity cost lost. If the recovery is very slow then there will be much opportunity cost involved. The fall and recovery will likely be based on how much is the share overvalued by, conditions surrounding the fall, and what the business does in recovery. Given that there doesn't seem to be one size fits all answer to the questions and you will need to judge it case by case."

People love to point out that you could randomly pick any time in Amazon's history and they would have been considered overvalued at that time, but Amazon is the exception not the rule.

Part of the problem in doing so is defining what counts as ""overvalued."""
2021-06-14 11:19:10,stocks,"Let's say your company gains 1000% from fair value to fair value over 20 years to a certain price. Buying it at 0.75, 1, 1.25 x 'value' would give you different results:

0.75 - 1000 \*  1.3 = 1300% return

1 - 1000% return

1.25 - 1000 \* 0.8 = 800% return. 

But an investor should be satisfied with any good return. It depends on how much you trust the company to perform well. 100% certainly of a good return is better than 90% certainty of a greater return."

People have preferred metrics, calculations, valuation models etc. to try and estimate value, but they are inherently uncertain. A DCF, for example, requires you to estimate revenue growth, etc. 

This is frankly why DCA became recommended in the first place. If you buy one share a week for three years, you won’t have lucked into the bargain basement price, but you also won’t have accidentally blown your load at the peak."

So yes, valuation matters almost above all else…this is true for ETFs as well as individual companies.

2021-06-14 05:25:44,stocks,I used to work at the bank and ppl like u always made me laugh because we actually HAVE to speak the language that came with the call. You most likely have landed on an agent who is bilingual and it probably wasn't a busy day in his/she queue. If a call came in French u best believe I will be speaking French to you only. There is a language queue for a reason. Also a lot of these agents are not bilingual. They are doing the language queue only.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"""Time In The Market"" vs. ""Its OK to take profits"" Obviously these popular contradictory statements are thrown around quite a lot. I've been investing in some blue chip stocks like AAPL that seem to go nowhere. I bought Apple at 125.00 last August and in hindsight it seems like it would have been to good to sell it on Jan 25 @ 145.00, but I've been subscribing to the mindsight of ""time in the market"" trumps ""timing the market"".

SO how do you guys know when to sell and whether it makes sense to just hold and look at it in 5 years?

PS. I've also heard people talk about selling before earnings and buying the dip. Haven't tried this but is this a good practice?"
2021-06-13 23:59:32,stocks,"Time in the the market...means exactly that. Not 'time in a stock beats timing a stock'

This applies more toward index funds. With regards to stocks it's obviously more complex. It depends on your strategy, risk tolerance, goals and expectations for the underlying company."
2021-06-14 00:02:18,stocks,"Time in the market and time in a stock are not the same. What’s your price target for AAPL? That’s the price at which you say “this stock seems a bit overpriced and is therefore a good opportunity to sell and find another underpriced stock.” It’s an investment because you like the company and are comfortable owning it because it will pay dividends and you’re reasonably confident the stock price will rise to your target. Whether it takes 10 years or 10 weeks, once it hits that target, you can sell. 

This just happened to me with ANAT. It shot up 25% in like a single day a month ago, to what was my price target. I would have been happy to own ANAT for years but by a fluke of the market I didn’t have to. I sold and bought new positions. My time in the market is the same, my allocations are different."
2021-06-14 04:26:52,stocks,"there's a difference with ""time in the market"" and ""hold a stock to the grave"". yes you should take profits every now and then. you should do that to rebalance and grow your portfolio."

a) dont want to own a stock for whatever reason (change of strategie, something fundamentally changed, outlook into the future changed etc.)

b) if I believe a stock is overvalued for the current price"
2021-06-14 01:20:19,stocks,"At least to me, time in market means long enough time, everything goes up. Inflation and more efficient society allows stocks to rise. 

Taking profits is more about people who fear losing out.

For example I got tesla stock, waited 2 years and sold when it doubled. Within the next few months, it soared. 

I'm not upset I sold, I could have made 400 percent instead I made 100 percent. That tesla money went into other companies I felt weren't as over valued."

2021-06-14 05:47:32,stocks,"Ive bought some around 20% of all time low and I’m keeping them until they pay dividends, because I think that’s when they stop growing. For some I just sell 25% of stock after 300% profit then more as it goes up."

IMO I think apple is done with increasing profits by crazy amounts."
2021-06-14 11:00:10,stocks,"I subscribe to the mindset of never selling stocks unless rebalancing. Apple is a huge performer in my portfolio, but at 40% holdings after the last couple years I can't stay completely in Apple. On a good day for them, I'll often sell to rebalance back to 20% and be happy with it.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"HMPT LDI 2 unloved stocks with PE ratios under 4. Great earnings reports, record sales. Down a lot after RKT report, 2nd Look? Happy Sunday everyone. Hope everyone had an amazing weekend. A few weeks ago I highlighted the sector which also included RKT and UWMC. These 2 mortgage plays have recovered 25+% since then. It is my belief that these 2, RKT, UWMC was helped by the MEME craze. Both tickers were very popular early on. Unfortunately, the beginning of last month RKT missed earnings by a penny and all 4 of these in unison made 52 week or all time lows at the same time. A company like HMPT which was under 1% short is now near 10%. LDI is now near 25%!!! It is very wild because all 4 make tons of money and have had great earnings reports.

Let us first take a look at HMPT. The current market cap stands at near 900 million. The stock price trades at 6.53. The last report they beat by 31 cents and came out 1.06 per share beating the 75 cent consensus. 2 quarters ago they came in at 1.22 beating the 1.20. Before that it just IPOed. There sales have gone from 130 million in 2018 to 1.3 billion by end of 2020. They went from a loss to making money. They are expected to earn between 2.50-2.65 on the year! 

LDI actually had a special dividend of 200 million which is 62 cents a share. They also will give a regular dividend spending roughly 100 million...giving to shareholders. It is valued at 4.3 billion and trades at 13.99. There first report as a publicly traded company was outstanding with a 42 cent beat coming in at 98 cents. They are expected to make close to 4 a share!!! There revenue has gone from 980 million in 2018 to 4.1 billion!!! 

I understand these are new to the market. Have some debt as they are new issuance and growing fast. However the recent cash flows will far outpace all debt requirements. I would expect LDI and HMPT to recover like UWMC and RKT. 25%+ since they crashed. RKT was 16.20 and UWMC was 6.25 all made all time lows within 48 hours!

Thoughts? Thank you."
2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week: Oracle, Adobe, Kroger While bulls continue to lead the markets forward, investor focus will likely shift to macro indicators, such as interest rates and inflation, as the Federal Reserve begins its two-day meeting this week.

Although the central bank is unlikely to make any moves on rates, it could provide some insights into how it sees the economic rebound progressing and whether the need to remove some monetary stimulus has indeed arrived.  

So far, stocks investors don’t see any danger to their favorable views on the market. The S&P 500 finished on Friday at a new high, posting a 0.4% gain for the week. Keeping this macro picture in mind, following are three stocks we'll be monitoring in the coming week.

1. Oracle
Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) will release its fiscal 2021, fourth-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, June 15, after the market close. Analysts are projecting $1.31 a share profit on sales of $11.02 billion.

The shares of the software company are surging this year on improving demand for the tech giant’s cloud computing services after years of stagnant sales. Its stock closed on Friday at $82.90 after climbing 28% this year, more than three times the return produced by the benchmark NASDAQ 100 Index.


Growth prospects are improving as the company focuses on cloud computing services in an effort to accelerate revenue growth at the world’s second-largest software maker. Customer interest in the firm’s internet-based applications has finally offset declining demand for its legacy tools.


2. Adobe Systems
Another stock that will come under investor scrutiny this coming week is Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE). The software manufacturer, whose product lineup includes Photoshop, will release its fiscal 2021, second quarter earnings on Thursday, June 17 after the close. Wall Street expects $2.81 EPS and $3.73 billion of revenue.


Adobe’s earnings during the pandemic showed that the software maker’s cloud-based creative tools are in great demand. Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen has offered new creative software tools to clients to accelerate Adobe’s revenue growth. 

In March, the company raised its 2021 fiscal year revenue forecast to $15.45 billion from $15.15 billion and said sales in its main digital media segment would increase 22% after earlier projecting 19% growth. Adjusted earnings will be about $11.85 a share, an increase from $11.20 previously forecast.

The company introduced a version of its popular app—Illustrator—for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad, back in October, as part of an effort to expand its products' footprint to include more devices used by professionals and hobbyists.

Consumers of Document Cloud products—including Adobe Acrobat PDF and electronic signature software—have surged with millions working from home.  Adobe shares closed on Friday at $541.26 after rising 8% this year.

3. Kroger
Supermarket behemoth, Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) will report its Q1, 2021 earnings on Thursday before the market opens. Analysts are expecting $0.98 a share profit on sales of $39.56 billion.

Kroger's stock has gained 22% this year on the grocer’s surging sales and its participation in the U.S. vaccination campaign against COVID-19. The company is delivering millions of vaccinations to people nationwide, creating more repeat customers for its pharmacies and supermarket offerings. Kroger generated record sales of $132.5 billion in the year ended Jan. 30.

Kroger is betting that its in-store pharmacies and clinics can keep its supermarkets central to consumers’ lives even as the coronavirus recedes. Next week’s earnings could provide some insight to investors regarding the path it intends to take once the pandemic is contained.

“COVID has taught us that pharmacy is always really important and will be important as we go forward,” Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s chief executive, told WSJ.com in March."

2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Amazon details new warehouse robots, ‘Ernie’ and ‘Bert’. Amazon warehouse workers could soon be joined by a couple new co-workers: Ernie and Bert.

Those are the names of the new robots Amazon is testing with the goal of reducing strenuous movements for workers.

While the introduction of robots to the workplace often raises questions about whether human jobs will be replaced, Amazon argues they simply allow workers to focus on tasks that most need their attention while minimizing their potential for injury. Amazon said it’s added over a million jobs around the world since it began using robotics in its facilities in 2012.

In May, Amazon announced a goal of reducing recordable incident rates by 50% by 2025. It plans to invest over $300 million into safety projects this year.

Amazon described in a blog post Sunday four robots it’s testing to move items across its fulfillment centers and closer to workers.

Ernie helps remove items from a robotic shelf so employees don’t have to. The process doesn’t save time, Amazon said in the post, but testing has so far indicated it could make work safer for employees.

Bert is one of Amazon’s first Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), made to navigate facilities independently, even while workers are moving around. Unlike other robots, Bert would not need to remain in a restricted space, meaning workers could ask it to take items across a facility. Amazon said Bert could eventually move heavier items.

Companies like Amazon and billionaires like Buffett / Bezos /Zuckerberg champion large wage increases that will bankrupt small and medium-sized companies that already have razor thin margins.

Billionaires and companies like Amazon are proponents of increasing regulation and tax schemes which they know will negatively impact small businesses, who can't afford the teams of lawyers required to find loopholes and minimize taxation.

The argument against rich people “not paying their fair share” is that they apparently have a net worth in the billions but don’t seem to contribute that much in taxes. The problem is that people don’t get that CEO compensation/net worth is primarily in stocks. Asking someone to be taxed on their net worth is like asking you to be taxed based on the value of you plus your home vs. based on salary. 

Companies like Amazon pay taxes— but then they get rebates for R&D expenses because the government wants to stimulate innovation (and why shouldn’t they? Amazon is innovative). They also carry forward losses to lower the tax burden, which is something every business owner in America can do. This is how they effectively “don’t pay taxes”.

2021-06-14 14:51:13,stocks,"You need to look up Norbert’s gambit for your currency conversion.

It works like this:
You buy DLR (on the TSX) in CAD.
Transfer the shares from your CAD account to your USD account.
You sell as DLR.U (on the TSX), proceeds are in USD.

This will allow you to do the currency conversion without paying the 2-3% your bank or broker is charging you.  The only fee is the trading fee (just like any other stock transaction).  Your broker may require that you hold DLR until the trade settles before being able to sell it."
2021-06-14 18:13:23,stocks,How do I sell as DLR.U? I dont even see the option to do that with my broker. Usually when I buy something I cant sell it as something else
2021-06-14 18:50:55,stocks,"Sorry, I think it might be DLR-U, but may depend on your broker.

Here are the steps I follow:
1. Buy DLR in my CAD account
2. Transfer to USD account
3.  Enter a sell order for DLR-U.  Note that it does not show as DLR-U in my account, but I can enter a sell order for DLR-U and have it go through.  I learned this by calling the broker.

Another option you have is to by a stock that is listed on both the TSX and NYSE.  Take TD as an example, say 500 shares.
1.  Buy 500 TD on the TSX in your CAD account.
2. Journal the shares to the NYSE listing in your USD account.  You own 500 shares regardless on the currency.
3.  Sell your TD shares on the NYSE.  Proceeds are in USD.

The downside with the TD (or other stocks) is the volatility.  Your broker may make you hold the shares before you journal them and the trade could go against you before you can make the sale (it could also move in your favour too).
Some brokers will do this for you on the phone (journal and sell) without waiting for the trade to settle.  Best bet is to make a call and ask how you can execute Norbert’s gambit.  Most are familiar with it since it is a fairly common strategy to avoid large currency transaction fees."

2021-06-13 23:06:49,stocks,"VSEQX is a small and midcap fund. 

So if you're looking to keep that, but add diversification then you will want to add a U.S. Large Cap Fund, and a extra U.S. equity fund.

VTI wouldn't make sense because VSEQX already gives you exposure to small and Midcap stocks, and that is the difference between VTI and VOO. 

VOO works if you want an ETF, or VFIAX if you want the mutual fund. Sometimes mutual funds can be better because you can set up recurring purchases and buy fractional shares.akes it super easy to automate your investing.

VEU (ETF) or VFWAX (mutual fund), give you exposure to non U.S. stocks."

It's innately more diversified than picking one stock, but being all stock and just one instrument means the real risk is twofold:

First, the entire market could tank, taking everything in the fund down and losing all the gains.

Second, the fund could fail in some way, due to mismanagement or legal problems.

Splitting this money up into more than one find reduces the latter, and shifting some to something other than equities would help with the former."

Mutual funds can fail. It doesn't happen often, but it's a risk that's easy to reduce by getting part of the money to another fund.

If you're already effectively diversified by having significant money in a house or cash then you're good, but if that fund is 99% of your assets it's a case-study waiting to happen."

Then when you leave the job you roll it over into an IRA, and start a new 401k at your new job.

These shares are probably in a taxable account. At your tax bracket now, the tax rate will be low if you sell some of it. Maybe lower than you'll pay in retirement. But probably not lower than if you wait til a year after the basis date (the day it transferred to you, check the paperwork) and it becomes a long-term holding.

2021-06-14 10:00:50,stocks,"Your friend is delusional.. that makes no sense.

I've used wealth simple for 4 years. It holds my RRSP and IRA, while my 401k sits in fidelity due to reasons I have no complaints about wealth simple. Using their robo advisors is how I started to learn about the stock market. Would recommend"
2021-06-14 13:11:32,stocks,"Your friend is wrong, as it is illegal for Wealthsimple to basically steal your money secretly like that. I'm pretty sure Wealthsimple makes most of their money from conversion fees and premium subscriptions. Most people will reccomend you only buy Canadian stocks with it, but I buy anything and I really don't mind the 1.5% conversion fee when buying US stocks."
2021-06-13 21:46:36,stocks,Your friend is mistaken. You pay like $0.15/100 shares. That's the fee market makers pay wealthsimple so that they route your orders to them. So its definitely orders of magnitude cheaper than using TD or even CIBC. Only downside is no fundamentals or options or even many tickers but whatever it's free right. The ultimate broker for canadians is interactive brokers tho. Basically no commissions and all the features you could want
2021-06-13 20:42:55,stocks,"Emphasis on Canadian stocks and I'm pretty sure Canada doesn't have a PDT, pretty sure that rule is American. 

If OP is looking to purchase stocks not listed in CAD, Questrade would be the better option. Charging the exchange fee for a buy/sell everytime would be more than paying a 9.95 fee."

I’m new to this whole thing and that still eludes me.

2021-06-14 11:53:37,stocks,"It depends on the size of his porfolio. I have small position sizes and use wealthsimple for american holdings because the 1.5% fee is less than $9.95. Plan to switch to Questrade once my account gets bigger.

2021-06-13 23:14:00,stocks,This is awful. On a 10k usd trade buy you're paying 12200 and on the sell getting back 11900 for a 300$ loss. Norberts gambit on dlr is like 40$ fees back and forth at any of the big 5 and like 20-25$ at questrade.
2021-06-14 12:07:01,stocks,But you can't hold USD in Wealth simple so you're paying it again to exchange back to CAD as soon as you sell. In Questrade you can settle the transaction in USD and pay an exchange fee once.

2021-06-13 23:19:06,stocks,"Except you pay the big 5 fee on Canadian trades too where as WS Is 100% free for those. I’m Canadian so it suits me better then any other broker.

It all depends what market you prefer to trade in"
2021-06-14 12:59:54,stocks,Yeah but you pay a commission fee on the sell too right? So its either 1.5% or $9.95 per transaction. In my case 1.5% is less than 9.95. Like I said I have a smaller portfolio and am still building it out. Once 9.95 becomes less than 1.5% I plan to move all my US holdings into Questrade.
2021-06-14 10:47:32,stocks,"I actually can't..

I'm in the US and wealth simple is transferring all its accounts to betterment here. That exchange is happening today, so it's the 1 day where we are all unable to touch our accounts.

Timing lol."
2021-06-13 23:21:55,stocks,If you only trade in CAD it's fine but us market is where the money is at and ws isn't a viable option since they're scraping 1.5% each transaction
2021-06-14 13:25:16,stocks,So your portfolio is less than $663? 1.5% on $663 is $9.95 which is what a lot of the big 5 banks charge for commission per buy/sell.
2021-06-14 13:28:54,stocks,My postions typically are less than $663. I also like to add in stages as opposed to trying to time it perfectly.
2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Thoughts on Treasuries? It seems the market has quickly transitioned from being worried about inflation to being worried about deflation. As a result treasury yields are falling causing bond ETFs to trend upward. What are everyone’s thoughts on investing in bonds right now, how long do you expect this trend to continue, and what indicators do you expect to predict a trend reversal."
2021-06-13 20:30:37,stocks,It's impossible for anyone to accurately predict interest rates (and therefore bond prices). What we do know is that low yields = low reward and high risk. The ONLY option in my opinion is to buy Treasury Inflation Protection Securities (TIPS). While the yield is low (all safe bonds have low yields now) it provides some protection from deflation and a great deal of protection from runaway inflation. Many portfolio would benefit from having a small percentage invested in TIPS because they have a low correlation with many other investments typically in a portfolio. Here is more information on TIPS and how they function: https://www.arborinvestmentplanner.com/treasury-inflation-protected-securities-tips-benefits-buy/
2021-06-13 20:32:58,stocks,"I’ve had calls on TLT since mid-May. People are still bought into the reflation narrative, once CPI cools off rates will come back down.

But I’m invested on a bet the economy turns to shit this year. We’re really better off than we were in 2019, when rates were last this high? Yeah rights. Supply chain and transportation are getting backlogged, oils through the roof, labor force participation is getting worse. Rent and eviction moratoriums coming to an end, as well as extra unemployment dropping.

Plus the Fed has made it clear they will only act as a janitor if things turns sour. They haven’t even tried to explain why the circumstances that lead to QE6 came about."
2021-06-14 10:24:01,stocks,The insurance that TIPS provide against inflation is not free. Essentially you are paying a premium to bet that inflation will exceed market expectations (I predict the opposite). TIPS usually underperform treasuries for that reason and tend to be more volatile during financial crises. They are overpriced right now as indicated by the [TIPS 10 year yield spread](https://ycharts.com/indicators/10_year_tipstreasury_breakeven_rate) and I believe TIPS funds will see a strong correction as deflation gets priced in.
2021-06-14 07:49:02,stocks,"Which one was QE6?

The circumstances for Fed buying up paper have been obvious since March 2020: Coronavirus depression prevention, and until January an administration with a thumb up its ass.

Most of that would be unwinding now, if the public hadn't preemptively sold off bonds and raised yields from August to January."
2021-06-13 20:21:05,stocks,"I appreciate your take. I should say I expect inflation for things like housing and vehicles to continue with the price surges of materials such as lumber and steel. However, the pandemic accelerated the acceptance of technologies which have the potential to reduce prices of staples. Even if deflation is a distant concern, it seems like it is being priced in now, or maybe, inflation fears are being priced out."
2021-06-14 11:44:59,stocks,"I agree that if you believe strongly that deflation is coming you would favor long term Treasuries over TIPS. I believe any coming deflation will be very short lived because the Federal Government will do everything they can to stop it. I""m not saying that is good, I just believe the long term odds are for inflation over deflation. However, like I said, it's impossible for anyone to accurately predict and therefore we have to make asset allocation decisions that reflect that uncertainty. Good discussion!"
2021-06-14 09:28:05,stocks,"The QE that started in March was the 6th iteration done by the US Fed, despite what they might claim.

The Fed buys paper to prop up the treasury market after a mass sell off occurs. Why did the mass sell off happen, and how can it be prevented in the future? Your guess is as good as mine, but the Fed has published nothing to that effect.

> Most of that would be unwinding now, if the public hadn't preemptively sold off bonds and raised yields from August to January.

I don’t agree with the reasoning, but that aside, you think the failures of the Fed are because of the public? What?"
2021-06-13 20:26:39,stocks,"Deflation will come eventually but I wouldn't worry about it, I expect commodities to continue their run through this year, as for housing I believe we are in the middle of a forming bubble, if the fed fails ro raise rates and keeps them too low for too long then we have another bubble on our hands. I don't really understand your point ""the pandemic accelerated the acceptance of technologies which have the potential to reduce prices of staples"" so if you could clarify what you ment by that?"
2021-06-14 13:24:05,stocks,Well-said. I'll consider allocating toward them in the future.
2021-06-14 09:43:16,stocks,"The public sold bonds for several months starting 8/20. This caused a rise in bond yields. Some sellers even shorted bonds.

The likely reason for this was the growing certainty that vaccines would be ending the pandemic lockdowns and the Fed would be unwinding its balance sheet, cratering bond valuations. Non-Fed owners got out ahead of that.

The Fed, meanwhile, stopped panic-buying in July and in August started a slower, consistent acquisition program that has not stopped or varied pace since then. It's probable this shift in strategy catalyzed the public perception that the buying could become selling at any time.

So whatever you're calling QE6 didn't happen this year, it happened last year and is still ongoing and the reasons it started were obvious, it's just not obvious why it's still happening."
2021-06-13 21:35:01,stocks,"Simply put, technology improvements lower production/delivery costs which in turn lower the cost of goods. That’s the theory at least."
2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Opinions on ASO (Academy Sports & Outdoors Inc) YTD it is one of the best performing stocks in 2021 ($21.19  01/04/21 and on $41.71  06/11/2021). 

Not to sound like a rookie in investing, been investing since 2017 in individual stocks - but it is one of the very few times I have seen a stock be doing so good YTD, and still being shown as ""undervalued"" by Yahoo Finance. To add to this, Yahoo Finance shows them short/mid term continuing to go upward. 

If I was to venture as accurate of a guess as I could, I would say this stock come 11/01/2021 will be easily able to supersede $60. I may poor $4k into it and let it ride until beginning of November, may hold longer. 

Seems like a hidden gem tbh, gives me vibes of Chipotle years ago."
2021-06-13 20:28:29,stocks,"maybe the best way to get a perspective on ASO is to look at SPWH. which was acquired by America outdoors group. for 785  mil.

SPWH total assets 706 mil, Total liabilities 492 giving it a book value of 214 mil. P/Book 3.7x 

SPWH revenue 1,532 mil. net income 103 mil. price paid was 0.51 x revenue and P/E. 7.6

SPWH 3y revenue growth rate 21.49, 3y net income growth rate 72.7, ROIC 20.74% 

ASO market cap 3.841B

ASO total assets 4,384 mil, Total liabilities 3,272 mil giving it a book value of 1,112 mil. P/Book 3.9x

ASO revenue 6,113 mil. net income 497 mil. P/S 0.64 and P/E 7.88

ASO 3y revenue growth rate 5.57, 3y net income growth rate 76.82, ROIC 17%

&#x200B;

It looks like ASO is fully valued at the moment, though not over valued. If ASO continues to grow as it has in the past shares will appreciate along with the company. The 5y P/E average for SPWH was 12 so the market could value ASO even more than it currently is."

i know it's a lot and it's pretty basic. even referrals to links would be appreciated."
2021-06-13 22:03:58,stocks,Probably not.. some of us just need the market to show us how wrong we are in thinking we know what's going to happen next. Unfortunately it can be a very expensive lesson

Do not stick your head int he sand. Avoiding forums and sites because some people give bad advice is not smart. Do read it all but just remind yourself not to believe it all. 

Treat analysts and fund managers the same you treat Reddit posters, they are just as idiotic despite their profession and the suit they wear. Dont take their credential seriously nor should you believe their performance if they boast. 

Read, listen, learn, and analyze things yourself to find out what is true and what isnt."
2021-06-14 12:13:04,stocks,"It all depends on your personal circumstance and risk tolerance.

If you earning enough income and can afford to be in the red for a while, then you can risk big. (if you looking for massive gains, going all in on one stock is the way, but it risky).

If you want to get around 10% a year on average, go for etfs.

But whatever your circumstance, keep cash aside as the real massive losses occur if you ever forced to sell quickly when market is down.

In short, make sure you have a decent cash savings before investing. Either way you choose how to invest."

2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"ETN question This might sound like a stupid question to some, but my knowlage on ETN's isn't the best. Take a look at Microsofts stock, (I would post a picture if it was allowed here) it literally only goes up. 

Microsoft seems like an incredibly safe bet. So my question is basically, why doesn't everyone just buy Bull ETN's with gearing to increase their returns? I know ETN's are more risky, and volatility is your enemy, but microsoft isn't very volatile at all. Scrolling throught some Bull ETN's on microsoft It seems like you would make money on almost any time frame. More money than just buying the stock."
2021-06-13 20:41:43,stocks,"I mean I totally get that a stock like microsoft could fall in the future. But you're not supposed to hold ETN's for years either. ETN's are generally shorter term (depending on the gearing). Lets say you buy 3x Bull on microsoft and hold for 3ish months each trade. And continue to do this. Most times you will make a profit no? Take this stock as an example: [https://gyazo.com/326215e5121936c487015fc5ee6fe18b](https://gyazo.com/326215e5121936c487015fc5ee6fe18b)

This is the 6month chart. If you look at the ""all time"" chart it looks even better, but anyways. Looking at that chart, if you had to bet money on it going up or down the next 2 months, wouldn't you bet it would go up? And I know you could be really unlucky and it could crash, but lets say you follow this strat every 2 months on super safe stocks like the one in the example. Over time you will make profit wont you? I mean, I know it sounds stupid to buy a stock because it only goes up, but based on trends an probabilities, everything suggests the price of that stock will continue to point upwards. Atleast with a shorter timeframe like 2 months. 

I also know the stock market is really bloated right now which will perhaps increase the risk, but I'm talking generally here. I'm trying to figure out if a strategy like this could be viable in the long term. 

Heres an example of the stock in mention. 

Holding the underlying stock itself for 3 months would give you ca 15% return. 

[https://gyazo.com/54d4a9956de99ea58620fa4de2cafe4a](https://gyazo.com/54d4a9956de99ea58620fa4de2cafe4a) 

Holding a 3X Bull ETN instead for 3 months would give you a 55% return. 

[https://gyazo.com/2bdabe09a4c969ca6499bedd73a6d4fd](https://gyazo.com/2bdabe09a4c969ca6499bedd73a6d4fd) 

The company in mention is in finance, safe, and has minor volatility. Im looking at the 3 month chart here, but it really doesn't matter which timeframe you choose, it will still give profits. Thing is, ETN's are considered extremely risky because of how volatility effects it, but buy buying safe stocks, or even better, indexes like s&p 500, that volatility risk is reduced alot. And guys like buffet always goes on about how buying safe indexes is the way to go, but why not gear that sh\*t up 3x times to net yourself more profits?"
2021-06-13 20:51:01,stocks,"I can see you've put a lot of thought into this and I can see how that makes a lot of sense.  From an odds perspective it makes a lot of sense. Realistically there are only a few times this could go bad on you over the last 10 yrs.  But I would point out almost all of these have come in the last 3 yrs - there's been one big index drop a yr since 2018.  

This could make it a very high probability bet, but this isn't really the same as a ""Safe bet"".  It's a pretty risky bet in that if there was to be some kind of shock being in an ETN could give you more exposure and being in a stock that was highest performing could have the sharpest pullback.  

In general I think the markets have gotten a bit too rich and I also have some concerns about how [ETFs and ETNs may pose some broad market risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeatTheBear/comments/nwbn81/do_etfs_pose_systematic_risk_research_paper/).  I may be overly cautious. And I do agree if you'd done this in the past it would have worked out really well.

2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Retail investors left holding the bag when the stock market crashes The poor retail investor ends up holding the bag when there is a stock market crash. Although there is misleading news by media and other sources, shouldn’t the retail investor do his own independent research extensively? After all it is his money he’s putting at risk... with all this inflation, asset prices rising and rates inevitably due to rise, how can the retail investor not suspect something is going on..? Investing at this top seems insane.

It’s like feeling bad for someone who’s heavily in debt but the minute he pays off his car he goes back to the dealership to buy another brand new one, back into the never ending cycle of debt of financially illiterate people. Who is to blame? The media, analysts, the fed, or individuals themselves. I think all. What do you feel and will the stock market be fine or trend down from now?"

Because there's a good chance that the market, as overvalued as it is, with all the risks that come from rising interest rates, will just keep on rising as it has been, and you'll be the one losing money from your shorts and puts when you try to time everything.

Sure, one can just not touch the stock market at all. But good luck dealing with the rising inflation everyone is so afraid of. Maybe you'll be able to buy some good bonds if the Feds do raise interest rates. Until then, good luck.

Maybe you shouldn’t have bought then either. Look at a stock chart from the last 20 years. You could have bought at any of the all time highs and still come out ahead. The market has gone nowhere but up except for short periods for decades. If you think there will never be an all time high higher than today, you should never invest and get off this sub."
2021-06-14 01:13:46,stocks,"Because crashes don't last forever, and if they do, you probably have bigger things to worry about than your brokerage account.

Everyone can hedge against downturns, and many do, the issue is that it's extremely difficult to accurately know when a crash will happen. Any money you spend hedging against a crash is money that isn't making you more profits now. However, it doesn't hurt to have some means to hedge against downturns. Options provide a good way to do this. However, often you need to more use stategies that limit loss in case of a downward drop rather than those that profit from a downward drop as that only generally works if you have a very good idea of when the drop will occur (ideally within a month) and how much the drop will be. If you know that, then something like [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/option-finder.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/option-finder.html) tells you exactly what put option or bullish spread to buy to maximize gains from the drop (naked calls are generally a very bad idea for most). Of course, if you are wrong, then you'll lose money, how much depends on how far the price drops. You can also simply close out positions you think will drop, but again, that's there's a cost there too, the opportunity cost of not having those positions.

Really for the vast majority of long term investors, the goal is to ensure that you have the means to take advantage of any massive dip in price and buy at the discount, the prices generally go back up unless there is something fundamentally wrong with the company that has been revealed by the crash. There are plenty of recommendations online for how to buy the dip of crashes to gain from the recover, most of them related to using some percentage of your cash to buy more as the price drops in certain percentage intervals."

You can’t predict the future. You can’t time the market. And this vapid unintelligent “oh it’s the elites that control everything” mindset is internet gobblygook. Will the market crash? Pullback? Trade flat? Not even the elites can say for sure. So you ranting like chicken little that the sky is falling is worthless to everyone.

Stay away from meme stocks, stick to efts, invest on a schedule, don’t try and time the market. If you need the money, reduce your risk, go with bonds, CDs, high interest savings. But you get nowhere by trying to guess when the next crash will be."

2021-06-14 01:20:14,stocks,"Perhaps but the point above remains, what you should do is directly tied to how far in advance you can predict the drop, if you can at all. The next crash is always coming, because there will always be a next crash.

The more prices continue to go up before the drop, the more it makes sense to hold or buy your current positions. The sooner the drop occurs, the more it makes sense to buy OTM put options. However, put options work best if you have a good idea of how far the price will drop and by when. Otherwise, you may lose money even if you are right, simply by timing it wrong."
2021-06-14 01:23:03,stocks,I would either buy on the money puts (married puts) or short the stock. Options are great to hedge with. Many people don’t know this. A lot of people just let there position crash or sell.

If things are looking like they might go down too hard, a negative delta spread can be added to offset things in the near term, while the short term call options are either closed or rolled."
2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Banks being seriously challenged on Comex. Huge rise in open interest last 3 days! 
On the Comex open interest rises when the price rises and falls when the price drops. Banks are the sellers when new buyers enter. This causes open interest to rise. The banks have been very quick to follow any price rises with sell offs to force out new buyers. The selloffs lower open interest as the stopped out longs sell to banks covering shorts.

 When the squeeze first started open interest was 173 thousand. It rose 10 thousand to 183 thousand before the criminal banks slammed the price. As price of silver was pushed down to $24 the banks engineered a drop in open interest to 150 thousand. Dropping open interest means banks are reducing their short position. Open interest has been rising as the price of silver has risen back to $28


Over the last three days open interest on the Comex has risen dramatically by 13,900 contracts. That's almost 70 million ounces. Banks have seriously added to their short positions as they fight the battle over $28 silver. Open interest is now at 198,791 contracts. This is over 15,000 contracts more than the high before the the February criminal smash!  The last three days weren't typical up days that cause open interest to rise!

Wednesday rallied overnight before silver was pushed down all day. Thursday silver was sold hard into the CPI release after which it rose with banks fighting every penny! Again Friday it rose overnight and was pushed down all day. Banks seem desperate to push silver below $28.

The macro backdrop is becoming increasingly bullish for silver. Real interest rates are becoming increasingly negative. This seems to be giving the hedge funds some testicles in terms of their willingness to challenge the banks. The macro back drop also increases physical demand from wealthy investors as well as sovereigns like China. 

Next week we get PPI on Tuesday and Fed day on Wednesday. Even the government lies about PPI are likely to be very bullish for silver though that wouldn't stop banks from selling anyways! The Fed is trapped and can't fight the inflation horror show with rising interest rates without collapsing the stock market. Maybe a mini stock sell off before the Fed says just kidding in order to shake off some silver longs?  Pressure is building on the banks! At some point banks will be forced to cry uncle and then price explodes. Could it be next week?

1. Yes selling them will trigger a taxable event, namely capital gains taxes.
   1. If you had them for over 1 year, then its long term capital gains.
   2. Otherwise its short term capital gains
2. If you have no income, the 1st $40k of long term capital gains have 0% tax. $80k if married. After that its 15% which is not bad anyway.
3. Diversification is always good for new investors.

All that said, given that no one can predict the markets and you need a place to live, probably better to sell them especially if you know you have no other income coming.

Priority #1 however should be to get a job immediately. The service industry is dying for workers right now and most pay $15/hr entry. This is honest, productive and honorable work. Dont let people make you feel small for taking a labor or low wage job if that is an issue. Those people are low lives and classless twits who probably had their lives handed to them in a silver platter. Take most any job you can and upgrade over time.

Every year in our town the price of wheat fluctuates wildly, if the harvest is good the price falls, if its bad the price soars, and its hard for people to plan next years expenses.

Farmers want to know before they plant how much they’ll make per bushel of wheat, and bakers want to know in advance how expensive the ingredients for the flour will be.

Our farmer can operate comfortably at $10 a bushel, and our baker cannot afford to stay in business if the price of wheat rises above $12 a bushel.

The farmer sells the baker a contract that gives the baker the right, but not the obligation, to buy the wheat at $10.

The farmer makes some money from the baker upfront on the contract. (This is the premium you make on a covered call)

If the price of wheat is **below** $10 at harvest, the baker would not exercise his contract, and would pay the cheaper marker price for wheat, he lost some money on the worthless contract BUT it served as insurance while it lasted.

If the price if wheat is **above** $10 the baker would exercise his contract and buy at a discount, the farmer lost out on potential gains from the high price BUT the premium he got for the contract reduces this loss, and he is confortable selling at the price anyways.

**This last part is key** because you’re the farmer in this scenario, I never sell a covered call at a price below what I’d happily sell for. Instead of holding a stock from $5 to $10 and selling, instead you sell covered calls at $10 and get your $10+ a premium if it hits that number, or you keep your stock and your premium if it doesn’t and you do it again until it rises.

If the stock never rises, the premiums you make from covered calls effectively lower your cost basis and generate profits that you otherwise would not have by simply holding a stagnant stock.

The reason I called this risk free is as follows

People will tell you that you lose if the contract is exercised because you could have sold higher, and I’m telling you that you probably would not have. Don’t use these to gamble, find a price and time frame that you would consider the stock overpriced at. Say I have a stock at $27, if it runs to $40 by January I would sell because I don’t think enough could happen in that time to justify that price.

Well if thats true then you would miss out on any profits after that point anyway so those aren’t real losses. Replace your limit sell with a covered call and enjoy the exact same profit on the sale if you hit that price, plus the call premium."

2021-06-13 21:51:12,stocks,"Yes, but before that happens, you can ""buy to close"" the contract.  Usually, i do that and immediately sell another at a higher strike and sometimes for a later date. That way, I don't lose my shares and continue to make money from them."
2021-06-14 04:18:44,stocks,"How do you fix it so that you make more money “selling to open” than you pay “buying to close”? Is it if the stock price goes down you make money by essentially shorting it? Also, when you sell a call, do you sell with net debit or net credit?"
2021-06-14 09:44:43,stocks,"Don't short anything.  You buy to close and sell another to open. The farther out you sell a call, the more expensive it is because of intristic/ time value. So if you buy to close one that you sold for June  and sell another to open for July or September, you should collect a premium again."
2021-06-14 09:52:47,stocks,"It can be very confusing. Lurk in r/thetagang. Also look it up on investopedia and perform a paper trade. Write down an actual sell to open call. Watch it, if the strike gets too close, buy to close and sell another further out and/or up."

I would short GME and AMC, but I have no idea when they will correct, and also am aware that their stock prices are not driven by fundamentals. I could be paying for months in premiums before I have a shot at any return.

So here's my friendly advice, as someone paying a lot of attention to GME.  FFS do not try to predict the downfall and think you can profit off of it by shorting. Yes you could get it right and get to brag about it later.  Or it could go very very very wrong for you. Extremely risky move. Do what above said, and/ or spend some time looking around trying to predict what small or mid cap stock you like could hit next and buy some of that before it runs. Join the circus. 

Understandable if you don't want to buy into GME at the current valuation. But that doesn't mean you are obligated to take the opposite side of that trade."

2021-06-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Hostess Brands (TWNK): Follow-Up to my Long Thesis Posted in February DD ***TL;DR:*** ***Short interest has only increased to \~20%, 3-month average daily volume has only decreased to \~1.3mm shares per day (would take shorts 17 days to cover), and it's Pride Month (Twinks are gay men with boyish qualities) so we're social justice heroes if we buy (can't wait for the news to explain Twinkies). I believe the stock is structurally short because of Environmental, Social, Governance limitations by smart money, which only leaves a great buying opportunity for retail investors.***

My prior post from February 2021: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lafmq2/long\_thesis\_on\_hostess\_brands\_twnk\_owner\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lafmq2/long_thesis_on_hostess_brands_twnk_owner_of/)

What's up! In light of Pride Month and the recent posts on TWNK, I figured I would provide a quick update from my old post on the name. I continue to be excited, and long, holding common stock, warrants, and August call options.

**> Short Interest**: Has only **increased** from 15% in February to 20% Today

\> **Average Daily Volume**: Has only **decreased** from 1.4mm shares per day in February to 1.3mm shares per day Today (based on 3-month average volume). However, over the last 10 days average daily volume has spiked to 2.9mm shares.

**> Thoughts on Short Thesis:** I think the high short interest is driven by Environmental / Social / Governance issues, which are all the rage these days and every credible financial institution now has these limitations when investing. TWNK sells ""unhealthy foods"", which is probably what drives institutions to short the name, and also to *not buy* the name (thus the stock price could be artificially depressed). This may be a great opportunity for us, where these political factors, not fundamentals, are influencing the stock price. Given WSB is not bound by this, there may be upside here for us retail investors.

**> Thoughts on Meme-ability:** It's Pride Month, and a Twink, for those who don't know ""is usually considered a homosexual male with attractive, boyish qualities. Typically from the ages of 18-25, and often thought as a young, white, fashionable male."" Buying TWNK is also supporting Pride Month.

**> Thoughts on TWNK Moon Potential:** TWNK received  a little traction in the last week (search TWNK on Reddit), and the stock jumped as high as \~8% on Wednesday (June 9th). There is such little volume that a bit of traction on Reddit can really move the stock."

Not looking for TA, just the symbol and a brief explanation of why you are bullish.

My #1 pick that I have not pulled the trigger on is $ASML. Reason I'm bullish is they basically have a monopoly on the equipment necessary to manufacture semiconductors and we all know about the chip shortage at this point.

Also looking at $CAT because the whole reopening of the economy in the post COVID environment where I see upgrading existing infrastructure/creating more will be in much higher demand than it was throughout 2020. And you typically need a quality bulldozer or two to pull that off.

I've been pretty heavily researching bio-printing technologies (3D printing skin and bones and other organs). It's a technology I was fascinated by 10 years ago when I heard about it on NPR, and now the tech is finally coming to the commercial markets. 

I expect it will take a little while, but CLLKF is poised to make a big break. They provide printers and proprietary processes to tons of major research universities and have a contract to provide bio-printed skin to health and beauty companies like Johnson and Johnson. They're sitting on a jillion patents and you can literally get your own natural bones 3D printed in San Diego RIGHT NOW for a bone graft in your jaw. 

Those who know, seem to think the sector is going to grow a lot in the next few years. 
CFMS looks like another wise choice in that space, and MTLS is positioning themselves to be a main provider of the machinery and hydrogels necessary when bio-printing becomes a really common procedure.

Airlines: United and Delta have come back pretty well. Again, still room. American Airlines?

Hotels: I believe the larger hotel chains got some serious help from the government. Any good buys here?

Cruiselines: Carnival? Norwegian? Royal Caribbean is already pretty high at almost $100 per share. 

Would love to hear what everyone’s thoughts are on these industries."
2021-06-13 20:22:29,stocks,Cruises are a bad investment right now due to all the dilution.
2021-06-13 21:09:38,stocks,"Airlines are still a gamble since they make their money from business travelers and they have not really come back.    Price is still below pre-covid by a decent amount.

Hotels doing good, for some chains still a worry because of business travelers.  Major ones are already above pre-covid price, so skipping.

Cruiselines.  I love cruise stocks, made abunch of money last year from buying/selling the bounces.  When the bouncing stopped I purchased alot more for the post-covid jump.  I sold all of mine already because people are STUPID.  There is no way these stocks should this high, cruises are still having issues getting started, they diluted and got millions in loans and then they sold lots of ships so the overall profit will be lower."
2021-06-13 23:15:18,stocks,"Airlines shares are definitely on the pricier side at the moment with I think most hugging their highs. While that might lead to some short term floundering or crabbing, the future is looking pretty bright across the board from the ULCCs to the legacies. At the bleakest point, I think people were ambulance chasing AAL. In an ideal world, I think the play is companies such as Textron (TXT) who manufacture private jets that will really eat the market share of business travel. Alternatively, Frontier (ULCC) or Spirit (SAVE) might have the most upward potential as people want to travel while on a tighter budget and solely to vacation destinations.

Lastly, I think Air Lease (AL) could also be a partial and last ditch reopening play as national carriers around the globe look to bounce back in the new order of air travel as different countries reopening at different rates."
2021-06-14 06:08:18,stocks,"Yep I agree. Cruise is over valued right now.

Airlines are back to old levels too so not much upside there either but thanks for the 100% gain. 

Hotels are all over the place so it depends on which one you are talking about."
2021-06-14 01:25:37,stocks,"I agree. I can’t believe how high the cruise lines are given how much they’ve spent to stay afloat the past 15 years.

It isn’t that business revenue won’t be improving in the next year, it’s that investors have already priced the stock so high pre-recovery."

Since it wouldn't do anything with the order at all, no internal record was made of me making the order, so I had no leg to stand on when I talked to support. They just treated me like some crazy Karen.

Luckily(?) I was able to sell it later for something like $150 profit. If the order had gone through when I got the error it would have been over $7000 profit.

I don't use ETrade anymore. I would love if you didn't either."
2021-06-13 20:44:59,stocks,"I use Etrade and I personally do not have a problem with them. The platform is very reliable, over the course of many years, there are only few instances where it was a bit slow to load. I hold long term so this really does not matter for me, to day traders it might be a problem (but again, it's very rare to have this occur from my experience).

Customer support is a hit or miss. Emailing questions is crap in my opinion. Usually if it's something important, I give them a call and I usually do not have that long of a wait time and I get excellent service, to my standard. Sometimes you have to wait very long, which I do not appreciate

Their mobile app is crap, would not recommend lol. Crap as in UI is wonky, everything is confusing, I can only see so little things at a given time. Stick to desktop."
2021-06-13 21:02:16,stocks,Etrade's customer service is literally the worst I've ever witnessed. For such a large platform you can never get ahold of anybody. After 4 different attempts and 30+ minute wait times in the past 5 months I moved my accounts.
2021-06-13 21:13:25,stocks,I had my IRA with Etrade years ago. Got a letter that they were going to start charging me fees just to have my IRA there and I GTFO. Moved to Ameritrade and have been happy ever since.

And mainly due to time it took to respond or their lack of communication clarity. All issues I’ve had have been resolved. Perhaps it has something to do with my location or setup, but side by side with TOS (which I also recommend) Etrade’s trading platform and app had faster real-time prices than TOS"

2021-06-14 02:26:01,stocks,Etrade and TD Ameritrade are part of the lawsuit with robinhood and they are all responsible for doing shady shit to their customer base  they protect their investors and not their clients!

2021-06-14 03:26:40,stocks,"Glad to see this. Just seeing their adds occasionally reminds me I’m not alone on there despite it never being mentioned in broker discussions. I think ended up on E*TRADE cause i like that E probably stands for electronic which I like. I use electrons to handle all my trades! Seriously tho, I think I’m their target demographic, old millennials and gen X. 

I always imagined we were the quietest users. Boomers always, pros and rh all touting something. I don’t think E*TRADE stands out for anything except good marketing 10 years ago, first one being born on the internet? and being all around generally acceptable. Customer service is fine etc

Edit: Now that I think about it; that really is their story. Before E*TRADE banks were named after combining old people’s names and regions. Now they’re going for niches and branding. But E*TRADEs differentiation is outdated now. They’re literally “hey look, we’re on the web!”"
2021-06-14 03:52:05,stocks,"For people complaining about the fee, something to add to the discussion, is when something is free, you are the product. Hence they sell your trades to a market maker or hedge fund, not sure which. When you pay for it, you're paying for the service and then don't need to use your trades to make money off you in that way.

That's my understanding, but maybe I'm wrong and they both make you pay for it and sell your trades..."
2021-06-14 04:11:52,stocks,"Because E-Trade uses PFOF just like RH. 

Fidelity is one of the largest asset manages in the world. E-Trade is ten times smaller. Plus phone customer support they have is great.

Vanguard has great index low cost funds as well. Also a lot of AUM, IIRC almost double of fidelity.

All of their apps are bad, so might as well go with whales."
2021-06-14 04:56:27,stocks,"Why select just 1? Use them all for what they offer. I keep accounts with 4 brokers. Here is what I recommend:

**International Stocks** \- Interactive Brokers (nothing even comes close)

**Long Term Margin Account** \- Interactive Brokers (best margin rates)

**Day Trading** \- Fidelity (fastest execution in my experience)

**Research Tools** \- GuruFocus (not a broker but just great visualization of data but its not free). Runner Up: Interactive Brokers (due to international stock data)

**Friendliest Website** \- ETrade (By a big margin and I recommend it to new investors)

I have a RH account too just as a tribute for what they did but I have to say its probably the weakest of the bunch at pretty much everything. Still I want them to hang around. I cannot overstate how wonderful their contribution has been. None of us would have free trades without them."
2021-06-14 05:15:12,stocks,"Forget about UI. Pretend your broker doesn't have a UI or app at all, you have to get the prices from yahoo finance. What's left? Judge on those things. Will you get paid?

Trading stocks isn't an app, it's a financial service."
2021-06-14 05:49:33,stocks,So what I’m seeing from this thread is essentially that Robinhood has the lowest fees of any brokerage?
2021-06-14 06:12:25,stocks,"At the risk of sounding as one wanting an argument I prefer E\*TRADE.  Why? I have been with them for about 5 or 6 years. To start with the gave me $1500 to move my account from E. Jones the fist go around and last month another $500 to move more. The bank was giving me basically nothing. I have never had a fee from E\*TRADE with hundreds and hundreds of trades including OTC, self directed account.  I'm thinking maybe their fee policy may have something to do with the account balance but that's just a thought. Phone service is lousy but my rep is always ready with an answer within minutes via email. Hope this helps. Best."

Yes, I use etrade. I don’t particularly like it and will probably make a change soon. The UI is clunky, the options tools look slick but actually suck. Power Etrade and Etrade Pro are buggy as hell. But you wouldn’t know any of that because you don’t have a fucking clue what you’re doing."

>RH was a late entrant into the field and benefitted from having a modern infrastructure.

This is the reason.

RH's UX would be just as shitty as everyone else's if they'd started with the same frameworks.

And if the other brokers do decide to update, they won't shut off their old interfaces, they'll just give you the option to use the new one. TD Ameritrade had three full-blown desktop web interfaces before Schwab bought them. They didn't change a thing. Why? Because users who aren't complaining don't cost anything, and users who are complaining can try the new thing. If they tell all the users to change how they find data and move their money, it'd cost way more than the development costs."

2021-06-14 00:56:44,stocks,Yep. Worked for a large company that tried to improve their e-commerce UI from mid 2000s and it still has not been done.  Acquiring RH for a couple billion seems like an easier task.
2021-06-14 01:15:26,stocks,"For that project, it was a front end web app written in angular. But to display the charts I was just using an HTML Canvas element to display graphics which can be programmatically controlled by Javascript. No framework needed for that. All I did with Canvas was use the line function to draw lines from each datapoint to the next and display values being moused over. 

The code is literally just looping through the data points,  normalizing them as percentages so they can fit any size chart, maybe applying some filters (eg low pass or moving average) to smooth the curves if the data is really volatile (was the case with Megawatt load data), and then just drawing a line from one value to the next. 

Call that function as often as you want and you have real time data. This could be done in any web framework or anything that allows you to plot lines based on coordinates. Since you normalize the data nothing stops you from allowing deep zooms, and if you have a decent api you could be retrieving data many times a second to get good detail so zooming in continues to gives more information. 

I would often assign sliders to the variables in my normalization and low pass filters so I could see visually how these changes affect the data in real-time as I edit the values and that really helped to learn how digital signal processing methods affect charting.

Also, I'd bet there are a thousand libraries that would accept time series data and display charts with different settings without any of this low level line drawing business. But either way it's quite simple to display data any way you'd like."

Fidelity has real time updates for your portfolio only during trading hours but not extended hours real time (shouldn't have to use stock twits).

It's accounting things in think it should be less then 38 bucks. But honestly we are very spoiled with free trades. When I first started buying stocks it was 15 bucks a trade.

But the fact is, the big players are afraid to trade with each other because they’re always afraid their on the wrong side of the trade. But they will literally pay to trade with retail investors because the fact that retail investors are initiating the trade is all they need to know to confirm theyre probably making a good trade against a sucker.

If RH users think that ""big money"" is screwing with their thousands, just check the execution quality, it will tell much more than any words. I don't use Robinhood and I don't plan to.

Also, as I mentioned in the comment above, there is a huge difference between market making and screwing clients. I don't think they're making any money from the hundreds of dollars of retail trading GME back and forth and neither are big players that move around milions of dollars.

2021-06-14 04:48:17,stocks,"Of course you are right in a technical sense.  But again, this is a veil of semantics over the same thing. How they monetize the information and position doesn’t change what’s really happening. 

Measuring price execution is a red herring. If those market prices were the whole story why don’t the funds trade with each other? Because they have decades of experience knowing that trading with other sharp money is at best a waste of time, if not outright dangerous. That’s why the most sophisticated traders have to put half their energy into disguising and executing trades in dark pools so they don’t tip their hand and distorting markets. 

That’s why if another fund says “sure, well buy $XX for $100 they’ll say, oh yeah? Actually I need $101” but if it’s a robin hood trader they don’t have to worry about asymmetric information so they’re essentially like shit, this must be garbage. “You can have it for $99”

Google “winners curse” for the broader concept of why sophisticated traders are reluctant to trade with other sophisticated traders (and you should be to). The main take away, is that the expected value of any trade you make is inversely correlated with how sophisticated your counter party is."

Investors in CVX and XOM are there for one reason - cashflows. At a decent oil price (like now) their valuation for cashflow is very very attractive, even if set to decline into the future. A year long protest outside their office in California doesn’t change cashflows at all

Remember, a peak oil demand in 2030 means we basically use as much oil in 2040 as today since we will be increasing until that point. That’s 20 years of runway to be at the same demand point. Yet their valuations assume their revenue dries up well before then.

I really think that’s a poor argument, things these companies did 20/30/40 years ago as the reason consumers will cut them out?  They haven’t yet, and have known those things for years. Even the “buried” reports from the 70’s by Exxon were widely know to governments, the public and all corporations by the mid 1990’s. No one changed anything then.

For starters, ""adult"" companies don't use regular banks, there is a whole industry of payment processors and banks set up specifically for ""sin"" businesses that mainstream banks and payment processors don't want to have anything to do with for PR purposes. These alternate payment processors typically charge significantly higher fees than regular ones, and are immune to boycott pressures. These processors are also the same ones utilized by Subscribestar  and other people and organizations that have been blacklisted from modern society for wrong think.

Also, advertisers on adult sites don't give a damn about PR, their only concerned is not having their ads played on illegal content. That's it. If you're selling enlarging pills then all that's important is making the sale.

I recall it being marketed for the broad public 4 or 5 years ago (ie the Samsung Gear VR, lots of 360° videos appearing on YouTube, ... ). The whole thing didn't really catch on, mostly because of missing use cases, huge processing power requirements and people reporting nausea when using it. Now while I wouldn't compare it to the 3D TV, atm it's not more than a videogame genre, reserved to a fraction of gamers. The market is growing slowly compared to other digital trends and I don't see it reaching the average citizen in the next years.

Maybe there needs to be a sister tech to really push it forward.  Something that allows vr and AR to be experienced without the use of a device that is held or worn.  Basically it needs to be easier and less dorky for it to catch on.

From all accounts it's exactly the same as other video sites enforcing stricter controls over content for legal and business purposes. Given the nature of the website, it makes complete sense, even the biased article mention the issue with revenge videos uploaded by exes which is a serious problem and hard to track.

What surprises me is that Visa and MasterCard even processed their payments in the first place, most adult sites have to go through third-party payment processors, and the article even ends saying that Visa and MasterCard would be willing to restate their business with them pending review, making the idea of some sort of religious puritan boogeyman even more absurd"

In Buffett’s own words:

“The boxed-chocolates industry in which it operates is unexciting: Per-capita consumption in the U.S. is extremely low and doesn’t grow. Many once-important brands have disappeared, and only three companies have earned more than token profits over the last forty years.”

But wait, there’s more!

“...the bulk of its revenues from only a few states, accounts for nearly half of the entire industry’s earnings.”

It’s popular in a few states — a regional phenomenon — which has hardly managed 2% growth per year. It was only a worthwhile investment because it delivered consistent cash flow and it was able to raise prices while keeping costs in check. 

2% annual growth from 1972-2007 doesn’t even keep with inflation. He could have parked money in a savings account and earned more in the first 15 years."

If an investor owns a lemonade stand, then they'd be foolish to sell the company for $100 when they could liquidate the lemonade stand's assets for $200. But this simplified scenario probably doesn't exist for publicly traded companies. I'm not so sure that for google or amazon it makes sense to value the company by their assets/earnings when there is zero way to access that. An investor can't feasibly liquidate the company, and they can't even hope to receive any of the earnings when they are anti-dividend companies. They just have to hope that the market continues to value the company based on the assets/earnings despite not having any actual access to that. If the market consisted of myself and clones of myself, the price of amazon and google would plummet unless they indicated to investors some sort of end game plan."
2021-06-13 23:01:33,stocks,"If you own stock, you are accessing earnings and asset growth, even if there is no dividend. 

Think of it this way. If there is a dividend, you have a choice what to do with your share of the company earnings. You can take that dividend money, spend it somewhere else. You can buy a coffee. You can buy a video game. You can invest in another company. That’s all your decision. 

If there isn’t a dividend, you are still getting a share of the company earnings. But you don’t have a choice, the decision has been made for you (by the majority owners via the board and handpicked CEO). Instead of you putting that money in your pocket and spending it on whatever you want, that dividend you would have received instead goes towards something the company believes is worthwhile. Maybe they buy a lemon grove. Maybe they buy some new juicing machines. Maybe they spend more for a new talented lemonade engineer. Maybe they build their war chest to buy out their closest competitor. Bottom line, instead of you taking your dividend and doing god knows what, they’re taking your dividend and growing the company. And assuming they make a wise decision, they make the company more valuable, because they either added valuable assets or added more earnings in the future. That added value is reflected in the share price, and that’s where you benefit. If you want to take that money out, you can do it at any time, by selling a portion of your stock. 

I’ll say it again, stock is ownership. Even if you have one share, you are an owner. You can show up to the shareholder meeting and vote if you want. Think that lemon grove is a dumb idea? You can vote on it! Sure, if you’re small lemons, you can’t influence anything. But larger investors definitely can. And you’ll benefit from their decisions the same as they do. If they sell the company for cash, you get your share of the cash. If they make their shares more valuable by making the company more valuable, your share gets more valuable too. 

Yes, sometimes valuations become detached from fundamentals. In those cases you have to be wary things could come back to earth. But stocks do have actual value and the more success a company has, the more value your shares will be."
2021-06-14 00:38:40,stocks,"I guess in my humble opinion, there comes a time when it doesn't make much sense to reinvest money into the company. Companies can only grow so much - there is a limit to company growth. The bigger a company gets, the more diminishing returns there are on reinvesting money. Can Amazon and Google really get that much bigger? Maybe but we'd all agree they are near their peak, right? I see that reinvesting money becomes a waste and when a company becomes huge they should shift their focus from growth to just maintaining their size/profits and providing income to investors. 

And I find it to be a fundamental negative that you're required to sell the company in order to profit from it. What if an investor wants to invest for life? If there are no dividends they can only sell the company in order to profit.

This is why I personally see that a stubborn refusal to ever give dividends takes away from the value of a company despite assets/earnings.

But I see your point of view and it also makes sense. It is how the market seems to think as well. The market doesn't care much about dividends."

I recently had a opportunity to buy in during the massive dip due to the injury bad publicity which leaded to a  recall and legal battles. Many people including investment recommendation reports said sell and get out. I bought and then bought more on its way down.  Most all of these reports have bit there tongues and retracted thier reports after peleton reported thier 4th quarter. Also followed by news of a huge $400 Million manufacturing plant being built in Ohio which Will solve alot of thier previous issues of supply keeping up with demands. Peleton is actively showing new growth and revenue every quarter and the company itself has proved to handle numerous situations that it faced with confidence and solution.  Read the charts and do your DD peleton is here to stay for now and expected price per share should raise to previous high and then exceed in the future.  IMO If your interested now is the time to get in with a temporary setback in cost per share.

2021-06-13 20:50:16,stocks,Too many ! Pick 6 stocks and stick with those. But I do like the list.
2021-06-14 19:03:55,stocks,Good portfolio. I am having nvda too. Planning to sell after the split.
2021-06-14 11:13:36,stocks,If you don’t live in the Netherlands would recommend switching to RDSB. A shares are subject to a Dutch dividend withholding tax.

2021-06-13 23:46:30,stocks,Does that reasoning justify buying into stocks that have been up 50% from pre-covid just because more large and mega cap stocks are at ATH?
2021-06-13 23:45:02,stocks,"Even so, that is priced in. The stock market is forward looking, as such DIS exploded upward in the last year knowing that the parks reopening will be a big deal. However, even when they fully open, does that justify the almost doubling of stock price and market cap?"
