I think they’d survive a recession fine, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see sharp drops during it"
6/14/2021 19:46,stocks,"I had ARM back when it was an independent stock. ARM chip is in everything.   Then bought into TSM to at least stay close to it when it was acquired by Softbank.  I found TSM a good play to keep me close to many of the semiconductor companies who outsource to TSM (like NVDA).  I like ARM, but found NVDA a bit over valued for my taste.  I have been buying into QCom, and smiled at the recent news that they were throwing their hat in the ring."
6/14/2021 19:15,stocks,"I had been assuming that the chances of the acquisition happening were 10% or less. I’d imagine if/when it falls through it’ll cause a temporary dip, but NVDA still has plenty of growth ahead with or without ARM."

6/14/2021 19:36,stocks,"I like Oshkosh as a company but be wary they rely heavily on government contracts.

If they fail to win a few other big ones once the others are done, their value could go south quickly. 

Not saying it’s a bad investment, BUT please understand that their lack of revenue diversification poses as a big risk to future returns. Other than that their fundamentals are pretty solid."
6/14/2021 19:39,stocks,"Agreed, also I believe that only around 30% if Income is from defense.  They actually make most of their income from access segment.  Aninfrastructure bill (god willing) would be a boon for them."
6/14/2021 18:44,stocks,"I use (5-year-average earnings or FCF) x (multiple) = stock’s target market cap. Then compare it to the stock’s current market cap.

If it’s less than 1, probably it’s undervalued.

If it’s more than 1, probably overvalued, but you can still project their growth and find its average because it can still be undervalued if they have some assumptions of future earnings or FCF.

I prefer FCF though since it’s harder to be manipulated than earnings.

For multiple, for a fast-growing company, I use 20-25. If it’s a slow-growing company, I use 15. My margin of safety, I use around 10-12."
6/14/2021 19:10,stocks,"First: congratulations! If you can figure the qualitative part you are ahead of most people and remember it is the most important part. If you buy a high quality business even if you pay a bit too much, time will eventually fix your misscalculation

As for the formula try different things and see which makes you more comfortable. For example:
5 year average Operating income or net earnings whichever is lower multiplied by the average P/E of the company of the last 10-15 years should give you a fair price assuming the company is going to grow its earnings in the future. Anything below that is a buy because eventually the stock is suposed to come back to its average valuation so if they grow, that average valuation will mean a higher stock price than it is now"
6/14/2021 19:28,stocks,"Buffet has said that they don't use some 'ultimate formula', but rather it 'should be obvious' when a company is undervalued. Look for different indicators. DCF analysis is one way. But even then you are predicting what the company will make each year, which is still 100% guessing. If you take their average free cash flow per year and multiply by 10, and it's less than their market cap, then that company may be undervalued. But it could also be a dying company. 

Look at similar companies (relative valuation). Does the company have a sustainable competitive advantage for the future? (i.e. a moat)."
6/14/2021 19:12,stocks,"Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies from McKinsey provides a very detailed approach to valuing companies, which I found very helpful. Rather time-consuming, so not useful for screening, but quite a useful exercise to validate your hypothesis before pulling the trigger.

Free Cash flow (normalised), discounted in perpetuity at 8% is my go-to quick & dirty valuation method."
6/14/2021 18:21,stocks,"My overly simplistic way. I cut their Rev growth in half from their average last 4 quarters, and apply it 5 years out. Then cut their PS or PE by 20% or so. Then that’s my conservative price target

This assumes a growing market trend in their business or whatever as well."

6/14/2021 19:16,stocks,Do you not take debt into account here. Different capital structures can lead to drastically different multiples and enterprise values. You seem to be conflating a TEV calculation and assuming it’s equal to market cap.

6/14/2021 18:32,stocks,"That's a good way for projecting a future price target. I'm more asking about calculating on if something is a value *now,* versus later. Or are you somehow building in the price into your growth model? 

&#x200B;

In short, if the stock I'm researching is $10.00/share today, I want to be able to say, ""ahh, that's a good price, I would've paid $10.25"", or on the flip side, ""oooh, $10.00/share is higher than the $9.50 I'm willing to pay."" In other words, in case I'm unclear in my request, I'm trying to ascertain if *today's price* is a good price."

6/14/2021 19:41,stocks,"So right now my system is obviously being fine-tuned, but I basically do a +/- system, where these categories get a + or -:

\-Cash on hand increasing or decreasing past 3 years? Increasing +, Decreasing -

\-Earnings growing last 3-5 years? Yes is +, no is -

\-Any concerning or high-profile litigation that can affect the stock price? No is a +, yes is a -

\-P/E below the 5-year average? Yes is +, No is -

\-PEG ratio lower than 2? If not is it lower than other companies in the sector? If yes to either, it's a +

\-R&D spending increasing last 3 years? Yes +, No -

\-Gross Sales (if selling product) or Gross Margin increasing? Yes +, No -

I simply add those up, and if there's more pluses than minuses, it's a buy. If they're equal, it's a hold. If there's more minuses, it's a sell."

6/14/2021 19:52,stocks,"I don't see the cash on hand one tbh. If a company decreases it's cash on hand to fund a purchase that will positively impact the return of equity then it should be a +. For all the others seems pretty good and I never thought of it, maybe I start doing something similar idk"

6/14/2021 18:22,stocks,Depends how fast it grew abs why. I had a lot of conviction in FLGT but did not recognise the short squeeze. Missed cashing out at 200% gains instead of the 50% gains I cashed out at knowing it had peaked and will take years of post pandemic earnings  growth to validate the peak price. Kick myself every time I think about it
6/14/2021 18:31,stocks,"What else are you going to do with that money?

The past performance isn't really relevant to your current decision. If you have a strong conviction that this particular stock is going to double again in the next year (or whatever), there are only two reasons to cash out now: either you need that money for a different investment (that you expect to perform even better than this one), or you are equally certain that the price is going to go back down again before it reaches that higher level and you think you can buy back in lower.

Edit: that's ignoring concerns like diversification or a changing risk profile."

6/14/2021 17:43,stocks,Don’t listen to that idiot as he’s talking about selling CCs.  When you buy a call it gives you the right to buy the shares if they’re in the money at expiration.   You aren’t forced to buy the shares if they’re OTM or ITM. If they are OTM at expiration then you do nothing as it’s worthless.  If they’re ITM and you don’t have enough funds to cover then your broker will either sell them and send you the difference or give you the shares and then must come up with the money or sell them ASAP.  I use TDA and it’s gone both ways when I had an option expire ITM.  Luckily on Monday the stock didn’t go down and I got out unscathed.

If there are advisors suggesting to pull, then they're likely right, or they're doing their customers a disservice to save their own skin from owing customers. The markets been a fools errand since March last year when the market decided to magically recoup in less than a year; it took 6+ years for other crashes to recoup and exceed beyond their initial drop point.

Sure, you could argue technology creates exponential levels of recuperation within markets and economies, it can also create a exponential downfall. Where there is a Yin, there is a Yang.

Don't forget, most market rules in effect today are from when markets weren't digitized. You're lying to yourself otherwise, please research into the DTCC, SEC, FINRA, etc.

Inflation can be good or bad, looks like its on the cusp from going good for majority of investors and bad for the select few higher up, to bad for majority, and good for select higher up.

JPowell and his ""finance know it all's"" dumped loads of money into the American economy, with what is assumed nowhere near where the job markets % of employed should be, yet somehow the economy and general public is doing better than it was before march 2020?

Idk about you but when I step away from my screen and see twice as many people on the street due to house and business foreclosure (By the way, large funds are purchasing bankrupt houses by the hundreds of thousands, to be sold back to general public as rentals), that tells me something the publicized news doesn't want to say.

Now don't get me wrong, profitable tech got it fairly good but in being specific and going from when the drop really began for the Nasdaq, just as one example:

TSLA: -31% (worse if you go from when it had the blow off top)

AMZN: -10%

That doesn't even get into small cap tech, which don't get me started there...(although I haven't touched any of them). When you think of a ""Growth Investor"" here, many are in those kinds of names and not an AMZN.

But the ""right now"" here is the index itself seems ready to exit a 4 month consolidation period unless a catalyst stops it. I honestly don't think it really ""fully"" happens until next month though."

This tells me that anything that meets those categories is most likely to go green. There's always a little personal judgement on what constitutes a successful category.

&#x200B;

**So for instance, using the Millenial Bets tracker, the best categories are:**

* Total Posts: 1 - 13
* Total Score: 2 - 10, 12 - 14, 18 - 20
* Starting Price Range: $2 - $280
* SPAC: No  


  
Using that criteria I go through the data I download today and filter out anything that doesn't meet the above criteria. That gives me a list of potential stocks

  
I'll take that list and do some quick ""bullish or bearish"" searches on Reddit to try narrow it down to 3 - 5 tickers. From there I'll just spread my money out across them all.

  
When to sell? For each of the criteria above I have the average percent increase (my sell point) and the average number of days to get there (how long to hold). Some weeks I'll be looking at 18% in 3 days, other times I'll be looking at 5% in 6 days. It really depends on the markets that week. In the end, the data just points you to the categories that are most successful"

If you go through the major holders of the stocks being promoted, you’ll see that they are funds that are short on this one stock in particular(not going to mention the name of that stock because I understand not every community wants to be involved with that stock).

This only came out because they were threatened with de-listing if they didn’t file a 10-K. I don’t own it, and don’t really watch it close - but it’s brought up in investor media pretty regularly.

Big Picture: I think many low to mid cap growth stocks in emerging sectors (EV, AI, Blockchain, Etc) rode a huge wave to crazy valuations thanks to low interest rates from about August to Feburary, and then crashed harder than FAANG when the market cycled into value. With money starting to cycle into growth again it feels like the market is being more particular and is betting on established names with market share and pricing power."
6/14/2021 16:18,stocks,"I dont think this stock is treated unfairly mainly due to the amount of uncertanty associated with it. Lordstown is under SEC investigation while failing to raise cash to start production all while everyday they don't have a product on the road, they burn through cash. This is just such an uncertain situation that I and many investors don't want to be   a part off. What I notice about the lordstown defense Is that every bit of information that defends them comes directly from them, it's just kind of obvious when a company is accused of fraud they defend themselves guilty or not so I don't think citing a law firm the company hired or the company themselves is very reliable. This is also not helped by the fact that tesla and Ford are both going to be heavy competition and if they don't clear all this under soon it won't matter if they're guilty or innocent they will be eaten out by the competition. Plain and simple the risk reward here is absolutely terrible, there is just so much that could go wrong you are taking a massive risk compared to the reward."

6/14/2021 15:38,stocks,"Fair points, but they stated that even without the additional capital, they will start with halved production (1100 trucks instead of 2200) and full production if they get the extra money. The funny thing to me is that the news outlets were creating a big deal of them being late with filing the 10-Q, but when they did and announced all the things that were already said in the conference call and earnings report, everyone lost their shit and said LMC is going bankrupt, when they absolutely had to word it that way because of SEC (going concern in the next 12 months without extra capital). They will still be fine until Q2 2022 without the extra money.

I do agree the 20-30$ valuation was a bit crazy at the start of the year, but I don't see how at this point in time, RIDE can be below 12-13$, and I'm trying to be objective and conservative even though I'm bullish on the stock long term.

All of the stuff bears and hates were pointing out in recent months were proven wrong, the only 2 remaining things were the money issues and CEO being hated and considered a scammer/fraud, now he's gone and if they get extra financing, what then? Does the sentiment change to positive, or will people find something else to bash the company with?"
6/14/2021 16:43,stocks,"Fair, thanks for adding to the discussion.

Can't disagree with anything you said, there of course is a lot of uncertainty here, but that's what happens when you're a startup, you've got to prove yourself and if you don't exceed expectations people will bash it, I get all of that, after all, I'm guessing there are just as many blatant haters and trolls as there are people mindlessly pumping the stock without considering the risks and the downsides.

That being said, I think the competition in the EV pickup truck market isn't that harsh that there wouldn't be space for more than the main 3-4 companies. After all, if LMC can start production on time and gets the capital to be able to scale it up, they will be first to market and if the truck is actually good, there will definitely be enough demand for them to sell everything they produce in the coming 2-3 years."

That capital needed is only going to grow and many companies are going to get squeezed because they don’t have the supply chain, purchase power, or pricing power.

So you may ask, why is inflation at only 5%?
The velocity of M2 has went down to half what it was before the pandemic, the American people are saving money, 15% in April in personal savings, compared to a normal 6-8%.

2020 has had a record number of brokerage accounts being opened, there is a ton of money flowing around and it ends up in real estate and the stock market. There is a reason reverse-repo reached 500 billion, too much money supply.

Inflation? Please. Burry announcing his short positions on TSLA practically guaranteed that trade wouldn’t work. 

Look at BTC in May, everyone was saying “skies the limit” then Musk and China change attitude unexpectedly and boom, 50% crash. Then, everyone’s saying, “we got another huge leg down, it’s bad for the environment and it’s going to 19k” and whoops, El Salvador adopted BTC as a currency, musk changed his mind and it turned out to not be bad for the environment and there was a 33% rally in a week.

6/14/2021 16:29,stocks,"GDP doesn't accurately reflect the value of technological value. As technology becomes larger the Buffet ratio will look worse and worse.

It's a good gauge for some industries, but I wouldn't use it as the bible.

6/14/2021 16:35,stocks,"Buffett ratio uses historical GDP data and the stock market is forward looking. 

It is a complete mismatch due to Corona state economy 2020 vs Stock Market Valuation 2021. It’s not like the S&P500 went bankrupt. 

In times like these it is not a useful metric."
6/14/2021 15:53,stocks,"A lot of you are going to get burned by trying to outsmart/time the market. Buying a bond fund is the literal worst thing you can do, and sitting on mountains of cash when the inflation risk is real also means you're going to lose money. 


I've said this over and over - we had a huge drop in the market last year. Yes, it rebounded quickly, but we've had a crash. It's extremely unlikely that we see *another* crash this soon. Could we see a correction? Sure, but if you're expecting another 35-40% drop, you may be waiting a while."
6/14/2021 17:30,stocks,"Crashes usually happen due to failure to redeem debts bringing down major financial institutions. 2000 bust was caused by technology companies borrowing massive amounts of money & going bankrupt & not being able to pay them back. 2008 bust was caused by house buyers borrowing massive amounts of money & getting foreclosed & not being able to pay them back.

You can argue that this is what's happening right now, and frankly I can't tell you one way or another whether it is. But market value vs. GDP alone isn't going to cause a crash. It could cause stagnation and a flat or slow moving bear market if people collectively believe the market is over valued and gradually move their money out - into what? - but a crash is not likely to happen."

6/14/2021 16:40,stocks,How much of it is due to the GDP (the denominator) taking a beating due the pandemic? What will the ratio look like once things have opened up?
6/14/2021 17:59,stocks,"Yes there is going to be a correction. Maybe today, maybe in a week, maybe in a month. Only put enough money into the market that you are willing to gamble with"
6/14/2021 14:26,stocks,Yeah my portfolio went up 38% in the last year. Its just an 2045 retirement std etf. Looking at putting half in cash until it happens. But I need to see the stupid vertical up before I do it.
6/14/2021 14:49,stocks,"Yes, be worried. Reopening has been priced into most stocks and the amount of debt from margin accounts, debt of US government, material costs, inflation, worker shortage from people being paid to stay on unemployment, interest rate increase (J.P. Morgan today reported hoarding cash in anticipation of an increase). There are so many risks right now that even the reopening from COViD and infrastructure bill won’t save the stock market. Correction coming in June/July and it will be worse than the one in mid May"

6/14/2021 18:10,stocks,"This is getting tiresome. It's a 20th century relevant statistic.

In a globalized economy counting a country's GDP when production is overseas will obviously not account for large-caps' actual valuations.

Unless you isolate the metric to small (tops mid-caps) you're mixing loosely relevant things to make the case for what? An impeding crash? 

As I said... EXTREMELY tiresome. Put some 21st century metrics on the table or just stop the baiting/FUD/whatever this is."
6/14/2021 14:58,stocks,I adjusted my portfolios from 100% stocks to 80% stocks/20% bonds in anticipation of a crash. If I see at least a 20% drop in prices then I will sell the bonds and switch back to 100% stock

6/14/2021 19:57,stocks,"Two points I’ll make.

1. The market is where it would’ve been, assuming the same growth rate before COVID. 

Track the rate of growth over 2019, and you can see the trajectory puts us here. Even though we dropped in last March, it just grew really fast to get to this point. Now we’re starting to resume a normal pace of growth.

2. The market reflects the predicted GDP, or where it will be soon, not where it’s at currently. GDP is still low for now, but if we check the buffet indicator in say, 6 months to a year, I bet it’s pretty close to normal again.

3. Plus what other people have said about no two times in the market are the same situation"

6/14/2021 17:02,stocks,"While I think you aren’t wrong in a correction is coming, I think your missing a key factor in timing. If/ when we have one won’t be for a couple years. The feds are still dumping so much money into the economy, there’s so much cash flow that just momentum Alone will propel us for a while. Additionally, we are a global economy and the buffet factor doesn’t necessarily apply anymore. Extraneous circumstances need to be looked at not just the surface aspects."

For everyone quoting the aphorism: *time in the market etc* is failing to realize that that doesn't ALWAYS mean you have to have all your money allocated in one direction.  Buffett doesn't time the market, per se, but he DOES wait for wonderful companies to become attractively priced.  If a wonderful company were attractively priced right now I'd bet he'd buy it.

Additionally look at what he's bought... He DIVESTED out on long term banks he's had (except two... That should be HUGE). He's gone to a very limited portfolio of VERY safe investments (transport/telecoms/CANDY/ Medicine).  

Those are all shit hits the fan stuff to own.   

The writing is on the wall.  It's best to read it!

6/14/2021 18:11,stocks,"There is an infinite money glitch in the Caribbean that you can exploit now and without participating in the stock market:

-Go to any Caribbean island if you are not there already

-wait for someone to become rich in the stock market

6/14/2021 17:13,stocks,"Hoping it lands at the end of July, early August by which time my contract ends & i’ll take my stock profits (If I have any then) I got burnt in Jan/Feb by my greed/inaction. It won’t happen again."
6/14/2021 16:25,stocks,I would assume so
6/14/2021 17:09,stocks,Yes. Also OP math or link he copied is wrong. Currently only 109%. GDP rises and it's back in normal range. Also like another poster said fanng stocks sales go global. US market more global sales than ever.
6/14/2021 16:43,stocks,Most people with significant student loan debt would be on income based repayment and only paying 10% of income over 150% poverty level. I think that will have a much smaller impact than you think.
6/14/2021 19:19,stocks,Good to know. I’ve been stressed about the prospect of my cash is getting eaten up by inflation.
6/14/2021 19:44,stocks,"If you look at Berkshire Hathaway post 2008 he’s underperformed or barely eked out the same as S&P 500. He’s the definition of a has been.

Dude can’t even outperform SPY!"
6/14/2021 17:44,stocks,!RemindMe 25 days
6/14/2021 18:13,stocks,"Okay so how does the US count apples sales towards GDP? If it’s all manufactured in China, wouldn’t the Chinese just be pocketing the numbers toward their gdp since we are techinically importing the iPhones, MacBooks, etc.?"
6/14/2021 16:59,stocks,But there's not much they can do. We know they are not raising rates until 2023 they said and were planning on a 2% inflation but it's way over that and they just can't let it go up indefinitely
6/14/2021 18:30,stocks,Umm economy and stock market are two different things lmao.  God you guys are stupid
6/14/2021 18:22,stocks,lmao. did you go all cash or YOLOed on puts?
6/14/2021 17:44,stocks,"BRRRRRRRRR 

&#x200B;

what inflation? It's only 2%. Oh all those other things that have gone up 20%? Yea we just won't count them."
6/14/2021 19:46,stocks,How could you possibly know that?  All we know is that he was holding a fair amount of puts with unknown strike and date in Scion’s last 13f filing.  We don’t have any idea when he purchased them or how profitable or not they were/are
6/14/2021 19:06,stocks,"I mostly agree with you.  As far as actually timing a crash, it's tough if not impossible.  For the average investor I think there's ways we can prepare for a crash that don't involve precise timing or even short selling.

In this environment, for example, I don't think it's a bad idea to have inflation hedges in place, nor is it a bad idea to be ready for a taper tantrum.  The writing's on the wall.  Nothing needs to be shorted or timed to the tee, but you can put safeguards in place to ensure that when/if shit does hit the fan, you won't be completely wiped out.

It's the age-old wisdom of diversification.  I think it's just even more relevant right now, because as Paul Tudor Jones said today, this market is ""bat-shit crazy""."
6/14/2021 19:53,stocks,True most stuff is predictable but takes longer than you feel it should
6/14/2021 19:56,stocks,"That’s one of his slogans, but pretty useless in this market, no?  Otherwise y’all would be buying Cummins, 3M, Amgen, etc but you’re all saying those are old man stocks"
6/14/2021 16:39,stocks,"So what’s your reasoning for him holding so much cash as far back as 2018? 


He’s said it over and over that he’s had trouble finding large and meaningful acquisitions to make."
6/14/2021 15:42,stocks,Not his personal money. It’s berkshires
6/14/2021 18:43,stocks,I have ~$50K in student loans and my payment per month will be a little more than $400. I make about $90K a year pre-tax so that will definitely impact my spending habits.
6/14/2021 17:53,stocks,I think you're out of your mind.  All that money that was going to student loans was going to other things in the economy.   Now that stops.
6/14/2021 18:16,stocks,Overseas sales from US countries would be included in the USA GNP but not GDP.  Why do you want it in the GDP? What would that mean?
6/14/2021 18:32,stocks,"I don’t think it matters where it is manufactured, sold in china means chinese GDP goes up and Apple pays taxes there for the sale. Same for phones sold in the US. Since there is no import or export happening just one company in different locations."
6/14/2021 17:07,stocks,they can let it keep going up. Historically that's whats been happening.
6/14/2021 19:02,stocks,"Newsflash: the fed can do whatever they want, regardless of what they said before."
6/14/2021 18:07,stocks,/u/the_beast93112 what is the current inflation rate?
6/14/2021 17:51,stocks,It's not way over that? Inflation is measured over the last year. And a year ago we had just started a massive pandemic where over 600k people died? The economy shut down... Of course the number shows it's high but that doesn't mean it is actually high. I don't think you quite understand inflation nor the power of the department of Treasury.
6/14/2021 17:09,stocks,"""We know they are not raising rates until 2023""

Really? Did they say that?"
6/14/2021 18:35,stocks,"I think everyone knows that......typically investors put “money” into “companies” that are in the “economy”. If the “company” is “closed” then investors know it probably won’t make them “money”, when it’s “open” they can make “money”."
6/14/2021 18:18,stocks,"Please feel free to be specific about items that are relevant to the consumer basket and have not been appropriately absorbed in the CPI.

The CPI is a *basket*. It does include some things that have inflated by 20%, weighted for the part of the average consumer’s spending they represent. If an item that is 0.5% of the spending of the average consumer inflated by 20%, it’s barely going to have an effect on the final weighted average that is the CPI."
6/14/2021 16:44,stocks,"When everything is ""overpriced"" it makes it hard to find attractive investments when the sentiment is primarily yield chasing.  Note that he had a bunch of cash on hand to bail out Goldman in 08.  I'd expect similar moves in the future.  

SOFR is coming and it's gonna break the camel's back.  

Also note that Buffett doesn't play in months terms but rather years and decades."
6/14/2021 18:29,stocks,"If they keep printing inflation goes up and we creep closer to hyper inflation, economy goes boom. If they stop printing interest rates goes up, all this cheap money gets really expensive, economy goes boom. 

We have put off real corrections with heavy printing and never recovered after 08. The medicine is coming and it’s going to be much worse than if we trimmed the fat off back then."
6/14/2021 17:30,stocks,"What if inflation goes rogue and become more like hyperinflation? After all, $$ printing volumes are unprecedented."
6/14/2021 18:33,stocks,Yes and the they cannot go back on their word because they pinky swore
6/14/2021 17:10,stocks,That's what JPOW said
6/14/2021 19:57,stocks,"I'm actually genuinely interested in the response to this question. Mostly because I've heard of Toofast4yall's point, but not this counterpoint."
6/14/2021 16:51,stocks,"> When everything is ""overpriced"" it makes it hard to find attractive investments when the sentiment is primarily yield chasing.  


Uhh. Are we talking about the same Warren Buffett?"
6/14/2021 18:51,stocks,should have trimmed the fat with terribly run airlines in march 2020
6/14/2021 18:47,stocks,"You have another choice. Heavily tax the least likely to spend... the rich. Confiscate wealth, bury it in the Fed, monetize what remains, conduct yield control, and nothing goes boom.

The u.s. doesn't have to accept market rates on its debt. It can just refuse to issue debt instruments above its target rate and credit its creditors with new money. Then tax the excess out of the system. Easy peasy mathematically. Impossible politically."
6/14/2021 17:42,stocks,"They have modified cpi more than a dozen times to mask actual inflation rates. What's the difference between 8% and 15% when they pretend it's 3% and inflation is too low?

The way the politicians are going, it looks like inflation is the goal. There isn't a real way for us to pay our debts unless the value goes down and they repay it with inflated dollars."
6/14/2021 19:13,stocks,"Not likely. Reference 1940s. High spikes of inflation at times inflated away massive debt but hyperinflation never set in.

Over the decade a chunk of dollar value will be lost and it may lose reserve status. Plus our ability to get foreign nations to easily eat up our debt may fade. But hyperinflation is unlikely."
6/14/2021 17:32,stocks,"It’s not really a big deal if it goes a little above 2%. I believe it’s been below 2% since the like 90s or something. The only way this is huge is if the market reacts to it. Some valuations will fall but if it’s a good company it will definitely go higher. Which is why it’s a picker’s market right now. You can invest in value stocks if you’re not confident in growth but the growth will definitely have winners. I’d say it’s a bad time to YOLO at shit that you barely know about but if you’re familiar with the company and know it’s going to be fine then it’s not really going to effect it too much. I invest aggressively but I’m confident my positions are not ludicrous. That’s my 2 cents, not that I’m a guru...."
6/14/2021 17:05,stocks,I'm unclear as to what you mean here
6/14/2021 19:04,stocks,"With the fed buying majority of treasuries issued, isn't this mostly the case already?

Also, we've done this before. WWII debt to gdp was above 100%. We printed enough to hold treasury rates low and then told all other holders of treasuries ""lol get fucked"" while their bonds lost value against inflation."
6/14/2021 19:19,stocks,Yes taxing all of your higher producers to 0 will not even cover one year of the budget. We are pass any easy answers. There is not enough money to tax anymore. We are at the “we need to sell the house to make another payment” area now.
6/14/2021 18:07,stocks,Works great for my (fixed interest rate) mortgage too!
6/14/2021 18:35,stocks,"Low inflation has been a monetary policy specifically designed to transfer wealth to the rich. It has been staggeringly effective at this over the last 40 years.

A switch to a higher inflation environment is good for the economy, good for workers, and better macroeconomic policy. It rewards innovation and production rather than finance. 

There will not be hyperinflation. First off, Weimar had to pay debts in foreign currency and were allowed to borrow on international markets. They were also embroiled in a civil war and nobody was paying taxes. This is not the USA, which has the strongest economy in human history, unprecedented military power, and the world academic and economic leader. There is nowhere else to put money productively to use like in the USA, so dollars are always in demand."
6/14/2021 18:49,stocks,They are playing with fire. What if  the genie is out of the bottle and inflation hits 1000% or more? Then it might be too late. I saw it first hand in Russia in nineties. Not pretty.
6/14/2021 18:54,stocks,"You can look at the actual numbers (non-weighted), and you'll see that inflation really isn't anything notable. CPI numbers have been trusted for 100s of years. What makes now any different?"
6/14/2021 18:13,stocks,What in particular is inflating that is relevant to the population at large and not reflected in the CPI?
6/14/2021 18:07,stocks,This is the way.
6/14/2021 18:43,stocks,Is it truly more than a dozen times?
6/14/2021 19:01,stocks,A bit dramatic but I agree with a lot of what you said. Maybe a more watered down version is more appropriate
6/14/2021 19:02,stocks,"I think our understanding of economics, currency and inflation has changed a lot. We will absolutely see results as we have not mastered anything, but we have learned to control and tame things a lot more."
6/14/2021 19:09,stocks,20 times.
6/14/2021 19:54,stocks,Yah I feel like that comment needed a marching band crescendo followed with Pavarotti himself singing the national anthem
6/14/2021 15:43,stocks,"I looked at Camping World awhile ago and liked almost everything aside from one major piece which you didn’t mention here: capital distributions. I don’t remember exactly how much, but the company’s cash flow is not as substantial as it might appear. They make frequent cash distributions to their LLC investors which doesn’t get deducted in their operating cash flows. When I saw this, the valuation looked a lot less attractive and gave me some bad vibes. With that said though, I definitely like the CEO and his TV show."
6/14/2021 14:46,stocks,The opinion of camping world among rv owners is pretty low. This is also a best a pump and dump stock. At some point in the next two years we will see a massive drop in new RV sales as well given how many were sold in the last year.
6/14/2021 15:49,stocks,"Thanks for bringing that up. I actually didn’t know about that, I’m going to look into it. 

It gives me bad vibes though too. I already thought their cash flow was a little weak considering how much long-term debt they have"
6/14/2021 15:29,stocks,"Thanks for bringing that up, i have struggled to find recent customer satisfaction for camping world. I definitely noticed some people hate buying from there on online RV boards. 

I don’t agree with the growth though. Unless you have found other sources, what I’ve seen in articles and projections is that RV sales are expected to continue growing, though you can definitely argue that the growth could de-accelerate but that’s different than a massive decline in sales. 

I’m not even going to comment on pumps, looking for a good discussion on the actual company’s prospects not speculation on pumps"
6/14/2021 16:18,stocks,"The reason why I say sales can not stay as high as they are now is because I think there will be a lot of used RV's hitting the market in a few years for a few reasons

\- RVing is a lot more expensive then many people realize

\- Its getting harder and harder to book campgrounds because there are so many people into the hobby.

&#x200B;

I still think that is 2 or 3 years out though."
6/14/2021 16:14,stocks,i LIKE wish
6/14/2021 13:52,stocks,"While I can see the potential for growth wish is a no go for me due to the fact they sell low quality products. I bought off wish twice before I decided to uninstall the app because I was disappointed with both purchases. Neither products were like the product advertised and after waiting months for delivery buyers remorse was strong. 
There's literally memes about how crappy wish products are.."
6/14/2021 13:38,stocks,"Wish (logistics) local and pick up are why I bought shares in it. It would be limited growth potential without fixing the delivery issues. So the fact they tackling that problem, is a good thing.

Cheap or poor quality products doesn't bother me, as you get what you pay for. If I buy a drone for 10$ that supposed to cost 200$, I should lower expectation.

The amount of people wasting a few dollars on apps and in game purchases, shows their a huge market for cheap low cost items. As long as delivery is quick and priced correctly"
6/14/2021 15:37,stocks,I bought a few shares cuz why not. If it ends up going tits up I wont have lost much and if it goes up well I consider that free money
6/14/2021 16:51,stocks,Wish to me is the new AMC. there is some inherent value there that after all the pumping and dumping could still be worth something. so if you want to join a meme stock play but you're worried about bagholding this one isn't too bad. buy under $10 though.
6/14/2021 14:24,stocks,"I saw that it was dipping, so I bought some."
6/14/2021 15:43,stocks,"> they sell low quality products.

Amazon is making a killing with this strategy."
6/14/2021 15:01,stocks,Great insight.
6/14/2021 16:26,stocks,"But from amazon you expect to get what you pay for, they might be cheap and low quality but they're decent for the price. With wish its literally garbage."
6/14/2021 15:22,stocks,"Thanks. I watched some Warren Buffet book take aways on YouTube and I learned:


1) Choose DANK stocks


2) Buy the dip

3) Hold

EDIT: 4) The entire USA economy is based on a fraudulent system."
6/14/2021 19:29,stocks,Not true. Amazon is selling a ridiculous number of counterfeit goods right now

6/14/2021 14:14,stocks,You should stick to one sector at a time but you don’t really need to be an expert on it.
6/14/2021 15:20,stocks,"I dont think you need to stick to 1 sector as long as its a business you can understand. Known as a circle of competence. For example you would understand home builders like toll brothers, and you would also get zillow. 2 different sectors same circle of competence."
6/14/2021 16:42,stocks,Are looking to purchase individual stocks? Do you already own Index ETFs to ensure diversification independent from your individual stocks?  My first thought is don’t limit yourself to stocks from just one sector and definitely don’t feel you need to own stocks from each sector.
6/14/2021 15:35,stocks,"Second this, and would also like to add that you should be familiar with what typical fundamentals are in your given sector. Tech stocks will have a higher P/E and P/FCF than industrials or financials, but you have to compare them to the sector average to get any meaningful information from them. 

FINVIZ does a pretty good job of highlighting the fundamentals in red/green based on the average fundamentals of the sector, so that's a good place to start.

You don't *necessarily* have a stick to one sector at a time, as a good portfolio should have many different sectors in it, but fundamentals should always take the sector into account, and you should get to know the fundamentals of the industry rather than the specifics of how it operates IMO. 

If you start with a sector you know, you have the advantage of knowing more about the companies in the space. At the same time, it's easy to overvalue a company that way too."

Since this date last week, it has been shown that when used in junction with $PGEN effectiveness has raised in the 79-99% range for various age groups. This only raises chances to pass FDA approval, especially considering they are trying to show that they are working towards cures for diseases without current cures this year. Approval vote is 7-2-21 and only expect price to fluctuate upwards until then. 

Do your own DD but its my PERSONAL opinion that the stock is a great opportunity even without considering it’s possible position if it passes FDA. Just trying to bring attention to a good opportunity incase it doesnt hit the big movers tab, even though it was up 13.24% today."

Certain tech stocks that produce negative profits, sure. But the entire S&P?"

6/14/2021 16:50,stocks,SPY is a collection of all those stocks. All stocks can’t outperform SPY. There were some that tanked.  If you know how to pick winners - that’s awesome. Most don’t.
6/14/2021 16:07,stocks,That was nuts right before close!
6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"Moderate risk, big potential. TRIT Couple weeks ago I picked up some Shares of Triterras ( Trit ) I am up modestly but looks like it's got alot of potential to shoot up.

First, no one is doing what they do.  Using blockchain to make an immutable record for commodities trading, establish finance for smaller commodities traders.  This is a huge Market that is still in the dark ages of paper and pencil.  

Aggressively acquiring businesses to expand their market area and partnerships to provide international money exchange for customers.

Shorts beat this up with speculative claims. Currently shorted to the maximum but climbing back higher.  

Average price target is 16.00 a share.  Looks like a good entry points still as solid support established at 6.70 resistance seems to be 7.00

Really high call volume at the 7.50 level.

Not suggesting to drop your life savings into it but there is potential for very sold gains."
6/14/2021 18:45,stocks,"I have been invested with TRIT for a while now, but I wasn’t all that careful when I bought in. Very recently there has been a bit more excitement with unusual volumes. However, financials have been scarce, it has been impossible to know when the next earnings report will be filed, and lawsuit proceeding have caused negatively for a long time now. When that all changes a lot could happen. Best guess right now is June 30th, unless an extension is filed.

As I said, I am long here, but not real bullish. I guess my rating is HOLD."
6/14/2021 11:41,stocks,"The ceo is very sketchy. He says one thing and does another. The financials and growth of the company are stellar on paper, but why are his own companies, which are suffering financially, the biggest users on his kratos platform? Did you read the second short report? I really don’t trust this company or ceo at all."
6/14/2021 19:02,stocks,"The lawsuits are just typical stock drop nonsense that comes with a short report.  The firm's that filed them literally do this to any company that has a short report.  

I agree the earnings report audit issue is certainly a cause to pause.  However with their activities with securing partnerships ( western union ) and their acquisitions balance that out to me.  

As I said in the title, moderate risk, not a sure thing.  At it's current price I'd still say it's a buy.  If it's 8 or above I'd say hold for that information to come out.

With the current buying frenzies in heavily shorted stocks, and this is certainly shorted to the max, it could easily spike much higher and provide nice gains for those who get in at the current prices"
6/14/2021 11:46,stocks,"They aren't anymore, short report made lots of assumptions and didn't provide any concrete facts.  The irony is that the other company that he owns financial trouble is from a lack of payment from a buyer after delivery done through the old paper and pen style of shipping contract. Something that the kratos platform is designed to prevent and illustrates the need and financial benefit from the Triterras Kratos platform."
6/14/2021 11:49,stocks,"CEO said he was going to buy back shares and did it.

Said he was looking for acquisitions to increase market exposure and did it.

Not saying it's a risk free all in play, but it's fundamentally undervalued and heavily shorted, with a low float especially after the 6.6 million share buyback.  It's a recipe for a big price increase."
6/14/2021 12:37,stocks,"Ceo said he wouldn’t buy back shares and then did. Said he was looking to make acquisitions and expand the business, but then flip flopped and bought shares despite having low capital. Short sellers caused him to flip flop his decisions at a critical growth phase. This does not instill any confidence. The second short report rings absolutely true. 

Probably a very strong chance of being pure fraud."
6/14/2021 12:49,stocks,"He said he Would buy back shares and did.  It's in the sec report.

They have plenty of capital and no debt and make money.

He did just close an acquisition of Dubai based invoice bazaar.  A trade finance company, allowing them to operate in the mid east market as well.

There was no flip flopping.  What they said they were going to do, they did."
6/14/2021 13:41,stocks,"You’re saying the CEO bought shares here, and on your next comment you said he saved the capital and didn’t buy the shares. Which one is it? And also he literally did make acquisitions to expand the business..."

So no, they haven't changed their tune on seeking out acquisitions and bought shares back.  They said they would do both, and did it."
6/14/2021 13:00,stocks,You have obviously not been invested into this company for long. He did say he would not buy shares and instead save the capital. Go read the second short report and listen to the conference calls back in december and you will see how he flip flopped on every call and never addressed the allegations properly. If you still want to invest then you have a stronger stomach than me. Its fraud.
6/14/2021 14:27,stocks,"No, read it again. The guy said he will not buy, then flipped a week later and reversed every statement after questioned. Trust me i followed this company back last year. This is not trustworthy. Very very likely fraud."
6/14/2021 14:18,stocks,Yeah I'm not sure where this guy is getting everything backwards.  He has literally said the opposite of everything said and done.

6/14/2021 14:25,stocks,"That should tell you something. Im not afraid of risk, but this company is an obvious fraud and the ceo is not trustworthy at all. Do what you want, but it is probably going to $0 one day without warning."

6/14/2021 11:24,stocks,">According to the research report, the global Breast Cancer Treatment Market was estimated at USD 19.24 Billion in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 34.06 Billion by 2026. The global Breast Cancer Treatment Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.5% from 2019 to 2026

**Observation**

* Zero debt
* \>$130m cash on hand
* Cash stated to last them well into 2024 calendar year
* Great management
* around $3m quarterly spending
* Has recently ramped up quarterly spending
* recently stated to be aggressively pushing for phase 3 trials
* recently approved to conduct trials in EU market
* drug has several other beneficial uses besides breast cancer (versatile)
* has found a new & higher support level after recent ""buy the news sell"" off
* Russell 2k on 25th will trend pps upwards
* Recently canceled proposal to increase share dilution

**Thoughts**

Any good news will give investors something to smile about either short term or long term.

The monopoly the company will hold over this drug will spark a crazy bidding war when its time for a buyout. AND the talks of seeking a partnership will ensure companies seeking to buy them out come correctly with a sizable offer. I saw **ITOS**  partnership announcement earlier in the cancer space. That's just for phase 1 trials. Giving me even more confidence in a partnership since **ATOS** will be entering phase 3 trials. The best event this month is the upcoming russell 2k. Indices will be snapping up bulks of shares. Right now investors are in what I call ""the before."" Before major indices join in, before the market cap reaches >$1B which will make it stable and bring a new wave of investors institutional & retail alike. Before news networks start talking about this company. Before social media and the internet spread into the mix. Once it's approved in the USA/EU market- that's pretty much a global market guarantee. I'm just so overwhelmingly confident in this company.

**Feelings**

Didn't feel to good about the loss I took in last weeks dip. It hurt. I held true to my convictions though because I do believe in this company. IF NOT FOR ANY OTHER REASON, then for the gains I'm certain I'll make in the future as investor. I'm more than happy with today's movements. My sentiments are satisfactory so far.

**Conclusion**

More people need to talk about this on reddit. We've essentially became our own source for support in the market. For better or for worse. We are also the key catalyst in companies hitting the internet and spreading chatter. I'm glad to see talk of it on this subreddit growing, slowly, but surely."

I found old data [from this site noting](https://web.archive.org/web/20080516032316/http://www.bioportfolio.com/news/datamonitor_16.htm) Tamoxifen sales were $1b in 2001, and Endoxifen is expected to supercede Tamoxifen, so assuming zero growth since 2001 and if we purely [adjust for inflation that's $1.5b of annual sales](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/).

Assume results are great, Endoxifen becomes the new standard of care and takes over that $1.5b in sales. So, using a P/S of 5 (like an astrazeneca or pfizer) that's 5 x $1.5b = $7.5b mkt cap = $62 SP. This ignores other products ATOS is developing. Hard to find recent/reliable/free industry data."
6/14/2021 17:04,stocks,"I think you should look into their clinical trials first. I just did a quick search in the clinical trials database, and it looks like they have not even started recruiting for their phase 2 trials in Australia. This drug has so far to go for being approved in the US. 

For comparison, Tamoxifen, which was invented in the 60s and not approved for use until 1977, isn’t even close to the most commonly prescribed breast cancer medication. 

To get numbers like you’re predicting, this drug would have to be worth multiples more than Tamoxifen is to get significant revenue. Additionally, the company that started with the trials and research for Tamoxifen wasn’t even the one that ended up getting it approved and manufactured for most uses, it was sold to Zeneca (now AstraZeneca). 

And tamoxifen is approved for many more uses than treating breast cancer, it’s also approved for preventing, which didn’t happen until 1998. So after existing on the market since 1977 the value of this drug is only $1bn in 2001, for all it’s combined indicated uses. 

For comparison, most of the newest standard of care cancer meds have market shares of over $10bn per year per company. That’s not even including the combined generic market. This drug is so worthless right now you’d be foolish to invest in it. 

Just my two cents.

The [USPS Next generation Delivery Vehicle Project](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2021/0223-multi-billion-dollar-modernization-of-postal-delivery-vehicle-fleet.htm) was recently awarded to Oshkosh Defense, which had extreme effects on the share price of [$WKHS – Workhorse.](https://utradea.com/stocks/WKHS) However, the question I wanted an answer to is did this occurrence make Workhorse an undervalued growth stock, or is Workhorse still overvalued even after their share price was massacred? This question led me to undergo this analysis to find out.

**Company Overview:** 

Workhorse is a technology company focused on renewable, and cost-effective solutions in the transportation sector (they make EV’s). Workhorse is an all-American electric delivery truck, and drone manufacturer that is constantly looking for new ways to innovate and optimize their mechanisms. Workhorse is currently working on bringing their [C-Series](https://workhorse.com/cseries.html) electric **delivery trucks** to the market to fulfill previous order request. Workhorse is an OEM trying to satisfy the requirements for their Class 2 – Class 6 commercial-grade, medium-duty truck market.

Workhorse has highlighted some of the biggest benefits derive from using their vehicles, these include:

· Lower total cost-of-ownership compared to conventional gasoline/diesel vehicles (estimated to save $170k in fuel savings compared to their fossil fuel counterparts)

· Increased package deliveries per day through the use of more efficient delivery methods

· Improved profitability through lower maintenance costs and reduced fuel expenses

· Improved vehicle safety and driver experience.

Currently, Workhorse is selling their vehicles to their clients using the following distributors Hitachi, Ryder, and Pritchard. Furthermore, 2 of their distributors (Ryder and Pritchard) are also maintenance providers for Workhorse.

Currently, Workhorse has successfully delivered 370 electric delivery vehicles to their customers, and they are the only American OEM to reach these figures, which is quite the accomplishment. These customers consist of the following companies Alpha Baking, [FedEx](https://utradea.com/stocks/FDX), Fluid Market Inc., Pride Group Enterprises, Pritchard, [Ryder](https://utradea.com/stocks/R), [UPS](https://utradea.com/stocks/UPS), and WB Mason.

Workhorse’s Series-C delivery truck comes in 2 configurations, a 650 cubic ft., and a 1,000 cubic ft configuration. Furthermore, their Series-C vehicles include lightweight materials, 360-degree camera’s, collision avoidance, best-in-class turning radius, and their very own roof mounted [HorseFly delivery drone.](https://workhorse.com/horsefly.html) These features help to set Workhorse apart from both their electric and fossil fuel competitors, especially their roof-mounted drone.

**Investment Information:**

*USPS Next Generation Delivery Vehicle Project:*

Last year, Workhorse was in competition to win a USPS contract to manufacture 165,000 vehicles for USPS to order and use as mail delivery vehicles. There were 4 other participants in this program, and Workhorse delivered 6 of their prototype vehicles for testing to potentially win this contract. On February 23rd, 2021, it was announced that Workhorse would not be obtaining this contract, but rather Oshkosh Defense.

This came as a surprise to many people and investors and WKHS share price was greatly affected by this news. However, this also created a buying opportunity for investors, as this contract was not the be all and end all of Workhorse’s business. Workhorse still manufactures their electric vehicles and has great potential in the EV Trucking space.

*HorseFly Technology:*

As I previously mentioned, Workhorse has their HorseFly drones built into their delivery vehicles. These HorseFly drones are patented, unmanned, and are incorporated into Workhorse’s delivery vehicles in order to deliver packages more efficiently.

These HorseFly drones are capable of carrying up to 10 pounds of packages (payload) and can reach maximum speeds at approximately 50 mph (80km/hr).

The HorseFly system includes an aircraft, a Ground Control Station (GCS), supports takeoff/landing, and has a cargo handling system. This system is designed to support high volumes of packages, long days of use, little maintenance is required, and the system allows Remote Pilots in Command (RPIC) allowing one pilot to control multiple drones.

Workhorse’s drones have been proven to be safe, reliable, and capable of delivering packages.

*Metron:*

Workhorse has a cloud-based, remote management system to trach vehicular performance, which they have called “Metron”. [Metron](https://workhorse.com/metron.html) collects data and signals while the truck is driving and stores this data in their database and is shared to their clients. This data will be used to map specific route parameters to better manage the battery power, which can help maximize efficiency and determine the ideal times and locations to charge their batteries.

*Partnerships:*

*Duke Energy:* 

Workhorse has entered into a partnership with [$DUK - Duke Energy](https://utradea.com/stocks/DUK) to create an innovative battery leasing program that provides customers with options and cost-competitive alternatives. Duke can also provide depot-wide electrification, battery leasing, and distributed energy resources to Workhorse’s customers. Duke and Workhorse \[partnered to make an integrated solution to help reduce the costs of converting existing fleets to quicken their adoption.

*Moog:*

Workhorse has also partnered with a company called [$MOG-A - Moog](https://utradea.com/stocks/MOG-A). This partnership is a joint venture (50%-50%) for the development of the unmanned aerial systems (UAS), (their drones). Teams from both Workhorse and Moog are working on developing these drones, their systems, and their sub-systems to improve their quality and make them the most capable UAS in the market. Their goal for these UAS is to be highly reliable, safe, and certified by the highest levels of government approval.

*Emission and Fuel Economy Standards:*

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issues increasingly stringent fuel/emission standards for 2021-2027. In this document they highlight Workhorse as a “vocational vehicle” manufacturer, which makes Workhorse eligible for flexibility and incentive programs, such as the [Averaging, Braking, and Trading Program (ABT).](https://www.epa.gov/ve-certification/averaging-banking-and-trading-abt-report-template-and-guidance-locomotive-engines) This program allows fuel consumption credits to be banked, traded, or averaged. This will allow Workhorse to sell these credits to companies who have larger than mandated emissions.

*Clean Air Act:*

Workhorse has already acquired their Certificate of Conformity from the EPA. This certificate is required to be able to sell vehicles in states covered by the Clean Energy Act (ie. California).

*Intellectual Property:*

Workhorse currently has 8 existing patents, 1 of which is Canadian and covers their vehicle chassis assembly, and the other 7 are American covering vehicle chassis assembly, vehicle headers, onboard generator system, UAS package delivery system, and their drive module. Additionally, Workhorse has 19 pending patent applications.

Furthermore, Workhorse has 14 issued trademarks (US, and Internationally) and has filed for 5 more trademarks.

*Property:*

Workhorse owns 2 pieces of real estate, one of which is their 250,000 sq ft manufacturing plant in Union City, Indiana, and the other is a 45,000 sq ft administrative, manufacturing, and R&D plant in Loveland, Ohio.

Furthermore, Workhorse leases 2 factories which are also located in Loveland, Ohio.

It is good to see that Workhorse has purchased these 2 factories as they will have greater control over what they chose to do and their methods of manufacturing. Also, paying off equity in these 2 factories is essentially paying down an asset.

*Financial Information:*

· **2016 Stock Incentive Plan:** Currently, there are still 102,500 shares yet to be converted from existing warrants from Workhorses 2016 stock incentive plan. If these shares were to be converted and dumped into the market, it would cause a dilutionary effect of 0.08%

· **2017 Stock Incentive Plan:** Currently, there are 2,247,500 common shares, and 1,475,625 shares that can be converted from warrants that are yet to hit the market from Workhorse’s 2017 stock incentive plan. If these shares were to be put on the market this year, it would cause dilutionary effect of roughly 3.02% on existing shares.

· **2019 Stock Incentive Plan:** There are also 773,115 common shares that can be converted from warrants, and 4,332,011 shares that are yet to be issued from Workhorse’s 2019 stock incentive plan. If these shares were to be converted and dumped into the market, it would cause dilutionary effect of roughly 4.14%

· **Series B Preferred Stock:** In 2019, Workhorse offered some Series B Preferred Shares to accredited investors. Workhorse sold 1,250,000 of these shares, and each of these preferred shares can be converted into 7.41 common shares. If all of these preferred shares were converted there would be 9,262,500 common shares, however, we know that in 2019 and 2020, 1.6M shares were issued through the conversion of preferred shares. Meaning that there is a maximum of 7,662,500 common shares that can be converted. If all of the remaining preferred shares were to be converted, then it would cause a dilutionary effect of roughly 6.22%

· **2024 Convertible Notes:** Currently, there is $197.7M worth of convertible notes, which are convertible at $35.29/share. This means that there are 5,602,154 shares that can be converted from these notes. If this were to happen, existing shares would exhibit dilutionary effects of 4.55%.

· **Marathon Warrant Agreement:** In 2018, Workhorse sold Marathon Asset Management a warrant to purchase 8,053,390 shares for an exercise price of $1.25. If these warrants were to be exercised and sold, there would be dilutionary effects of 6.53%.

· **RSU and Options:** In Workhorses stock-based compensation they also offer options and restricted stock units (RSU), and as of December 2021, there are 1.97M shares available from options to be purchased at $2.10/share (exercisable over the next 1.8 years), and 1.37M shares in RSU’s (which is expected to be recognized over the next 1.7 years). If all of these options are exercised, and the RSU’s are vested then there will be dilutionary effects of 2.72%.

· **Financial Performance (Good):** Workhorse had a great year in 2020, as their net sales increased by 269.80% (and their cost of sales only increased by 123.56%), their net income was $69.78M (which is the first time they have reported a positive net income), they reported revenue from their drones for the first time, and they paid off $19.14M in long-term debt.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** Workhorse’s gross loss increase by 113.35% however their surge in “other income” helped to prop up earnings (they are not making money from solely the sale of their vehicles), and their interest expense increased by 553.67%.

· **Liquidity:** Workhorse has nearly doubled their cash position YoY, from $23.9M to $46.8M. They noted that they will use some of this cash to finance projects in 2021 in their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-21-003538/)

*Management Team:*

**Duane Hughes (CEO, President, and Director):** Mr. Hughes has 20 years of direct experience and has relationships in the automotive, advertising, and technology industries. Prior to Workhorse, he worked at Cumulus Interactive Technologies Group as their COO, and prior to this he worked as VP of sales and operations for Gannett Co. Inc.

**Robert Willison (COO):** Mr. Willison previously served as the Director of Fleet Technology for Sysco Corp. Prior to Sysco, Mr. Willison worked as the CTO of Rav Technologies.

**Steve Schrader (CFO):** Mr. Schrader has over 16 years of experience in public and private companies in a variety of industries. Prior to Workhorse Steve was the CFO of Fuyao Glass America for 4 years.

**Stephen Fleming (VP):** Mr. Fleming worked at Workhorse for 9 years as corporate/securities counsel before being promoted to VP. Previously to that, Mr.Fleming served as the managing member of Fleming PLLC, which is a boutique law firm specializing in corporate/securities law.

Although these people do not have the most extensive background in the automotive industry they have a solid background in business, finance, and technology. This is good to hear as they should be able to run this business from a management standpoint, however, where these people lack expertise in the automotive field, they can consult their board of directors who have worked for companies like GM, Piston Group, Cadillac etc. This helps to create a well-rounded management team that I believe is capable of running this business properly.

**Investment Valuation:** 

Due to Workhorse’s current financial information, I am not able to create a DCF model in order to value the company. However, I was able to undergo comparable analyses, in which I compared Workhorse’s EV/Assets, EV/Revenue and P/B multiples to their competitors. In order to arrive at an unbiased valuation, I took a weighted average of the comparable analyses.

*EV/Assets:*

By comparing this multiple to their competition, I arrived at a fair value of $WKHS of $11.97, if this were the case the implied downside would be 22.91%.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Workhorse’s EV/Revenue multiple to their competition, I arrived at a fair value of $535.36, which would imply an upside of 3347.23%. This is absurdly high and is due to $NKLA – Nikola having an EV/Revenue multiple of 153,392.

*P/B:*

By comparing Workhorse’s P/B ratio to their competitors, I arrived at a fair value per share of $14.73, which would imply a downside risk of 5.14%.

*Weighted Average Comparable:*

Since the EV/Revenue comparable implied such a large upside I gave it a weight of 6.6% (20% of equal weight (33%).) the other two results achieve in the comparable analyses are both then weighted equally at 46.7%.

By doing this I arrived at an estimated fair value per share of $15.93, which would imply that Workhorse has a potential upside of 2.58%. This essentially means that you are buying close to fair value, which helps to mitigate risk.

*Analyst Coverage:*

The average analyst price target of 7 Wall Street analysts for $WKHS – Workhorse is $15.70, which would imply an upside of 1.09%, this implies that Workhorse is an undervalued growth stock. These estimates are similar to the results I achieved in my comparable analyses.

**Risks:**

· **Dilution:** Workhorse has had problems with their levels of dilution in the past as they have averaged 44.64% share dilution per year over the last 3 years. Furthermore, these high levels of dilution are also looking pretty likely in the future as Workhorse is yet to offer all of the shares from their 2016, 2017, and 2019 stock incentive plans, their Series B Preferred Shares, their 2024 Convertible Notes, their Warrant Agreement with Marathon Asset Management, their RSU’s, and finally their outstanding options. All of these programs, plans, and agreements will account for approximately 27.26% of future share dilution. This level of previous dilution, and the levels of expected dilution are very high, even for a high-growth, high-potential stock like Workhorse, and should worry current and potential investors alike.

· **Financial Performance:** As stated previously, Workhorse has a couple sections of their financial reports that did not look so favourable (gross loss increase, and high interest expense growth.) If Workhorse does not continue to make large sums of revenue from their “other revenue” segment, then their losses will appear bigger, and they may not report another positive year (like they did this year). This would be detrimental for the stock and scare off investors.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Workhorse increased their net sales by 269.80% (and their cost of sales only increased by 123.56%), their net income was $69.78M (which is the first time they have reported a positive net income), they reported revenue from their drones for the first time, and they paid off $19.14M in long-term debt. As stated previously, this was Workhorse’s first time reporting a positive net income on their yearly statement, this could show investors that they have turned around the business, and if they continue this performance in the future, then it will solidify this belief and attract investors.

· **Social Sentiment:** According to [Utradea’s Reddit Tab](https://utradea.com/feed), Workhorse is the 4th most trending stock (in the past 24 hours) and the 9th most tending stock (in the past 48 hours) on Wall Street Bets and has an overall positive sentiment. We have seen the impact that Wall Street Bets has had on other trending stocks, so it will be interesting to see if Wall Street Bets can pump this stock for a quick return.

· **Short Squeeze Potential:** Currently, Workhorse has a short interest of 22%, which makes it a good candidate for s short squeeze. Furthermore, the short borrow rate (premium) for people/institutions to short Workhorse is at 11.91%, which can cause the shorts to have to cover quicker than usual. This stock has the potential to be squeezed, especially if Wall Street Bets takes an interest in it.

6/14/2021 10:09,stocks,Nope it's got nothing in the works after losing the USPS contract.  It's still overvalued
6/14/2021 11:39,stocks,Check out RIDE's CEO who used to be WKHS' CEO. And I once thought RIDE has better future than WKHS. edit: that CEO was terrible
6/14/2021 11:13,stocks,"This a joke questions? Workhorse is trash since they lost the USPS contract. Have they even accomplished anything worth talking about?   
Their joke gimmick drones and trucks with 60 mile range isn't cutting it."
6/14/2021 12:02,stocks,"Maybe at $8, but not right after it just went up 100% from nothing but just meme hype. ""After the dip"" was abouth month ago, you missed your boat."
6/14/2021 12:48,stocks,Whooooo this DD has got a downsides/risks section. Props to you OP
6/14/2021 11:18,stocks,"Once I see a stock being pumped by countless bots on WSB i automatically assume it's a pump and dump. This is one of them. Like others have said it's over valued but in my eyes....value means nothing in this current stock market. It's worth a punt based on it being a gamble that could pay off just from the amount of bots trying to pump it. Might not be the worse shout to have some stock but be ready to sell it early.  Seems risky to me but all the meme stocks have so much potential for easy money because so many other people are willing to bag hold for imaginary 1000% returns. 

When  I think of this stock I don't think of short squeeze potential, profits, growth etc....I just think....can I get in and out of this stock before it gets dumped. Seems a bit high for me to jump in on but for a bigger gambler its worth a pop."
6/14/2021 14:55,stocks,No it’s just a citadel pump and dump
6/14/2021 19:29,stocks,"Kinda off topic but I can't imagine any skilled/ knowledgeable engineer coming out of a prestigious school and thinking ""hmmm I should definitely move and work in a declining city like Cincinnati. All of these companies with huge goals are competing over the same scarce workforce . I don't see how this company will attract the labor they will need for these massive visions"
6/14/2021 11:09,stocks,"As someone who was super high on WKHS at IPO and held until shares dipped to $8 - no. It’s a PND right now. Their only plan was the USPS contract. Every logistics company could crush them if they decided to use drone delivery. They also own (I think) 10% of RIDE, which already came out saying it doesn’t have the funding to commercially produce vehicles. 

Avoid WKHS."
6/14/2021 18:23,stocks,"If it weren't one of the ""short squeeze candidates"" being pushed by OBVIOUS HF accounts on WSB I might have given it a second look. I'm actually a big fan of innovation and ground+air delivery makes sense if it's electric and autonomous. Anyhow  I digress...

That place is so overrun by HFs right now that I wouldn't touch anything that trends there."
6/14/2021 11:27,stocks,"Avoid $WKHS and checkout $ARVL instead. They have a contract, and investment, from UPS for 10,000 vehicles with a UPS option for another 10,000. First 10k to be delivered by 2024. Company uses a micro-factory setup which, in theory, seems great and would love to see how it plays out. Would make their ability to scale quickly if the 6 month build under $50m costs are accurate.

IMO much better play in the medium-term, but still has huge risk as they haven't delivered anything, yet."
6/14/2021 9:35,stocks,Better hurry
6/14/2021 10:01,stocks,Thank you for the thorough analysis

6/14/2021 16:15,stocks,Ride and WKHS are trash companies. I’ll change my opinion when their cashflow and profits justify their stock prices. Their revenues are non-existent

6/14/2021 18:44,stocks,"WKHS has always been hot garbage, no good vehicles, and one dicey contract. I'll probably buy puts tomorrow."

6/14/2021 15:00,stocks,Extremally overvalued
6/14/2021 10:48,stocks,Is that contract officially off the table? I was seeing things a few weeks/months ago that nothing was final and the new administration might have different feelings about the final bidding
6/14/2021 10:11,stocks,"I think that their HorseFly Drones themselves present a fantastic opportunity for Workhorse to grow, as they can license these drones out to major shipping companies and generate revenue through that stream"

6/14/2021 11:56,stocks,Steve Burns? If so I will check it out!
6/14/2021 13:09,stocks,60 mile range? Who thought that would be enough for a deliver vehicle lol
6/14/2021 12:16,stocks,"It is still trending on reddit, but I do think that it is a bit late, however there is still the potential to make a good return quickly."
6/14/2021 13:32,stocks,Thanks! I like to include both sides of the argument so people can be informed of everything (not just the good).
6/14/2021 11:20,stocks,"Fully agree where you are coming from, and if it does get pumped I would advise getting out as there are other long-term plays that will pan out better than WKHS"
6/14/2021 13:10,stocks,That’s exactly how I see it. Has some potential to make me money with the volatility but in no way is it a hold
6/14/2021 10:05,stocks,"No problem, I already did it for myself, however why not share it with everybody!"
6/14/2021 10:51,stocks,"It's been off the table. Not a bidding issue at all, workhorse could only offer short range EV which doesn't work well for most of the postal service routes, And was awarded during the current administration.  The only lawmakers objecting to the contract are tied to workhorse."
6/14/2021 10:13,stocks,And yet nobody is buying them.  Logistically drones are a nightmare.
6/14/2021 13:08,stocks,Major companies are already testing/using drones. UPS has done it for a few years and so has Amazon. I believe Amazon is also manufacturing their own.

6/14/2021 16:18,stocks,Steve Burns resigned
6/14/2021 12:33,stocks,"Not every stock trending on reddit will always keep shooting up. Not every meme stock is a quick 100% return. WSB is not a good example to follow, they're all down celebrating 90% losses most of the time and proud of it, then they have their month or two where everyone's up an insane amount and then they quickly lose it all again. You're just trying to chase hype"
6/14/2021 13:30,stocks,"I fully agree with you on the fact that they are not typically the ""brightest"" individuals, however the impacts that they have had on certain stocks cannot be discounted."
6/14/2021 17:05,stocks,"Their impact is hype, thats it. Hype usually doesnt do too well in the market long term. Hype and volume alone aren't enough to be good investments. WKHS is an awful investment being shot up by hype and unrealistic buying volume due to meme. 

I don't think WSB has any real affect on stocks, it's mostly manipulation from larger investors. Shorting a stock makes is highly volatile, the more short it is the more volatile. All WSB does is capitalize off the volatility on green days, but 99% of the time they're losing money not making it. You're just seeing that 1% right now and FOMOing. Without these ridiculous short positions on all these stocks, WSB would have no power. They just attack volatile plays. That's their entire strategy.

'High short interest + High volume = moon'. That's their thesis. Stock market isn't that simple"

6/14/2021 11:44,stocks,"I currently have them as barely a sell rating. After reviewing their 2020 AR I noticed a lack of cash to cover a substantial hardship, and even though they've beaten earnings 5 of the last 8 quarters, they've also lost money in 3 of the last 8 quarters. Trading at a negative P/E while the sector historically trades at 32.2 P/E doesn't help when comparing to the competition, either.

For less involved ratings, their equity score is 1.9 with 1 Buy, 4 neutral, and 2 sell ratings.

If they have a solid earnings for the upcoming quarter they could possibly become a BUY rating again if their P/E stays under the sector 5-yr P/E. I personally will not buy until they have 2 consecutive quarters of earnings growth, along with a substantial increase in their cash."

6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"Morning Update for Monday, 06/14/21 Good morning everyone! It's Monday, and I hope you had a nice weekend.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* CRSR: Gapping up above relevant SMA's. Room for further upwards movement, but I'll wait for things to settle after open. Possible support at 36 on the daily chart.
* NVAX: Possible resistance levels at 230 and 240, I'll watch for upwards movement if it can hold over 230. 
* COIN: Key resistance level right around 230. I'll be watching for the break over 230 for an opportunity to go long.
* TSLA: Seems to be holding up over the SMA(200), SMA(20), and SMA(9), after hovering around that level the past few days of trading. Could be a sign of more upwards movement, and a move up towards the SMA(50) in the near future. Possible resistance around 635 on the daily chart. 
* ITOS: Will be interesting to observe price action around the 30 level. Could fill the gap (or at least partially fill) to the downside if it breaks below 30, if it holds up, there could be more upwards movement.

Gapping DOWN:

* UPST: Possible support around 120 on the daily chart. If it can't hold above that level, it could provide some shorting opportunities.
* MRNA: Still holding above relevant SMA (SMA(9)) at the moment. If it fails to fill the gap to the upside, it could be worth a look as a short down to 210.
* RIDE: Gapping down below relevant SMA's. I'll be watching price action around the 10.00 level.
* BZ: Lots of room for downwards movement after the massive gap up on Friday. Could also see some continued momentum, so it'll be worth keeping an eye on. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open a bit higher after we saw some strength to end last week. The Fed has signaled that it intends to ease its asset purchase program at some point in the coming future. It will be interesting to see if this has an immediate effect on the market. SPY is trading a bit over 424, and will likely set a new intraday ATH. Maybe we will see some choppiness up at these levels, but I'm optimistic we'll see more strength. DIA is trading just under 345. I'll be watching price action around 343.50, if it breaks down below it could see more downwards movement. Tech stocks are continuing their strength, and QQQ could see a push to new ATH this week (currently trading just below 342). Gold and silver are down a decent amount this morning, while crude oil is up a bit. Bitcoin is currently trading around 39,300, and seems to have flipped the bearish narrative. I'm more bullish if it can get up above 39,500 and hold up. Crypto-related stocks are up quite a bit in premarket trading, as a result. Marijuana stocks are up a bit in premarket, but nothing too significant. Still worth keeping an eye on them for potential upcoming catalysts. Meme stocks are showing some revival this mornin, and are always worth following.

I'm optimistic we'll see strength today, but stay disciplined in your trades, and let's start the week off right.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)"
6/14/2021 9:03,stocks,Good morning. Here's to growth
6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"Corsair DD and why it is a growth company in a growth industry **Gaming Market**

The gaming market is a strong growing market that has been expanding for the past two decades and is expected to keep growing. Consumer spending in 2020 on PC gaming hardware and accessories reach 4.5 billion USD while accessories [grew 81% YoY and hardware grew 57%.](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-16-pc-hardware-and-accessories-spending-grew-62-percent-in-the-us-in-2020)

Corsair manufactures hardware solutions such as fans, RAM, cooling units, PC cases and many more that have profited from the recent increase in PC hardware sales. Due to lockdowns many have been wanting to buy a PC which has shot up sales. However, this trend is not temporary as I will show.

[Steam users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/308330/number-stream-users/) a.k.a. any gamer who has a PC and play video games, have seen a very sharp growth in the past year due to the lockdown. The trend fluctuates with the lockdowns easings around the world and is always and bottom in summer months. From August 2019 to August 2020 there has been a 33% increase in steam users. August of 2020 was a time when Europe had record low covid infections (compared to winter months and beginning of pandemic) as well as America. Yet people were still playing video games at record rates. This is a clear sign that this market has grown, and the player base is hooked and not going anywhere. Since then, it had another 20% increase. Bullish af.

The biggest nonsense I have ever heard is that now that lockdown is over, gamers are going to stop gaming. Have they ever even met a gamer? Personally, I was a hardcore gamer before lockdown, and I will definitely continue to be one. The lockdown accelerated the uptake of gaming and if anything, people will be more committed to gaming. Easing of lockdown would allow for social events (e.g. LAN parties and gaming conventions) to take place that will further encourage spending on gaming products.

Investors who believe that gaming is going to fade out or that the hype is over are completely in the wrong here. Covid has only accelerated the trend and there might be a minor pullback in numbers as usually happens in the summer months, but the YoY numbers indicate that there has been a strong increase in gaming and this trend is likely to continue. You can buy the stock now at a lucrative price and when the investors realize that gaming is here to stay, they will have to buy the stock at a much higher price down the line.

**Streaming Market**

An excellent acquisition by Corsair has been buying Elgato and entering the streaming business. The streaming market was 50 billion USD in 2020 and is expected to reach 59 billion USD in 2021. It is expected to continue growing to 2028 at an [annual CAGR rate of 21%!!!](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-streaming-market#:~:text=The%20global%20video%20streaming%20market%20size%20was%20estimated%20at%20USD,USD%2059.14%20billion%20in%202021.&text=The%20global%20video%20streaming%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20grow%20at,USD%20223.98%20billion%20by%202028)

This is a huge market with a wonderful growth rate (not easy finding a market with such a growth rate) and corsair is perfectly positioned to take advantage of it. From buying the hardware to run your PC (also with products such as the capture card) to the elgato streaming deck that allows for easy streaming controls, Corsair is in the perfect position to take advantage of this growing market and be at the forefront of the hardware space.

**Financial performance**

Absolutely solid financial performance over the past year with stellar growth and very prospective in the future.

YoY revenue and profit margins have been growing at double digit rates. Revenue grew 55% and 65% from 1,163 and 1,300 to 1,702 and 1,923 million USD from Dec 2019 and March 2020 to Dec 2020 and March 2021. Q1 is usually the worst quarter of the year but they managed to get their best ever quarter!

EBITDA margins and Net Income margins have gone from around 6.5% and 0% to 13.5 and 7.7% from March 2020 to March 2021, respectively. This is showing stunning increase in operating margins which are very healthy and promise great further investment and growth.

EPS this year is expected to be 1.81. However, the CFO is usually very conservative and it could be much higher by the end of the year. (I could go on more detail about earnings growth but in this case margins are more interesting because it shows better efficiency and last year they were barely doing a profit so the earnings growth is skewed). With an EPS of 1.81 a fair value PE multiple of 20 would be 36.2. However, if you consider this is a growth stock in a growth environment, then comparable growth companies trade at 30-40 PE ratio which would indicate a price target of at least 54.3-72.4!

Additionally, they have been paying down debt from 505 million at end of the year 2019 to 321 million in 2020.

**Comparing Corsair with its closest competitor: Logitech**

Lets look at Logitech valuation metrics:

&#x200B;

||Last 12 months|Next 12 months|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio|23.4|30.1|
|EV/Sales|3.8|3.8|
|EV/EBITDA|15.9|22.6|

Corsair:

&#x200B;

||Last 12 months|Next 12 months|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio|20.4|18.8|
|EV/Sales|1.71|1.5|
|EV/EBITDA|11.5|12.9|

&#x200B;

Now if Corsair was priced as Logitech, it would indicate a price increase between 50-100%.

Additionally, much of Logitech’s offering has been focussed on working from home products, whereas Corsair is more focussed on gaming (Logitech too but not to the same extent). The working from home trend has peaked and many companies like JP Morgan have announced that they will want all their staff to return back to the office within the next months. There will still be people working from home but the trend will be declining from now.

**Ownership**

There has been negative sentiment around IPOs recently as many of them have flooded the market resulting in extreme short term price movement which has led to investors staying shy of them and believing that they are more speculative. Ownership currently sits at 62% with eagle tree capital and around 10% with other institutions.

Short interest is currently at around 19% of the float.

Overall, great company with excellent financial performance (actually makes a great profit and has super good growth ahead) and I am mega bullish on them. They also have super low valuation metrics which together make a rare combination.

**TL;DR**. Great company, great products, growing market and growing company. Super low valuations

&#x200B;

Edit: if you have any comments or feedback, please let me know.   
It is currently being driven up like crazy, but this company does have excellent value in the long term. Something to consider"
6/14/2021 12:39,stocks,"This is not a DD. This is a masturbatory bull case circle jerk. A DD needs downsides 


full disclosure: Own the stock, and up on the stock as of today"
6/14/2021 9:04,stocks,"All the bagholders at +40$ be ""Fucking finally"".

Very happy that I cost averaged at 32$ after the earnings. The fundamentals are incredibly strong."
6/14/2021 9:55,stocks,All of a sudden I’m seeing I’m seeing tons of CRSR posts. Who’s behind this?
6/14/2021 8:52,stocks,You are not investing in the company if you buy while its up 32% on just hype. Wait until the pumpers quit and get back in at 35$ or below. I agree that it was undervalued but buying now is just chasing
6/14/2021 13:31,stocks,"For what it's worth, I've seen a huge increase in Corsair gaming products in my country. A lot of my friends bought some Corsair gear and are very satisfied with it.

They see it as a low-cost brand with great quality. In other words, the relation between price and quality is very nice.

I definitely see it growing in time, because it's still an unknown brand to most people, at least here.

I'm not invested in it, in case you're wondering. Just my 2 cents based on my personal perspective and gaming circle. I have no idea if they price already reflects the future growth or not."
6/14/2021 15:42,stocks,Artificially pumped by WSB. Trimmed my position and will buy back at $31 after it dumps.
6/14/2021 10:04,stocks,"Going against the grain here but I’ll name a few counters:
1) 2020 was an unusual year where many gamers decided to upgrade their PCs, that’s prob why the growth rate was super high.
2) The gaming hardware industry is extremely price competitive with low barriers to entry. You can see it’s not just Corsair, logitech, Kingston and others are all fighting for market share.
3) Very little pricing power - Corsair is a price taker not setter. 
4) low product differentiation - a battery is a battery, a case is a case, a keyboard is a keyboard."
6/14/2021 10:23,stocks,The thing that's kept me away from companies like this is absolutely no moat.  Gamers aren't brand loyal - they're not going to stick with Corsair components just because they love Corsair if something better comes along.
6/14/2021 12:52,stocks,Classic dd once the company pumps to pump it even more.
6/14/2021 10:58,stocks,I was going to buy CRSR this morning but not doing to pay 35+ for it...
6/14/2021 14:36,stocks,"I think you should compare a lot more factors with Logitech than those. I think Logitech has higher margins and returns and less debt, but Corsair has grown sales significantly in the past 6 months so it is a little undervalued."
6/14/2021 12:55,stocks,"We over at WSB posted DD on this.

I wonder if this is why it pumped today"
6/14/2021 17:59,stocks,care to explain why people want to short it/bear case?
6/14/2021 11:26,stocks,"Well I was going to invest when it was <32, but I'm just going to go with Baba now..."
6/14/2021 11:28,stocks,"I have a position in Corsair because I didn't mind the valuation in the low 30s, and their financials were pretty good. 

HOWEVER, Corsair is not an aggressive growth company based on analysis estimates. All of their projected growth rates are ok but not spectacular and I think it's important to have reasonable expectations. 
Personally I see Corsair as a GARP investment."
6/14/2021 13:04,stocks,Thanks for the pump. I just got rid of my big fat Corsair bags I held for month.
6/14/2021 14:52,stocks,"Down 53% with them.

Lesson learned: dont trust stock youtubers lmao"
6/14/2021 15:47,stocks,"I sold today, but will be back once it hits under 35"
6/14/2021 16:28,stocks,Thanks for pumping this morning I was able to sell at +30% on my investment for a solid gain!
6/14/2021 16:25,stocks,"Wtf I didn't expect the stock to go up so much today. Wasn't even expecting anything today so I hadn't looked until now. But hey, bought at $32 so I take it."
6/14/2021 16:37,stocks,"I've been holding CRSR for months, I am worried everyone jumping on it is going to fuck me now"
6/14/2021 11:25,stocks,Corsair is not a great company.   Covid and work from home drove revenue last year.  All similar companies saw revenue go up without any changes to their business model.  There are too many companies that offer similar products.  This is a pump n dump stock that will not provide anything except bag holders.
6/14/2021 15:36,stocks,"From a consumer stand point, Corsair products aren’t that great. Most of their products aren’t top of the line. When you think of power supply, you think of evga, when you think of rams, you think of gskills, when you think of cases, you think of nzxt, lian li, when you think of keyboards, mouse and etc you think of Logitech, cool master, glorious and etc. I have used many of their products over the years and not really impressed with any."
6/14/2021 15:59,stocks,Up 11.21% today so I'm glad I bought them last Monday.  Jon Najarian  on CNBC just said this one has room to run.
6/14/2021 16:20,stocks,"I have to say this is very true. Lots of subjective opinion in there too. Things like:

I own the shares and I like the stock but this isn't great DD."

6/14/2021 9:15,stocks,"Was actually waiting for my next deposit coming friday to buy into corsair, been eyeballing it since a bit. Guess I'll wait till the pump & dump is over.."
6/14/2021 8:59,stocks,Do you know what's happening with it right now? I checked this morning and suddenly it's up ~30%... Is it being pumped by the meme stock crowd or something?
6/14/2021 16:21,stocks,Sold at 39 and bought back in at 36 - comfortable with that to be honest.
6/14/2021 17:37,stocks,Sell puts
6/14/2021 9:25,stocks,I got in at $35 during pre-market lol
6/14/2021 9:05,stocks,"It has definitely gone up like crazy today. Either way once the dust settles, it is a financially solid company without questions. In the short it can be sporadic but in the long term, it definitely has value. I bought in at 31 and have been a bag holder for quite some time. Play this how you want and perhaps keep it on your radar to see what happens"
6/14/2021 17:21,stocks,lol closed at 36. the pump is already done.
6/14/2021 18:25,stocks,Yeah I had a sell order for 42$ that didn't fill. Guess I got too greedy.. either way still holding at an average of 34$ not too concerned about it.
6/14/2021 10:16,stocks,"some good points.   
1) as I mentioned that this sudden trend is likely to continue. Also many people still waiting for the opportunity to buy graphics card. If they go back in the market they will continue buying CRSR products.   
Points 2 and 3 kind of similar. So I agree with you it is a competitive market, but if you look at customer satisfaction, corsair has a lot of loyalty and very satisfied customers. Good brand recognition and perspective is even more valuable here.   
4) thats an over generalization IMO. An electric car is not any electric car e.g. tesla is not the same as volkswagen for example. Corsair also has entered the streaming platform with elgato so that is another industry. For many enthusiasts, Corsair products provide excellent customization that they want"
6/14/2021 11:25,stocks,"yeah, but that's Corsair's moat. It's the company with products of the highest quality. Once a gamer uses their products it will be difficult for them to adjust downwards in term of quality. It's building an Apple-like reputation in terms of quality and performance (okay, not quite like Apple, but you get the point)"
6/14/2021 18:57,stocks,Samesies
6/14/2021 17:38,stocks,LOGI’s strong YoY net profit margin is largely due to a tax adjustment that will reverse out over 10 years
6/14/2021 18:25,stocks,"It could be that the shorts are holding it from much higher prices like 50 area. Additionally, the biggest bear case is that some people believe that post lock down they will not do as well. So this increase in revenue and profits is temporary. (though I personally doubt it as you could gather from my post and they said they still had high demand and not enough supply on many products). These are only my opinions, make sure you yourself know the company and what price you are willing to invest in :)"
6/14/2021 15:01,stocks,It's up huge today lmao wtf
6/14/2021 16:33,stocks,You won't have to wait long
6/14/2021 12:04,stocks,3B market cap with 2B revenue guidance for 2021. It’s clear Covid boosted 2020 numbers but they also are showing that they will continue to grow revenue and profits.
6/14/2021 17:40,stocks,"Uhhh I don’t think of those cases, keyboards or mouses. Cases sure but I don’t think of nzxt. Keyboard and mouses for sureeeee as hell don’t think of Logitech. Corsair has one of the best keyboards on the market with the K95 and the M65 mouse. Those alone are still in the upper tier in my opinion."
6/14/2021 11:53,stocks,Yeah about what I'm at as well. The great thing about run-ups like this on companies you're long on is that you get to sell covered calls far oom at a huge premium to lower your cost basis.
6/14/2021 17:26,stocks,I bought a little mousepad for my computer and it's really nice. Wish my desk was big enough for the led one they have though.
6/14/2021 18:48,stocks,They got me with the power supplies. You start appreciating good quality PS when your PC starts randomly turning off and when it decides to burn your MB.
6/14/2021 14:54,stocks,Yep. Wsb pump and dump and these bots have flooded r/stocks too. It's similar to pltr.
6/14/2021 16:32,stocks,Hold
6/14/2021 9:02,stocks,"A bunch of people posted DD's to WSB on Thursday/Friday. You could see the launch starting on Friday, when near market close the price jumped $1 from $31.50 to $32.50.

Personally I love the company and think it's getting to the price that it's fairly valued at, but it'll probably dump and head back to around $34/35 eventually in the next couple of days if not sometime today.

I'm planning to close out my put and write a CC to take advantage of the increased IV that should happen today."
6/14/2021 9:01,stocks,"I had 142 at 31,2€ and just sold for a few hundred profit, will buy in back when its back to normal lol. long term it should be still pretty solid stock."
6/14/2021 10:19,stocks,Can’t tell if it’s a coincidence that multiple ppl are posting Corsair dd today and the stock jumping 18% today. Seems fishy
6/14/2021 15:32,stocks,">	It’s the company with products of the highest quality.

Except they aren’t. Logitech makes better mice and headsets, noctua makes better fans, many companies make better storage and RAM, their controller market is extremely niche and isn’t going to take controller market share from Sony or MS."
6/14/2021 11:45,stocks,"That's not a moat, it just means they're the leaders at the moment.  What's to stop another company from starting up and making even better components?

There aren't any switching costs either.  It's not like once you're a Corsair customer it is very difficult to leave their ecosystem.  If a gamer decides its time to build/upgrade a setup, he/she will look for the best quality at the best price."
6/14/2021 12:46,stocks,">yeah, but that's Corsair's moat.

LMAO"
6/14/2021 18:18,stocks,"Sorry but this is bullshit. I've been a gamer for well over 2 decades and Corsair is *nothing special*. They don't have a cult following, they don't have a reputation for superior quality or products and anyone claiming otherwise is pumping. Their stuff is okay, not the best not crap. I've not seen a single gamer do a dedicated corsair build much less promote one."

6/14/2021 13:01,stocks,"You couldn't be more wrong. A moat is a barrier to entry preventing competitors from entering the space and/or selling products or services more competitively.

I sure do love my Corsair PSU but if Fractal Design offers 20% discount one weekend I'm going there. In fact I don't know any gamers who go ""all Corsair"" or ""All Razer"". Gamers are pragmatic when it comes to everything besides graphics cards (when lock-in becomes real) and often work off a limited budget."
6/14/2021 13:15,stocks,"They are, but you're looking at one year of green due to outside forces with no chanhes to their business model.  Corsair has been around since 1994.  They don't do anything unique or ground breaking. They are very much a follower company that has struggled financially for years."
6/14/2021 13:16,stocks,Corsair has been around for 25+ years. They are definitely not next big thing. It’s a COVID stock with some immediate upsides.

6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"Quick discussion around US Inflation Alright, let's talk a bit more about US inflation.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strategists-still-dont-think-inflation-is-a-problem-for-stocks-morning-brief-100322032.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strategists-still-dont-think-inflation-is-a-problem-for-stocks-morning-brief-100322032.html)

So, they keep talking about the 10-year US bond yield as a signal that the market has ""shrugged off"" inflation concerns. Has it though? It has gone down, yes. But maybe, just maybe, it is because the Fed is doing everything they can to keep bond yields low? Up until last month, the Fed expectation was that rates would be hiked up in late 2021-mid-2022. Now, the expectation is 2023. Remember, low interest rates tend to lead to high inflation (low interest makes savings and bonds worthless). Also, actual inflation continues to beat Fed expectations every month. For April, the Fed expected 3.6%. They got 4.2%. For May, they expected 4.7%. They got 5%! They keep revising their expectations up and up and up. If inflation was a stock, I would buy it!

So, when was the last time it was this high? June to September of 2009. **12 years ago**. Inflation also steadily increased then, it did not spike. Before that? May 1991 which followed a year of sustained inflation over 5%. **30 years ago**. I know that the Fed keeps saying that we've had weird circumstances, but it's not like we've had negative inflation at any point since March 2020 so... what are you on about, Fed?

Granted, we've only had 1 month of 5% inflation. For now. However, we also have:

* $120bln that the Fed is pumping into the economy every month.
* the $500bln in its reverse repo (money that's been essentially been taken OUT of circulation).
* almost 0% interest rates, which will not be lifted until 2023 (current expectation).
* commodity prices rising across the board due to shortages.
* rising labour costs and record job vacancies because people make more money staying at home than working.
* an increasing government spending.
* the housing markets across the world at an all-time high.

Should I keep going?

Hope that gives you a good idea where we stand right now with inflation! I really want to hear your opinion on this :)"
6/14/2021 11:36,stocks,"It wouldn't affect my holding decisions one way or another, but I believe the fed about this inflation being transitory. The bond market also seems to agree with me, as long term yields have been coming down for 3 months. The 5% core CPI reflects extreme comps from a year ago - the money markets didn't even flinch when that number printed. Those numbers are more like 2.5% if you comp to 2019 numbers.

Our economy and buying power are completely shot, along with the bond market. The only way you can even try to keep up is with equities.

6/14/2021 9:17,stocks,"Everything you’ve listed is either directly deflationary or signals transient inflation. Sustainable, across the board inflation can only happen if we either see a permanent expansion of the money supply or full employment.

Obviously we don’t have the second.

To the first, the Fed has no idea how much money there is, nor can they create permanent money except in the event of bank runs. What they do create is bank reserves, which operate as a clearing house cash equivalent within the confines of the financial sector. People want to say this is equivalent to cash, but it simply isn’t. This money lives at the Fed, and can only be traded to other banks or used to write loans against. If thats not enough for you, Japan has led the way in QE and has only seen very low inflation or deflation despite it.

But they can just make loans against the reserves, right? Well, they’re not making many loans since 2008, which is born out in the money velocity sharply decreasing since the same time. The banks are worried about *deflation*, like we saw in 2008, and refuse to be on the hook if it happens again.

Look, the idea of inflation coming in and punishing the excesses of government is a super desirable idea. I bought silver in 2009 after buying into the same logic, and prices still haven’t recovered to what I bought it at. The fact of the matter is government and public debt are two giant deflation bombs that will swallow our economy unless we see more and more debt growth. And all the banks are standing by and waiting for this to happen since they don’t want to be on the hook, while the government launches program after program to try and inject money into the economy to stave off **deflation**.

The only thing I don’t know is how long does this game last. It could end this year. Or the treasury and the Fed could spin this along for another 5. Either way I’m all in betting long end interest rates (10Y, 30Y) are going to 0."

If that wasn't the case, then they are simply incompetent and, again, we shouldn't be listening to them IMO). Plus, even Ray Dalio says it, if the government comes out and says ""Don't worry, we'll support a strong dollar"", the next thing you can expect is a devaluation of the dollar. The Fed is trying extremely hard to control this narrative of transitory inflation and I don't believe them. Obviously, I could be wrong, but it's really hard to think of transitory inflation when there are so many inflation indicators spiking.

Also, I know that everyone is talking about extreme measure last year, but at least price-wise (and therefore inflation-wise), there were no massive changes! Apart from oil, I guess, but that's a tiny bit of the inflation index. Food prices spiked last year, but now they continue to rise. Housing prices are hitting ATH, etc. Obviously it could be a temporary bottleneck, but the Fed seems to downplay everything even when the stats are way worse that they make them out to be. I guess they want to avoid panic in the markets, but when the hell did it become their priority to look after the markets? it's just a weird situation and from what I'm seeing in the stats and so on, everything is leaning towards prolonged high inflation, e.g. 5% or more.

I guess we'll see next month and the month after. There's really nothing we can do apart from speculation until we see the actual number :)

You're right though, it's hard to see what this changes. I'm also long stocks, but I've switched more and more towards value and commodity producers to benefit from inflation. I think some of these hyped up growth stocks will plunge in the next few months.

I'm sure everyone here has seen this chart a 100 times, but the M2 Money Supply is growing exponentially! [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)

There is hardly any chance of seeing bank runs! In fact, the banks are overflowing with money! The Fed's overnight reserve repo which has just gone past half a trillion is where **banks put excess money**. Essentially, the banks give the Fed a 15-day loan for a minimal return and they can only do that right now because of the minimum capital requirements introduced in the wake of the GFC. Nothing else has such low capital requirements as lending money to the Fed.

How are rising labour costs deflationary? Rising salaries equal higher spending equal higher prices, e.g. inflation.

Plus, we're seeing continued upticks in commodity prices around the world.

You're right, Japan's QE has had a different result, but Japan is not the US. The yen is not the global reserve currency. What the Japanese government does has much less impact than the US government, IMO. Plus, we've seen the amount of investors talking about inflation. Even Warren Buffett said it was worrying and he is usually nonchalant about macroeconomic factors.

You're long interest rates so you must be long inflation, right? I was also looking at the Fed's inflation expectations (not that they are a reliable measure given everything that we've seen recently) and they are spiking!

Secondly, people are getting more money in unemployment benefits than working some jobs which is putting pressure on employers - that was one of my points. To cope with that, they need to raise salaries. There was an in-depth interview about this which I watched on Friday. Some employers are PAYING people to go to interviews! Teen employment is the highest since WW2 because they are cheap labour. Wages are not up significantly... Yet. But they will be. So will inflation.

Edit: link - https://www.cbsnews.com/news/teen-employment-summer-best-1953/

""One reason for the turnaround could be due to higher pay, with companies bumping up entry-level wages to attract job applicants. Wages for teens in service-sector jobs have increased 8% in the last two months alone, according to an analysis from Gusto of small businesses that use its payroll services. For instance, jobs for teens working in tourism have increased from about $9.30 an hour in March to $13.50 in May, Gusto found."""
6/14/2021 12:06,stocks,"The FedGov hasn’t altered its policy with the money printer. They fund their expenses by selling bonds.

The M metrics aren’t an accurate measure of the money supply. It isn’t very clear what money even is, as international banks have taken to using derivatives, treasuries, some securities as cash equivalents. The M metrics are wholly insufficient at determining the actual quantity, or how that quantity affects prices.

Labor costs can rise for a number of reasons. It is only inflationary when we reach full employment, which we are woefully short of right now. I imagine wages will come back down once the extra unemployment benefits expire, as businesses now have to have their wages compete with doing nothing.

PPI (producer price index) is actually not correlated with CPI very much. Breakdowns in supply chains and increasing transportation costs, which is underlying a lot of the producing costs right now, will be gone once/if production ramps back up and backlogs are cleared. It’s not the same thing as monetary inflation, where equal quantity goods are being bid up by more dollars. We just have less goods at the moment. 

My point about Japan is how banks interact with reserves. A pivotal step in the stimulus process of QE is that banks lend against these newfound reserves, which they are refusing to do in both Japan and the US. Inflation fear is nothing new, it has happened at least 4 times since I got burned: 2009, 2012, 2018, and now. This too shall pass, and interest rates will continue falling to 0.

I’m long bond prices, which means I’m short interest rates. 

The Fed has never been able to reach their inflation expectation targets, and the base effects of last year as well as the semiconductor shortage are chief contributors to the May CPI being high. Both of which are transitory.

Edit: I should clarify I do think we’ll see inflation, but we’ll see it right after deflation comes in and wipes everyone out and the government is forced to start monetizing the debt. Until that happens, sustained inflation is the Fed’s wet dream. It corresponds to a healthy and growing economy, and all I see is debt fueled asset bubbles, increasing government dependency and lawyering."

>The causes were different, obviously, but the results were similar. High unemployment, lots of extra government debt, lowering of interest rates, etc.

Doesn't matter what the causes were, what matters is how the government handled it and what happened after.

And still, **still**, despite all of the **deflationary** indicators in the wake of the GFC, we saw an inflation spike of **5%** lasting over 4-5-6 months. **The biggest in 20 years**. What was common between then and now though? Again, like I mentioned in my previous answer, we've got 2 main things:

1. Massive government spending (stimulus) - back then it was $700bln, a record high, now we've got... what... $2bln? More? 3 times the biggest bailout in US history? That is definitely a deflationary sign. I cannot see how this will affect inflation *at all*.
2. Lowering of interest rates - this time, they're at almost 0%, nowhere else to go

Combine that with other inflationary factors that were not present back in 2008 and we can see that a long-term higher-than-average inflation is possible.

6/14/2021 12:07,stocks,Good. More room for HYLN
6/14/2021 12:42,stocks,Not good news for ride!🤷😳
6/14/2021 9:17,stocks,Check out r/lordstownmotors
6/14/2021 7:52,stocks,More than one guy. They always try to make you feel like an idiot who cannot see glorious future until the company implodes... Of course then its because markets are a casino and HF manipulated lader attack yada yada.
6/14/2021 9:13,stocks,Lol was just thinking that. He refused to listen to any reasons that weren’t supportive of a bull case and blamed “the media” and Hindenburg.
6/14/2021 8:55,stocks,"Guy has 10,000 shares. RIP.

I don't know why of all the stocks on the market you choose to hitch yourself on RIDE."
6/14/2021 9:21,stocks,I actually thought of him when I saw the news break out…the guy asked for an honest discussion but was just chasing confirmation bias.
6/14/2021 10:21,stocks,u/SmackEh
6/14/2021 9:22,stocks,"Lol, “nobody liked those guys anyway,” “this is bullish.”

6/14/2021 8:20,stocks,Lol he's still arguing that this is a good thing and is even more Bullish on RIDE...  The desperation is palpable.
6/14/2021 9:05,stocks,He was so deluded😂
6/14/2021 9:32,stocks,Saw the news and came here looking for him lol. I told him to get out while he still could and he did not want to listen to anybody
6/14/2021 11:08,stocks,"No, no, no you don’t understand. EVERYTHING that happens is good, RIDE is great, no issues at all, now let me spin EVERY SINGLE THING positively so I sound smart, and honest."
6/14/2021 11:09,stocks,Calling u/SmackEh
6/14/2021 18:29,stocks,"That was funny. 

Honest discussion... Give him a negative fact and he attacks you 🤣"
6/14/2021 11:17,stocks,"Hi guys.

You may want to check LMC's investors relations page. They've provided an official response to the Hindenburg short report : [https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-results-special-committee-investigation](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-results-special-committee-investigation)

Now that Burns ""the fraudster"" that everyone hates has been voted off the island, and the Hindenburg is debunked you guys are all bullish on this stock now 🤣"
6/14/2021 10:05,stocks,He said it was going to triple
6/14/2021 8:10,stocks,"and the second time they tried to enter the truck in a race it broke down after 40 miles hahaha

and also it turns out they have no actual oem. theyre just mishmashing parts from various companies into a dogshit pile of a ""truck"""
6/14/2021 8:06,stocks,"Yes. And everyone shit on Hindenburg because they are short sellers so obviously they must be lying and nothing they have said is true, its all just to kill share price..."
6/14/2021 8:38,stocks,funny part is if you go on youtube there are people who are commenting that they are going to keep it and believe it is going to be $30+ by end of year
6/14/2021 15:56,stocks,there been a lot of pump and dump lately on shitty stocks. don't know what's up with that
6/14/2021 10:45,stocks,"This, the old school auto manufacturers will suck up every drop in the EV market Tesla doesn't just completely absorb. Why risk tons of money with an unproven **MANUFACTURER**. 

Yes let's drop 60k on a first iteration vehicle from a brand new company. Or we can buy a Tesla that has 15 yrs in the business and I see on the road everyday. Or if I'm a brand loyalist the gas car manufacturers have 70+yrs designing vehicles and are literally just replacing the engine in their designs with other minor tweaks.

The vast majority of these EV startups are trash starting with nikola and lordstown. Neither have a single manufacturing plant up and running."
6/14/2021 19:41,stocks,How do you feel about canoo? >.<
6/14/2021 12:12,stocks,"It's also disturbing to me how many redditors call TSLA a memestock. No, NKLA, RIDE, NIO, and Lucid are memestocks. Tesla is an established EV manufacturer and the only one we know will still be here in 10 years."
6/14/2021 15:54,stocks,it would be nice to have a website of known CEOS/CFOS which company they were a part of before it went belly up...Sort of like rate my teach combined with sexual predators but for CEOS

6/14/2021 17:33,stocks,NKLA is next
6/14/2021 10:29,stocks,They got 700m from spac deal... and they burned it all up it seem...
6/14/2021 15:36,stocks,"I’m still wondering how in the hell they spent all that $$$ (an easyyy 1mil+) on trying to race their lordstown motors truck in the BAJA 250, how in the hell they justified that in their minds, while knowing the company was basically a front and burning investors. I never invested, but when I saw them building that race vehicle that was to me, and should have been to everyone else a major red flag."
6/14/2021 9:36,stocks,No shares available to short. You could buy a long expiry put. I passed on the put a couple of weeks ago. The changing IV will make it a losing proposition if you buy to open a long put.
6/14/2021 15:45,stocks,"100%, look how they used funds to build their race truck haha."
6/14/2021 9:40,stocks,"The US is in a trade war with China. Politicians on both sides are banning investment in the other countries companies. Trump started the sabre rattling, and now Biden has followed through with a ban. It’s the unknown political risk that puts people off."
6/14/2021 14:46,stocks,"Don't short anything, you'll just get blown up by people targeting shorters once short% gets high enough"
6/14/2021 18:55,stocks,Fuck no. This one is going to zero.
6/14/2021 14:41,stocks,"The whole stock market can't turn into meme stocks. Despite all the liquidity available in retail investments, there isn't enough money to go around all the stocks."
6/14/2021 13:21,stocks,"Have you read the report? It literally refutes very few things. The only thing legit I saw was in regards to the frames being steel.

Everything else was either “it’s not a big deal “ or “we disclosed this”. The preorder thing they flat out admitted that statements made might not be accurate."
6/14/2021 10:43,stocks,It’s almost like there are reasons why the qualified investor rules exist
6/14/2021 9:33,stocks,Just went to check it out. They're trying to spin this as good news lol
6/14/2021 11:56,stocks,"Checked it out.  For some reason the song Blinded by the Light came to my mind.  There's a verse that goes:

*Blinded by the light*

*Revved up like a deuce*

*Another runner in the night*


For the longest time, when I was young, I thought it was douche, i.e. Revved up like a douche.  Seems to fit this situation."
6/14/2021 10:35,stocks,Jesus Christ. The company could get bankrupt and they still would see this as bullish.
6/14/2021 10:22,stocks,Any legit irrefutable argument against the company is met with “high risk high reward” counter argument.
6/14/2021 8:47,stocks,"nono, this is bullish! they can pay their next ceo/cfo less so the company will save money!

no, i don't care about actual car production, yknow what the fundamentals actually are, because ride will definitely do that (idk how but they definitely will). 

cash isn't a real concern, this is just hedge funds manipulating a perfectly good company"

6/14/2021 14:49,stocks,"GM has like 10% ownership....they seem easily scammed, first NKLA, and RIDE"
6/14/2021 9:04,stocks,"There’s a bull case for everything.  There was a time when sentiment on RIDE was very positive.  This is why I love stock market investing, because hard truths can still be told.  And your personal data filter is constantly tested and improved."
6/14/2021 12:18,stocks,"> hitch yourself a RIDE

I see what you did there."
6/14/2021 10:19,stocks,"Haha was reading that thread and wondering when it was going to blow up in his face. Turns out, literally the next day"
6/14/2021 11:18,stocks,The funny thing is he said yesterday that “the ceo was fine.”
6/14/2021 15:38,stocks,"It is, once a company loses all fundamentals it becomes a short target and then a momentum play and ceases to be an actual investment. 

This is positive for RIDE because it was never really a viable investment in the first place, and now with only a 1.6b market cap it's subject to massive short squeezes and easy profits from day trading. Even one big player can easily start the squeeze due to it's small cap."
6/14/2021 13:10,stocks,"Bruh, the best time to cut your losses was yesterday. The second best time is today."
6/14/2021 8:32,stocks,It’s a COTS truck? Is that even possible?
6/14/2021 15:41,stocks,"They dumped so much money in to the r&d in to that 100% one off race vehicle, not to mention the actual cost to build it. I guess their way to justify it mentally must have been, hey this company is going down in flames, investors are about to lose their ass, so fuck it let’s have some fun with all this raised capital? I never invested in this company, but have been around Baja racing all my life and when I saw them building this it was a MAJOR RED FLAG to me that this company was a total front. Missing date after date but putting the time in money in to a very very very complicated race program. Sure enough it held true, and their performance was just that - a disaster. Not sure if that was their last ditch PR stunt effort, but just throwing money at a truck doesn’t mean shit down there in a Baja race. You really need to know what you’re doing."

6/14/2021 10:49,stocks,"Your points are true, but EVs do provide a lower barrier to entry for manufacturers, and there are still untapped niche markets, like for example what Workhorse is doing since no one makes a proper EV delivery vehicle right now."
6/14/2021 12:01,stocks,"My NIO gains say otherwise. China is the new dominant economic power. They are incredibly protectionist, and represent about half the EV market on their own. No 15 year record of self-driving cars killing their passengers or bursting into flames that even a fire truck can’t extinguish. Musk is acting increasingly unstable, and talks more about crypto than his own vehicles. Even *Ford* beat Tesla to putting an EV truck on the market. The writing’s on the wall."
6/14/2021 16:23,stocks,People are pretty brand loyal when it comes to automobiles. It's not like that's just going to disappear with a few startups entering the game.
6/14/2021 11:53,stocks,"A lot of the EV startups don't even manufacturer their own EVs...

Nikola was going to have GM make their Badger truck. Last I heard they were still looking for a partner to manufacturer the Nikola One semi truck.

I'm 95% certain that NIO outsources their manufacturing to others as well from what I've read.

Even Apple is looking to outsource the production of their EVs to one of the traditional automakers, but has been having trouble finding one willing to do it according to what I've read in the leaks."
6/14/2021 19:53,stocks,"I wouldn't lump NIO in there. They actually do make cars that work, and their battery replacement model is actually really smart."
6/14/2021 15:57,stocks,🤔 that's a great idea
6/14/2021 17:40,stocks,That exists. It's called LinkedIn
6/14/2021 14:47,stocks,It's not. But enough people will short RIDE and then they can just get blown up for easy gains
6/14/2021 9:36,stocks,Lmao that subreddit can’t really handle facing facts. They still think it’s going to short squeeze 😂
6/14/2021 10:27,stocks,Dang it would be good if I had half of their optimism.
6/14/2021 14:15,stocks,"Well, getting rid of problems is good, but certainly the company has big issues now."
6/14/2021 10:49,stocks,I think some people don’t realize “high risk high reward“ means there is a high risk of no reward
6/14/2021 13:41,stocks,"""High risk, high reward"" is one of the worst positions anyone could have. There are tons of low risk, high reward stocks out there. No reason to accept high risk."
6/14/2021 13:17,stocks,"High risk no reward. 

It’s obvious when you’re dealing with bullshit blowhards. Well, it’s obvious when you’re not also a bullshitting blowhard. Being someone who actually does something in the real world has it’s rewards."
6/14/2021 15:54,stocks,Honestly with the amount of garbage companies the market is going nuts about I wouldn’t be surprised if this is another stock people bid up hoping for a short squeeze

6/14/2021 11:23,stocks,Oh no... I invested in Ride a while back... Didn't know it had this connotation. That's no good
6/14/2021 12:00,stocks,Dude I forgot that they did that PR with Pence. Then Biden does a photo-op with Ford. Why do politicians feel the need prop up failing companies?

But honestly recently I've began to think that a few years ago that has started changing. There are groups that are purposefully weaponizing the anonymity and freedom of speech to spread misinformation and that positive to negative ratio is getting closer and closer to 1.

The positives still outweigh the negatives but some things definitely need to change to curb the spread of misinformation and group think."

Your heart is surely in the right place but seriously, you're seeing ghosts. My bet is he's another teenager with dad's credit card hoping to get rich...

Europe is years ahead of USA when it comes to EV adaption and creating a charging network. Tesla was ""first to market"" with a good EV and thanks to massive government subsidiaries (see Norway) it was the most affordable. Yet these days it's not as smooth sailing. All charging stations/netowkr use the *open charging standard Tesla doesn't use* which means they got to build their own competing infrastructure in *every country*. Further more the price/quality comparison is not a favorable one for Tesla given the outright poor quality of modern model 3s. 




And last but not least the competition is *massive* you got stor ger cars, chepsrr cars and everything in between. Tesla used to dominate jut are now losing marketshare by the month as competitors steal their lunch. Though the biggest flaw is Tesla using proprietary charging tech, it means they withe rmust spend millions building their own network or realize customers won't use one car that won't work on ""every charger"""

I may trash Trumpers but I don't really ""fit in"" amongst the left either.

I would be a center-left moderate if America was rational politically.

I am focused on reality and have zero tribal instinct. That means BOTH political parties hate me as they prefer easily malleable tribal voters that will change their actual beliefs based on party affiliation.

I am a firm believer that parties should adopt the values of the base they represent, not tell that base how they should feel about a specific issue.

Then attack anyone that is not 100% on-board with whatever tribal political issue is popular.

Pro-gun, pro-free trade (globalist), pro-death penalty; social liberal with some conservative economic tilting.  


I vote mainly on economic issues and ignore social issues. I just don't make the millions needed to benefit from Republican economic policies."

6/14/2021 15:32,stocks,"I get you in a big way. I think people deserve to have autonomy over their own bodies and I truly think that something like medicare for all is the way forward for US healthcare. But my financial goals in the next five years include becoming a landlord, and I don't think that position in life should get me cancelled.

I think the federal government can be of great benefit to the American people but I do want individual state's to retain their sense of identity and I genuinely don't understand why there can't be a middle ground there.

I'm not saying we're the same in all or even most of our political leanings, but I do believe there are many, many disenfranchised people right now feeling the same way. Hopefully it brings about change at some point."
6/14/2021 16:07,stocks,"The reality is that the alt-right and the alt-left have more in common then they do different.

It's the MASSIVE amount of importance they place on those differences that is the issue.

The reality is that much of the difference is perception, not truth. Like the left wanting to take away all the guns and cheeseburgers is simply untrue but is a solid rallying cry and has been for years.

Most of the right are not racists like the left makes them out to be.

I was not political in the oast and if it were not for the trump movement, would still be apolitical."

Would I just set the strike price low as possible and expiration for half a year from now? (obviously paying a higher premium but in this scenario I'm sure the stock will go up)? Or would setting the strike price higher (like $35 strike price) be more beneficial in this magical scenario?

I just don't see how low strike prices can be bad. If the stock falls, the lower strike price has a higher chance of still being beneficial. If the stock rises, the low strike price becomes more powerful if exercised. Are the premiums differences so large? Why wouldn't you always just set a low strike price?

Like I know that's not how it works; I'm just giving this scenario to illustrate my lack of understanding. Thank you for any explanations."

6/14/2021 17:45,stocks,"The Nasdaq seems ready to exit a consolidation period that lasted 4 months to be honest. Unlike that stretch where it looked fantastic in late March and April, you have more of it participating in the last month (it may have had its first advance/decline line ATH since mid-February today).

I stubbornly still don't think it'll happen until July though. Do admit I could be wrong, today was just another day that reminded me more of early November to mid-February.

But regardless, if this is correct, the analogue that fits here is 2019, but a bit faster. If you weren't around for that one (I was around for the first pullback, lol), it had a fantastic recovery off entering bear market territory in 2018 and then pretty much only bounced around a range for 6 months. Followed that up by then grinding up 20%+ over 4 and a half months, and then we know what happened.

Yeah, I know, COVID won't be a thing, but you could still wind up flirting with a bear market anyway for a different reason. Not a crash, but something like 2018."

I began to confide more and more into the things I truly want to follow but it still hurts to see how there were opportunities to break even on various things I wanted to let go in order to consolidate with just a bit more patience. Then again anti-survivorship bias could also be at work since it doesn't let me appreciate all the areas where moving my money proved advantageous.

6/14/2021 15:03,stocks,"So you are buying a call option when the stock is at $20. And there is different strike prices.

If the stock price goes higher than the strike price you picked set (35 or 40), and you let it expire, you will purchase the stock at the strike price (35 or 40). You lose the premium either way.

Option is not always about ending with the stock (or selling the stock). Yes, the idea is that but the purpose of people buying and selling calls is not to end up with the stock, but to sell the contract before expiration at around 50% profit.

If we keep IV constant, if you buy a call option when the market price is at $20 at 35 strike price. And because is very out of the money. It might cost you $1 per contract. Now, lets say the market price increases to $25 in like a month. Your contract is now worth $20. Why? Because the closer the market price is to the strike price, the higher the premium.

Then you just sell the contract at $20 and you make $24. You dont need to wait for it to expire to make money with contracts. The same happens with puts.

Buying calls and puts, time is against you, so premium will decrease as it get closer to expiration, as long as we keep everything constant (which is beneficial when you are selling  calls or puts)."

6/14/2021 12:45,stocks,Patience dude. Football coming with fantasy only getting more popular and more and more states will legalize online gambling. I’m not worried about DKNG in the long term.
6/14/2021 12:32,stocks,"The company that is currently valued more than the entire American gambling market? Yeah, if you invested back when it was 1.2x or 1.5x the American gambling market you should've just actually gambled instead of fucking around with a trading app.

I think draftkings, as in the actual product, will give you returns. That's what I've done betting my Suns. Their matching alone (i.e., them giving me your money, thanks btw) is 6 or 7% returns depending on how much you deposit. Much less actually winning the money line

Depending on your analysts it will take five or six years before DKNG -- at current valuations -- will be worth ""only"" half of the American gaming market. That might be a good entry point"

6/14/2021 10:02,stocks,"It's been trading sideways for months, $32 resistance finally broke.

CRSR absolutely destroyed their last earnings, and I think people realized this company was heavily undervalued. There's another earnings report coming up in August (iirc) and I don't think people will be nearly as blind to it."
6/14/2021 10:10,stocks,New meme stock to add to basket. Look at CRSR volume lol
6/14/2021 10:17,stocks,"It's interesting. If WSB was able to pump CRSR to $42 through sheer will and no catalyst, that's a good sign. Now that CRSR is on the WSB radar, we might be in for a real treat the when next earnings report hits and there is a catalyst to ride onto as well. That's why I am not selling my CRSR even though I might hold heavier bags than I did before, as it's money I can just keep sitting on for the long term if needed. Rather wait it out and see if we can hit 50 either now or next earnings."
6/14/2021 10:00,stocks,"Going back up now. I bought at $31 last week and sold $39 today. 20% or so, can't complain for little risk."
6/14/2021 10:02,stocks,"I think it may have hit a ceiling for now. It ripped pretty hard for a long time so it may well be overvalued and due for a pullback. 

Heck look at the DOW. It's quite often been dipping the past 2 weeks. Value probably got overbought."
6/14/2021 10:02,stocks,"We have time traveled back to January 2021 of late in stocks to an extent. It didn't drop much then but what I noticed after the fact is that the Nasdaq being a monster hid a lot of sectors struggling after the first week or so of January until memapalooza occurred in late January.

It's likely a red light for the non-tech trade until the proxy that I use for it breaks down and sells off."
6/14/2021 10:21,stocks,Can you buy fractional shares? If so where?
6/14/2021 11:35,stocks,I think the the blue origin ride is going to create some more bullish attitudes towards aerospace stocks.
6/14/2021 11:46,stocks,"Ba might have a rocky next 1 to 2 earnings reports. But retail just got interested.  It's a longer term recovery. Might want to see if theres some farther out or go lighter on those. 

Lmt around 385 isnt bad, you could definitely make a heavier move on that.  Goodluck with it."

6/14/2021 18:34,stocks,"Meme stocks work in this cycle:

1. Pre hype
2. Hype
3. Post hype

If you entered in step 1 you can just hold or sell and wait for step 3.  These stocks get pumped then dumped. These are not long term investors driving up the price. Once those people decide to take gains the hype volume/price action will be gone. Either way you got in before the hype so good on you 👍"
6/14/2021 17:46,stocks,"It's all a personal choice, but I'm in the camp of like sell half or some and take profit and then see what happens in like a week or so. Nothing wrong with taking profit and you can in theory just use the money to buy again. If you are long on a stock, just don't even look at it and check it out maybe like once a quarter."
6/14/2021 18:52,stocks,"Since that is a follow strategy you can expect to do worse than they do, consistently. If you could buy what they buy and sell what they sell *before* they do, you would do well. But tell me how to accomplish that please."
6/14/2021 17:44,stocks,I don't think so. They are managing other people's money as well as like billions in assets. Their stragety will be different by nature.
6/14/2021 18:05,stocks,It’s probably a decent strategy as long as the stock price hasn’t changed much since when he bought it.
6/14/2021 18:41,stocks,"I think looking at big investors buys/sells are a useful TOOL but maybe you shouldn’t sole buy base off what they do. There are some things to consider.

One is timing. You may know warren buffet bought a stock within the last quarter, but you don’t know when exactly or what price, so that same stock still may not be as good of a buy 2 months later. 

Also consider scale and pace. Peter Lynch has written some good things on this subject. If you’re a retail investor and you’ve got $1000 to invest, you can buy anything and move quickly. 

If your Buffet, you’re more limited.  There’s not a lot of companies that just have, say, 1 billion dollars worth of stock available for him to purchase. Also it takes time to buy/sell that much stock so they have move at a glacial pace compared to retail investor so their strategies are gonna be a lot different than yours."
6/14/2021 18:47,stocks,"Hedge funds usually beat the market by 3-4% annually so that could prove to be a good strategy. They have a diverse portfolio though and some stocks go up, while others go down but they average up."

6/14/2021 12:22,stocks,"I've been watching it since you mentioned it the last week - I'm getting a bit itchy and wondering if I should start a position instead of waiting for ~310.  It's fallen through its technical support, with the 200 day MA sitting around 300 currently.  They could be on a collision course in that 310 range, in which case I'm adding heavily.  

I've had it happen a few times in the last couple months where I've set a price target only for the stock to bounce back at 5$/share more than that target.  I do think they're a really good long term hold, though."
6/14/2021 12:09,stocks,"I would say so, I bought at 37 before and the company is doing even better now. I would expect it to go to the 100s easily within 2 years, 3 years if it keeps trading like a value stock instead of a growth stock"

Cannot see them riding like $NVDA did.

Microchip shortage has impacted AMD and has made the third party market for GPU's pretty massive.  Unfortunate result of that, AMD is not making money on the third party resales.  It appears Apple is fully turning away from dGPU's with their own chips, which also will impact AMD longterm.  If AMD eGPU can work with M1/M1X/MX chips, there is some promise for tapping into that customer base."

6/14/2021 14:05,stocks,"It comes down to how you want to invest. Generally this is why people talk about buy low cost index funds/etf's. Set and forget it. Since the market on average returns like 10% a year, you will have good years and bad years. It's also hard to beat."
6/14/2021 14:03,stocks,"There's been a lot of DD posts in WSB about it, so a lot of people are treating it as a meme stock. The 25% gain today is nice, but the difference between this and the other 'meme stocks' is that CRSR is probably valued fairly at this price, if not still slightly undervalued"
6/14/2021 14:03,stocks,"They are a solid company, but getting caught up with reddit momentum. They probably fall into ""meme"" since it's being pumped by reddit."

6/14/2021 15:09,stocks,"I would also like to know. But in the absence of news, I’d just say stabilizing after the spike last week, and possibly the rotation into tech."
6/14/2021 14:24,stocks,"I think F is a better play.  The Maverick seems really interesting and with high cost of used cars, it's great Ford is making a ""cheaper"" newer hybrid. 

Weed is still mainly just a retail play. Their last quarter wasn't so great during a pandemic. Also, I would be careful with Canadian companies, since weed is not legal in the states yet. When it does get legalized, there is no idea how trade will work between countries and there's no idea how well they can even break into the US market, since there is already going to be a ton of domestic competition.

I think if you want to do weed stocks, ETF's are a better bet. That, or go after the pick axe play on them, the hydroponic market."

It's finally taking off but honestly with good sales numbers in the next month or so (this is the gamble, nobody knows what those will be but there's reason to think they'll be good) it should hit 20+."
6/14/2021 11:48,stocks,"I hope so. I'm in big. I'm not too worried. I can stomach a drop to $20. After the huge climb last week, I'm not surprised by a day of profit taking. If it keeps falling all week, I'll be a little unhappy."

Outside of the oil sector it just hasn't been the same since the Dow threw jumping over 300 points in the trash on May 10th. It really looks like a medium term top was booked at this moment intraday.

And I wouldn't have said that until last week. I'm saying it now. A bunch of cyclicals made medium term tops on May 10th."

And yeah, the us gambling market is small, but it's increasingly being legalized in more and more states. The reason its as small as it is is because sports gambling had been mostly illegal. It's gonna grow, and quickly.

You can track a few different hedgefunds and see it in action. Personally I follow Citadel because I assume they have access to that sweet sweet Robinhood data.

In May they filed their updated 13F-HR/A. Guess who suddenly doubled their CLNE? Well, for me, it was then that I knew it was time to buy CLNE

Take a look at WSB daily and say that again.

Great company, absolutely, but this run is all meme."

6/14/2021 9:10,stocks,Nah if you see what they do to other stocks the floor gets a pretty big rise. The floor on this before was 29 to 30.  I wouldnt be shocked to see this under 35 again but it's not going back to 30 imo. Just my 2 shares worth.

6/14/2021 19:41,stocks,This is the correct answer
6/14/2021 11:22,stocks,So wait for the inevitable dip? I'm still new to options trading so I'm still feeling my way around with a lot of these things. This wouldn't be my only option in my portfolio but FOMO is a nightmare 😭
6/14/2021 10:14,stocks,The spike is on good new and it beat earnings as it always have. I love what they're doing with the business  and it seems like the stock has been killing it ever since I bought into it a while ago. I just wanted to know when it's time to let go of a stock. Is when the stock isn't performing that well or when there is better profit to be made? I'm just wondering.
6/14/2021 10:33,stocks,"Understood, I was looking at ratios and CP just blows all RR out of the water IMO.  BUT, where did you hear about CSX buying KSU?  I thought that CNI was buying KSU?...

But super excited for that CSX stock split happening and a CSX rail is right next to my place so I see the trains almost everyday go by (sentimental value).

Think I am going to consolidate into CSX as I am holding long term regardless for the train stocks"
6/14/2021 10:52,stocks,"CNI is buying KSU, not CSX. CSX is a southeast US line."

6/14/2021 11:08,stocks,"Love UNP, but CSX has the sentimental value due to having a line in my backyard basically.  UNP is legit though, but it already has the largest market cap for RRs - and it's ratios are lower than that of CSX or CP."

6/14/2021 14:11,stocks,"No freaking joke. Makes me more glad than ever that I agree with my advisors to make my Roth VTI/VXUS and DCA into it monthly.

Have learned a lot from tackling DIY investing on the side for myself but boy has it been an emotional rollercoaster up until now where I finally started coming to terms with this stuff. 

It hurts letting a lot of that stuff go and watching it rise back but this year's made me realize I'll probably be better off long term not trying to juggle as much crap since it just makes me that much more likely to make a dumb blunder."
6/14/2021 14:10,stocks,Even after this pump I'd still consider it a bit underpriced. They've been low key kicking ass. It was my current value play. I find it unlikely many people were shorting this stock.. But I guess I'll have to find another stock to start pumping money into.
6/14/2021 14:20,stocks,It took me a while to find a solid company that was undervalued in this market. Now I have to do it again sooner than I hoped.
6/14/2021 14:33,stocks,"I'm a truck guy and leaving the industry that requires me to have a hauling heavy one soon, so the Maverick has honestly looked really appealing. Feels like I'm a bit late on a lot of run up, but there's plenty of time for actual production to prove a new market foothold for them.

I guess I knew the answer but have been tempted by the weed stocks lately. Thanks for the insight."
6/14/2021 15:23,stocks,"Ford has had a hot hand and recent rise.  There's a school of thought that it's not properly valued and just applying an average multiple to earnings it should be closer to 18.  Sometimes such moves even overshoot, so I was waiting for it to get in the 17-19 range.  However in the recent week or so it faltered at $16 and is now under $15.   

If someone is a nimble enough trader there could be a move to catch here.  It feels like bad news like the production number cut has already been digested.  If there's to be any bad news in the form of quarterly sales announcements, those are a way off.  Presumably 2021 will see headlines anticipating the various new models, order backlogs, etc.

I can't make good predictions in the weed space.  I do know that when Canada legalized, the expectations were high and it turned out to be an utter bust up there.  

Unlike OP, I wouldn't want to commit to either industry for 5-7.  Need to pay closer attention to holdings and the economy than that."
6/14/2021 19:42,stocks,Lmao
6/14/2021 17:37,stocks,The banks are the primary forces trying to manipulate the bond market and market in general thinking they can force the feds hand into making a rate hike which they have failed to do every time in history because they are fucking idiots.

6/14/2021 12:03,stocks,Jefferies maintained at buy with a $630 target (up from $560 where it currently sits).  That is why it is moving.
6/14/2021 11:49,stocks,"It just pumped straight up over last week. Look at one year graph.
No news but usually there is a correction after such a spike. Better to sell now and take profits."

6/14/2021 14:38,stocks,That's a pretty big if. Trying to time the market is not possible and the catalyst for this today is mometum/volume. Everything will come down to reality at some point.

6/14/2021 11:03,stocks,"Except that CRSR was specifically targeted by WSB last Friday. That's what prompted this, it's why I bought Friday AH and made a small profit this morning, as I specifically saw that WSB was making a play on CRSR.

6/14/2021 12:18,stocks,That's one strategy. Sometimes you actually want to lose your shares. I generally just sell CCs at strikes where I'd be perfectly ok with selling.

6/14/2021 16:53,stocks,"No worries. I mean generally stocks tend to tradeside ways until there is a catalyst. That could be like earnings, news, etc. It's been up the past month, 35%, so having a down day of like 2% is competely normal. 

OTLY is interesting because of they are valued at 13 Billion dollars. The next big catalyst for them will be their earnings report or any PR that might come out with new contracts. I've been eying the company, but waiting it out to see what happens."

For me I could keep it for the long term, as in 20-30 years, if I believed it was a stock that would keep going up.

6/14/2021 14:30,stocks,"For sure. Just my two cents, they are still undervalued, but profit taking will happen and momentum will die off.

6/14/2021 11:08,stocks,"oh honey that's adorable you think that. Up until last night, CRSR was some of the most downvoted/controversial posts in WSB and didn't even crack top ten in most talked about. They had nothing to do with this, just like they never do

For the record I sold at a 40% profit this morning, and made 10k. So I honestly am not salty about the situation at all

I guarantee you that when their 13F-HR/As come out, all the typical hedgefunds are going to have a big ole slice of this pie because it's them that's pumping it. Look at CRSR's charts. They've been swinging it up and down for the last three months. It was bound to finally pop

This last week maybe they threw in a few extra bots, but it's been like this the whole time. A few CRSR posts every week or two, move the ticker up 20% in a week, and then if it doesn't catch bring it back down. Eventually the bossbabes at wsb reached a critical mass of FOMO."

Was trying to make all these hotshot maneuvers but then things got yucky. Now I have decided to take a bit of a break and give the holds I have looked into more a chance to show their mettle while I invest in myself and get a bit more cash all while taking more time to actually watch the market for good opportunities and not FOMO.

6/14/2021 14:46,stocks,"Yea. As to your last sentence, I've only been an active (beyond retirement) investor for 4 months, so I do understand the time in vs timing concept, but in practice I'm still learning how to view things in a long time window. All I really know is I've been securing a strong VOO/blue chip basis, and I want to make some individual plays in companies relevant in my life while I continue learning more and more.

I do have one weed play in HITI, but it's only $100. Just something I wanted to look at when I log into my portfolio lol. I like your idea about an ETF a bit more if I decide to get a larger position in the future."
6/14/2021 12:13,stocks,"I do agree that the multiple dips, low performance and the reverse stock split do give me pause, which is why I am not taking out a large position.

6/14/2021 13:47,stocks,"Good point, I guess I was definitely oversimplifying things. Appreciate the back and forth man. Yeah I want it for the long haul and I’ve been waiting for a dip for a while so guess I was just impatient and tempted to buy at the first sign of red. I’ll hold off and wait for an actual dip."
6/14/2021 14:59,stocks,"Kind of. I mean you are taking profits now. There is totally a chance the stock could continue to go up and up, but right now there is no catalyst for this jump other than the momentum from reddit."
6/14/2021 11:16,stocks,"lol either way, I'm happy it was mentioned on WSB regardless of how it went up. :)"
6/14/2021 12:29,stocks,"You would generally pick a strike price where you would be comfortable selling. If you bought at $10 and are comfortable selling at $12, that would be good strike price to choose, assuming the premium was attractive.

Generally, you need to consider the tradeoffs between strike and premium. If you want downside protection, you would choose a lower strike. If you are bullish and just want some extra money, you would choose a higher strike.

There's a lot more to consider, but that's the basic idea."

I mean if you got in during IPO prices, it's never too late to take some profit. This one is a really hard one, since it could really go either way. Also if you are long on a stock, sometimes it's good just to not even take a look. Just keep buying and don't worry about."

While there’s no steadfast definition of what constitutes a meme stock, one common thread across the many names being pitched on social media is a focus on heavily shorted companies. Shares of Reddit icon GameStop Corp. jumped as much as 2,500% in January after day traders noticed its short interest had ballooned to record levels.

Investors looking for other stocks that might fit that mold will find nearly 230 firms with a market capitalization of at least $100 million and short interest of 15% or more, according to S3 Partners data compiled by Bloomberg. More than 80% of those names have managed positive returns over the last month with the average gain sitting at about 18%, while the S&P 500 Index rose 2.3%.

6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"Questions from a younger investor I am a 28 yo, single w/no kids. I currently have approx. 6 months emergency fund in the bank. I have approx. $3k in crypto and $4k in my brokerage account. Before, during and now post-covid I have made literally almost no total gains. If I make $30 from a stock there is one I lost $30 from. I am a type of person who needs to sell a stock once it makes me $30-$40 and I am working very hard on making this trend stop because I know it is stupid.

I currently have 14 stocks in my brokerage account. After doing some research it seems like it may be best to just buy 5 or 6 stocks and just hold for the long term. My questions are this: Does this sound like a good idea? I do not want to invest in all of FAANG because I believe Netflix will trade sideways/down in the next few years. I also believe Facebook is going to underperform the next 2 years. I only would want Apple, Alphabet and Google. The other stocks I like are Tesla (currently own) and Square (currently own). If I had to pick one more stock it would be Berkshire Hathaway Class B. So my portfolio would go from owning 14 stocks to 6:

Apple, Alphabet, Google, Tesla, Square and Berkshire Hathaway Class B.

I feel like 6 is a good number, and maybe to sell my Square and buy a bunch of ASO stock instead, or tolerate owning a 7th stock? Thoughts? Apologies but I am somewhat new to investing (started right before COVID)."
6/14/2021 5:34,stocks,"Your making 30, then losing 30? Your trading those big names, and selling for a loss?

Get an Education first, trade on a simulator if your goal is to day trade. You can dm me, I'll point you in a direction I found helpful for this.

If your on this inbetween investment and day trading, I suggest you ""trade around a core,"" strategy."
6/14/2021 4:22,stocks,I feel like you need to diversify and also you should be gauging gains by % not by $
6/14/2021 4:41,stocks,"Stock picking is tough and takes an absolute load of time and expertise to do correctly.  There are bull and bear cases for every company and you could just as easily pick 6 underperforming stocks as 6 overperforming stocks.

I think you need to start from the beginning and define your goals and time frame.  Are you trying to make a quick increase or are you actually investing with retirement in mind?  If you're investing for retirement then your actions (selling after a small increase) is at odds with your goal.  You then need to develop a personal strategy based around your goals and then stick to that strategy.

If you're investing long term, then then answer is almost certainly to put most of your money in broad market ETFs and add monthly, and let it compound until you retire.  Even with this strategy there is considerable medium term risk, so make sure you understand that a $4,000 investment today could be worth $3,500 or less in 5 years time.  

For the stocks you've mentioned, the real question is why exactly do you think they'll outperform?  If you can't give a really detailed answer that addresses both the upside and the downside of the futures of those companies then you should consider staying away from stock picking.  Only invest in the number of companies that you can keep up with to this level of detail - you should probably be putting in at least an hour a week keeping up with each company to refine your opinion of them.

Or, if you don't want to do any of that, just acknowledge that what you're doing is more akin to gambling than investing.  There's nothing wrong with that - but you need to be honest with yourself about it."
6/14/2021 6:52,stocks,Just go long term with a single highly diversified ETF. But first repay debt and try avoiding whenever possible except for housing.
6/14/2021 14:17,stocks,"This is the opposite of diversification into highly concentrated tech. So no, it’s not a good idea. If you can’t stop yourself from selling all the time, just buy ETFs. 70% VTI 30% VXUS and rebalance every six months maybe. 

Also Google and alphabet are the same thing"
6/14/2021 4:48,stocks,Absolute first step is to stop selling. Especially crypto. If youre selling every 30-40 dollar gain you are trading not investing and have very low odds of making good money with no experience.

6/14/2021 6:09,stocks,"Based on the stocks you own, I would say that your investments are hugely tilted towards growth stocks. As the broader economy expands, you are likely to miss out on sectors such as financials, travel & leisure, mining, consumer discretionary etc. which have hardly seen any big gains.

your 6 picks don't seem bad per se, I hold most of them. but I would add an equal amount to VTI or VT so you don't have all your eggs in the same 6 baskets.

6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"How is this even possible not to be going up daily Day after day, report after report. Semiconductor shortages worldwide are halting production of anything that uses a computer chip technology to function. The largest manufactures in the world
across almost every sector in the world are shutting down and slowing production because they can’t get chips. So my question is, we have always been told about supply and demand. Why are semiconductor companies not going through the roof faster than meme stocks. Fundamentals would dictate if you have more business than you can handle and can sell every chip you make for the next 3-5 years just to catch up, your sales and
Profits would exceed predictions. This would cause the stock prices to rise. This isn’t happening and it’s confusing why not. The largest chip manufactures are all building multi billion dollar expansions to keep up with the shortage and demand. So why are chip stocks trading sideways and down in some instances with them making the most desired products worldwide."
6/14/2021 2:44,stocks,"This is actually a valid question and the semiconductor industry is one of the more interesting ones to me.

First off I'll use a couple popular examples here from the past year.

Micron went from a 52 week low of $42 to a 52 week high of $95. 

Nvidia $349 to $717

AMD $48 to $99

They went up huge already!

So here is a good lesson about the market, it's forward looking. It's about investing in what is going to happen, not what has happened and this is especially true in Semiconductors. Those unfamiliar with the space are likely to jump in at all the wrong times.

The shortage is nothing new and investors have been piling into this trade for months! 

So what's happening now?

Well now you have more and more semiconductor factories being able to operate at higher and higher capacity as the pandemic winds down across the globe. 

You have the U.S. passing funding of $53 billion dollars to onshore production of Semiconductors. 

You have one of the largest markets, crypto, decreasing in value, and the second largest crypto asset, Ethereum, on the verge of moving away from mining all together. 

Also companies haven't been able to capitalize on the market in the way you'd want. Although a shortage can raise prices higher, it's different then a demand spike.

They weren't able to produce as much, which means they weren't able to move a higher amount of volume at a higher price. 

Thus being able to produce more then fixes the supply issue, lowers the price, and then they are able to move more product, but at a lower price. 

So the ideal time to get into the Semiconductor trade was right when the shortage started to happen. When it looked like nobody was going to be buying a car or a PC and all the production was slowing down, basically when it looked like a terrible time to buy.

Now you have a decreasing of demand, or atleast a leveling out, matched with an increasing ability for companies to meet that demand.

Thus although they will finally be moving more volume, it'll be at a lower price. 

Semiconductors is an industry that traps a lot of people. The worst time to invest usually ends up being the best, and the what looks like the best ends up being the worst. 

So if you're wondering why they aren't going up now?

*TLDR:*

Investors already bid up the price of the companies in anticipation for a shortage and are now leaving the trade in anticipation of an increase of supply in the market."

Now, they will sell them over 4-5 years, maybe even at a slightly higher price. But, the NPV of those cash flows may be equal or even in favour of getting the chips out the door at a faster pace/lower price."
6/14/2021 5:44,stocks,Very simple. Production capacity. Many were already close to maximum production. So there has been an increase in pricing for a lot of the semi-c stocks but unless they can produce more it’s not going to fly like you suggest it should.

6/14/2021 4:08,stocks,Doesn't really answer OP's question does it though? Increased demand is the same thing as reduced supply with regards to the supply-demand curve.
6/14/2021 12:48,stocks,"Semiconductors are just components and in components back orders aren't necessarily a good thing. They are to an extent, but not this much. 

With component industries, one companies backorder is another companies opportunity. It's a chance for them to supply relatively the same product faster, and possibly cheaper.

So this forces companies to increase the cost of production in order to clear out back orders and keep customers from leaving. 

Sure it's an industry wide issue, but it's an opportunity to gain future market share, so it becomes a race to provide for customers and gain market share. 

This causes the cost of revenue to go way up and the entire industry to end up over supplying which ends up leading the eventual down cycle.

Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, because they are a commodity. 

I know they get lumped in with tech, but an investor can't think of them as tech, they trade much more like a commodity.

I also know that because of the boom in PC gaming and the build your own PC market pockets of the industry have become more consumer facing than ever before, which as led novice investors to believe they are more than commodities. But this portion of the industry is relatively small and most Semiconductors and the products that use them it makes no difference to the consumer what brand is used. 

Also worth noting AMDs popularity really took off from essentially being able to supply the same product as Intel, just cheaper, and that just emphasizes the commodity aspect of this industry, even the consumer facing side.

Now long term, the industry continues to consolidate during down trends and the long term demand continues to rise. So there has been a trend of every cycle being higher highs and lower lows, I expect that to continue, but nonetheless it's still very cyclical, and I don't see that changing yet."
6/14/2021 4:55,stocks,"Not exactly.

A reduced supply also means an inability for you to meet demand, which means that you aren't able to move as much product as you could.

I know there's a theory side to supply and demand, but it rarely plays out. 

In reality there are long term agreements, contracts, customer loyalty, and brand reputation to name a few reasons why the price doesn't necessarily reflect the supply/demand relationship.

Where as a high demand environment would mean more customers, newer agreements, more contracts locking in future sales, and so on, that would allow them to sell even more product. Even at a lower price it'd be an environment they could capitalize on capturing a higher percentage of the demand.

But what's important to keep in mind is that the price never will raise to exact level to equate an inability to supply during a supply shortage, for reasons stated above. It'll go up, certainly, but not proportionately or else there wouldn't be a shortage and there would be plenty of semiconductors on the market, there would just be customers priced out of them. 

Instead it ends up being a capital intensive process of restarting factories, hiring staff, and building new facilities in order to increase supply. 

So not only are you making less in proportion to demand, but you're going to have to spend more in order to keep customers and insure future sales, or risk losing out to other competitors who move ahead of you. 

And you're doing all this during a period in which demand isn't necessarily any higher. Which means there will still be a down turn in demand and you'll be left over producing and over supplying the market. 

So you're spending all that money just to sell a normal amount of product at what will end up being lower prices. 

But the trade off is someone else in the industry does that too you, gains market share, and then when demand does pick up you're left not being able to capitalize.

In theory supply and demand is neat and orderly, but it never plays out that way in reality."
6/14/2021 5:05,stocks,"Hmm knowing how dependant modern industry is on semiconductors, saying ""there would just be customers priced out of them"" is like saying people would stop drinking water if prices doubled. You don't really have an option do you"
6/14/2021 5:28,stocks,"They may be important, but nonetheless they are basically a commodity. 

Much of a companies success in Semiconductors has to do with business management, forming relationships, and being a reliable trading partner.

Plenty of commodities are important, but it doesn't create a scenario where anyone one producer is necessarily more valuable because of it, nor does it make the producers more valuable by themselves.

It actually attracts competition to an industry where there isn't a lot of room for a competitive advantage. 

But if a product is selling out that means the price isn't high enough, and semiconductors are selling out instantly. And that price will never rise to the level that would stop that scenario from happening during a supply crunch like this, for reasons I explain earlier.

But yes, smaller customers would be priced out by larger companies. Everyone has a budget and no matter how much they need something, that doesn't mean they can afford it."
6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"Does a stock being overvalued matter if buying long-term? I am wanting to build up a long-term portfolio and am doing as much reading as I can in fundamental analysis, diversification etc but one thing sticks out to me. If a company is significantly overvalued now but you believe the company will continue to thrive long term, does that reduce it's priority in your porfolio at all or is the current price totally irrelevant with DCA?

&#x200B;

I imagine the answers will be close to my thoughts which are ""a little bit"". Idea 1 is to sit on more cash and wait for doomsday and finally buy in at a reasonable price, but in the meanwhile you have underutilized cash. or you DCA day 1 and whatever happens happens.

&#x200B;

An example of what I'm looking at is Nvidia. Fairly confident in the long term prospects but by all accounts it is MASSIVELY overpriced by the research I could do (or find, realistically)."
6/14/2021 3:17,stocks,"Yes, but not as much as you may think.

Two examples come to mind.

One is where you could've invested in Microsoft at the peak of the Dotcom bubble in 2000 and still returned 9% a year and beat the index.

Walmart was way overvalued in the 70's but returned something like 13% a year since then.

Two things they had in common? They both have long periods of vastly underperforming the index. They both turned out to be incredibly good businesses and that never changed.

It's hard to find a business that good, and it's hard to keep faith in a business being that good after 5 or worse 10 years of under performance.

That's why people like valuations, you don't need to pick the next great company over the next 30 years and remain confident in it when everything else looks better. 

Buying a great company and staying invested is a lot harder than it sounds.

It also had lead a lot of people holding on to GE way to long and riding GM into bankruptcy.

Seems obvious in hindsight, but telling the difference between Microsoft being a market beating investment and GE being a money losing investment would have been an impossible decision in the late 90's."

6/14/2021 3:05,stocks,"The first difference is your return. If you pay $1.50 for $1 of actual value, it doesn't matter what your time horizon is. Your returns will be lower.

The second problem is margin of safety. If you buy a company that is overvalued, there is no margin for things to go any other way than excellent. Is it possible for this to happen over, say, a 10-year time horizon? Yes. Is it likely? No."
6/14/2021 3:10,stocks,"The entire question is based in the assumption that ""being overvalued"" is some sort of objective truth. That ain't so, so the thought experiment makes no sense.

6/14/2021 2:07,stocks,"It all boils down to your conviction in the company and whether it’s “walked the talk” previously. When you’re buying an overvalued company at the moment, you’re doing it with the premise that the company has a lot to offer down the line and is posed for good stable revenue growth in the future and will also continue to expand across businesses. Ask yourself if that’s what the company is posed towards. Valuations now will be an entirely different numeric 10-15 years down the line. Buy into the business and its prospects, let the price just be background noise."
6/14/2021 5:03,stocks,"If you buy a wonderful company at its top price of the year, and then hold it for three decades as it continues to grow and flourish, it really won’t matter if you over paid a bit.

But thats usually not the way the world works, the reason value investors like to wait for a company to go on sale is less about increasing profits and much more about preventing losses.

If I’m wrong about a company and its future prospects**but** I bought it for half its fair value I’m probably still fine.

Ask yourself this question: If I deployed 1/3rd of my investable money into Nvidia on Monday, and on Tuesday its price fell by half, would I sell for half price? or would I buy twice as much.

This isn’t about blind trust in the market or diamond hands or any of that, its about how well you understand what you’re investing in, and how strong your conviction in that understanding is."

Is the company going to do anything that will cause massive increases in revenue? Is the company going to corner a market or suddenly find a new revenue stream which will make money rain down from the sky?

Those are the things I focus on."

If the recovery back is quick then likely not much opportunity cost lost. If the recovery is very slow then there will be much opportunity cost involved. The fall and recovery will likely be based on how much is the share overvalued by, conditions surrounding the fall, and what the business does in recovery.

1 - 1000% return

6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"When calling banks or stock brokerage 
I thought I'd share my simple life hack if you're ever faced with a long quote time on waiting to speak with someone.

1. Write down the number selections when navigating through menu over the phone
2. Hang up once it puts you in line to speak with someone
3. Redial and select French (Canada) or Spanish (USA)
4. Press the number selections as if you're calling the English side
5. Start speaking English as all agents have to be bilingual

By doing this I found that wait time lasted anywhere from 5 minutes to 10 minutes in comparison to 3 hours on the English side

With more new investors entering the market, I believe the queue will become even longer as more people invest and using this will save some time."

6/14/2021 9:48,stocks,"Another tip is to save the number WITH the selections. Use comma (,) for a one second pause.

I just feel sorry for the poor Spanish/French-only speaking ppl who won't even be able to get through, now. 🤣☹"
6/14/2021 5:25,stocks,I used to work at the bank and ppl like u always made me laugh because we actually HAVE to speak the language that came with the call. You most likely have landed on an agent who is bilingual and it probably wasn't a busy day in his/she queue. If a call came in French u best believe I will be speaking French to you only. There is a language queue for a reason. Also a lot of these agents are not bilingual. They are doing the language queue only.
6/14/2021 7:53,stocks,"Better life hack - call them, pick French or Spanish, and then speak French or Spanish to whomever picks up. Added benefit of not having to record the number selections, duh.

Comparing the two Reddits (particularly the stock reddit), you get people very certain of their ideas, and then often it not happening. Similar to the stock analysts as well.

6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"""Time In The Market"" vs. ""Its OK to take profits"" Obviously these popular contradictory statements are thrown around quite a lot. I've been investing in some blue chip stocks like AAPL that seem to go nowhere. I bought Apple at 125.00 last August and in hindsight it seems like it would have been to good to sell it on Jan 25 @ 145.00, but I've been subscribing to the mindsight of ""time in the market"" trumps ""timing the market"".

SO how do you guys know when to sell and whether it makes sense to just hold and look at it in 5 years?

PS. I've also heard people talk about selling before earnings and buying the dip. Haven't tried this but is this a good practice?"
6/13/2021 23:59,stocks,"Time in the the market...means exactly that. Not 'time in a stock beats timing a stock'

This applies more toward index funds. With regards to stocks it's obviously more complex. It depends on your strategy, risk tolerance, goals and expectations for the underlying company."
6/14/2021 0:02,stocks,"Time in the market and time in a stock are not the same. What’s your price target for AAPL? That’s the price at which you say “this stock seems a bit overpriced and is therefore a good opportunity to sell and find another underpriced stock.” It’s an investment because you like the company and are comfortable owning it because it will pay dividends and you’re reasonably confident the stock price will rise to your target. Whether it takes 10 years or 10 weeks, once it hits that target, you can sell. 

This just happened to me with ANAT. It shot up 25% in like a single day a month ago, to what was my price target. I would have been happy to own ANAT for years but by a fluke of the market I didn’t have to. I sold and bought new positions. My time in the market is the same, my allocations are different."

a) dont want to own a stock for whatever reason (change of strategie, something fundamentally changed, outlook into the future changed etc.)

b) if I believe a stock is overvalued for the current price"
6/14/2021 1:20,stocks,"At least to me, time in market means long enough time, everything goes up. Inflation and more efficient society allows stocks to rise. 

Taking profits is more about people who fear losing out.

For example I got tesla stock, waited 2 years and sold when it doubled. Within the next few months, it soared. 

I'm not upset I sold, I could have made 400 percent instead I made 100 percent. That tesla money went into other companies I felt weren't as over valued."
6/14/2021 5:43,stocks,"We do not know. We make educated guesses and sometimes are spot on and sometimes miss out on great profits. This is the basis of investing: There are no rules no guidelines, long term investment is simply about spotting good businesses before the crowd notices them."
6/14/2021 5:47,stocks,"Ive bought some around 20% of all time low and I’m keeping them until they pay dividends, because I think that’s when they stop growing. For some I just sell 25% of stock after 300% profit then more as it goes up."

Apple has only only place to go unless it reinvents itself more then watchs, mac's, iPhones and $300 headphones. I usually buy companies that have room to grow to. IMO I think apple is done with increasing profits by crazy amounts."
6/14/2021 11:00,stocks,"I subscribe to the mindset of never selling stocks unless rebalancing. Apple is a huge performer in my portfolio, but at 40% holdings after the last couple years I can't stay completely in Apple.

6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"HMPT LDI 2 unloved stocks with PE ratios under 4. Great earnings reports, record sales. Down a lot after RKT report, 2nd Look? Happy Sunday everyone. Hope everyone had an amazing weekend. A few weeks ago I highlighted the sector which also included RKT and UWMC. These 2 mortgage plays have recovered 25+% since then. It is my belief that these 2, RKT, UWMC was helped by the MEME craze. Both tickers were very popular early on. Unfortunately, the beginning of last month RKT missed earnings by a penny and all 4 of these in unison made 52 week or all time lows at the same time. A company like HMPT which was under 1% short is now near 10%. LDI is now near 25%!!! It is very wild because all 4 make tons of money and have had great earnings reports.

Let us first take a look at HMPT. The current market cap stands at near 900 million. The stock price trades at 6.53. The last report they beat by 31 cents and came out 1.06 per share beating the 75 cent consensus. 2 quarters ago they came in at 1.22 beating the 1.20. Before that it just IPOed. There sales have gone from 130 million in 2018 to 1.3 billion by end of 2020. They went from a loss to making money. They are expected to earn between 2.50-2.65 on the year! 

LDI actually had a special dividend of 200 million which is 62 cents a share. They also will give a regular dividend spending roughly 100 million...giving to shareholders. It is valued at 4.3 billion and trades at 13.99. There first report as a publicly traded company was outstanding with a 42 cent beat coming in at 98 cents. They are expected to make close to 4 a share!!! There revenue has gone from 980 million in 2018 to 4.1 billion!!! 

I understand these are new to the market. Have some debt as they are new issuance and growing fast. However the recent cash flows will far outpace all debt requirements. I would expect LDI and HMPT to recover like UWMC and RKT. 25%+ since they crashed. RKT was 16.20 and UWMC was 6.25 all made all time lows within 48 hours!

Thoughts? Thank you."
6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week: Oracle, Adobe, Kroger While bulls continue to lead the markets forward, investor focus will likely shift to macro indicators, such as interest rates and inflation, as the Federal Reserve begins its two-day meeting this week.

Although the central bank is unlikely to make any moves on rates, it could provide some insights into how it sees the economic rebound progressing and whether the need to remove some monetary stimulus has indeed arrived.  

So far, stocks investors don’t see any danger to their favorable views on the market. The S&P 500 finished on Friday at a new high, posting a 0.4% gain for the week. Keeping this macro picture in mind, following are three stocks we'll be monitoring in the coming week.

1. Oracle
Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) will release its fiscal 2021, fourth-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, June 15, after the market close. Analysts are projecting $1.31 a share profit on sales of $11.02 billion.

The shares of the software company are surging this year on improving demand for the tech giant’s cloud computing services after years of stagnant sales. Its stock closed on Friday at $82.90 after climbing 28% this year, more than three times the return produced by the benchmark NASDAQ 100 Index.


Growth prospects are improving as the company focuses on cloud computing services in an effort to accelerate revenue growth at the world’s second-largest software maker. Customer interest in the firm’s internet-based applications has finally offset declining demand for its legacy tools.


2. Adobe Systems
Another stock that will come under investor scrutiny this coming week is Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE). The software manufacturer, whose product lineup includes Photoshop, will release its fiscal 2021, second quarter earnings on Thursday, June 17 after the close. Wall Street expects $2.81 EPS and $3.73 billion of revenue.


Adobe’s earnings during the pandemic showed that the software maker’s cloud-based creative tools are in great demand. Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen has offered new creative software tools to clients to accelerate Adobe’s revenue growth. 

In March, the company raised its 2021 fiscal year revenue forecast to $15.45 billion from $15.15 billion and said sales in its main digital media segment would increase 22% after earlier projecting 19% growth. Adjusted earnings will be about $11.85 a share, an increase from $11.20 previously forecast.

The company introduced a version of its popular app—Illustrator—for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad, back in October, as part of an effort to expand its products' footprint to include more devices used by professionals and hobbyists.

Consumers of Document Cloud products—including Adobe Acrobat PDF and electronic signature software—have surged with millions working from home.  Adobe shares closed on Friday at $541.26 after rising 8% this year.

3. Kroger
Supermarket behemoth, Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) will report its Q1, 2021 earnings on Thursday before the market opens. Analysts are expecting $0.98 a share profit on sales of $39.56 billion.

Kroger's stock has gained 22% this year on the grocer’s surging sales and its participation in the U.S. vaccination campaign against COVID-19. The company is delivering millions of vaccinations to people nationwide, creating more repeat customers for its pharmacies and supermarket offerings. Kroger generated record sales of $132.5 billion in the year ended Jan. 30.

Kroger is betting that its in-store pharmacies and clinics can keep its supermarkets central to consumers’ lives even as the coronavirus recedes. Next week’s earnings could provide some insight to investors regarding the path it intends to take once the pandemic is contained.

“COVID has taught us that pharmacy is always really important and will be important as we go forward,” Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s chief executive, told WSJ.com in March."

6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"Amazon details new warehouse robots, ‘Ernie’ and ‘Bert’. Amazon warehouse workers could soon be joined by a couple new co-workers: Ernie and Bert.

Those are the names of the new robots Amazon is testing with the goal of reducing strenuous movements for workers.

While the introduction of robots to the workplace often raises questions about whether human jobs will be replaced, Amazon argues they simply allow workers to focus on tasks that most need their attention while minimizing their potential for injury. Amazon said it’s added over a million jobs around the world since it began using robotics in its facilities in 2012.

In May, Amazon announced a goal of reducing recordable incident rates by 50% by 2025. It plans to invest over $300 million into safety projects this year.

Amazon described in a blog post Sunday four robots it’s testing to move items across its fulfillment centers and closer to workers.

Ernie helps remove items from a robotic shelf so employees don’t have to. The process doesn’t save time, Amazon said in the post, but testing has so far indicated it could make work safer for employees.

Bert is one of Amazon’s first Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), made to navigate facilities independently, even while workers are moving around. Unlike other robots, Bert would not need to remain in a restricted space, meaning workers could ask it to take items across a facility. Amazon said Bert could eventually move heavier items.

The argument against rich people “not paying their fair share” is that they apparently have a net worth in the billions but don’t seem to contribute that much in taxes. The problem is that people don’t get that CEO compensation/net worth is primarily in stocks. Asking someone to be taxed on their net worth is like asking you to be taxed based on the value of you plus your home vs. based on salary. 

Companies like Amazon pay taxes— but then they get rebates for R&D expenses because the government wants to stimulate innovation (and why shouldn’t they? Amazon is innovative). They also carry forward losses to lower the tax burden, which is something every business owner in America can do. This is how they effectively “don’t pay taxes”.

6/14/2021 14:51,stocks,"You need to look up Norbert’s gambit for your currency conversion.

It works like this:
You buy DLR (on the TSX) in CAD.
Transfer the shares from your CAD account to your USD account.
You sell as DLR.U (on the TSX), proceeds are in USD.

This will allow you to do the currency conversion without paying the 2-3% your bank or broker is charging you.  The only fee is the trading fee (just like any other stock transaction).  Your broker may require that you hold DLR until the trade settles before being able to sell it."
6/14/2021 18:13,stocks,How do I sell as DLR.U? I dont even see the option to do that with my broker. Usually when I buy something I cant sell it as something else
6/14/2021 18:50,stocks,"Sorry, I think it might be DLR-U, but may depend on your broker.

Here are the steps I follow:
1. Buy DLR in my CAD account
2. Transfer to USD account
3.  Enter a sell order for DLR-U.  Note that it does not show as DLR-U in my account, but I can enter a sell order for DLR-U and have it go through.  I learned this by calling the broker.

Another option you have is to by a stock that is listed on both the TSX and NYSE.  Take TD as an example, say 500 shares.
1.  Buy 500 TD on the TSX in your CAD account.
2. Journal the shares to the NYSE listing in your USD account.  You own 500 shares regardless on the currency.
3.  Sell your TD shares on the NYSE.  Proceeds are in USD.

The downside with the TD (or other stocks) is the volatility.  Your broker may make you hold the shares before you journal them and the trade could go against you before you can make the sale (it could also move in your favour too).
Some brokers will do this for you on the phone (journal and sell) without waiting for the trade to settle.  Best bet is to make a call and ask how you can execute Norbert’s gambit.  Most are familiar with it since it is a fairly common strategy to avoid large currency transaction fees."

So if you're looking to keep that, but add diversification then you will want to add a U.S. Large Cap Fund, and a extra U.S. equity fund.

VTI wouldn't make sense because VSEQX already gives you exposure to small and Midcap stocks, and that is the difference between VTI and VOO. 

VOO works if you want an ETF, or VFIAX if you want the mutual fund. Sometimes mutual funds can be better because you can set up recurring purchases and buy fractional shares.akes it super easy to automate your investing.

VEU (ETF) or VFWAX (mutual fund), give you exposure to non U.S. stocks."

It's innately more diversified than picking one stock, but being all stock and just one instrument means the real risk is twofold:

First, the entire market could tank, taking everything in the fund down and losing all the gains.

Second, the fund could fail in some way, due to mismanagement or legal problems.

Splitting this money up into more than one find reduces the latter, and shifting some to something other than equities would help with the former."

Mutual funds can fail. It doesn't happen often, but it's a risk that's easy to reduce by getting part of the money to another fund.

If you're already effectively diversified by having significant money in a house or cash then you're good, but if that fund is 99% of your assets it's a case-study waiting to happen."
6/14/2021 11:25,stocks,Im 23 i didn’t even know i had assets until 2 weeks ago. That fund itself doesn’t even have a stock be worth over 1% of the fund. I think my plan is just to let it sit there another 5-10 years and put it in a 401k when i get a job after graduate school
6/14/2021 16:03,stocks,"You don't put things in a 401k. Your employer does. It comes out of your pay, and they usually match part of it.

Then when you leave the job you roll it over into an IRA, and start a new 401k at your new job.

These shares are probably in a taxable account. At your tax bracket now, the tax rate will be low if you sell some of it. Maybe lower than you'll pay in retirement. But probably not lower than if you wait til a year after the basis date (the day it transferred to you, check the paperwork) and it becomes a long-term holding.

6/13/2021 20:41,stocks,"I agree with Udnt- I’ve been using WS for over a year and absolutely love it, also saving tons in fees allowing me to trade even more often!

6/14/2021 10:00,stocks,"Your friend is delusional.. that makes no sense.

I've used wealth simple for 4 years. It holds my RRSP and IRA, while my 401k sits in fidelity due to reasons I have no complaints about wealth simple. Using their robo advisors is how I started to learn about the stock market. Would recommend"
6/14/2021 13:11,stocks,"Your friend is wrong, as it is illegal for Wealthsimple to basically steal your money secretly like that. I'm pretty sure Wealthsimple makes most of their money from conversion fees and premium subscriptions. Most people will reccomend you only buy Canadian stocks with it, but I buy anything and I really don't mind the 1.5% conversion fee when buying US stocks."
6/13/2021 21:46,stocks,Your friend is mistaken. You pay like $0.15/100 shares. That's the fee market makers pay wealthsimple so that they route your orders to them. So its definitely orders of magnitude cheaper than using TD or even CIBC. Only downside is no fundamentals or options or even many tickers but whatever it's free right. The ultimate broker for canadians is interactive brokers tho. Basically no commissions and all the features you could want
6/13/2021 20:42,stocks,"Emphasis on Canadian stocks and I'm pretty sure Canada doesn't have a PDT, pretty sure that rule is American. 

If OP is looking to purchase stocks not listed in CAD, Questrade would be the better option. Charging the exchange fee for a buy/sell everytime would be more than paying a 9.95 fee."

I’m new to this whole thing and that still eludes me.

6/13/2021 21:10,stocks,Thanks!

6/13/2021 20:43,stocks,"It applies to American too, I’ve been day trading the meme stocks multiple times a day with no restrictions. The exchange fee is less then 0.03% so it’s not bad at all. When I buy I pay 1.22% on exchange and when I sell I receive 1.19% on exchange"
6/14/2021 11:53,stocks,"It depends on the size of his porfolio. I have small position sizes and use wealthsimple for american holdings because the 1.5% fee is less than $9.95. Plan to switch to Questrade once my account gets bigger.

6/14/2021 11:14,stocks,Cool I didn't now PFOF was illegal in Canada
6/13/2021 23:14,stocks,This is awful. On a 10k usd trade buy you're paying 12200 and on the sell getting back 11900 for a 300$ loss. Norberts gambit on dlr is like 40$ fees back and forth at any of the big 5 and like 20-25$ at questrade.
6/14/2021 12:07,stocks,But you can't hold USD in Wealth simple so you're paying it again to exchange back to CAD as soon as you sell. In Questrade you can settle the transaction in USD and pay an exchange fee once.

6/14/2021 10:35,stocks,That is exactly what I want. Can you help me set that up? I didn’t see any options for that in through the app. Maybe I’m looking for the wrong thing?
6/13/2021 23:19,stocks,"Except you pay the big 5 fee on Canadian trades too where as WS Is 100% free for those. I’m Canadian so it suits me better then any other broker.

It all depends what market you prefer to trade in"
6/14/2021 12:59,stocks,Yeah but you pay a commission fee on the sell too right? So its either 1.5% or $9.95 per transaction. In my case 1.5% is less than 9.95. Like I said I have a smaller portfolio and am still building it out. Once 9.95 becomes less than 1.5% I plan to move all my US holdings into Questrade.
6/14/2021 10:47,stocks,"I actually can't..

I'm in the US and wealth simple is transferring all its accounts to betterment here. That exchange is happening today, so it's the 1 day where we are all unable to touch our accounts.

Timing lol."
6/13/2021 23:21,stocks,If you only trade in CAD it's fine but us market is where the money is at and ws isn't a viable option since they're scraping 1.5% each transaction
6/14/2021 13:25,stocks,So your portfolio is less than $663? 1.5% on $663 is $9.95 which is what a lot of the big 5 banks charge for commission per buy/sell.
6/14/2021 13:28,stocks,My postions typically are less than $663. I also like to add in stages as opposed to trying to time it perfectly.
6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"Thoughts on Treasuries? It seems the market has quickly transitioned from being worried about inflation to being worried about deflation. As a result treasury yields are falling causing bond ETFs to trend upward. What are everyone’s thoughts on investing in bonds right now, how long do you expect this trend to continue, and what indicators do you expect to predict a trend reversal."
6/13/2021 20:30,stocks,It's impossible for anyone to accurately predict interest rates (and therefore bond prices). What we do know is that low yields = low reward and high risk. The ONLY option in my opinion is to buy Treasury Inflation Protection Securities (TIPS). While the yield is low (all safe bonds have low yields now) it provides some protection from deflation and a great deal of protection from runaway inflation. Many portfolio would benefit from having a small percentage invested in TIPS because they have a low correlation with many other investments typically in a portfolio. Here is more information on TIPS and how they function: https://www.arborinvestmentplanner.com/treasury-inflation-protected-securities-tips-benefits-buy/
6/13/2021 20:32,stocks,"I’ve had calls on TLT since mid-May. People are still bought into the reflation narrative, once CPI cools off rates will come back down.

But I’m invested on a bet the economy turns to shit this year. We’re really better off than we were in 2019, when rates were last this high? Yeah rights. Supply chain and transportation are getting backlogged, oils through the roof, labor force participation is getting worse. Rent and eviction moratoriums coming to an end, as well as extra unemployment dropping.

Plus the Fed has made it clear they will only act as a janitor if things turns sour. They haven’t even tried to explain why the circumstances that lead to QE6 came about."
6/14/2021 10:24,stocks,The insurance that TIPS provide against inflation is not free. Essentially you are paying a premium to bet that inflation will exceed market expectations (I predict the opposite). TIPS usually underperform treasuries for that reason and tend to be more volatile during financial crises. They are overpriced right now as indicated by the [TIPS 10 year yield spread](https://ycharts.com/indicators/10_year_tipstreasury_breakeven_rate) and I believe TIPS funds will see a strong correction as deflation gets priced in.
6/14/2021 7:49,stocks,"Which one was QE6?

The circumstances for Fed buying up paper have been obvious since March 2020: Coronavirus depression prevention, and until January an administration with a thumb up its ass.

Most of that would be unwinding now, if the public hadn't preemptively sold off bonds and raised yields from August to January."
6/13/2021 20:21,stocks,"I appreciate your take. I should say I expect inflation for things like housing and vehicles to continue with the price surges of materials such as lumber and steel. However, the pandemic accelerated the acceptance of technologies which have the potential to reduce prices of staples. Even if deflation is a distant concern, it seems like it is being priced in now, or maybe, inflation fears are being priced out."
6/14/2021 11:44,stocks,"I agree that if you believe strongly that deflation is coming you would favor long term Treasuries over TIPS. I believe any coming deflation will be very short lived because the Federal Government will do everything they can to stop it. I""m not saying that is good, I just believe the long term odds are for inflation over deflation. However, like I said, it's impossible for anyone to accurately predict and therefore we have to make asset allocation decisions that reflect that uncertainty. Good discussion!"
6/14/2021 9:28,stocks,"The QE that started in March was the 6th iteration done by the US Fed, despite what they might claim.

The Fed buys paper to prop up the treasury market after a mass sell off occurs. Why did the mass sell off happen, and how can it be prevented in the future? Your guess is as good as mine, but the Fed has published nothing to that effect.

> Most of that would be unwinding now, if the public hadn't preemptively sold off bonds and raised yields from August to January.

I don’t agree with the reasoning, but that aside, you think the failures of the Fed are because of the public? What?"
6/13/2021 20:26,stocks,"Deflation will come eventually but I wouldn't worry about it, I expect commodities to continue their run through this year, as for housing I believe we are in the middle of a forming bubble, if the fed fails ro raise rates and keeps them too low for too long then we have another bubble on our hands. I don't really understand your point ""the pandemic accelerated the acceptance of technologies which have the potential to reduce prices of staples"" so if you could clarify what you ment by that?"
6/14/2021 13:24,stocks,Well-said. I'll consider allocating toward them in the future.
6/14/2021 9:43,stocks,"The public sold bonds for several months starting 8/20. This caused a rise in bond yields. Some sellers even shorted bonds.

The likely reason for this was the growing certainty that vaccines would be ending the pandemic lockdowns and the Fed would be unwinding its balance sheet, cratering bond valuations. Non-Fed owners got out ahead of that.

The Fed, meanwhile, stopped panic-buying in July and in August started a slower, consistent acquisition program that has not stopped or varied pace since then. It's probable this shift in strategy catalyzed the public perception that the buying could become selling at any time.

So whatever you're calling QE6 didn't happen this year, it happened last year and is still ongoing and the reasons it started were obvious, it's just not obvious why it's still happening."
6/13/2021 21:35,stocks,"Simply put, technology improvements lower production/delivery costs which in turn lower the cost of goods. That’s the theory at least."
6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"Opinions on ASO (Academy Sports & Outdoors Inc) YTD it is one of the best performing stocks in 2021 ($21.19  01/04/21 and on $41.71  06/11/2021). 

Not to sound like a rookie in investing, been investing since 2017 in individual stocks - but it is one of the very few times I have seen a stock be doing so good YTD, and still being shown as ""undervalued"" by Yahoo Finance. To add to this, Yahoo Finance shows them short/mid term continuing to go upward. 

If I was to venture as accurate of a guess as I could, I would say this stock come 11/01/2021 will be easily able to supersede $60. I may poor $4k into it and let it ride until beginning of November, may hold longer. 

Seems like a hidden gem tbh, gives me vibes of Chipotle years ago."
6/13/2021 20:28,stocks,"maybe the best way to get a perspective on ASO is to look at SPWH. which was acquired by America outdoors group. for 785  mil.

SPWH total assets 706 mil, Total liabilities 492 giving it a book value of 214 mil. P/Book 3.7x 

SPWH revenue 1,532 mil. net income 103 mil. price paid was 0.51 x revenue and P/E. 7.6

SPWH 3y revenue growth rate 21.49, 3y net income growth rate 72.7, ROIC 20.74% 

ASO market cap 3.841B

ASO total assets 4,384 mil, Total liabilities 3,272 mil giving it a book value of 1,112 mil. P/Book 3.9x

ASO revenue 6,113 mil. net income 497 mil. P/S 0.64 and P/E 7.88

ASO 3y revenue growth rate 5.57, 3y net income growth rate 76.82, ROIC 17%

&#x200B;

It looks like ASO is fully valued at the moment, though not over valued. If ASO continues to grow as it has in the past shares will appreciate along with the company. The 5y P/E average for SPWH was 12 so the market could value ASO even more than it currently is."

i know it's a lot and it's pretty basic. even referrals to links would be appreciated."
6/13/2021 22:03,stocks,Probably not.. some of us just need the market to show us how wrong we are in thinking we know what's going to happen next. Unfortunately it can be a very expensive lesson
6/14/2021 6:04,stocks,"VOO is the good answer. I prefer BKLC myself because its more concentrated. Top 200 stocks rather than 350. Also zero fees though VOO is low fee anyway.

Do not stick your head int he sand. Avoiding forums and sites because some people give bad advice is not smart. Do read it all but just remind yourself not to believe it all. 

Treat analysts and fund managers the same you treat Reddit posters, they are just as idiotic despite their profession and the suit they wear. Dont take their credential seriously nor should you believe their performance if they boast. 

Read, listen, learn, and analyze things yourself to find out what is true and what isnt."
6/14/2021 12:13,stocks,"It all depends on your personal circumstance and risk tolerance.

If you earning enough income and can afford to be in the red for a while, then you can risk big. (if you looking for massive gains, going all in on one stock is the way, but it risky).

If you want to get around 10% a year on average, go for etfs.

But whatever your circumstance, keep cash aside as the real massive losses occur if you ever forced to sell quickly when market is down.

In short, make sure you have a decent cash savings before investing. Either way you choose how to invest."

6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"ETN question This might sound like a stupid question to some, but my knowlage on ETN's isn't the best. Take a look at Microsofts stock, (I would post a picture if it was allowed here) it literally only goes up. 

Microsoft seems like an incredibly safe bet. So my question is basically, why doesn't everyone just buy Bull ETN's with gearing to increase their returns? I know ETN's are more risky, and volatility is your enemy, but microsoft isn't very volatile at all. Scrolling throught some Bull ETN's on microsoft It seems like you would make money on almost any time frame. More money than just buying the stock."
6/13/2021 20:41,stocks,"I mean I totally get that a stock like microsoft could fall in the future. But you're not supposed to hold ETN's for years either. ETN's are generally shorter term (depending on the gearing). Lets say you buy 3x Bull on microsoft and hold for 3ish months each trade. And continue to do this. Most times you will make a profit no? Take this stock as an example: [https://gyazo.com/326215e5121936c487015fc5ee6fe18b](https://gyazo.com/326215e5121936c487015fc5ee6fe18b)

This is the 6month chart. If you look at the ""all time"" chart it looks even better, but anyways. Looking at that chart, if you had to bet money on it going up or down the next 2 months, wouldn't you bet it would go up? And I know you could be really unlucky and it could crash, but lets say you follow this strat every 2 months on super safe stocks like the one in the example. Over time you will make profit wont you? I mean, I know it sounds stupid to buy a stock because it only goes up, but based on trends an probabilities, everything suggests the price of that stock will continue to point upwards. Atleast with a shorter timeframe like 2 months. 

I also know the stock market is really bloated right now which will perhaps increase the risk, but I'm talking generally here. I'm trying to figure out if a strategy like this could be viable in the long term. 

Heres an example of the stock in mention. 

Holding the underlying stock itself for 3 months would give you ca 15% return. 

[https://gyazo.com/54d4a9956de99ea58620fa4de2cafe4a](https://gyazo.com/54d4a9956de99ea58620fa4de2cafe4a) 

Holding a 3X Bull ETN instead for 3 months would give you a 55% return. 

[https://gyazo.com/2bdabe09a4c969ca6499bedd73a6d4fd](https://gyazo.com/2bdabe09a4c969ca6499bedd73a6d4fd) 

The company in mention is in finance, safe, and has minor volatility. Im looking at the 3 month chart here, but it really doesn't matter which timeframe you choose, it will still give profits. Thing is, ETN's are considered extremely risky because of how volatility effects it, but buy buying safe stocks, or even better, indexes like s&p 500, that volatility risk is reduced alot. And guys like buffet always goes on about how buying safe indexes is the way to go, but why not gear that sh\*t up 3x times to net yourself more profits?"
6/13/2021 20:51,stocks,"I can see you've put a lot of thought into this and I can see how that makes a lot of sense.  From an odds perspective it makes a lot of sense. Realistically there are only a few times this could go bad on you over the last 10 yrs.  But I would point out almost all of these have come in the last 3 yrs - there's been one big index drop a yr since 2018.  

This could make it a very high probability bet, but this isn't really the same as a ""Safe bet"".  It's a pretty risky bet in that if there was to be some kind of shock being in an ETN could give you more exposure and being in a stock that was highest performing could have the sharpest pullback.  

In general I think the markets have gotten a bit too rich and I also have some concerns about how [ETFs and ETNs may pose some broad market risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeatTheBear/comments/nwbn81/do_etfs_pose_systematic_risk_research_paper/).  I may be overly cautious. And I do agree if you'd done this in the past it would have worked out really well.

Although there is misleading news by media and other sources, shouldn’t the retail investor do his own independent research extensively? After all it is his money he’s putting at risk... with all this inflation, asset prices rising and rates inevitably due to rise, how can the retail investor not suspect something is going on..? Investing at this top seems insane.

It’s like feeling bad for someone who’s heavily in debt but the minute he pays off his car he goes back to the dealership to buy another brand new one, back into the never ending cycle of debt of financially illiterate people.

Because there's a good chance that the market, as overvalued as it is, with all the risks that come from rising interest rates, will just keep on rising as it has been, and you'll be the one losing money from your shorts and puts when you try to time everything.

Sure, one can just not touch the stock market at all. But good luck dealing with the rising inflation everyone is so afraid of. Maybe you'll be able to buy some good bonds if the Feds do raise interest rates. Until then, good luck.

6/14/2021 1:13,stocks,"Because crashes don't last forever, and if they do, you probably have bigger things to worry about than your brokerage account.

Everyone can hedge against downturns, and many do, the issue is that it's extremely difficult to accurately know when a crash will happen. Any money you spend hedging against a crash is money that isn't making you more profits now. However, it doesn't hurt to have some means to hedge against downturns. Options provide a good way to do this. However, often you need to more use stategies that limit loss in case of a downward drop rather than those that profit from a downward drop as that only generally works if you have a very good idea of when the drop will occur (ideally within a month) and how much the drop will be. If you know that, then something like [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/option-finder.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/option-finder.html) tells you exactly what put option or bullish spread to buy to maximize gains from the drop (naked calls are generally a very bad idea for most). Of course, if you are wrong, then you'll lose money, how much depends on how far the price drops. You can also simply close out positions you think will drop, but again, that's there's a cost there too, the opportunity cost of not having those positions.

Really for the vast majority of long term investors, the goal is to ensure that you have the means to take advantage of any massive dip in price and buy at the discount, the prices generally go back up unless there is something fundamentally wrong with the company that has been revealed by the crash. There are plenty of recommendations online for how to buy the dip of crashes to gain from the recover, most of them related to using some percentage of your cash to buy more as the price drops in certain percentage intervals."

The more prices continue to go up before the drop, the more it makes sense to hold or buy your current positions. The sooner the drop occurs, the more it makes sense to buy OTM put options. However, put options work best if you have a good idea of how far the price will drop and by when. Otherwise, you may lose money even if you are right, simply by timing it wrong."

6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"Banks being seriously challenged on Comex. Huge rise in open interest last 3 days! 
On the Comex open interest rises when the price rises and falls when the price drops. Banks are the sellers when new buyers enter. This causes open interest to rise. The banks have been very quick to follow any price rises with sell offs to force out new buyers. The selloffs lower open interest as the stopped out longs sell to banks covering shorts.

 When the squeeze first started open interest was 173 thousand. It rose 10 thousand to 183 thousand before the criminal banks slammed the price. As price of silver was pushed down to $24 the banks engineered a drop in open interest to 150 thousand. Dropping open interest means banks are reducing their short position. Open interest has been rising as the price of silver has risen back to $28


Over the last three days open interest on the Comex has risen dramatically by 13,900 contracts. That's almost 70 million ounces. Banks have seriously added to their short positions as they fight the battle over $28 silver. Open interest is now at 198,791 contracts. This is over 15,000 contracts more than the high before the the February criminal smash!  The last three days weren't typical up days that cause open interest to rise!

Wednesday rallied overnight before silver was pushed down all day. Thursday silver was sold hard into the CPI release after which it rose with banks fighting every penny! Again Friday it rose overnight and was pushed down all day. Banks seem desperate to push silver below $28.

The macro backdrop is becoming increasingly bullish for silver. Real interest rates are becoming increasingly negative. This seems to be giving the hedge funds some testicles in terms of their willingness to challenge the banks. The macro back drop also increases physical demand from wealthy investors as well as sovereigns like China. 

Next week we get PPI on Tuesday and Fed day on Wednesday. Even the government lies about PPI are likely to be very bullish for silver though that wouldn't stop banks from selling anyways! The Fed is trapped and can't fight the inflation horror show with rising interest rates without collapsing the stock market. Maybe a mini stock sell off before the Fed says just kidding in order to shake off some silver longs?  Pressure is building on the banks! At some point banks will be forced to cry uncle and then price explodes. Could it be next week?

1. Yes selling them will trigger a taxable event, namely capital gains taxes.
   1. If you had them for over 1 year, then its long term capital gains.
   2. Otherwise its short term capital gains
2. If you have no income, the 1st $40k of long term capital gains have 0% tax. $80k if married. After that its 15% which is not bad anyway.
3. Diversification is always good for new investors.

All that said, given that no one can predict the markets and you need a place to live, probably better to sell them especially if you know you have no other income coming.

Many people use them for gambling but thats not what I’m going to talk about here, these things were invented to serve as a form of insurance to bring stability to markets and thats how you can use them to generate risk free income on a stock you own. (Yes I said risk free keep reading)

Okay, in this explanation there are two characters

*A farmer* who is going to sell a call option

*A baker* who is going to buy a call option

Every year in our town the price of wheat fluctuates wildly, if the harvest is good the price falls, if its bad the price soars, and its hard for people to plan next years expenses.

Farmers want to know before they plant how much they’ll make per bushel of wheat, and bakers want to know in advance how expensive the ingredients for the flour will be.

Our farmer can operate comfortably at $10 a bushel, and our baker cannot afford to stay in business if the price of wheat rises above $12 a bushel.

The farmer sells the baker a contract that gives the baker the right, but not the obligation, to buy the wheat at $10.

The farmer makes some money from the baker upfront on the contract. (This is the premium you make on a covered call)

If the price of wheat is **below** $10 at harvest, the baker would not exercise his contract, and would pay the cheaper marker price for wheat, he lost some money on the worthless contract BUT it served as insurance while it lasted.

If the price if wheat is **above** $10 the baker would exercise his contract and buy at a discount, the farmer lost out on potential gains from the high price BUT the premium he got for the contract reduces this loss, and he is confortable selling at the price anyways.

**This last part is key** because you’re the farmer in this scenario, I never sell a covered call at a price below what I’d happily sell for. Instead of holding a stock from $5 to $10 and selling, instead you sell covered calls at $10 and get your $10+ a premium if it hits that number, or you keep your stock and your premium if it doesn’t and you do it again until it rises.

If the stock never rises, the premiums you make from covered calls effectively lower your cost basis and generate profits that you otherwise would not have by simply holding a stagnant stock.

The reason I called this risk free is as follows

People will tell you that you lose if the contract is exercised because you could have sold higher, and I’m telling you that you probably would not have. Don’t use these to gamble, find a price and time frame that you would consider the stock overpriced at. Say I have a stock at $27, if it runs to $40 by January I would sell because I don’t think enough could happen in that time to justify that price.

Well if thats true then you would miss out on any profits after that point anyway so those aren’t real losses. Replace your limit sell with a covered call and enjoy the exact same profit on the sale if you hit that price, plus the call premium."

6/13/2021 20:31,stocks,Come again?
6/13/2021 21:51,stocks,"Yes, but before that happens, you can ""buy to close"" the contract.  Usually, i do that and immediately sell another at a higher strike and sometimes for a later date. That way, I don't lose my shares and continue to make money from them."
6/14/2021 4:18,stocks,"How do you fix it so that you make more money “selling to open” than you pay “buying to close”? Is it if the stock price goes down you make money by essentially shorting it? Also, when you sell a call, do you sell with net debit or net credit?"
6/14/2021 9:44,stocks,"Don't short anything.  You buy to close and sell another to open. The farther out you sell a call, the more expensive it is because of intristic/ time value. So if you buy to close one that you sold for June  and sell another to open for July or September, you should collect a premium again."
6/14/2021 9:52,stocks,"It can be very confusing. Lurk in r/thetagang. Also look it up on investopedia and perform a paper trade. Write down an actual sell to open call. Watch it, if the strike gets too close, buy to close and sell another further out and/or up."

I would short GME and AMC, but I have no idea when they will correct, and also am aware that their stock prices are not driven by fundamentals. I could be paying for months in premiums before I have a shot at any return.

I am definitely keeping my eye on these meme stocks even though I haven't figured out a strategy yet, but am curious as to what everyone is doing about it.

Edit: I thought this was r/stocks not wallstreetbets. This post is 14% upvoted which probably means GME bots are downvoting this post to enforce their trading strategy.

So here's my friendly advice, as someone paying a lot of attention to GME.  FFS do not try to predict the downfall and think you can profit off of it by shorting. Yes you could get it right and get to brag about it later.  Or it could go very very very wrong for you. Extremely risky move. Do what above said, and/ or spend some time looking around trying to predict what small or mid cap stock you like could hit next and buy some of that before it runs. Join the circus. 

Understandable if you don't want to buy into GME at the current valuation. But that doesn't mean you are obligated to take the opposite side of that trade."

6/14/2021 0:00,stocks,"Hostess Brands (TWNK): Follow-Up to my Long Thesis Posted in February DD ***TL;DR:*** ***Short interest has only increased to \~20%, 3-month average daily volume has only decreased to \~1.3mm shares per day (would take shorts 17 days to cover), and it's Pride Month (Twinks are gay men with boyish qualities) so we're social justice heroes if we buy (can't wait for the news to explain Twinkies). I believe the stock is structurally short because of Environmental, Social, Governance limitations by smart money, which only leaves a great buying opportunity for retail investors.***

My prior post from February 2021: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lafmq2/long\_thesis\_on\_hostess\_brands\_twnk\_owner\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lafmq2/long_thesis_on_hostess_brands_twnk_owner_of/)

What's up! In light of Pride Month and the recent posts on TWNK, I figured I would provide a quick update from my old post on the name. I continue to be excited, and long, holding common stock, warrants, and August call options.

**> Short Interest**: Has only **increased** from 15% in February to 20% Today

\> **Average Daily Volume**: Has only **decreased** from 1.4mm shares per day in February to 1.3mm shares per day Today (based on 3-month average volume). However, over the last 10 days average daily volume has spiked to 2.9mm shares.

**> Thoughts on Short Thesis:** I think the high short interest is driven by Environmental / Social / Governance issues, which are all the rage these days and every credible financial institution now has these limitations when investing. TWNK sells ""unhealthy foods"", which is probably what drives institutions to short the name, and also to *not buy* the name (thus the stock price could be artificially depressed). This may be a great opportunity for us, where these political factors, not fundamentals, are influencing the stock price. Given WSB is not bound by this, there may be upside here for us retail investors.

**> Thoughts on Meme-ability:** It's Pride Month, and a Twink, for those who don't know ""is usually considered a homosexual male with attractive, boyish qualities. Typically from the ages of 18-25, and often thought as a young, white, fashionable male."" Buying TWNK is also supporting Pride Month.

**> Thoughts on TWNK Moon Potential:** TWNK received  a little traction in the last week (search TWNK on Reddit), and the stock jumped as high as \~8% on Wednesday (June 9th). There is such little volume that a bit of traction on Reddit can really move the stock."

Not looking for TA, just the symbol and a brief explanation of why you are bullish.

My #1 pick that I have not pulled the trigger on is $ASML. Reason I'm bullish is they basically have a monopoly on the equipment necessary to manufacture semiconductors and we all know about the chip shortage at this point.

Also looking at $CAT because the whole reopening of the economy in the post COVID environment where I see upgrading existing infrastructure/creating more will be in much higher demand than it was throughout 2020. And you typically need a quality bulldozer or two to pull that off.

Yes I could just lump it into a broad market index but I already have like 90% of my non-emergency capital invested into $VOO. Still relatively young and am not afraid of some risk with this money.

I've been pretty heavily researching bio-printing technologies (3D printing skin and bones and other organs). It's a technology I was fascinated by 10 years ago when I heard about it on NPR, and now the tech is finally coming to the commercial markets. 

I expect it will take a little while, but CLLKF is poised to make a big break. They provide printers and proprietary processes to tons of major research universities and have a contract to provide bio-printed skin to health and beauty companies like Johnson and Johnson. They're sitting on a jillion patents and you can literally get your own natural bones 3D printed in San Diego RIGHT NOW for a bone graft in your jaw. 

Those who know, seem to think the sector is going to grow a lot in the next few years. 
CFMS looks like another wise choice in that space, and MTLS is positioning themselves to be a main provider of the machinery and hydrogels necessary when bio-printing becomes a really common procedure.

Then they continued to deleverage until their portfolio became miniscule compared to before.  mREITs are unique in that you can judge the stock price by the book value of their portfolio.  This is why it is futile to look at the past chart and say IVR will be back to its former glory.  They no longer have the assets."

Airlines: United and Delta have come back pretty well. Again, still room. American Airlines?

Hotels: I believe the larger hotel chains got some serious help from the government. Any good buys here?

Cruiselines: Carnival? Norwegian? Royal Caribbean is already pretty high at almost $100 per share. 

Would love to hear what everyone’s thoughts are on these industries."
6/13/2021 20:22,stocks,Cruises are a bad investment right now due to all the dilution.
6/13/2021 21:09,stocks,"Airlines are still a gamble since they make their money from business travelers and they have not really come back.    Price is still below pre-covid by a decent amount.

Hotels doing good, for some chains still a worry because of business travelers.  Major ones are already above pre-covid price, so skipping.

Cruiselines.  I love cruise stocks, made abunch of money last year from buying/selling the bounces.  When the bouncing stopped I purchased alot more for the post-covid jump.  I sold all of mine already because people are STUPID.  There is no way these stocks should this high, cruises are still having issues getting started, they diluted and got millions in loans and then they sold lots of ships so the overall profit will be lower."
6/13/2021 23:15,stocks,"Airlines shares are definitely on the pricier side at the moment with I think most hugging their highs. While that might lead to some short term floundering or crabbing, the future is looking pretty bright across the board from the ULCCs to the legacies. At the bleakest point, I think people were ambulance chasing AAL. In an ideal world, I think the play is companies such as Textron (TXT) who manufacture private jets that will really eat the market share of business travel. Alternatively, Frontier (ULCC) or Spirit (SAVE) might have the most upward potential as people want to travel while on a tighter budget and solely to vacation destinations.

Lastly, I think Air Lease (AL) could also be a partial and last ditch reopening play as national carriers around the globe look to bounce back in the new order of air travel as different countries reopening at different rates."
6/14/2021 6:08,stocks,"Yep I agree. Cruise is over valued right now.

Airlines are back to old levels too so not much upside there either but thanks for the 100% gain. 

Hotels are all over the place so it depends on which one you are talking about."
6/14/2021 1:25,stocks,"I agree. I can’t believe how high the cruise lines are given how much they’ve spent to stay afloat the past 15 years.

It isn’t that business revenue won’t be improving in the next year, it’s that investors have already priced the stock so high pre-recovery."

They just treated me like some crazy Karen.

Luckily(?) I was able to sell it later for something like $150 profit. If the order had gone through when I got the error it would have been over $7000 profit.

I hold long term so this really does not matter for me, to day traders it might be a problem (but again, it's very rare to have this occur from my experience).

Customer support is a hit or miss. Emailing questions is crap in my opinion. Usually if it's something important, I give them a call and I usually do not have that long of a wait time and I get excellent service, to my standard. Sometimes you have to wait very long, which I do not appreciate

Their mobile app is crap, would not recommend lol. Crap as in UI is wonky, everything is confusing, I can only see so little things at a given time. Stick to desktop."

I always imagined we were the quietest users. Boomers always, pros and rh all touting something. I don’t think E*TRADE stands out for anything except good marketing 10 years ago, first one being born on the internet? and being all around generally acceptable. Customer service is fine etc

Edit: Now that I think about it; that really is their story. Before E*TRADE banks were named after combining old people’s names and regions. Now they’re going for niches and branding. But E*TRADEs differentiation is outdated now. They’re literally “hey look, we’re on the web!”"

**Research Tools** \- GuruFocus (not a broker but just great visualization of data but its not free). Runner Up: Interactive Brokers (due to international stock data)

**Friendliest Website** \- ETrade (By a big margin and I recommend it to new investors)

This is the reason.

RH's UX would be just as shitty as everyone else's if they'd started with the same frameworks.

And if the other brokers do decide to update, they won't shut off their old interfaces, they'll just give you the option to use the new one. TD Ameritrade had three full-blown desktop web interfaces before Schwab bought them. They didn't change a thing. Why? Because users who aren't complaining don't cost anything, and users who are complaining can try the new thing. If they tell all the users to change how they find data and move their money, it'd cost way more than the development costs."

6/13/2021 20:33,stocks,"Td has it? Is that old info or is it situational? Cause in the past few years I've had companies do reverse splits and buybacks, neither time did I have a fee appear on the account, nor was I forced to sell during the buyback"
6/13/2021 20:24,stocks,"What time are you placing those ""Good for day"" trades?  If it's close to market close, and your Limit price is too high, it won't execute.  I haven't had this happen under normal circumstances."
6/13/2021 20:31,stocks,"Are you referring to my market data being sold by eTrade (PFOF)?  In that case yes, and so do ""most"" brokers under varying circumstances, admittedly not all.  I also have accounts with Fidelity and Vanguard, so I understand the difference.  I agree PFOF is not good and I'm fine paying a reasonable price per trade if that prevents PFOF but until it's outlawed or restricted with regulation that forces true ""best price"" execution (which we don't get, as they call ""Premium price"" the actual best price), the brokers will keep doing it.  When I worked at the Pacific Stock Exchange I was reminded by a market maker on the floor that ""we don't create anything except profits from other people spending money.""  There are many middlemen in finance and they each need some way to take a piece of every transaction."
6/14/2021 0:05,stocks,Jokes on you as it's owned by Schwab. Only a matter of time that it's all consolidated
6/13/2021 22:41,stocks,"Shouldn’t be with any split. I recently has a reverse 1 for 10 stock split. There were no fees
charged by Schwab."
6/13/2021 20:33,stocks,Yes when there is a reorganization such as changing the ticker name it invokes the 38 dollar fee. I have some rocket spacs I need to sell before I get hit with that.
6/13/2021 20:19,stocks,Sounds like it’s the ACATS fee for transferring which is standard. I believe most brokerages will reimburse the ACATS fee. I think some require a certain amount to be transferred or a certain net worth. Regardless when you look for a new brokerage ask about them reimbursing you the fee
6/13/2021 22:14,stocks,I think IKBR is better than questrade. I use questrade heavily and looking to switch.
6/14/2021 0:10,stocks,A lot of pro traders that don't even use TOS for trading use it for their charting. It has best-in-class features and can do a million different things.
6/14/2021 13:19,stocks,I havent had any problems with their mobile app. Webull is far superior to RH just by the sheer amount of info they give compared to RH.
6/14/2021 1:05,stocks,"Fidelity Spire says “oops something went wrong” every time i try to use it. Fidelity investments looks fine in my opinion, especially if you click MORE in the bottom right and then turn on BETA in the top right corner.

What does spire do that investments app doesnt?"
6/13/2021 22:22,stocks,It's always clear before you execute which ones will have a fee
6/13/2021 22:21,stocks,Which is exactly why I switched from RH to Fidelity that day. Also learned RH hits you for a $75 transfer fee when all is said and done. Fidelity was nice about it and gave me time to set up my bank transfers to pay it off before the rest of my funds moved in.
6/13/2021 20:13,stocks,TD charged me $30 when I owned $15 worth of stock in a company that got bought out. That was annoying. They should have given me the chance to sell the stock at least.
6/14/2021 14:53,stocks,"I’m not familiar with Apex Clearing, what about them is bad?"
6/13/2021 20:28,stocks,Considered doing the same thing. Overall wahts the better platform? Fidelity or E-Trade?
6/14/2021 1:26,stocks,">Moved from E-Trade to fidelity and there's a couple things I miss 

Is you don't mind me asking, what do you miss?"
6/13/2021 20:03,stocks,"I have TD, RH, and Fidelity. I use TD most because they honestly have more stocks that I can't find in Fidelity. Same with RH. But I try not to use it much because of the terrible things I've heard about it. I didn't know about the fees either till now. But I haven't had to worry about that the last two years I've been using it 🤷 no probs with rh either..but I just keep it in mind every time I want to buy something."
6/13/2021 20:30,stocks,"I have nothing but good experiences with Fidelity. 
Yes, their mobile app and website need updating, but thats on the way."
6/13/2021 20:34,stocks,It happened to me in March or April 2020.
6/14/2021 17:03,stocks,TD charged me 38 for a reverse split in April 2021.
6/13/2021 20:30,stocks,Supposedly they well do it once. But then you are on the hook.
6/14/2021 0:03,stocks,"That's a better example, then. I was saying your 4 for 1 wasn't equivalent to /u/Gnobodyuknow and his 1 for 4."
6/13/2021 21:41,stocks,Unfortunate. I really like E*Trade because of their power app. This thread is definitely me rethink things.
6/13/2021 20:25,stocks,Thank you for the tip. I will.
6/14/2021 0:56,stocks,Yep. Worked for a large company that tried to improve their e-commerce UI from mid 2000s and it still has not been done.  Acquiring RH for a couple billion seems like an easier task.
6/14/2021 1:15,stocks,"For that project, it was a front end web app written in angular. But to display the charts I was just using an HTML Canvas element to display graphics which can be programmatically controlled by Javascript. No framework needed for that. All I did with Canvas was use the line function to draw lines from each datapoint to the next and display values being moused over. 

The code is literally just looping through the data points,  normalizing them as percentages so they can fit any size chart, maybe applying some filters (eg low pass or moving average) to smooth the curves if the data is really volatile (was the case with Megawatt load data), and then just drawing a line from one value to the next. 

Call that function as often as you want and you have real time data. This could be done in any web framework or anything that allows you to plot lines based on coordinates. Since you normalize the data nothing stops you from allowing deep zooms, and if you have a decent api you could be retrieving data many times a second to get good detail so zooming in continues to gives more information. 

I would often assign sliders to the variables in my normalization and low pass filters so I could see visually how these changes affect the data in real-time as I edit the values and that really helped to learn how digital signal processing methods affect charting.

Also, I'd bet there are a thousand libraries that would accept time series data and display charts with different settings without any of this low level line drawing business. But either way it's quite simple to display data any way you'd like."
6/14/2021 6:50,stocks,Yeah they have stop loss too RBC doesn't lol
6/13/2021 23:34,stocks,"I agree, its a start but RH is better still."
6/14/2021 13:22,stocks,"More than half the time if I'm in the option pane of an option I own and click on the stock name it gives an error ""NULL"" or ""NO DATA"". In order to see the stock chart I have to click ""back"" 3-5 times since Webull hides the bottom selector pane when you're in the options window. Trash UI for mobile as far as I'm concerned.

Like I said, their computer UI is great though due to the richness of info."
6/13/2021 23:29,stocks,Really... Yup it is a lot cleaner
6/14/2021 9:15,stocks,It's just meant to be a cleaner UI similar to RH.
6/14/2021 2:16,stocks,"theres a lot of nickel and dime you fees, I dropped them when I got charged 30$ for holding a stock that split. a 30$ service fee for a stock split that was worth less than 10$ absolutely absurd fees"
6/13/2021 22:40,stocks,This as well 👍🏻
6/14/2021 15:20,stocks,That’s good to know. I’ll check them out today. I have a question thought does fidelity have a education section on how to use their platform? Kinda like td Ameritrade has the Tos education.
6/14/2021 15:27,stocks,"They are part of the reason trades were stopped/restricted for certain stocks in Jan. If you go on any of the meme-stock subs and search apex, there will be a ton of info about everything. There's not a lot of trust behind them right now. 

There's currently a collusion investigation and lawsuit they they are a part of as well but that also includes about 30 other brokers."
6/13/2021 23:46,stocks,The iOS app shows a beta button that lets you try out the new trading experience.
6/14/2021 5:15,stocks,"Just get yahoo finance to watche the charts and place your orders by phone. Broker's a service, not an app. Forget about the confetti."
6/14/2021 3:07,stocks,"They have a more powerful interface called “power E*TRADE” which you need if your serious. It used to frustrate me toggling between the two apps, but then I see all these other gripes and it seems like a good compromise. One interface is easy and intuitive, the other is cluttered and powerful. This seems like the trend right. default interface for new users is simpler, and then they offer a more sophisticated version for power users."
6/13/2021 20:38,stocks,"For me. On desktop I think it's probably a wash. On the app they are different but I did prefer E-Trade (perhaps I'm still getting used to some things, tax lot selection, real time extended hours streaming). Overall I think the fidelity positives (fewer fees, same as my 401k, customer service which answered the phone and was helpful) made for an experience I was ok upgrading to."
6/14/2021 1:37,stocks,Was very easy to sell specific tax lots in the app in etrade to avoid wash sales. Fidelity has real time updates for your portfolio only during trading hours but not extended hours real time (shouldn't have to use stock twits). Few more layout things when trading in the app but the only guy me when using. Also the longer I'm in fidelity the more comfortable I get (or the more I forget etrade)
6/13/2021 20:51,stocks,"To buy International stock Fidelity is the worst. It’s a $50 fee to buy where as E*TRADE is $6.95 in and out. It all depends on what you are into, most of my OTC stock are International Helium companies and there really is no other option that’s better than E*TRADE. As for domestic stocks Fidelity is really good but their charts are god awful, Webull seems to be my fav right now, charts, information, it’s really impressive compared to Fidelity."
6/13/2021 22:19,stocks,If you have 10k in a stock it's not that big of deal but it is when you got 200 dollar shares like me. There are real costs involved when a stock splits or changes ticker symbols. It has something to do with the unique cusip number. It changes when there is a major change like splits or mergers. It's accounting things in think it should be less then 38 bucks. But honestly we are very spoiled with free trades. When I first started buying stocks it was 15 bucks a trade.
6/13/2021 20:31,stocks,"whatever, just don’t take everything on the internet as an attack why don’t you"
6/13/2021 23:35,stocks,"well, it still updates every 20 minutes and they are missing certain graphs but it's still miles better than their old app and they are taking feedback for the beta app. I submitted a few feature requests and bugs and they seem to be listening because their app has gotten better."
6/14/2021 12:24,stocks,Gotcha thank you
6/14/2021 15:37,stocks,"Oh yeah. They seem to have more resources focused on that than anything else. They also have chat CS available and many educational videos. I have not gotten brave enough to try option chains yet, but they have resources to educate you about it."
6/14/2021 5:16,stocks,"Yahoo finance, baby. Just hate that i have to restart it to update charts on home page. But yeah, broker is for making money, not looking at pretty pictures."
6/14/2021 0:12,stocks,"Thank you, sadly android doesn't at this time. Oh well!"
6/14/2021 6:11,stocks,"I actually use the desktop app, yahoo and google for info. I just don't always have the time to get on my PC during the week.thanks though!"
6/13/2021 22:27,stocks,I’m pretty sure I’ve traded OTC and international on Fidelity without said fees?
6/13/2021 23:17,stocks,"I have about 2k in IPOF, but even if it was 10k, I dont want to be charged for something like that is annoying af. Same goes for the reverse split thing Ive read.


And yeah, when I started investing, it was $7 per transaction lol. And I thought that was ridiculous already."
6/14/2021 10:19,stocks,Absolutely MILES better. The overall view is a bit different but that is just a matter of getting used to where things are in a new UI.
6/14/2021 16:22,stocks,Okay cool thanks
6/13/2021 20:07,stocks,Lol. Thats what i do too.
6/14/2021 0:14,stocks,Ah. Sorry to hear it. Hopefully soon. I think you’ll enjoy it. Much more clean and modern looking.
6/13/2021 23:32,stocks,The fee is on Foreign held stocks.  If they're held at DTC there's no $50 fee.
6/13/2021 23:32,stocks,"OTC more than likely, International it’s $50 this I am positive about. Regardless, I never said OTC for Fidelity, it was in the paragraph is all."
6/14/2021 0:54,stocks,schwab allows otc Canadian companies without a fee. fidelity may be the same. just watch on your order confirmation page...
6/14/2021 0:54,stocks,"TD Ameritrade has 2 mobile apps. One is the traditional app and the other is ThinkOrSwim. ThinkOrSwim is also available in the website. It’s widely considered one of the best charting tools available. 

You people are fucking idiots. Half of the available technical analysis tools were *invented* by Boomers. Literally every single broker has advanced charting tools available for free to literally everyone. 

Ironically, y’all are acting like Boomers. You have no clue how anything works but you demand they provide for your functionality that already exists, you’re just too dumb to figure it out."
6/14/2021 0:34,stocks,Robinhood mastered that UI. I still use it for quick tracking as well.
6/13/2021 23:13,stocks,Does getting gold change any of that?
6/14/2021 1:27,stocks,"Moomoo is similar to Webull. Looked identical not ling ago and easier on the eyes. They are also offering a feee Apple stock if you get 2 referrals this month.

That being said, I prefer Webull."
6/14/2021 0:16,stocks,"Thanks I'm looking forward to it, compared to Robinhood it is a rough looking app but it has quirks haha!"
6/14/2021 7:01,stocks,Yeah I think I'm ok. I just noticed I did buy some shares on Thursday and it doesn't look like I was hit with a fee. Now I know to watch for it though. Thanks!
6/14/2021 8:25,stocks,"I’m talking about design, not usefulness. There is no denying the TOS app is great. It just doesn’t look pretty, is complicated, and therefore is not going to attract young investors like Robinhood can."
6/14/2021 3:12,stocks,"If you were my dad, I’d have been raised right"
6/14/2021 0:51,stocks,"Nope. At least not for charting. It unlocks margin and shows you order book, but that’s it I think."
6/14/2021 3:15,stocks,This sounds like semantic jargon
6/14/2021 3:17,stocks,"It was late in the night, but I'm sure the sentense has more meaning than semantic jargon would have.

What exactly made you think that way?"
6/14/2021 4:19,stocks,"If you “buy stock” on robin hood and they aren’t clearing those on the open market, then they’ve bet against you. How they manage the risk doesn’t mean thats not what they’re doing. 

I don’t want to be too specific, because the structure of the market and order flow keeps changing and whatever I say will be outdated or honestly overstate my knowledge, or at a minimum I’ll be using jargon in a way that can be misconstrued. But the fact is, the big players are afraid to trade with each other because they’re always afraid their on the wrong side of the trade. But they will literally pay to trade with retail investors because the fact that retail investors are initiating the trade is all they need to know to confirm theyre probably making a good trade against a sucker.

Whether they sell this order flow or take the orders themselves or hedge is all just a shell game that will technically be slightly different in a year with tweaked jargon, but will be the same. Sharp money eager to trade with retail"
6/14/2021 4:36,stocks,"As a retail trader, one doesn't need magic to measure the quality of order execution. I believe that a good broker executes orders as close to the midprice as possible. I might be wrong, but this really isn't a hard metric to attach.

If RH users think that ""big money"" is screwing with their thousands, just check the execution quality, it will tell much more than any words. I don't use Robinhood and I don't plan to.

Also, as I mentioned in the comment above, there is a huge difference between market making and screwing clients. I don't think they're making any money from the hundreds of dollars of retail trading GME back and forth and neither are big players that move around milions of dollars. 

I think they make millions from gaining information on trades and future moves on the bigger scale"
6/14/2021 4:48,stocks,"Of course you are right in a technical sense.  But again, this is a veil of semantics over the same thing. How they monetize the information and position doesn’t change what’s really happening. 

Measuring price execution is a red herring. If those market prices were the whole story why don’t the funds trade with each other? Because they have decades of experience knowing that trading with other sharp money is at best a waste of time, if not outright dangerous. That’s why the most sophisticated traders have to put half their energy into disguising and executing trades in dark pools so they don’t tip their hand and distorting markets. 

That’s why if another fund says “sure, well buy $XX for $100 they’ll say, oh yeah? Actually I need $101” but if it’s a robin hood trader they don’t have to worry about asymmetric information so they’re essentially like shit, this must be garbage. “You can have it for $99”

Google “winners curse” for the broader concept of why sophisticated traders are reluctant to trade with other sophisticated traders (and you should be to). The main take away, is that the expected value of any trade you make is inversely correlated with how sophisticated your counter party is."
6/13/2021 23:42,stocks,Dems don't want people upset about prices and do want to reduce consumption.
6/14/2021 2:38,stocks,"Yep, look at fx. EQNR (disclaimer have a tiny position) but for me thats a half oil half green energy play, slow and steady they are moving into greener pastures."
6/14/2021 12:10,stocks,"You put way to much weight on “controversy” and I think…brand?

Investors in CVX and XOM are there for one reason - cashflows. At a decent oil price (like now) their valuation for cashflow is very very attractive, even if set to decline into the future. A year long protest outside their office in California doesn’t change cashflows at all

Remember, a peak oil demand in 2030 means we basically use as much oil in 2040 as today since we will be increasing until that point. That’s 20 years of runway to be at the same demand point. Yet their valuations assume their revenue dries up well before then.

I really think that’s a poor argument, things these companies did 20/30/40 years ago as the reason consumers will cut them out?  They haven’t yet, and have known those things for years. Even the “buried” reports from the 70’s by Exxon were widely know to governments, the public and all corporations by the mid 1990’s. No one changed anything then. People still know those affects of global warming and we don’t shut down airports, or implement high fuel taxes, or limit overpopulation etc.

Sort of a nonsensical argument you have"
6/14/2021 11:59,stocks,"Sure, the board seats may change the direction of the boat, but they aren’t throwing it into reverse. 

The board members fiduciary duty is to create value for shareholders. They convinced The big funds to support this because of poor XOM historical performance, not to gut the company and go green. Say they take that step and their finances suffer, Vanguard/Blackrock will dump them just as quick.

Engine 1 is about increasing returns(by promoting ESG practices), it’s not about divesting of oil assets that make up XOM."

For starters, ""adult"" companies don't use regular banks, there is a whole industry of payment processors and banks set up specifically for ""sin"" businesses that mainstream banks and payment processors don't want to have anything to do with for PR purposes. These alternate payment processors typically charge significantly higher fees than regular ones, and are immune to boycott pressures. These processors are also the same ones utilized by Subscribestar  and other people and organizations that have been blacklisted from modern society for wrong think.

Also, advertisers on adult sites don't give a damn about PR, their only concerned is not having their ads played on illegal content. That's it. If you're selling enlarging pills then all that's important is making the sale.

I recall it being marketed for the broad public 4 or 5 years ago (ie the Samsung Gear VR, lots of 360° videos appearing on YouTube, ... ). The whole thing didn't really catch on, mostly because of missing use cases, huge processing power requirements and people reporting nausea when using it. Now while I wouldn't compare it to the 3D TV, atm it's not more than a videogame genre, reserved to a fraction of gamers. The market is growing slowly compared to other digital trends and I don't see it reaching the average citizen in the next years.

6/14/2021 8:28,stocks,"Maybe not vr explicitly but that genre of communication and entertainment.  The desire for it is real, the tech just isn't ready yet for the exact reasons you stated.  I wouldn't say it's the next trend but I am watching for a few things to improve for it to start taking on its platform.

Look at how popular Pokémon go became.  People want to merge their digital lives with real life.

School classrooms, vacation, porn, gaming, exploration, military...there are just so many applications that could utilize vr and ar....but the tech.

Maybe there needs to be a sister tech to really push it forward.  Something that allows vr and AR to be experienced without the use of a device that is held or worn.  Basically it needs to be easier and less dorky for it to catch on.  Or possibly robots need to reach a better stage of development where they can be used in tandem with vr to achieve the results desired."
6/14/2021 1:44,stocks,"First off, your article listed as evidence is from a far left site, uses a photo of protesters from 1977 (it's such a niche thing to protest they couldn't even find a photo from the last 45 years of a protest) and the article has no evidence that PH removing unverified videos has anything to do with some sort of religious protesters.

From all accounts it's exactly the same as other video sites enforcing stricter controls over content for legal and business purposes. Given the nature of the website, it makes complete sense, even the biased article mention the issue with revenge videos uploaded by exes which is a serious problem and hard to track.

What surprises me is that Visa and MasterCard even processed their payments in the first place, most adult sites have to go through third-party payment processors, and the article even ends saying that Visa and MasterCard would be willing to restate their business with them pending review, making the idea of some sort of religious puritan boogeyman even more absurd"

See’s is shit, wrapped in a box.

In Buffett’s own words:

“The boxed-chocolates industry in which it operates is unexciting: Per-capita consumption in the U.S. is extremely low and doesn’t grow. Many once-important brands have disappeared, and only three companies have earned more than token profits over the last forty years.”

But wait, there’s more!

“...the bulk of its revenues from only a few states, accounts for nearly half of the entire industry’s earnings.”

It’s popular in a few states — a regional phenomenon — which has hardly managed 2% growth per year. It was only a worthwhile investment because it delivered consistent cash flow and it was able to raise prices while keeping costs in check. 

2% annual growth from 1972-2007 doesn’t even keep with inflation. He could have parked money in a savings account and earned more in the first 15 years."

6/13/2021 22:28,stocks,"Thank you for taking the time to reply to me. I am new to stocks but I have taken the time to fundamentally think about what stocks are and why they are valuable. I am aware that they represent ownership in a company. If an investor owns a lemonade stand, then they'd be foolish to sell the company for $100 when they could liquidate the lemonade stand's assets for $200. But this simplified scenario probably doesn't exist for publicly traded companies. I'm not so sure that for google or amazon it makes sense to value the company by their assets/earnings when there is zero way to access that. An investor can't feasibly liquidate the company, and they can't even hope to receive any of the earnings when they are anti-dividend companies. They just have to hope that the market continues to value the company based on the assets/earnings despite not having any actual access to that. If the market consisted of myself and clones of myself, the price of amazon and google would plummet unless they indicated to investors some sort of end game plan."
6/13/2021 23:01,stocks,"If you own stock, you are accessing earnings and asset growth, even if there is no dividend. 

Think of it this way. If there is a dividend, you have a choice what to do with your share of the company earnings. You can take that dividend money, spend it somewhere else. You can buy a coffee. You can buy a video game. You can invest in another company. That’s all your decision. 

If there isn’t a dividend, you are still getting a share of the company earnings. But you don’t have a choice, the decision has been made for you (by the majority owners via the board and handpicked CEO). Instead of you putting that money in your pocket and spending it on whatever you want, that dividend you would have received instead goes towards something the company believes is worthwhile. Maybe they buy a lemon grove. Maybe they buy some new juicing machines. Maybe they spend more for a new talented lemonade engineer. Maybe they build their war chest to buy out their closest competitor. Bottom line, instead of you taking your dividend and doing god knows what, they’re taking your dividend and growing the company. And assuming they make a wise decision, they make the company more valuable, because they either added valuable assets or added more earnings in the future. That added value is reflected in the share price, and that’s where you benefit. If you want to take that money out, you can do it at any time, by selling a portion of your stock. 

I’ll say it again, stock is ownership. Even if you have one share, you are an owner. You can show up to the shareholder meeting and vote if you want. Think that lemon grove is a dumb idea? You can vote on it! Sure, if you’re small lemons, you can’t influence anything. But larger investors definitely can. And you’ll benefit from their decisions the same as they do. If they sell the company for cash, you get your share of the cash. If they make their shares more valuable by making the company more valuable, your share gets more valuable too. 

Yes, sometimes valuations become detached from fundamentals. In those cases you have to be wary things could come back to earth. But stocks do have actual value and the more success a company has, the more value your shares will be."
6/14/2021 0:38,stocks,"I guess in my humble opinion, there comes a time when it doesn't make much sense to reinvest money into the company. Companies can only grow so much - there is a limit to company growth. The bigger a company gets, the more diminishing returns there are on reinvesting money. Can Amazon and Google really get that much bigger? Maybe but we'd all agree they are near their peak, right? I see that reinvesting money becomes a waste and when a company becomes huge they should shift their focus from growth to just maintaining their size/profits and providing income to investors. 

And I find it to be a fundamental negative that you're required to sell the company in order to profit from it. What if an investor wants to invest for life? If there are no dividends they can only sell the company in order to profit.

This is why I personally see that a stubborn refusal to ever give dividends takes away from the value of a company despite assets/earnings.

But I see your point of view and it also makes sense. It is how the market seems to think as well. The market doesn't care much about dividends."

In addition to all those ftds we also have a lot of puts—some major bearish bets on this tell me that we should be expecting a rise in interest rates soon. To me this falls in line with the fed’s efforts to curb inflation.

You need to understand the concept of market cap and p/e and peg. I don’t want to be mean, but you sound like a young, new and ignorant investor. Ofc Nvidia could perform better than AMD, nobody knows, but at least you should be open to counter opinions. And just the better hardware is not everything that counts for a stock.
