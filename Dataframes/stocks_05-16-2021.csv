2021-05-16 18:20:52,stocks,In many cases the shares are retired and shelved.
2021-05-16 18:20:14,stocks,This video explains it pretty simply in my opinion: https://youtu.be/rVTHRvNpsFs
2021-05-16 18:24:00,stocks,"A buyback reduces the number of outstanding shares.  All else remaining constant the value of the remaining shares would increase proportionately.  For an extremely simple example:
ABC Corp has 100 shares outstanding and is valued a $100 ($1 per share).  It buys back 50 of those shares.  The company is still worth $100 but now the outstanding shares are worth $2 each"
2021-05-16 18:36:59,stocks,"Buyback does nothing to the value of the company. 

But since there's fewer shares, it does increase the value of the stock. Buybacks are just more tax efficient dividends."
2021-05-16 19:19:28,stocks,"Looking at it from an earnings perspective, if a company makes $2.50 eps and has 100m shares outstanding, that‚Äôs $250m attributable earnings. Typically those attributable earnings will only drop a tiny fraction, likely the company‚Äôs opportunity cost of bank interest, for example say 0.5%.  If you take a company such as RKT for instance, it‚Äôs future earnings yield is approximately 15%.  When they buy back shares the earnings attributable to those shares bought back, now belongs to the remaining shares, so the remaining shareholders are making the net earnings yield, which bumps their EPS and value. In a sentence, the value of the company as a whole doesn‚Äôt change, but because there are fewer shares in issue, the value per share increases.  Obviously a company must weigh its opportunity cost against its earnings yield. If they can make 18% (would be fantastic), it would not make numbers sense to buy back if the overall earnings yield is 15%. But if their opportunity cost is interest on a bank account, they‚Äôd be derelict not buying back shares if their earnings yield is 15%."
2021-05-16 19:27:13,stocks,They can retire the shares or hold them as treasury stock. This reduces the # of outstanding shares and allows them to sell it again later.
2021-05-16 19:42:19,stocks,Hold
2021-05-16 19:06:15,stocks,My grower becomes a shower
2021-05-16 19:17:31,stocks,The number is also raised to the rafters.
2021-05-16 18:40:13,stocks,"The shares are worth what the market prices them at. So using AAPL as an example, they are worth a little over 2 trillion. If they buy back x amount of shares and the price of the stock does not go up then potentially their value might be worth less than 2 trillion? Am I missing something?

I watched the video from the other comment and the earnings per share will go up which *may* in turn cause the price of the shares to rise."
2021-05-16 18:42:39,stocks,"So basically, it‚Äôs like a ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to the investors?"
2021-05-16 19:18:59,stocks,Would AAPL ever do that? Aren‚Äôt they swimming in more money than they know what to do with ?
2021-05-16 18:41:29,stocks,"That's why I said ""all else remaining constant"""
2021-05-16 19:06:35,stocks,"Yes. Managements fiduciary duty is to the investor. 

If they don't have use for the cash then it makes sense to transfer that value to the investor."
2021-05-16 19:03:41,stocks,"Yep, and often times senior executives are the largest shareholders so it helps them as well as external shareholders"
2021-05-16 19:06:43,stocks,More like here's your money now leave me alone until next quarter/year
2021-05-16 19:27:21,stocks,"They *do* that, on a regular basis

https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2021/1/13/apple-won-the-share-buyback-debate"
2021-05-16 19:27:37,stocks,"If you are asking if AAPL would buy back shares, I am pretty sure that they announced at their last earnings that they will be buying back shares."
2021-05-16 19:29:47,stocks,"The info is a google away.

https://www.barrons.com/articles/tech-giants-have-ramped-up-stock-buybacks-apple-is-the-champ-51619780412"
2021-05-16 18:48:33,stocks,"I'm confused. A company is valued at outstanding shares * price per share, correct? So if a company buys back 1 million shares then if the price of stock stays at $100 then the value of the company is now $100million less, right?"
2021-05-16 19:12:21,stocks,"Makes sense. Personally, if I were a CEO I‚Äôd want to thank my investors with a buyback. But it would also be tempting to use the money to improve customer experience as well.

Pleasing investors and customers simultaneously seems like it would be hard! But if you can do both, that‚Äôs when a company grows I guess!"
2021-05-16 19:42:16,stocks,"Wait so could a CEO technically do an unreasonable buyback using company money, and then benefit personally because they own shares? And then they resign and let the new CEO deal with the shit show?"
2021-05-16 19:10:49,stocks,Hey I‚Äôll take it ;D
2021-05-16 19:02:05,stocks,"If all else remained constant the price of stock wouldn't stay the same.  If it does stay the same, then yes, the value (as measured by market cap) would decrease, but there would be some other cause for that, not the buy back."
2021-05-16 18:52:13,stocks,"No. Theoretically stock price doesn't stay the same.

Companies value isn't explicitly based on amt of shares."
2021-05-16 19:22:48,stocks,"For most companies,  buying a million shares is something that raises the price,  you've got to find more people willing to sell the shares and generally that means offering them a higher price.   Companies that do large buybacks spread them out over the quarter to try and avoid raising the price too much (they would prefer to buy low also) and try to reduce the share count.   A lower share count and constant earnings means a higher Earnings per Share number which they can advertise as ""growth""  and if the price doesn't go up, eventually it becomes a value stock."
2021-05-16 18:53:05,stocks,"Correct. It depends on whether the market valuation remains constant : if the market still thinks the company is worth X, but there are now less shares, then the share price has to increase.

But sometimes the market may say, ""this is a good time to reevaluate the valuation"""
2021-05-16 19:26:19,stocks,"At this point, the respondent has provided a great explanation. You decided to add more complexity and not necessarily in a logical way. I would recommend at this point doing a simple YouTube search. Plenty of video explain the entire mechanism."
2021-05-16 18:54:02,stocks,"No, market valuation comes first. Then it is applied to the number of shares outstanding. Share price is determined by market value, it‚Äôs not what *determines* market value.

Edit: What would happen in your $100M example is correct, but the mechanics of how you‚Äôre getting there are wrong."
2021-05-16 18:57:28,stocks,Why cant a stock just go up because of fundamentals improving. It sucks the GME thing made some feel everything is a short squeeze.
2021-05-16 19:06:55,stocks,short sqeeze deez nutz
2021-05-16 18:19:33,stocks,I think you think short squeeze means something other than what it actually means
2021-05-16 18:37:12,stocks,"""why it's due for a short squeeze"" and you are due for a downvote."
2021-05-16 18:32:00,stocks,I think reddit in general is confused by the phrase...
2021-05-16 18:30:52,stocks,I came to the same conclusion
2021-05-16 18:37:32,stocks,"Short squeeze is when stonk might go up, maybe."
2021-05-16 19:41:37,stocks,We used SumoLogic at my old job and when I left they were starting to transition away from it to something else. It was too expensive and didn't offer the same features as some of their competitors. I forget who they planned to go with.
2021-05-16 18:49:29,stocks,"I don‚Äôt know their product, but growth seems to be decelerating. On the last Quarter they only grew 22% compared with the same quarter last year. If you look at each quarter over 2020 the growth % is actually shrinking every single quarter. Idk if you deserve to trade at 9x sales growing at 20% and decelerating growth. I could be totally wrong and they are about to accelerate growth again, but I don‚Äôt have a reason why they would."
2021-05-16 19:42:21,stocks,Thanks for the reply.
2021-05-16 18:57:44,stocks,Interesting.  I guess I read the numbers wrong.  It seemed their revenue was increasing
2021-05-16 18:59:35,stocks,Ah.  I guess I was reading wrong.  Total revenue does seem to be decreasing.
2021-05-16 18:59:03,stocks,"Revenue is, but growth has been decelerating. Also dont they have competition with larger companies growing faster like splunk?"
2021-05-16 19:03:43,stocks,Yeah I mean sure they have competition.   I‚Äôm just trying to understand how they are tackling that.  I read an interview with their CRO but I had a hard time understanding about how they are working on that
2021-05-16 17:56:08,stocks,"If the valuation is right.  ""Buying tech"" is a blanket statement."
2021-05-16 19:59:31,stocks,"Better time than 3 weeks ago, but...the last 2 days is either a trend reversal or a bull trap.

Make large bets at your peril.

I put small money on the VIX and SQQQ, just in case. Upside on that is about 20x the downside potential."
2021-05-16 19:57:13,stocks,Good a time as ever I'd say
2021-05-16 19:10:27,stocks,certanly the best time to buy BABA
2021-05-16 19:41:27,stocks,Thats how its done. Buy the fear.
2021-05-16 18:19:22,stocks,"Are you investing for it to bounce quickly or plan to hold for a year or two. Catching the bottom is tough, this is a good time to buy some all things being considered. U is good, add Afrm to that list and ASAN."
2021-05-16 18:39:41,stocks,If TQQQ goes under $80 then I‚Äôd consider tech a buy. Don‚Äôt forget that tech has been the primary beneficiary of the pandemic.
2021-05-16 17:56:59,stocks,SQ imo has a lot of potential and has been corrected quite well over this past week.
2021-05-16 18:20:02,stocks,Any thoughts on SUMO logic?   Earnings coming up.  Good revenue growth.  50% off from their all time high.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021-05-16 19:49:51,stocks,"Even TQQQ right now would arguably be a buy. We're very close to march levels, you can get in now while others are fearful"
2021-05-16 18:00:58,stocks,I looked at their chart and they have fallen quite hard over the past few days. Do you think it will take a long time for them to get back up to above 250? They also have some Bitcoin which has fallen a lot the past week...
2021-05-16 19:29:18,stocks,"I'm a bagholder... Like the company, but so deep in the red that I might as well hold for now"
2021-05-16 18:16:50,stocks,"To be completely honest, my reason to invest in companies like SQ stems from a belief in their product and potential overall. I don‚Äôt think the rebound will be ‚Äúsuper quick‚Äù (like within a couple of months), but I believe they will continue to grow for their product is quite ubiquitous. 

With regards to their endeavors into crypto, I‚Äôm still uncertain how much potential there is (but so are most people). However, if it turns out crypto is the next big thing, you‚Äôre a winner. If not, then you still have a great company with established products and markets. I think the risk is just right for a moderately higher long-term payoff than say the s&p 500 etfs."
2021-05-16 19:37:46,stocks,Same.   Hello friend.  We got earnings coming up.   While I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to cause a moon mission.  I think it should bump it up a bit with a nice beat
2021-05-16 17:35:59,stocks,Malls are dying tho
2021-05-16 18:21:26,stocks,"Recently came out with a statement that online shopping is worse for the environment. Get real donkeys.

Don't get me wrong, I bought them at the bottom and will definitely dump them next year when all is relatively normal.

I think they're 80% recovered."
2021-05-16 17:45:22,stocks,[deleted]
2021-05-16 18:24:23,stocks,"This is true, but completely misguided. The bottom 60% or so of malls are dying, but the top 10% are doing as well, or better than ever. As the suburban malls close up, business is consolidating to the flagship malls on the heart of the city.

SPG does hold too many of the bottom half malls, but they have one of the best portfolios for the top end locations. There's still more than enough demand for brick and mortar retail for these places to do well.

Simon has also been one of the best companies for diversification away from malls. Outlets are on fire right now, and have been for several years as brands move away from discount retailers like TJ Maxx, and keep inventory, and margin, in house. SPG holds a number of outlet shopping centers that will do well.

Absolute worst case scenario, they hold prime real estate in the heart of the largest cities in America."
2021-05-16 17:45:42,stocks,"This. Simon Properties has very firmly tied the future success of its company to the future of shopping malls. I won't be hitching my wagon. 

My favorite reopening play is SABR - technology and AI wrapped up tightly in the travel industry. They just posted a disappointing quarter of earnings, coupled with a lack of future guidance due to pandemic uncertainties, but they have continued to expand their footprint and position themselves for growth beyond pre-pandemic levels once travel resumes full scale."
2021-05-16 17:45:39,stocks,The situation was no different from 1.5 years ago when this was at $229.  Only difference is the masses have a lot more buying power now.
2021-05-16 17:46:47,stocks,"In this environment it is extremely low.  Have you checked the PE of all the other re-open plays?  90% are at a net loss, aka negative PE"
2021-05-16 17:48:23,stocks,That buying power is going to Jeff Bezos
2021-05-16 16:30:49,stocks,To answer your question ‚Äúno‚Äù
2021-05-16 16:37:00,stocks,"Not much of an option for a small investor. As to large investors, I know one who purchased a 7th commercial building for rental purposes. That money undoubtedly came from stocks."
2021-05-16 19:45:03,stocks,"So, those two things are very different,  let's look at the first one,  Real Estate.   If you have a bunch of money in the stock market,  enough to buy a house,  maybe you consider selling your stock and buying a house,  but then your stuck.   Houses have a huge fee to buy or sell (realtor and other fees) plus you can only buy or sell the whole thing,  you can't just sell 10% of the house to get cash to buy a car, it's all or nothing.   Because of that it isn't tax efficient,  you have to sell a lot of stock to buy a house and get taxed on that,  then later selling the house if stocks look better you have to pay taxes on the entire amount of gains there too.  Lastly,  you can sell stocks rather quickly but buying or selling a house takes a least a month.   I don't think you'll see much money moving from stocks to houses as a trade based on houses rapid gains over a short time."

2021-05-16 18:07:04,stocks,"Tl;dr - they could be turning a corner at a convenient time in relation to inflation and commodity prices, but the lack of consistent profitability leaves much concern to vulnerability from macroeconomic issues as well as dilution, which happened last only six months ago.

Negatives: Their share price took off when pandemic-driven demand called for more hand sanitizer, but that was short-lived as supply outpaced demand ([page 26](https://ir.pacificethanol.com/sec-filings/content/0001213900-21-017995/0001213900-21-017995.pdf)). Their response to the share price spike in October was to dilute share holders by nearly 20% (approx [paragraph 11](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/19/pacific-ethanol-peix-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcr/), CEO remarks re: equity raising).

Positives: Its Pekin, IL facility sits on top of one of the most significant carbon capture resources in the United States (the [Mount Simon Sandstone formation](https://www.google.com/search?q=mount+simon+sandstone+formation&safe=active&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS904US904&sxsrf=ALeKk00gZvOVbExceFzK2wWSf32S0zqoSQ:1621200440133&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwidwd-iks_wAhXlTN8KHQL-DbgQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=1536&bih=722)), which is the at the center of the company's talks for a carbon capture and sequestration program. How much of a benefit this will be, as well as the timing of when it comes to fruition remain to be seen, which makes this particular asset intriguing, but highly speculative. Another plus is its most recent earnings posted a quarterly profit, thanks in large part to increasing commodity prices (for source: google the earnings transcript and read the first paragraph of the CFO's remarks). That gives it the potential of being a haven from inflation, should their profitability continue to grow with commodity prices.

The main asset they spun off was their ethanol production facility in Madera, CA. The total value of the deal is $28.3m, and by way of reduced interest expenses and carrying costs, this should result in approx $1.1m benefit per quarter to their overall business performance (ctrl+f for ""Seaboard Energy"" in the most recent earnings transcript). Sale is scheduled to complete this quarter. There are also capital expenditure projects which they expect to yield a relatively high ROI, but the overall scale of these projects is relatively small compared to its overall business operations."
2021-05-16 15:47:00,stocks,"Pro is that you use leverage and can increase your returns since you can buy more but it‚Äôs not all your money.

Con is that if things don‚Äôt go the way you think they will, you can get a margin call and either have to deposit more money into the account (which you may or may not be able to do at that time), and if you can‚Äôt they can sell some of yourself positions to raise the cash needed.

And just like it can magnify your gains, it can magnify your losses.

Part of the reason RH is offering it to you is because they‚Äôll charge you interest on any portion of the margin that you‚Äôre using and can make money from you that way.

For someone who is new to investing (and frankly for the vast majority of retail investors), it‚Äôs probably best to stay away from trading on margin."
2021-05-16 17:29:56,stocks,"Pro: make more money

Con: lose more money"
2021-05-16 17:39:20,stocks,Best advice I can give you is stay away from margin unless you are an experienced investor.
2021-05-16 17:21:03,stocks,I won‚Äôt even come close to touching a margin account. All money I‚Äôm willing to invest is money I‚Äôm willing to live without if I somehow lose it all. Using margin is just another way to leave yourself open to debt and having to invest more money than you were willing to invest initially if things go wrong
2021-05-16 16:33:07,stocks,Thank you everyone. I‚Äôm definitely going to research margin calls- which sound like a bad thing- and go real easy on the margin. They allowed me over 11k but I set a limit for myself for $500 so I don‚Äôt get carried away. Would be nice to make some money but I definitely can‚Äôt afford to be stupid about it so thank you all again for your wisdom!
2021-05-16 15:55:13,stocks,"When you trade on margin, the margin amount allows you to make larger trades. After the trade is over (you sell), the amount used to trade on margin is returned to the broker. You keep the profits.

Example: You're given 4x margin. You buy $1,000 of a $10 stock with your money, and use $3,000 of the broker's money, totalling $4,000 for the trade. Your stock price goes to $11, and you sell for $4,400. The margin amount of $3,000 goes back to the broker. Your profit for the trade is $400 instead of $100. 

Be warned: this works in reverse if you lose on a trade. Margin accounts let you get more leverage, but you can lose just as much in the negative, and thinking you won't lose is naive. Everyone loses, and the idea is to win 51% of the time.

Now, that I said that - stay far away from Robinhood."
2021-05-16 19:43:31,stocks,"Because it magnifies wins and losses, it is gambling and and not really investing."
2021-05-16 16:14:34,stocks,"Margin will magnify your wins or losses. This can be good or bad obviously. 

Brokers charge interest for margin loans, roughly 10% per year, so dont be buying with the intention to hold long term. Check your broker for exact %.

When ANY money hits your account from ANY source it is typically applied to pay down the margin loan first.

And, margin calls really suck. So learn how they come about and try to not put yourself in that position."
2021-05-16 16:56:50,stocks,"Use it to sell puts. The collateral is all margin but you don‚Äôt pay interest on it unless you get assigned. Only on stocks you want to own of course. And not financial advice. Duh

Also besides wanting to own the underlying pick something with a low delta to lower risk of assignment.

Finally learn how to roll puts and why/ when to roll puts."
2021-05-16 18:39:23,stocks,"Aside from win more loss more due to leverage with the fundamental margin discussion, buying with margin could be dangerous if it is all concentrated in one stock or underlying. Have more buying power could also be used to diversify, assuming the diversified portfolio is balanced to create an overall positive return. 

A lot of people just use margin for a handful of positions rather than consider money management of risking 5-10% per trade / position to lower risk and diversify the risk."
2021-05-16 18:42:23,stocks,"One of the ways people make money with stocks is by doing option trading. Usually, the capital to do safer plays is really high and some people use margin to lessen the capital needed to enter the that trade. I'm speaking about Covered Calls or synthetic covered calls. These can be pretty safe if you trade smartly and keep a mind your cost basis.

Remember tho, your risk tolerance is your own and I eat crayons for a living. Good luck!"

2021-05-16 15:41:38,stocks,Paper trade them for a while
2021-05-16 15:59:24,stocks,"Basically...

When you make a winning trade, you win big. 
  
When you make a losing trade, you lose big.  
  
Use margin on your forsure bets. Also, don't use margin on trades that take a long time to develop. Leverage is a powerful tool when used properly. You honestly can't get rich without it, so be smart with it."
2021-05-16 17:46:36,stocks,"Pros- Hella loot.
Cons- Financial ruin"
2021-05-16 16:57:58,stocks,Not any position. You can sell puts with margin as collateral. But no interest charge.
2021-05-16 16:28:43,stocks,Maybe next time do the example in the reverse scenario so they know how it usually works.
2021-05-16 17:05:16,stocks,"> Brokers charge interest for margin loans, roughly 10% per year

It's a lot better than 10 unless your account is tiny. It's about 5-7 for a typical 5 figure account and better with 6 figure. Some places go even lower."
2021-05-16 19:32:53,stocks,Ok I have no knowledge of puts but I will be learning about them now. Thanks for the advice
2021-05-16 17:05:06,stocks,This is interesting.
2021-05-16 16:30:29,stocks,Haha yup. You're definitely right.
2021-05-16 18:13:03,stocks,IBKR it's 1.5%
2021-05-16 15:33:04,stocks,"Kiyosaki doesn't give sound advice. By all means, finish the book, but it's not a great place to start. How serious do you want to get with investing? There are plenty of people doing just fine going 100% VOO and not putting any more thought into it. If you want to try your hand at things on your own, I'd recommend a book geared to towards actual investing Security Analysis by Graham is a solid start. Anything by Buffet would be acceptable as well. Then, learn how to read financial statements.

Good portfolios are all about risk management. Don't chase the memes pumped here constantly. Reducing volatility will give you better returns in the long run."
2021-05-16 17:32:21,stocks,"Sure, here is what I know.

1. In general, buy low and sell when you retire, or get insider knowledge and learn to avoid the SEC. 5% corrections happen four times a year, 5-10% corrections happen about once a year, and 10-20% corrections happen every 18months or so. The entire world will feel like it is falling apart and the end of capitalism is near; so don't sell, just smile and push all your chips in... unless you own small caps and meme stocks, in which case you deserve to panic sell and take your losses.
2. Your initial strategy should be buying sp500 large cap ETFs and whole market ETFs every month, and loading up on dips with your extra cash. This is most people's retirement strategy to be honest. As you get into it more and more, you might buy some calls or puts, or specific stocks you feel strongly about.
3. You will get a feel for how low is low enough once you watch a few dips. Many of the 3-5% corrections are just because the market over reacted and is cooling off, or Yellen said something about inflation. The 10-20% moves are usually coupled to fed rate hikes, over valuation fears, real inflation, or a couple quarters of less than desirable economic data and people start to fear a recession...or a combination of these factors. Most recessions don't get below -35%, so once we get close to these numbers all chips go in. 
4. Small caps usually do best coming out of recessions, so dump into small cap etfs once the selling slows, after six months of so of recovery, shift back to large caps and blue chips. Small caps also do worse during recessions, and worse after recoveries, so don't hold them for long. Look at the green energy bag holders on this sub (ICLN) - that should be enough proof. 
5. Tech grows fast, but is dependent on fed interest rates. If rates go up, tech panic sells off. More dip buying potential for nice rebound plays.
6. Dont fight the fed. Once the fed starts quantitative easing, the market goes up, so be invested. Once the printing stops, overvaluation and inflation fears correct the market, so be ready for a 10-20% move down. ""Be ready"" means move all your extra cash into the account, pick your stocks and ETFs, and be ready for the move up or down. ""Extra cash"" means everything other than money needed for your car payment, rent, and ramen - dump the girlfriend or boyfriend. 
7. ETFs are easiest unless you have intimate knowledge AND like to invest as a hobby. This doesn't mean only buy VOO, you can buy etfs for specific industries, but you will need to pay closer attention to the markets and move cash around as necessary.
8. Dividend stocks suck. Dividends get smaller and smaller as the years go on. Dont do it.
9. By the time you hear about ""it"" on CNBC, FOX, or CNN it is too late, don't jump on the band wagon. 
10. I had something about a rabbit and a turtle, and wise words to encourage mediocrity that somehow amounts to excellence over time, but clearly that is so stupid I forgot. Get as much money into the market as you can on dips when you are young. Full-on 100% everything in. The proof is in a compounding interest calculator, I recommend you play with one. Or look at the share price of MSFT and AAPL at the peak of 08, then the bottom of the recession, compared to now. Every month you set aside as much money as you possible can for investing, no matter what.
11. Only date people who have both a 401k and a roth IRA. Employers often pay for one account so someone might sound financially responsible because ""they have a retirement account"", but they are actually fuck-wits and posers who will expect fancy diners and ruin you financially. If they ever order avocado toast, exit immediately. This goes for friends and family as well as dates. Live frugally.
12. Money does not give you purpose. Money will not help you ""find purpose"". Purpose is something you create through hard work and dedication to something greater than yourself, and when the time comes having money will be really nice. If someone tells you ""what is the point of having money if you don't spend it?"", like the avocado toast scenario, ghost them and run away. These people will suck your account dry ""getting drinks"", or ""going out for coffee"", or ""why not get a nicer apartment, you deserve it""... blah blah blah - POISON! Live frugally. 
13. Start with a ROTH IRA. You can withdraw from this for home purchases, so it doubles as a tax advantaged investment account as well as a way to save for a home. Being a home owner will improve the quality of your mating options too. Once you clear 6k a year in contributions (max out the IRA), open a 401k next and dump everything extra you have into that. Once you max out your roth and the 401k, then get a brokerage account and keep going.
14. Use a real broker like Schwab, TD Ameritrade, or Fidelity. Stay away from the millennial and gen Z crap apps like Robinhood. 

Thats about it for now."

2021-05-16 17:45:40,stocks,Rule (1) reduce high interest debt. (2) while you learn to buy index funds. These are long term. Pay attention to the fund management fee. vanguard 50 through fidelity and others has a super low fee and it chases the S&P 500.
2021-05-16 16:44:12,stocks,"I‚Äôm a 22 year old too who started investing in October, I only had 1k to invest at first so I chose to make riskier investments such as penny stocks but in the 3-7 $ range cause those companies usually have more news and information I could rely on. Trading lower valued stocks worked really well for me i wasn‚Äôt worried about losing my Initial investment and was more looking for gains that could really impact me at this age instead of putting a couple thousand in and being satisfied with 10-20% a year so by retirement I‚Äôd be well of. i was up 2200% in the first 4 months so my strategy was working really well but it does require the ability to handle stress cause if I saw a stock that was in my eyes a diamond in the rough I‚Äôd go all in which can cause a lot of anxiety. Recently though I‚Äôve changed my strategy and have taken a safer route to investing cause of the unstable state the market is in right now. I‚Äôd suggest waiting to actually invest for a couple months and take this time learning and maybe practice by paper trading to get a better idea cause with how the market is looking if you went in right now you might find yourself very disappointed and turned away from the stock market"
2021-05-16 15:37:29,stocks,"From what I understand, when you‚Äôre in your twenties, it‚Äôs okay to make risky investments that are frowned upon later on in life. That‚Äôs why I like penny stocks. Really depends on your risk tolerance. There‚Äôs definitely high risk high reward stocks out there. This isn‚Äôt financial advice, just what I‚Äôve heard. 

Most older people do low risk low reward stocks that grow extremely slowly over time."
2021-05-16 19:11:05,stocks,Agreed with everything except the last sentence. Risk and volatility are completely different. If you diversify less you will have greater volatility but are more likely to deviate from the average
2021-05-16 15:39:09,stocks,"Thanks for the reply & advice! Given I‚Äôm young && have no debt, I want to just build a decent base (less than $10k in investments) before I start working. I‚Äôm not too familiar with some of the terminology you used (VOO, volatility), but I love to read so I will check out the books you recommended :))"
2021-05-16 16:09:46,stocks,"Agree. I opened a Roth for my son this year because he had reported income. VTI. Long term.  

I don‚Äôt think you get a 401k i grad school but you‚Äôll likely get income from research. You can put away $6k/yr in a Roth IRA. Open that baby up and fund it with VTI. Other suggestions on here are great in the 3-4 year span because who knows how things will evolve‚ÄîApple (has dividends), Amazon, Visa, etc. 

When you start working, max out your 401k because it‚Äôll lower your tax rate (but earnings will be taxed, unlike Roth IRA). I tell my new hires to max out on their Roth IRA first, then 401k (since salary and tax rate still manageable) because eventually, they will make too much to qualify for Roth."
2021-05-16 15:41:21,stocks,"Ah ok, I feel like I can wait over the course of 2 years for my stocks to make actual profit so I don‚Äôt mind a slower rising stock, but do want a return eventually!"
2021-05-16 15:50:49,stocks,Penny stocks return -30% per year on average.

2021-05-16 16:00:31,stocks,"Yeah cause the average penny stock is shit. You have to sort through the hay to find the needle. Hence why it‚Äôs called high-risk high-reward.

You go from 5 cents to 10 and you‚Äôve doubled your money. 

Tell me how many NASDAQ stocks will double your money in less than a year when the average return is 10%?"
2021-05-16 16:13:08,stocks,"Lottery stocks don‚Äôt tend to reward higher risk; they give even less reward the more risk there is as their prices are bid up by excited gamblers. High risk-low reward. I‚Äôd be impressed if your investing ability was *consistently* higher than the average.

‚ÄúLottery stocks....have negative expected returns....have an extremely small probability of a very high reward‚Äù

Also, I would not expect 10% returns in the NASDAQ from here on."
2021-05-16 16:54:01,stocks,In my experience I wouldn‚Äôt go as far to call all penny stocks lottery stocks. If you come across the right stock and do your research on it no matter what the price of it is you can have a pretty safe idea of where it will go in the future just usually atleast the way I look at penny stocks they are more of a short term investment where you‚Äôre waiting for the stock to go from $2 to $5 in a few months then pulling out. Not waiting for it to slowly grow year over year. In other terms im content with multiple base hits to bring in the run instead of a home run doing it all at once

2021-05-16 18:40:13,stocks,"Not sure about others but here are mine:

* They have a forward P/E of about 13 which makes them attractively valued. 
* They have a decent dividend of 4.53% and free cash flow. They are paying down their debts slowly. 
* The new CEO is focused on growth and not on EPS unlike the last two CEOs. I really like the Red Hat acquisition and that the Red Hat folks are staying around. 
* Hybrid cloud seems like a good strategy for their existing customers where security is a key concern."

2021-05-16 18:57:13,stocks,"Anyone who has worked at or worked with IBM in the last decade+ can tell you that your money is better invested somewhere else. The only hope for IBM is that the entire C-Suite & board are replaced. Give the RedHat leadership team the reins because they actually know how to make a profit. 

The last decade and more have been a huge growth period for technology companies yet IBM has went nowhere; this is especially bad due to the sheer amount of resources IBM has/had at their disposal that they could have used to make a switch in strategy.

If they had spent half as much on technical engineering rather than financial engineering they might be in a much better place."

2021-05-16 16:36:02,stocks,"They're one of the few technology companies that's cheap/value at current prices.

When they spin off their legacy IT business, I'll probably invest in that because I suspect a lot of investors will be selling it off for cheap.

What a lot of people don't realize is how many businesses are built off of legacy software that is difficult to move off of. It's a cash flow machine much like the cloud, just without the growth. At the right price, it can be a great investment.

The thing about stock prices as a ""return"" is a lot of it just expectations. A stock can go up 4x without growing earnings or book value just because investors are willing to pay more for the same company. If that expectation subsides, so can your return."

Big Blue ain't so big anymore."
2021-05-16 17:03:44,stocks,"One thing that made me invest in them is their symbolic AI. Look it up if you are curious. It brings the performance of big AI models like GPT-3 and combines it with understandable AI responses and decisions which big systems lack now. 
As a bonus their hybrid cloud although started slow it's getting traction. 
And cute prospect: they are leaders in quantum computing and could come with something really cool in that field.

I agree they felt a lot but in the last year it was mainly restructuring and that's the some in this year. But for me the symbolic AI convinced me to invest."
2021-05-16 19:44:43,stocks,Many reasons.  They have a mountain of patents that make all that money that pays for that fat dividend.  They are working on a lot of new ideas as well; the quantum super computer/quantum computing in general was the most interesting to me.

He‚Äôs now VP of their technology department and hasn‚Äôt looked back at IBM, except to sell off his considerable stock holding years ago. Said leaving IBM was the best decision he made."
2021-05-16 19:43:37,stocks,IBM sucks as a company. They're not even sure what their core competencies are. Consulting? Manufacturing? Patent filings? Watson? Too many irons in the fire. They're like the GM of the business/tech world.
2021-05-16 19:10:47,stocks,Perfect time to evaluate and do your DD.  Turnaround always have a higher payout in the long run than simply following the trend.
2021-05-16 16:46:10,stocks,"IBM is a beast. They own more patents than anyone. It‚Äôs cheap in price for a tech company in blockchain, AI, and cloud. They are not a leader in any of the industries they are in, but they have the potential for sudden exponential growth in those areas. They also generate a lot of cash. I‚Äôm invested.

2021-05-16 16:21:32,stocks,Your seeing clearly. I know it sounds crazy but people will invest because of a dividend without even considering what happens to capital. Its moronic. Sometimes companies can make a come back but obviously there would have to be some sort of argument and company change that makes sense about them making money in the future. But for now its a sinking ship with a nice dividend.

We likely wont hear any news of it for years, except maybe some analyst asking during an earning call, but with it being so far out, IBM, Intel, Samsung, wouldnt be able to give specifics and would just say they were in discussion of it.

TSMC isnt partnered with IBM, and they should have their own 3nm node already in the pipeline by now, so definitely not them.

They're the highest earning hedge fund by a longshot, and it's all due to their utilization of TA. In this article it states that their strategy is entirely based around what the quantitative models tell them to do, and they essentially toss fundamentals aside. Of course, we don't have access to their technology so it is an unfair comparison, but to ignore the value that TA has is just absurd. It has been proven to be a great tool, and the fact that some people still deny this is insane to me

Here's the portion of the article I was referring to.

How Did the Medallion Fund Make Money?

What‚Äôs even more intriguing about the Medallion Fund‚Äôs historic run is that the people who produced it knew next to nothing about business and individual companies.¬†
As¬†Greg Zuckerman highlighted, when co-CEO Robert Mercer was asked how the firm made so much money with its models he responded:

Sometimes it tells us to buy Chrysler, sometimes it tells us to sell.

Unbeknownst to Mercer, Chrysler had been acquired by Daimler AG in years prior and no longer existed as a stock!¬†
This funny anecdote illustrates just how reliant the Medallion Fund was on its quantitative models as opposed to underlying business fundamentals.¬†¬†As Zuckerman noted:

Early on, Simons made a decision to dig through mountains of data, employ advanced mathematics, and develop cutting-edge computer models, while others were still relying on intuition, instinct, and old-fashioned research for their predictions.¬† Simons inspired a revolution that has since swept the investing world.¬†¬†

So, how does the Medallion Fund make money?¬† It finds individual patterns in data and exploits each pattern just enough to turn a small profit.¬† And when you add up all of those small profits, you end up making¬†a lot¬†of money.¬† ¬† ¬†

2021-05-16 18:02:55,stocks,"I‚Äôm not familiar with carbon credit ETF‚Äôs, but do have small experience procuring and trading the underlying credits for resale to customers, as well as financing for carbon offset projects.

I‚Äôll write my thoughts on a bull and bear case:

Bull: As demand for carbon credits rise, prices of said credits will rise. Due to both organic demand growth from companies looking to offset emissions, as well as regulatory pressure in advanced economies, the raw volume of carbon credits traded should increase. Since the ‚Äúcheap‚Äù carbon offset programs have already been implemented, these new projects will be higher cost, requiring the market price of a carbon offset certificate to rise.  This bull case is relatively simple. More demand + no easy way to offset carbon = higher prices.

Bear:
1. Carbon capture technology and other emission offset tech becomes more efficient and carbon credits decrease in value as these credits become cheaper to generate. 

2. Since the definition of what qualifies as a carbon offset is entirely theoretical, there are ample opportunities for fraud and questionable business transactions. Depending on the regulatory body certifying these credits, some projects are certified without proper due diligence. This makes the cost curves of these credits murky at best, and difficult to project future pricing.

3. As you said in your post, carbon credits are mostly created, regulated, and sold in western markets. This is in part due to the only regulators willing and able to sign off on the validity of carbon credits being located in western countries, but also because that is where the only market for the credits exists. In a way, carbon credits are a luxury item, not a need to have. Once the price rises high enough, countries such as Vietnam will begin to invest and sell carbon credits at VERY low prices. Imagine China reforesting an area and selling the associated carbon capture. I‚Äôm sure they can do it cheaper than how we are currently operating...

As far as your tinfoil explanation, I personally feel there is such low transaction volume and liquidity that the major news outlets don‚Äôt follow carbon credit indexes and pricing. 

I also think that carbon credits are a relatively safe investment for now. I have never seen so much interest in procurement of carbon neutral products and credits before. I think in the next 5-10 years there will be a significant increase in demand where the price of an underlying tonne of CO2 will at least double.  Once that happens I would be ready to jettison out as there may be a rapid fall."

I‚Äôm studying sustainable business and one of my professors believes carbon taxes and cap-and-trade are inevitable to become widespread in the US relatively soon. I‚Äôm probably going to end up buying into one or both of these. I‚Äôd also like to hear from others because again, I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm doing and learning as I go. Perhaps 10 years down the road, these won‚Äôt be great investments depending on how much carbon we‚Äôre still using (this is a very optimistic approximation but it‚Äôll probably take longer than that unless some big changes happen very soon on a global scale). That would be a good consequence though. Maybe they aren‚Äôt talked about on major news networks not because of a lack of volatility, but because enough people aren‚Äôt on board yet.

Or, if your adjusted gross income (Form 1040, line 8b) on your tax return was over $150,000 ($75,000 if you're married and file separately), do you expect that your income tax withholding will be at least 110 percent of the total tax you owed for the previous year? If so, then you're not required to make estimated tax payments."

Originally they predicted Time Warner and NBC should merge, but either way this is a win win for $T holders. They GREATLY reduce their debt (which has held down the stock for years) allowing them to save an ass-ton on interest payments while creating a powerhouse streaming service that takes arguably THE best TV series (Game of Thrones, Sopranos, etc...) and combines it with the most watched reality TV series in the country and puts it under one roof. $T would obviously own the majority of the stake which only bodes well for $T's future. This combination is also well timed as $T just had a blowout quarter and will be happening before they start releasing their blockbuster movies this fall that were postponed during the pandemic (which of course stream on HBO Max). The advertising they could now take in will also crush numbers."

2021-05-16 14:33:17,stocks,I don't get this from AT&T's perspective.  Warner Media is such a bigger fish than Discovery.  Merging implies (although does not mean) that they are somewhat equal.  AT&T should just buy Discovery if they want their content.

It's happening frequently when a company wants to ditch some division or some business and they create a new entity which is merged with a bigger fish. In this case I see Discovery as being ducked in the new economy so they want to jump on the same bandwagon as HBO Max yet T doesn't need then enough so they put down a few billions for it. T will still own tons of the New Corp shares so they don't lose anything, even win if the new company is seen as a growth one decoupled from the debt of T."
2021-05-16 17:08:40,stocks,Merging two different audiences under one roof. Discover+ is all about reality TV. HBO Max & Time Warner are TV series and movies. The combined entity would also GREATLY increase ad revenue and synergies by bundling everything.

Verizon sold Yahoo just when it was showing progress, to focus on its core business so that T-Mobile doesn‚Äôt leave them in the dust. AT&T could be doing the same thing, in which case this could be the first step in spinning off HBO/WB as well. Or, they could see HBO Max as their big growth engine, in which case this is a decision to focus more resources on that. CNN, TNT etc don‚Äôt offer that much to people who are coming to HBO Max for movies and original TV series. News, documentaries and reality shows are really a different audience."

Say you have one stock making 50% returns a year

Say you have 5 stocks each making 50% a year

*(1) 5x2000 (2) 5x3000 (3) 5x4500 (4) 5x6750*

***ie you will make the same amount***

They can actually make that 50% in any which way too, as long as it averages.

The benefit to having more diversity means at least you mellow some of the volatility of holding fewer stocks. Yes, Stock A might rocket 500% in a year, but you didn't know that, it equally could have crashed (eg Tesla which was reported to be days away from bankruptcy at points a couple years ago). You say you want slow and steady growth, so less of a YOLO portfolio seems very reasonable. Which is what you have here (although i disagree with some of the choices, but that's a personal thing)."

For your folks - if you are looking for a more passive management (something that you are not going to dick around with week-in, week-out - do indexed mutual funds and set it and forget it. Look at the asset mix that best suits their tolerance for risk (much of this has to do with age), and at least with Vanguard - they have the Admiral Funds which mirror their investor class but with less management fees if they have enough initial capital.

Seem familiar?

Bread is one of the worst things in the world, but we‚Äôve always needed it. Until now!

By burning three diff types of meat together, the Tracy Jordan Meat machine takes bread out of the equation!

Now your sandwich is all of the good stuff! That‚Äôs delicious. 

Doctor: ‚ÄúAnd its healthy. Hi, I‚Äôm Dr. Leo Spaceman. I‚Äôm a working physician with a degree from the Ho Chi Min school of medicine.‚Äù

Dr. Spaceman, is it true that bread eats away at your brain?‚Äù

Doctor: ‚ÄúWe have no way of knowing because the powerful bread lobby keeps stopping my research!‚Äù

Well folks, bread will never maybe attack your brain again. Because with the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine, say it with me now:

&#x200B;

**MEAT IS THE NEW BREAD!**

\[Look up 30 Rock- Tracy Jordan Meat Machine if want to watch this, much better than words can describe\]

&#x200B;

**FEYE**\- FireEye, I have some of this as the company is highly regarded by cyber security professionals. Often where they go when they need help! Saw them in the headlines this week due to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware. 

&#x200B;

Speaking of Colonial, they just paid the ransomware ransom of 5 million dollars to the group DarkSide who now apparently plans to disband and apologized for all the gasoline worries! How kind.

&#x200B;

**BMW** seems to be decent luxury car maker pure play. 46% owned by two brothers so no risk of takeover, rejecting all the bells and whistles of advertising in favor of simply making a good product and selling it. China sales doubled \[while TSLA sales down in China\]. p/e under 20 for the German ticker. Need to look at the ADR to see how many German shares it represents 

&#x200B;

**Rblx**\- loss of 0.46 per share \[0.25 miss\]; revenue was up 147% YoY\[miss\] and bookings were higher. Daily active users also increased 79% YoY up to 42.1 million. Rblx appears up on the earnings and calls outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with May 14th 70 call being most actively traded contract as of Tuesday \[source schwab options report\]- I have a handful of shares as tons and tons of daily users.

&#x200B;

Out of China, seeing **speculation** that China‚Äôs Crypto is going to be **gold** backed which should be interesting in terms of gold supply and demand. I have a couple shares of some random gold miner and maybe a gold etf I dont know. But yeah. Very interesting and potentially paradigm shift. I could not confirm that it would be gold backed through any article that appeared completely neutral. They would likely try to divest their holdings of US Debt/US Currency prior to formally announcing this as it would cause shocks across the FOREX markets I would think and devalue USD and possibly others.

 Market week ran an article on how much Gold China owns, very interesting read. I am and have been bullish on China, I own baba, tencent and many other Chinese tech companies. I think absent some world war or full blow Cold War that China will be the next global super power for good or ill so take that as you will. I also am long the yuan for this reason despite not necessarily supporting China in a social/moral sense.\[lets go back to only doing camps for fun instead of for whole portions of populations for no other reason then ethnic/religious backgrounds!\]

&#x200B;

I am still long on the stay at home thesis, yes there is pent up demand to go out and shop/eat/travel, but after this experience I think people may invest more into their home just so they are not caught off guard if this were to happen again in the future. Combine that with the increased work from home workforce and I think the stay at home stocks will be just fine in the long run.  The sell off in tech is an entry point if you don‚Äôt believe that the whole system will ultimately collapse and you have the ability to wait out the downturn.  The only way to time the absolute bottom is blind luck so just buy companies you like at valuations that don‚Äôt offend you and I believe you will be fine over the long term.

&#x200B;

We are now showing **Fear** on CNN fear and greed index.  A year ago it was more fearful, but some great returns were built in those times, so perhaps the recent pullbacks over inflation concerns are overblown.  If you believe in the continued recovery of the world economy then I think definitely time to start being a little bit greedy.  As Buffett and others have said- be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

&#x200B;

Times like these are where the greatest returns can be born.

&#x200B;

**VMW**\- new CEO techno centric- VMWare. Been with company since 2003 when was still a startup and now 12 billion business. He‚Äôs been leading push into selling software that lets companies run their internal and external apps in multiple cloud computing services and in house data centers. NO requirement for employees to return to physical offices full time which seems like Ag old move as some other companies that said would promote people who came back into office over those WFH faced a walkout. The need for options is essential in keeping high value employees without making them feel ostracized for making decisions that are best for themselves and there family. Currently trading in the 156 range yahoo consensus is  170.79; 32 p/e. 4.86 EPS.  Earnings report 5/27/2021, I may try and pick up a couple shares before earnings or see what other options are for long term investment this seems like one to me. I like operators at the head of company over salesman, they can lay the foundation for them to remain relevant and hire other people to toot their horn.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sanctuary, an astrology startup that also sells psychic readings to users for no low price. U.S. laws around psychic readings are patchwork at best, with CEO and founder Ross Clark arguing the app is offering entertainment rather than fortune-telling‚Äîexempting it from the more onerous of state laws. The readings, Clark says, is a practice in empathy rather than actually peering into the crystal ball. But still, the question remains, is funding the practice ethical? 

Some investors think otherwise. Lux Capital‚Äôs Josh Wolfe on Twitter did not mince his words upon hearing news of the startup‚Äôs seed funding: ‚ÄúSeriously shame on anyone funding or encouraging this bullsh\*t. No doubt there is demand, but this isn‚Äôt peddling entertainment, it‚Äôs encouraging slippery slope snake oil flapdoodle.‚Äù Here too is Vinod Khosla at Khosla Ventures in response to Wolfe‚Äôs tweet: ‚ÄúAgree. There is also demand for heroin, fat, sugar‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd be ashamed to fund such a venture.‚Äù 

Proponents argue that astrology and psychic readings play a similar role as religion or therapy, while its detractors argue the practice is rooted in pseudoscience. 

 

Disrupters on the dip, possible entry points if like the companies:

&#x200B;

**TSLA**\- recently big dip.  They do have decent advantage in EV market having good tech but there is tons and tons of money being burned by competitors to catch up and overtake. Currently \~36% down from its 52 week highs.

&#x200B;

**ETSY**\- 37% off its 52 week highs. Still vulnerable because growth stock and these will be the first sacrificed in any major downturn. But it is rapidly growing and it is the only one focused solely on creative goods made by artists/entrepreneurs. Gross merchandise sales \[3.1 billion\] 132.3% YOY increase in Q1, net income \[143.8 billion\] up 1048.1% YOY. Yahoo price target consensus at 226.13. Did turn a profit. 3.52 EPS, 46.32 P/E. 20.73 Billion market cap. I own some and have been happy. Seems like they use debt sparingly and have a good cash flow. So probably would sell off in major downturn but doubt would be in danger of bankruptcy or not being able to weather a storm.

&#x200B;

**LOVE**\-Lovesac- American furniture retailer. I‚Äôm not sold here but they do modular furniture and apparently doing pretty well. 4 years of double digit net sales growth, expanded digital channels during pandemic, makes products from recycled plastic bottles and furniture built to last lifetime so that is appealing. Yahoo price target consensus for one year at 74.50 which is lower then the \~75 its at now. EPS .96, P/E 79.07. Would think about it if pulled back but not at current price myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some REITS to consider: 

&#x200B;

**FRT**\- Federal Realty Investment trust, focusing on shopping centers, street retail, mixed use. Major markets in LA, DC< NY, Silicon Valley. Many tenants like grocery stores, restaurants, fitness centers, service based business. 3.8% dividend.  I would be worried about the markets they are in as there is a recent exodus from cities like this in favor of the new tech centers such as Austin and Miami. 

&#x200B;

**IIPR**\- Innovative Industrial Properties- this one has been on my radar for a year +, I got in fairly early and sold last march to reap the profits as thought downturn was going to be longer lasting.  I am back in a couple shares and happy. It specializes in medical cannabis growers. So they just set up the warehouses and have triple net leases IIRC so they have virtually no ongoing costs and just reap rent profits. Cannabis use seems to be up big in the pandemic so may be a lasting trend and with it becoming legal in more and more states I think this is a long term smart play.  3.16% dividend on the normal shares and does sell preferred shares with larger dividend as well. Only have one share in the normal, down 3.76% on stock price I bought at and \~4 shares in the IIPR/PRA 9% preferred dividend I am up \~14%. No plans to sell either.

&#x200B;

**STAG**\- stag industrial, inc. invests in warehouses across country, \~40% of portfolio is leased to e-commerce tenants. Biggest tenant is AMZN, but AMZN constantly looking to cut out middle men and achieve vertical monopolies in every field they operate it seems.  The good thing for STAG is that IIRC, this came up on my radar a while back and many of their properties are located in key areas around international airports and there is only so much warehouse space available that is located in key spots like this, so while AMZN can very well replace them in areas that have space, this may not be possible for reasonable costs in metropolitan areas, especially around airport hubs. I do have a couple shares in here and am up \~20% with no plans of selling at this time.

&#x200B;

Will be interesting to see how we do as Mask Mandates are ending across the country as we approach the 4th of July and summer traveling season.  Will enough of America be vaccinated/have natural immunity due to infection to prevent another spike? Will the world get it together before we create and spread a variant that does not respond to vaccines? Time will tell, and possibly present some fire sales if the panic and fear sets in again a la March 2020.

&#x200B;

**CriCut**\- MarketBeat presented this as a very interesting company but my subsequent \[quick research\] did not back that up. Allegedly company that helps people design and build any idea they might have. Growth at triple digit rate. Not profitable. Added 600k new users last quarter. Paid subscriptions up 140% to 1.6 million paid subscriptions. Yahoo price consensus around 27 with 5 analysts weighing in from a low of 23 to a high of 35. Currently \~24-25. Something I will look into...searching online just brings up a bunch of fancy label makers though a nod on website not seeing this design and build any idea so not sure what this article is talking about. If anyone sees something I missed let me know because from article looked very interesting. Not so much after looking at website and reading the wiki.

You sound very responsible and tbh, a little bit like me when I was your age. The biggest advice I can offer is not in how to diversify but in encouraging you to also set some time/budget aside for you to just have fun. Life is short. Responsibilities come fast. As you get older, you‚Äôll have more money and make more money. You may look back and wish you had invested a little of that money/discipline while you were 19 into just having fun!

3. No one ever lost money taking a little profit. 

4. You are very young, so no issue w/ being aggressive in stock allocation. 

5. The more you check your stocks on average, the worse you do. 

6. Most people don‚Äôt beat the market, so if u allocate 80% to an index, you can still have 20% at your discretion and have fun while guaranteeing at least a market return."
2021-05-16 11:15:40,stocks,"Investments aside (you have time horizon so I believe you‚Äôll do fine in the long run), I wouldn‚Äôt consider saving every single penny and sacrificing your social life to save necessarily a good thing. It varies from person to person of course, but that is what I did, I hardly went out to socialize in university. I went out maybe once a month or sometimes every other month. I had a solid group of friends already (still are) and we can go months without talking to each other only to meet up and like no time has past between us. 

Even though I know I came out ahead being able to pay off my student loans and saving consistently, I lost a lot in terms of the social aspects of uni life and early 20s. My friends met their long term gf‚Äôs in uni, travelled the world, made a ton of new connections, while I was at home saving money and gaming to pass time. I had a lot of relationships and most of them were short term since I met most of them through dating apps. 

There is a fine medium between saving for your future and enjoying your life in the present. It‚Äôs something I came to terms with not long ago. I finally realized this in my mid 20s, I think it was a good lesson to learn even this early because honestly, anything can happen and you might spend your entire 20s saving just to die in a freak accident the next day. I‚Äôm not saying to go spend like it‚Äôs your last day, don‚Äôt be on either extremes because you just might end up with regrets. This was more of a personal finance post, but just my two cents."

Tesla has a sky high p/e -- yes, they should grow into it over time but if the p/e is going to fall from 600x (TTM basis) to 60x (still very high) than earnings have to grow by 50x to make it a 5 bagger...

2021-05-16 17:31:58,stocks,"My advice- keep everything you have. 

If you continually invest more, 100$/month, or 10$/month, decide what you want to build up on a moving forward basis. 

Your goal is Not to make a quick buck on one stock, flip it over to the next quick buck on a better stock, flip it over again to another stock. 

Your goal is 20+ years away and 20+ years of Growth. 

I‚Äôd look into dividend payers, in particular Real estate investment trusts like O and GOOD and GAIN.  Those three averaged around a 4-6% Dividend every year. You invest 100$, they give you 4$ back every year. If you hold that for 25 years, they‚Äôve given you your money back And you‚Äôve still got the investment. The REITs are contractually obligated to send profits back to shareholders. They‚Äôre basically ‚Äúregular stocks‚Äù in how You buy/sell through a normal broker, but this is literally you buying a piece in real estate with 100% monetary effort and zero physical effort. (As opposed to renting out your second home and having to pay the taxes, general upkeep, fix the broken stove etc etc). The entire market took a nose dive in this sector last year, and people are Still hesitant to move back to the big cities so these REITs are Still down pretty low.

Take an excel sheet, project how much you can save from each paycheck with 2-4% annual growth. This will give you a brief idea how much you might have in 10-20-30 years.  


Then play with amounts, try increasing amount every 5 years, since your income most probably will grow with your experience.  


After all this will be a good experience of planning your future, this is when you can see how much will your bigmac grow and decide whether you want to have today, or in 30 years with extra fries, since due to inflation the prices would also grow :)

This way, you ensure to spend a share of pay you are willing to invest in stocks, and the money thats left is fair play to spend on whatever you like. I feel like this strategy can both help you with consitant investing each month, as well as reducing the guilt one might feel when buying things like Mcdonalds as you say. This way will also mitigate risk over time, since you'll be buying both the lows and highs."

2021-05-16 14:08:44,stocks,"So first off: good job saving! In the long run, continuing to contribute to your portfolio is going to matter more than what you invest in.

That said, I think 75% in individual stocks - in ANY individual stocks! - is taking a huge amount of risk for little guaranteed return. It‚Äôs **absolutely appropriate** for a 19-year old to take more risk than someone near retirement, but you want to be **compensated** for that risk.

Consider [this portfolio](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=1&annualAdjustment=10000&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=true&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=IVV&allocation1_1=100) which involved contributing $10k / year (not adjusted for inflation) and just yeeting it all into IVV, the S&P 500.  The returns between 2000-2021 were fantastic, and someone with this portfolio made huge amounts of money while taking much less risk than anyone invested in individual stocks.

I‚Äôm not saying ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt invest in individual stocks‚Äù, but you should **have a plan that limits your exposure**. The thought experiment is this: Assume you are the worst stock-picker in the world. Assume every individual pick you make is gonna go to zero. How much of your portfolio will you be OK with losing? If that amount is less than 75%, then **limit your individual stock picks to that percentage**. Put the rest in a broad-based market index, like VTI. Profit.

You should also plan to revisit your investment plan every few years. Let‚Äôs say (I‚Äôm making up a number) that as a 19 year old, you‚Äôre ok losing 50% of your portfolio on individual stock picks, on the off chance one of them hits pay dirt.  When you‚Äôre 25, it‚Äôs possible that your tolerance for losing on your individual picks may have dropped; adjust the percentage of your portfolio in any individual stock accordingly."

2. Be as aggressive as possible while you‚Äôre young. Before you turn 30 have as high of a tolerance for risk as you can, invest in stuff that you think has a chance of really growing some generational wealth, and take jobs with potential for lots of advancement not a stable career. Worst case it doesn‚Äôt work out and when you‚Äôre 30 you get a stable career and make risk averse investments and are still fine.
Best of luck with everything, but remember your investments should be to make your quality of life better, not worse. Spend some money on beer, go to the movies and enjoy college. You only get to do it once."

The last thing you want to be doing is selling at the bottom of a big drawdown or bear market because you need to eat, thats the time where you want to be pouring new money into the market. The price of outperformance is volatility. I wouldn't look at my portfolio as a retirement plan, but just as part of the plan.

2021-05-16 17:01:37,stocks,"I am responding from a Canadian perspective so think about that first if it applies to you... My retirement goal is $3-4k in regenerating money per month through dividends, which means I never touch the principle. I invest heavily in stocks that pay me **monthly dividends/distributions,** this is key because anything that pays like quarterly will not give me the same DRIP return as monthly does.  

I will need between $400 and $500k to make this happen and will be focusing heavily on REIT's and Utilities that pay 6-10% dividend yields.  Both of these types of stocks are very hardened against recessions or pandemics because of the nature of what they are.... Everyone needs a place to live and everyone needs energy to live.  I also live well below my means and drastically limit any wasteful spending on things I don't need.  I should be retired in 9 years which is way before regular retirement here in Can. 

For the OP 2k is easy to get with only needing around $200 to $275K investment in Canadian REITS.  I do not know why people are suggesting more unless they are going ultra conservative with lower paying dividend yields. Now there is also taxes but with the dividend gross up credit and how dividends and distributions are taxed you still do very well."

Thats if im buying and selling occasionally throughout the year. if you want to leave your investments alone, your looking at an annual return of %2-5. Then youll want around $1.5M"
2021-05-16 18:34:28,stocks,"I'm assuming 4% drawdown yearly (That'd be $600k for a $2k monthly income).  But the market goes down, so I'd need quite a bit more so I can ride out dips.  e.g. you have 1.2 million, and the market drops by 50%, then your 4% only gets you $2k a month.  And your income could grow if the market recovers in later years.  If you had $600k, you'd have to pull out more just to survive, and that'd hamper your ability to recover.

I could live on $2k a month if I didn't have a mortgage... So I think you need either a paid-off house, or higher monthly income.  

Also age matters -- if you're near retirement age, your SS payments can contribute to your income and significantly lower what you need to come up with yourself.  If you're younger and a decade or more away from SS, you need some significant extra cushion.

I think a good number for retirement is 1.5-2 million in the bank."
2021-05-16 19:01:57,stocks,"This is my goal to be 45 and live off the stock market. Some real rough numbers for me is...

I‚Äôd be fine living off of 70k a year, current wage is 55k and I‚Äôm doing just fine.

So under the assumption of a goal of making 70k a year, how do I actually make it happen?

Assuming, the standard stock return of roughly 10%. This means I need a starting balance of 700k to make that 70k annual goal. But this is assuming that your fully invested in stock, which also means it will be volatile. So it‚Äôs not a smooth 70k a year because of the volatile nature of the stock markets. So add in another 250k for a ‚Äòsafe cushion‚Äô during volatile times. Add in another 250k I‚Äôd say for the miscellaneous expenses that will come up, from medical stuff, to repairs and projects. Whatever really.

700k + 250k + 250k = 1.2 million to be self sustaining imo. The more the merrier obviously, and if you can beat that 10% return you‚Äôll definitely be alright."

And we had about a $900 subsidy every month for our family of 4.  A bronze plan was like $300 a month (with a $15,500 deductible).

So just move to a state that offers ACA subsidies and you shouldn't have to worry about insurance."

We will absolutely have universal health insurance in the US by the time all millennials retire.

2021-05-16 11:44:35,stocks,"Well, it depends on how you earn that income.

2021-05-16 11:51:18,stocks,"If you are using investments to generate income as opposed to grow a retirement nest egg you will transition to a value oriented dividend strategy and the 4% is a doable dividend return.  However you can also keep a growth strategy and sell of 4% of the stock each year as its value hopefully will exceed that growth rate.

Another thing you need to consider is inflation.  A 4% spending rate in a 3% inflation environment needs a 7% growth rate to make work.  Reinvest 3% of the 7% and spend 4% and the reinvested 3% grows the base investment enough to inflation protect your income needs."

2021-05-16 16:23:31,stocks,"Well, you don't pay taxes on the first 80k of qualified dividend income if it's your only sources of income.  You're still going to pay capital gains on regular stocks.  Generally you're going to have your dividend stocks rise with inflation at least mostly.  Good companies are going to raise their dividend at least annually if not quarterly, so 4% now giving you 100k/year would (if done correctly and the market doesn't hose you) at least somewhat rise with inflation.  You might end up at some point under inflation but in theory you're going to have your housing paid off and you're on government medical care so a lot of your expenses go away the older you get as well which makes up for some of it.  Combined with retirement accounts you can't touch until a certain age and the potential of social security to pay out something, you can get a starting point that's fairly accurate. 

There's a lot of math but it's a great starting point if you want to figure out what your target number is based on your current income.  You can do with a bit (or a lot) less than your current paycheck with the tax implications on dividend income honestly."

As a society we become more and more progressive, that is just natural, in most ways this is good. Though I'm not a fan of the extreme left/cancel culture and all that bullshit that sometimes gets the focus. 

It's foolish to think the current system and the insane profits for insurance companies is efficient or in the best interest of society. The average American is ignorant but they are getting smarter with time. Part of the problem is it has become a political issues which is stupid as hell. 

TWO DECADES, you know 20 years lol, is a pretty fucking long time for you to be so arrogant.

Most of my resources are in Vanguard, in taxable accounts.  I have some inherited IRAs that I am leaving alone until I hit 60.  I'll use the Vanguard advisor service at 0.3% to develop a plan for 2022, which will be the first year of me not working.  I am currently in a baristaFIRE mode, breaking even on my local work while I am in school.  That will continue until the end of the year.

The CFP said he would start looking at a 65% equities fund like VTSAX with a 35% bond fund for income and stability in downturns. We haven't talked about actual vehicles and allocations, yet.    I am targeting 2.5% withdrawal rate, with a cost of living adjustment as needed.

Another part of this is geo-arbitrage.  We will be living abroad for half of the year, in low cost expat settings for the next ten years or so.  Portugal, Ecuador, Thailand, Mexico, etc.

A lot of it depends on your age, whether you plan on working and at what point you would stop.  I may still trade labor in interesting settings for room and board.  I recently completed an enology degree, and wouldn't mind bartering wine labor for lodging in Italy, Croatia, Georgia, etc."

Yeah if you cut out optional stuff it's true you can do it on the cheap.  I don't have to save for their university, they can just go and borrow for student loans.    I do these because I want them to enjoy their life.

The next year you have to sell $51,000 worth of shares to cover your expenses, but VTI has appreciated by 7% (now worth $230). So now you only have to sell 221 shares. The next year is 211, then 201, 192, etc etc. The amount of shares you need to sell to meet your living wage decreases asymptotically in a way that makes it so you'd have to live hundreds of years before you actually sold your last share, and by then they'd be selling for far more than your yearly living costs so you could just live off the proceeds in your bank account or reinvest it in something else."

It‚Äôs also foolish to think that profiteering and societal interests are suddenly going to become a flash point over the next 20 years when these things have been true for decades before and have not changed for the better. Sure, maybe we as millennials can make positive changes but there is still a giant swath of our own generation that are extremely conservative and I‚Äôd argue against any concept that Americans as a whole are becoming smarter.

Of course if the market were to crash, it would probably not be best to sell covered calls unless IV is high enough, but something like 75% of options close OTM."
2021-05-16 14:02:29,stocks,"I am not a tax expert, so this will be confusing for me to explain.

But I computed it both ways.  In this case under 65 with a 4% return is \~$40k a year income in the first year.  Money is kept in a managed savings account, like a wealth builder account at a Bank.  (good luck getting 4% in a CD or Savings product)

Over 65 that money can be in an IRA, and no taxes are paid on the interest, instead taxes are paid when money is drawn from the account.  In the example case of a 36k draw down, taxes would be paid on 36k

This is paid on the regular marginal tax rate.

Capital gains is paid on appreciation of assets, for example real estate, or stock trades lasting longer than a year.

A lot matters how and where you keep your money.  But on this example of a million dollars, I feel like, in real life we would have to look at the situation.  

For example dividends are taxed one way, and qualified dividends are taxed a different way.  

But again, I am probably splitting hairs for the purposes of this conversation.

Just know you pay regular people taxes with the income generated from a million dollars, and your tax rate increases significantly when living off the income from about $1,5 million dollars onward.

again made even more complex with marital status..."
2021-05-16 14:04:07,stocks,"Another layer of complexity, say you are 50 when you are retiring as I am, IRA's can be funded which provides a tax credit, but limits liquidity..."

2021-05-16 15:44:47,stocks,Still a dumb move. The shiny car will lose $100k in value in 5 years. If you invested that $100k you probably make $50k. So basically you are losing $30k a year to drive a fancy car. Lol

But it‚Äôs a whole other story when you‚Äôve invested consistently over a decade. It‚Äôs hard to spend any of it at all."
2021-05-16 13:34:38,stocks,"You could discern useful information from the post if the numbers were real (lol +5% monthly?) but the post is still written in a way to show off instead of helping, which is why he‚Äôs getting shit on."

2021-05-16 16:47:46,stocks,"Very true, but the point is that you can sort of treat it like a savings account that builds wealth you can withdraw at 59.5+

I'm putting about $30k a year into Roth IRA via a combination of regular contributions and mega backdoor Roth in addition to nearly maxing pre-tax. 

If I lose my job and need money, want to make a big purchase like a home, etc, I have over $70k in basis I can take out without penalty. The remaining $35k in earnings would remain in to grow until retirement. So it definitely beats taxable brokerages which create a ton of taxes that eat into returns.

If I need the wealth to retire early, I can do a Roth conversion ladder with my pre-tax 401k funds."
2021-05-16 15:26:22,stocks,"Dude. Did you win the lottery or something? Because you‚Äôre a millionaire who apparently didn‚Äôt invest to get there. 

You have one million. Put it in VTSAX. Have vanguard take out 3400 a month (adjusted for inflation) and it goes directly into your bank account, spend it. 

This money will not be taxed if it‚Äôs your only income. You won‚Äôt have capital gains taxes on it, you won‚Äôt have SS taxes, you won‚Äôt have Medicare taxes, and in most states you won‚Äôt have any state income tax.

2021-05-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Inflation: timing stocks as an hedge? Lots of people are saying stocks are the best hedge against inflation, as companies will absorb costs and raise prices. However, the current S&P yield is around 2%. If central banks raise interest rates to tame inflation, valuation of bonds and stocks will have to ajust to offer a higher yield. So if the 10 year US bond yields reach 3-4%, you can‚Äôt justify a 2% yield on S&P considering it‚Äôs a riskier asset. So current stocks valuations should fall. But then, when the S&P valuation is adjusted, it would be the perfect timing to buy/hold and hedge against inflation.

Is this thinking correct?"
2021-05-16 14:34:05,stocks,"Stocks are not the best hedge against inflation. They are decent. But not all of them will work (as usual). Historically, real assets like real estate and art."
2021-05-16 11:35:00,stocks,"In general, stocks and bonds can have trouble with inflation for different reasons. For stocks, higher cost of raw materials and higher cost of labor for stocks mean higher cost of production, and lower consumer buying power means lower demand and often lower revenues. Since valuation is dependent on earnings, valuations will fall, but there's no real indicator as to when they rise again - probably not until inflation falls, generally. 

For bonds, you have inflation risk and duration risk - the risk that your principle isn't worth as much in real money, and the risk that bonds at higher interest rates are being issued causing your bonds to lose value, respectively. 

I did a bit of a breakdown on the inflation issue [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartChicksMakeBank/comments/ndqh5a/inflation_is_it_that_bad_why_it_matters_and_what/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"

I do not think central banks will raise the rates. The bond market is only reacting to the economic cycle. Rates actually declined when the CPI blew up 4.2% on Thursday."
2021-05-16 11:10:23,stocks,"Yes and no. This is already taking place slowly over the last few months with a rotation away from overvalued tech and growth stocks and into commodities and cyclical stocks. The transition to higher rates might not be marked at all by a general selloff, especially if the real economy is doing well, but perhaps through a continued rotation with small plullbacks along the way. In that scenario the S&P would gradually adjust. In other words, there may not be a good way to time this generally.   

Commodities, companies with pricing power and treasury inflation protected securities should help hedge against inflation - but only if you believe inflation is going to be more than transitional."
2021-05-16 11:54:40,stocks,"The S&P's valuation is constantly adjusting to new information, so there's no moment where you can pinpoint where it hasn't already adjusted to the current data and expectations. There will always be uncertainty about next month's inflation and the next FOMC meeting."
2021-05-16 17:43:51,stocks,"That blow up was taken way out of proportion. Not only are you measuring from bottom to top, but used car sales helped push that number up. It really had nothing to do with inflation, and that showed when PPI numbers hadn't changed from the previous month"

2021-05-16 00:00:00,stocks,"What's causing ICLN to gradually decline since the January? Do you reckon it will recover? When I look at the graph of ICLN in the last 10 years, the there's been barely any growth in it until the pandemic hit and suddenly after April 2020, it started growing and kept growing until the beginning of January 2021.

Perhaps this sudden growth is down to the optimism that Biden will promote renewable energy, along with the US government's cash injection to boost the economy during the pandemic.

However, now that ICLN is back to its normal trend (4/2011 - 3/2020), do you reckon it will come back to north trending graph any time soon? I bought ICLN at the end of February and now it's more than 27% down. Do you reckon it will grow back any time soon? Or should I give up on it?"

2021-05-16 11:31:01,stocks,"If you look at macro factors, there's a few things that are doing bad for ICLN:

1. Cost of raw materials is putting aggressive downward pressure on green energy stocks for manufacturing wind turbines, solar panels, etc

2. Inflation fears are hurting future growth potential by reducing the value of future revenues 

3. No further mention of green energy by Biden administration

Here are things going for ICLN:

1. Wind and solar are cheaper than petrol

2. Consumer sentiment moving towards renewables as millenials take over more spending than baby boomers

3. National security threats of having a centralized electric grid, and how distributed energy generation will protect national security going forward


Also, the commitment of ICLN to include such a big portion of their portfolio (before rebalancing) to hydrogen energy plays. This was a bad move, and their rebalancing has helped to reduce the exposure to PLUG and FCEL.

ICLN has been in a 5 year bear market, the question is whether you believe in the next 5 years it will lose out to traditional energy."

They don't even manufacture electronic chips (higher demand growth yoy) or have cornered majority of market like TSMC.

2021-05-16 16:31:13,stocks,"Probably not anytime soon (within next 5 years, at least). Many of its holdings were incredibly optimistically priced for future earnings, so the rise in interest rates will cause massive multiple contractions for most of their holdings as discount rates on future cashflows increase (which we have been seeing since February). On top of this, their largest holding, PLUG, was caught doing fraudulent accounting and is getting investigated by the SEC for it. Some of their holdings have been missing revenue and earnings estimates as well, which is causing individual holdings in this ETF to tank as well, further driving down the price. There are a lot of better growth-oriented investments that you could make instead of this IMO.

It's also entirely possible that many of these companies will never take sufficient market share from existing utilities and electrical component manufacturers to justify a growth multiple.

I'm not sure. As of now, it's mostly been a lip service around the world. Major countries like Russia, Brazil, USA etc. still keep pursuing fossil fuel sources, while countries like Germany don't seem to stop using fossil fuel and becoming carbon neutral any time soon, at least not until 2045, and that's a long ass time. The whole world seem quite pretentious about it and very little progress has been made.

>Can you wait that long? Is there something else you'd rather be invested in?

I would have waited 4-5 years if I could be convinced that it will produce results, but I can't wait 30 years and I doubt that's practical at all. I have other options like IHI where I could invest more.

It's the future - everyone says so!"" without giving any thought to what price you're buying in at and whether those future cash flow numbers 10+ years out will be realized in absolute amount but also within a 10 year timeframe....)

For the last 12 months or so, the EV and energy transition space has exhibited just about every symptom that occurs with over priced and overinflated assets. If you don't believe me, go take a look at where most publicly traded EV stocks that were taken public by way of deSPAC IPO + merger with the SPAC entity. The private equity firm that funded the initial PIPE placement doesn't have the risk exposure that the public does, so what incentive do they have to push any sort of realistic valuation, especially when these offerings are 10x over subscribed.....based on 2030E revenue multiples.....that public investors will buy regardless based on anecdotal hype and cognitive dissonance on being a ""natural"" at stock picking, since most of these investor bought into the market in April 2020 and have realized 40%+ returns......."

1) She has some wild valuations for her favorite picks. Tesla lived up to it but is an anomaly. For example her price target and valuation for SQ is out there. 

2) Her strategy seems to be: Find the most innovative and disruptive sectors: EV, Genomics, Fintech, 5G, etc. Then throw her funds at emerging companies disregarding the valuations and hope one of her picks emerge as a winner. 

She bought COIN and RBLX when they IPO's at insane valuation and is stuck bag holding. She is gobbling up shares of SKLZ (which is crazy speculative company).

Simply searching 'ark inexperienced' comes up with these articles. Morningstar, a pretty big rating company, said pretty much what I said - and its bang on in my eyes. The team aren't idiots by any means, but Cathy is the only one with experience managing a fund, and the next in line for when they leave doesn't show evidence that they'll remotely be able to replicate ARK's success, given the choices are based on Cathies gut feeling.

Cathie has had good instincts over the last year - but prior to ARK she underperformed with her funds, and she listens to her instincts over quantitative valuation methods. Innovative tech is fantastic - but her method of choosing them seems 1- incredibly high risk, and 2- luck based.

We've yet to see ARK during a bare market, and I guess it'll be disproportionately volatile compared to the returns they've yielded thus far."

2) Price crashes below short position value. 

Neither of those things has happened, which is why it's consolidating around the ~150 range despite MM's actively trying to deflate the price. ""Some shorts covered"" is not close enough to the massive short interest still in play to stop a squeeze. Brokerages had to literally remove the ability to buy the stock to prevent it last time, and the price has expectedly surged back up because those same conditions that created the first gamma squeeze still exist.

Lots of low market cap stocks can be moved by very few people and a lot of people were buying gme (like 60% of retail investors held some gme at some point). I am asking a legitimate question because I don't know the answer and I would like someone to give an explanation but I don't think ""look at the graph"" means anything.

Should note that most gme subs still think the short squeeze is yet to come."
2021-05-16 10:41:29,stocks,Stay away. Buy SPY or QQQ and sleep like a baby
2021-05-16 15:47:45,stocks,I am too. It showed up in my TD Ameritrade. It may depend on your broker but most can trade foreign exchanges
2021-05-16 17:27:06,stocks,don't you have access to global stocks? I would assume all brokers allow it.
2021-05-16 17:52:04,stocks,No actual reason. For vanguard ETFs I have VDE and VTI.
2021-05-16 17:22:07,stocks,It's not happening lol. Its been 3 months
2021-05-16 13:45:46,stocks,RemindMe! 6 months
2021-05-16 12:58:42,stocks,Lol delusion much?
2021-05-16 11:43:16,stocks,"Math really has nothing to do with this. A short squeeze is nothing more than shorts being forced to cover thereby forcing the price to increase. There is irrefutable evidence that short covering did occur, which forced the price higher."
2021-05-16 12:59:37,stocks,Most GME subs are Q holes now I wouldn‚Äôt trust anything they said.
2021-05-16 12:23:46,stocks,Its been 5 months man. What time period will you admit it's over?
2021-05-16 18:12:08,stocks,I thought so put it won‚Äôt pull for me on fidelity or TD
2021-05-16 17:33:00,stocks,"It‚Äôs been 3 months and the price is steady at a rate that everyone agrees is way above realistic market value. The reason? Enormous short interest.

It costs hedge funds tens of millions of dollars every day to hold their unsuccessful short positions. It costs holders nothing, and every time the price goes down the volume spikes and the price goes back up. 

Something has to give, and nothing so far is telling me that it‚Äôs gonna be retail investors. I‚Äôm willing to risk $10k to make $100k+, which is a completely realistic return in the increasingly likely event of a squeeze. 

It‚Äôs definitely a risk but fortune favors the bold and the potential returns here can fast forward your savings and retirement goals by decades, so do as you feel is best for you."
2021-05-16 11:44:10,stocks,Citadel has not covered yet stop spreading FUD.
2021-05-16 12:10:16,stocks,Haha math has everything to do with this wtf
2021-05-16 12:47:27,stocks,Where is the irrefutable evidence?
2021-05-16 12:04:09,stocks,I think it‚Äôs probably worth looking into more than the explanation you provide. Not quite that simple.
2021-05-16 13:03:13,stocks,"Oh I don't believe them and am not subbed to any of them. My question has been completely twisted into ""gme is going to $10M per share"" when I am legitimately just asking if the spike it had in January was a proper squeeze or just it becoming the most popular retail stock."

2021-05-16 13:24:25,stocks,"Long story short **there was a squeeze** but opinion's differ on whether it was ***the squeeze*** or not.

For example, if you (like DeepFucking Value) bought GME at $4 a share. The stock going to $400+ was the squeeze of a lifetime. It was a x100 return on investment.

If you bought GME at $300+ however (as most late entrants did) then the squeeze **did not happen**, because you didn't get anything, or at least not the x10 you were told was possible. You were cheated, robbed, there was a conspiracy against you by the hedge funds, the media...whoever... so now you sit in r/gme or r/superstonk wrapping your brain in more and more tinfoil till you believe $10m a share is a realistic valuation...

It was for a time the most popular retail stock. What is left now is an associated culture that has turned GME ownership into some kind of 'cause' which is not the way to go about making money and the definition of trading emotionally."

So a convincing case was made yesterday that the market will drop again on Monday because of a lot of selloffs to pay for people's income taxes. Futures are currently at light gains. Have tax day drops been so predictable in the past that there's much chance the market actually won't be red because the drop is anticipated and some larger funds be set up to buy the dip?
2021-05-16 08:57:16,stocks,People would have had to sell last week for the money to settle by Monday. More of a convincing case as to last week‚Äôs sell off.

2021-05-16 09:59:59,stocks,Smart people who have money aren‚Äôt selling for tax payments on the day of the deadline. We already have the money to pay our taxes. Small retails scrambling to make it will not effect the market.

2021-05-16 00:00:00,stocks,"The Weekly DD - AT&T (T): A Bond Proxy What if I told you there was a stock that offers a \~6-7% dividend AND has potential for revenue growth, is that something you would be interested in? That company is AT&T (T) and we‚Äôll break-down some opportunities & challenges this cash-generating machine faces in the mid-to-long term.

**The Overview**

AT&T has three business segments: Communications, Warner Media, and Latin America. AT&T‚Äôs communications segment contributes \~79% of operating revenues and \~80% of profits. AT&T‚Äôs recent acquisition of Warner Media adds to AT&T‚Äôs development, production, and distribution capabilities. The Warner Media acquisition has been broadly successful, comprising 17% of AT&T‚Äôs revenues and 22% of profits. Warner Bros. is one of the largest TV and film studios globally, remains a media powerhouse with a profound content library that reaches audiences across many platforms.

In this day and age huge ‚Äúvalue‚Äù is seen in the amount of users or customers a company has reached. A quick glance at Zoom and we can see that a large portion of their value comes from the 300 million users they leverage. Coming back to AT&T they have over 170 million customers across numerous products to go along with a broad array of content rights.

**HBO Max**

One of AT&T‚Äôs biggest risks over the next 5 years comes from their acquisition of HBO Max. Main concerns are over whether or not they can retain or grow the service‚Äôs subscriber base and ultimately increase earnings. Management has recently [**increased expectations**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/at-t-raises-hbo-max-target-to-as-many-as-150-million-subscribers#:~:text=AT&T%20Inc.,key%20to%20the%20company) of the HBO Max subscription base to reach between 120 to 150 million subscribers by 2025, which is up from their relatively conservative estimate of 75-90 million in 2019. Here‚Äôs a look from their recent earnings presentation  

AT&T is progressing in its postpaid wireless, and HBO Max segments, which saw \~800k lines and an additional **\~3.5M subscribers added in their previous two quarters**. Consumers are willing to spend more on high-quality internet service as work from home continues.

**Final Thoughts**

When we look at AT&T‚Äôs share price over the last 10 years and we see the stock is up roughly 10% during that time-period it doesn‚Äôt necessarily instill confidence as a profitable investment. Some might argue why purchasing shares of AT&T would be a better investment than a ‚Äúmore secure‚Äù bond play. However, it is our opinion that AT&T is at a turning point and we may now be able to see the best of both worlds, a high yield dividend return, as well as steady growth in revenues.

A 5% return per annum, paired with its high dividend yield of \~6-7%, allows AT&T to remain more attractive than treasury bonds even with the associated risk of holding shares. Despite increased debt levels and decreased credit ratings, AT&T has a strong strategy to reduce its debt burden. AT&T should continue to have a dividend payout ratio at roughly 50% of FCF, acting as a bond proxy in an investor‚Äôs portfolio.

**Positions Disclosure:** It can be assumed the author of this article has a long position in the stock."
2021-05-16 08:49:04,stocks,I think this company is really shitty to its customers though so I‚Äôm out.
2021-05-16 09:10:22,stocks,"I think that the company is good from a dividend standpoint. A 7% yield that is also sustainable offers a good chance for passive income. The management is also trying to reduce the debt which I always thought was a big negative, but that is changing."
2021-05-16 10:51:39,stocks,"Yes, ATT is pretty shit on the customer focus side of things. One thing on their side, if they get it right, is the fact that the own the content(Warner media) and the rails(HBO max). They need to innovate media distribution and link smartphone activity data and media activity to innovate the media supply chain. They also need to shed some assets *cough* AOL and use the assets that are still relevant as growth centers. Are they going to pop to 60? No. Might they establish a new floor at 40 while maintaining their dividend? It‚Äôs possible."
2021-05-16 10:57:52,stocks,"Big dividend but management has been consistently ignorant, nothing about this company looks healthy fundamentally..
As a customer, I was in the military in 2011 and got deployed..I had my account frozen because of this so they wouldn‚Äôt bill me..they unfroze the account in the 2nd month and I came home to a 400$ bill they refused to waive despite my situation...they ended up reporting it to collections...
When my wife was 16 she worked at one of their call centers and described it as a shady business..

Idk why some people like the stock, seems much riskier than people think..."

2021-05-16 10:35:11,stocks,I'm at a loss to how so many people think this disaster of a company with more debt than entire nations and a reputation for one of the most anti-consumer brands in the world is a high quality investment.
2021-05-16 09:56:13,stocks,"I'm really curious to see their HBO Max subscriber numbers in the coming quarters. I had locked in the promo pricing for 12 months and that was up for me this month, so I cancelled. Curious to know if others will, too. Also thought I heard them say new movies will revert back to theater only soon, rather than simulatenous release in theater and on Max for 30 days. Plus, more streaming service options seem to keep popping up/rebranding, which means more competition."
2021-05-16 12:49:07,stocks,What are your thoughts on the new asset combination talks with Discovery?

2021-05-16 00:00:00,stocks,"What is the general sentiment about the stock market? Hello all,

I‚Äôm curious to hear what other redditor‚Äôs opinions are on the current market. Do you see it continue to rise within the next year? Do you expect a crash? A correction? What are your thoughts on the state of the housing market over the next two years? How bad of a hit do you expect stocks/housing to take when rates eventually go up. 

I understand this all speculation and no one knows what will happen, just curious to see if anyone has any opinions and why, based on what you‚Äôre seeing.

I personally believe stocks will keep going up with a few corrections but no big crash. I think the big one will happen within the next 5-10 years due to a financial crisis. As for the housing frenzy, I believe that will burn out in a couple years and drive prices down ~20%.

Your thoughts?"

2021-05-16 03:01:43,stocks,2 more weeks
2021-05-16 07:15:22,stocks,"Rising inflation has an insidious effect: input prices are higher, consumers can purchase fewer goods, revenues, and profits decline, and the economy slows for a time until a measure of economic equilibrium is reached.

Value stocks perform better in high inflation periods and growth stocks perform better during low inflation.

When inflation is on the upswing, income-oriented or high-dividend-paying stock prices generally decline.

Stocks overall do seem to be more volatile during highly inflationary periods."
2021-05-16 02:54:26,stocks,Inflation will make stocks and houses cost more
2021-05-16 10:29:25,stocks,Its about to take off again specifically all the growth stocks I panic sold for a 30% loss except I wont have the balls to buy back in until I finally FOMO in at the very top and it all crashes again. $ROPE gang in da house!
2021-05-16 07:52:36,stocks,"Everybody is expecting an outright crash. 4 months ago I predicted wed have 3 or 4 controlled pullbacks centered around specific events. One was the last stimulus check and the 2nd was before tax returns went out. We've had 2 of those already. We might get more stimulus so maybe an extra pullback is now due but after the last pullback we soared to a new record and I'd expect the same thing to happen here. 

I think the least likely event is an outright crash. But if everybody is expecting it and stops buying it can turn into a self fulfilling prophecy. I think people just dont understand why the stock market crashed because of covid. The whole world stopped for a month.  We just dont have any catalyst like that in our future. Not to say it cant happen, but I think it's the least likely of the pullback scenarios."
2021-05-16 09:23:53,stocks,"I think the markets are looking for a legitimate reason to sell of, but hasn't found it. The skittishness will not go away until an event pushes the market to properly sell and continue selling. We have only seen cautionary selling in advance of possible terrible news thus far IMO. This shows me the markets are actually a lot stronger than it feels, (due to skittishness), and will continue to grow. Growth stocks still have remained beat down for months are due to rise soon if the market stabilizes a bit."
2021-05-16 10:11:27,stocks,The market is the market
2021-05-16 08:28:43,stocks,"I'm bearish. There has never been a time in the history of the entire stock market where 5 year returns have been positive after the CAPE ratio exceeds 35. We are at 37. I understand that history doesn't predict the future, but the fact that it had never happened obviously indicates significance."
2021-05-16 03:14:20,stocks,"Buffet indicator? Super high. Margin debt? Super high. Wealthy selling out stock? Yes  Hard to time a thing obviously, but in my opinion market is on edge and any further disruption can turn slow unwinding into crash.

Later in future inflation will make stocks go up, but in meantime ride may be rough."
2021-05-16 12:04:00,stocks,"This question, when asked at any point in the history of the stock market, will get three answers.

1) The stock market has to keep going up because of X Y Z

2) The stock market is certain to go down because of A B C

3) The stock market will likely stay the course because of XYZ and ABC

At every point in economic history, there will be a group which has each one of these consensus views. Nobody knows the definitive answer. If they did, they would become the wealthiest person in the world very quickly. Imagine walking into a casino and playing blackjack while knowing every card (and not getting kicked out). 

Nobody knows for certain what will happen, and there will always be people that believe the stock market will go down (for good reasons) and those that believe the stock market will go up (for good reasons too). 

Personally, I think it will continue to grow over the short and medium-term. But I don't pretend to have an objective answer."

2021-05-16 06:15:53,stocks,"Seems like we‚Äôre on a roller coaster oscillating between corrections and continued enthusiasm for a post-Covid economy. Check how the tech stocks climbed since the start of the year, they‚Äôre slowly falling back to their initial price points. We‚Äôll have to see how much more correction will take place as people are still confident in the tech sector on the long term. On the short term (this year) the semiconductor shortage will sure play a massive role in determining how the tech sector performs. Best we can do is fasten our seat belts and buy low in increments."

That you can't predict crashes and/or the market reliably

Everybody who does is full of shit."
2021-05-16 03:18:45,stocks,"It‚Äôs the same it always is. The optimists think the bull run will last forever. The pessimists think it‚Äôs going to crash and burn the likes we‚Äôve never seen. The realists take both scenarios into account and have strategies to deal with both.

Personally, I think we‚Äôre in a bubble because all the companies that lost money went back up to previous levels but the earnings and cutbacks seem to have yet to see daylight and investors eyes."
2021-05-16 05:15:44,stocks,"My thoughts? Markets only go up. Short term predictions are useless, long term there's no other way for the markets to go but up."
2021-05-16 08:00:49,stocks,i think its super overvalued and im waiting it out untill i get an oppertunity.
2021-05-16 04:46:10,stocks,"I think things will keep growing relatively consistently but slowly until about this time next year. That's when I think the fed with bump up interest rates and we'll see a mass exodus from the market resulting in a ~15-20% drop. The drop will be bigger than expected due to pent up fear but will recover relatively quickly.

Housing I think will plateau mid summer but not decline, house prices will stagnate for ~1 year until demand catches up to valuations. I would love a drop though, looking to buy around March next year.

It'll be fun to see how accurate this actually ends up being."
2021-05-16 04:16:20,stocks,"I am bullish but I expect another correction of about 10-15% down from where we are today. Too many uncertainties right now, the biggest being inflation and Biden's tax ideas. A third round of Covid might come, but vaccinations are getting to a critical level even in Europe, so I am less worried now.

At the end of the day, a correction might be a good thing. Fundamentals are solid, economies are still just opening up. It might be an opportunity to rotate into stocks that thrived pre Covid and are now again set to pop.

Let's all just hope that the people who margined the shit out of their portfolio are ready for another big drop, because if they are not, their stuff will be force sold and markets will drop even more.

I have been building up a bit of cash for a few months to buy stuff on a quick crash recovery. We'll see."

2021-05-16 10:45:38,stocks,"I don't really care what the sentiment is. I did the research and built my strategy around numbers and facts. 

I hold SCHD because it's based on an index, indexing is safe and boring, SCHD performs at least equal to but usually better than the market, it pays out better dividends, dividend reinvestment results in much better returns than straight capital appreciation, and a 15% trailing stop loss order good til cancelled that I update and refresh every time I buy more to manage risk of another March 2020. 

Once I'm stopped out I'll start paying attention to daily and weekly MACD and market moving news.

In the next 12 months, I'm sure there will be a major correction (but not a crash, yet). The Fed can't keep printing money and giving it away like it's christmas with zero interest. The bubble is going to eventually pop.

Ride the train as long as it's going up, but just be prepared to jump ship before it tanks."
2021-05-16 08:48:35,stocks,60% chance of a great depression as not many are expecting it now.  I think in 1929 during the roaring 20s NO one expected anything to crash because demand was so high.  Then it literally shifted overnight when leverage blew up the system.

When it does... hold on to your seat and try to have some money on the side to buy when there‚Äôs blood in the streets.

The switch away from fossil fuels and to things like electric cars has unstoppable momentum and it's going to generate a huge amount of economic activity. Coming out of the pandemic is also going to create a lot of economic activity for a couple of years. Vacations and celebrations and family visits were all delayed. If you want to get political, the stock market does better under Dems and the way the GOP is self destructing is promising for Dems maintaining control for the long term."
2021-05-16 07:58:34,stocks,"After looking at my crystal ball‚Ä¶I see a slow walk down 10 or 20% then stagnation for a few years. I only see a crash if there is a catalyst. High growth stocks have started walking down and then everything else will follow. Several down days followed by a few up days that do not recover the loss. Maybe sideways movement for the FAANG / good blue chip dividend payers. 

My reasons are inflation even if it is temporary (don‚Äôt think it is), interest rate increases to fight it, supply chain issues, Congress and several states increasing taxes later this year, other countries Covid restrictions affecting supply chains and tourism, out of control debt leading to talk of government shutdown at end of year. I could keep going‚Ä¶

All the reasons the market had been reaching all time highs are quickly being reversed. 

The housing market will stagnate (already starting because of lumber prices) and with the rise in interest rates and taxes many will be priced out of the market. 

What is that saying? Oh right‚Ä¶elections have consequences."

But a slight increase in interest rate will push the market to the edge, which the market is already hanging by a thread. I think the bullish run is over. We might see a market correction until Q1 of 2022 and a crash then after when housing bubble pops. We could also see a lost decade.

2021-05-16 10:07:25,stocks,"The market will climb higher due to enormous government spending but a 10-20% correction is also possible due to inflationary risks that will cause the Fed to pull the punch bowl away.   That's what we're seeing happening this past week, as the bond/stock market tries to price in Fed tapering/ending QE.

If you want to know where the stock market is headed, just watch the bond market.  Two percent, 10 year bond yields will be the best SHTF indicator.   We were almost a 1.7% on Wednesday (the S&P was down down by 2.17%) but bonds closed down on Friday just above 1.63% and the S&P rallied 1.49%.  The stock market is trading inversely to bond yields.

The stock market is also pretty good at discounting things that are predictable, it takes a while though.  It's the Black Swan events that are most dangerous."

However, the longer brrrrr goes on for, the more bearish I get for the long term. Productivity will get crushed under the weight of massive national debt, which is has been exponentially increasing since 2008. It's not sustainable. They can't even allow the 10 year yield to get above 3% without the market crashing, and this was before the 30%+ increase in money supply due to COVID. Now markets get nervous even at 1.7%."
2021-05-16 11:22:43,stocks,"Asset valuations will continue to increase until interest rates rise. 

In the longer term, deflationary forces are stronger than the inflationary ones, so any rises in interest rates will be relatively short lived.

The silver lining is that deflation means you won't need your assets to grow too fast in order to buy more stuff."
2021-05-16 12:25:17,stocks,Both my total stock market index funds went significantly down this past two weeks. Something bad is brewing. Hedge funds are over leveraged from shorting stocks to oblivion thanks to banks unlimited loans it seems. Market is crooked and rigged.

Projecting a 50-65 percent crash. All numbers are compared to 1973 crash and 2007 crash. Have yet to run dot com crash, likely even worse because all the speculation going on right now. Inverse funds, shorting and put options will be the play when this occurs. Expect a rally after a month or two trying to come back but it‚Äôll get beat right back down after a false rally.

The housing market is extremely strong -- your comment about prices coming down 20% is probably no where near correct.  Housing prices fell nearly 18% during the the worst year of the global financial crisis.  The US has been under producing homes in every year following the crisis and we are still only producing enough to match new home formations less destroyed homes now.  The price increases will moderate and could level off or fall with the inflation that is being created by current government policy... but not near 20%."

The metrics of the stock market equate to that pre-2008, and it doesn't look good. I see to my eyes that there will be huge spending on retail throughout demand, though this arguably is artificial demand funded by BORROWED money not EARNT money. The Debts of countries all around the world are reaching mountain tops and from a fiscal side of things, it is not looking sustainable."

2021-05-16 13:50:23,stocks,"So much hysteria in these comments. Tells you all you need to know.

Just my personal opinion of course."
2021-05-16 15:02:50,stocks,"I expect a correction by the end of the year, and if not, at least a short bear market that ends up being roughly equivalent to a correction. There are numerous red flags floating around, from hyped-up new retail investors overextending into speculative assets from *[coins of a digital nature]* (up to 100x leverage available which is terrifying) to companies (and even entire sectors) that have never turned a profit, overzealous promoting of the market by institutions that signals a feed off of FOMO from last year's massive 1-year return, record high margin debt, record high IPOs over the last 2 years, and the impression that no matter what you buy, it will work out in the long run (no price is too high, stonks only go up, HODL ad infinitum). All this in light of the fact that the global economy just took and continues to endure its most serious hit since 2008, which doesn't add up to me. It's playing to trends and euphoric expectations, and that has never, not once, ended well for the average joe in the relative short term (1-2 years).

Inflation isn't even necessary, IMO, to see that the market is in a place where it has found itself multiple times before. Either history repeats itself once again, or this time is different."

It's going to start as big out flows from the ETFs, maybe -5%, but instead of a +4% rebound the following day, it'll be -9% the next day, and worse the next day, etc.

Gold still won't budge, because it's the most critical store of wealth and the Price fixing cartel, aka the government's. They know if gold is allowed to go up, the whole jig is up.

Bitcoin won't do as well as some hope. Not because it's slow and cumbersome, but because a single BTC transaction consumes the same amount of electricity as charging a Tesla for 70,000miles!"
2021-05-16 16:45:53,stocks,"Completely disillusioned. The fed keeps printing money and dismissing inflation. Margin numbers are sky high. Then reading thru Michael Burry's warnings before the SEC went to his house and asked him to delete Twitter sealed the deal for me. The fast-tracking of new rules by the SEC and DTTC to create a more manageable/survivable pathway for a crash they've perhaps been expecting for a few years just adds to the confirmation bias. 

The only question left for me is whether it will be worse than 2008 and if any of the institutional recklessness will go punished this time or the narrative that the retail investor was somehow at fault will continue."
2021-05-16 16:48:15,stocks,Housing will continue to go up (due to lack of inventory) and interest rates will remain low.  I believe the stock market will have more dips in the next few weeks (buying opportunities) and will increase throughout the rest of the year.

2021-05-16 17:53:43,stocks,When you say the stock market you have to back up and look at the individual indexes because pullbacks are typically a rotation from value to growth and Vice versa. Most of value is overextended so short term we have to rotate to growth or market overall has to come down. There is a wide divergence on the indexes from the SMA and we all know the rubber band effect so it‚Äôs gonna most likely chop it‚Äôs way sideways and down a little over next few years till we digest this massive move upwards. Look at the monthly charts of SPY and QQQ and you can see the risks. Look at the growth stocks too and see how far away they are on the monthly charts. 2018-2019 we had to digest the move up from 2016-2017 so I wouldn‚Äôt be suprised to be around here in a few years with lots of fits and starts.

2021-05-16 08:49:08,stocks,"Inflation is not some magic.

Prices can be jacked up because there is more demand, it's where the growth really happens and profits along side with it. 

Deflation is where there is no demand because lack of interest or lack of people being able to afford it, thus they need to lower prices, fire workers and thus having less people being capable of buying it, reducing profits and growth. 

We been living in inflation all of our lives. The rising interest rates if it gets out of control is what is actually scaring the markets. Margin requirements are jacked up, loans are getting more expensive and hard to get, that is the real killer of the markets."
2021-05-16 07:22:26,stocks,"This is my concern too.

I don't dispute there will be a correction, but money will quickly be reallocated back to successful companies and the market prices will stay ""high"".

The only way I can see a long term correction is if central banks significantly jack interest rates. And frankly I cannot see that happening for a few years."

Sure it will be a somewhat more expensive rate but up here houses are overvalued by hundreds of thousands imo."
2021-05-16 10:40:28,stocks,"Inflation will bring the markets to their knees.

It means rising interest rates and actual competition for your investments.

If a safe investment were to pay 3 percent interest you'd see outflows from the markets but right now there is no other choice for yield.

Rates rising also slows housing."
2021-05-16 18:32:19,stocks,"Isn‚Äôt inflation at like 1% right now? Unless I‚Äôm missing something, that suggests we‚Äôre more likely to experience deflation. I‚Äôve also not seen a spike in housing so I‚Äôm wondering where this sentiment comes from. It‚Äôs also hard to trust growth rates now because of the initial Covid reaction. A lot of companies I‚Äôve seen have recently released their Q1 numbers which would have their revenue growth rate for the quarter look like 30% but -5% YoY.

People forget the PE ratio hit over 100 in 2009 for the SP500 but in hindsight that's one of the best times ever to throw money in the market. Ratios are bad representations of indicators for the market when outlier events happen.

Factor in that there isn't another place to put money to get a ""good"" return right now, the huge influx of money from the government, etc then it also makes sense that ratios would run hit right now. Various indicator ratios have been getting high with increasing frequency since 1999. You can attribute that to many things, but decreasing bond returns and rates is one theme helping direct more money toward the stock market."

If you're not on a cash account, and you regularly buy/sell shares, or even buy another company within 2 days of selling your shares, you're going into margin debt, and that helps to run the number up quite a bit."

Hedge funds have known about inflationary issues for months now, there's no new news here, and yet markets have continued to follow their upward trend. Retail sales numbers were poor, jobless claims have been poor lately, and PPI numbers seen no real change since last month. 

CPI numbers were carried by used car sales giving people the false idea that inflation had began to run rampant and that shit was about to hit the fan, but evidently PPI numbers proved that the fall was unwarranted, thus why we seen the turn around over the following days. To see a crash, we really need a catalyst bigger than inflation worries, because inflation worries give people more of a reason to convert their cash to assets. 

Also worth adding that money velocity plays a factor when it comes to inflation. Money is also not just being printed and handed out, its simply being made easier to lend."

I doubt they will raise rates because it will make housing fall. I think many home owners and Boomers have their wealth tied up in their house and it would be catastrophic for them if a crash happened. 

Not everyone is house poor either. 

Immigration into Canada is going increase drastically for the foreseeable future, imo, and those people need housing. Additionally, much of the job growth is in the major centers of Toronto and Vancouver which I expect to create migration inflows from within Canada. This will continue to add demand pressure to housing.

Also, a rate increase will make Canada's massive deficits more expensive. Frankly they would  rather have high inflation so long as it doesn't create unacceptably high unemployment. If inflation rises, real estate and assets will also rise. Hopefully your wages follow.

2021-05-16 11:53:14,stocks,"Agree about printing money. Interest rates can go past zero, however. Look at EU bank negative interest rates. I‚Äôm not bearish. There is no 2020 crash coming in next few years. Fed will raise interest rates in 2023 then, yes, correction in stock will occur which is normal."
2021-05-16 14:47:27,stocks,Just go look at the eurozone during the past couple of years
2021-05-16 12:01:09,stocks,"This is not about adjusting for the recent drop in rates. It is about adjusting for the secular decline in rates over the past 40 years. The last time the CAPE was this high, the 10yr had a yield of 5%. If you just use CAPE data while ignoring the relative bond market I think you will get overly pessimistic predictions. 

Personally I am pretty skeptical of excess yield or CAPE predictions of future returns."
2021-05-16 03:57:11,stocks,"I‚Äôll link this eye-opener article [here](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4371273-buffett-is-genius-investor-is-why-you-should-forget-indicator)

But the main pointers being: 

1. Tax rates

2. More overseas revenues and profits

3. Interest rates and inflation are lower

4. Buffett himself seems to have lost confidence in the indicator"
2021-05-16 10:34:07,stocks,"Would you not have to consider the US companies‚Äô percentage of world GDP? If GDP is the same as it was in 2000 but US companies make half their profits overseas compared to 10% in 2000 then your indicator would almost certainly go way up even if there was no P/E expansion. I don‚Äôt know what the actual numbers are and your indicator might still be high taking that into account, just pointing out that it still doesn‚Äôt seem like a great indicator"
2021-05-16 08:33:04,stocks,"Obviously, no one should take anything here seriously. But again, that doesn't mean it's not fun to guess and speculate."
2021-05-16 19:31:46,stocks,"nobody can time it but we can get it close, thats why bezzos, gates, buffet already sold billions in stock this month"
2021-05-16 08:27:17,stocks,Goal would be to look for statistical outliers
2021-05-16 09:05:41,stocks,"Yes, doing it consistently is hard or even impossible, I agree.  But your original statement makes it seems like there's never warning signs, and that to look for them would be futile.  However, there were warning signs prior to the '07/'08 crisis, and a lot of people saw them apart from Michael Burry.  The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission made it clear in their report that the narrative that ""nobody could have seen this coming"" was false.  People could have seen it coming - the warning signs were ample - and many did.  It's just that they were ignored."
2021-05-16 03:36:23,stocks,"Many companies just had record quarterly earnings. I think a lot of companies have recovered or are about to fully recover. Main ones still down are AMC, Disney, etc."
2021-05-16 08:45:22,stocks,"For several times in the history, US stock market went down for a decade. And for other country, like Japan, it can be several decades"
2021-05-16 12:50:12,stocks,"Right, as I mentioned in my first comment. But I'm sure there were at least a few cases where an older person put most of what they had in the market at the top in 2000 and then retired less than 10 years later. They'd be fucked. Just pointing out it's not always growth, growth, growth for every case, even in a decade plus timespan."
2021-05-16 11:06:37,stocks,I think a lot of these investment subs have gone to shit since the GME fiasco. Most of these people are pushing for a crash because they will say it‚Äôs due to GME.
2021-05-16 09:23:59,stocks,"Ya, the doom and gloom never seems to fade. I'll take advantage of the drops as they come but I certainly don't see a big or even mediocre sized drop on the way anytime soon."
2021-05-16 09:34:58,stocks,"Nobody can predict the market but I see more pfizer, shell or unilever gain 10% than lose it in the next few months. Their business is surprisingly solid and improving + current evaluations are not bad looking at the fundamentals.

Just my opinion, I am all in with this kind of stocks now so I hope I am not wrong lol."

If you think they're a lie, then is every statistic released by the government a lie? Are jobless claims a lie? Are home sales numbers a lie?"
2021-05-16 08:25:25,stocks,Correct for long term capital gains. I just assumed it was short term bc you said over the last year. My b
2021-05-16 05:28:59,stocks,So pretty much when we see SPY or QQQ take a huge dip then that‚Äôs the correction we‚Äôve been waiting for?
2021-05-16 10:23:06,stocks,As Marv90 suggests. Compare different indexes. $COMPQ versus SPY versus QQQs show that the hot money is chasing hot stocks (like Google) the last indexes to turn will be the boomer investment sectors like SPY  & DJ Indexes..
2021-05-16 04:33:28,stocks,The percentage of GDP lost due to COVID was 11%

2021-05-16 06:42:19,stocks,It‚Äôs not going to. We underbuilt housing stock by about 5 million homes in the US over the last decade. People are not overpaying due to building materials prices. They are overpaying due to lack of current supply. You have increased building materials prices reducing the number of future homes that a contractor can build profitably. No one is going to sell their house now and go rent just to time the housing market. Buying/selling a home costs 10s of thousands of dollars in transaction fees and you would be speculating that somehow the housing supply will in the next 3-5 years magically meet the demand of millennials that are entering their 30s and looking to buy a new home. Your local real estate agent is not going to have any idea what the market will look like in 3 years. Screen shot this.
2021-05-16 10:40:50,stocks,This time it's personal.  Coming soon to a market near you.  Summer 2021
2021-05-16 18:44:10,stocks,That's all the confirmation I need.  Buying all calls and puts as we speak I'll DM you when I hit 10 billion(soon).

2021-05-16 16:18:03,stocks,"Correct but if they can afford it more power to them. If someone wants to outbid someone else  on a house in a highly inflated market, they either know what they‚Äôre doing or they‚Äôre about to learn a valuable lesson. 

Either way, as long as their mortgages are fixed, they will still end up with a piece of property that might lose its value when rates go down. But the property will be there and they will live in it. Should they try to sell it in a bear market they‚Äôll lose money on it.

Again what‚Äôs the problem? If market crashes and economy tanks there‚Äôll be a supply of cheaper houses on the market so people who‚Äôve been putting money away for down payment will be able to buy in. They have to wait for the right time to do so bc they can‚Äôt compete with moneybags right now in sellers market."

2021-05-16 17:26:01,stocks,"Really, the main point that I was trying to get at is that the fed is propping up the market, manipulating pricing with their interference. They can't manipulate forever because if they do then it will cause other problems that are worse..."
2021-05-16 07:53:33,stocks,I think the overseas is a massive factor. Even lots of stuff is compared to GDP. But now it's a worldwide GDP consideration for a lot of companies imo.
2021-05-16 11:31:38,stocks,"That's a absolutely valid pick up, but I had problem to find a such thing like ""US companies‚Äô percentage of world GDP"", or rather some factor which consists of US GDP plus foreign revenues. I take that into consideration so I mostly look at pace change. In years 2002 - 2018 ratio was under 40%, raising slowly from 2008 (18%) to 39,26% (2017) and 34,84 (2018) and then it accelerated: 43% in 2019, 54% in 2020, too fast in my opinion.
So in 2020 total US market capitalization was over 50% of world GDP, when United States' share of global gross domestic product (GDP) was like 16%.
With projected world GDP for 2021 as 6% rise and US market evaluation on March 31st 2021 is stopped rising (55%), but that's pure guessing.

I took [Total Market Capitalization of Public U.S. Companies](https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/) and 
[nominal Global GDP](https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/) plus get 2018-2020 Gross World Product elsewhere and 2021 predictions."
2021-05-16 08:49:14,stocks,"To think beyond the rational, requires the irrational.

To have an irrational person convince the rational, wouldn't be really rational. Naysayers are convinced of their calculations right up until the moment their reality is switched upside down. üòÅ

Extraordinariness wouldn't be extraordinary if it were found amongst the masses, like how value is often decided by it's rarity."
2021-05-16 12:02:08,stocks,">However, there were warning signs prior to the '07/'08 crisis, and a lot of people saw them apart from Michael Burry.

There are warning signs all the time, also during a long bullmarket. Thus, you can only pinpoint warning signs postmortem to an actual market crash.

Also it doesn't help you to know the market will eventually crash. Current market will definitely crash, maybe because of inflation or maybe because of some other event. Maybe next week, maybe next year, maybe in 4 years.

If you are early, you are still wrong."
2021-05-16 05:35:26,stocks,"They did not had records, tehy were over expectations. Easy to go over expectations when these are low?"
2021-05-16 08:58:51,stocks,Lol amc is much higher than it was precovid and they did a massive dillution.
2021-05-16 03:37:26,stocks,Oh sorry I thought this was a discussion and not AMC shilling. Good day.
2021-05-16 09:09:24,stocks,The thing with other countries like Japan is just that they invest in the us stock market instead. Real estate investing also suck in Japan.
2021-05-16 09:13:05,stocks,People should really study japans market more . Been trading sideways since 89.
2021-05-16 13:01:33,stocks,"I think a lot of people missed out on making money and are resentful as a result on these subs. The people who didn't make money off GME, NIO, PLTR, woof coin etc are the ones shoving it down the ""bagholders"" throats preaching about P/E ratios, overvaluation, being too heavy into tech, etc. The same ones who say you should do nothing but put all your money towards SPY or VTF because ""the average investor doesn't beat the S&P"". Fact is if you got in early on any meme stock you would have doubled your money at minimum."
2021-05-16 07:04:40,stocks,"I wouldn't say a 'huge dip"" a correction is usually 10 - 20%. Healthy and nessesary but of course corrections can slide into crashes if the conditions are ripe!"
2021-05-16 07:07:13,stocks,"This is always the arguement, but when the time comes, many will say its still overvalued, and hope it falls more so they can get in cheap. IMO, any opportunity to lower your average should be taken, especially if that opportunity comes from a sell-off."

2021-05-16 16:28:49,stocks,"Your argument is that insanely inflated home values are fine because they can just live there forever or learn their lesson, and people who need homes can just wait?"
2021-05-16 17:48:56,stocks,Fed actually considering it. So your bearish outlook would have to wait. EU been doing negative rates for a while now. Nothing is going to crash in the next few years at least. My take.
2021-05-16 13:33:46,stocks,"This is an oversimplification of what happens.  Some markets are unpredictable and you never really know, but '07/'08 was a ticking time bomb that anyone who cared to look for could have seen.  We're talking a Depression-level financial crisis that was ready to explode.

That perfect storm probably doesn't happen all the time, you're right.  And the average retail investor probably can't predict it.

But again, the FCIC's (government commission appointed to look into the causes) whole thesis rested on the idea that it was predictable, and it could have been prevented.

So I think you're speaking a bit black-and-white, that's all."
2021-05-16 11:53:07,stocks,Only because it became a rollercoaster meme stock for daytraders. I bought at the bottom in March 2020 and got off that ride recently at $13. I feel good about that decision and I'm sleeping better.
2021-05-16 03:39:27,stocks,You misread that. I‚Äôm saying AMC is still not profitable since theaters are still not fully open. Other companies are posting record profits.

2021-05-16 10:56:34,stocks,The savage move was on March 22ish I did 100 MSFT @ 135 and 200 WFC @ 25. Later in the year I bought another 100 WFC averaging down to $24. Got 100 DIS @ 99 as well. Showed up to AAPL & CRM kinda late but those first moves were gold.

2021-05-16 00:00:00,stocks,"How useful is a Bloomberg terminal for an individual investor? I have what is probably a unique situation. I work as a faculty member at a university on the first floor of the business school. Although I‚Äôm not in business or finance, my office is about a few doors down from a few Bloomberg terminals. Recently, they opened up a Bloomberg certification program for free to the faculty. 

I am wondering if this is actually useful training for an individual investor? I don‚Äôt manage too many individual stocks but do have some. Is the information provided worth taking the time to complete the training?"
2021-05-16 00:50:53,stocks,"If you can get free access to a Terminal, by all means learn how to use it. It's not just about researching stocks, it has a metric ton of information about macroeconomics and charts you're not going to find in a brokerage. I've taught myself over the years, and its well worth it if you can get access to that Terminal after the class. It's all up-to-date information that is more accurate than any free source.

It's not going to do you any good if you don't have persistent access to it after the course. You need constant access because the information is always changing. From what I've read, in your situation you have good chances of being able to use it in a lab afterwards."
2021-05-16 00:56:41,stocks,"I'd do it just to learn more about it.  I find it interesting even if not applicable, and it seems like a good opportunity to learn something that most people can't afford to.  If you got the time, why not?"
2021-05-16 02:48:18,stocks,Personally I use it to run linear regressions on the fly and looking into the supply chain of different companies. It can be really helpful to learn more about investing in general and go into depth on different industries and individual companies. If you have access to this for free definitely take advantage of it
2021-05-16 00:02:44,stocks,take it!
2021-05-16 13:35:39,stocks,"every person on my staff has their own, I pay Bloomberg roughly 20k per month and they had to take training on how to use it. there's nothing comes close to it."
2021-05-16 06:58:12,stocks,"If you can use it, it will make research much easier!"
2021-05-16 14:17:24,stocks,"They have one at the 34th street public library in New York City and it‚Äôs almost always available. It gives you great information but, for a retailer investor, you can find whatever you‚Äôre looking for without it through other sources. The terminal does a great job of putting everything together in one place."
2021-05-16 07:12:01,stocks,Do it just for the cool factor and as a cool skill to know. I wish I had access to one
2021-05-16 09:20:22,stocks,"It depends on what you do. I would say it is worth it if you have scaled to that level of success. I have paid a lot of money for fast news, but it comes without the in depth charts of a Bloomberg terminal. That being said it all comes down to budget.

2021-05-16 13:58:40,stocks,"the cert takes about 8 hours and teaches some general knowledge that you may find useful.

all finance students have free access to the cert and the terminal as well. not that much of a unique situation.

it's not just news. you can view financial information, compare multiples with companies in the same industry, do portfolio simulation, view ship routes, hurricanes/fires/earthquakes around the world, view rich people's profile and investments, etc."

2021-05-16 05:43:08,stocks,Everybody talking about Bloomberg terminal likes it's a money making machine do you even basic math?
2021-05-16 04:40:33,stocks,"In my eyes it‚Äôs useless today maybe back in the 80s and 90s it was revolutionary. It‚Äôs just slightly faster public information.

2021-05-15 23:29:53,stocks,"It's never a bad idea to learn a new skill.

2021-05-16 11:18:44,stocks,"Unless you have a gigantic portfolio, it won't be useful enough to justify the cost of a subscription, but if you can access it for free, it's certainly worth your time to learn how to use it.  Heck, even if you don't end up using it to actively guide your day-to-day trades, it's still a fascinating resource and a cool piece of software that can be really fun to just play around with if you're inclined to that sort of thing.  I'd say go for the training.  You might just find that you really don't have that much use for all the information Bloomberg can give you under your current investment strategy, but at least you'll know what's out there if you decide to up your game."

In the bigger picture of ""is it actually useful training for an individual investor"" that depends on what/how you make your decisions on stocks today. 

All and all, it's free education and not overly time intensive. Learn it now, and decide if you want to learn more later. There are plenty of people in this subreddit, that would kill for free access to Bloomberg :)"

however, bloomberg will give it to you instantly. for example, let's say spy suddenly started moving in a huge uptrend. obviously, there's news. you google if and look through multiple media sources and then finally you discover that cdc is removing face masks requirements. in bloomberg, you would find it in a second. also, if you're looking through multiple companies, you don't want to calculate statistics regarding their financials. bloomberg has everything in a nice tidy package for you. it's incredibly expensive but if you're managing millions of assets, it's very helpful"

Usually, a valuation of the spinoff precedes the division. That value is deducted from the parent issue, and then they begin separate paths.

Bought V in 2013 and kept adding on the way down last year in March & April. Will be holding it forever now that it's a multibagger. Fortress balance sheet, tons of free cash flow, low debt, innovative, adopts new tech, high barrier of entry for new entrants,  and gaining entry into new  markets. Even back then, the PE was always in the low 30s.  I've been owning other companies in the financial space which I believe have long term term potential and will be holding forever as they are a very long way off my cost basis...I don't even look at the market moves they make anymore: Master Card, American Express,  JP Morgan Chase, Square & Paypal."

Online purchasing will only increase, especially due to the culture change of the pandemic.  
Inflation will keep raising prices, and V/MA/Etc. will automatically be eating that cake.  
Diversification in FinTech is a relatively good idea.  V is a member of the Dow Jones, so it will grow much slower than it's smaller competitors. Just look at the overall returns from day 1 for MA and V. MA is smaller, and it has much better historical returns than V.

My question is what is she supposed to do? Growth stocks as a whole have been taking a hit. The ARK Funds are described on their website as ‚ÄúETFs focused on disruptive innovation‚Äù. This alone says ARK is bit of a risk and will focus on companies replacing the status quo. That may take some time. I do believe it will happen though. Take ARKF, for instance, she‚Äôs not going to go and invest in a company that prints out paper checks or manufactures atm cards. Square, Shopify, Zillow are a few of the top holdings. Obviously, each has seen incredible growth. They may taking a hit now but may represent the status quo in the future.

Also, other fintech etfs have suffered the same fate recently. Others may not have fallen so far but that seems to be because they weren‚Äôt as successful during the big run up late last year

I'm a novice investor and I‚Äôm genuinely curious as to what she could have done differently. Is it how certain companies were weighted in the funds? Or did she just choose the wrong companies?"

And considering the fuckery that's going on with the FED, money is a little scared right now.

I'm certainly not going to be selling my ARK funds. The reasons I bought them for haven't changed. Just like I have no plans to sell off my individual stocks in the EV and other growth sectors. In fact, if the downtrend continues, I'll probably add to some positions here in a quick minute (it's just not quite there yet). And I mean sure, certain portions of my Roth look like a dumpster fire right now, but I got 30 years. A little market pull back don't scare me."
2021-05-15 20:02:56,stocks,"The backlash is due to all the hype that surrounded ARK Invest last year. At some point there were T-shirts with pictures of her being sold, which is unusual for a fund manager.

It is not clear that the success of her funds was due to any special ability rather than to good luck and to the choice of theme (disruptive tech). Her team is amateurish by qualifications and the risk management of their funds even more so.

This doesn't mean that she did anything ""wrong"" but merely that the whole thing was overhyped without a rational basis. Merely picking stocks based on a theme does not guarantee sustained overperformance of the market in the long run."

Here's an excerpt from *The Intelligent Investor*:

> So, if a fund beats the market, our intuition tells us to expect it to keep right on outperforming. Unfortunately, in the financial markets, luck is more important than skill. If a manager happens to be in the right corner of the market at just the right time, [they] will look brilliant---but all too often, what was hot suddenly goes cold and the manager's IQ seems to shrivel by 50 points. [...] The market's hottest market sector---in 1999, that was technology---often turns as cold as liquid nitrogen, with blinding speed and utterly no warning. [...] Financial scholars have been studying mutual-fund performance for at least a half century, and they are virtually unanimous on several points:

> [...] 3. the more frequently a fund trades its stocks, the less it tends to earn;

> [...] 5. funds with high past returns are unlikely to remain winners for long.

Open- and closed-end mutual funds are a bit different than the ARK actively-managed ETFs, but the principle is the same: When a fund or sector vastly outperforms, it is unlikely to keep outperforming; and the more it outperforms, the more likely it is to lose what it gained. Because our intuition tells us that past performance is indicative of future performance by implicit extrapolation of a trend, when the inevitable down turn happens, people are disappointed."
2021-05-16 00:15:34,stocks,"What I don't understand is why r/stocks and r/investing takes great delight in continually bringing up ARK and Cathie Wood? If it's doing so bad, shouldn't they focus on good companies?

If they are wanting to warn and criticize the dangerous practices of FOMO and timing the market, shouldn't they instead focus on what the Robinhood crowd is actually going after right now which is a failing movie theatre company, a cryptocurrency named after a meme and a retail chain that sells pre-owned video games?

Justified hates are from investors who focus on fundamental and sensible valuations who have been ridiculed, made fun of last year when ARKK had a massive bull run. Everywhere I went on Reddit last year, it was all about ""growth"", and ""value investing is dead."" Lots of value investors basically kept their mouths shut last year and they only started opening their mouth this year with ""I told you so."" 

Some of the unjustified hates and angers are from new investors who bought ARKK near the peaks or at ATH, expecting the fund will keep generating 80% returns in the next 3 years and they ended up being bag holders for this fund with no prospect of recuperate the 30% losses. Sorry Jose, that's not how investing works. Anything outperforming will eventually revert to the mean.

2021-05-16 10:01:36,stocks,"Active fund management is about taking profit when a stock is overvalued and rotating to less risky assets -- you're essentially paying the management fee for the manager to manage your money by timing the market better than you. She did well during 2020 by selling TSLA/SQ/ROKU for a lot of profit and generating new momentum in stocks like PACB for even more profit. She hasn't done well in 2021 however.

The first issue with ARK is that Cathie knew a correction was coming but did not act on it. She dumped the less bubbly stocks like GOOG for more bubbly ones early during the start of the crash and amplified the losses for her investors which is the opposite of what she should be doing. The second issue is that she then proceeds to sell those bubbly stocks for an even lower price (most prominent example is WKHS). It works if the stocks eventually meet her extremely high price targets, but if they don't, she will keep looking like an idiot.

Other issues I have with her is that she markets her fund as a 5-year hold but rotates in and then completely out of companies within weeks like a clueless chicken without profit ‚Äî just holding would have generated lower trading fees. 

She is also fond of initiating long positions at the worst prices (eg COIN, PATH) and be stuck holding bags. Do I really need to pay the annual fee for somebody to buy high?

Her fund has performed well relative to SPY but considering the risk level and tech focus, you have to compare it with leveraged QQQ instead. Then she looks less impressive.

Being very emotional causes euphoria when their positions increase value and very bad feelings when they decrease in value.

2021-05-15 22:07:34,stocks,">My question is what is she supposed to do?

There's nothing she can do... if she wants to maintain the original goals of her portfolio - Promising high growth investments with currently low earnings.  

ARK was setup perfectly for that market during the pandemic as interest/treasury rates and inflation were super low.  

Now they're not.  High growth stocks with little history/earnings suffer the worst during times like this.  

Are those etfs doomed... absolutely not.  They could do very well in the future (given enough time).  They simply won't have the incredible growth rates seen in '20, and unfortunately have fallen back to Earth as a result.

She's the victim of her own unprecedented success."
2021-05-16 08:01:34,stocks,"She built structural instability into her funds. Her funds own large percentages of small, illiquid companies.  Up to 15% of the entire companies stock in some cases.  Now ignoring Tesla, what happens when people leave the fund? She has to sell to offset these ""outflows"" from her fund. Now she's dumping a huge amount of illiquid float into the market. This will move prices down. Devaluing her fund further. Causing more outflows. It's a negative feedback loop.

The fund was poorly conceived, but had a run of good fortune. She's going to burn some good companies that had good growth prospects."
2021-05-16 06:46:41,stocks,"For me and a few others I know, it was that podcast she did where she revealed her strategy for picking stocks ""letting Jesus take the wheel.""

I immediately withdrew from all ARK funds I was invested in after that on my own moral principles alone. I don't want you randomly picking stocks, getting lucky, and calling it divine intervention.

She got on this podcast and said her investments were always doing terrible until she let god make the choice for her. So in other words she is a terrible investor who all of sudden got crazy attention because she got lucky.

I go back to Buffets coin flipping contest analogy on this one."

Financial concerns: highly correlated tech stocks that have had an amazing year and are now cooling off due to ‚Äú________‚Äù (sector rotation, reopening narrative, bond yields, retail call buying fatigue). Her funds have some big positions in low float small caps that do not trade easily. Her buying or selling of those can affect price action. As her holdings have taken a beating in recent months she‚Äôs tended to sell big names and buy more of the smaller companies. 

The fear, or prediction (depending on your opinion), is that if the tech drawdown continues at some point ARK will have to start selling in their small cap holdings and could crater the prices of those stocks, which will lower ARK prices and lead to more redemptions, more selling, etc."

I see a lot of great companies doing just about as well as ARK, falling into red. If ur investing in ARK, then u trust ark and should invest. Add over time.

If your trading ark, then just missed expectations, move on to try other companies, or learn based on where ARK came from and what is happening now to predict future moves. 

Good luck to all. I tried trading ARK at dip at beginning March this year. The second bump in April I got out. Was not liking the look after it fell end of March from bump in middle of march.

Have a plan, minimize losses, keep profit if possible. Study and be prepared"
2021-05-16 11:26:12,stocks,"Maybe a more behaviouralist take: 

The issue with a lot of her funds is that the growth in many of the companies they have positions in (which are large positions) has been caused by flows into the fund. Fund performs well, ARKK puts more money in ARKK holdings, ARKK holdings go up, other investors invest in those stocks, ARKK performs better - its cyclical. This is known as the momentum phenomenon, and most of growth tech has been seeing a lot of it this year. Unfortunately, in environments like this (inflation as a huge concern - I did a breakdown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartChicksMakeBank/comments/ndqh5a/inflation_is_it_that_bad_why_it_matters_and_what/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) growth tech tends to not perform so well, meaning people take money out of ARKK holdings, ARKK share price falls - **and then people start pulling money out of ARKK.** 

The issue is that a lot of ARKK holders were holders because the fund was doing well. When it stopped doing well, they took the money out. So that same cycle that brought the ETF up on the way up is now pushing it down on the way down... positive feedback loops are bad, kids. 

Oh, also there's [this](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ark-invest-cathie-wood-bill-hwang/ark-invest-ceo-wood-says-hwang-provided-seed-capital-for-first-four-etfs-idUSKBN2CO21I) \- Archegos guy (the one that blew up) provided seed funding for ARKK and three of the other flagship funds. So, that might explain something about the crazy price targets on TSLA and others, given Bill was holding deep OTM calls on those. Not sure that's not gonna end in an SEC hearing tbh."
2021-05-16 11:34:02,stocks,"Okay the reality is that her names are all growth oriented and the days of basically making easy money (2020) are gone for now.

During 2020, you could basically shoot into the dark and hit a target. Now, you actually have to be smart about your picks.

For Cathie Woods, as a rule of running and ETF, you actually are not allowed to hold cash. So because of this, she has to be fully in the market at all times. For obvious reasons, this can be bad if the market takes a downturn.

What's brilliant on her end though, is how she mitigates risk by holding on to low volatility names to essentially ""park"" her money until she feels like she can then move money from those names into more of her conviction names.

This can be explained in the video below - fast forward to 3min mark.

[Cathie Woods CNBC Interview](https://youtu.be/atjQcRXX-NI)

So in summary.
- She needs to be 100% deployed in the market
- markets have taken a real nose dive 
- her names in the long term might prove very fruitful 
- she's actively mitigating risk as best she can
- anyone that has a problem or is shitting on her funds is because they're mad that she's not making money hand over fist like last year"
2021-05-16 11:44:12,stocks,"I think it's two fold. People have been on the gravy train for a year and didn't expect it to end, despite claiming high risk tolerance, most people don't actually have high risk tolerance when it comes to deep red.

Secondly, investors have been, I think justifiably, warry about her claims that her investment strategy is in some way directed by God. I have a small holding in ARKK and while I'm going to wait it out, it certainly doesn't give me confidence to put more money in. I want analytical investing, not I vesting driven by some idiotic sense of divine communication."

All you had to do is look at the top holdings of any of the arks to see what the prices had done during fall/early winter 2020 to realise it wasn't sustainable. From November to the start of Feb I swear everyday I'd check my positions I'd be up another 5% on arkk. That's insanely not sustainable.

2021-05-16 07:35:42,stocks,"Never a big fan of her funds and approach, but I am a big fan of your reply and approach. 

If anything, I'd say if people were convinced a year or two ago they should be contrarian and buy hard now when it's down. These funds are volatile by nature, as they only hold volatile stocks (i might be wrong with ""only"", but mostly at least), so if I were to hold ARK in any way or form I'd make a set rules for when to trim some of the gains and when to add more. 

Funds and etf's can be treated lile individual stocks, and should in my opinion. If you have long term belief why abandon when it's on sale? Buy buy buy. When it's riding high, sell off some for cash when it falls back down. 

Everyone says you can't time the market, and that's well and dandy, but you can see when it gained 80% in a year and when it dropped 30%. With pre-set rules it's a mathematical approach rather than timing. 

ARK is supposed to be a long time hold for anyone, so cost averaging would be the way to go."

I bought knowing I'm holding for at least 5 years and we'll reevaluate later. Then again it's less than 10% of my portfolio. What I did this past week was use my ARK funds as a cash fund and sold a bit to load up on two of the companies within it (Tesla and Teledoc). Either way, I'm not buying high and selling low when I haven't lost any conviction. 

People just need to buy for the right reasons and then stay patient. If you fucked up buying in the first place then do what you have to do to fix your allocations to match your risk tolerance. Other than that, buckle up."

Counterpoint on her team's qualifications, you don't become one of the most successful funds or investors by thinking like the rest of the wall street herd. Warren Buffet & Peter Lynch didn't become successful by investing just like everyone else. Warren Buffet has even flat out said that it's to his advantage to be located in Nebraska as opposed to New York City where a bunch of fund managers live so that he's not influenced by their group think and using the same information as them to make investing decisions.

2021-05-15 20:27:01,stocks,"All true, she's just doing what she always does. Anyone who googled or simply followed reddit could see her less then stellar track record.



She creates a high risk ETF and loads up on farfateched possible 10-100 baggers. Usually she gets lucky short term, generate great profits and hype. Eventually her luck turns, she makes riskier bets and starts losing big. At this point she exists....and starts a new ETF with new focus/stocks, same model. If its a success she stays until she starts going red, then she bails and starts over...leaving her former investors to hold the bags."

I threw a bunch of shade around saying they didn't know what they were talking about dissing every stock that later took a hit during the chip shortage.

2021-05-16 05:38:30,stocks,"Of course shorts are targeting her stocks, since her stocks are mostly highly overvalued speculative growth stocks while there is a switch to value stocks occuring. 

The amount of money that has been poured into stocks with barely any revenue or not even a proven products yet is insane. Look at DASH (one of ARK's picks) having barely 1B in revenue being valued at almost 50B... That's insane, even for a high-growth stock.

With inflation fears rising the first stocks to get hit by shorts are exactly those that went sky-high in that speculative frenzy (which we are still experiencing to some degree)."

2021-05-16 11:07:08,stocks,"I‚Äôll counter by saying that their initial price target was absolutely moronic too, until they exceeded it. So I‚Äôd be hesitant to act like it‚Äôs ‚Äúabsolutely moronic.‚Äù It‚Äôs okay to disagree and think it‚Äôs unrealistic, but acting like it‚Äôs legitimately impossible is surreal considering they‚Äôve literally met similarly superlative price targets literally within the past year. 

Overall, ARK publishes a lot of material regarding their projections with TSLA and autonomous driving/EV/AI. 

TSLA could literally be THE autonomous car company. They could make every single autonomous driving vehicle on the market and be the only legitimate player in the game since they get an order of magnitude more driving data than everybody else - and ARK has stated many times that autonomous driving is just AI and AI is based on the data that you have. That adds an immense amount to its valuation targets by 1) selling more cars 2) being able to charge subscriptions for autonomous driving 3) being able to run the taxi/food delivery/transportation game. Imagine the entire cost of the trucking industry, and TSLA replacing that. Imagine the entire cost of the mobile food delivery and taxi industries and TSLA replacing that.

More down to earth, ARK just forecasts that EVs will cost less than ICE vehicles within the next few years, resulting in a complete migration of buyers from ICE to EV, which will skyrocket TSLA sales rather than result in incremental increases. That‚Äôs part of the valuation too.

Then you get into TSLA‚Äôs solar panel aspects, and it‚Äôs ability to basically raise as much capital as it could ever want given it‚Äôs current valuation. Then add into the inability and lack of innovation of traditional manufacturers and TSLA‚Äôs valuation makes more sense. 

I personally disagree with ARK and agree that TSLA is probably overvalued and will not meet the price targets set over the next few years, but I‚Äôm not going to act like it‚Äôs impossible because 1) they‚Äôve already accomplished similar things literally as recent as this year by meeting a price target literally nobody thought was possible for them a few years ago and 2) ARK has been pretty clear about what they expect to happen for TSLA to meet the price target and it‚Äôs not ‚Äúlanding on Mars‚Äù it‚Äôs more stuff that it already dominates in like the EV market, autonomous, solar, etc."
2021-05-16 09:48:59,stocks,"Ah yes redditor who knows more than woman who‚Äôs proven herself repeatedly and was in fact right about the price target, now claiming she is idiot or liar because the market has corrections. I am sure your portfolio is definitely beating the S&P"

2021-05-16 13:00:28,stocks,Ur SO right about Tesla! But I made the error in selling too early cos of the continued losses. But it kept getting pumped up. It‚Äôs unreal valuation IMO. BUT MY OPINION DOES‚ÄôNT MATTER. CATHIE N ELON‚Äôs opinion or SALES PITCH DOES!

2021-05-15 20:14:26,stocks,"It's been openly criticized by a number of people, you can find discussions of that if you google it. In general an active investment fund has a risk management team which uses pretty sophisticated mathematical models to evaluate and limit risk, but her team has no one dedicated to that.

2021-05-16 03:49:08,stocks,"It shouldn't be surprising given how concentrated she has been on speculative stocks. What does surprise me is how many people somehow thought that old-fashioned fundamentals suddenly ceased to matter.

2021-05-16 08:22:46,stocks,Yep. What they did with Workhorse and Fastly recently was ridiculous. Either they've done their research on these stocks or they haven't.

TSLA alone accounts for 11% of ARKK.  Every car company trashed TSLA when it first came out; now every car company has to go electric to stay competitive.  

The stock market is like a fashion show.  A handful of powerful money managers decide where the money flows, and then the media and retail investors fall in-line.    

Fundamentals of a company have nothing to do with stock price.  Amazon was unprofitable for its first 20 years.  Tell me which airline is profitable right now but the ‚Äúreopening trade‚Äù pumped up their stocks.   Oh right...but we are paying for what they are going to earn in the future."

How much more growth do you think there will be? I didn't price target these stocks, TSLA is monster overvalued compared to some of these stocks. Even if it made $3000 price target, that is further into speculation territory that is absolutely asinine. The price would only make it that high by popularity alone. Or like u/kenyard said earlier make 10% over 15 years to get to that price.

2021-05-15 23:08:38,stocks,"Stocks are clearly more expensive than they have been in a long time, but be careful in how you determine P/E here. The last year has been anomalous for markets in many ways. For instance, earnings of the components in SMH are likely to have been hurt less during COVID isolation than the S&P at large, which contains a multitude of businesses that depend on people not staying at home. 

To ""filter away"" or ""smooth out"" the anomalous year, try looking at the [Shiller 10-year P/E ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe). Using that, the S&P P/E is about 37, which is still quite high historically."

Second, you can invest in multi factor funds that have much lower P/E ratios.

2021-05-16 00:00:00,stocks,"Discussing the risks associated with stocks One thing that I think isnt talked about enough on this sub is risk.  I see a lot of posts and comments from people upset about their investment/trading choices not working out, and I think a lot of that comes from a lack of acknowledgement of the risks associated with stocks.  It often times seems as though people interpret 'high risk/high reward' as 'most likely high reward with maybe a small short term downside'.

This post isnt meant endorse a bear or a bull case in general - make your own decisions based on your research.  This post is more to encourage people to try to better understand the downside possibilities of different positions.

For starters, an all stock portfolio, even one where you're only invested in passive tracking funds, has historically been considered pretty high risk.  SPY was around $150 in 2000, and touched the $80s in 2002 and 2008.  This represents more than a 40% loss for someone who didnt dca into it during that period.  People starting out this year should acknowledge that sort of thing could possibly happen over the next 8 years, even if you don't think it will.  

Individual stocks, even the safe, mature dividend stocks, can fluctuate greatly depending on market conditions.  Competition pops up, costs increase, demand shifts, technology changes.  Nothing is 100% safe from a large drop given a bad turn of events.  Highly speculative stocks without earnings are even more sensitive and susceptible to large drops as we've seen recently.  Maybe these stocks continue to grow in anticipation of big future earnings, but they've also got the potential to lose most of their value if the market conditions turn against them.

Before I buy a stock, I go through the history and outlook for that company and also for that industry.  I take special note of downturns and acknowledge what I think is a reasonable downside for that particular stock.  Acknowledging and accepting those risks help me stay away from trades that are higher risk than I actually want, and helps me keep my conviction when my choices are struggling.

If you're new to investing and trading, make sure you give enough thought to how far the stock or etf you're researching could fall, and make a reasonable decision on if that fits with your appetite for risk."
2021-05-16 11:50:35,stocks,"Jesus, yes, thank you. And no, you can't just ""hold through it"" - no guarantee its coming back up, and even if it does, the time period during which you were underperforming is going to take much longer to recover from than you'd think.  

Two things to add: 

1. ***Diversification***: If you're all in on growth tech, you had a really bad time these last few months. If you had a reasonably built portfolio, not so much, a few of your holdings may have seen a bit of pain but that's about it, others would have done well to compensate. **If you're building a portfolio look at commodities, bonds, REITs, and diversify across geographies and sectors for christsake.** 
2. ***Volatility***: There's risk and there's volatility. They are not the same. If you hold a stock like PLTR which has a monthly standard deviation of about 10%, don't be surprised when it goes up or down 10% in a month. That's normal and expected. It's still something to consider, but you should be prepared for it because it happens all the time. That is a wildly different situation from the risk that eg., the Chinese government starts taking regulation seriously all of a sudden, cancels your subsidiary's IPO, forces you to reclassify them and pay fines out the nose, and so on, causing the stock to fall 40% (looking at BABA). This is neither normal nor expected mathematically speaking, but definitely something you should think about as a source of risk. 

There's risk and there's *risk* and responsible investing is actually protecting against both of them."

So applying historical statistics to current companies and their values. For examples if 9/10 startups do not make money past year one. Thats a stat you can use in calculating probability of success. 10%. Which would mean that startups would require 10 different companies to be invested as only one would not loose your money and then compensate for the others losses. A vaccum example but hopefully you get the point.

Could someone help me understand what the difference is when buying shares from e.g. NDQ vs FRA in regards to W8? Disclaimer; I know what a W8 is and why you should care as a non USA investor.

I was looking at Hasbro shares. I could buy in USD from NDQ, or buy using EUR from FRA.  
On Degiro, selecting NDQ the Pricing Data panel shows the share is W8-form applicable.  
When I select the same share from FRA it doesn't have this mention.

2021-05-15 21:05:09,stocks,"Does it really matter if you count sales to a dealership or sales to consumers?

Either way VW is going to have to cannibalize their profitable ICE sales overtime.

Since VW is already the #2 automaker in the world it's not like it's going to be easy for them to grow 20%+ in a year like it is for a smaller company like Tesla & Nio. Hence my point of why VW isn't the best investment right now despite what EV numbers they might post. When a company like Tesla or Nio posts big growth numbers in EV sales you know they're selling more vehicles then they were last year. When a VW or GM posts big EV numbers you don't really know if they're selling more vehicles then they were before or not without looking at their ICE sales."
2021-05-16 08:07:15,stocks,"It's complicated.

Revenue numbers include sold to a dealer, leases, employee leases, leased cars sold to third parties such as car max

Quarterly sales numbers are made up of lease cars, and the data provided by dealers and other third parties.

Production schedules are pretty much solely based on what the dealers are willing to buy. 

If you look at the quarterly US sales reports they're pretty misleading from the very high volume of employee leases that regularly get rotated around, and the company can push certain sales figures up by choosing which cars go on the lease program."
2021-05-15 21:15:55,stocks,"If you're talking about a startup company that's growing a lot (like Tesla or Nio) they can still grow in a stagnant market like you describe. Tesla still is overall in Europe. 

But when you're already the size of VW (who I should note is an even bigger in Europe due to European's loyalty to European automakers) the growth prospects are definitely going to be really limited. The only way VW can see significant growth in the shift to EVs is if other automakers fail to transition and VW can snatch up some of their market share.

On the one hand for VW it would be great for them if say BMW failed and VW could snatch up a bunch of their market share. But on the other hand, if a bunch of ICE automakers fail to make the transition to EV's and go out of business, chances are VW themselves will be running into a lot of the same transition issues that hurt their competitors."
2021-05-15 23:00:31,stocks,"Volkswagen is becoming a technology company that happens to produce ""mobility devices.""

Their skateboards are being used by other auto makers.  They're going all-in on bidirectional charging.  They're embracing lidar in their push for autonomous vehicles."
2021-05-16 18:20:02,stocks,For sure. What might trip them up is if they don‚Äôt focus on user experience. When the ram got a 14 inch screen they were really bragging about it. When Tesla‚Äôs already had MASSIVE screens and people had been dropping tablets in dashes for years.

Legacy automakers have nowhere near the level of vertical integration and production efficiency that Tesla has. Fully transitioning to EVs will make them unprofitable for many years, which is why their valuations seem cheap.

Add to that the fact that they have to invest hundreds of billions to become less profitable and you can see why legacy automakers are in big trouble."

I think you forgot that VW has direct competition models from Skoda which happens to be owned by VW. And Audi have models which are in direct competition with VW Golf for example. But it's owned by VW too. All of them will use the same platform, already using.

Just check the video from the event. German flavored keynote type of event. Quite funny but informative."
2021-05-16 13:31:02,stocks,"Wow, so if say that cannibalised a sale of a VW Golf for instance. I don't know their gross margin there but let's guess 20% margin. I don't live in the US but I expect it to cost around $30k. 

That's 6k profit. 

So selling an ID4 actually cost them $9k? Adding opportunity cost to the mix."
2021-05-15 22:16:45,stocks,"Uh... it's relevant to base projections on the number of cars sold in total without relevance to the inner workings of the engine. Unless you think the number of cars owned by households will decrease or something or people will stop driving in general.

Which is possible if we're talking about self-driving cars, but  we aren't, and in the case of absolute full autonomic driving the vast majority of people would not purchase cars. So outside of this tangent, the number of cars on the road is what matters."

2021-05-16 16:24:47,stocks,"Yep, that's correct. Like I said, legacy automakers are in huge trouble. Especially because their executives and shareholders are a lot more short term focused than Tesla's and even the average investor.

Essentially VW is investing $200B to become much less profitable if not unprofitable in the short term, just to survive in the long term. It's gonna be tough to get through. That said it's still much better than just sticking your head in the sand like Toyota and BWM to name a few."

2021-05-16 02:36:35,stocks,"MSFT is the only one of those that has really stayed entirely in their domain - in no small part because they were already the oldest and biggest. Acquisitions like Github and LinkedIn were a departure for them - and we don't know where those will go - but they're already so big that they won't impact growth in a significant way. Apple went from making Macs to being the dominant player in a space that didn't exist when they started - mobile. There's no way anyone could have known in the iMac days that things would play out that way. Same for Google - it was a search engine and maybe sold some ads and now it's in a whole shit ton of stuff, not the least of which is - again, mobile. But if you looked at that in 2000 when the mobile market didn't even really exist, you'd have no frame of reference for that. There's going to be more major innovation shifts in the next 20 years (driverless, AI, AR, etc., etc.) and some other company(s) are going to hit these levels because they did it right. Do you know who those companies are right now? Without even knowing what the innovations are?"

2021-05-16 14:21:57,stocks,"6/14 - 46 million shares - about 10% of current float. 

My hypothesis would be that a lot of insiders may hold until the stock gets closer to $15 to $20 (or even back to the IPO price of $24). Selling at $10 would correlate to a market cap /valuation lower than the private valuations in 2017 / 2018. If an insider needs the money, they need the money. But as the e-commerce sector has been hit pretty hard since the February peak - it sure seems like it would make more sense to wait for an industry rotation for things to be a bit more bullish and at least closer to the $15+ price point that WISH was at a couple weeks ago. To be fair, as the ATL brought significantly more volume and attention to the stock - it is possible that WISH gets back there by that lock up expiration. At which point, for long-term investors - it might make sense to consider selling and getting back in a few days after. I still think it gets to $20+ again by year-end and at this price point - is a realistic 2x play."

2021-05-16 14:26:39,stocks,There are more than 18 million App Store reviews between Apple and Android. Makes the 4.6 star reviews even more impressive! Some people want the best possible products but that is not what you get at a dollar store or even a Walmart. These stores target budget conscious and value-led consumers.

Been a lot of fun looking into the fundamentals of the companies mentioned. I like a lot of the suggestions that where mentioned. Someone mentioned buying some of her favorite companies and I like your idea too. I'm going to do some more research on companies that we both loved.

Here‚Äôs what I like about the firm‚Ä¶1) have been attracting attention from quality VCs and Silicon Valley in general for a while now, and it seems like those that get to see under the hood really like what they see, 2) big opportunity to shift their business into more commercial, non-government, applications (in some ways it feels like almost ground floor in the commercial arena), 3) government work has been sticky over time and while that may be in part due to the slowness to change in the public sector, I like to think it‚Äôs that they like what they are getting (and they keep allocating more contracts to PLTR), 4) they are keyed in on a trend (big data) that isn‚Äôt going away and it‚Äôs only getting more important ‚Äî honestly, I have no idea if PLTR is the best way to play this trend, or if they will be a ‚Äúwinner‚Äù in it, but from what I‚Äôve read I like their chances and I want to hitch myself to them."

(Since IPO, however, FB has had a ~750% return, but I didn't think this was a fair comparison since share prices tend to be a little inflated at IPO)

2) you can find apps of professional quality that will let you watch everything and anything for free. Even Facebook has a number of sights. If that isn't your thing there are also pirate sights that for a few bucks per month will give you hundreds of channels. 

Even more important,, the incredible increase in prices, 2x4's used o be $1.50 now there almost $8.00, a sheet of 4x8 plywood was $15.00, now it's $60.00, but wages haven't kept pace. Wall Street Journal just had an article on how ALL food prices are going up, AGAIN. And house prices are insane.

2021-05-15 23:10:06,stocks,Why is SQ and TSLA so cheap on a price to sales level.  Is WS valuing SQ as a bank vs fin tech and TSLA as a car company vs tech?
2021-05-16 10:31:59,stocks,SQ I think is valued the same as PayPal. PayPal‚Äôs PS is 12 so SQ is a bit cheaper in that aspect. But either one is a great buy rn. Fintech is going to lead the way in the next decade.
2021-05-16 01:40:05,stocks,"Yes; that can all happened and mostly likely will.  It just that the easy money has been made on SQ and it‚Äôs a rougher road for them to grow larger.   How much do you think they can grow?  At 150B; it‚Äôs almost worth as much as Goldman Sachs.  At 200B; you are looking at Wells Fargo.  

By no means do I think they are bad company.  Just the stock is ran away from itself; like a lot of recent plays.  I feel the stock priced in for the next 5 years.  I can get out and come back in a few years and won‚Äôt miss a beat."
2021-05-16 01:46:21,stocks,It can trade sideways for sometime... I could see paypal and square doing that a for a bit or maybe even going down this year who knows... but over the course of the next 10 years I think fin tech will continue to eat the big banks lunch. Maybe I‚Äôm too optimistic on square but I think they can reach 500 B in 10 years on the low end and maybe if everything falls right they hit 1T.. they are in huge markets which makes it easier for them to thrive. The e-commerce‚Äôs market and digital payments are the places to be in the next 10 years as those will continue to grow exponentially.
2021-05-16 02:06:00,stocks,"Sideways is the most likely scenario for the short term.  At 500B; it‚Äôs the same as JPM, the biggest and most profitable bank.  Can be but it is a hard goal.  I‚Äôd like to see SQ get added to some indexes first.  SP500 or 600 would give it a nice floor."

The reason the ticket was only being trading through a few brokerages was because it was facing delisting due to Trump's previous executive order. LKCO has since won the court case so I will be finally transferring my portfolio over to TD.

2021-05-16 03:32:14,stocks,It was obviously a bad decision. I did not buy it as a short term buy. My entry price was 45$ and the last few weeks have been brutal on my whole portfolio where seemingly no bottom was in sight. I don't have too much cash left to average down so I decided to sell it for now and get back in once the situation is calmer at a lower price maybe 20-25$. But I am not sure now after that news that we will ever reach that.
2021-05-16 08:54:01,stocks,"I assume these are adult students who can drive? Regardless, Nio is a luxury brand that is being marketed as such. Im not concerned that young (most likely poor) students dont know about Nio too much yet. Its a new car company geared towards wealthy ppl.

I would definitely try to by back in while it‚Äôs roughly around the same price to minimize your losses on this provided you don‚Äôt get into a wash sale or anything. Best of luck regardless"
2021-05-15 20:44:56,stocks,If you think the entrenched fossil fuel players will let 100% EV happen by 2030 I have some kelp diesel to sell you.
2021-05-15 21:56:04,stocks,"Do you think China, California or Norway give a fuck? There will still be plenty of gas cars to sell to, but by then EVs will be incredibly economical and political pressures will be insurmountable. The urgency between 2030 and 2020 will 3 fold 2020 and 2010.


Not to mention any country not making massive investments in EV infrastructure will be left WAY behind by 2040. Even the Saudis are smart enough to IPO Aramco and invest in alternative energy.

2021-05-15 20:39:11,stocks,"It's up to the company how they deal out dividends, if at all. Assuming the amount of net earnings available to the common stock after quarterlies is roughly the same or increasing, and company outlook isn't in doubt, a company paying $2.24/yr will probably continue to do so. If MSFT sells at $224, then the yield is 1%. If it got cut in half and the dividend rate was the same, then the yield would go up to 2%. In that way, sustainable dividends act as a sustaining force for the market value of the common, because even if public sentiment goes sour for some reason on a company, if they continue to rake in profits, then sell offs on emotion and sentiment establish bargains for the cold and calculated investor that can capitalize on increasing yield as price goes down."

2021-05-15 23:35:10,stocks,Your 1st paragraph is absolutely not true.
2021-05-16 02:17:46,stocks,"I have read in many places that even in a single stock, if a share us purchased at the each low, and sold at each high there after, only working Long positions (buy low sell high) buying dips and selling highs, you'll make more than if you held at the start of an upward run, ignored the dips, and sold at the top.

Properly managing your investment is worth more than buy, and hold.

Lets use the last 2 days of AAPL as an example.

Passive investor buys AAPL at its low point at 04:00 on May 13 at 121.68 and sold it at AH close high point on May 14 at 127.80.  

Net profit: $6.12.

An active investor or management firm buys at same starting point at 121.68.  Sells at 126.13, rebuys at 124.32, sells at 125.79, buys AH of May 13 at 124.52, sells at morning open on the 14th at 127.12, rebuys at morning dip at 126.00, and sells again end of day 127.80.

Net profit gleaned: $10.32.

There were several other opportunities to have bought and sold on these 2 days but I thought id keep it simple to someone watching and just making a few trades.

Difference is 63.2911% more profit though active trading versus passive buy and hold for the same period of time.

If trading 50 shares of AAPL, the difference in take home profit to the investor is $200 - $316 profit passive, or $516 Active.  I know what I want to put in my bank account.  More, not less."
2021-05-16 10:49:13,stocks,"I don‚Äôt think you understand what passive investing is. This example doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Passive investors wouldn‚Äôt buy a single stock, much less hold it for 1 day. Passive investing means buying index products to get the benefits of dca and diversification, and holding over a long timeline. Your example would both be considered active, except the first is to buy into a position and sell one day later, and the other is some hypothetical scenario where one could accurately call the tops and bottoms and trade in and out of the position over the same timeframe.  

You also have the benefit of hindsight in your example. 

This recent explosion in retail investing really does show a crazy level of ignorance. No offense, but if you don‚Äôt even understand what passive investing is, you shouldn‚Äôt really opine on it."
2021-05-16 11:33:03,stocks,"The OP asked he should just hunker down and wait.  I replied that instead of passively siting there, he should consider actively trading, it makes more money if well managed, and provided a basic scenario that mathematically shows it does to retort your suggestion that it doesn't.

Sorry, I don't see a need to continue conversation with you if your only response is that I must be new and therefore ignorant and stupid, then I wish you good luck with your investments.  The fact that you argue that an actively managed portfolio earns less than a passively managed one tells me: kettle, black.

2021-05-16 10:51:07,stocks,"My take:

WISH is often misunderstood as a company. There is negative sentiment in some online circles but also strong reasons to invest; let me make the bullish and bearish cases:

Bullish:

The company is on track to do more than $3 Billion in revenue this year; it is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world. Alibaba and Amazon were both intrigued enough to consider acquisitions. The private valuation a in 2017 was more than $8.5 Billion - this was before the pandemic was ever a thing. 

The company focuses on mobile-based app sales via discovery versus search - which is why their website has never been a focus. The average rating across Apple and Amazon is 4.6 stars with more than 18 million reviews. The app has been one of the Top 3 most downloaded apps globally each year since at least 2017. There are more than 100 million monthly active users. The business is broken up into three main categories - core marketplace, ads and logistics.  Core marketplace is where they match buyers to sellers (and what they are most commonly known for) - but the growth in the other two categories has been phenomenal. As part of their logistics solution - they also have something called Wish Local - which can improve shipping times (allowing local pick-up options, significantly). They have more than half a million active merchants on the platform and delist those who provide poor quality products. Their average shipping time continues to go down and they are investing heavily in improving their weaknesses (bad merchants and slow shipping). In their last earnings call, management mentioned that they expect to be a stronger reopening play than pandemic play because the WISH user base is geared towards the population most impacted by the pandemic (lower income). Comparable companies like JMIA, POSH, ETSY, BABA etc. have all been beaten down since the February high and the ‚Äúlaw of averages‚Äù would indicate that it is only a matter of time before investors jump back into e-commerce because of the current cheap stock prices. 

Bearish:

Slow shipping, poor quality products, lack of good search functionality and disappointing website. Amazon and Alibaba are strong competitors to go against. Wish‚Äôs focus on lower income customers provides a lower ceiling of opportunity. E-commerce is done and not needed once the pandemic is over. 

In my opinion, the bearish case discounts the far higher amount of positive experiences (than the louder, negative ones). The focus is on their core market revenue without understanding their logistics business or advertising business and the stronger opportunity there. I believe, as people have become more comfortable buying things online - that will continue to be the wave of the future and e-commerce will only continue to grow. Wish has strong market share in countries around the world and more than 50% of revenue comes from underserved countries other than the US. (It is growing rapidly in India, Africa, Europe and they‚Äôre targeting South America too.) 

The company has been around since 2010 - continues to show growth and is very invested in new user acquisition and driving higher spending per user (and pivoting towards focusing on better quality customers too).

They‚Äôre based in the US (San Francisco) - and have an ex-Googler as their CEO. They just hired an executive chair for their board that helped build Square and Alibaba. They have $1.8 Billion in cash. 

Not financial advice (lol) - but this company isn‚Äôt a penny stock. Combining their opportunity with a sector rotation back into e-commerce (which will naturally happen soon enough) - and you have a solid case for 2x from the current stock price this year on the low-end and potentially much higher! There is a reason why 17 hedge funds bought Wish on Friday and 12 added to their positions (versus 2 closing positions). 

Good luck!"

2021-05-16 01:49:20,stocks,"Natural gas and carbon capture. 

I hold exxon because it fits my risk right now, but that being said, chevron is a better better play because of their toyota deal. They provide infrastructure for hydrogen and make an effort on creating green hydrogen using natural gas for their (toyotas) fuel cells. 

I do believe exxon has the short/medium term though when it comes to share price appreciation and risk/reward. Exxon is a strong play right now because of the brent crude holding upper $60s. they have cheap debt and have defended their dividend. It's worth the share price. Exxon will be above 70 by the end of the year, but Chevron is also a fantastic buy and is a better LONG. 

Exxon also has many moat related benefits when it comes to natural gas. Carbon capture is probably going to be a stepping stone in the long process of the energy transition as well. People forget the coal to oil transition took 100 years and countries still use coal as well. 

Oil is used in plastics. It ain't going anywhere in the next decade. 

I'm also quite excited to see what role large oil companies will play in green hydrogen, as I said earlier, chevron wants to create infrastructure to support hydrogen use. I think oil companies will do well with this since exxon and chevron both have the baseline infrastructure to support green hydrogen, as fuel cell cars do need to be pumped with hydrogen. I think this is years away, but I don't think exxon is screwed as much as people think. They just realize that oil is not a thing of the past yet, and are not willing to risk their share price by dabbling in speculative green alternatives. After all, that is standard oil."

Exxon will be above 70 by the end of the year, but Chevron is also a fantastic buy and is a better LONG.

>Exxon also has many moat related benefits when it comes to natural gas. Carbon capture is probably going to be a stepping stone in the long process of the energy transition as well. People forget the coal to oil transition took 100 years and countries still use coal as well.

>Oil is used in plastics. It ain't going anywhere in the next decade.

>I'm also quite excited to see what role large oil companies will play in green hydrogen, as I said earlier, chevron wants to create infrastructure to support hydrogen use. I think oil companies will do well with this since exxon and chevron both have the baseline infrastructure to support green hydrogen, as fuel cell cars do need to be pumped with hydrogen. I think this is years away, but I don't think exxon is screwed as much as people think. They just realize that oil is not a thing of the past yet, and are not willing to risk their share price by dabbling in speculative green alternatives. After all, that is standard oil.

It's not any opinion, the stock is flat over 15 years. 20 accounting inflation. I don't consider myself a market timer or trader and I don't buy into people being able to do it consistently (data supports that, 90% fail to beat the S&P). 

Carbon capture is an expense for the next 10 years. And it's something that every company that owns refineries or power plants is already working on themselves or thru other parties. 

Natural gas is going to be challenged by electrification as well, it is already being challenged as a power source on the economics alone (not considering the continued and increasing pressure it will face in a social way, from governments, etc)

Hydrogen isn't going to be that big of a market because it's far behind electrification. It could have a sizeable role in difficult to electrify areas, but that's not where most of the business is. But even that market is a decade away, maybe more. And also, there's a lot of competition, that also have infrastructure, already making hydrogen, or have infrastructure Exxon doesn't have much of (like pipeline networks)

Coal is still being used. How good are coal stocks returns the last decade? Continued use =/= the return will be ok. 

BP/Shell/Total are way ahead of Exxon and Chevron. ""green speculatives""? How are wind, solar, EVs speculative? It's huge business, solid returns, improving efficiencies, improving technology, gaining market share every single year."
2021-05-16 10:24:14,stocks,"Hydrogen is probably 20 years or so away. I bought APD long for this reason. I'd buy into EV things but they are priced 10 years ahead and are getting slaughtered now. I'll buy into when they're green. I made my money on lithium last year and have no interest in buying back right now. 

Shell or bp is a better play than exxon for that exposure. But the main reason I like exxon now is because it's NOT a green energy play, especially when oil is going up in value. Dividend is also secure and debt is being payed down fast. I like their leverage.

 When referencing those things I mainly was talking of chevron, which is making it known that they are experimenting with that route."
2021-05-16 01:24:12,stocks,"The interest rates are low because the government is $30T in debt, if interest goes up the music stops and everything falls to pieces. The incentive to raise interest rates would be to incentivize saving over borrowing but despite inflated asset values holistically the economy is still struggling, particularly on a global scale. In 2008 they turned of the money printer too soon and the recession ended up far more pronounced than necessary so this time they seem to be erring on the side of over printing. 

Some analysts from the Austrian camp like Peter Schiff are declaring it the end of fiat and saying the whole thing will come crashing down in hyper inflation but it seems doubtful. Bonds are still selling and people are still holding dollars. as long as China‚Äôs birthrate is negative and the EU is battling with Brexit it‚Äôs difficult to imagine another reserve currency emerging, so the only reasonable outcome is a digestion in time of higher valuations before we return to course"

2021-05-16 09:43:01,stocks,Some people only buy 1 or 2 shares at a time to keep their averages down low.  They don't spend all of their money buying 100 or 1000 shares.

2021-05-15 20:12:30,stocks,"> The seed of the problem was government forcing banks to give mortgages to people who couldn't afford them. 

You haven't said why this is incorrect. If the government didn't force banks to give mortgages to people who would likely default, then how would we have had the housing crisis?"
2021-05-16 11:12:12,stocks,"Look at housing afterwards.  Prices still going through the roof, just like before 2008.  Is the government still forcing banks to give mortgages to people with bad credit?  Or are institutions inflating the hell out of these assets, just to chase more profits?"
2021-05-16 13:01:05,stocks,"> Look at housing afterwards. 

Yes, prices dropped significantly and took years to recover. And although prices have been going up for the last year, housing is nowhere near as overpriced or more importantly as over-leveraged as they were in 2008. 

In fact, outside of a few of the most popular cities housing is very affordable. I live in a metro area of 4 million+ people and you can get a 2,500 sq ft, 4bd/3 bath house with a nice yard and good schools for $250k, on a 3% fixed 30 year mortgage. That is far from over priced."

2021-05-15 22:26:55,stocks,"Just 50 shares. Not a Whole lot. 

But considering I just wanted to put some of my funds long term safe-ish ETF . This definitely hurt. 

At that point in time, didn't do any research and bought purely based on a friend's recommendation. What I really was looking for was VTI. So this loss is all on me."
2021-05-15 22:36:38,stocks,I keep about 65% or so at the moment in VTI. I regret buying a lot of ARKG and MOON the most. I don‚Äôt see them being positive for the year
2021-05-16 01:05:36,stocks,"At that point in time I even went into ARKF. 

Took the L on that one in March and shifted Whatever was left to VTI. Had the fair share of heat when I did that but turned out to be the right choice. 

MOON was obviously a Fun Money ETF .
Doubled down on its biggest radar holdings and made it out Green on both the stock and the ETF . 

ARKK remains my biggest pain at this point. Might consider taking a L on half of it and keep the rest ."

Haha yah I‚Äôm close with some people in hospital billing and they have a similar spite towards insurance companies. I don‚Äôt want to keep bugging you with questions but I do appreciate you taking the time to answer my relatively naive perspective. CLOV earnings are coming so if I have questions in the future I may try DMing you!
Thanks again very much!"
