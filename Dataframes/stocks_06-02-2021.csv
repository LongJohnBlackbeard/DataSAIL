2021-06-02 19:58:28,stocks,SENS and INO
2021-06-02 19:48:35,stocks,"Cheap? The cheapest by far is Chinese stocks right now. However, It comes with a lot of risk and there is no guarantee they will ever be valued fairly."
2021-06-02 19:57:17,stocks,"Obviously there are things like $BB that have room to run still. But take a look at $UWMC. Profitable company, decently priced, pays dividend and has higher short interest."
2021-06-02 19:36:54,stocks,RIDE and CRSR
2021-06-02 19:51:16,stocks,"ASX around $7.5, SFT has nice upside potential with increased used vehicle demand and explosive growth. WKHS, C3.ai around $55-65, something I’m not allowed to post here is about to become LCID which is a nice catalyst for the stock. ESPR might be the riskiest play as it is heavily shorted and it really depends on next Q results if they bounce back to $30-ish."
2021-06-02 19:32:13,stocks,I am really looking forward to NOK and INO going up later this year.
2021-06-02 19:29:44,stocks,"Etsy is a little over that but undervalued imo, I think it could go back to $200+"

2021-06-02 19:31:10,stocks,High Tide Inc. Just listed on NASDAQ and had a little dip today so could be a good price to get in at.
2021-06-02 19:55:25,stocks,It's probably gonna be MAPS
2021-06-02 19:45:26,stocks,"Could also sell on the news for a bit more. It was the #1 discussed stock over on r/pennystocks for quite a while - like, a couple months - and the Nasdaq listing has been a known quantity for months. I don't think it's been added to any indices, just the exchange, so unclear which direction it will go for now. (That said, it's an excellent long-term play, I'm just quibbling about entry points.)

Full disclosure: I has a position and closed it when it broke out of the recent swing range based on the daily candle and ""sell on the news"" logic."
2021-06-02 19:54:17,stocks,I’m curious as well to see where things go for the next few weeks. Earnings report at the end of the month as well so those are always fun to deal with.
2021-06-02 18:28:16,stocks,none to loan or your account is not set up for shorting.
2021-06-02 19:11:41,stocks,You need a margin account to short. If you have that then your broker just didn't have shares available to lend. I have 4 accounts and when one doesn't have shares another often does.
2021-06-02 19:29:23,stocks,You can always borrow stock. There are two questions here. There are times when the cost of borrowing the stock exceeds the profit potential. Today’s automated broker isn’t designed to do anything out of the repetitive ordinary business. When i had a seat on the CBOE I could always borrow stock. The broker doesn’t do too much work for small customers not paying commissions.
2021-06-02 19:37:31,stocks,"A trailing stop is a sell order, not a buy order. It sounds like you placed a market buy order near the day's high. Google Finance shows it traded at $29.41 shortly after today's open."
2021-06-02 18:22:35,stocks,What ever exchange you use is probably using a spread to charge you fees. This happened to me a few times.
2021-06-02 18:27:08,stocks,"Did this only happen with orders that included a trailing stop?

Try placing the orders without a stop and then adding it after the trade fills."
2021-06-02 18:55:25,stocks,I'm on Webull. They say they don't spread. I'll have to keep testing this out on smaller purchases to figure out what I did wrong.
2021-06-02 18:56:19,stocks,"I figured I would do that if I can't figure out what I did wrong, but maybe smarter investors here know how to get the Webull trailing stop loss order right with fewer steps"
2021-06-02 18:59:11,stocks,"> Webull

there's your problem, right there."
2021-06-02 18:33:39,stocks,"There’s also something to say about not only the gaming market as a whole BUT the shift from console to PC gaming as the more mainstream platform.  
In the past, PC gaming was more niche and for older gamers. That is shifting and PC gaming is rapidly capturing more and more of the console gaming/younger gamers audience."
2021-06-02 18:33:37,stocks,">At $1200+, you would think it’s been around for decades and established itself like an Amazon and Google

shop mcap: 152B

amzn mcap:1.63T

should prob look up what market cap is before discussing a company

that being said, shopify is very overvalued. the problem is, it is an absolute monster of a company and has no competitors"
2021-06-02 18:24:23,stocks,"So I’m a small business owner. Therefore in quite a few small business groups, a majority of the people in those groups use shopify as their selling platform. They even pay “Shopify specialists” to set their sites up. And Shopify is definitely the more expensive selling platform. So they’re making hella money right now."
2021-06-02 18:39:38,stocks,"Yeah that’s on me. I often forget to take market cap into account when I really should be.

Given this extra detail, why do you still think it’s overvalued?

Edit: Good ole toxic Reddit. Gets downvoted for asking a genuine question and not having all the knowledge, hence why I asked it in the first place."
2021-06-02 18:41:38,stocks,"Interesting. And do you use it yourself? If so, do you like the platform? Any reason to leave or do they do a good enough job to keep you?"
2021-06-02 18:55:38,stocks,GE is almost as big as SHOP in market cap
2021-06-02 19:08:33,stocks,"its trading at 50x revenue

that being said, shopify has had unbelievable growth and it's a fantastic company. the stock price is just a bit too high"
2021-06-02 18:58:28,stocks,From my understanding they have way more themes than other platforms and easier integration. Plus better payment options and SEO settings. After comparing them with Wix though I went with Wix. I have a majority of what Shopify users have at like 1/4 of the price. I don’t sell the large volumes other companies do where I need Shopify or can even justify the price.
2021-06-02 19:28:04,stocks,This was very helpful. Thank you!
2021-06-02 19:27:18,stocks,"This is really helpful! So better designed for high volume small businesses. One last question for you if you don’t mind. 

Now although Wix makes more sense for you now, if down the road you start selling more volume to justify Shopify would you make the switch? Or at that point is the convenience of everything setup in Wix not worth it?"
2021-06-02 17:44:02,stocks,Aphria stocks merged into tilray at around .83 a share.
2021-06-02 17:45:20,stocks,ok that makes sense
2021-06-02 19:08:19,stocks,My money shows up within 1second on my etrade account when I transfer it. I'd check your bank account to make sure it transferred...
2021-06-02 17:43:57,stocks,There’s currently a massive demand for free brokers. My broker T212 took a month to deposit my sisters funds into her account. I’d recommend writing an email to the team to change the priority of your issue to urgent
2021-06-02 17:45:55,stocks,I just transferred $ to my Think or Swim this afternoon.  It was there in less than a minute.
2021-06-02 18:11:29,stocks,"I have never had a issue with E-Trade. You say you transferred money but how the F did you transfer it. If by transfer you mean you wrote a check and mailed it then good luck. Or maybe you setup your bank account and did a bank account -> etrade account transfer which will take 14 BUSINESS DAYS. Or maybe you did a money order and then where the F is your money. So as you can see there are a lot of options all with clearly defined dates on E-Trades website. Now unlike Robinhood, E-Trade actually has support so what did they say? They have chat and people you can actually talk to...

In a nutshell : Robinhood will gladly ""loan"" you $50 so they can say they will instantly transfer your money but in reality that money still takes 3-14 business days to get there depending on transfer type.

E-Trade would never front me $30k waiting for the the actual transfer to happen and instead just really on the fact that this is how banking works. Agree or disagree but thats how it is.

&#x200B;

Now... call Etrade and ask them...."
2021-06-02 19:34:00,stocks,Yea it did. Think the best option is to reach out to them from what others have said
2021-06-02 18:10:56,stocks,Will do thanks.
2021-06-02 18:19:39,stocks,"I’ll give a call in the morning. Guess until I’m playing with bigger amounts I should just stick with a broker than will loan me money instantly. It isn’t worth waiting so long for $50 for me personally

Edit: also would like to say I wasn’t disagreeing with you or slandering E*TRADE. Just new to the broker and was wondering how normal this was because I’d been very used to having an almost instantaneous transfer. (And yes I understand RH didn’t instantly receive my money and put it in my account. I know it takes time to move money around)"
2021-06-02 19:35:55,stocks,Well yeah I would have called them within a day if you confirmed the money left your bank account. You should see it as unsettled cash instantly.
2021-06-02 19:38:42,stocks,Hm interesting. I’ll give a call in the morning for sure
2021-06-02 17:44:18,stocks,"Profit is profit.. 
It could have drop 80% today.  Need to think both way"
2021-06-02 17:56:51,stocks,My dad told me no one ever went broke taking profits. Do what's best for you not everyone else
2021-06-02 18:01:03,stocks,So you do not remember February? Take that money while you can
2021-06-02 19:00:28,stocks,"Don’t overthink meme stock; they are a roller coaster. You ride, enjoy the profit/eat the loss, and get out. Rinse and repeat."
2021-06-02 18:52:09,stocks,"I just realized a while back that meme stocks (most spec plays in general) are not my investment. My head can't settle down with my money sitting in them. AMC could hit $20 or $100 tomorrow and nobody would really be surprised. It's a complete gamble. Once the day comes to a close the people who were right look like heroes but really just got lucky. I can't handle being wrong and no amount of due diligence will help me make the ""right"" choice.

So to answer your question, if you can't handle missing the tops and bottoms (which you always will) of highly volatile investments then they are not for you. 

Yes lots of money to be made. Also lots to be lost. Ask yourself how many days of your life are worth losing stewing over what could have been with these types of investments."
2021-06-02 18:00:55,stocks,I’ve decided to make it a bit of a game. I put in a small amount of “my” money and made a nice profit. I put “my” money back and now I’m playing with “house” money and want to see what I can turn that into over the next several years. This way I’m less concerned about the daily stuff and more curious about what I can turn a small investment into. Works for me. 🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-06-02 18:22:59,stocks,"I held 250 AMC 12 days ago. 15k profit I would have had. Also, If I had invested in any number of things I could probably be a millionaire. If I had bought a lottery ticket the other day, same thing."
2021-06-02 18:00:34,stocks,"If you’ve experienced bag holding after a pump and dump, then you feel better about gradually taking profit and not being greedy."
2021-06-02 17:47:54,stocks,"I did that same. Doubled my money flipped it into something I’m more happy with. 

For me GME ride was exhilarating and fun and I made a phenomenal return off it but I was a wreck with anxiety. Constantly checking so for me selling for a smaller profit on the way up was something I was ok with. Ultimately profit is profit"
2021-06-02 18:40:26,stocks,"If it makes you feel any better I fomo'd into AMC around $11 during the initial squeeze, averaged down to about $8 and then ended up selling for a small loss thinking it would never hit anywhere near $20 again. Looking at it today upwards of $60 hurt but I never could have anticipated a week like this. Nothing stings more than seeing an unrealized gain. The market is a fickle mistress; take the win when you can."
2021-06-02 18:03:57,stocks,"My own personal strategy when it comes to investing in these extremely volatile meme stocks is to get out with some profit while keeping a few shares in for the ride. For example this is how I've played AMC. 

Bought 30 shares at a cost of $10.45
Sold 12 shares around the $29 mark and that covered my initial investment and then a little extra. (Secured my money and some profit).
From there I sold 5 shares at $45 and another 5 at $55, securing a solid profit off the trade and now I have 8 shares to ride out the rest of this volatility. I may be able to sell at $100, I may screw up and miss out and sell on the way back down around $20, or somewhere in between. Regardless I secured a solid profit and still get to enjoy the ride.

Apologies if this is formatted weird, I am on mobile and usually a lurker so I don't know how to format well. Also, this is just my strategy, I'm sure there are much better strategies but this is comfortable for my risk level."
2021-06-02 17:50:25,stocks,"Ah, this is always the real question.  WHEN TO PULL OUT!!"
2021-06-02 17:45:39,stocks,"Realize that you got lucky and you made some money. AMC is realistically worth $5 a share and will be sub $10 EOY. You aren’t just lucky you bought early enough to experience the pump, but you sold early enough to not get caught in the trading freeze and sudden fall off that will be a vertical drop. Take your profits, don’t get emotional or get FOMO which is harder to say than do. Come up with your next plays. This meme stock blowup is making great entries to other value and growth stocks being neglected because people are flocking to meme stocks. Find your plays and remember anything you go into now you will be really early on because people are still hoping to catch the end of the AMC pump."
2021-06-02 17:53:57,stocks,One could be without a ceiling!
2021-06-02 19:00:06,stocks,"I’m in almost exactly the same boat, same numbers with AMC. Threw a bit of funny money at all the memes in feb, lost like 40% on AMC and GME. For a while it looked like the right move since it really seemed like the ride was over and I had just missed it. It has killed me watching GME since and definitely hurts seeing this today where I’d have made several thousand of I’d held rather than losing a few hundred. :sigh: a fickle mistress indeed. 

To the OP- definitely enjoy the win."
2021-06-02 17:55:27,stocks,"Only those who are truly commit or dangerously careless will never pull out. They let that come, and let it finish until they’re satisfied or the slap to the face come.

Either way, this is the beauty of love mak- I mean stock market."
2021-06-02 17:47:30,stocks,Thing is you could have bought in at basically any point in the day and sold 1hr later and made 10%.
2021-06-02 17:56:17,stocks,Of course there’s a ceiling to the profits. You honestly think they are going to allow the entire financial system to get dragged under by meme stocks. Nope
2021-06-02 17:50:20,stocks,I’m just waiting for puts to stop being so expensive. This is going to literally pay for my house on the way down.
2021-06-02 17:59:35,stocks,Unless everyone sells other shares to get greedy to ride the meme stock wave! Jk
2021-06-02 17:14:00,stocks,"Taxed on gains not initial investment.  

When you sell, you have realized gains.  So if you sell a position and make, $20k in a short term gain, you will pay short term capital gains tax on it.  If you invest that $20k in a stock and hold it, say you don’t sell by tax time and have an unrealized loss of $15k, you cannot subtract that loss from your 20k gains.  

You need to understand the difference between short and long term gains, and also more importantly realized and unrealized gains/losses."
2021-06-02 17:16:22,stocks,"Only on your gains. Ex if you put in 100 and you sell for 120, only 20 is taxable percentage. The rate depends on whether you held the stock for 1 year or less than 1 year where longer is a lower tax rate

Let's say you sold for 120 and invested it again and sold it for 150. Then you are only taxed for the 30 you subsequently made for that transaction.

 If this was all in the same year, then your total taxable income would be 50"
2021-06-02 18:56:07,stocks,Much appreciated. If I reinvest every cent I take out it still does not matter because I “realized” the gain the minute I took it out right?
2021-06-02 16:58:32,stocks,"Lol railroads are so stuffed right now they don’t even need to schedule, they just screw over all their customers by not servicing them on scheduled days because “we couldn’t find a crew”"
2021-06-02 18:29:22,stocks,"I find that with all that, either the railroad companies will get disrupted by a railroad startup looking to provide better service and more safety or I don’t know.

But at the end of the day, these issues are important and while they might seem small now, they can get bigger in the future."
2021-06-02 18:48:22,stocks,"Do you do anything that faces railroads? Like an industry serviced by railroads or logistics? 

I’m asking that because... you can’t disrupt a government-endorsed monopoly. It’s like expecting your utility to get disrupted by a startup. I don’t see it happening. 

The engineers running trains can only work very strict hours, just like pilots at major airlines. I’ve gotten stuck at a railroad crossing for 2 hours once because the engineer on the train hit his hours for the day and their relief had to walk 2 miles to get to the locomotive. It’s highly regulated. The biggest issues with lack of inspections is if something falls off a railcar on a main line and then that something derails it - I don’t think a derail source will be engineer fatigue.

I need to watch the Vice video or article you reference because what you’re saying and what I see everyday feels very different. Railcars can travel 3500 miles in a very short timeframe, if they’re getting inspected at those intervals it’s nothing more then a simple brake check and damage check."
2021-06-02 18:48:34,stocks,2 miles is 3.22 km

2021-06-02 19:55:20,stocks,"Just my opinion of course, so take it with a grain of salt.

Based on the Weekly Jobless Claum Reports during March, I am expecting the May Jobs Report to be good, better than April but very unlikely to be anywhere near as good as March, which saw almost 1 million jobs added to the economy"

2021-06-02 18:11:53,stocks,"Problem is that the idea of ""inferior product"" is in itself, a matter of opinion. For example, the Ford thing you mention has really never been true, especially not for their trucks. Ford has always had a reputation for solid trucks. The Netflix thing is also a matter of opinion.

Its important to separate opinion from fundamentals and not turn them into such. I dont like Apple products at all and I think they are very inferior but I sure like their business. I also hate McDonalds (products), Chipotle (products), Electronic Arts, Nestle (politically), all banks, Google (spyware), etc. But I acknowledge they are good businesses. For the record however, I dont own any of them but thats mostly due to valuation, not business fundamentals."
2021-06-02 15:38:06,stocks,"For short term, maybe, long term no. If you don't like the company you will be more likely to sell at bad times and if you don't trust their products long term at you beliefs hold true then they will likely not perform amazing except if you bought them at a very good price."
2021-06-02 15:42:55,stocks,"I tend to purchase stocks/companies that I think their product is the best, or can be the best, or has some market edge. Nothing earth shattering  or cutting edge- but things like TGT, AAPL, DIS, LOW make up a large portion of my portfolios.

I don’t like buying something because I feel like it’s “undervalued”. I’m not smart enough to know what an appropriate value for multi-billion dollar companies is. There are professionals who think AAPL is appropriately valued at $90 a share, and others who think $180 is a more appropriate valuation. It’s their full time job to analyze these things and come to their price targets. Why would I have any better understanding of what’s a fair value and what isn’t? The 20 minutes a day I watch CNBC or read some articles makes up a tiny fraction of the work professionals do.

But I am smart enough to know a good company/product from a bad one. A company with the legs (and $$$) to grow and continue to be at the forefront of their industries/sectors/etc. vs. a company who has struggled to grow and meet the demands of a changing world."
2021-06-02 16:07:55,stocks,I would never invest in a company that I believed made an inferior product
2021-06-02 16:52:12,stocks,"You should only enter positions where you think you have an edge. If you're going to buy a stock, that means knowing why the stock is 'undervalued' right now and why the market is wrong about it. I think it's possible to have these factors when you don't personally like the company's products, but as a default you should probably just stay away.  Your portfolio is going to be a couple dozen stocks out of the 1000s that are out there. You can afford to be selective."
2021-06-02 15:39:40,stocks,wether or not you like the products or services is irrelevant. look at the fundamentals.
2021-06-02 15:44:31,stocks,"You should always believe in the company and its products. Because the quality of the product determines long term growth. If you don’t believe the company has it, then you don’t invest in it."

2021-06-02 16:34:03,stocks,"In situations like this, I think there are a lot of stocks that aren't the right buys \*for me\*. There's a good chance other people can make money off them. But if I don't like the company or have a very clear reason for why I bought, then I don't buy it. There are just too many other investments out there.

For instance, I bought some NIO on hype. After I learned some more about it, I didn't really like all the volatility associated with China and it seemed pretty hype-oriented. It may make a lot of people a lot more money, but it's not for me."
2021-06-02 19:34:34,stocks,Stocks aren’t bought they are sold. If you don’t promote a stock who is going to buy it? I just found a stock which sells for 10% of book value. It’s too small to do anything with. But they are out there. Stock function of the belief of future earnings. When a company misses earnings there is usually a big sell off. Sometimes stock comes back to their original price and sometimes not.
2021-06-02 16:07:34,stocks,Product/service quality matters if you’re a long term investor. In theory an investor would not want to own an inferior company in the long run.

Investors will only pay for a ""good idea"" up to a certain point, then they want results in the form of profit.  Also, competitors like ThredUp have the exact same service, so what is special about Poshmark?  It's not like Poshmark has patents on exciting new technology that make it special, like Apple or Google do.  Poshmark and ThredUp just sell old clothes on apps.  They are digital thrift stores, though their clothes may be somewhat better than the Salvation Army store.

I agree that Poshmark is overvalued, Kohl’s has an order of magnitude on Poshmark in terms of money in (and out), and Kohl’s has them beat on EPS.

Poshmark probably has a good amount of potential growth baked into its price and is not really living up to it, so it’s a definite pass for me."

2021-06-02 14:03:56,stocks,"I think we all have regrets when some stocks rise by a large amount. You just need to accept that not everything always goes 100% your way. Not everything can be determined ahead of its time. 

I remember a time where my friend introduced me to Bitcoin back in 2012 way back when I was still in high school. We did some research and said “hey this could be a good investment”. We didn’t have a job nor extra money. We tried to talk to our parents about it even just asking for $100 to put into Bitcoin, but with no luck we just sat and watched it. We still often talk about it to reminisce about how we could have been living the life. I believe back then, 1BTC was $10 so a $100 investment would have been $379k today and nearly 600k at its peak earlier this year. 

I also did some research and wanted to invest into AMD back when it was $3 in 2015, I didn’t have money because I was in college and told my dad because he asked for advice for a $30k investment that he said was his gambling money. He didn’t listen and invested into an oil company and broke even after about a year. 

I don’t really regret much, but it just did reassure  me that putting good research into something can definitely yield good results. The good thing is that you still did make a hefty profit on it."

2021-06-02 14:49:03,stocks,Bought GME when it was at $40 before the first squeeze. Sold at $140. Bought AMC at $14 when GME was pumping. Sold at $7 and never got back again as i was sick and tired of meme stocks. Cry myself to sleep every night.
2021-06-02 13:56:55,stocks,"I sold at a small profit too. There was no way anyone could have known it went to $62 dollars. 

Honestly, this is just a pump and dump. AMC never went higher than 32 dollars per share in its history of trades. But it goes up to $62 dollars when most theaters haven’t reopened yet and profits are down? That’s a pump and dump."

2021-06-02 15:46:46,stocks,"u/JakTravis_u_SOB

It’s impossible to know where the market/certain stocks would reach. Nobody knows when is the best time to sell. One thing I learned is “There will always be another opportunity in the market.” You just have to find it. Also, the market may go down at any point. Such as the COVID-19 crash that happened last year. Stocks can quickly drop and that is a opportunity to buy in at a huge discount. As everyone knows, it’s always better to come out with profit then a loss"
2021-06-02 16:03:23,stocks,"Bought AMC when I thought it was a good value, sold it when I thought it wasn't. It has continued to go up. I'm not even remotely upset about it. Why? Because it's not worth the price people are asking for it. Sure I could've made a lot more money on it. Perhaps it goes up even higher and the missed opportunity increases. Eventually, it's going to come tumbling down though, and what is a dumb decision today will seem like a smart one in the future."
2021-06-02 16:20:09,stocks,I also sold 100 shares at $9 some months ago because I thought all the hype about was gone...

Day after I go in and see that my AMC shares had dropped by 25%, and went in to panic mode thinking I couldn't lose more. So I sold it. At a 25% loss. A week ago. The day after I bought in. 

*Dumb as bricks.*

But you live and you learn. My weed stocks have gone up to make up for my loss, but they won't cover the sting and shame I'll feel for a lil bit."
2021-06-02 16:54:38,stocks,"I bought 200 shares of TSLA at $70 and sold at $150 pre split. Owned a shitload of Bitcoin under $1 and sold it around $1 for some random shit. Had Amazon under $300. Owned weed stocks that ran 1000%+ in the months after I sold. Sold dozens of options contracts that would end up running 1000%+ in the next day or two. Can’t beat yourself up over it. I’ve also sold stocks near peak like QS at $130 and GME at $420. You win some, you lose some."
2021-06-02 17:48:25,stocks,"Look at it this way you’re talking about only 4K. I sold BA awhile back and three days later the position was +300k. It sent me on a tear made a trade that got me 100k, I waited until the next morning lost another 360k. Point is if you don’t erase potential trade gains from your mind, they will effect all your trades, and fuck you so hard, that you not only lost in the past, but you’ll keep losing into the future. I don’t want to be disrespectful, but 4K is not a lot to make up. Don’t set that goal, cause it’ll mess you up too. Do your best to return to the state of mind you had when you initially traded AMC and it is likely you will gain much more than 4K. Although nothing is guaranteed. This mental aspect of it is very very hard, I feel you on this."

But ya know what, each of those times I took profit that was extremely high and that I knew could have dropped in a second, and I turned $500 into 3 grand. Sure it's not 14,000 bucks, but if I held on to then I'd have probably rationalized it to 100, then 150, and ended up holding a bag like a certain other squeezed stock."

2021-06-02 16:24:29,stocks,So then what’s everyone’s usual $ or % cash out target amount?
2021-06-02 16:53:35,stocks,You were happy when you sold. That's all matters.
2021-06-02 17:06:09,stocks,Shouldn’t have paperhanded
2021-06-02 16:28:26,stocks,You still have a chance to ride the a rocket.
2021-06-02 14:41:06,stocks,"This. This mentality is so important, and I’m trying to maintain it as I go. All you can do in the moment is make the best decision you’re able, with the pieces you have and the situation you see."
2021-06-02 14:59:44,stocks,How do you go about dealing with a stock shooting you after you’ve sold? I’m trying to forget about it and not look at it etc but it’s a constant kick in the teeth whenever I think about it
2021-06-02 16:43:55,stocks,Might be irrelevant. if i have any number of shares at 3$ and if it went to 7$ per share. I would definitely sell it. Irrespective of looking at previous experiences and other stocks.  Sometimes that can be close to highest profit you get. Sometimes it reaches unreachable places. This is just my strategy. Never feel bad for taking what i got and invest in other stock or the same stock when it's the right time. By looking at our purchase history there are many number of stocks we could feel bad for if we think that way.
2021-06-02 14:54:42,stocks,"Would we be? I mean if we ALL knew, what kind of market would that make for. Magic HFT city? Self fulfilling profecy? Self unfulfilling profecy? Would we learn what the market would do tomorrow at exactly the same time every day, and the gamble would be to sell or hold just before that time, like some kind of quarterly earnings report?"
2021-06-02 18:54:45,stocks,This is the way to think. Don’t cry over spilled milk. It’s impossible to time the market.
2021-06-02 18:27:33,stocks,"This was very much a known and expected event and has been for the past 4 months. People all over Reddit have been trying to explain to you and you’ve shut your eyes, put your hands over your ears, and shouted lalalala at the top of your lungs. Those of us who knew, knew exactly what was coming and what’s still to come. 

And we still know what’s coming because we haven’t come to the end of our ability to predict the future. Gme is going to be the flagship squeeze. There will be other smaller squeezes that see a few hundred percent. GME is the big one. It is just getting started. 

We have been trying to explain this to your sub for the past 5 months and been called conspiracy theorists the whole time. Understand this, because it’s important. We were right all along. There was no conspiracy. The shorts have not covered. All of these meme stocks that we’ve been patiently trying to explain were still in play, are exploding. And if you think for one minute that retail could drive this kind of buying power across the board on a basket of stocks, many of which retail doesn’t care about at all, you’re out of your mind. Has anybody been pumping some of the random basket stocks like the one that starts with K and ends with oss? Bed bath and beyond? We might not be right in the future, but this one time, this one instance, where thousands and thousands of hours have gone into the DD produced from hundreds of thousands of people all over the world... we have been right, and will continue to be right. 

Help us help you. We’re not giving out financial advice. It would behoove you to do your own research and make your own calculations.

So consider this: shorts haven’t covered - they’re just beginning to close out positions on the smaller squeezes. The big one is GME. Retail owns the float of GME. And the squeeze is juuuuust starting. We got to watch the first defaulted margin call today, but the cascade has yet to commence. 

You do the math on whether you think it’s a good investment."
2021-06-02 19:55:08,stocks,I can’t predict the future!!! Whhhhaasaaaaaa
2021-06-02 14:56:13,stocks,That's why you leave a couple in on a winner.
2021-06-02 14:44:56,stocks,Nah thats different scale. Literally $1 million

2021-06-02 16:05:48,stocks,I feel ya just kicking myself $7000 would’ve been nicer than a small profit of a few hundred or so.
2021-06-02 17:30:24,stocks,"There is plenty of DD that was predicting this sort of price action, so to say no way anyone could know is disingenuous. Whether or not you believed it/bought into it is a different story."
2021-06-02 19:19:04,stocks,"Throw sound business logic out the window with these things. GameStop is trading at twice the price of Apple. It doesn’t matter what AMC’s business credentials are - that’s not what’s pushing this thing.

It’s a massive pump obviously, but are people going to dump? Who knows. GameStop got to $450. I’m not a $500k or 0 level moron here but who knows who high it’ll fly"
2021-06-02 14:16:53,stocks,"Call it pump and dump, but this shits running up into the thousands imo."
2021-06-02 15:34:53,stocks,That was me almost exactly but I sold yesterday at $32. Still a profit but today stings a bit lol.
2021-06-02 14:06:19,stocks,OMEGA LOL
2021-06-02 16:09:43,stocks,No one? You're saying there isn't an entire subreddit dedicated to this one stock going up in a parabolic fashion? I have a relatively small position in AMC but that is mainly because I was too lazy to read a lot of what those people were saying.
2021-06-02 16:48:30,stocks,I have a 6-4 14cc I rolled up from 11cc a couple weeks ago staring me in the face.  Can't wait till its gone so I can stop agonizing about it. The train ain't coming back this week.
2021-06-02 16:32:45,stocks,"Yeah you’re right. I guess we’ll see how long it holds. Everything adjusts sometime it seems and that’s when discount day happens, usually on good long term stocks anyway."
2021-06-02 16:39:22,stocks,Ummm I’ve been doing this less then a week. I knew to buy $AMC and am buying $BB now. These threads told me where the next smart move is.
2021-06-02 16:13:10,stocks,"For sure, my 1 year returns on a couple accounts are 30-40% i know it doesn’t say much cause $1-$2 is 100%... my 401 says 44% but also it’s probably counting from our bottoming out last year."
2021-06-02 16:06:29,stocks,Not bad

2021-06-02 15:56:17,stocks,"Idk 100% in a day is crazy. Like you wanna buy something but you know better cause tomorrow it could keep going or drop like a rock from profit taking

My hope is riding the CLOV game with 60 shares I guess

Edit: make it 75 shares. Sold my IPOF but a $60 loss on it hoping to make more instead on CLOV. And SoFi seems to be off to a good start. Sold a little PLTR but still got plenty. Trading in an HSA."
2021-06-02 15:55:38,stocks,Pokemon?
2021-06-02 16:41:32,stocks,"True true. I just wish i knew that next play to buy cheap now and depending how long it takes to get there

I’m hoping nio Palantir and CLOV make moves. I also hold some Tesla and other stuff too though"
2021-06-02 19:11:33,stocks,"Truth. My partner's friend told us to buy in at 10 I didn't listen, bought in at 19 sold at 26 and went back in at 33 but should have bought a lot more. Up 5K but really could've been up 100K - it hurts ... Bad"
2021-06-02 19:18:11,stocks,Yup. Sold AMC and GME at a loss and invested in ARKs over here. Don’t I feel like a chump 😂
2021-06-02 17:44:58,stocks,Oh yeah i had some GME a couple years ago and then it was sitting dead weight verse of bankruptcy and yep missed that Chance to hold something already almost worthless anyway at the time
2021-06-02 18:28:43,stocks,"Exactly.

People who always lament on how it coulda been better and go online to rant off sound entitled and downright humble bragging.

It's over, get over it. You win some, you lose some."
2021-06-02 16:39:47,stocks,Understandable. That sucks seeing that today. But hey i still went up $400 on my accounts on other stocks on a very sideways day
2021-06-02 16:10:45,stocks,"Yeah that’s exactly the thing when we’re at our day jobs during trade times it’s hard to watch without setting stop losses and the likes

2021-06-02 16:27:49,stocks,"Feel that, but don’t do that. Just would’ve been a nice payout is all even after the tax man who couldn’t use a few grand.

That and we’re surrounded by so much financial advice or gurus or YouTubers we just don’t know who to trust or at the end of the day we’re rolling the dice. Some stocks have so much volume too and others have nothing and never move."

2021-06-02 17:16:29,stocks,"Also: any profit, no matter how little, is a win."
2021-06-02 18:11:31,stocks,"Reading this makes me feel better. Sold my shares when it reached 25 (before memorial day weekend) thinking it will come down. Next thing I saw was that it just doubled. At that point, this is the best decision I made. Secure my profits."
2021-06-02 16:13:11,stocks,Just remember the phrase “there’s always a bigger fish” and you will be fine.
2021-06-02 16:19:27,stocks,"I do the same, remove it from the watchlist and be happy with the profit."
2021-06-02 16:48:03,stocks,"It’s a common to feel like “this was it, my one big chance to hit it big and I fucked it up” while watching a stock sore. Think about how ridiculous that is though, it wasn’t your last chance, there will definitely be more, just don’t be a paper handed bitch like myself. I had 300 AMC  shares @ $11.50 and about 50 6/18 $13 BB calls. I sold both for a loss last month. I would have made over $30k if I held which is more than all my savings for me so I feel your pain but let’s get the next one.

Edit: I’m balls deep in PSFE now and I’m not letting go."
2021-06-02 16:33:00,stocks,"Seller’s remorse. We all suffer from this short-term illness sooner or later. My last bout was when RoKu was $15 bucks a pop. Had a bunch....say around 100 shares or so. Wasn’t doing much and I saw another play so I sold RoKu. And u know the rest of the story; shoots up 50 or so in a few days 😢. Felt like my wife had left me, but she didn’t and it will happen again. You can buy and hold all u want, but you’re always looking for a better play. It’s not the end. There are countless ways to profit in stocks and hindsight is always 20/20. I also had a pittance in Apple when it was about $10, but bailed when it went to $3.00. A great time to be alive!👍🌈"
2021-06-02 16:20:49,stocks,"Exactly, i wasn’t really seeking it, just saw it as #1 and GME #2 on the fidelity top stocks list of the day, most traded on their platform then AMC was highest volume. Trading plenty more shares than outstanding"
2021-06-02 16:38:26,stocks,"it's the same kind of mindfulness as anything for me.  there are plenty of opportunities in my life I missed out on for a variety of reasons, but they didn't happen.  So I either walk around besot by remorse or I walk around NEVER THINKING ABOUT MY EX AT ALL EVEN THOUGH I INVESTED WHEN SHE WAS A $2 STOCK wait what are we on about"
2021-06-02 18:53:04,stocks,I bought TSLA just after its IPO...100 shares.  I thought I was doing the right thing when I sold them for 35% profit.  That was before I learned of things like Ichimoku clouds and such.    I didn't take anoter position until about 1+ ago when they were around $350 per share.  I am holding on this time.
2021-06-02 18:47:51,stocks,"This is so true. On these meme stocks if you find yourself in a position to take an above-average profit, take it and run. People hoping to turn their 100% gain into a 200% gain usually end up missing the spike and holding red."
2021-06-02 17:26:51,stocks,Prophecy. Jesus.
2021-06-02 17:31:54,stocks,"I was taught to cash out 20% at a time. Ideally the first 20% sale covers your initial investment and after that, it’s all profit."

1,200 x $3000
Or
6000 x $600"

2021-06-02 14:46:54,stocks,I threw it all into GME so it probably ended up making me just as much haha
2021-06-02 15:09:34,stocks,"Very true, no way to know until it happens"
2021-06-02 17:45:18,stocks,"Good question haha. 

This is all hindsight, at the time when I found these investments, I didn’t think they would have gone from $10 to like $60k in like 8-10 years and I didn’t think AMD would have gone from $3 to $90 (at its peak). My AMD investment I had in my notebook that my 10 year target was $20. I had that model back in my old laptop which I threw out after finishing college. I also stopped following AMD when I saw it go up to $10 the next year lol. 

The thing with these hindsight outlooks is that I don’t really know if I would have held the investment to its peak. I had a price target of $20 in 10 years for AMD for example, would I have sold when it hit $10 the next year? Or at $20? I do know I would have revised my projections, but it’s still impossible to know if I would have held on. 

Even though I’d love to attribute what I did as “skill”, I can’t because it really was *luck* that a friend mentioned Bitcoin to me, and i found AMD through thinking back at bitcoin and finding out that mining Bitcoin requires more and more computing power. At the time I only know of NVDA and AMD that were big names which led me to researching more on AMD and NVDA."
2021-06-02 19:18:35,stocks,A broken clock...
2021-06-02 14:22:49,stocks,That’s what was said about GME and the highest it reached was $400. AMC is not going into the thousands.
2021-06-02 15:50:54,stocks,Imagine when it’s $400 after all these options expire in the money
2021-06-02 16:20:01,stocks,fucking goobers don’t wanna give credit to those who deserve it lol
2021-06-02 16:51:58,stocks,"If it makes you feel any better, the meme stocks are literally like gambling. You can either hit big or lose your eyes. Look at it this way, as long as your other positions are doing well, that's all that matters.

trust me, I would've loved to end up as some sort of reddit millionaire, but consistent returns and smart plays over a period of years/decades will pay off in the end."

2021-06-02 16:35:10,stocks,you know they're not profitable right? you know TSLA shot up under a short squeeze mechanism right?
2021-06-02 14:55:38,stocks,"Depends on the price. it's not up 100% on the day, but it's up a lot too. And if you got in at 40$ or even 4$, hello, I'm your long lost uncle cousephew."
2021-06-02 14:58:28,stocks,"They literally deleted the buy button, the only thing that can make the price go up. And I'm not saying amc will go to the thousands, or any other one will go to X price, but this thing is going a bit higher for at least a while little bit."
2021-06-02 14:32:48,stocks,The only reason GME didn't go into the thousands is because Robinhood restricted buying.
2021-06-02 15:48:49,stocks,"who said this is over? look at TSLA, it took years for it to squeeze. and there was a whole lot less short fuckery going on with it compared to AMC and GME."

Shit i wish i had tons of tesla at $17 and didn’t think that $200-$300 was once expensive... when i started my IRA i had a few thousand to throw in (actually from a casino win) so i took my win and started an IRA, traditional (to be like what money? Tax deductible) then create a Roth and now work provides an HSA. I think I’m doing okay, some stuff tanks and until it rebounds but damn. If i believed in Tesla and held onto it that would be a great payday. Instead i had some apple and stuff like that. Again depends how long we can hold, we sell our profits but should let the good companies run a little longer

$4000/$200 a share maybe maybe even less would be 20 shares and then if it’s split adjusted $3000/share $60,000. Damn! Again oh well can’t dwell on it just wish i was smarter or maybe a financial advisor helped grow it. I guess instead you stay somewhat stable, smaller positions but sometimes grow some balls for bigger ones $1 gain on 1 share meh, $1 on 100 shares now we’re talking but it also bleeds 100x as much too. Double edged sword.

Playing our cards right could basically buy you a house or something or secure your retirement down the line ya know... in a generation where home prices just keep going up and all that stuff. The right investment could possibly be life changing sometime.

Hard part is a good one that stays good after a year for lower taxes cause these others spike and drop and you’ll have max taxes."

2021-06-02 15:39:12,stocks,"Let me respond to some individual points to spark up a conversation:

(As a general point, I agree 100% that you need to ignore the narrative and think independently).

>There was an assumption that somehow, via technology and financial engineering, we had beaten the system and unlocked a new paradigm.

OK, so what is the prevailing ""new paradigm"" right now? That central banks and governments (specifically, the Biden administration and the Fed) can simultaneously keep both, interest rates and inflation under control while applying fiscal policy leading to economical growth? And that this is bullish for stocks (despite multiple warnings about corporate and income tax increases) since TINA?

>To me this looks like speculative behavior. Used car prices are going through the roof due to, not only decreased supply, but more importantly to increased demand, with so much free money sloshing around in the system. And since prices keep going up and up, the dealers were eager to buy her car so that they could later flip it, regardless of the state it was in. Sound familiar?

Yes, but I believe that the used car bubble is driven by demand from Carvana, Vroom, etc. that are burning investor money while attempting to take market share. This is very similar to the ride sharing and food delivery bubbles, it's a ""winner take it all"" race where Carvana would eventually raise prices and stop losing money on acquiring inventory once they had gained sufficient market share. Also, there's some evidence that people are less willing to use public transport post-Covid etc. My point is you should try to explain the individual business dynamics instead of just inducing from individual examples that everything is a bubble (although I don't disagree that if interest rates were at 5%, we wouldn't be seeing such distortions in used cars, ride sharing or food delivery).

>How about Warren Buffet saying he's seeing massive price increases all across the board?

Yes, there's absolutely price inflation, especially in commodities, transportation etc. But these could be supply-driven and therefore ""transitory"" like the Fed says (not saying believe them, but don't assume they are wrong or unforthcoming about everything either).

>What about the boom in that which shall not be named in this sub? 

Agreed it's a speculative asset bubble, made worse by the stimulus checks. However, look at the bright side: without this, stocks would be even more expensive for you and me to buy. ;)

>Look at Archegos

Hwang took crazy risks and it was incredible how he could buy using swaps like he did with no trace of his purchases until he blew up. However, he might have had a reasonable thesis (consolidation coming in the space), just look at the recent Warner Discovery deal. Traders using leverage blow up all the time, why would this be a sign of a greater bubble? Margin/debt has been cheap for at least 10 years now.

>Look at Tesla

Expensive stock, retail heavy shareholder base. How badly overvalued is it though? 2x, 4x, 10x? They grew unit sales close to 100% year-over-year. I won't buy the stock, but I wouldn't bet they're not around and a $500B company 10-15 years from now either.

>Last night I heard Josh Brown on CNBC say

Right, but we know better than to pay heed to charlatans on CNBC...

>Covid doesn't count. It barely scratched the market, and the rebound has been insane.

Well, yes, unprecedented, but pay attention to what Warren Buffett said in the 2021 AGM: the situation looked quite different before the Fed stepped in. We can debate whether or not they should have done that (they could have let corporations fall into distress with their debt funding). But what March 2020 shows is that the market can still react and draw down very violently if prospects for business conditions worsen dramatically. It's just that given how the powers that be handled the crisis, business conditions today don't look anything like they did in March 2020 (or September 2008).

>I told him, in this case, your ignorance is more insightful than their ""expert"" methodology. 

Yes, ""expert"" is a vague designation. People have their varying levels of knowledge, competence and their incentives (either personal or professional or both). Warren Buffett risked his reputation by going against the narrative in his Sun Valley speech in 1999 and then subsequently again several times in the early 2000s. I would call him an expert on business, stocks and even markets and the economy. The ordinary ""experts"" however, don't have his fame, abilities, dedication or financial freedom to think independently and speak freely.

>And I believe economists, the Fed, and the market are clinging to the view that we can predict the market, and as long as we make the right adjustments (via QE and fiscal policy), we will be OK.

Right, they have no idea what's going to happen, nobody does. Charlie Munger said ""there's one very intelligent man who thinks it's dangerous and that's just the start.""

>I believe that ultra-easy monetary policy and the resulting extraordinary levels of public and private debt are going to end up causing some sort of crisis. I also believe that inflation will be a problem, and perhaps a serious one.

You can try to protect against inflation to an extent with your investments. I agree that the level of debt (this time, public debt) is unprecedented and I would mostly echo Druckenmiller that there is no way that the government is going to put 30% of tax revenue into debt service (which is what 5% or higher interest rates would mean). So the Fed will have to do YCC like in the 1940s and monetize the debt, weakening the dollar.

However, I still try to concentrate on individual stock and business analysis. I actually find the current market better for the stock picker than the late 2019 market, when everything was uniformly ""bid"" after that long bull market run. Since March 2020, the market has been more volatile and that creates opportunities."

2021-06-02 15:42:52,stocks,"I'm in favor of healthy skepticism and I agree that most supposed experts have no idea or are optimizing for something other than correctness. With that said, I'm still comfortable taking the other side of this trade in the medium term. I think we're currently in the early part of the economic recovery. As the economy is coming back we are running into a bunch of bottlenecks, for example in auto manufacturing, that are causing temporary price spikes. I think these will be smoothed out and they don't indicate persistent high inflation or rampant speculation.

I'm also encouraged that the speculative excess has actually cooled off a bit (look at ARKK over the last year). The pandemic (and resulting stimulus) has caused a bunch of new people to enter the market, which will be interesting to watch and will make 'meme stocks' continue to be a thing.

I definitely respect your position and I think both of us will learn something in the coming months. It's exactly this kind of uncertainty and different needs and perspectives that makes for a living market.

The real bet is will the central banks stop the party and quit devaluing the dollar?  The last 40 years tells us that they will never raise interest rates again and actually cannot if they don't want to implode the economy.

It's incredibly sad but it is what it is.  You might be able to ride small short term trends here and there but in the long term asset holders will grow the wealth gap further and further.  Only want to prevent it is stop unit currency that can we inflated away.

2021-06-02 15:17:57,stocks,"Yeah, this is pretty much right on the money about how I feel about things in the market at the moment. 

Early this year, my siblings were clamoring for me to get involved with the market. They figure that with my background in math and science, I'd surely excel here. I tried my hand at some gambles, got my fingers burnt a bit, and then began to read investing books as I bought stocks in companies I felt confident in holding. Before I knew it, more than half of my savings was in equities in less than 2 months time from zero.

But the more I read about valuation and trading, the more I felt like I had wandered into a trap. As I poured over balance sheets and income statements, comparing against price history and taking into account macro-scale conditions, I became more and more convinced that these conditions are abnormal. This kind of market is the kind that older investors long gone warn people about. The fact that I, along with my siblings, were suddenly actively engaging with something we never trusted before with reckless abandon was proof positive that euphoria was running wild; I was caught up in it, too, and I didn't notice at all until I took a step back. 

I've since my high point liquidated 5/6 of my portfolio for a small gain. Only a small portion remains in equities that I am convinced are not overvalued---about 10% of my entire portfolio. For the time being, I will wait this hysteria out."

That's a good point, but you're not just seeing prices go up in used cars.  CPI is up.  PPI is up.  Asset prices are up.  Real estate is up.  There's evidence of massive speculation in crypto, meme stocks, and in the broader market in general (Archegos, for example).  Margin debt is at an all-time high.  Corporate debt is at an all-time high.  Federal debt is at an all-time high.  The Fed's balance sheet is at an all-time high.

>Yes, there's absolutely price inflation, especially in commodities, transportation etc. But these could be supply-driven and therefore ""transitory"" like the Fed says (not saying believe them, but don't assume they are wrong or unforthcoming about everything either).

They could be right! But the whole point of this post is that I think they're wrong.  The reasons why I think so were explained in more detail.  They famously said that subprime was contained in 2007.  So it's not like the Fed has never made a huge mistake before.

I could be wrong, of course, but this is my current opinion.

Personally I think it was right to step in to some degree, but long-term I see too much reliance on this sort of policy, with little reflection for what long-term unintended consequences it might have.  William White talks a lot about this.  See [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf).

It means people are getting more reckless.  All the banks who loaned to Hwang didn't even bother to check who else might be lending to him.  Interest rates have been low for 10 years, but the amount of Fed asset purchases plus fiscal stimulus right now is unprecedented.

>You can try to protect against inflation to an extent with your investments.

Morover you simply need to look at the housing market to confirm mortgage companies having a great time, houses are selling way over ask and demand far outstrips supply. 

Many companies really have not been harmed by this. Certain *sectors* have yes, including travel, entertainment, the hospitality industry and so on have been negatively impacted, this is true and is probably a contributing factor to lower GDP growth but you are dead wrong if you want to argue every company ever is struggling right now.

2021-06-02 17:41:15,stocks,">Your problem is arguing total GDP growth and not looking at individual sectors. You're taking a blanket approach to a topic that is truly MUCH more complex than that. Moreover avg GDP growth has ALWAYS been more lax than total market growth. Average GDP growth from 1980-2018 was 1.67% per year. The S&P 500? Avged about 7-10% per year.

What's complex about it?  GDP is a blanket indicator, S+P 500 is a blanket indicator.  If your argument is that tech might swing valuations up higher, then the tech-light DJIA went up about 27% in that same period.

7-10% a year with 1-2% GDP growth has nothing to do with 25%+ a year with *negative* GDP growth.   That's not a fair comparison at all.

>I named several individual companies that have had record years or at least very profitable years. And I can also confirm for you as someone who works in furniture sales that furniture is literally through the roof right now and the company I worked for just closed out a record year.

That's great!  Of course some businesses made it out okay.  That doesn't mean the economy did.  If you don't like GDP, look at [unemployment](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate).  Unemployment jumped from about 3% to about 15%.  Would you really argue that the economy as a whole was more productive during this time?

>Morover you simply need to look at the housing market to confirm mortgage companies having a great time, houses are selling way over ask and demand far outstrips supply.

You're proving my point.  You can't have a sustainable recovery based on demand only. You need supply.  Negative GDP growth and skyrocketing unemployment shows that supply (production) is down.  The reason for such high demand is because the Fed is printing money and making borrowing cheap.  It's a phony recovery.

Not every company ever is booming, no, but the economy was deeply wounded by this.  That's why such aggressive monetary and fiscal policies were pursued in the first place."

The GDP is an indicator of the ENTIRE economy.

The S&P 500 is just 500 US companies. The two aren't really equivalent and shouldn't mirror each other--and they don't.

>Unemployment jumped from about 3% to about 15%.

And rapidly dropped down to 6.1% today.... and is projected to keep decreasing. Come on man you're cherry picking half the data here... We both damn well know that unemployment was very volatile last year.

Moreover the unemployment rate today is not really comparable to other unemployment rates of the past. There is [no employment shortage](https://www.epi.org/blog/u-s-labor-shortage-unlikely-heres-why/) in fact there's an *employee* shortage thanks to stimulus plans not really incentivizing people to find work. There certainly is jobs there for people when those stimulus plans open back up and a lot of jobs are even increasing wage offerings to get people to come apply.

I feel like you're looking at raw data and coming to conclusions without actually looking at the world around you for actual causation factors. We live in unprecedented times to be sure and the circumstances of today aren't really driven by the same factors as '08, so taking an even analysis between the two and predicting a crash just because of what happened then isn't entirely accurate.

Could we have a crash in a year? Sure. But I don't see anything signalling that and we could just as easily see another 5 years of growth.

>has nothing to do with 25%+ a year with negative GDP growth. That's not a fair comparison at all.

Yes, that's what I'm referring to here: the health of the entire economy.  Why should the stock market perform on how well one specific sector does?  There's either expansion in the economy or there's not, and in this case there wasn't.

>And rapidly dropped down to 6.1%.... and is projected to keep decreasing. Come on man you're cherry picking half the data here... We both damn well know that unemployment was very volatile last year.

I don't understand what's volatile about it.  It spiked because people got laid off, and it began to decline as we learned to handle the new situation and things slowly began to get back to normal.  That's not volatile - it's predictable.  The point is that Covid *was* a major disruption.  We're still not back to where we were.  

You also to remember that not everybody has recovered as quickly as the US.  Europe hasn't recovered as quickly as the US.  And emerging markets have most definitely not recovered as quickly as the US.  This has a huge effect on the US and global supply chains as well.

>Moreover the unemployment rate today is not really comparable to other unemployment rates of the past. There is no employment shortage in fact there's an employee shortage thanks to stimulus plans not really incentivizing people to find work. There certainly is jobs there for people when those stimulus plans open back up.

Again, you're proving my point.  What's good about an employee shortage?  That means people aren't producing things, yet up and up goes the stock market, further and further away from fundamentals.

>Which as others already noted we already had a flash crash for in the first 2 quarters when the GDP was the worst off.

It's not a flash crash.  It's the shock caused by Covid which began to stabilize as I mentioned before.  The economy has performed exactly as we would expect it to.  It's the stock market that hasn't.

>\[GDP actually RAPIDLY\]([https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/gross-domestic-product-4th-quarter-and-year-2020-advance-estimate#:\~:text=Real%20gross%20domestic%20product%20(GDP,real%20GDP%20increased%2033.4%20percent.)](https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/gross-domestic-product-4th-quarter-and-year-2020-advance-estimate#:~:text=Real%20gross%20domestic%20product%20(GDP,real%20GDP%20increased%2033.4%20percent.)) began rebounding in Q3 and Q4 thus being reflected by the fast recovery in many sectors.

Good point, but I still don't believe that breaking even with GDP justifies the meteoric rise in the stock market.  What fundamentals is that based on?  And look at the quarterly change in Q4.  Q3 was a rapid reset, yes, but after that things barely moved.  Yet up and up goes the stock market.

I'd also like to point out that I think it's commonly accepted that the Fed's monetary policy is a primary cause of these valuations right now.  Nobody really denies that.  What they might disagree with is thinking that this presents any sort of problem going forward.

The rapid gains in the stock market, any way you look at it, are most certainly not justified by equal gains in productivity.

>Moreover, as you said yourself we are overall net green now. Which really kills your thesis. Why should we have a crash to reflect a crashed GDP that is in the rear view mirror now???

That's a good question.  We're in the green now, but corporate, margin, and federal debt are all at insanely higher levels than pre-crisis.  Valuations of stocks are at much higher levels than pre-crisis.  At the very least, even if things are going well, this trend would have to stop or slow down while fundamentals take time to catch up.  That is, if they can, before we start seeing issues with all the debt, and/or inflation."

You missed the second bit where I stated that the S&P 500 is just a blanket record of 500 US companies. Not the entire economy. Hence why it's almost always decoupled from GDP growth in any given year. It trading different than the GDP is not at all a new thing.

>I don't understand what's volatile about it. 

Compare that umeployment trend to 2007 leading into '08:

https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2009/jan/wk2/art02.htm?view_full#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20the%20number%20of,rate%20rose%20to%207.2%20percent.&text=The%20number%20of%20long%2Dterm,by%201.3%20million%20in%202008.

The two aren't really comparable. What happened last year was very very unprecedented. You usually see a trend up when leading into and during recessions and economic crises, not a spike up and then a spike right back down in a few short months.

>Again, you're proving my point. What's good about an employee shortage? 

Not really.

You need to look at fundamentally why unemployment is normally historically a bad thing.

Unemployment is bad because it's usually due to a *labor* shortage and generally means people on average have less money to spend and will drastically cut back on spending thus, reflecting poorly on company profits. People aren't willingly not working as much as they're forced out of work with no real income. Thus stock market go down.

An employee shortage where people don't want or need to go back to work doesn't reflect this. People are getting money from other sources, thus spending does not decrease, ergo company profits remain stable despite people not working, as we again see in a lot of sectors in the past year. This would only be catastrophic if we were seeing mass shutdowns of businesses across the country which we aren't seeing yet.

>That means people aren't producing things,

Clearly not really the case. Again read my article. US manufacturing is not really impacted, hell the US imports most of the shit these days anyways and most companies outsource their actual production overseas. Production hasn't really been shown to have slowed down except semiconductors but that's not really a US employment problem but a covid caused issue that once again is primarily produced overseas, not here. You'll notice that the areas that are having the most trouble finding employees are low wage jobs, not higher earning positions. Nobody's trying to take 31k/year in unemployment for opportunities in jobs offering 50k+ or more with benefits.

>but I still don't believe that breaking even with GDP justifies the meteoric rise in the stock market.

Again, the S&P 500 has never gone up by the same degree as the GDP. By this logic we can literally apply this thesis to literally every year in history and just about every year to come. Clearly this isn't a very good indicator of when a crash is to come or else we should have had a crash literally every year for the past 30 years."

But that's the problem!   Other sources are from a combination of federal deficit spending and the Fed monetizing it via money printing. The wealth is not real, it's being created out of thin air.  That's not a sustainable situation.

As I mentioned, the fact that US production doesn't really matter since most of it is imports makes things even worse!  Covid was worse internationally than it was in the US.  Well, maybe not at the beginning, but in terms of the vaccination rollout yeah.

>Again, the S&P 500 has never gone up by the same degree as the GDP. By this logic we can literally apply this thesis to literally every year in history and just about every year to come.

But it's an issue of degrees.  8-10% during an expanding economy is not the same as 25%+ during a contractionary one in the midst of a major crisis.  As I mentioned before, nobody is really arguing that the Fed's policies aren't contributing to the current valuations.

Anyway, I feel I've made my points and I will continue to stand by them.   I will be leaving this here for now, thanks for making me think (that bit about about quarterly GDP change was especially interesting), and best of luck with your investing!"
2021-06-02 18:44:28,stocks,">    Other sources are from a combination of federal deficit spending and the Fed monetizing it via money printing.

There's a lot of reasons why federal defecit fears are overblown.

Also it should be clear by now that massively bad hyperinflation is just not going to happen. Despite all the printing we saw in 2020 we were only met with a larger-but-still-far-short of a weimar hyperinflation situation inflation rate of 4%. 

>The wealth is not real, it's being created out of thin air.

It's not even wealth. People are clearly spending this money or else we would indeed very much be in a recession still. Fun but kinda off topic fact, but everyone adopting a super high savings rate would also be bad for the economy.

>That's not a sustainable situation.

I agree! At least for now. 

I could talk for hours why programs like UBI are probably an inevitable necessity but for now, these programs have expiration dates, many of which are rapidly approaching. People  on average will be forced to return to work sooner rather than later and the good news is that the jobs many of them left are still there to take them in and there is enough jobs there for them.

We'd be looking at a much more dire issue if these jobs didn't exist.

>As I mentioned, the fact that US production doesn't really matter since most of it is imports makes things even worse!

Okay but this has been the case for decades now. Again not really a firm thesis to use, because we could apply this to any year in the last 10 year bull run that also failed to see a crash. 

If you must know companies actually increase profit margins and cut costs by doing this and so far has been maintained with a low 3% unemployment rate during the Obama and Trump years so nothing really to lose your head over. 

>8-10% during an expanding economy is not the same as 25%+ during a contractionary one in the midst of a major crisis.

Really depends on what dragged down the GDP vs what pumped the S&P 500. I don't think you'd find anyone telling you shit is not overvalued right now(Which is why who knows? Perhaps we will have a crash soon.) but again to really determine that we're in a dire situation you'd need to look far deeper then just blanket S&P 500 rate vs GDP rate. Your Analysis would need to be far more in depth to arrive at this conclusion and I'm not convinced that a lot of your reasoning leads to the conclusion that we will see an ensuing recession."

2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"20y/o getting into stocks and starting a Roth IRA, Need advice please :) Hello!

I’m a 20 year old college student currently working full time and have been since the beginning of 2021 to August. I’ve gotten a lot of advice about starting a Roth IRA as a good use of my savings.


I’ve only recently gotten into the Stock market and have RH (bad, I know) and Binance accounts where I haven’t withdrawn anything out (long term holding most of it).

However, I have also started a Fidelity Brokerage and Roth IRA account and planning to transition from RH to Fidelity completely. I have some questions about all of this if anyone could give me some advice:

1) Am I able to transfer stocks (ETFs) from a brokerage account into my Roth IRA account? (from RH -> Fidelity Brokerage -> Roth IRA). Would you recommend this? 

2) I plan to put in around 4000-6000$ in my Roth IRA in 2021. How would I best use this money on investments? Should I just keep it simple and buy ETFs and what ones are best?

Any advice and tips and knowledge appreciated!
Thank you!"
2021-06-02 12:07:34,stocks,"Regarding the first question; no, you are not able to transfer in-kind between those two differently taxed accounts. You would need to sell shares from your brokerage, withdraw the proceeds, and contribute to the Roth.

In terms of what to invest in, look up the Boglehead investing strategy. It is focused on low cost, broad-based index funds that track the entire US stock market, the S&P 500, and international stocks. Bonds too, but that’s for much later in your life.

ETFs are VTI (or VOO) and VXUS. You can buy them without a fee at Fidelity. The Vanguard mutual fund equivalents should be avoided, because they do incur a fee. Fidelity does have a fund called FSKAX however, that is essentially similar to VTI."
2021-06-02 12:12:51,stocks,"No, you can't transfer ETFs to your Roth IRA. If you want you can transfer them to another brokerage (you'll have to pay a fee tho) but not to your IRA. You can sell your assets but you'll pay taxes on your capital gains.   
I would suggest you keep both. There's nothing wrong with that.

In my opinion, how you invest your money depends on the amount of time you want to spend researching. If you don't want to spend time researching companies, balance sheets invest with ETFs. If you want to learn more about the stock market and it is something that you enjoy doing, you can go ahead and find companies you like and invest in individual stocks. 

If you go the ETF route you can find ETFs by Fidelity online. I would suggest you invest 50% of your portfolio in an S&P500 ETF and then chose whatever you like. Technology, Semiconductors, Energy, whatever.

If you want to learn more about stocks you can find everything online. I would suggest watching Peter Lynch and Warren Buffet interviews on youtube or reading Books like ""One Up on Wallstreet"", ""The Intelligent Investor"" and stuff like that. 

You can also do both. You can own an S&P500 ETF and then some stocks like Apple, Microsoft, or whatever you like."

2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"MRNA in bubble?  

MRNA current price: $193, all time high as of right now. MRNA price on Jan 1, 6 mo ago: $104.47. MRNA price 15 mo ago (March 13 2020): \~$20. On this last date the MRNA market cap was 7.5 billion. These dates/prices are chosen very intentionally and paint a simple 0th order picture. Before the covid hype MRNA was valued at $20. The total market has grown \~40% since then (comparing total market index then and now), which, all else equal would suggest a price today for MRNA of $28 – not bad. But clearly we’re not factoring in vaccine profits. Moderna was approved in the U.S. in mid December \[1\] and EU approval was expected soon after so vaccine profits were priced in by the Jan 1 date at $104.47.

This price already seems too high though… depending on the sale the Moderna vaccine sells for $15 to $20 per dose \[2\]. They reached a deal to sell the U.S. 300 million and the EU 150 million doses, generously totaling $10 billion. A one time sale, yet their market cap has increased 10x from 7.5 bil to \~75 bil (read: overbought) \[3\]. The only way this makes ANY sense is if they’re counting on a significant mass of the global population > 1 billion people ( note they have “plans to make 1.4 bil doses in 2022”\[2\]) to purchase booster shots every year. To their credit, they announced a deal with UNICEF this morning to be a “long term” supplier and supply 45 million vaccines to them in 2022, but this is a far cry from their required numbers (this deal is why MRNA is at ATH right now). Do we really think MRNA is going to be able to bring > 1 billion doses to market and find enough willing buyers?

I don't think so, and I think the market reflects my uncertainty. First, Moderna’s main competitor (Pfizer) has been shown to be more user friendly and have less side effects now that some 150 million have tried the two. \[4,5\] Furthermore, with Pfizer, J&J, Jensen and others the covid vaccine market is actually showing up to be fairly competitive. Lastly, and very importantly, a large fraction of the people who haven’t YET got the vaccine never intend to: “nearly 40% of Americans say they will definitely not or probably not get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them”. \[6\] This information, combined with the fact that MRNA stock is severely overbought looks to me like a ticking time bomb. MRNA’s boosted position seems incredibly fragile and has already tried to dump recently on three occasions (1 yr chart: dec 11, feb 19, may 4th )

And the reason it’s going to dump is because the current bullish valuation requires MRNA to hold a practical monopoly over the vaccine market for years to come. The facts are unraveling and this is very much showing not to be the case. If they maintain their current market share at \~500 million vaccines per yr (unlikely as we will see), this translates to an adjusted market cap of 45 billion and about the $104 price we saw in January. So the base prediction given information here-to-now is that MRNA will dump to \~$110, a 40% decrease due the fact that the MRNA vaccine production monopoly was a pipe dream all along.

And furthermore, it seems the covid treatment/prevention market may be open to even more competitors outside of vaccines. Discovered by Satoshi Omura who received a Nobel Prize for the work, Ivermectin is a cheap, not-under-patent, common drug that’s been used for forty years as a common anti-parasitic.

In Latin America, where the U.S. fancy MRNA tech is nary to be found, the people (and the market) have settled on a different solution. “The drug has been so in demand that in May health-care workers passed out some 350,000 doses to residents in northern Bolivia. That same month, the Peruvian police seized around 20,000 bottles of animal-grade ivermectin that was sold on the black market as a treatment for human coronavirus infections. And in July, a university in Peru announced that it would produce 30,000 doses to bolster the country’s supply.” \[7\] This article advocates caution because, at the time “data is scant”. But that was many months ago (oct 2020), now the data is in.

What started the rush was a demonstration that Ivermectin completely stopped covid19 replication in a petri dish \[8\], but would it do the same to covid in the human body? Well – what was the result of the mass buying in Peru? For the 24 peruvian states that implemented IVM treatment (and Lima), excess deaths quickly dropped by 75% after only 45 days. \[9\] “Extraneous causes of mortality reductions were ruled out.” At higher doses Ivermectin could be 80 to 99% effective at preventing Covid19 if taken preemptively. One trial done in Argentina had \~1,200 healthcare workers, \~400 did not take Ivermectin and the other \~800 did. Of the \~400 people who did not take Ivermectin over half of them fell sick with covid. Of the 800 who did take it, 0 (ZERO!) fell ill. \[10,11\] And lastly, meta-analysis studies: “98% of the 52 studies to date report positive effects. Random effects meta-analysis for early treatment and pooled effects shows an 81% reduction, RR 0.19 \[0.09-0.39\], and prophylactic use shows 85% improvement, RR 0.15 \[0.09-0.25\]. Mortality results show 76% lower mortality, RR 0.24 \[0.14-0.42\] for all treatment delays, and 84% lower, RR 0.16 \[0.04-0.63\] for early treatment.” \[12,13\]

Remember when India was getting devastated by covid? Seems like yesterday. Where did all that news go? Well, there’s this: many Indian states offered Ivermectin to every single adult…\[14\]. What about Africa? Didn’t analysts predict Africa would be a huge covid disaster? Well… a lot of people in Africa actually already take regular doses of Ivermectin for parasitic diseases and these populations show much lower incidents and mortality from sars covid 19.. \[15\] How do you think the covid vaccine market will fare if it has to compete against an over the counter prophylaxis drugs? You do know that the vaccine Emergency Use Authorization for the MRNA vaccine is contingent upon there being no known alternatives to preventing or treating the disease, right? \[16\] That being said, they have applied for full authorization along with Pfizer and will probably get it so this specific point is mostly moot, but still relevant.

So what do you guys think? Seems to me like MRNA is in a bubble and will pop, and the burst could be accentuated by an increasingly competitive market. Love to hear some people who disagree!

2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"How do you catch a sudden price increase/pop in a stock you own to not miss out? Held TLRY from $8 through the $64 pop because I was dumb and thought I had bought in at $24. Still holding ONTX from $0.43 through multiple $15+ pops because I never check it. Held RKT from $20 through $40 because... yeah this one was my own greed.

Question is: What is the best way to catch a sudden pop in a stock so you don't miss out, especially if you aren't managing your portfolio daily? I used to manage my stock profile at least weekly, but even then could miss a single large days gain.

I know how to set up new high or low alerts on E-Trade. Should I just make a ton of tiered alerts for what I own?"
2021-06-02 11:18:51,stocks,"You didn’t miss out on ONTX, trust me. They did a 15:1 reverse split, thus that “pop” you see. It wasn’t a pop, but 15 shares being combined into 1. Everyone is down 70% with ONTX, and I’m about to sell at a loss today. I’m over them, apparently they have a shady history with frequent reverse splits. Definitely something I’ll be looking into as part of my history check when researching my next investment."
2021-06-02 10:42:43,stocks,"You could set sell orders for what you want. Timing the market and trying to maximize returns is challenging if not impossible. Unless you're watching it constantly and moving your sell orders up as the stick climbs, and even then you won't catch them top, you are statistically unlikely to get the top price. Let's say a stock is currently $30 and you bought it for $26. If you have a sell order for $25 and $35 and it drops to 24, then shoots to $80 you miss the top and solid at a loss. If it just shot to $80, you sold for a profit, but still missed the top. At least you profited off that one."
2021-06-02 11:17:09,stocks,I use yahoo finance app and set multiple price alerts for stocks that I have. Low buy target and a high target to check what’s going on.
2021-06-02 18:15:42,stocks,RKT was greed but TLRY wasn’t? You went from $24 (in your head) to $64. That’s an amazing return.

2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,a question on merged stocks I have stocks of Northern Star acquisition corp (STIC). I saw today that stock merged with another stock and named to BARK. My issue is in my investment account i still see STIC and it says they are not priced today (so i can't do anything with them. i.e no sell option). should my STIC stocks automatically named BARK or should i do something?
2021-06-02 12:52:56,stocks,"I made a couple of calls to Fidelity to complain about it.  They blamed it on the clearing house associated with Barkbox being slow to contact them.  They said they would take a paper order to sell if I wanted.  They said it was available to buy.  But my friend with TDAmeritrade said his stocks said BARK this morning.  So, who knows who is the bad guy here!"

2021-06-02 13:38:21,stocks,I don’t recall where but I saw a mention that the change officially happens at 2pm today.  If that’s true that might make sense that some haven’t updated and others did (preemptively?).  Mine is showing options to buy and sell as STIC but it’s shown at the top of my holdings instead of normal alphabetic order so I presume the switch is imminent.
2021-06-02 13:45:01,stocks,It just changed on fidelity at 1:43.  It hadn’t changed at 1:30 when I posted my last reply here.

2021-06-02 09:47:26,stocks,"you should sell during market hours

after hours has much thinner liquidity and larger spreads"
2021-06-02 09:52:43,stocks,"First off you should never place a market order after hours as the volumes are too low and the spreads are too high.  Most brokers will not allow you to do this.  If you want to trade in the after hours market you should always use a limit order.

Second just to clarify a market order is when you say you want to buy/sell at the market price and you will get whatever price someone is willing to pay/take.  This will still be the best possible price but if volume is low and spreads are high it can be quite far from the last price.  For most heavily traded stocks during market hours this is not a problem but you are always safer using limit orders.

If you do place a market order for regular hours before the market opens it will be added to the queue of orders to be resolved at market open.  Depending on how many buy vs sell orders there are the market may open up or down and you will get whatever price the market opens at (not necessarily the same price as the pre-market although that is most likely unless there are lot of pending market orders at open)."

2021-06-02 09:53:44,stocks,Most do but you usually have to opt in due to higher risk.  So you are correct that it is not by default but it really isn't hard to enable.
2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Brokerage Recommendations and Why I want to leave Fidelity One of my holdings has seen a lot of premarket and post market activity recently. For example, one of my holdings was up roughly 20% yesterday, up another 20% in after hours, and up again in premarket this morning - but - in Fidelity I can't see what my gains are outside of 9:30am-4pm, I can only see the value of the stock from 4pm yesterday.  That's at least 8 hours of trading without an update. My wife holds the same stock in Webull, and she gets constant updates on the value of the stock. I would need a calculator to do that.  It's 9:15 AM ET and I still don't see an update, just the 4pm balance. This is ridiculous.

I like fidelity because they are local to me, and I want to help support my local economy. I also like that I can call them and get a rep on the phone if I have an issue. From what I understand support for Webull is pretty much nonexistent. Unfortunately, this issue of not showing the value of my holdings during off hour trading, is turning into a deal breaker for me.

So, I'm looking for a new broker. My criteria:

1. balance updates during pre and post market. I shouldn't need a calculator.
2. A good UI
3. A good mobile app
4. A US broker
5. Tech support availability. If I have a serious enough issue, I will want to speak to a human.
6. Not Thinkorswim, or Robinhood

Any suggestions are welcome."

I read that 80% of the owners of AMC stock are single retail investors.  Some 3+ million people own at least one share of AMC.  The only reason the price is rising, is due to the frenzied buying and selling of the stock amongst the retailers, it has nothing to do with the shorts or a squeeze.  I think the hedge funds who own the stock are just sitting there waiting to make a huge sale.

There was a good suggestion to check the dd on superstonk, I would also suggest you check charlie and the vids, he covers a lot of new documents and filings relating to a smoother process in case OCC and such members default. Furthermore, there is a lot of evidence of market manipulation: SEC chairman confirmed that around 9% of share volume in january were through dark pools, fintel shows millions upon millions of FTDs daily up until april 30 (again, creating synthetic shares), Mudrick capital bought the shares at 4% premium and then announced that they were overvalued??

You just explained it yourself. It's a pump and dump, so people will get burned and sell, and it will go down again. So why cover shorts if it's gonna just go down. Now I'm not saying they did or didn't. But if you think about it, if they didn't cover there's a short squeeze possibility, and if they did cover and it's a pump and dump and it will go down so they didn't need to cover, so they probably didn't cover.

Remember Archegos? Remember 2008? I'm not saying anyone is doing any specific thing, but finance people have often done shady shit because if it just goes away, then they don't even have to cover.

That said, it's impossible to know why the stocks are doing what they are doing, unless you're some kind of whistleblower. With no actual news announced, it could be any number of things, that share correlation but not necessarily causation with all sorts of technical numbers and legal obligations like them ftd cycles and liquidity tests and whatnot."

I actually did buy (and sell) the retail gaming store multiple times, but that was well before WSB unbanned it and briefly hopped on the bandwagon.  

However on the day that Citadel and Vladimir clearly colluded to invoke ""sell only"" mode, I decided to take some of 2020's gains and make a statement buy in support of those being defrauded by the system.  Never, in decades of Wall Street affiliation, have I seen something corrupt and exploitive be so done so brazenly.  

My portfolios are not spectacular, but accredited enough not to be affected when RH and a bunch of other conspirators pulled that stunt.  

I decided to earmark those funds as a write off as my way of supporting those beginning investors who were being mistreated by legacy players.  I fully expected every cent could be lost.

The smart money know this and will likely sell at the inflated prices redditors are currently willing to pay for AMC sometime this week leaving the new Redditor paper millionaires happily bag holding. But when all the Redditors who are going to buy AMC have brought it they have to sell their stock back to the smart money who to their surprise are only willing to pay a fraction of the price redditors were willing to buy at.

The only real winners here are those selling while people are buying at these inflated prices which is probably mostly the institutional investors who held it prior to all the madness. This is why people like roaring kitty made a crap ton of money. He got in before all the redditors pumped up GME and he would have made more if he had sold to them when prices were inflated.

It’s been said a million times on this sub. 

The shorts have not covered. 

There will be a bunch of mini squeezes of other stocks in the basket of shorted stocks.

And GME will likely break the economy. 

Call me a conspiracy theorist if you want. I’ll pay about as much attention to you as I do to flat earthers. Just as the science is clear that the earth is round, so to is the evidence clear that the shorts have not covered. 

This isn’t financial advice. I encourage everybody to make their own decisions. 

So it’s important to understand the full implications of what’s about to happen. A bunch of retail shareholders own the entire available float of GME. These retail investors really like the stock, and view a fair floor as 10 million dollars. 

Now what happens when a computer starts buying every available share of a company at any price possible, and there are no shares listed below $10,000,000? It starts buying them for $10,000,000. 

Whether or not this actually makes it that high is irrelevant. What is relevant is that it appears nobody has any intention of selling any time soon, and DFV had a pretty good quote when asked about his price target. “No target. Just Up.”

In short, you can’t save people from themselves, no matter how hard you try. Those of you who view this as a pump and dump, sucks to suck.

2021-06-02 12:09:50,stocks,"Nah, it's extremely straight-forward.

GME started out as the mother of all short-squeezes, but it has turned into (mostly) a pump and dump.  The short interest on GME has fallen from over 100% just before the first peak to ~21% today.  The *vast majority* of shorts have closed out.  21% is still fairly high, so there's a little juice left to squeeze, but most of the price fluctuation at this point is due to apes pumping and dumping (most of them believing short interest is higher than it is).  

AMC is also ~21% right now which means most of the action on it is also pump.

For some perspective, 21% short interest is still enough to squeeze out a nice kick, but you're never going to get an infinity squeeze that pushes the price up huge multiples.  If GME skies over $400/sh it will be because of retail pump and the biggest losers won't be the hedge funds it will be the retail investors left holding the bag at the end."

2021-06-02 09:17:48,stocks,"Again, I really like RKT. Long term, it should break $100. I think they will give Zillow a run for it’s money as the real estate king.

If it pumps again, like it did 3 months ago, take your profits and get back in when it corrects.

I see no future for the other meme stocks"
2021-06-02 10:52:32,stocks,"The only issue is you can't profit on the ""dump"" because god knows when that actually is. I said to myself that 30 was the top, today it hit 40. I'm not putting any money on it. I use it to bring myself back to reality when I ever think I can predict the market."
2021-06-02 10:31:26,stocks,BB has legs as a company but only at a sensible valuation. It's done nothing major to account for a 50% increase this month and missed its targets in the last results.
2021-06-02 13:23:51,stocks,"> be shorted more than 100%, synthetics have to be created

Can someone explain to me what ""synthetics"" are in this context? Synthetic shares are, to my knowledge, an options strategy that buys calls and puts at the same strike price, and therefore mimics a long position. How does shorting create ""synthetics"" and what are they?"
2021-06-02 11:53:55,stocks,"BA and ""solid financials"" you must be kidding"
2021-06-02 15:12:00,stocks,"A few upticks? Buying GME back in February at 40$ was my best financial move, ever. It's currently at 280$. I have made profits, I'm still holding a large part of my positions, and people still call us bagholders while the stock is flying ? What is wrong with you."
2021-06-02 10:58:08,stocks,How has there not been any actual evidence of naked shorts? Everyone agrees the stock had over 100% short interest at some point. How does that happen without naked shorts? You're not allowed to short the same stock twice.

2021-06-02 15:24:53,stocks,[A literal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DJlogbrDcA) of Jim Cramer talking about manipulating the fuck out of the market when he was a hedge fund manager.
2021-06-02 13:34:25,stocks,this guy really doesn’t think market manipulation exists lmfao
2021-06-02 10:22:44,stocks,"um... its 100% real that the market is corrupted. Not a conspiracy at all. Dark Pool Trading and Naked Shorting show it. The fact that stocks seemingly run crazy once retail sells off. That retail can hold a stock, but the second it sells off. Big buys come in and it runs up, and hedge funds make profit. There is far more proof of their being people in the background make money off of retail traders. Shorting existing in the first place and them not cracking down harder on the people who get together and short, but they will halt stocks from people getting together and pump."

Nice story, because it's true"
2021-06-02 13:26:42,stocks,"AMC theatres I can understand. But if you seriously are gonna turn a blind eye to Gamestop based on reddit salt lords, you should really take a another look. People keep saying this, yet Ryan Cohen keeps delivering. A lot of people are gonna regret not buying Gamestop, it has insane potential."
2021-06-02 14:46:03,stocks,"Ofc gme business model isnt worth even a billion$ now.  

But Ryan cohen himself tho could be worth that much. 

""If you invested in apple 20 years ago, here is what your 1000$ would be worth today"" you know why it's a really interesting clickbait bullshit?

Because purely by fundamentals no one should have invested in apple in the 2000s. Failing business, terrible products(pc that melts within months)but if you invested in Steve jobs you're rich today.

If you invested in bezos, or Bill Gates or Elon you're rich today. 

Ryan isn't anywhere near these giants ofc. But looking at what he did with chewy(which btw, also lookedlike a terrible, terrible investment back in the day)really makes the optimism understandable at least."
2021-06-02 12:01:54,stocks,"Memes and mother of all short squeezes aside, the future of GameStop is ridiculously bright. Ryan Cohen’s leadership, debt paid off early, online sales growth, retail locations being leveraged as individual service centers for same day deliveries, partnership with Microsoft and the sale of PC hardware at their locations, upgrading some of their stores to game lounges to fit the growing trend of “retail as an experience”, and last but probably most important: investment in blockchain technology via NFT. They can use NFTs for digital trade-ins, digital goods, dividends, as a stock alternate, as a cryptocurrency, or for a myriad of other use cases. I know I’ll get downvoted here, but remember when people used to crap on Amazon who was JUST an online book store….

If you are one of the many of us who thought “oh if I had only bought Apple/Amazon/Tesla when it was cheap” then this is your sign. GameStop had no right surviving COVID and the shorts piling on to drive it to bankruptcy, but thanks to deep value investors, new life has been breathed into the company. Even if it doesn’t “squeeze to the moon” (which I personally believe it will) the long term value of GME is insane based off the gaming industry alone. GameStop’s NFT efforts could very well unseat Steam from the gaming marketplace throne.

[GME NFT](https://nft.gamestop.com)"
2021-06-02 12:29:20,stocks,Theaters I agree with you. Gamestop is going to be huge. Ryan has essentially replaced the entire board of out of touch dinosaurs with young go getters that actually know what they are doing.
2021-06-02 18:37:34,stocks,"You are right but looking at it the wrong way. shorts aren't covering because they can't, if they tried closing out of these positions now they would be forced to default, go bankrupt and ultimatly drive the stock price even higher. (these stocks have likely been naked shorted) the hedgies that shorted these stocks aren't doing it to make money anymore, they are doing it to kick the can down the road in hopes of everyone selling so they can keep doing their fuckery."
2021-06-02 17:09:29,stocks,">You have to be a fool to believe this is just a pump & dump. Sure some people are part of it for the pump & dump aspect for sure, but you have to be incredibly naïve to believe there aren't much more complex things going on behind the scenes that have nothing to do with retail investors.

But isn't that just a pump and dump anyway?  It's just the very, very rich people and funds and algos doing the pumping and then the selling off to profit.  After the whales sell off the price will dump by itself, and then if the cult remains those same very, very rich people can just rinse and repeat a few monrhs later."

2021-06-02 11:56:02,stocks,"It's actually quite easy to understand. A bunch of people who got rich by shorting companies into bankruptcy are too stubborn to just actually close their positions after they over extended. They probably thought people would get scared off like most runups. However, the people of WSB have created a culture of people who take risks just for the fun of it, so they're not easy to scare off. 

&#x200B;

TL:DR a community of adrenaline junkies are immune to typical FUD, and the guys betting they would get scared off doubled down."
2021-06-02 13:30:40,stocks,This is the part that *they* don't understand. As an og in that sub (and no longer subscribed for obvious reasons) browsing any weekend thread will tell you that most of the active users and posters are not very wealthy. The amount of talk about people pumping their stimmy checks tells you all you need to know: a sub of sub-$100k/y earners can't put a dent in a stock with the float of gamestock. A single whale can out spend the entire net worth of wsb without draining their margin. Imagine... a whole group of whales? A whole group of hedge funds funded by whales? These are big very numbers.
2021-06-02 16:46:16,stocks,"There are plenty of positives to GME and its turnaround. The shareholder meeting on 9th of june, find out number of votes, probably way more then there should have been, also taking into account that many brokerages around the world would not allow voting of shares, some even charged as much as $150 to vote. No debt, the list is endless, WSB is compromised. r/superstonk and r/GME is where you will find a ton of DD. In my view it is my safest and best stock. I feel comfortable with even when i was deep in the red. Its going to go way further then this price, yes you can remind me of this later.

2021-06-02 15:06:58,stocks,"> How is GME at $250 6 months after the short squeeze?

If you analyze it correctly, it has the fundamentals for it. Valuate it like chewy and bam, you got yourself a ton lot more per share. Scalped amazon and chewy C-suite staff. It's got the potential. The share price didn't get and stay there because of the potential though.

Share price was the ONE thing they used to 100% all wild theories. ""Oh yeah, if lizardmen from planet Xenu are using soy futures to bankrupt companies and it will moon any time now, why's it trading at 1$ dollars?"". With 100+$ for months, you can't deny that SOMETHING is going on anymore.

And purely from data vanguard and blackrock loaded up on gme ages ago for whatever reason we can't mindread and hodled like the craziest redditor."
2021-06-02 15:49:29,stocks,Shorts never covered. GameStop not a meme stock.
2021-06-02 17:48:04,stocks,"GME had an actual business case for its price. It was being shorted to hell, In order to close up shop. But this week and the week prior has been a pump for sure. Youtubers left and right have been cooking this thing for months on end. (Ex. Matt Kors, Meet Kevin, Treys Trade.) 

All they needed was for a little bit of momentum to break the major resistance point, and that a squeeze is possible, to create enough FOMO and get everyone to pump it as high as they can. 

Well there ain't a squeeze, or else it would've happened already. This is pure FOMO volume buying and pushing the stock up for no reason other than hype based on absolutely nothing but youtubers collaborating together to create this fake narrative. Everyone is taking advantage of this at this point. And if any big hedge funds were shorting it, they most likely had tons of time to cover and lock in a strategy to make massive gains on the way down."

You then pass a mere couple million to the right people at market manipulation trials will once again find some rando.

2021-06-02 09:31:18,stocks,"The dump happens when the big money sells.  That is the dump on pump and dump.  You buy low pump up the value and then sell.  Pump and dump has nothing to do with shorting.  Pump and dumpers don't care if the price stays high or not.  All they care about is pushing a stock way up and then selling for profit.  The fact is usually when all the big money sells the price crashes and the small fish who bought the pump and dump lose out.  

For the record I am not saying meme stocks are pump and dumps but they are acting like it."
2021-06-02 11:30:58,stocks,You profit on the dump by selling the stocks you bought before the pump.  The stock does not have to go back down for the pumper  to make money.  You are confusing pump and dumpers with short sellers.  The reason pump and dump is so dangerous is usually after the pump is done and the pumper sells there is nothing left to hold up the price so it falls back down to where the pump started.  As long as others keep buying in the stock will stay up but the pumper still made their money.  Eventually though the buyers will run out if the fundamentals don't match and it will eventually fall.  As we have seen no one can predict when that will happen especially when others continue to keep pumping the stock.
2021-06-02 12:25:35,stocks,And now it's almost $60 as of this moment...
2021-06-02 11:59:50,stocks,There is plenty of ways to profit for a dump as long as you aren't expecting quick money.
2021-06-02 13:39:26,stocks,"It jumped to $72 like 10 minutes ago and I sold, after buying in at 30 2 days ago. Almost $6k straight profit. You can sit on the sidelines but if you put a little skin in the game you might find the risk worth it."

2021-06-02 13:30:55,stocks,"When you short a stock you effectively borrow a share and sell it on a market. To borrow it, you must first find a lender. However, it is ""expensive"" for firms to find a shareowner who would lend (literally the explanation I found while looking at historic fines for naked shorting), and so sometimes, especially in heavily shorted companies, hedge funds do whats called naked shorting, where they do not find the shares that they shorted which results in a failure to deliver stock (they sell a stock which they do not have, effectively creating a new share out of thin air) - this dilutes the share volume, lowering the price, on top of providing selling pressure on a stock. Hedge funds do this (short excessively) especially with struggling companies so that they cant get any value from issuing more shares without completely diluting the share count, making it hard for them to raise money. If a company goes bankrupt as a result, the hedge funds dont have to ""cover"" their shorts."
2021-06-02 15:45:31,stocks,"This works for stocks too, but lets take banks as an example (though they have different rules how to create synthetics).

You give bank 10 dollars. Bank loans me those 10 bucks. I give these 10 bucks to you. You put these 10 bucks in the bank too. Now you ""have"" 20 bucks in the bank, but there's only 10 real bucks. These are synthetics. Now, banks have laws how much and exactly how they can do this.

Shorting stocks as you know is borrowing. But what if you borrowed again without giving back? Synthetic shares. Now, what if the tendieman come and ask ""did you really borrow this many shares?"". Well, you didn't, and you don't want to pay to actually buy any shares back, so you employ options strategy, and it mimics long position. You show the tendieman ""yes sir, see here, long positions, yes sir"". In reality you didn't buy any long positions, you didn't spend any amount of money a long position would make you spend, you didn't move the market up by buying, and you can now dump these options or let them expire or whatever. Great job, you've kicked the can down the road until the next time Gary Gensler comes looking."

2021-06-02 11:06:01,stocks,"Yes you are.  Naked shorts are shorting a stock without borrowing.  Normal shorting requires you to borrow the stock first.  Normal shorting still creates synthetic shares which is how short interest gets over 100%.

Person A buy 100 shares of ABC

Person S borrows those 100 shares from Person A and sells them to person B

Person S now borrows those same shares from person B (person A holds synthetic shares now) and sells them to person C.

Person A now holds 100 synthetic shares of ABC

Person B now holds 100 synthetic shares of ABC

Person C now holds 100 real shares of ABC

Person S now has 200 shares short of ABC and did not naked short anything as they borrowed the shares properly and legally.

The short interest is now 200% as there are 200 shares short on 100 shares float with 200 synthetic shares also being created."

2021-06-02 10:54:45,stocks,"Exactly. Some people are just too gullible...

Just as an example, I checked Yahoo finance the other day for one of my stocks that is heavily being targeted by short sellers and there were FIFTY EIGHT separate articles about some (supposedly bogus) class action lawsuit that was announced in March and still not filed in the past two months, and they all contained the exact same information. Basically one news item every day. If you don't think that's coming from some short seller's ""marketing campaign"" to manipulate the market I don't think anything will convince you. And that's just some small stock, imagine what's going on with companies like GME and AMC.

It just makes zero sense. 

Like a game lounge is supposed to motivate me to go in store rather than just trade in with Amazon online? How does that empty waste of retail space make them any money?

21% short interest isn't covered, but it's not high enough for an infinity squeeze.  The NYSE publishes short sales once a month - and 21% was reported.  This system has been in place since long before GME and will continue on long after.  You don't have to believe the number if you don't want.  You're welcome to believe whatever pleases you.

Lower short interest also doesn't mean the stock can't have a meteoric rise - it just means it's not going to happen from a short squeeze.  Pump and Dumps are timeless and you can make a lot of money on them as long as you're not the one left holding the bag when the music stops."

That said, I don't see how this could be legal. Why isn't there some system that makes sure that once a share is shorted, it can never be shorted again. Surely it should be possible to create a system that flags shares #1 through 100 as shorted and therefore person S would not be able to borrow those same shares again from whoever they sold them to."

If you need to make the point possibly fake news being put out repetitively to manipulate price, in my opinion you’re naive for even questioning that, as it’s a fact. There’s a big grey area on what is legal or not legal on sharing news / rumour and they push that to the limit. Pump and dump exists, the opposite exists with shorting, always has, always will, that’s how the game is played and bitching about it gets no one anywhere. People stupid enough to buy into this stuff should learn to do their own due diligence and not take other people’s word as fact.

2021-06-02 14:55:53,stocks,"I respectfully disagree with your opinion, and wish you luck in your investments. I’m not trying to convince anyone to buy GME, just simply defending my position. I think you underestimate the potential of having a small network of retail locations that can serve as same day fulfillment centers, and double as a store front (think UPS Stores). 

I also think you underestimate the transition to experience-based retail. The prevalence and success of e-commerce is a byproduct of stagnation in traditional B&M locations. Why go out and get the product from a store, when I can have it shipped to my house for free? This mode of thinking shifts when the store offers an experience that you cannot get online. As someone who worked in the theme park industry, I can tell you that we intricately themed our stores and provided live entertainment and story lines in order to sell an experience. Sure we could just shove a ton of wands in a store with four walls and call it a day, but the story telling experience and immersion is what makes guests pay $50+ for a piece of molded resin. I think GameStop creating lounges allows them to pick strategic locations that will cater to that “experience”, while still retaining its traditional stores as guerilla fulfillment centers for its push in e-commerce. They want you to buy online, but they also want you to come into their new locations and join tournaments, socialize, rent out party spaces, pay per hour game, etc. it’s simply diversification of revenue streams. I see it as them having their cake and eating it too.

And you’re right, nothing is to stop competitors from using NFTs as well. But in terms of revolutionary (as opposed to evolutionary) technological leaps, the first-player advantage is huge.

I personally speculate that it will be worth $1000+ based on fundamentals in a few years time, so to me, buying right now (even at its inflated price) is a no-brainer."

Add on hedge funds with reddit sentiment bot trading and you have so much 'instant' massive capital moving on each frenzy.

And then there's institutions that look at this and decide to short. Then other institutions notice this and drive price more. Basically leading to a circle fest.

Price goes up? Some shorts cover but new shorts come in. etc. etc. One big pile of circle mess. Price goes down? New shorts come in and new buyers come in (old sellers/covers go out).

&#x200B;

Companies like Gamestop only has like 70 million shares out there. A huge chunk of which is locked up due to index funds and all. Only 57 million are public float so if there's 25 million shares locked up in 'buy and hold' out of that public float, it's just going to drive the share price up to ridiculous levels cause there's only 32 million shares out there (many of which that gets locked up by ITM calls). Very extreme supply and demand. Plus, it's not like all 57 million floats are being traded at any given moment.

Then there's hedge funds trying to 'compete' against other hedge funds and using these meme stocks to do so might work very well when there's enough belief about retail investors joining and holding regardless of price. And then all this volatility brings in day traders too. And those day traders again short/buy. Who knows what's actually going on with this stock at this point especially with foreigners buying up the same stock too (again, limited supply and huge demand).

It's called overvoting. Apparently it happens in 50-100% all shareholder votes? There's a big lawyer who specializes in these, he did an interview on superstonk. 

And yes, overvoting can be used to sue hedgies who caused it, and by sueing you can dig up more documents, and prove other stuff like illegal naked shorting etc. 

This is what is expected in GME shareholder meeting in 7 days and why the ""apes"" are yelling at everyone to vote with their shares.

If the vote amount is reasonably aligned it doesn't exactly ""do"" anything. It doesn't disprove anything, it just doesn't prove that there were extra shares becaue it's also possible shareholders didn't vote.

The officially reported short interest is still extremely high (the VW squeeze which x5 its price occured with 12% SI, and there wasn't even so much FOMO and options activity around that stock), as for the shorts reported in that link I added, it's even bigger. Hence, the short squeeze thesis would not be affected. However, I'm most certain that there is a crap ton of synthetic shares, which is a cherry on top. You are right, you get voting rights, as it doesnt matter if you bought a share from a naked short seller or someone genuinely owning the stock, and so this share recount, which will take place starting today and will probably take a few weeks at least will give us a better picture of HOW many synthetic shares there really are. The hedge funds would probably be forced to buy back a certain number of shares from the market to eliminate the excess of shares."
2021-06-02 12:29:10,stocks,"It is legal because it is assuming the market will correct itself eventually (which it did with the short squeeze which bankrupted at least one hedge fund in Melvin Capital).  At any point person A or B could have refused to loan out their shares.  Person A or B could recall their shares.  This is just the market at work.  Contrary to what you may hear on other sites short sellers can never actually bankrupt a company.  The worst thing that happens to a company being shorted is that it is harder for them to raise additional capital by issuing more shares.  If the company is actually successful and profitable they could start buying back their own shares at a huge discount which would also put pressure on the short sellers as that would decrease the float and increase the price which would increase the chances of a short squeeze.  They could also issue a dividend which the short seller would have to pay out to the people they borrowed the shares from increasing the cost of holding the short position.

What we saw in GME is an aberration where too many shorts piled into a company that they thought had not future,  Others noticed the precarious position that put them in and a squeeze occurred.  As far as I can see the meme stocks are now worth more than they would have been without all of the shorting and the ensuing squeeze.  The only problem now is that people are greedy and want it to go higher and are insisting it would be higher if only there wasn't this imaginary corruption and illegal activity.  The problem is that many people who don't know better are believing them and thinking that the game is rigged and corrupt which is a dangerous mindset when there has been no actual evidence of illegal behavior. 

One of the most famous quotes about the market is ""the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent"".  That cuts both ways.  The markets were irrational for a long time when the shorts were making money and now they are irrational by staying so high after the squeeze.  Eventually meme stocks will go back to trading on fundamentals but when that happens is anyone's guess.  I personally am not betting on or against them just watching the show and trying to help people who don't know any better for falling for misinformation.  If I am correct at some point the meme stocks are going to come down and it is going to be retail investors that lose out."

If individuals with other brokers were not, that’s suggestive of a broker issue, not an exchange issue per se. I have seen no evidence of an exchange issue.

As to the shorts > 100% of outstanding shares - this is extremely simple, and legal. The person buying the share from the shorter is free to lend it out themselves. Thus the ‘same’ share can be shorted twice.

Do I think shorts should be legal? No. I don’t. I think they’re not necessary for a market to efficiently supply capital to businesses in need of investment. In my opinion it should be 100% illegal to lend shares of any listed company. But the fact is, today, this activity is legal. Those are the rules of the game.

2021-06-02 16:05:22,stocks,"The reason gme and meme stonks even started, was because at, what, 4 dollars something, gme was not fairly valuated based on fundamentals. It had the cash, it weathered covid thanks to old CEO by curbside pickup and stuff, it did a massive buyback, and that's why DFV valued it. Not from 4$ to infinity, just, you know, higher than 4$. And the short interest thing was only about ""the only reason the stock is below 20$ for example, is not because it's doing bad or everyone's selling, it's just being shorted"". The original investment wasn't about the squeeze, but about the fundamentals. It's just once everyone piled in, it also squoze on top of that.

Think about it, it sold 3 million shares and has enough just cash, just from that alone, to be 20-25$ cash per share. If you bought at 4$ just that cash value alone is 500-600% increase. Talk about fundamentals."

A) He didn't know that short interest was sky high on GME when he bought it.

Papes holding doesn't create or sustain volume, but it narrows the float, so smaller volume can achieve same price movement, and if price moves then options traders have to buy to hedge, that's more buying, that's more price increases, that's more hedging, that's more margin calls, more volume."

&#x200B;

**On Wednesday, the movie theater chain launched a new portal on its website just for its retail investors. The site, which requires stockholders to self-identify and sign-up for the chain’s loyalty program, contains “special offers” and company updates.**

One of those special offers is a free tub of popcorn.

AMC’s retail investors have [propped up company since January](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/amcs-ceo-wants-to-use-the-meme-frenzy-as-a-springboard-for-growth.html), sending the stock up more than 1,400% in the last five months. Shares were up more than 20% in premarket trading Wednesday. 

The company said it had 3.2 million individual shareholders as of March 11, who own about 80% of the 450 million shares outstanding. Many of them were inspired by the r/wallstreetbets Reddit page to purchase the stock. The forum selected several companies that were being shorted by large hedge fund groups and decided to take action.

CEO Adam Aron has praised these investors for their support. The company delayed its annual shareholders meeting by more than a month in order to give these investors an opportunity to attend the event and “make their important voices heard.”

Aron and AMC both plan to [donate $50,000 to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/amc-ceo-adam-aron-raved-about-its-reddit-investors-on-an-earnings-call.html) — a clear nod to these new investors, who call themselves apes and refer to Aron as “Silverback.” AMC also has shifted its communication style to speak directly with shareholders via social media, including YouTube. Aron has even taken a renewed interest in Twitter, “following” hundreds of accounts tied to the “ape army.”

AMC Investor Connect is the next step in the company’s strategy of connecting with these investors. The platform provides shareholders with exclusive promotions, like free or discounted items and invitations to special screenings, as well as direct communications with Aron.

“During my five-plus year tenure as CEO at AMC, I’ve taken great pride in the relationships I have forged with AMC’s owners,” Aron said in a statement Wednesday**. “With AMC Investor Connect, that effort in relationship building will continue apace even if our shareholders now number in the millions. After all, these people are the owners of AMC, and I work for them.”**"

Following the GME, AMC and BB   gains we saw this year, I think some executives are realizing the influence of retail investors on stocks.

AMC might be the first one, but other corporations might follow its steps and give more attention to retail investors. A good marketing strategy to target retail investors could be a game changer in the market.

Edit : following a lot of comments, I would like to make my point clear. I do not care about the free movie tickets or the popcorn. I am talking about how much attention the executives at AMC are giving to retail investors. The fact that the shareholders meeting will be hold on YouTube (if I understood correctly), they say they want a bigger presence on social medias to share information to their investors, etc. That is what I am saying could be a game changer in the market. The more attention and care you give to your retail investors, the more attractive you will be to them"

Business gonna business.

EDIT: to add, if the perks are good enough, you might actually get a situation where most AMC stock is held by AMC customers. And that's actually quite an awesome thing. Ultimately, ROI does not have to be expressed in dividends and stock buybacks. Why not buy shares in companies you like just to get perks?"
2021-06-02 08:29:54,stocks,"AMC is an entertainment company that makes its money from as many members of the public showing up to watch movies as possible. The whole squeeze/retail investor hype thing is likely the best advertising possible for them in a pandemic when everybody might otherwise have stopped thinking about them entirely. I think Adam Aron understands that the retail investors are also the customer - and more retail investors = more customers.

As far as why give out a free ticket and popcorn? Theaters make money from concessions. The free ticket is a loss leader and the popcorn is meant to make you thirsty. Likewise, making the retail/reddit investors happy = more free advertising on Reddit, because even people who aren't invested in AMC are going to see articles like this and think, ""cool!""

I'm not saying any of that is a bad thing - it's  a very savvy business choice that I think speaks highly of AMC's management team's ability to help the company benefit from a very unique series of events."

2021-06-02 08:46:40,stocks,"Not SUS at all.  Some of the cruise line stocks offer perks.  It really is in their interest.  For example Royal Caribbean gives stock holders a $100 on board credit.  You are spending money booking the cruise to get the onboard credit.  So for AMC, you buy the ticket to watch the movie to get a free bucket of popcorn.  Pretty smart to keep people as stock holders."

2021-06-02 09:01:03,stocks,Investor perks are not a new thing.  All 3 of the major cruise lines will give you a free $100 on board credit for any cruise you go on if you own at least 100 shares.  I am curious if there is a minimum number of shares you have to own for your free popcorn.  It is good public relations and it keeps people holding not trading their stock.  Also you probably have to buy a ticket to get your free popcorn so think of it more as a coupon to encourage more business and they can probably write it off as a marketing expense.
2021-06-02 09:00:13,stocks,"You are asking a bunch of stupid ass people who actually own this stock. 

>Why are they doing this?

They all got huge bonuses and keep diluting the stock on the backs of these dumb buyers. So now they are throwing them some popcorn to keep them around, and no popcorn is not better than having a good business that pays dividends - cost of popcorn production is like what, under a dollar? 

Anyway, imo this stock is trash and people are getting played, amc was around 7 to 8 bucks pre pandemic, nothing has made it worth 5x that now. If anything they are worse off and worth even less now because of how movies have shifted to also coming out via streaming."

2021-06-02 14:30:03,stocks,"I have a bitter-sweet story. I bought 200 at $10ish per share, then bought another 100 at $19 per share

then I saw it hit $33 then immediately drop to $25, so I sold like the coward I am

after seeing it rebound to $27, I decided I wasn't gonna be a coward and bought back in all 300 again, but decided to ""play it safe"" and set a limit to sell if it dropped below a certain value

problem is, I'm an idiot, and didn't read what I was doing, and accidentally sold all shares... again.

Now, the thing is, etrade only lets you sell so many times a day. So now I was stuck, unable to re-purchase those stocks i had just bought back. So I wait... and wait... and wasn't able to buy back until it soared up to $40 a share :'("

2021-06-02 11:22:49,stocks,I can relate. I had 200 shares because I bought really early. It was my first more volatile stock so once I had made a small-ish profit a few months ago  I jumped out because I was tired of keeping up with it. Now I'm feeling the pain lmfao. I could have half of my student loans paid off :') Woops.
2021-06-02 13:06:44,stocks,"I also sold out at a loss because I'd just started and wanted to play with penny stocks so I freed up the money after it dipped. 

I knew it would bounce back up from where it was and had every intention of buying back in, but theatres opened up weeks earlier than I expected and the price bounced back up to $10+ immediately so I just moved on with my life.

Never expected it to go as crazy as it has, I thought that was pretty unique to GME. Ah well.

Still confident in the stocks I did buy, they're moving up slow and steady. :)"

2021-06-02 09:39:21,stocks,The article.
2021-06-02 09:27:38,stocks,"Yeah same way I see it. 

Also options are so expensive i think they barely even moved relative to the stock yesterday, just not worth playing either way for me. 1000 other stocks out there."
2021-06-02 11:37:22,stocks,Not a cult btw
2021-06-02 11:49:47,stocks,"The ones that are happy have already sold and exited their position. But do continue to hold forever if you think this stock is gonna be 100 EOY. It's going to drop back down. It's in meme territory and and doesn't deserve It's current valuation, no stock that rises that fast unorganically is gonna hold that value."
2021-06-02 09:38:51,stocks,"What do I need to get a grip on. I don't give a shit if amc goes up or down. I just dont get calling them bagholders at the moment when they are outperforming most stocks right now. The op's bagholding joke would have been funny if amc announced the free popcorn just after the stock tanks from 40 to 10, but it's just not the case at the moment"
2021-06-02 10:55:08,stocks,I would love to see your DD supporting your theory. Oddly enough there seems to be a lot of people concerned about my money while offering me no evidence that I should worry.
2021-06-02 08:34:16,stocks,"Ah yes, the old 400% bull trap.  I'm sorry you sold too..."
2021-06-02 10:13:09,stocks,"The ""Hodl"" community can be really special sometimes and don't know when it's smart to cash out and take earnings."
2021-06-02 11:47:40,stocks,Because it's a cult
2021-06-02 11:07:02,stocks,"The issue here is the dump part.  Pumping...maybe(aka buying a stock I like?). Dumping, no.  Welcome to the new wall street.  Where the little guys now have all of the power and the ""smart"" money is looking dumber everyday.  You are more than welcome to act as if it is 2004 though.  We will happily accept your money."
2021-06-02 08:29:47,stocks,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is what an incel looks like on reddit."
2021-06-02 08:42:39,stocks,Why you mad at your girlfriend's boyfriend
2021-06-02 10:47:33,stocks,Nope.  Those were shares already available.
2021-06-02 14:57:36,stocks,"A single… let’s say $.60 per film for every shareholder who puts ass in seat otherwise seems like a decent trade off. If everyone invested $40 now, and AMC paid $.60 per film in concession “giveaways,” they would guarantee huge capital upfront with a minimal cut in profit margin. Shareholders would have to see 40+ films to make their share price back in popcorn. That’s 40+ films AMC has the chance to upsell on a drink and other concessions. I really don’t see a negative here. But I have an open mind and would love to be shown what that is… would help me be a better critical thinker, so please help a girl out."
2021-06-02 08:41:35,stocks,"Well he hasn’t done multiple massive share offerings to get himself a bonus like AMC so he’s already doing better. They killed the squeeze back in January with an offering so they’d get $400 mil in bonuses. 

AMC execs do not care about their retail investors, they think they’re idiots they can fleece."
2021-06-02 08:40:18,stocks,"Ah sorry my bad, didn't read correctly"
2021-06-02 08:51:33,stocks,Why? They aren't competing.
2021-06-02 10:26:22,stocks,They have a yearly rough revenue of 7.1 million with next to no liabilities and 18.5 million in assets. 50 grand isn't nothing but the majority of their funding comes from steady government sources.
2021-06-02 08:53:50,stocks,But it’s 1 share? Do people seriously have to contemplate what to do with $30?
2021-06-02 08:54:11,stocks,Your investing strategy needs to be depositing more money into your brokerage account
2021-06-02 09:52:07,stocks,dude its 40 bucks ... you made 20 bucks in 6 months lmao what the fuck is that strategy
2021-06-02 11:45:43,stocks,If your investing strategy consists on buying stocks that will quickly double you're gonna end up with nothing eventually. Getting lucky one times doesn't mean the next one doesn't tank on you. The entire point of the big payoff with these meme stocks is also the risk you're taking that it could all crash on you instead.
2021-06-02 13:22:31,stocks,$60
2021-06-02 17:49:20,stocks,">I make money baby

LMAO 🤡

Remindme! 2 months"
2021-06-02 12:53:09,stocks,Nice. I just sold my 20 shares at $55 so Im off the coaster. Best of luck
2021-06-02 12:45:53,stocks,And THATS how ya ruin a short squeeze
2021-06-02 13:10:10,stocks,Off topic but how do you like chase investing I’m thinking of switch to it so I can have everything in one.
2021-06-02 13:16:20,stocks,Did the same today - covered my initial investment and now I’m just watching the house money grow
2021-06-02 15:32:18,stocks,Hey man a good rule is if it’s good enough to screen shot it’s good enough to sell
2021-06-02 14:36:41,stocks,"Ouch. Yeah you can't sell, then buy, then sell, then buy again in a short period with unsettled funds from the original sell. I think every broker does that. Shit happens"
2021-06-02 15:57:08,stocks,Paper handed papi
2021-06-02 16:35:41,stocks,Those are the consequences of having paper hands.
2021-06-02 18:14:26,stocks,"Yeah, would be considered as day trading. Which I believe requires 25K Margin account."
2021-06-02 19:47:57,stocks,You’ll be happy to know it’s at 66 per share after hours
2021-06-02 13:23:15,stocks,I had a $12 call last week that I sold at $15. Shouldve executed lol
2021-06-02 14:04:02,stocks,"ha same. Can't be mad at yourself for taking gains too. Also, you only missed out on $50-ish. I sold 33 GME at 185 last week so missed out on about 3300 but still more than doubled my money so no complaints from me. Cost basis was $50 though. I take it in stride"
2021-06-02 15:15:59,stocks,Nah. I'll stay neutral and just see what happens. I couldnt even short it if I wanted because I refuse to subject my account to the risk so I will never enable margin
2021-06-02 13:22:02,stocks,"I bet you are, severe mental whipping!!"
2021-06-02 11:54:25,stocks,Could always buy more. It has solid momentum.
2021-06-02 11:22:56,stocks,It was a lot of money for me and I wasn't willing to risk it when for the first time in months I wasn't in the red from AMC.
2021-06-02 11:56:15,stocks,"I bought 1800 shares around $8-$10, and still holding. For those with 💎🙌 the promised land is soon. I kick myself for not pulling the trigger when it was $4.50 and having double the shares. These guys here bemoaning their decision will do it far worse after the MOASS. Everyone should buy back in now."
2021-06-02 11:36:23,stocks,It is.
2021-06-02 12:35:43,stocks,Even if you want to sell 100 shares you might as well sell a covered call. Make some extra with the premium and you can try rolling it if it skyrockets.
2021-06-02 18:51:12,stocks,Thanks.
2021-06-02 12:25:42,stocks,">It's a logical assumption based on how being a shareholder in any company works

No it's not lol. For example, to get the Ford discount, you must own 100 shares. You have to sign up through AMC's investor relations site so they'll know how much you own and whether it meets their requirements."
2021-06-02 15:12:10,stocks,Ehh make your own individual comment next time
2021-06-02 09:11:17,stocks,"I mean, got to elect out where possible. Can't really take a fish and redistribute to 100 investors, and can't have the manager take as extra comp.

Throwing in the closet would make the office reak of fish, so conundrum."
2021-06-02 18:03:06,stocks,"If you work for a company the has fleet vehicles, ask around at hr. My husband works in the oilfield and got a 10k discount."
2021-06-02 12:25:52,stocks,That's interesting. Did not know that but unfortunately just bought a car
2021-06-02 12:00:24,stocks,Need to pick up some seals and penguins at PetStop
2021-06-02 17:09:01,stocks,"Yeah. I was looking at it during the pandemic shitshow, was trading super low where the discount would have been a good % off if you use a couple times.

Edit: was carnival, not royal carribean. 100 shares as well, was $250 off 14 day cruise and it was trading like 13-15 / share when I was looking at it. July IIRC. 100 shares at $15 for like $1500 total and $250 discount actually was a pretty ok deal. Even at $30ish today not a terrible deal."
2021-06-02 12:50:07,stocks,"for anyone wondering, the current ford share price is $14.77, so it's a matter of spending around $1477 right now in order to access the discount (regardless of whether or not it actually saves you money in the end)

according to [this blog](https://blog.fosketts.net/2012/05/21/ford-xplan-pricing-shareholders/), the discount is as follows:

>Dealer Invoice - (0.4% * Dealer Invoice) + $275 Administration Fee

if we assume that you only need to spend $1477 on those shares, then you'll need an invoice of around $50k to save a little bit of money (less than $300 @ $50k invoice)"
2021-06-02 10:20:32,stocks,"It's roughly invoice price, you can let family members use the deal,  and 12 months later you can do it again.

Don't tell the dealer you're using the plan until you're closing, or he'll stick you a model or unit with the lowest markup or sellability."

2021-06-02 15:36:28,stocks,"Nope.  The smart move is to hold, wait for it to peak. THEN sell, wait for it to settle, and buy back in ... for tubs of popcorn 🍿 when you go."

2021-06-02 12:06:40,stocks,"That is the sensible thing to do. As you said they don't even need to profit as a business, they can just put in index funds. But they have to play it smart in order to not spook retail. I think that's what the AMC mgmt is doing. Small batches of shares are created every now and then. They know if they suddenly issued double the float the price would spike down."

2021-06-02 10:59:12,stocks,"If it’s the only step… yeah it’s trash. 

If it’s a step in the direction that customers will have a more direct impact on the actual company’s decisions…. You have the opportunity to sacrifice profit to build a relationship with a customer.

That’s something that almost every single company has abandoned in the 21st century. And it’s usually not even the actual company and their employees benefitting from cutting corners, changing recipes, outsourcing support, using cheaper parts… it benefits investors, especially hedge funds.

If this isn’t an empty gesture you can get to a point where ambitious decisions from the top that fail are even forgiven because the investors love the company. A mentality usually only reserved for startups and passion project businesses"
2021-06-02 09:50:22,stocks,Shoulda gotten in early :p
2021-06-02 10:16:02,stocks,"I mean price will inevitably tank again soon as it did last time this happened. And the price falls cause more people are selling than buying, but the people selling at the top as it falls are selling to somebody who's now holding bags. And since this will be over soon it really will be AMC offering free popcorn to the bagholders, since those who were smart and sold at the top will no longer be AMC investors."
2021-06-02 08:35:30,stocks,I sold last time it hit 30 but thanks for your concern

2021-06-02 09:33:51,stocks,"When you believe your stock is overvalued, you should absolutely raise capital by issuing/selling equity ASAP.

AMC execs care about the growth of the business, retail investors care about making money. They're definitely making the right decision here. They just raised $230M yesterday at absurd valuations that they're going to use for acquisitions.

That's the response of a solid (or even just common sense) management team."
2021-06-02 11:09:45,stocks,Genuine question.  Can you explain why you think the squeeze is killed off?
2021-06-02 13:14:54,stocks,I stand corrected.  Thank you.
2021-06-02 10:34:53,stocks,My investment strategy is fine lol the money I use for that strategy is the built up uninvested money that's left over in the account.

2021-06-02 12:42:55,stocks,"yes it is lol. The ceo never specified anything and the promotional offer was just announced today so the assumption until more information out there of ""one or more"" is logical and based on how being a shareholder works in any company that offers perks to people holding one or more shares, regardless of what ford offers. They clearly leaned towards the ""...or more"" part of the assumption."

2021-06-02 17:53:10,stocks,I think you give AMC too much credit. They literally doubled the float in one week a few months ago. They've diluted almost 4x since the start of the year. I've seen comparisons to GME but I think that is unwarranted. GME didn't dilute at all through most of the crazy run-up.

I would never sell the first drop, there's always ppl taking profits or skips in the price like when the halted it today. Jumped to 60 they halted, dropped to 50 and is now back over 60. If you sold a correction like that you'd be really sad."

2021-06-02 11:14:25,stocks,"Might not be dead, can’t blame anyone for shorting AMC again after the first squeeze and offerings since it was trading several times over its prepandemic value. But those original shorts covered during the first squeeze, whatever is happening now is from more recent shorts which make up a much smaller percentage of the float (due to dilution) which degrades the potential of the squeeze. I haven’t looked into the current short numbers but even during the first squeeze it was only like 30% compared to GME’s 100+%"

2021-06-02 15:11:30,stocks,"If you buy in now you’re buying for the probable squeeze that is going to happen. I believe it will go well into the thousands per share as hedge funds have to hedge against their losses and buy back all the shares they have shorted. We haven’t seen something like this before. You have millions of people refusing to sell, waiting for life changing money. The buy pressure is insane. Now imagine how high it will go when the hedge funds need to buy back millions of shares to cover their shorts, while competing with retail, FOMO buyers, and institutions. The crazy thing is they haven’t even really started that yet according to Ortega data. This is all organic buying pressure. 

The floor on the AMC sub is $100k - $500k a share. I’m not saying it can go that high or not, but no one really knows because this is a new and unique situation. But if you have millions of people refusing to sell with those big numbers in mind, and retail holds 80%+ of the shares, who the hell knows how high it can go."

But the biggest thing imo is how every couple weeks or so you see a new headline about poor conditions in some Amazon worker space. And given their huge market cap I don’t think they do enough to give back to communities but that’s another topic.

2021-06-02 12:05:53,stocks,"They may not have, but I don’t see why they would have held on this long, it’s only rational for them to bow out post-offering since their position was so far underwater even after the price fell back to ~$5. 

See the problem with short interest data is it doesn’t tell you where the shorts entered the position just the total short interest. As shorts are margin called and forced to cover at the top an equal number can enter a short position, the SI percent stays unchanged but the dynamics are radically different as the new shorts remain profitable, or at least aren’t in danger of being margin called. Those post offering shorts are now certainly getting margin called, but how high can they take the price while covering? There’s plenty of float for them to cover with, and while it is probably causing a gamma squeeze it’s still only going to have so much of an effect, the rest has to come from investors buying up bags at or near the top. The myth that retail controls the float of AMC or GME is just that, a myth, there are millions of shares being traded each day as people sell. There’s no solidarity, people are taking profits every minute of the day. 

Now it is possible short sellers get greedy (they don’t seem to be learning their lesson on meme stocks) and continue to short at what they think is the top and continually get margin called as it climbs higher but even still there’s a limit to how long that can continue for and there’s diminishing returns as short interest will fall as risk continues to increase. There’s just not enough short sellers willing to burn their money staying in their positions, they will cut their losses, easily cover, then either move on or reshort after the steam runs out. They’ve been watching how meme stocks cycle just like the rest of us."

Right, that's the problem. It's profits over everything. I get that it's a for-profit business, but the point is straightforward: **they make boatloads of money, but don't fairly invest it into the people who enable the business.** It shouldn't take a hit to the bottom line in order to improve things, especially when the company has more than enough money to do so. [Hell, they've even lost a lawsuit for wage theft.](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-settles-8-million-wage-theft-lawsuit-contract-delivery-drivers-2021-3) The chances of them *not* stealing from other employees, at this very second, are incredibly low.

Amazon has been in the news for poor working conditions for years, but nothing seems to improve at a meaningful level. [They even went as far as denying that the problem exists, when plenty of employees on the front lines can confirm that the problem has persisted to this day.](https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1374911222361956359?lang=en) 

[Let's not even get into the sheer stupidity on their part regarding the AmaZen program for overworked employees.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx5nmw/amazon-introduces-tiny-zenbooths-for-stressed-out-warehouse-workers) Just pay your people more and/or decrease their quotas."

2021-06-02 06:59:34,stocks,Correct.  Or if you dont have the 100k or dont want to own the shares you can just sell the option before it expires.  The options themselves are going to be profitable without going down the path of buying the shares.  Majority of options contracts just get traded and are never exercised to buy or sell shares.
2021-06-02 07:05:25,stocks,"You can let it expire, you would lose the price you paid to initially buy those options contracts.  

If you paid $2 per contract for example, you would have spend $2 X 100 shares per contract X 100 contracts = $20,000."
2021-06-02 07:01:40,stocks,"ok perfect, thanks a lot !"
2021-06-02 07:01:02,stocks,and if i don’t sell it before it expires do i loose or gain anything without exercising it ?
2021-06-02 07:09:48,stocks,ok thanks a lot for all your answers !
2021-06-02 07:08:44,stocks,No.  Either sell it while its active/before expiration or exercise and buy the shares.  If you let it expire and do nothing with it then you’ve pissed away all tht profit.
2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Thought process behind profitable stocks right now With an unprejudiced unbiased view of the market and narrowing down on stocks to trade, how does one land on the profitable stock at the moment to trade?
May be an obvious question to ask, but rather than trading just the tickers you like for private reasons what sentiment, statistics, market knowledge do you use to locate a sector - more specifically a stock in that sector - that would be profitable in the near future?"
2021-06-02 07:06:36,stocks,"1. Identify themes sectors you are interested in, or develop a bias towards. 2.Conduct whatever fundamental analysis process you have to make sure you have selected the best companies to represent your idea 3. Place these into a watchlist and monitor them daily, weekly etc for entry points Into the portfolio. Conduct reviews of your views and clean out the list frequently so it's fresh and relevant for the current market environment"
2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Alphawave IP Group LON:AWE Good morning r/stocks,

I was wondering if anyone here has looked into LON:AWE at all and if so what your opinion are?

They're a new IPO on the LSE who register patents on chip designs. They have some very very impressive growth figures over the last couple of years and as such have quite a high market cap, currently £2 billion on a £44 million 2020 revenue. Worth noting that the 2020 revenue is up 539% on 2019. They look like a good long term growth stock but I'm a bit worried that the growth is already priced in. They have dropped 21% from IPO last month which suggests other think the same. Not sure if this is a good dip for a buy in or a sign of continued downwards progression. 

Very keen to hear anyone else's thoughts on this stock, especially if you know more about it than I do. I don't know much about the chip sector so if you do please get involved! 

Cheers!"

Currently reading the intelligent investor as a newbie, and noticed Graham recommends a certain percentage of your portfolio in bonds.

2021-06-02 12:32:53,stocks,rug pulled!
2021-06-02 09:46:40,stocks,"XLK and QQQ look solid so far and the Nasdaq is having problems at getting going...smh.

Edit: It's up, yes, but when XLK is up as much as it is right now, I've often seen it up 50-80 points. That's not the case at the moment."
2021-06-02 10:34:40,stocks,"I get it, I was wrong on oil for the time being at least...

I've said that I believe it'll be a leading sector, it's just not something that interests me.

And no, I'm not against owning things that aren't tech, even though it's what I tend to talk about the most in here. I own both tech and non-tech and I think I said a while back that I regret not getting in Honeywell."
2021-06-02 12:25:14,stocks,"I woke up rock hard just like I have the past few days, that was how I knew I was sucking up more of those BB June 4, 18,  $16,17,20 calls"
2021-06-02 12:53:02,stocks,"Is there a place subreddit/ discord anyone knows of to discuss chart reading and ideas? 

Like a place to post ideas of what I think a chart is doing (wedges, hi-lows, triangles etc.) and let people give feedback on that?"
2021-06-02 06:14:28,stocks,"It makes even less sense than GME. Gamestop had begun the process of turning around their dwindling business, they were shorted over 100% of float, the fair value of the stock was a lot higher than it was at.

AMC is in a significantly worse position than it was before the pandemic, when it was trading at like $7... and it's not even that shorted. It's like watching the coins pump, there's no underlying valuation or sense to it, just speculation that it will keep rising."
2021-06-02 12:03:29,stocks,"I bought into AMC at $15 a few months ago during the initial meme stock hype, held onto it for months and bailed on Friday when it hit $27. I’d only invested 200 bucks so was happy with my 100$ or so profit.

Now I’m really frustrated cause a few hundred more would have been a massive help. Trying to take solace in the hundred bucks profit but FOMO is a killer."
2021-06-02 07:23:26,stocks,"I can't believe wsb and these cultists have the capital to pump it up this much.

There must be some big players involved riding this out. And you know they will be winning in all of this while the people throwing their savings in there will be left holding the bag."
2021-06-02 15:03:03,stocks,They are penny stock based on their true value. That is where they will belong eventually.
2021-06-02 18:12:42,stocks,This random internet stranger suggests she sells them immediately at this price
2021-06-02 17:05:15,stocks,We need to know how this turns out please.
2021-06-02 18:59:38,stocks,"You bet it all on black and won. Congrats, just don't think it will always be that way."

2021-06-02 15:55:16,stocks,"Oh darn, what a horrible problem to have. Best of luck."
2021-06-02 15:55:12,stocks,How do you forget you own a stock for 4-5 months lmao.
2021-06-02 16:14:45,stocks,"If you’re comfortable with options and you own at least 100 shares, sell July $70 covered calls, they’re currently trading at $30. 

Worst case the price goes to zero and you still pocket $30/share. Best case it expires in the money and you’re forced to sell your shares at $70, plus the initial $30. 

Actual worst case the price shoots way past $100+ and you missed out on all the gains, but pocketing $70+$30 is a nice consolation prize. 

Either way since you bought in at $13 you have the chance to lock in a 230% gain at today’s prices."
2021-06-02 06:55:42,stocks,Hertz
2021-06-02 08:05:16,stocks,"Lol yes absolutely. But they used to be actual good companies that had a lot of potential that the general market hasn't picked up on yet; companies like AMD, AAPL, TSLA, and of course the ""BECKY ETF"" were all huge meme stocks before GME."
2021-06-02 06:43:35,stocks,TSLA
2021-06-02 07:40:13,stocks,"I'm going to have to sell out of it, but I'll buy back after it crashes again."

2021-06-02 14:59:20,stocks,"BB is good company stock to own. They own some Govt. contracts, make some ev car parts and own many intellectual properties registered too. 2020 should had been their coming out year but Covid ruined it for everyone."
2021-06-02 16:26:26,stocks,"Just know they’ll use that money to buy more shares of something that will probably
Tank at some point"
2021-06-02 11:03:14,stocks,Bears only emerge from hibernation to warn about Boe Jiden and the incoming Venezuelan economy when the weeks are red.
2021-06-02 11:49:22,stocks,"I think anyone uttering the line, ""Be fearful when others are greedy, greedy when others are fearful"" over the last... year, or so, doesn't know what fear is, nor greed for that matter. Greed is almost a trillion in *known* borrowing to buy equities. Greed is the privilege to borrow up to 100x against your own cash to buy speculative assets. Greed is what killed Archegos. 

Fear is something we haven't seen since March 2020. And even so, that fear evaporated in a few months. Fear is not what we saw in March 2021. Fear is not losing 30% on extremely overvalued stocks, let alone 5% in a day. I see people call 2% down a ""discount"" and spout that tired quote in here like it's actually some sort of bargain. It's irritating.

I could see this crazy bull run going another year, maybe even two. The enthusiasm is high, people have the money to burn, and people are moving again. But stocks can go down, too, despite the meme. And when they do, the greediest ones will be left holding the bags."
2021-06-02 10:44:44,stocks,Time to be nervous for sure. Fearful is a few % points off.
2021-06-02 10:57:50,stocks,"Gloom and doom came from meme owners. Those people are currently doing well, and the people who own real positions and understand that long term doesn’t mean one month have never been short-term pessimists."
2021-06-02 12:29:05,stocks,"I don’t know, all I know is that the US will be releasing the May CPI numbers the 10th of June, and no matter what it says, markets will tank before, and if it’s as bad as last time or worse, the market would tank even more. And then 2 days later we are back to normal like nothing happened."
2021-06-02 13:56:55,stocks,I’m starting to suspect as much. I’m wondering if there’s a dump off tomorrow or Friday. This is pretty much how it went last time.
2021-06-02 15:42:29,stocks,Dollar Store King Midas
2021-06-02 14:37:18,stocks,that’s one of the meme stocks aswell unfortunately
2021-06-02 13:46:01,stocks,"Just goes to show there's something else behind these ""meme"" stocks other than social media hype."
2021-06-02 13:57:06,stocks,It's crazy how all meme stocks go up and down together. There's no way retail can be this coordinated.
2021-06-02 14:39:40,stocks,"Yep. It has to be whales and algos driving these stocks at this point. 

The first melt up in GME actually made sense as more than 100% of the float was shorted. But with BB, AMC, and GME this time around its only a fraction of that (20% or less).

This seems like the mother of all pump and dumps"
2021-06-02 15:28:30,stocks,I finally broke even on my PLTR and sold out of that
2021-06-02 14:00:37,stocks,I wonder if there’s a lot of institutional money driving this up with the goal of flipping it for easy gains and then shorting it at the top.
2021-06-02 14:05:40,stocks,"It's the same as before, retail traders and reddit start driving it but others hop on board.  As I said earlier, I own PEJ and they are up to 10% of their holdings in AMC now.

This isn't margin, though, it just more people seeing what is happening and taking advantage."
2021-06-02 13:59:29,stocks,"That's not the reason for the late January market selloff though.

Had the memes stayed asleep, the weekly options expiring likely takes over on that Friday, but since they weren't, that day turned into a deleveraging day. 

Wednesday was too. Thursday was a couple mins from likely being the same, then buying got cut off."
2021-06-02 14:00:36,stocks,Why would they be propping it up? What do they have to gain from exposing themselves to inflated values?
2021-06-02 12:24:53,stocks,nice. Finally someone smart enough to know when to get out.
2021-06-02 12:25:06,stocks,Tempted to do the same now!
2021-06-02 16:16:16,stocks,I legitimately thought that I was coming in after the memes when I bought into $BB in February and happy about it. But it's been a fun couples of days I had to jump out today I don't have the stomach to chase the top.
2021-06-02 17:10:40,stocks,Why you wanna baghold again?
2021-06-02 16:18:47,stocks,Oil is carrying it on its back.
2021-06-02 16:54:32,stocks,surprised it’s not down with the run on tech and memes
2021-06-02 13:05:17,stocks,"It was always so before, just not many people truly knew about it."
2021-06-02 14:46:58,stocks,"Did you miss out on 2020 ?

We had a phase where literally any company that makes it into news pumps like mad, negative, neutral, positive news, doesn't matter, it pumps. Heck it got so bad bankrupt companies had bigger green dildos than anything around.

We had hundreds of companies being hyped and going up 100% - 3000% past year. Heck multiple times companies with similar name went up 1000% because people mistaken tickers.

Of course with Tesla leadings it charge climbing almost 1000% to definitely 1000 PE at the time.

I would attribute GME stock with 2020 more than 2021 as well, everything that is said and gambled on about in 2021 came out from all the research and crap written up about it past year, which was constantly spammed just like it is now.

Not even arguing that market didn't become casino, but if it did it was the corona crash year and endless FED printing and non sense that followed it."
2021-06-02 18:54:18,stocks,I'm 14 and it's deep.
2021-06-02 08:42:32,stocks,Imo BB has good fundamentals and a promising future but it's a bad stock to own because it got caught up in the meme craze.
2021-06-02 09:00:56,stocks,Bb is a cyber security and automotive company now they aren't going anywhere

2021-06-02 09:39:34,stocks,Unfortunately it dumped 10% at opening bell.
2021-06-02 09:15:53,stocks,Good tip. Thank you.
2021-06-02 09:17:41,stocks,Hmm.
2021-06-02 10:12:49,stocks,"Not sure what you mean? 

Looking at the chart, it's been floating around 135\~142 for the last month. Usually large cap stocks will trade sideways until there is positive PR or earnings."

2021-06-02 17:00:09,stocks,Congrats! I stayed out of this one but it’s great to hear stories like this. Hope you’ve cashed some out and not just sitting on unrealized gains
2021-06-02 16:08:02,stocks,"Yeah, I dumped my high cost bags at basically breakeven and held my lower cost ones that I bought to average down. I figure if it dumps tomorrow, at least my cost basis is fairly close to where it’ll end up."
2021-06-02 17:46:33,stocks,"Gratz, sold at break-even here after rough morning. Sadly I lost on 10k profit I I held till evening. But atleast not down 25k on BB like 2 weeks ago"
2021-06-02 15:56:06,stocks,I did the same thing and am planning on the same thing.
2021-06-02 18:38:52,stocks,"Same, was bagholding and decided to fully bail at the end of the day no matter what.

Missed the peak but still came out with 9ish% profit.

My experience in the last 6 months is that there's a computer somewhere running an algo that ties AMC and BB together but with a focus on AMC.

When it kicks in both AMC and BB have the sameish curve.
Except BB's up are way lower than AMC, the down are lowers and BB lose all momentum when it stops trading.

With AMC going up in ridiculous % and $ amount today I don't trust it and BB to stay up overnight, nevermind tomorrow."
2021-06-02 11:22:31,stocks,the real discount was a few weeks ago when it crashed to 80-85

2021-06-02 12:09:31,stocks,Probably overbought atm. Hoping for a pullback soon

2021-06-02 12:26:44,stocks,Disney has a track record of sustained profitability and earnings growth. Wildcards are profitability of D+ and the negative impact of cord cutting. AirBnB is a company that has a great product but no track record of profitability or earnings growth. Ill wait to see AirBnB prove they successfully leveraged the capital from their IPO before I invest.

2021-06-02 12:59:21,stocks,All Reddit favorites are up; AMC lifts all short boats.
2021-06-02 15:10:13,stocks,If it hit your number sell it. If it goes up more who cares you got what you came for.  If it goes down you will regret it. If it goes up you will only slightly regret it.
2021-06-02 18:12:46,stocks,"Not a chance, it was a small dip and it came back already, the only chance of it crashing is if they announce another delay or something worse bit the future looks bright for the company and Branson is set to fly soon which will spike the stock up"

2021-06-02 13:09:31,stocks,I thought that about AMC at $30 yesterday now it at $60 if I had only waited one more day. So who knows if you actually selling at the top or just a midpoint of another run up.
2021-06-02 13:09:28,stocks,I sold about 3 hours ago.  God dammit.
2021-06-02 13:12:10,stocks,Do you think it will be at $21 in five years?
2021-06-02 14:31:44,stocks,"10% is not high. All the meme stocks are correlated for whatever reason, so its going up with the rest of them at the moment."
2021-06-02 14:28:08,stocks,Yes. BB will likely revert to its mean when AMC and GME stop going up. It shouldn't even be correlated

- buy meme stock at a low price (give it time to come down from its previous run)

- hold while it fluctuates and chills, maybe even loses value, usually for several weeks straight

- post regularly asking what you’re supposed to do with it because it’s been a month and it’s not going up

- ask others if you should sell and if you’ll ever get your money back (do this often)

- wait for the next meme stock run where you can rub it in everyone’s face and pretend that you were totally confident in your purchase of a debt-saddled cookie cutter movie theater chain that’s going to lose money for another year at a minimum"

Short term (1-3 months) is going to be volatile AF, especially as pipe investors release their shares (total of 850 million shares, 200m available for trading right now with the rest in lockup until various metrics are met). SoFi appears to be a very solid company, the DD I have done shows strong user growth, low debt, good growth, will be profitable this year with over 1B in revenue. They are also pursuing a bank charter and have acquired a California bank to help with that, should the bank charter get approved the stock could easily jump above $30 by the end of the year. PT's are all over the map, realistically WITH the bank charter this year I see the company sitting in the $30-40 range as long as the market stays healthy overall. If there's good earnings reports and continued growth I could even see it as high as $50 with the charter. 

&#x200B;

This is a long term play though, at \~$20-25 a share you just buy and sit on it, this company really offers a one-stop shop in terms of all financial avenues (loans, credit cards, mortgages, investing, etc).

2021-06-02 15:08:14,stocks,"High short interest.

Think about it this way:

Let’s say I create a company and sell 1m shares at $10 per share. Market cap = $10m. However I don’t plan on doing anything with the company. In fact I take the $10m and blow it all in the casino. The intrinsic value of the company is $0 but market cap is $10m.

So hedge funds look at my firm and say (rightfully so) it’s overpriced. So they short it, betting the price will go down.

News gets out my company is heavily shorted. Wallstreetbets starting pushing the price up to $30 a share. Hedge funds aren’t too worried because they know it’s now massively overpriced, and they will pay interest waiting for the price to come down.

Now here’s the kicker: I take advantage of the high share price and issue new stock at $30 a share (10 million shares). So I receive $300m from share issue. I don’t plan on doing anything with the money. 

Now the intrinsic value of the company is $300m (the cash). The hedge funds start to panic as even though they correctly shorted a massively overvalued company, by virtue of the new stock issue and the cash on hand, the company is no longer by definition so overvalued.

So they start buying back the stock they borrowed at inflated prices, which pushes the share price higher.

This is largely what happened with AMC."

If you think it will sustain a higher price because the underlying business supports these prices, then hold onto it for the long term. 

Personally it looks like it will come crashing when the hype dies again, so probably safest to sell once you break even or maybe even for some small profit, but greed will get you burned again."

But by the same token there's clearly a number where it would be dumb not to take profit, right? For me it's $15usd. I set my sell order last Thursday and have watched closely ever since.

Way I see it, if after this rise it settles back to a higher floor but never hit $15, that's a long term win. If it shoots to $20-$25 at it's peak and I sold at $15, I can live with that. If it goes back to it's recent month low? Well then I played it wrong but I'm no worse off than I was.

But my hope is that I sell, and buy back in at whatever the next floor presents itself to be. Locked in really nice gains on the year, and can go back to my long strategies.

I don’t think a leveraged ETF can outpace the bizarre price behavior on a select few stocks. It might actually be higher risk with a lower reward. People can downvote if they want, but it’s the truth, at least for right now."

The problem lies in some non-obvious inner workings of these instruments. They are made for short term trading and in the long term they tend to perform worse than their non-leveraged counterparts.

It would be better to get a broker that borrows you with low interest - some ask around 1% yearly - and buy more of a standard ETF. Still you are exposing yourself to risk, a serious market crash may wipe you out.

2021-06-02 12:40:58,stocks,Maybe 5 or 10% of portfolio but go with S&P 500 leveraged ETF.
2021-06-02 11:03:49,stocks,!remindme 2 months. Is OP on fire from 5X leverage?
2021-06-02 16:09:36,stocks,"The reason is that you can usually get even higher leverage with out of the money calls, provided it blows past that strike price. You could've, for instance, bought AMC $40 calls for $0.05 probably before the last two weeks. So that's $5 for 100 shares of leverage past $40. With AMC currently at $65, it's the equivalent of earning $2500 for $5, or a 50,000% return."
2021-06-02 19:15:01,stocks,"If you’re desperate, broke, and have a stupid high tolerance for risk."
2021-06-02 18:12:15,stocks,Seems like nothing can bring this stock down. Wish I pulled the trigger at $20 when I had the chance
2021-06-02 17:29:00,stocks,Why?
2021-06-02 18:52:43,stocks,Nope try $PSTH
2021-06-02 12:18:17,stocks,"If you don't know what you're doing I'd just take the money and run. But it's just 50 bucks, so do whatever."
2021-06-02 06:45:15,stocks,Immense share dilution aswell for AMC since 2020.
2021-06-02 07:24:13,stocks,Amc is a pump and dump.
2021-06-02 13:58:31,stocks,It could have just as easily gone down and you’d be kicking yourself for not taking the gains.
2021-06-02 10:03:26,stocks,"Yeah, it’s not wsb. It wasn’t with GME either. There is always someone behind these plays"
2021-06-02 10:02:28,stocks,">There must be some big players involved riding this out.

Yes, among them the hedge funds they hate so much."
2021-06-02 18:21:12,stocks,I agree. But I’ve been telling her the same since it hit $30
2021-06-02 12:33:59,stocks,I thought the same thing when I broke even with AMC at $16...
2021-06-02 15:56:08,stocks,Bought it as a meme and figured I’d hold. Then lost interest between my actual job and a move and shit.
2021-06-02 08:20:33,stocks,Hertz was the original ridiculous meme stock that had no fundamentals.
2021-06-02 07:02:23,stocks,TSLA clearly had value in their valuation. I dont remember people buying in Tesla blindly hoping for a short squeeze
2021-06-02 16:30:34,stocks,"I mean, I don't want people to lose money haha. Truly I am happy to see regular people make some coin. I'm just every so slightly jealous lmao. Investing slowly and smartly has netted me a total loss, but memes have netted people massive gains. What a wacky time!!!"
2021-06-02 11:14:17,stocks,"99% of this sub wasn’t in the market before 2008 (and even I was only in it a few years before that). This has been an insane 13-year run, and it’s made all of our skin a lot thinner."
2021-06-02 11:59:30,stocks,"Wait.. soo.. you back up the assertion that equity is overbought, and people are regularly buying 2-5% dips on already inflated securities... and still see this bull run going another year or 2? Lemme know when we're at the top, please?"
2021-06-02 10:54:47,stocks,"Wheres your cutoff? Struggling to see anything over 4k in the 500 be more than overbought. Tooo much QE, stimulus, went straight into the market. RRM still a huge concern.. not enough assets to justify all this money."

2021-06-02 18:27:24,stocks,Worst decision u could have made imo. Well see how it goes.
2021-06-02 15:32:55,stocks,That was silly
2021-06-02 14:10:45,stocks,"Most likely. 

With retail they have a great scape-goat too"
2021-06-02 14:08:07,stocks,They flip it like what Mudrick Capital who bought the shares yesterday did. They were public but others probably buying and flipping too.
2021-06-02 17:12:20,stocks,Same. Had BB calls and sold them all today to pay off the wifes car. I think it will keep going up a bit but I definitely feel a sense of accomplishment by being able to have 1 less bill on our monthly schedule.
2021-06-02 15:06:00,stocks,It’s my families items anyways and they actually received 10 free Pink Flamingoes from a shipping mistake so we’re still up money in that regard lol
2021-06-02 17:24:28,stocks,"I doubt they are because anytime it goes down, they just think it's a ""short attack"" and to buy the dip. I know this because I was one of those people 4 months ago. Sigh..."
2021-06-02 16:58:43,stocks,Might not even help if it shoots down as fast as it shot up
2021-06-02 15:00:41,stocks,Sooo buy the BluechipDIP
2021-06-02 11:31:54,stocks,"Nothing has fundamentally changed since it hit 8.50 a month ago.

2021-06-02 12:10:36,stocks,Same though there’s been a few filler episodes out i think it’s picking up
2021-06-02 12:45:46,stocks,Yeah I still took profit since I got in at $4 but still....i'm just gonna cry lol
2021-06-02 17:27:49,stocks,Great thanks for the perspective!
2021-06-02 17:56:12,stocks,Yeah I’ve been enjoying the slow and steady/flat creep up. Feels healthier than the constant skyrocket or tumbles. Just worried that 7 tiny green days will be negated by 1 red one lol
2021-06-02 16:14:53,stocks,"A lot of things lmao. My portfolio was super tech/growth heavy but I diversified and added a lot of financials and steel companies last month. When one thing’s down, one’s up and it’s been a lot of offsetting. Plus the overall market’s been pretty flat lately lol"
2021-06-02 12:39:17,stocks,"I keep telling myself that lol. I've watched my portfolio go up and down drastically without getting worked up before, but the  fact that my pessimistic joke came true almost immediately does drive me fucking crazy I do confess"
2021-06-02 16:39:39,stocks,"Of course, if you have a business that’s not making money, and your investors are the only people eager to give you money, making your investors happy becomes your business plan 😄

Congratulations, you are now in the business of … selling stock! Your target customers are Reddit investors!"
2021-06-02 09:46:17,stocks,"Yeah not sure why, but I’m holding long and am very bullish on the company’s future."
2021-06-02 14:06:24,stocks,At least gamestop people can pretend to sell a turnaround story. Tf is amc gonna do? Sic a ransomware attack on Netflix?
2021-06-02 12:11:00,stocks,"I think it's technicals. The stock need some momentum to move significantly.
I'm just waiting."
2021-06-02 11:29:06,stocks,"Oh yeah, bought the hell out of that"
2021-06-02 12:16:18,stocks,you have any positions?
2021-06-02 19:31:55,stocks,Is this the only ticker you post about Jesus Christ
2021-06-02 13:14:16,stocks,maybe or maybe not. But I have a hunch that PLTR right now is following the meme trend and will eventually come crashing down again so I'm taking this chance to get out of my high-cost base PLTR position and possibly look for a better entry. It could also just keep going up and I will be wrong then but I'm comfortable with that scenario
2021-06-02 13:21:31,stocks,Retail will be the one who suffering. Big players will coordinate dumping it all at the same time when they decide its game over.
2021-06-02 13:18:50,stocks,Fomo is driving the price up right now
2021-06-02 13:18:36,stocks,AMC is going ham...
2021-06-02 13:35:21,stocks,"I bought puts last Friday that are at the same price as now as they were then, even though the stock is up 100%.  Now is when you want to be selling options so long as you have a risk management system in place."
2021-06-02 14:12:02,stocks,"Stop losses are set, don’t mind if I loose. Had to get in because of the FOMO"
2021-06-02 19:28:41,stocks,Don't forget to ignore everyone who tells you to sell because you only are looking for confirmation bias after already making up your mind
2021-06-02 19:25:03,stocks,"Buy more BB... still u it has room to grow...
Like AMC =$66, and BB = $15, BB has lot more room to grow"
2021-06-02 16:44:51,stocks,"GME diluted shares by 5% (remember that in 2019 or 2018 there was quite big buyback), AMC diluted by, how much, 300%? Comparing those two in attempt to predict post-squeeze price isn't the best idea."
2021-06-02 16:42:59,stocks,"Literally not even the same fucking thing.

GME was a dying company and its turn around story.

AMC was a dying company or at least company in decline, now it got huge cash injections from backs of investors and a new fanbase. If nothing changes its going to be right where it was after 5 years.

On top of that you are at the wrong sub reddit, we were not even talking about what its share price is going to be, just about financials. gtfo"
2021-06-02 08:22:49,stocks,"It seems like he wants to invest because of the drug they're making. The issue is that he has no medical knowledge. They IPOed at $5, went to $13 in 2014 & now sit at $1.40. They have no earnings to their name, doesn't seem like they've had any for years either."
2021-06-02 07:47:51,stocks,I must not have been checking as much that day because I caught it after it was resolved. But thanks.
2021-06-02 10:58:55,stocks,I have Shell and Suncor. Both solid.
2021-06-02 11:43:20,stocks,BP and Shell here. I like to have some exposition outside the US.
2021-06-02 11:29:42,stocks,Agree with you out of these 3.. but.. No love for why is sq your go to?
2021-06-02 11:33:21,stocks,"I’d rather not pick something that is crazy overvalued. PayPal is a lot more fair than Square, but I’d rather get in on the ground floor with a company."
2021-06-02 12:23:36,stocks,"Usually I have understood the releases, but this time them cutting Braun came off weird to me. That also with all the news of Nick Khan having more power is leading me to think they are putting themselves in a position to sell. 

This is coming from someone who reads a lot of r/SC but I haven't done too much DD on financials etc"
2021-06-02 14:12:30,stocks,wait a few months and see how you feel. the downtrend is still happening so until it breaks that its probably not a good idea because you are playing on momentum with tesla as the valuation makes no sense
2021-06-02 19:12:28,stocks,*Look at mr. Moneybags over here...*
2021-06-02 16:37:12,stocks,"That is almost meme territory.

It has frequent posts and mentions on wallstreetbets together with Editas stock."

2021-06-02 14:38:40,stocks,"It's gambling because you never trully know when it's gonna to drop, I would never guess that we would have the biggest bull run during a pandemic, it's just random shit controlled by master puppets."
2021-06-02 15:08:45,stocks,This aint WSB. If that user wants to sell they can do it without shame. You never go broke taking profits.
2021-06-02 06:45:04,stocks,BBW?
2021-06-02 05:41:03,stocks,You mean the meme stocks are exciting.  The rest of the market is sideways with so much mixed information even the HFTs cant figure it out.
2021-06-02 08:09:40,stocks,"You realize the hedge funds havent lost anything yet right?  They're just paying interest. Who do you think plants those articles for you guys to find?  They want you to believe that you've won and if you buy just a couple more shares they will be defeated. Volatility is their friend, they need to create volatility in order to shift out of the shorts they're buried under. You're just helping them by repeating the propaganda and pushing the price up  

If you really want to squeeze them push it up very slowly over time and never let it drop. Dont push it up and watch it fall.  That's to their advantage."
2021-06-02 05:39:33,stocks,"Talking about the overall market, not the meme stocks. Amazon literally at 0% procent or something for the last 6 months with amazing earnings."
2021-06-02 14:53:38,stocks,"long term. but PLTR is pulling a swing today that 90% of the time results in a dip back to baseline or lower. 

do I take the risk to LOWER my cost basis."
2021-06-02 15:42:45,stocks,"Yeah, definitely some good points to consider"
2021-06-02 18:45:00,stocks,"BB spent like 2-3 hours dicking around my break-even price and it stressed me the fuck out. I barely worked today.

So glad I sold and made like 9% profit at the end of the day.

I prefer to sleep on a tiny bit of money than sleeping on a big pile of maybes."
2021-06-02 13:40:35,stocks,yep.. I said it at ~44... Stand corrected.. You people are on FIRE and there is a nice pool of water to jump in right here. 100% In a day?! Lol. I dont even know why its jumped this hard. Totally a meme rally.
2021-06-02 12:26:16,stocks,Bruh GME is back where it was it will hit 300 again?
2021-06-02 12:05:32,stocks,"Sell a fraction, hold the rest. I sell in parts over some time"
2021-06-02 12:10:16,stocks,"this isn't gme kiddo. there are faar more shares available, and amc keeps adding more."
2021-06-02 16:16:08,stocks,"It's not just the percentage, it's the correlation. All meme stocks are rising and CRSR is joining them, or do you think it's just a coincidence?"
2021-06-02 15:39:52,stocks,"It's getting a little out of control again though, besides volatility the behavior in the major averages today is sort of similar to one day before it got problematic.

If that movie stock does this again tomorrow with no OPEX I suspect the S&P is going to be blood red tomorrow."
2021-06-02 17:24:13,stocks,"It's not just not selling, it's more people buying. AMC for example just raised money selling shares that were immediately bought up by retail investors."
2021-06-02 17:50:33,stocks,">Its not going to pass until major blood gets spilled

&#x200B;

the only blood spilled is gonna mostly be from retail bagholders who got in at the top and were too slow to exit.

&#x200B;

but really though, let's get back to pumping AAPL and TSLA and whatever other shit stock that has been neglected.

lol"
2021-06-02 09:58:02,stocks,"Thanks, I too got on refreshing the app."
2021-06-02 15:36:05,stocks,"Hey, doing a quick copy/paste here and will ask you the same thing. Okay, so let's take you for example. If you can go back to yesterday when it hit $30 a share, and at that point you had $0 invested into it. And you didn't know  what yoy know today, would you buy that stock? I guess I'm just trying to understand if buying it yesterday at $30 was a gut feeling from that person or if he actually had some knowledge of what would happen..."
2021-06-02 16:36:01,stocks,"That’s … not how it works! 😆

A business value is determined by the expected future cash flows.
If a company dilutes its shares by 11x, every existing owner suddenly owns 1/11 of the slice of the business he owned before, and has a right to only 1/11 of the future profits he could have claimed before. In other words, individual shares are now worth less, not more.

And the increase in value of the company assets is nowhere near as significant as you depict in your example using extreme and unrealistic numbers (11x dilution, 0 initial asset value). It’s not going to put much of a floor on the share price."
2021-06-02 15:34:36,stocks,"This is a very good analogy. However, from what I understand, the hedge funds haven't start to buy back the stock they borrowed and this seems only riding the FOMO mouvement.

I might be missing something, but that's how I understand it. Now don't get me wrong, I don't believe all that AMC500K. it won't go this far, not even close, but if this is only due to FOMO and no one is covering yet, I can see this go pass 100$."

2021-06-02 19:34:35,stocks,"Yeah for op to only be up 7% there's something seriously wrong.

Like, that takes some skill."
2021-06-02 12:15:27,stocks,how high do you think it can go? infinite? I can short it (T212 allows it); and could hold 200 shares shorted potentially upto 70$ before I got margin called and lose everything. If it fell to like 25 from here I would double my money. safe bet?
2021-06-02 08:50:31,stocks,"I don’t know if smarter is correct word. 

They have a lot more advantages than retail. And I believe they’ve already lost hundreds of millions, if not billions, due to shorting these stocks. 

The hedge funds though consistently get away with price manipulation, when brokers stopped retail from buying in January, people were selling fractional shares in the thousands."
2021-06-02 08:47:53,stocks,How does this response address the question?

2021-06-02 12:10:30,stocks,I bought some July 16 25P. Currently upside down by about 50% lol but there is NO fucking way it's going to stay up for another 6 weeks.
2021-06-02 16:15:38,stocks,"I 100% agree its a it’s hit and miss. The thing is, even if there is no ""wsb movement"" for it, i think its a legit stock that will do well regardless :P"
2021-06-02 10:57:19,stocks,Maybe an example would help. The TECL etf dropped something like 66% at the pandemic start. Today it is still over 40% higher than it was pre-pandemic.
2021-06-02 11:40:12,stocks,This is what I do OP. 100% TQQQ and invest 1k into it every month.
2021-06-02 11:07:34,stocks,"I'm a pretty conservative investor too but I made good returns of GME on the first run up. Then I started chasing the dragon though buying and selling meme stocks and it starting cutting into my profits. 

To be honest I really didn't expect to see any of the meme stocks take off a second time though. AMC is currently way above its previous Feb highs and I can't imagine this will continue much longer. 

At this point I'm not touching the meme stocks with a 10ft pole."
2021-06-02 11:09:59,stocks,"I'm not doing 5x leverage now. The only time I'd ever think of using 5x leverage would be following a market crash. I'm going to do some research on some past crashes, and see how quickly I would've been liquidated, had I entered at certain percentage falls."
2021-06-02 19:17:59,stocks,"Well, it is risky. But after seeing what AMC was doing, and that BB was getting spammed everywhere AND still close to its starting price, I knew that it was eventually gonna get pumped. In any case I do enjoy buying these ITM options. Little risk of them going to zero, but still tons of leverage."
2021-06-02 14:05:49,stocks,"Yeah.

I’ve withdrawn everything from my trading account and am walking away from trading. Tbh, it’s kind of ruined my day....and I despise that it has. And if it’s not fun, why am I doing it? So I’m out. Going to take the cash and invest it into something more physical and fun.

Everyone, enjoy your gains :P"

2021-06-02 12:04:03,stocks,"The only reason I could see it going on that long is because there's absolutely no predicting when or how euphoria wears off. There's no telling the amount of leverage out there for real, and how dangerously positioned firms are. It's all guesswork. We could already be at the top. It might be when the S&P hits 6k. No one knows the top except in hindsight. All I know is that I am certain that this enthusiasm is transient. And when it wears off, this run will end."
2021-06-02 10:59:21,stocks,"My cutoff was last week lol. But I have learned not to underestimate retail.  Theres also a lot of stuff outside of the 500 that imo has room to run if the market doesnt pullback. Only a few spots but theres some value stocks still around.

Edit to add, I sold off most of my positions by now. So I'm expecting some pullback for sure. But I also considered that I might've left some meat on the bone."

In this example, the share price of Apple would rise. Do you at least agree with that? 

AMC raised $230m of additional capital. AMC’s intrinsic value is around $1billion (or at least that’s what it’s value was back in Jan before the short squeeze). So $230m is a very significant amount to raise (quarter of intrinsic value- ie as you say NPV of future case flows)"

This should end the argument! AMC equity value is negative. You are paying $65 at the time of writing to own $5 of debt and EBITDA in the next 12 months projected to be a 100 millions loss.
No short sellers are rushing to cover because AMC fair value just increased.

The closest resistance level would be around 13-14 dollars the past six months. So once it went past that and then past the ATH in January, 20, dollars. I'd say anything above 20 would have been a coin flip. 

Remember, there is different strageties for investing. When using TA, it's more a day trader/swing trader thing, where you figure out stocks to buy low and sale high based off those resitance and support levels. If you are going long on a stock, then it really doesn't matter as much and you should be more concerned with the Fundemental analysis."

I did keep a small ual position cause I think it has a little more to it.  I kept half my boeing position. Kept half of some other stuff. So I'm basically moving out of covid recovery and into stuff that needs economic recovery from other reasons, mostly managing debt and I think they have solid plans to do so even with a rate climb looming. 

Most of the stuff I'm shorting is retail driven but not quite meme stock either. I find those are really good for extra volatility without the risk of moving 200% in a day for a bucket of free popcorn.

TLDR; $HRTX marketing this summer could be huge . PT low of 22 and high of ~70 by Q3 . Rated buy. Currently sits at 13.40 

Heron Therapeutics recently had their newest medication , ZYNRELEF, approved by the FDA and are planning on pushing out the product THIS summer. Helps that they just got $150m to do it with too

Drug info provided by website:
“ZYNRELEF is the first and only extended-release dual-acting local anesthetic (DALA). Its formulation combines bupivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, with a low dose of meloxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). They work synergistically in a novel Biochronomer® extended-release polymer that provides controlled diffusion of both ingredients simultaneously over 72 hours at the surgical site.1-5 ZYNRELEF is the only local anesthetic considered by FDA to be extended-release, based on superiority to bupivacaine through 72 hours.” 

TLDR ^ non-opioid painkiller for post-surgery pain 

They’ve also revamped their website and added more info on ZYNRELEF. I see this as incredibly bullish and look forward to Q3 earnings. 

Edit: Adding on, they’ve priced their product at a lower price than competitors. This will surely give them more exposure due to being the less expensive medication. Ethically speaking, they also will aid in stumping the opioid addiction that many painkillers cause. 

[HRTX Provided Slides from conference today (6/1) ](https://herontherapeutics.gcs-web.com/static-files/60511d1d-bf04-45f1-8c5a-9cf50d9554bd) 

I’d see slide 8 for comparisons to others 

I’d give their website a look. What’s more, is that with the pandemic being handled, there will be more freedom and thus, more fuckers getting injured and needing surgery. 

Edit: UPDATE 6/3

New Motley Fool commentary.

“Entering last month, Heron Therapeutics had two FDA-approved drugs on the market. Both were designed to treat nausea in cancer patients. But in mid-May, the Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to Heron's post-surgical pain relief drug Zynrelef. The therapy combines a local anesthetic with an anti-inflammatory drug, and is administered as part of the surgical process. The delayed-release medication provides pain relief for 72 hours after surgery. Heron management believes this is key in helping post-surgical patients avoid the use of opioid pain medications.

The FDA approval was given for a limited set of surgeries: bunionectomy, total knee replacement, and a type of hernia repair. Those account for more than 2.1 million procedures annually, with 60% of those performed in an outpatient setting. Management has indicated it sees the potential for Zynrelef to hit $450 million in annual sales. Heron's other pain management candidate, HTX-034, recently entered phase 2 clinical trials. It aims to extend the pain relief to five to seven days. 

Given a boost from a federal budget that includes significant funds for research and raising awareness about addiction, Heron's opioid alternatives could quickly gain wide adoption in the medical community. Beyond public service campaigns and a speedier approval process, agencies like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid could create incentives for surgeons to use opioid alternatives like Zynrelef. There could also be regulatory support for its use in additional indications. There is already a precedent for Zynrelef's use beyond those initial surgeries approved by the FDA. The drug is authorized in 31 European countries for small- to medium-sized surgical wounds. All of this adds up to a significant opportunity for Heron Therapeutics to grow its sales.”

You do your own research, as I take no responsibility for any of your decisions. Good luck

2021-06-02 13:54:24,stocks,"I know nothing about the financials of this company but this is not a product to be terribly excited about.

It's a local anesthetic and there's not much of a market for local anesthetics. This is not a consumer product. It's not a pill and it's not like patients are injecting into their own surgical wounds. Saying it's ""non-opioid"" is misleading, there are few if any non-opioid local anesthetics already. And bupivicaine is dirt cheap and already works well; the utility of adding an NSAID is marginal at best."
2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"How specifically do US underwriters determine the offering price? Hi. I now live in a country where the underwriters have a duty to disclose in form S-1 how they calculated the initial offering price, including what peer companies they used in pricing, the standard by which they selected these peers, and the valuation metric(P/E, EV/EBITDA, EV/GMV).

Upon learning about the US IPO market, I found it very stunning that the US underwriters do not include such details with regard to company valuation in the IPO prospectus. Is this true? Or is there another document that lists above information?

If the underwriters do not disclose how they determined the price, then how do the institutional investors know that the offering price is just and based on objective standard?"

Inflation has returned and agriculture is an excellent way to hedge against it.

Right now, I'm looking at Gladstone Land (LAND), Farmland Partners Inc (FPI) and a relative unknown... which I find really cheap as well as intriguing... Vital Farms (VITL).

LAND and FPI have great looking charts and LAND looks to soon test new highs.

The first two pay a good divi and Vital is partially owned by Amazon... 4.1% I believe... where it most likely contributes to whole foods products. It also has a small float of around 40 million shares and is heavily shorted at 20%. They just had a great quarter but the SP was knocked back down.. presumably to allow shorts to cover.

A few times a week? How often does one of your picks have to go down $500+ before you're losing money? What happens when all of your capital is tied up in stocks going sideways bc you entered 10 trades w 3k each and they all down? Are you just going to sit on your hands until that cash is recovered, and just no longer trade until then?  

I'm not saying any of this will happen, and I hope it doesn't! Just situations you should be prepared for, worst case.  Unrealized losses are fine until you don't have any more cash to make money with, IMO.  My real point is you should have a plan for anything that could happen.

Personally, what I would do would be to buy enough shares so when it goes up (x%) I can sell some shares to lock in profit, and then i also still have some so if the stock continues to climb I'm still in it, and if it doesnt, my risk is reduced.

Tax wise anything less than a year is seen the same. Anything you held over a year is taxed separately.

I think a lot of people think it’s more complicated than it actually is. The formula is T+2 (the day you execute your sell + 2 days). If you make trades on Monday, that money can be used again Wednesday. Trade on Tuesday, that money can be used again on Thursday. Etc."

How often are you getting that kind of trade though ... and how often are you eating big ol' losses trying to set up a win like that ... you get what I mean? If you take profits early, then your losses will outgrow, but if you hodl waiting for peak alpha, you're likely to end up bag holding.. or I ended up leaving profits on the table bc I couldn't cash out same day and then trade went south after 24 hrs. Or trade was still developing slower than expected but I needed to sell at a loss bc I didn't have capital to enter a new trade... 

Or, you end up just growing your account very slowly. 
At least this was my experience with the cash account.

Unless you consistently just knock it out of the park on monster trades. But even if you are doing that, you'd benefit from the ability to apply more capital."

Personally, I tend to bet on reversals and not momentum, so I would be biased that this chart is going to pullback before it continues climbing, but the RSI would indicate it shouldn't sell off too much if it does ... if it sold to 221 and failed, I would expect it to fall to 205 and if it broke that then 190 and then 185 looks like it was tested alot ... but I really doubt that would happen tbh.

This means you now have $5 cash and a stock worth $95. The second a dividend is paid it is taken out of the share price. Since this is the case I would say getting the 2% SPY dividend and investing $1,000,000 would be my favored route. (Since this isn’t dividend hunting and is less than 4%)"

Honestly, I don't think the next year is a good time for this particular kind of strategy. Instead, you might focus on how you can invest that kind of money to make consistent gains that beat dividends. It isn't ""set it and forget it"" but I think you'll annihilate a small dividend with basically anything else in the next few years."

The main reason I dislike dividend stocks is that you could simply invest into the S&P 500, instead of a single company you have to hope for to keep performing as they do its a big chunk and the average return is 8-10%. So you could just buy it for 200-250k and sell the profit you made. This is less reliable since it has years where it goes up a lot, others where it falls and again others where it barely moves.

2021-06-01 22:21:26,stocks,"very very simplified version

fed lowered interest rates to 0 -> much easier to borrow money -> economy gets set on fire which helps repair it from covid damage. side effect is inflation happens which is good for the economy. encourages spending and not hoarding money. problem is people think there'll be too much inflation. how does this affect equities?

two schools of thought: inflation bad for market because companies will have to increase spending for their unit costs this will hurt companies and their profits = bad for equities. flip side, companies have gotten a massive boost from covid + fed policies. because of this, their future earnings will crush inflation and push them to sky high levels which means stocks go up.

also: if theres too much inflation, fed might need to raise rates to decrease inflation. but will this rate raise kill the economy or are companies strong enough now?

ultimately, it's all how you see it."
2021-06-01 22:48:24,stocks,"The Fed is the Federal reserve bank of the US. The fed controls the money supply (aka the amount of US dollars and cents printed). It’s a closed system (technically). Every night the Fed actually ships money to all US banks at an interest rate 0.0-0.25 currently. The bank (JPM, Wells Fargo, PNC, etc.) in turn lend the money out. When the Fed adds money to the money supply the value of the dollar goes down and inflation goes up. When the Fed tightens the opposite happens."
2021-06-02 09:50:24,stocks,"The Fed controls the value of the stock market by controlling the amount of money used to buy stock. When they lower interest rates, more people borrow money and buy stocks. When they raise interest rates, less people borrow money and buy stocks. 
If less people are buying stock, the value of it drops. So if stock owners think the Fed will raise interest rates, they want to sell their stock before the rates actually go up and less people take out loans to buy more stock.

Quantitative easing is just money printing. They make up new terms and change the jargon of easy to understand things every economic cycle so people forget the market will eventually crash and most of them will lose their savings. 
Government bonds are debt. When the government passes a funding bill, it writes that amount, for example $6 trillion, on a piece of paper that says ""I owe you $6 trillion"". 
It then gives this piece of paper to The Fed. The Fed then prints $6 trillion dollars and gives it to the Government, who then allocates it.
The Fed then takes this piece of paper it was given by the government, which is a government bond, and breaks it up into little pieces and these pieces which are government bonds are sold onto mostly pension funds (middle class savings).

Anyway, the stock market is going to collapse once the Fed decides to stop blowing bubbles in it, then there will be hyperinflation from all the ""quantitative easing"", and the government bonds owned by peoples pension funds will be worth nothing. 

If you ever wonder how $28 trillion in debt can ever be paid off. There are only three answers:
1) Pay it.
2) Refuse to pay it
3) Inflate it away.

Guess which option is in the best interest of the Fed and the Govt and congrats, you've just figured out the game."
2021-06-02 05:33:12,stocks,"Oversimplified but basically;

Inflation going up = Good for most stock prices. Or more accurately they hold their value while the value of dollars decreases.

Interest rates going up = Bad for most stocks. People move their savings to boring low risk stuff like bonds, bank deposits, ect, now they are getting a better rate. People spend less because they can't borrow as much. Present value of future dividends decreases and so on.

Fed = Wants inflation to be low and predictable so the economy doesn't get spooked, that has been their primary purpose for decades. They do this by raising or lowering interest rates (and more recently QE as well) to keep inflation around their 2% target. 

Why is everyone freaking out about this stuff recently = Inflation has recently spiked, the latest CPI reading was 4.2%. But the fed aren't worried yet because they have reasons to think it's temporary and don't plan to raise rates anytime soon. Question is, is the fed making the right call or are they making inflation worse by leaving the printer running? And if they do let the inflation cat out of the bag, how aggressively will they need to raise rates in the future to get it back under control once they do decide to act."

2021-06-02 02:30:32,stocks,"The Fed is a bank for the banks. Banks deposit and take loans with the Fed. Banks working with dollars must also follow rules set by the Fed. The Fed is not part of the federal government. The fed is owned by the banks that deposit into the fed, while many leadership positions at the fed are approved by the government. This is so long term economic decisions by the fed are not influenced by short term profit seeking banks and vote seeking politicians.

The federal funds rate is the interest rate banks pay to lend to each other. Changing reserve requirements and treasury bond supply are a few factors the fed uses to change the federal funds rate. A easy way to look at it is the more money Banks have to access, the lower the rate.

The interest rates you get is influenced by the federal funds rate, but more importantly the risk of your loan based on the collateral you provide to your bank. Loans with no collateral like credit cards will have rates around 20%, while mortgages with a house and down payment as collateral will be just a few percent above the federal funds rate."
2021-06-02 04:30:24,stocks,"You can get safe returns from things like treasury bills, yeah?  Stocks offer excess returns but also way more risk.  Stock prices tend to go to where the risk and reward balance.

Feds reduce rates, which lowers the amount you can make with safe investments.  Suddenly stocks look WAY more attractive than safe investments at current prices.  So prices soar.

*We are here*

Stocks are now expensive relative to projected earnings.  Fed raises rates.  Safe investments make more than before.  Stock prices tumble.

This is what everybody is nervous about.  May inflation numbers were high, leading to speculation that the fed might raise rates, so the market gets jittery.  Watch it happen again next week when June numbers come out...

There are other effects too...  When borrowing is cheap because rates are low, growth companies take on debt to grow faster.  Faster growth makes their prices spike.  

That was last year.

Now these companies have debt at low interest rates... If rates go up, they may have to restructure at higher rates, which makes it harder to pay off.  So growth companies saddled with debt got beat up pretty hard this year as people moved investments into boring companies with lots of cash.

2021-06-02 05:31:40,stocks,"The FED is what is known as a central bank. The FED simply means Federal reserve. Of course, it has no reserves, it just prints money. The idea behind a central bank is to manage currencies and come up with policies.   


The FED steals from you by inflating a currency, e.g. it prints money to make your money less valuable. Imagine if there was only one apple in the world, that apple will be  very valuable but now imagine there is 10 trillion apples, apples are not worth much. That's the essence of inflation, the more of something there is the less it's worth. So what meagre wages you work for becoming worth less and less every year.  


Interest rates are something set by the FED. This determines the loan interest payments e.g. you borrow 10,000 at a 1% interest rate. You now have to pay that 10,000 back along with 1% which adds up every year, e.g. 10,000 + 1% = 10,100 then the next year it does the same 10,100 +1% =??? this assumes you never pay back your loan.   


The FED. Not a government organisation, steals from you, and not a reserve of any kind"
2021-06-02 05:32:11,stocks,"The Fed controls interest rates in many ways, but the primary way is the Federal Funds Rate.

Banks are required to keep a percentage of their deposits with the Fed and that amount is calculated every night. If they’re short, they have to borrow money from other banks to make up for their short. Currently that rate is between 0-.25% This rate is called the Fed Funds Rate or Federal Funds Rate.

The Fed is the central bank of the United States, but is NOT a part of the government. It is a PRIVATE company controlled by the twelve regional reserve banks which in turn are controlled by local member banks.

The Federal Funds rate is the interest rate that is controlled by the Fed, but they also control the Discount Rate as well which is the rate that the Fed lends directly to member banks as a last resort. The Fed prefers that banks lend to one another and so the rate for the Fed Funds Rate is typically 1% lower than the Discount Rate.

Mortgage rates and borrowing in general are not directly affected by the Fed’s lowering or raising of any rates, but instead are affected by ten year treasury yields which are deemed safer by investors over mortgage backed securities. 

When interest rates are lower it allows for corporations to borrow more cheaply, thus allowing for more growth, and hence more profits, ergo pushing the stock market higher.

There are many types of bonds such as the 10 and 20  year treasury bonds which are the benchmark for long term borrowing eg mortgages.

If the price of a bond goes up, it’s yield goes down and vice versa.

When mortgages are originated, they are bundled together into a bond known as a MBS or mortgage backed security.

Quantitative easing  or QE for short is a fancy way of saying “printing money”. 

People and investors care about what the Fed Chairman says, because if he so much as hints that rates are going up, it’ll directly affect the stock market because stocks are valued future facing, meaning investors buy and sell stocks based on their future or anticipated value.

Been in since .72cents last year. Estimate on results should be in by end of summer. I see it hitting $14 by then. Again it's high risk, but the least risk in my speculation portfolio. 

If u think banking laws for medical marijuana will change in the US then ur time frame would fit that. 
I find tcnnf low risk as they are all over Florida.  It's the only store I go to as their product is better than other places here. They always beat earnings estimates and have 60% of the market share in FL. They also changed their accounting practice to use GAAP. I think its to be ready for when banking rules change to uplist their company to something like the nyse. I've been in since $7 and $10 and adding more if it hits $36. The risk in my opinion is how they do outside of Florida.  I think they will do well as their business model is working very well in Florida.

Then when Covid hit it fell to a low of ~$170, and didn't recover to the ~$230 mark til the end of '20.  

It wasn't til this year & the reopening that it really took off and is now essentially at the expected analyst high.  

Given the really big jump so far this year... I wouldn't bet against against a pullback as recovery/safety money begins to move around again.

Folks here are right that it's fine to do. They're wrong that it won't necessarily raise alarms if this is the first time you've ever transferred a large amount of money into the account.

However, if anyone bothers to look at the alarm, they'll see it's from your brokerage account and not give a fuck. Millions of people got involved in stocks for the first time in the last year, plus...it's your own account.

It would be a problem if you are transferring out of a retirement account. That has different tax implications. 

As long as you are filing your yearly tax returns and paying your taxes it’s no ones business but yours what you do with your money. And even if the bank reports “suspicious transactions” who cares? You have proof you earned the money and paid any taxes owed, right?"

The only time you would have to do anything is if you were to pull out over $10k cash(that would generate a form by the bank) then if you purchased something from someone for $10k you would then need to submit that form.  If you had just transferred the money via the bank then no form would have been needed.

My brokerage has contacted me after a large transfer of money to a bank saying they were just making sure I was doing it and all was ok, but some of that might have been making sure I was not planning on closing the account."
2021-06-01 20:49:47,stocks,Can someone explain how to make 20K in the Stock Market?
2021-06-01 22:05:37,stocks,If you walk into a bank and deposit a bunch of cash then they’ll flag it. As far as I know you’re good on transfers though.
2021-06-01 23:10:00,stocks,Most brokers make you wait two days! Two days to get your funds which is bullshit because it’s electronic and that shit should happen immediately. When transferring from bank to brokerage account the funds are “available” for trading immediately. Makes no sense at all. Bullshit
2021-06-01 20:21:50,stocks,Lol what do mean alarms?
2021-06-01 21:21:42,stocks,"No, it’s as long as it’s your money. Keep in mind the brokerage gonna send you a tax form for your gain if you have gain regardless if you transfer the money out or not."
2021-06-01 21:38:24,stocks,"I’ve owed every year for 15 years from freelance with a W2. Never had a “penalty” for the amount you owe so long as you pay it by the deadline. 

Quarterly if offered to keep the amount of taxes you owe more affordable based on how you’re acquiring your income."
2021-06-01 22:15:21,stocks,"I read another post about this a few weeks ago, there was a suggestion that you notify your bank in advance and also suggested some type of letter from your broker. I don’t really know, just eating crayons and trying to form some wrinkles over everything, so forgive me if that advice is off."
2021-06-01 22:59:57,stocks,No.  Its money thats already in the banking system not a cash deposit.
2021-06-02 00:18:42,stocks,"I don't know if 10 k or 20 k would raise an alarm. 10 million or 20 million it is a different story.  Some brokerage account have a cash account option. If you have money in the brokerage cash account, you can use a debit card, a check, etc. I am sure if you made your money selling stocks with them, they would raise any alarm."
2021-06-01 20:00:47,stocks,Depends on the country.

2021-06-02 02:01:12,stocks,Good thing GME is my savings account. Don't have to do anything.
2021-06-02 02:27:45,stocks,"Absolutely nothing. It is your money. You can freely move cash between your bank accounts (those in your name). You don't have to report it anywhere or to anyone, not IRS, no agency whatsoever. (Even in millions or billions I assume, but then I don't have millions or billions). 

There is a maximum amount of money you can transfer on a single day from one account to another when you do the transfer electronically. Some have weekly limits too. This depends on your account level.  But you can still go over that limit if you call them on the phone and initiate the transfer through them. These limits matter - for example if you are paying for your kid's tuition, you are going to need a few days to complete the transfer and you don't want to do initiate the transfer at the last minute. 

One scenario where people with sudden capital gains run into sorta trouble is that they forget to pay the 'estimated tax' on the capital gains in the quarter when the gains are made. Such folks may end up paying a penalty when you file your taxes depending on the amount of taxes due. 

If you transfer money to someone else, it is a gift. A gift of $10K (perhaps 11K these days) per person per year is freely allowed with no gift tax (you don't even have to report it). Neither party owes taxes or reporting obligations. The limits are higher in some cases, like you are paying for your grandchild's tuition. 

You can transfer money to any of your accounts, even to a foreign bank account. If you do transfer to a foreign bank account and if the max balance is more than 10K, you will have to tell IRS the foreign bank account number and stuff in 1040 (form 8938).  If it goes over 50K or 75K, you have to report those account numbers to another agency called FinCEN in the Department of Treasury annually. 

But back to the question, there is no red flag you can raise if you are transferring money from one account to another, if both are yours esp if they are both in US banks."
2021-06-02 03:27:11,stocks,20k is pocket change. The banks don't care. It's not like you're dropping a few milly of cash at a branch. They know exactly where the funds are wired from.
2021-06-01 22:32:21,stocks,"5k won’t do anything, but if you try and send $10,000 or more to a bank account in one business day, no matter if you do it in one single deposit or many smaller deposits, it invokes a little-known rule called the Bank Secrecy Act, where the bank/credit union has to report the transfer to the IRS within 15 days of receiving it, because large amounts of money moving like that could indicate potential illegal activity."
2021-06-01 22:47:11,stocks,"Banks report anything over 10k as a SAR. Suspicious activity report. If there’s nothing hokey about it, it’s not a big deal. If you start racking up SARs for a high score, people with badges may want to talk to you."
2021-06-01 21:40:46,stocks,"Cash Transactions of $10k require you to file form 8300 to the IRS to explain yourself, and the bank is required to report the transaction which is then shared with FBI, Homeland Security, IRS, and DEA.  

Basically cash transactions are flagged as money laundering.  If you attempt to get around the rule by depositing $9999 or something similar you might be accused of committing a felony called structuring.

Relevant laws are The Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act.

i was able to reopen them but they caused several issues in the interim."
2021-06-01 22:18:32,stocks,Nice try FED
2021-06-01 23:41:43,stocks,"No you will not be flagged for moving your own money from one account to another. But I do recommend making a single large transfer and avoiding many small transfers. This is important for a couple of reasons. 

First, you are only allowed 6 transfers from any interest account per month. It doesn't matter if you're transferring to another interest-earning account, such as a savings account, the transfer still counts toward that total. (I want to be clear that this limit is per account, not per person, and you can have any number of interest accounts. But it can be hard to track and your bank is not going to help you until they are literally issuing fines.)

Second, you want to avoid the appearance of structuring, or patterned transfers designed (usually by size and date) to avoid required reporting. You can always talk with your bank to schedule a transaction. But this simply isn't going to be an issue if you make large an infrequent transfers anyway."
2021-06-02 00:14:14,stocks,No alarms. You won’t be able to hide your capita gains.
2021-06-02 00:42:34,stocks,"It’s your money, no problems. Setttling takes 2 business days."

2021-06-02 01:15:57,stocks,"I used to work in WIM (Wealth and Investment Management) and was forced to take anti money laundering classes every month just about, you'll be fine. But I'm not sure what you mean when you say ""raise alarms."" Banks monitor EVERYTHING!! They have software systems that monitor every bank account they have. If a transaction seems suspicious, the banking system sends it to compliance for review. Most of the times it's nothing but they do look to see where the money came from. Brokerage accounts are good. A wire from overseas or another personal bank account ""needs further review."" Someone's account could be flagged by the bank and the account holder would never know. Anything that's over $9,999.01 goes under review. Some cases anything over $4999.01 goes for review IF there is no previous account history with those types of transactions. Unless you're up to no good, you have literally nothing to worry about. While the transaction is under review, it will show as pending in your account sometimes. Or.. the bank will let the transaction actually go through and STILL monitor it. The IRS wants their cut at the end of the year so do you need to worry? No. Is the bank looking at what you're doing? Of course. That's their job."
2021-06-02 09:05:02,stocks,"Yeah, my cash was actually frozen by a bank and I got a call asking me where I got that money from although it wasn't stocks but the other thig called with Bitc and ending with oin."
2021-06-02 09:15:44,stocks,"If you're really paranoid you can give your bank a heads up on the incoming transaction so they know it isn't anything crazy. However, if they've been seeing you transfer $ into this account from your bank and then there is a return I would think they can logically connect the dots."

2021-06-01 20:36:26,stocks,"What do you mean by ""raise alarms""?

The max cash you can carry across the border without reporting is $10K.  So I suspect that any kind of \*cash\* transfer over that amount will engender at least a little scrutiny on the part of your financial institution.  They'll take a quick look at your financial history and see if it's within the range of previous or ""normal"" activity.  I'm not sure what they would do if it's not ""normal""."

2021-06-02 07:04:49,stocks,It only raises an alarm if the money is unexplainable. So you are fine.
2021-06-02 07:25:56,stocks,"Alarms like an audit or something? No. Transferring large amounts of CASH could very well trigger alarms if it’s out of the ordinary (think cash businesses who make regular deposits would not raise alarms), but large check or electronic deposits from traceable sources should not trigger anything as long as you eventually report it for tax purposes."

2021-06-02 07:47:33,stocks,"Transferring large amounts into a bank might raise an alarm in certain circumstances. When I put a large downpayment for my house the bank said they need to do some background checks/etc.. to ensure we're not drug dealers or something like that.

You'll get flagged for potential fraud/etc if you don't.  10-20k probably won't trigger anything, but higher than that and they definitely want to make sure it's you doing it and not someone who jacked your account, added a bank account and can drain it and cash out before getting tracked down."

2021-06-02 11:27:51,stocks,Should not. It’s your money. Should discuss with your tax person. If you are selling positions and transfer your money. Be aware you may owe capital gains on your stocks sold. If you made profits. If not. Then you can claim losses on returns.
2021-06-02 12:05:13,stocks,It wouldn’t as long as you don’t give them anything to be suspicious about.
2021-06-02 17:41:49,stocks,"no.  but I would transfer more than 9999 at a time.  At 10k, the financial institutions are obligated to report it to the government."

2021-06-01 21:09:48,stocks,I think that the rule is transfers of over 9999$ have to have some sort of paper trail to help prevent money laundering. Like walking into a bank with a briefcase of 50 grand. But since it’s a bank to bank transaction more or less I doubt you have to do anything.

I'd add to this that (at least in the US) it's actually a crime and will raise more red flags to try to ""structure"" these transactions in order to avoid the banks reporting requirements. The banks are required to report certain types of activity to the Feds as part of the Patriot Act as a means of trying to find & fight terrorism & terrorism financing. As long as you're not a terrorist financier they won't care about you transferring $20k here and there. There's a paper-trail leading back to how you earned the money, so it won't raise any flags."

2021-06-02 04:44:18,stocks,It's because it takes a few days for the sale of your stock to settle.  When you transfer into your account they are essentially lending you the money until the transfer clears also.
2021-06-02 07:50:18,stocks,"If you're using ACH transfers in the US that's how they work. It has nothing to do with the broker.  It's unfortunate that the system is dated and slow, but that is how it functions.  Wire transfers can happen instantly (cost extra typically).  Of course if you are being held up in allowing to transfer it could be because the trade hasn't settled. Those also take two business days after you make them to settle. T+2 it's commonly called.  Again this really has nothing to do with the broker, it is how the whole system works."

If you try to avoid filling out this report, lots of people get notified. If for any reason any law enforcement agency would want to investigate you (which I guess could involve the IRS), they will look at CTR's you have filed."

I now have 20k in RH and want to transfer all of this to the bank account I have linked in RH.   I will file taxes next year and pay what's due.  Nothing secret, no structuring, no CTR...just plain old fashioned transfer.    Does the IRS get alerted or does the bank flag this transaction?    

And no, I didn't make 20k in penny stocks.     I am not that lucky"

2021-06-01 22:32:11,stocks,Gifts are almost never taxable to the receipient. The giver has a lifetime exwmption of around 11.5m or so (double if married).  Gifts within a year to a single individual of over 15k (double if married) eat into that exemption.
2021-06-01 22:51:46,stocks,"I don't know anything about taxes. If it doesn't look like you're laundering money I wouldn't really care.

2021-06-01 22:36:15,stocks,Go to a CPA and ask about gift tax
2021-06-02 06:19:18,stocks,"If you gift more than $15,000 to an individual in a year then you'll have to file a form with the IRS reporting the amount you went over the $15,000 which will then be deducted from your lifetime gift exemption of ~$11.5m (reverting back down to ~$5.5m in 2025).

So long as you don't exceed the lifetime exemption amount, no taxes will be due. If you exceed the lifetime amount, any amounts gifted over that amount will be taxed 25% (to you, not the receivers of the gift). If you die and your heirs inherit your wealth, any amount over the lifetime exemption will get hit with up to a 40% inheritance tax.

Obviously I'd verify this info with an actual CPA or estate planning attorney."
2021-06-02 04:31:18,stocks,Give me 5k and I will tell you how to reduce your tax burden. Lol
2021-06-02 01:58:20,stocks,"Gift tax is what you're looking for, and in the US there's a lifetime exemption, over 10 million iirc. So if you're in the US, you likely won't have issues.

Also, the tax burden falls upon the gifter, not the recipient."
2021-06-01 23:42:14,stocks,Write “personal loan” on the check you give them. Loans are not taxable. Double check with your cpa to be safe.
2021-06-01 23:37:31,stocks,Don't do this!
2021-06-02 00:22:12,stocks,"Family would still have to pay taxes on any gifts above around 10K

EDIT: why am I downvoted? This is 100% true. You can’t just gift family 100K without some of that money being taxed. They’ll pay taxes on gifts past a certain amount."
2021-06-02 02:16:50,stocks,Simple answer. The taxes are the burden of the person giving not receiving.
2021-06-02 04:05:00,stocks,There’s a gift tax form for doing just this. Additionally they would not be taxed so long as it’s under the lifetime gift limit. Consult an accountant and they can probably provide more details.
2021-06-02 05:20:16,stocks,"I’m not an accountant or lawyer, but for this size gift, you’ll need to file a gift tax return which I think is form 709. With the current exemptions no tax would be due, but it will eat into your lifetime exemption

2021-06-02 00:11:46,stocks,"The quick explanation- laws have been made (particularly the Bank Secrecy Act and Patriot Act) that make it a crime for banks to knowingly allow criminals to use the banks to launder money. 

Banks have AML analysts/investigators to look into potential money laundering and report it, in order to cut down on terrorism/organized crime and especially to prevent the bank from getting huge fines.

2021-06-02 00:25:41,stocks,"It varies by bank, but I'd say it would be resolved in a day or two. Anything like $20k from a brokerage account in your name, spent on normal stuff (food, bills, entertainment,  investments, etc), wouldn't concern anyone. There are laws in place for when a bank can hold money, how much and for how long.

Usually if you are transferring more than that on a regular basis, you have someone you know at the bank to call if there is a problem."
2021-06-02 08:25:35,stocks,"No I literally just picked two varying examples from a hat, haha. I think Belarus and Thailand are both considered high-risk regions by OFAC.

But always keep in mind, any region can be sketchy or normal activity, and the same $40k wire transfers to Afghanistan can look way different for an unemployed college student from Brooklyn vs an immigrant Afghani taxi driver sending money to his family.

>But the two seem so specific yet so disparate in circumstance.

That's probably one of the more interesting things about the job. So many reasons for laundering, and so many ways ways do it! You have to be able to research and pick up on things fast; one day it might be learning about the true cost of real estate in Laos and the next day it's figuring out accurate prices for shipping racehorse semen in Peru."

If most of your income is from a job, then this isn't an issue because the taxes come straight from your paycheck.

2021-06-01 21:29:07,stocks,"Any movement of funds over $10k must be reviewed by your financial institution, and will be deemed suspicious or unsuspicious by an analyst. If they deem it suspicious they are required to report it to FINCEN within 30 days. Actually, even if the transaction hovers below $10k they will still review it because numerous transactions like that are a red flag that you’re trying to avoid the $10k review. As long as you aren’t evading taxes or money laundering you should be fine with their review and nothing will come of it. You’ll never even know they looked into it.

*This is for transactions occurring in the USA."
2021-06-01 21:28:39,stocks,"Movements of money over 10k get flagged at the bank but that doesn’t mean that is bad, just notable. You opening a mortgage is flagged, same with using an equity line. They just have to disclose large sums of money moving around to the feds in case you are up to no good.

But FWIW, banks see a LOT more of your data and flag more things that you’d think. It’s how they call you and ask, “Hey are you in Louisiana and Nebraska at the same time right now?”"
2021-06-01 21:31:29,stocks,The bank knows it’s coming from a brokerage. The bank also knows the brokerage handles the tax documentation. The only alarm you might get is a credit card application from the bank.

2021-06-01 22:43:04,stocks,"Yep, that’s pretty much what I said. Money brought in (cash) the bank will ask questions and fill out a report.

The money is yours once it's cash and doesn't get triggered by fuck all ever again.  You can put a million dollars in your bank account tomorrow and other than the automatic processes that flag any transaction for an automated review, nobody cares.  You can then move that million out the next day to whatever you want.  Money moving around the financial system doesn't talk to the IRS, it talks to the Secret Service, FBI and if you really fuck up, the CIA.  Once it's ""cash"" it's just cash.  Once you turn that cash into something else, yeah it'll potentially trigger IRS things, but cash moving from A to B to C to Z just triggers money laundering/fraud/terror controls.  Which if you're not, nothing to worry about.  I sold stocks last year and bought a house in the same week in cash, no trouble whatsoever.  

Flag the transaction is a really vague term because there are a lot of automated controls over moving money to/from terror/crime/foreign entities, but if you're just moving money from robinhood to a US bank, there are zero problems other than robinhood probably wanting to make sure you're you."

2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Any advice for minimizing losses as this point on a short... and hear me out for those who would rather ridicule for having done so! AMC Overall I know the glaring recommendation is stop messing with what I'm not familiar with, but would really like to get back $10k of losses before exiting. If you have the time and patience to listen to my buffoonery...

I was lucky owning AMC before the initial short squeeze. Gained $16k and sold! I was only looking to buy and hold at that time but once something like that happens as a newbie it kind of sticks on your radar. I attributed this gain to luck not just for myself but for most involved really combined with some greed being exploited. So after that and reading it was very unlikely to happen again as hedge funds would be more prepared... well that made a lot of sense to me. So when there were then 2 quicks runs from around $9-12 range then back down and I made about $650 each time in a just a couple days (shorting after $11.5 and covering around $9.50).

This third instance I was just going to to the same, was just looking for a little profit.. but it clearly hasn't worked out the same. And kept buying a little more as it went up. Then all of a sudden the price went from $18 a share to over $30 and I got nervous thinking of these claims of it going up over $100/share... so I cover 800 of the 1700 shares I was short at $34 last week (on the spike up to $36) ...only to see it crash quick. Where then I was pissed I let fear set in as I'm never like that. I compared the price trends/graph on other squeezes and it looked to match other reversals... so that then made me think I was going to be missing out on all the continued price drops that were to come and I was an idiot of paying $34 to cover and I should get those shorts back to at least recoup some of what I would have otherwise if I didn't cover then.... so re-shorted the 800 around $26..... only to see it go back over $32 shortly after, maximizing my current losses in a few steps for nothing.

So now I've lost all my previous gains I made from owning on the first squeeze and the couple shorts a I did after... plus another $10k+. Maybe be even closer to $15k right now. My idea was if I could just skip out on all this volatility and possibility of getting squeezed to oblivion and purchase 1000 shares to hedge if it keeps climbing... I can hold and let things play out and then when we're in a reversal downtrend then close out.

My reason for not simply closing it is because I'd lose my short positions and they're not always available... and I do believe it's going to go down (although I know Reddit is probably not the best place to voice such thoughts without vitriol coming my way). The two previous other instances I shorted I'd say only 10% of my orders went though and I would have to sit there repeatedly trying to get an order to short to go through, rejected for market unavailability. If I close my shorts I could very well be not getting them back if everyone else sees the stock as being in a reversal and want to short as well at that time... I would lose my ability to gain back what I'm down by just closing out now.

No I don't have the ability to place options and looking at the application on Merrill Lunch it doesn't seem like I would qualify.

IDK... I was even thinking of just closing everything out and hoping to regain some loses if there's still room to run, closing and buying 1000 perhaps... but boy would that suck if it went down... taking the loses only to buy and it turn out to be a downtrend. Seeing as I don't mind holding on to for awhile it seems the odds of the price going down are more likely than up. At least at some point where i can exit and reduce some of the loses.

I do appreciate you taking the time to read and any advice. No this isn't my life savings or immediate funds I need to make ends meet, but part of it was vacation money. And I'm fine by missing vacation myself, but this is really making me feel like shit as it was more been about taking my gf somewhere for our two year anniversary, and I've already done tons of planning... just haven't finalize bc of COVID concerns. She's single mom whose deadbeat ex hasn't paid child support in the last year and deserves a vaca too. Really upsets me the idea of not going after talking it up in the past few months... and although I'm sure I still will book the trip as a matter of principle.... I really shouldn't if I don't get back $10k on these 1700 shares. $7 drop would be a blessing. I was looking to so if there was some consult option on Merrill but it looks like on ongoing advisory service not a consult option.

Anyway, thanks for listening and and or anyone who may have something helpful to offer, not simply pointing out the obvious fact I clearly made errors and shouldn't be messing with shorting."
2021-06-01 21:32:23,stocks,"There are plenty of stock to short, don’t short a meme stock. Hopefully you have learn your lesson and remember this. Okay, let see how you can get out of this. If you still have balls, you can wait it out and the stock will eventually go back down for you to cover. I say if you have balls because good chance it’s gonna go over $40 tomorrow and might go over $60 the next or it might go down. Meme stocks is not trading on fundamental, it’s a casino."
2021-06-01 21:42:23,stocks,Whatever you think your next play should be just inverse it.
2021-06-01 20:01:02,stocks,"First of all, don't listen to any of the cult morons that will come your way. They are literally in the same position you are in, clueless, newbie 'investors' who got in at the sight of free, quick money. The only difference between you and them is that they are on the 'good' side. For now.

You really need to speak to your broker about getting options. It's crucial. That way you would be able to hedge with calls on the deepest OTM call you can find. That way you would sleep well knowing your losses are limited and there is barely no chance of a margin call.

AMC is not worth 40$, 30$ or even 10$. These meme stocks will rot back to where they came from. It's a matter of when, and you need to be prepared to hedge and actively manage your position in order to end up with a profit.

Having said that, you shouldn't have been playing with things you don't know about. And with these amounts of money. Also, don't come to Reddit for investing advice. It's rampant with baffoons that think because they are spewing big words that they know what the fuck they're talking about. They are not. They are riding waves too big for them to ride, just like you are trying to do. They think they'll get off the wave just in time... And they don't. They never do. It's human nature.

None of this is financial advice. I'm a stranger writing from a smartphone. Good luck"
2021-06-01 21:16:51,stocks,"I don’t understand why when u had you 16 k withdrawn... you continue putting it back. Look You put 10 k. U gain 2-5 k. Cash out. You continue trading with your original 10 k. BUT DONT SPEND the withdrawal money. Keep them on a saving account. Every 1-3 months take out precentage out. If u have gambling problems do like that. If you work smart with the money you can use them to trade. Never ever chase the candle or go against the market.
Believe me FIRST 100 k are the hardest. I started with £300 in 1 year got 8 k. 2 years later 175 k. From which NON gme or amc. I use separate account for that game 😂until i made the 8 k believe me i could be on 18 k 😂 U have to accept the fact that if you don’t follow your analysis you will always loose. Forget about AMC GME BB NOKIA( Absolute sh*** for me as a stock and i will always be negative about it... personal opinion) SUNRUN VIACOMBCBS and etc. That’s heavily shorted and meme stocks. Do you actually think AMC is worth $40 ? A company on the brick of bankruptcy. New generation ( majority in here) don’t even knows how cinema looks like from inside. Ok GameStop is different stuff... they got pushed by Reddit users for a change. They are taking the advantage of upgrade. Strong analysis from them and etc. But still does it worth $600 ? No seriously be realistic... but i like the party and i support the lads against the hedges. Sometimes is good to follow hedges as well. Not all are bad hedgers... we are all in this game FOR MONEY. They don’t give you a medal for holding. DFV made a rally got his milions and i seriously admire him... hope to see him soon back. But i left wallstreetbets subreddit cause most of the stuff is spam and nonsense. Especially for their pump and dump stuff.... we are here all for money. No one gives free advices. But i told u how i did mine. Think. Use your head. You have brain in it! If u can’t understand statistics and analysis just hire someone to do it for u pay him 35% commission and hope one day not to f u up 😀"

2021-06-01 22:54:37,stocks,"I had an epic short battle; when the repo market got going berserk in late 2019, I started shorting the S&P.   I took losses, took losses, and took more losses.    But I was sure that there was a fundamental problem.  Then March 2020 hit.  I made a ton.   But it wasn’t because of the reasons I thought the market was overvalued.  So, as it rose, I bought 3x inverted S&P index funds.   I lost more than what I made by Christmas of 2020.   I now know, for a FACT, that this market is liquidity-driven.  There’s no way in hell, with inflation predictions and fake interest rates, that the stock market is worth what it’s worth.  BUT, I quit shorting it.   Why?  Because of Keynes’ famous quote saying: “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay liquid.”   Absolute truth.  You always pay a price for shorting.  It’s a tremendous disadvantage.  I’ll probably never do it again."

2021-06-01 21:27:06,stocks,"Hedge funds were decimated shorting meme stocks! You really think you can do better? Don’t mess with shorting stocks let alone AMC, now of all times. Take the loss and learn from it. 

Reading this I’m sure you’re going to bleed your account all the way down to zero if you don’t make some serious changes. You screwed up royally and your reasoning on how to fix this just shows you shouldn’t be trading.

You don’t have the traders psychology down and it’s killing your account."
2021-06-01 21:51:37,stocks,"I'll be straight with you. And if anyone who probably doesn't even have a position in the stock let alone a clue what's actually happening wants to redicule me I don't really care. 

There's every chance of this hitting triple figures by the end of this week. Obviously I don't have a crystal ball and can't guarantee that but it's a very strong possibility. 

And most of us long are in this to destroy shorters. And the stocks SI is only going up at the moment so they haven't even begun to cover. So we won't be going anywhere either for the foreseeable future. 

And the next time people want to take advantage of a global problem to try and destroy a company and put thousands of people out of jobs just to make money for themselves we will be right there to stop them. 

Consider that before shorting a ""meme"" stock in future. 

I'm not going to give you direct financial advice but if I was in your position id cut my losses and learn what I could from the experience. 

But you do you."
2021-06-01 21:29:16,stocks,"For what it's worth I feel your pain, I closed out my short earlier today knowing I likely won't be able to borrow the shares again. My retroactive advice, which definitely doesn't help you now, is to buy some cheap calls to put a finite limit on your losses on a short position. You can still do it now, but any calls worth  buying are extremely expensive right now.

If you have the margin available to keep the short open without blowing up your account, good luck. It just wasn't worth it for me when it looked like this was going to be another green week because I had to keep a ton of uninvested cash in my account due to the ridiculous margin requirements being enforced for an uncovered short position on AMC. After the dilutions AMC is really worth $2-$3 per share by next January in my opinion so being forced to close that position is just extremely hard to stomach."
2021-06-01 21:35:28,stocks,"So your shorted 800 shares at $26?
I would short em heavy on Friday! Remember 99% of these new followers don’t have any idea how options work to keep a price high and moving forward, this Friday they will sell out all their positions that expire come 930-955 since London closes at 10a with Paris an hour later, short it as heavy as possible and watch it tumble back into the $20’s but may be high 20’s this week around!! They let you short sell but you can’t do calls or puts, I had that problem once before.. To try to reposition yourself at this point is just a losing battle especially without trading options, wouldn’t be surprised if it hit $50 come Friday morning and go right down to $31-$24 by close! Be able to make money and cover your little mistake 🙏🏻🙏🏻"
2021-06-01 21:47:16,stocks,"Learn your lesson! Generally there is one good trade in a trend. If you try for 2 you are pushing your luck. Walk away after the first one. Then you lost me.

2021-06-02 12:39:37,stocks,"dude, i will say this as nicely as i can while making sure to get the point across. You shouldn't be day trading.

I've been in your shoes very early on when i started trading. If you are letting quick price action turn you around multiple times in the span of a few days, then you've already lost.

IV is way too high now to even dream about hedging with calls without locking in some substantial losses.

Personally, i don't think this rally is sustainable, but the real question is ""can you stomach seeing AMC at $70 without closing""? And can you do that without getting margin called? if you can, go ahead. if not it is time to close.

And truthfully, it sounds like you're now just trying to fomo to make that money back. #1 rule of market psychology. When you realize your losses, that money is gone. you are making new money after that. Dont revenge trade bad positions just to get that lost money back.

if you are closing, eat the loss and move on, unless you can truthfully tell yourself something materially changed to make you now bullish on something you were bearish on 1 week ago."

Options traders is literally like betting on a football team if it’s gonna win the league( my opinion ).

The short sellers still haven't covered their short positions in AMC or GME,  in fact I just read that more short positions (700,000) in GME were taken, so there will likely be another dip in price. But here are 3 cool things (in my opinion): 1) The due diligence in r/superstonk is valid, 2) shorts must cover their positions and 3) Apes aren't selling until they do.

2021-06-02 15:05:26,stocks,one thing i could suggest is that i don't know how good your understanding of options are but you can technically sell a covered put on your position. allowing yourself to recoup cost at the expense of  limiting (or killin) your upside.

So... what would be the difference for you to go the route and why someone would want to go the route I'd be going with securing a call options? Is it because in your setup you're not worried about it getting squeezed to some crazy number you'd have to cover, so would rather look to do the puts as you described to get extra gains while holding the short that's not going down to where you want to take profit/cover? 

Just got off the phone with Merrill and they said it probably won't be until tomorrow I'd be approved to make calls/puts. Not sure what I should do. Buy a little to cover (200 shares) and hedge half of what remains (1500) buy simply buy 750? Awful idea?"

2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Question about American stocks traded on foreign markets Yesterday NYSE was closed, and a favorite stock of mine had a good day in other markets. I was up late last night and watched it climb in the Frankfurt SE, which caused nice little jump at 4am in NYSE premarket.

I'm wondering how to find price action in international markets on American stocks while extended hours is closed, 8am-4am ET. I'm using Fidelity and Webull. With Webull it appears I can buy in Chinese markets, but I'm also curious about finding live price activity of American stocks in India and Europe. Any suggestions?

This makes me wonder how many people get up early enough to scan international markets prior to 4am for making premarket plays.  Any thoughts?"
2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"What should I do with my T shares? I have 482 T shares at an average of about $33/share. With the recent news and upcoming dividend cut I’m not sure what I want to do with my position. What do you all think?

Facts:
-Just bought a home
-Have consistent income and over 12 months savings aside from any investments

Reasons for selling:
-T is the only stock I’ve been consistently down money on 
-I can harvest the losses I have on T towards gains I’ve taken on other positions this year
-Loss of dividend growth 

Reasons for keeping:
-I like the direction the company has been going with HBOMax and now the WB deal
-Assuming T is eventually successful I enjoy a buildup of shares at low prices from. The dividend reinvestment 

Welcome all thoughts. Thank you!"
2021-06-01 20:02:43,stocks,"It depends on the reason why you bought it originally, if it's still valid, there is nothing wrong with keeping your shares or putting more in even.

For me personally, I bought in expecting stability and a regular dividend, to park extra cash somewhere for short-medium term. So when they announced the change of plans and that thesis went out the window, I immediately sold everything without looking back. Overall it was a couple % loss but such is life, mistakes happen."
2021-06-01 21:20:14,stocks,"I recommend keeping if you're investing long-term. T will get back it's dividend over time, most likely. I like their ability to solely focus on their telecommunications and expand 5G and Broadband service which should drive improved profit margins.

Additionally, the new Warner Bro. Discovery company has potential as a top 2 or 3 streamer that you'll get stock in, if you keep. 

If you truly want to get rid of it, you can transfer them all to my account :)"
2021-06-01 23:42:03,stocks,"I dumped 25K of T at cost when it was around $30. 

Without the dividend it's complete trash as a stock. I reallocated some to XLE to capture some alpha from inflation, and some to Verizon."
2021-06-02 00:44:50,stocks,Sell and reinvest is probably best. There are plenty of other stocks that fill a similar niche to T. BCE  comes to mind (Bell) which is similar to at&t but Canadian its listed on nyse though. I would look at telus too and maybe rogers.
2021-06-02 02:14:42,stocks,"Personally I think it’s a hold. Moved nowhere since I bought it but at least I had the dividend. I always thought a spin-off of their streaming and entertainment business could unlock value, so I’m waiting to see what comes of that. I don’t see it as a loser, just may stagnate until the market gets some clarity on the new entity."
2021-06-01 20:40:58,stocks,Sell immediately.    There are hundreds  upon hundreds of investments that are multiples better than the best case scenario for T.
2021-06-01 21:13:56,stocks,"Personally, holding since 29 in December. Don't listen to the crowd/sheeple. Do your own analysis. My analysis has shown that $T legacy cable/wireless division is trading at a lower multiple than VZ for no apparent reason other than bad optics. My analysis shows that HBOMAX trades at a lower multiple than NFLX and other streaming for no reason other than bad optics. It currently has better growth AND has higher ARPU. $T is a reopening play due to movies opening back up.

Based on sentiment dividend investors really don't like the debt and the growth required for HBOMAX so they picked VZ. Last quarter $T did better than VZ. Growth investors don't like legacy business and buybacks/dividend so they buy NFLX. $T was not getting credit from either ""market"" of investors. Now that the companies will separate they should.

HBOMAX +Disc becomes automatic \#1 streaming service in my opinion. HBOMAX is \#1 for movies and quality, discovery \#1 for ""dumb background"" TV. HBOMAX is JUST opening up to worldwide audiences.

At current price $T would yield 6-7% dividend IF they cut it. $T has NOT actually cut the dividend yet. Deal will take 1-2 years. Please correct me if I am wrong here.

You will see people on here celebrate AMZN, apple tv, Disney+, NFLx for one or two shows that are good. HBOMAX has the deepest library of all and just killed it last quarter. Friends, Matrix 4, Dune and international offering etc all to come.

The reason for $T divestiture is two-fold. Valuation multiple expansion for each separate business. No way regulatory agencies would have allowed discovery merger without a NewCo. NewCO allows for even more consolidation in future. Keep an eye on if VIAC or others become cheap as it becomes clear they are losers in the streaming wars. $NFLx has lost eye on ball. Stock buybacks at these insane valuations should be used to buy viacom or others. AMZN MGM deal shows how much the warner library is really worth. Thank cramer for dumping the price with his week long rant. Don't let potential 10% moves scare you out of a business trading at a huge discount AND growing.

  


TLDR HBOMAX+Disc \#1 Long term, $T legacy doing better than VZ right now, no dividend for 1-2 years."
2021-06-01 21:14:35,stocks,"ultimately it comes down to what you think the long term outlook of the 2 companies will be.

T is still going to have a good dividend for the  expected valuation of the new company (on par with the current dividend percentage wise, just on a smaller share price), which means the you need to decide if you're bullish on warner media or not (because when the dust settles, the current T shares will split into shares of both companies).

if you think warner media has a future, then just sit and hold. if you don't think so, then set a limit order to sell your T shares at a price that minimizes your losses before the end of the year. (the general rule of thumb of ""this trades at $30/share +/- $1"" will likely hold true for quite some time. (you bought into a run up and got burned. it likely won't go back up to your buy  in price any time soon). you can rebuy just T after the fact for around $15-20/share"
2021-06-01 23:44:29,stocks,"I’m holding a small position and will likely double up if we get near $25.  If the “new” AT&T stock can keep near 4% I’m happy to hold on to it, plus the HBO/discovery merger has good potential growth and should also be a decent dividend payer (like all streaming services) once the growth phase is complete."
2021-06-02 01:04:55,stocks,My plan is to hold it until they split off then unload my T into the other company.  I don’t love the discovery part of the company but I am a huge fan of Warner and think they will be much better off split.

2021-06-01 21:13:52,stocks,"But T holders will only own a percentage of Newcorp, rumored at 70%.  So you're not getting the full benefit of the merger."
2021-06-01 20:17:58,stocks,"Yea I find myself in a similar position. I bought it mostly for the dividend, and now with that compromised I’m questioning holding it. I think there is value in the company but it definitely bucks my original investing thesis for buying"
2021-06-01 20:25:22,stocks,"Is it really buying at a discount if management constantly makes poor decisions? I believe in finding value and growth prospects in an investment, but T in my opinion is a diminishing value proposition. Low top line growth, horrible balance sheet (even with the new deal it's not great) and absolutely awful management cleaning up after worse management. If you want income investments at a decent value look at some REITs instead imo, T just is not enticing enough as is. I just can't trust the management team which is a no go for me."

Where is the future catalyst coming from?  If it's not a value stock any more, it better have high growth potential.  I don't see it."
2021-06-01 20:49:43,stocks,"The way I recommend approaching it is taking a step back and reconsidering whether you would invest in them today. Imagine you didn't have any stake in them, does their stock still seem like an attractive opportunity? Is it undervalued, does it have room to grow, is the dividend still good, etc.

It's fine to change your thesis and allocation over time, as long as you avoid the sunk cost fallacy."
2021-06-01 20:35:14,stocks,"I am a big fan of REITs. T previously rounded out what will hopefully one day be the income side of my portfolio, but I agree it feels like diminishing returns"
2021-06-02 13:26:51,stocks,Thanks.
2021-06-01 21:08:47,stocks,I'm also holding waiting for a better buy in and load up. Ultimately AT&T is projected to own 71% of the spun off entity. There is long term value there but the initial pain will be felt. Also T has a big debt burden they need to fix. This and offloading DirecTV should get them closer. Going forward (this is a biggie) they need to stop making stupid mistakes not in their core business.

2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"FaceBook bearish sentiment Facebook short play. (Put options)

It’s safe to say a large percentage of the revenue Facebook makes is from iPhone users… because iPhones are the most popular cellphones in North America. (N/A highest consumer market)

IOS 14 update asks users if they want to allow apps to track their data. Most people will click ask app not to track, and you’ll notice in the days to come that most of your adds are less and less targeted. 
(Facebook did a study that shows 2% of users allow the app to track data, that’s 98% loss of continuous data collection, see link at bottom of page)

I think in Q2 when Google and/or Snapchat report earnings beating analyst expectations, people will price in Facebook doing so as well as they always follow trend.
When FB reports Q2 earnings, it will show up on the month of June. This will create lots of bearish sentiment against Facebook, additionally with inflation being in that talks this summer, the tech industry can see a hit.

Facebook should still be able to generate revenue from targeted ads, as they have data stored already. Although, as new trends and products enter the market, Facebook will lose its advantage as it’s stored data will be out of date. 

To add more…
Facebook has been trying to attack apple using every angle they can think of, even saying the new IOS update will “hurt” small businesses… that to me, shows me how desperate Mark Zuk is and how much this update will hurt Facebook.

Their ads are highly effective but that's largely due to machine learning and even if 50% (Apple smartphone share in US) of their most valuable data becomes dated they will still have plenty of data from non-Apple users to build advertising profiles against.

So why are they fighting it? For a bunch of reasons. It will be an annoying thing to have to re-engineer against. They want to win the PR battle and not be viewed as the bad guy in this story etc

Edit: This bearish position also doesn't seem to take into account any user growth, advances in the algorithms and product design to make ads more effective for both Apple and non-Apple users. Presumes no WhatsApp monetization and so on."

Their users will always be greater then before the pandemic, but it’ll likely drop compared to the lockdown peaks we’ve been seeing. As people start to go out more, and back to their offices they’ll spend less time on social media. 

FYI My play is a short term drop play. I see FB going to mid 200s this summer if not lower, before climbing back up slowly as they start to re-engineer."
2021-06-01 22:00:46,stocks,"Great post first of all! (Good content)

Although 80% of Facebook is from androids, that’s likely due to many android popular countries such as India, Brazil, Indonesia, etc… adds in those countries bring a lot less revenue. If you look at Facebook’s revenues, you’ll see that obviously the US makes up the largest revenue/profit. One thing we can agree on I think is that in the US, iPhones are the most popular. 

Yes I agree that everyone will suffer, although Google will not. Google is a competitor to Facebook, now that this happened, this puts Google in a strong position. They can sell data to Facebook, or simply keep them in the dark as people keep browsing the web etc.. 

I think Google (+ YouTube) and Amazon will be taking large shares away from Facebook. Amazon is scary, because I remember when I used to go on Google to search for things online, and I’d see amazon as the best option. Now I go on amazon and search for it. Additionally I stopped seeing my amazon items on Facebook (new update).

Additionally Tiktok is a scary one.. the newer generations are immune to traditional ads, and lots of them are seeing Instagram like some generations see Facebook. “For old people” … Or they might have it but barely use it. There’s definitely challenges to come in the near future."

2021-06-01 22:36:16,stocks,"I didn't see this thought - 

If you are a student, your income is likely low. Once you are off of your parent's return, take some gains, re-invest. When you take some gains and have a low or 0% bracket now, you are locking in money for the future. 

Example, when you file on your own. 

Buy $1,000 today. 

It goes to $2,000, but your income is in the 0% bracket - sell it and immediately buy something else similar, (or different if you want). You'll have to pay 0% of the $2,000-$1,000. your ""basis"" increased to $2,000

Next. Your $2,000 grows to $4,000, and you are still in the 0% bracket. Sell it and pay 0% of 4,000-2,000.  Reinvest. Basis grows to $4,000.

Eventually you get to $50,000 and your basis is $45,000, and have a job, and then maybe you have to pay 10% of 50k-45k instead of 10% of 50k-1k. 

Additionally, alternatively, if you collect dividends on it for years, and ""pay"" 0% on those dividends for years, you've collected a lot of tax free income."

2021-06-01 22:50:38,stocks,"I wouldn't take tax advice from any employee of a financial service firm. It simply isn't their job unless they are explicitly your tax preparer. 

The answer depends on short term vs long term gains (200k in sale proceeds could be zero gain or even a loss), your other income, filing status (married) and a few other factors like state taxes. If you want to share info or make a detailed post in r/tax someone will probably help."
2021-06-02 02:03:47,stocks,"You will get a nice long tax statement from your brokerage prior to tax time.  It will summarize your sales, realized gains and losses, cost basis, etc. and you’ll use this to input into TurboTax.  If your realized gains outweigh your losses, you’ll owe taxes per the tax code.  It is only realized when you sell it.  Transferring to your bank doesn’t matter, it is the sale within the brokerage account that counts as the sale.  If you are confused, you may benefit from going to an accountant to prepare your taxes.  And as others have stated, you’ll owe taxes on any Dividends received while you were holding any dividend paying stocks.  This will also be summarized on the brokerage statement."

2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, June 1, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 1, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly declining while the Dow Jones (DIA) gained roughly 0.1%. After a volatile beginning to the May, it seems over the past several weeks fears of fast rising inflation causing the Federal Reserve to prematurely tighten monetary policy have tempered. As I have said for weeks, I thought the selloff in the first two weeks of May, that saw the SPY lose 4% in a few days, was overdone, and am very encouraged by the price action in the market recently.

Last week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee once again reassured market participants that they see inflationary pressures as “transitory” and do not think a shift in monetary policy in the near-term is warranted. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

Looking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. 

**Highlights**

* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. 
* Construction spending rose only 0.2% in April over March, a sharp deceleration compared to March over February. Spending rose only 0.2% compared to 1% in March.
* “Meme stocks” continue their strong performance from last week, with AMC gapping up more than 20% again today. Crazy stuff!
* Coinbase (COIN) announced customers would be able to fund their account using Apple and Google wallets 
* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\*\***
* Dollar General (DG) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $226 to $231 at Buy. Stock currently around $203
* Goldman Sachs (GS) target raised by Piper Sandler from $385 to $420 at Overweight. Stock currently around $372
* Hess (HESS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $86 to $98 at Overweight. Stock currently around $84
* UnitedHealth Group (UNH) target raised by Bank of America from $450 to $522 at Buy. Stock currently around $412
* UPS target raised by Citigroup from $220 to $235 at Neutral. Stock currently around $215
* The Gap (GPS) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $36 to $38 at Hold. Stock currently around $33.4

2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"The process of Direxion's 3x ETFs? I have been keen on diversifying my portfolio for short-term trading. I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3nln0h/yatch_buyers_guide_direxions_3x_etfs_edition/) relative wsb post and did some research. It appears people do NOT tend to buy those specific ETFs.

Now I understand how these are bad long term investments after reading this [article](https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/2016-08-18/why-leveraged-etfs-are-horrible-investments) from us-news. But I am thinking of a short-term investment at least day trade or few weeks to at most 2 years.

Watched this [segment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-11-15/the-pros-and-cons-of-leveraged-etfs-video) on bloomberg on pros and cons of said ETFs. The representative also said that these ETFs are not good for long term investment. One of the ETFs, $GUSH which currently trades at \~$92 almost hit $100,000. It has low volume however has more than $750 million in assets. 

To anyone who has traded ETFs I wanted to ask:

1. How long do you usually hold them
2. Are there any decays applied to THESE ETFs. As some futures ETFs from proShare gets decayed.
3. Does Robinhood and fidelity charge fee for trading ETFs such as $LBAD or $LABU
4. Say if the ETF you hold goes to \~$100,000 per share, if you were to sell, who would possibly want to buy a share of ETF for $100,000?

Thank you!"

2021-06-01 23:23:58,stocks,"Note that leveraged ETFs are leveraged on a daily basis, not a weekly or longer term basis. So they reprice every day. The use of options etc imposes a cost which means that in the long run they rise less than 3x and fall more than 3x. They are thus designed for day training when you want to multiply small inter-day momentum.  They can be useful on a weekly or monthly basis during a bull market. They are not buy & hold."
2021-06-02 00:36:42,stocks,"I hold them indefinitely. The direxion x3 bulls do not have any built in decay. Robinhood does not charge a fee for them. None of them will naturally go to 100,000. SOXL got to 350 and did a 10:1 split. 

I hold LABU, YINN, DFEN, and SOXL and sell .15 delta covered calls on them every 2 weeks. The reason people don’t hold them long term is because most people can’t handle losing 80% of their money but you need to have faith in the long term."
2021-06-01 20:43:41,stocks,Or buy LEAPS on leveraged ETFs lol. $SOXL would come to mind here.
2021-06-02 01:39:41,stocks,"LEAPS are higher risk, higher reward. Achieving leverage with LEAPS literally results in your money going to $0 if the index it's tracking drops below your strike price and you're close to expiration. Leveraged ETFs don't do this because they only guarantee the advertised leverage on a day to day basis, so they don't crash quite as hard. You can wait out a leveraged ETF - it may take longer than the actual index it tracks, but it'll *eventually* come back from a crash. Not so with LEAPS - if it doesn't recover by the time it expires, you just lost every penny."
2021-06-02 06:51:13,stocks,you can buy deep ITM leaps to reduce both risk & leverage

Generally speaking it is a great product for the environmentally concerned as it uses far less water than almond milk. As water supplies dwindle and almonds become more of a target to cut back on water, we will see other forms forced to fill that gap which oat milk can easily do. That makes me believe oat milk is here to stay and Oatly is probably the biggest brand out there in that regard. Seems like it could be a winner but I’m still not interested as I don’t invest in stocks like this."

2021-06-02 00:00:00,stocks,"Facebook: A Bullish Analysis [Mix of Technical and Fundamental] # Price

Facebook currently trades at around $330. Its latest support is at around $296 to $300 and its latest resistance is actually around $330 so essentially the price that it's trading for right now. This is a crucial moment. If it manages to break $330, then we can see an upward movement going up to $360 which is the high ceiling of this channel that it has started forming. If you haven't invested yet, it could be a good time to wait for a couple of days or a week to see how its price will evolve. I have a feeling that it will start consolidating or it could slowly drop down to $315 or, worst case scenario, $300. It is currently trading above its 50D MA and its Relative Strength Index is near the top, but the volume is relatively low which makes me think that we probably won't see a lot of movement in the next week or two. However, as I said, I think that there is a good chance that we can see Facebook hitting $360 in a few months and maybe even $400 by the end of the year. Why? Well, Facebook has been delivering great results after great results. The fundamental performance of the company has been amazing so far. Absolutely amazing! In fact, out of ALL of its 20 earnings reports since 2016, it has only missed 1 and that was by 1 cent and it has only missed revenue ***twice***! The company outperforms analyst expectations and by a big margin, especially in the last 4 quarters. Last quarter, it beat analyst earnings expectations by 41%! This is massive! Especially for a company of Facebook's size! Essentially, what we are seeing is the pandemic boost in advertising that Facebook received was not as transitory as analysts expected. Also, there has been nothing but upward revisions for Facebook's Full Year 2021 earnings, which is a very good sign. 39 upward revisions in total! There have also been 23 upward earnings revisions for next quarter's earnings, which is almost always a good sign. Also, out of the 51 analyst covering Facebook in May, 45 have had a Buy or a Strong Buy rating!

# The Business

However, let's leave analyst opinions aside for the moment. They are good to gauge Wall Street's appetite for the company, but let's look at the business, at the fundamentals. Is Facebook really a good company? Facebook's main source of revenue are the ***advertising revenues that*** come from ads on its products, the Facebook app and website, Instagram, Whatsapp and Messenger. By gathering user data, Facebook is able to offer targeted ads which are obviously more expensive, but are also more attractive to advertisers. Even though regulators have reduced the amount of data that Facebook can gather and therefore reduced its ability to target specific audiences through its ads, the company has still managed to grow its advertising business by a LOT! Another reason why the company has done so well is because it operates the 7th most website in the world, Facebook, which is also the 2nd most visited social media website behind YouTube. Instagram is extremely popular as well, ranking in the 23rd place! As of the latest quarter, the Daily active users of Facebook's family of products are 2.72 BILLION with the number of monthly active users being 3.45 BILLION or more than 10 times the population of the US! This is literally half of the world's population! Facebook is still seeing growth in user numbers with its total user base up 15% year-on-year which is actually faster than last year's increase of 11%. So, we can see that their user base is growing, but is that translating into higher revenues? The answer: yes! In 2020, Facebook reported a 20% year-on-year advertising revenue increase, but in their last quarter alone, the advertising revenue increase was 46% compared to last year! Advertising makes about 98% of Facebook's revenue so we can see that the company is getting a serious boost in overall profits. Their net income also grew by 58% in 2020 year-on-year and an astonishing 94% in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to last year! Essentially, we can see that Facebook is reporting some serious growth for a megacap company and it is largely due to the increase in their advertising business. However, Facebook are also involved in Virtual and Augmented Reality through their Reality Labs. While this side of Facebook is still tiny, it is reporting a serious growth in revenues as well. In the first quarter of 2021, its revenue grew by almost 150% as compared to last year and now makes up 2.7% of Facebook's revenue! VR and AR are still relatively young industries, but they are growing fast as we can see. Market researchers claim that the industry will grow at an annual rate of 42% from $37B in 2019 to an astonishing $1.27T in 2030! Facebook is one of the leaders in this space along with Apple, Microsoft and Samsung so this represents a massive opportunity for the tech giant and yet another solid bullish argument for Facebook. Unlike its competitors, Facebook's business is relatively concentrated so I think this gives the company a competitive advantage when it comes to growing its VR and AR business. The company has also grown its headcount by 30% in 2020 so we can see that it is doubling down on expansion and growth. Despite that, analysts are only expecting a revenue and earnings growth of about 15% annually for the next 3 years. To some extent, that is justified as Facebook did get a big bump in earnings due to COVID. However, I think that their estimates lean towards the conservative side and I think that Facebook can actually achieve a growth of between 20% and 25%, especially when we consider the VR and AR business. This may sound optimistic, but given Facebook's record of beating analyst estimates, I am okay with sounding optimistic. The only hurdle that Facebook may run into is regulation, which is always on the table for big tech companies like it. However, it has has a record of successfully dealing with regulation and continuing to deliver good results despite of it so I'll take my chances.

# The Balance Sheet

Now, you may be thinking, great, Facebook is positioned well for the future, but how are the fundamentals looking right now? We can see they are growing, but can they support that growth? Personally, I think so. Facebook has a tremendous balance sheet and a massive stockpile of cash and cash equivalents. They currently have just over $64B as of 31th March 2021 which represents a $2-2.5B increase from the end of December 2020 and an increase of almost $10B since December 2019. The huge cash positions means that Facebook has enough capital to expand without being worried about financing, it means that it can buy new companies to help its expansion or to prevent competition, but most importantly, it means that the company is doing well. We can also see that in the company's share repurchase program. Facebook has repurchased $6.3B of shares in 2020 and $4.2B of shares in 2019 and, in January 2021, it authorized an additional $25B of stock repurchases so the total right now is about $34B. This doesn't mean that they will repurchase all $34B, but that they can. Still, the fact that they have authorized that programme is a positive sign. In addition to their massive stockpile of cash, Facebook only has liabilities of $30B or less than half the size of its cash stockpile. What does that mean? It means that Facebook is healthy and it's taking its vitamins. The company is solid and is more than able to tackle any short- or medium-term challenges to its business. It has no long-term debt, meaning that if they do decide to borrow money, they will be able to do so at much better rates than some of its rivals.

# The Ratios

Then, if we look at some the fundamental ratios, we can see that Facebook is. A. Beast! Their Return-on-Assets is 20.3% compared to the industry's average of 10.3% and their Return-on-Equity was 25.3% last year! Lets compare it to its rivals. I think that the companies closest to Facebook in terms of business are Twitter, Google, and Snapchat although Snap is in very early stages of growth. In terms of ROA and ROE, both Snapchat and Twitter are negative so there's not much point in comparing them, but Google has a 15.3% ROA. Their ROE is also lower at 22.3% as opposed to Facebook's 25.3%. Now, Facebook's forward Price-to-earnings ration is only 21.6 whereas Google has 25.5, Twitter's is 52.4 and Snapchat has a Forward PE of 92, so again, Facebook turns out to be the best price for its projected earnings. In terms of current PE, Facebook has 28.2, Google has 32.2 and Snapchat and Twitter don't have one because they are unprofitable. The current S&P average PE is 37.2 so we can see that both Facebook and Google are under the market average although Facebook is again cheaper. What these ratios tell us is that Facebook is not only operating a very efficient business, but it's also at a very good price relative to its peers. Even looking at it historically, Facebook has rarely dropped below a PE of 27-28 so the current price is, again, excellent and cheap. This is my own opinion, feel free to do your own research, but according to my personal EPS growth we can expect a roughly 12% annual return on Facebook over the next 10 years if we buy it at $330. That is assuming a 15% earnings growth next year which will taper off and assuming that we can sell it at a PE ratio of around 30-32. If the earnings grow at around 20% next year, then we can look at a roughly 15% annual return which is higher than the average return of the S&P 500, meaning that Facebook is likely to beat the market, at least in my opinion.

&#x200B;

What do you guys think? I'm sure that I've missed something in my analysis, but I think that I've covered the main bits. It can obviously be more detailed so I'll be happy if you can point out any gaps :)"

Sorry if this part throws cold water on your venture, but one thing I thought of is that people sometimes make copies of their stock certificates when they sign them over to someone else. Old certificates had a statement on the back and place for signature to assign the stock to someone else. You actually signed the original certificate and handed it to the person. People would make copies so they had some record of what they had and transferred. That may be the case here. Or, maybe your great great grandfather was just careful and wanted to have a copy in case he lost the original. I hope that's actually the case and it's worth billions! Best of luck."

Just didn't think one was going to occur until later (I was actually looking for a brief, sharp dip, sharper than the ones we've seen in 2021 so far this month until that stock rout that happened on May 12th, now I don't think it will be sharper if that routine monthly pullback does happen), but I'm less certain now, the S&P and Dow are taking too long at legit breakout attempts to me it feels after they regained their footing from the stock rout from the second week of May.

For instance, G ME was believed to potentially make a comeback, esp once Ryan Cohen took over, and the online gaming world. There were a few under the radar thesis posts shared on Reddit about a year ago, talking about why it could potentially be a great stock, and was actually heavily downvoted when originally written. AMC some bought last year after the crash, thinking movie theaters would rebound back, once pandemic ended and lockdown opened up again. Thankfully with the stock market, regardless of votes, everyone can form their opinions, the money is all there as proof, many early movers are now in prosperity, and doubters are now in fomo lol, but idea pretty much is before all these, they actually had pretty reasonable investment fundamentals."

Coincidentally, our Model S is (again) in for service for 12v battery replacement. It's kind of infuriating that they couldn't just use a normal AGM battery like everybody else, so we have to bring it in every 2-3 years for replacement.

For example, we haven't updated our car software for a long time  because every update seems to be designed to highlight the features of the newest models, and the dash display gets re-arranged every time in IMO unpleasant ways. For example, the literal battery % charge display got pushed into a corner of the digital dash screen instead of being displayed prominently like it used to be. 

Back to our annoying issue: that means the mobile app couldn't connect to the car. Big issue is that unless it connects, we can't make service appointments. So I had to go through their online chat to schedule an appointment, and I'm still having issues communicating with the service staff (even though they have our car right now as i write this comment). You can look up your local service centers and try calling the number - the phone tree in our area always redirects us to the app, which means there's literally nobody to talk to.

In terms of services:  
accelerated the rollout of several strategic initiatives, including the launch of eGift cards and personalized products, the introduction of service innovations like telehealth offering, Connect with a Vet, and compounding services, and the opening of first automated and first high-velocity fulfillment centers

Revenue:

Exceeding $2 billion of quarterly net sales 

Customers:

added 1.4 million net active customers in the fourth quarter and ended the year with 19.2 million active customers

Not just reseller:

our proprietary brand's penetration increased 570 basis points year over year to reach 21%,

Pets:

The number of pet-earning households increased by 5.7% in 2020, a significant acceleration from the pre-pandemic five-year CAGR of 0.6%

They care about their customer service and employees in general:

in 2021, we will invest approximately $60 million in higher wages and benefits, the bulk of which will be directed to our fulfillment and customer service team.

  
CONS:

obviously they know that pet adoption is going to slow down. 

&#x200B;

Edit: Not to be a dick, but you completely ignored the balance sheet on both of your valuation writeups altogether. I think it's extremely important when valuing a company, that you take into account debt load and balance sheet health, and cash on hand. Basically, we have no idea that if Petco's in-store sales eventually flutter and overhead becomes a burden as it already is, they now become chewy.com 2.0, and have 'no moat' either... This isn't a strictly metric-driven valuation; it moves more to overall business structure and the liability of a traditional brick-and-mortar business trying to be something that someone is already 5x better at."

2021-06-01 21:45:51,stocks,"With covered calls, you're selling someone the right to buy your shares at a certain price (known as a strike price). So if you sell me a covered call with a 15 dollar strike price and an expiration date of 6/4, it means that I can purchase 100 of your BB shares for $1500 (15*100) at any point in time between now and Friday.

Obviously I'm not going to exercise the call if the stock price stays below 15 dollars a share, so if that happens the calls expire worthless and I basically just gave you money for no reason. But if the stock price rises to $25, you bet your ass I'm going to exercise the option and force you to sell me the shares at 15 bucks a pop. So basically, by selling the covered call you're capping your upside at 15. You're still kind of screwed if the stock price plummets (although you still get to keep whatever I paid you). 

Covered calls are generally best if the stock trades relatively flat. Then you can keep selling covered calls every week to make a really nice income (**especially** for BB) and you also get the keep the shares. I also like using them to exit a position at a certain price. Just keep selling covered calls until the price rises above the strike price and your shares get called away."
2021-06-01 21:00:58,stocks,Hmm now it’s got me thinking. Why would they step into the EV auto market. And then crypto? Wait are they just associating themselves with trending sectors?  - long term aapl holder

2021-06-02 17:50:32,stocks,"I disagree. What is there to justify the PE? Sure, it’s a safe pick which justifies a slightly higher PE, but I doubt apple has much growth potential left, since they’re already the highest market cap in the world. It’s like people look at other companies having even higher PEs and thinking ‘well 27 is one of the lower ones, so it must be cheap’ but that’s not how things work. The market is in general very expensive right now. That makes sense since the fed is doing expansive fiscal and monetary policies, but this won’t last forever. There’s no way Being ‘unique’ is gonna justify a PE of 27 IMO"

Or, AMC might just stay at $30, issue more shares, use that money, buy out Regal and some others, and turn a profit. 

Sorry you got mixed up in an ""advanced"" strategy with a highly volatile meme stonk. Hedgefunds have lost Billions in AMC, GME, and such. 

I'm not sure how you qualified for shorting if you don't qualify for buying options. 

I've been trading for 25 years off-n-on, and I've never shorted, never sold a naked call. I always have a finite loss possibility. 

Everyone will give you lots of advice. 

BTW, just been booking a road trip vacation and hotel prices went up double from last week. Some of them went up $50 while we were looking. Reservations for everything are also filling up. Good luck. 

YMMV. This is not advice."

You could open a fidelity account to trade options there. A bit easier to get approved. Problem there, markets are efficient and implied volatility is so high that buying options are going to be expensive. Haven’t looked at this, but I also assume your borrowing costs on your short positions are pretty high. I agree that AMC will likely drop but I thought the same with GME too. I would have figured this circus would have been over in March. Not sure if your financial position but it’s sometimes better to walk away with something rather than risk it all and end up with nothing when you’re investing. There’s clearly irrational moves happening in those few stocks but as long as demand to buy outweighs sellers, that will continue. Who knows."

Looking a CCL...I looked at the three year trend in stock prices. Note that even pre-covid it had a downward trend.  But when I first looked at it I felt it belonged 45-50 post covid and it was trading at 12.35. I bought in. There was some ships out there with bodies on them that ports would not allow them to come in to, because of covid outbreaks on board.  The stock dropped, I bought more at $8.15.  since then, they diluted the stock shares. They used to have about 700 million shares, now they have a billion.  They also took on some debt to get past the pandemic.  My current thought is that shares are way overvalued for where they are currently at (barely sailing overseas, not at all in the states).  They are still losing money every month, and the stock is trading over $30. With the share dilution, and the new debt, I figured when they were up and running they would be somewhere between 35 and $40.  My thought was if they stabilized around 40 I would sell. My Hope was that once they started sailing there would be a spike up around 50, and I would sell at that point. Why it's over 30 now, no idea... But it would take a lot at this point for me to lose the gains I've made. Do I think there's still money to be made in carnival, yes.  More so a couple weeks ago when it was trading at around 25.  If I was not already in it, I don't know that I would get in it now. 

The second time I purchased into carnival, I also purchased into RCL.  It was trading at $29 a share.  It did a lot better at handling the pandemic in my opinion, compared to carnival.  They did not dilute as much, but did take on debt. It was running pretty steady pre-covid, I think trading about $130 a share if I remember correctly.  Same thought, they have a bunch of debt now, I don't think they belong at 135, and I don't think they belong at 97 right now when they are barely sailing. Is there money to be made in Royal Caribbean stock still, yes.  But again, if I wasn't already in it, I don't know that I would jump into it now.  Why is it at $97 when they are bleeding money? 

Probably not the answers you're looking for...but in short, what I did when I got in, was I looked at past (pre-covid) trend lines of the stock prices, compared that to current stock price, and looked for any news I could find about what was going on with the company. I also didn't think the pandemic would put cruises out of business as long as they did. Now do that for BA..."
2021-06-02 19:49:51,stocks,Option trade is volatile. Set a take profit percentage and either sell half or sell all. I use 30% as my mark.
2021-06-02 19:55:50,stocks,"Yes, you would reinvest profits. And you’ll get the big ones but don’t trade chasing the big one. Trade for reasonable profit. Set stop loss or trail stop. Let winners run of course. But focus on consistent gains rather than high risk high reward."
2021-06-02 19:45:47,stocks,I track my trade separately and do a weekly gains chart. Goal is to have green bars on my chart. You maintain that consistency. It’s rewarding to see that each week you’re making the same or more as previous. Just one strategy; you can use whatever works for you. Explore different ways to track.
2021-06-01 23:49:05,stocks,"I am using degiro, very good and safe option"
2021-06-02 00:02:09,stocks,"This is more opinion than fact but I think it's likely those just starting off are more likely to invest money they shouldn't be. It's great how easy it is to invest now, the problem is underestimating risk tolerance and your ability to ride out job loss or emergencies that require you to withdraw investments near a bottom. When markets crash and the economy tanks is precisely when many would need extra cash."

2021-06-02 14:23:11,stocks,Would you have a well-researched article about this? Especially the 'over advertise' and 'steal IP' bits. Only negative stories I found via Google was the well-known privacy concerns (i.e. with their phones).
2021-06-02 14:44:23,stocks,"I use to do consulting work to allow US companies to reach foreign markets namely China for both production and to market goods there. While I don’t have any of my old briefs I know that the state department has some handy guides hosted on the USPTO site. 

You also aren’t going to find “articles” on this since international trade a) a multi billion dollar industry protected by a few and b) China doesn’t want bad news getting out."
2021-06-02 15:55:10,stocks,"Hm. If the crime is significant enough, I cannot believe that there haven't been solid leaks = reports yet about this. China can block as much as they want, once something reached the www, it usually remains accessible for the rest of the world somehow somewhere.

Stealing IP should become quite obvious when comparing products, for instance. It's been a known, default Chinese crime anyway and probably applies to any Chinese company in some way. Wondering if Xiaomi is sticking out here for some reason.

And over advertising.. on second thoughts, could you elaborate on what you mean by that?"
2021-06-02 15:57:36,stocks,It’s not a crime there…
2021-06-02 15:03:23,stocks,"EDIT: I just learned a bit about China stocks and I ended up liquidating all of them. Turns out, US investors cannot own Chinese stocks at all. The ADR's we are buying, like BABA, do not actually hold real stock. 

Rather they are a contracts only and AFAIK are considered illegal by China thus they can easily state that they dont convey at any time. To make matters worse, most are in the Caymans so we cant even go after them for damages if China cancels them all.

Dunno about you guys, but I am not willing to play that game. Either China opens access to the stocks or we should get out."
2021-06-02 15:40:39,stocks,Hope you kept your calls. I made quite a bit today and closed my position.
2021-06-02 17:26:34,stocks,Yeah I sure did. Still have them but going to exercise probably. I’m up like 5000%
2021-06-02 17:30:20,stocks,"Congrats on the win! Just remember, it isn't real till it's in the bank. Good luck moving forward! My last position is $NVDA for the stock split. It's almost done though I think. That's been an epic ride."
2021-06-02 17:32:24,stocks,Yeah I’m definitely frozen figuring out what to do lol
2021-06-02 17:33:43,stocks,"Hard choice. For me, I always take multi baggers off the table and let a % of the profits ride on a long shot. I've lost too many multi baggers due to my own greed.

Make the decision you know you'll be okay with. If you lost it all right now, how would you feel?"
2021-06-02 17:39:09,stocks,Pretty bad lol I’m thinking maybe selling a call and exercising another and letting it ride. I’ll make $5k but I really would be sad if this went higher and higher and I’m out. No way I’m buying options now. They are ridiculously expensive
2021-06-02 17:42:19,stocks,Sounds like greed talking to me. Things can always go higher. You're right though. It totally could. I don't get attached to tickers personally. Something is always going up and something is always going down.
2021-06-02 17:44:22,stocks,"I mean I’ll keep some in it for sure. I have to ride it out 
Technically already playing with house money with the previous options I’ve made"
2021-06-02 17:45:19,stocks,"Fantastic. Sounds like you've got some risk management then. (Something wsb hasn't had in a year lol)

Best of luck friend. I hope you make a killing."
2021-06-02 17:47:09,stocks,"Ha yeah they embody Ferrari or Food Stamp

And I appreciate it. Let’s see where this goes"
2021-06-02 15:54:56,stocks,This aged extremely poorly.
2021-06-02 15:57:30,stocks,Or just five days lol
2021-06-01 23:28:12,stocks,LOL go back to r/GME you’re the retail “investors” he’s talking about
2021-06-02 10:25:32,stocks,what does it mean 3x leveraged?
2021-06-02 10:42:45,stocks,"You invest $1, they borrow $2 with it and invest $3."
2021-06-01 20:54:50,stocks,My son told me back in January to buy AMC and FINALLY its doing something!
2021-06-02 19:58:29,stocks,"They wouldn't let me post this elsewhere, but looking for some advice. Fairly new to options and I sold 2-$22 covered calls on BB expiring 6/18...should I wait it out or buy them back? I think I collected 2.20 ea and now about 3.28 ea. Not sure I would want them exercised if it gets that high. Do I spend the $200 now to exit? What do you think? Thanks"
2021-06-02 11:56:35,stocks,"you started with a few hundred and now sitting at $80k? please teach me!!! lol
I also started at $300, now I'm at $700+ but I need help. I'm kinda new, only doing this 1-2 years but I'd love some advice. oh and I did the same, using RH but I'd like an alternative place to invest me little bit of money"
2021-06-02 14:54:41,stocks,"To be clear, I started with a few hundred in my RH account but of course added more as time went on and I started to see returns. I've invested a little over 32k in the past 4 years, so about 140% return. 
  
I got lucky buying SHOP @ $50 and AMD @ $10, but otherwise I just invest every 2 weeks in blue chip stocks and never sell. My portfolio is SHOP, SQ, AMZN, NVDA, MSFT, AMD, AAPL, NFLX, FB, WM, OTLY, DIS, BOTZ."
2021-06-02 08:58:53,stocks,"Uhm, yea, I'm not driving a hatchback bro."
2021-06-02 12:04:33,stocks,"You’re right everyone should get to buy exactly what they want since it’s their money, which includes giant gas guzzling trucks."
2021-06-02 12:10:30,stocks,"I think my point WAS, this truck is a good alternative for those of us who would LIKE to have a full size pickup but don't want one of those ""gas guzzling"" trucks, which I do currently own, but it's not for daily use. I wouldn't mind having a full size truck for daily use, so this would be a environmentally responsible alternative."
2021-06-01 23:03:15,stocks,LFAP is currently on the rise.  CNN just posted about them and the parent stock LGBT is part of nasdaq so what is everyone's speculation on this stock especially since its pride month
2021-06-02 04:54:37,stocks,But doesn't Soy have this area covered? There is also rice milk which similar in being watery like nut milks.
2021-06-02 05:06:39,stocks,"This is where it gets into taste/opinion but imo oatmilk (and oatly in particular) tastes vastly superior to soy and rice milk. I could actually drink a glass of oatly where I'd really only use soy or rice milk in a recipe or maybe in a smoothie.

As for sustainability here's the rankings: [BBC Graphic](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fscience-environment-46654042&psig=AOvVaw3NJOeOnK6KLvIxQceg0fKQ&ust=1622711111816000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCOio2o7M-PACFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)  


So they're basically equal on sustainability, but imo oatmilk is superior in taste."
2021-06-02 05:12:25,stocks,"Thanks so Soy and Oats around the same on the rankings overall. I never understood how Almond milk got so popular in the last few years it tastes terrible and use so much water. I feel like Oatly is a bit too narrow in they only do Oat products, other manufacturers seem to have various lines using dairy alternatives. It's on my watchlist but not sure I will ever buy stock unless it drops closer to $10."
