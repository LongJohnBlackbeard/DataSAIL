2021-05-29 19:25:54,stocks,Who cares dude. Other people making poor decisions in the stock market is what creates opportunity for you to make money.
2021-05-29 19:29:07,stocks,"Everybody is a genius in this market, you could randomly pick a stock on the Nasdaq last year and it probably returned close to 50%. All these ""brovesting"" just go with the flow, they choose whatever stock is popular at the moment.  

When we get the next bear market i promise these channels will disappear, then again we maybe never see another one who knows"
2021-05-29 19:40:31,stocks,"Many Youtubers do this, in fact there are a few really popular YouTuber‚Äôs with thousands/ millions of subscribe  that release half assed investment ideas out to their subscribers imo. 

I personally don‚Äôt blame them, I don‚Äôt think their viewers want to watch a 1-2 hour long video doing an in depth DD on a company along with actual financial analysis. I also believe people who do this wouldn‚Äôt want to share their work with others - at least I wouldn‚Äôt want to. It‚Äôs also
Impossible to do such in-depth analysis of companies to pump out videos on a regular basis. 

On a good note, they provide a very brief analysis for you if you are lazy and don‚Äôt want to do it. It also introduces people to the stock market, which imo a good thing if they continue to pursue further knowledge on investing or even just buy ETFs."
2021-05-29 19:34:51,stocks,"I've been watching quite a few 'coin' videos this weekend and this is spot on.  There are some that are balanced with good info... most are selling stories laced with what I would call 'bullying' language, e.g. 'only the weak sell'.  

And they interlace their videos with 'proof' in the form of graph analysis/overlays that mean nothing... simply finding numbers/patterns that fit their narrative if you squint your eyes just right.  

Then there's the language/codes.... 'Diamond Hands', 'FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt)', 'Whales trying to take your coins'...   

It makes you want to gag."

2021-05-29 19:36:19,stocks,"That reminds me of the big poker phase from the mid-2010's or so. Everyone was really into poker, the World Series of Poker was a big deal, people were making a lot of money. 

People who won a little money playing poker online would come to Vegas and sit at the high money tables and get *absolutely fucking destroyed*. I feel like the same thing is happening with stocks now. All these kids are thinking they're taking on hedge funds who've been in the game longer than they've been alive. 

A reckoning is coming soon, and it's not ""the hedgies"" who are going to lose. Here's why: Billionaires don't go all-in. The people who are dumping their entire life savings into meme stocks are going to learn a valuable lesson about not investing more than you can afford to lose. Because the hedge fund guys can bankrupt their companies and they'll still be rich. That's the difference between them and retail investors who go all-in."
2021-05-29 19:47:20,stocks,"Yeah, but the more idiots that join in, the longer stupid shit happens in the market which causes bigger dislocations later. Just look around at what's going on. It's not going to end well.

Before you say -- this gives an opportunity to make money, please look at put option prices in various meme stocks. You have to get timing perfect and it's impossible to tell when the idiots will shift sentiment. And if you outright short these stocks... good luck with that."

2021-05-29 18:59:51,stocks,"The first thing to do is find how many (if any) stock splits happened. You could own more than 50.

https://chevroncorp.gcs-web.com/split-texaco

Looks like there was a 2 for 1 in 97. So you owned 100 shares.

But then there was a. 77 conversion. So you own 0.77*100 shares = 77 shares of chevron.

Chevron is at 103 so this is about 7000 ish worth of stock.

I do not know how to turn that into an electronic holding in a brokerage though. Good luck!"
2021-05-29 19:06:43,stocks,"Keep us posted how this ends up, pretty cool way to find out you own stock"
2021-05-29 18:59:51,stocks,They were worth $50 a share in 1984.
2021-05-29 18:56:29,stocks,Yes Chevron owns Texaco
2021-05-29 19:02:50,stocks,From my sleuthing it looks like two 2-1 splits and a 1-1 for a share of CVX for each share between the other 2-1 splits. However that works.

2021-05-29 19:08:57,stocks,Will do!
2021-05-29 19:04:08,stocks,"If that website I posted is correct, the other split was in 1969 so that wouldn't apply to your stock if it was from 84. You'd get the 97 double but then the 0.77 in 01."

2021-05-29 18:21:48,stocks,"I think VGRO/XGRO are both solid options. They've been underperforming recently with bonds being terrible, but over time they're a solid low-risk way to diversify and grow your portfolio. If you want a higher risk, XEQT/VEQT are both solid options too.

These all track global markets, so if you'd prefer to focus on NA companies then these aren't for you"
2021-05-29 18:40:08,stocks,Voo has been doing well for me. Up 10% so far this year.
2021-05-29 18:25:33,stocks,"what would be the pros and cons of focusing exclusively on NA companies vs global markets?

Sorry if that's a dumb question lol"
2021-05-29 18:49:43,stocks,"No problem, basically if you invest in something like VSP that's just US based, you're assuming that the US markets will perform the best, and while that's been true recently, it hasn't always been the case. By diversifying into European and emerging markets, you hedge against the possibility that other markets outperform North America.

XGRO/VGRO are still mostly focussed on NA, but having the emerging market exposure is just added diversity/safety"
2021-05-29 18:14:03,stocks,I feel like you have to decide before even entering. For anything expiring in two weeks or less it is 15-25% unless I‚Äôm sure I can stomach a corresponding loss.

2021-05-29 19:57:00,stocks,I got greedy on a 10x and only sold 5 percent. Ended up losing the rest.
2021-05-29 18:23:20,stocks,"I‚Äôve found much more success with quick profit taking then holding out for home runs. 

I currently take :

-1/3 off at 5% and move the stop to break even

-1/3 off at 10% 

-Let the next 1/3 run, moving my stop up to structural levels. 

This is pretty good for me with the strategy I use (support bounces for ranging high beta stocks)

I would suggest implementing a profit taking strategy and tracking the results. Use the strategy that gives you the highest EV per trade. Definitely, definitely have a plan."
2021-05-29 19:49:58,stocks,You've been making money these past 3 months?
2021-05-29 18:12:49,stocks,"First of all it‚Äôs still great if you sell with profit but before the top (since you‚Äôll never know what‚Äôs the top), conservative profit taking is always better than losing money. My personal approach when I have multiple calls is to not sell/close all at once. Let‚Äôs say I buy 3 calls, they triple in value that‚Äôs for me in my situation a good point to sell one of them to make sure that even if they expire worthless I didn‚Äôt lose any money. Then whenever it‚Äôs the right time you can sell the other ones if you like the value at that point. I know the feeling I missed also some profits by selling early or too late. And another factor is my believe in the company, did I do the research or is it more of a gamble. Big difference as well. Interested to read other peoples approaches."
2021-05-29 19:48:53,stocks,These days as long as anything hits green I sell no matter what and get out lol
2021-05-29 18:37:27,stocks,".........250%. 

Hahahahahah. Like? Bro????

I'm thinking about selling a 30% gain from my AMC put. Haha. I knew it was going to drop from 35. And it'll go lower. But I'm itching to sell cause my buy was an out of the money put cause I didn't want to spend $800 on the $35 contract. 

\[Although. I'm kicking myself. Because a $35 contract with a closer closing date would be printing me. ARGHHHH!\]"
2021-05-29 19:06:15,stocks,Maybe next time if you feel its gonna keep running set an aggressive trailing stop loss. But those gains are strong. Don't beat yourself up.
2021-05-29 18:14:24,stocks,"You should have a target price in mind before you buy. Otherwise you haven‚Äôt calculated your reward/risk ratio and have no idea how safe or risky your trade is. 

This is harder to to with options, admittedly. Because the contract price isn‚Äôt a linear relationship to underlying price, it‚Äôs hard to predict potential % gain/loss. Instead, I would use the underlying price action. Sell when your technical analysis indicates the underlying price has peaked"
2021-05-29 19:03:58,stocks,You don‚Äôt have to sell it all to make gains.  Sell enough to break even plus some money to enjoy life then set a stop loss and let the rest ride.  Don‚Äôt forget taxes.
2021-05-29 19:42:22,stocks,"I had apha calls that I sold for like a $80 profit. Had I waited a few days I would‚Äôve made like 1200.

2021-05-29 19:57:12,stocks,You can‚Äôt be hard on yourself for taking a profit and then seeing more profit that was left on the table. You had no idea that wild happen and it could‚Äôve gone the other way. You would have to be extremely fucking lucky to exit at the absolute peak. Can‚Äôt feel bad about making money my friend.
2021-05-29 18:03:46,stocks,I did the same thing recently... I sold my calls in the am for a decent price 2 days early and had I waited 5 hrs longer the share prices rose $10 in the afternoon. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2021-05-29 18:47:31,stocks,"Bro just let your winners run. And cut your losses short. that's it. You won't be having "" i missed out on xx gains coz i sold early"""
2021-05-29 19:29:16,stocks,">This has happened a lot to me recently and I know I‚Äôm being a good boy

You're not being a good boy by making the wrong decisions. You're making mistakes. Nobody can criticize you for that, but they *can* criticize you for claiming your mistakes were actually good decisions. You need to be saying ""I know I messed up"" not ""I know im being a good boy.""

>Do you all have a specific target profit you look for before bailing on a call?

Absolutely not. Why would I base buy and sell decisions on an arbitrary number only I know? How is that going to help me predict whether the thing is going to go up or down?

If Bill buys for $1 and Jill buys for $1.50, and they have a rule to take a 100% profit, what should they do when it hits $2? Bill should sell but Jill should hold? They both have $2 so they both stand to gain or lose the same amount. So how can they have contradictory guidance? Only one can be right.

If your rule produces contradictory guidance for identically situated individuals, it is not a valid rule.

When you sell something, it better be because you think it'll go down next week, not because you know it went up last week. Otherwise, you're trading emotionally, not logically."
2021-05-29 19:53:19,stocks,"Selling 100 shares of TSLA presplit  at 350 and I was happy with picking up $1500 in gains over 3 days ;)

Luckily had another 150 shares that I have managed to hold"
2021-05-29 19:42:36,stocks,"My profit taking is usually in line with support and resistance levels depending on which direction I'm playing. Sell calls at resistance and sell puts at support (before they start bouncing back the other way). If it shows signs of blowing past those levels, I hold a bit longer. If it starts to to struggle, I secure profit. If it starts to run again, I just reenter. If I don't have a day trade to get back out and secure profit the second time I'll turn it into a ghetto spread and close it the next day. 

I feel your pain though. I lost track of how much money I've left on the table being disciplined and smart. But, I'll agree with everyone else it's much, much better than taking a loss and just knowing you stuck to your plan and stayed disciplined feels great."
2021-05-29 18:31:51,stocks,just last week on roblox. I was kind of sick of seeing the stock in my portfolio so I set limit at $78 and it just sold. Now RBLX worth 93.77.

2021-05-29 19:05:42,stocks,What did you buy exactly? I picked up $19 6/18 Put after the price had already dropped down to about 25$ on Friday. Hoping the sell off continues on Tuesday and I can cash out with a quick gain. IV is like 290% and I don't want to get IV crushed holding on too long
2021-05-29 19:17:22,stocks,"If mine was at 250% I'd cash haha. That 30%, I can afford to wait on that one."
2021-05-29 19:20:59,stocks,Been wondering the same thing. I bought a 14 put 6/25 a little too early on the way up. Down about 30% and thinking of just taking the loss. The only thing keeping it half alive at this point is the IV. If or when that slows I‚Äôm rekt.
2021-05-29 19:27:25,stocks,"I bought 6/25, $17 put, at $35. 

I would sell your 290% gain haha. That's nice."
2021-05-29 19:37:45,stocks,"One idea would be to convert your put to a put spread, by either selling a put above or below your strike. You can recoup some losses, although you should know the risks you may run into if you do this."
2021-05-29 19:59:15,stocks,This stock can lose 50% in a day or two so you may have a bit longer before selling

2021-05-29 18:09:45,stocks,Let your winners ride man. Unless you really are strapped for cash you‚Äôre better off holding if nothing has fundamentally changed about the company
2021-05-29 18:20:08,stocks,"I base my trims on the quality or my perceived quality of a stock. Longterm stability, profits and all other metrics you naturally use.

2021-05-29 17:54:36,stocks,I would try to get 100 shares so you can sell covered calls
2021-05-29 18:00:39,stocks,I personally would take profits and wait for a dip to get back in. Longterm capital gains trims are a solid strategy. Plus if you do FanLines on AAPL it‚Äôs broken and if it doesn‚Äôt get back above MA soon it‚Äôs next Fanline is $90. I personally am a longterm AAPL Bull but the shares I bought last year I‚Äôve been selling and keeping my under $50 Shares. I think it will get momentum going again but June is historically the second worst month and it‚Äôs been a hell of a run. Nobody got hurt taking profits.

2021-05-29 16:07:30,stocks,"Biotech has been popular due to Covid. I think there are a lot of companies with potential, especially because the space is quite large and there are a lot of small cap companies that are still to break out. I would not focus on the Covid manufacturers because I think they will stagnate for a while.

If you want to look for companies, I would look for companies that are developing drugs that are nearing the end of phase 2, phase 3 trials or those that are pending FDA approval.

What i have seen happen in this space is that a successful trial phase pops the stock and successful FDA pops the stock again. Usually then I sell and let the stock drop down and consolidate for 1-2 months and buy in again 1 quarter after FDA approval. This gives 1 quarter for the company to start the marketing and sales activities and you will see the stock pop again if it has been successful.

It takes a lot of time and effort doing DD on small/medium cap biotech if you do it seriously"
2021-05-29 19:31:39,stocks,"Biotech/Pharma requires a frustrating amount of DD and even then, it's practically a gamble since drug R&D fails more often than not.

Also, these are companies I would only invest in for a longer-term if you're looking for something undervalued with potential prospects. I wouldn't swing pharma/biotech unless they're an already established company."
2021-05-29 19:45:43,stocks,"I can't speak on 'swing trading' any specific stock, I did recently do a DD on BioNTech (BNTX) and through learning about them I got very BULLISH long term.  I don't post my DDs outside of one sub but it is linked in my profile.

When you think about it, it makes sense. In April 2020, the prices didn't rise at all due to the pandemic. Its somewhat normal they are increasing more now, to ""make up for 2020"". But i really doubt this carries on in 2022.

I think it‚Äôs wild that it hasn‚Äôt gone up after the brilliant quarter. I‚Äôll be adding soon."
2021-05-29 14:43:50,stocks,"Apple is no doubt a great company.  My concern with them is that the pandemic and stimulus may have pulled forward a lot of demand for their products, so sales may look very flat over the next year or so compared to the past last year."
2021-05-29 16:40:12,stocks,They‚Äôve been on the market for 41 years with an all time increase of 124.5k%. They sold 196M iPhones during the pandemic. I‚Äôm DCA for the long haul.
2021-05-29 16:52:31,stocks,"You cannot go wrong, they will produce their own chips, more efficient products, lower cost, bigger margin...

The problem with Apple is... They make too much cash! Actually, they have so much cash that they don't know what to do with it. They start new projects, increase dividends, increase the buy back shares program... However, they still have 200b of cash on hand. Investors critic the fact that this cash is not invested at, for example, 3% rate of return, so Apple is leaving 6b on the table.

If the problem is having too much cash, it means BUY, BUY, BUY."

2021-05-29 19:06:22,stocks,The stock is being held back by the epic games lawsuit. If Apple wins it will run. If the judge does something wild and orders the App Store restructured it could be a burden on the stock.
2021-05-29 15:42:04,stocks,"If 10 year interest rates stay below 2.5%, and inflation remains below 4%, I think apple could double again from here over 3 years. It‚Äôs a fantastic company returning 4.7% per year to shareholders(4% from buybacks), and growing at a measured pace. The customer is locked in to the luxury branding, locked down in the App Store, and there is nothing in the tech pipeline to outcompete the smartphone for the foreseeable future."
2021-05-29 16:07:39,stocks,"I add apple any chance I get. My belief is they are best company on the planet. I often find myself on my Iphone researching companies and eventually come back to, ‚ÄúIm just going to buy the company that makes the device I am using to research what companies to buy.‚Äù Dividend increases, massive buybacks, loyal customers(almost cult like), supply chains on lockdown, this company is an absolute beast."

2021-05-29 14:51:06,stocks,"I trimmed by position in Apple. I think its a good company with clear differentiated products and it will continue to grow, albeit slowly from now. it is overvalued when you look at key indicators under the assumption that sales trajectory will continue to be similar to higher. 

That being said, if Apple announces a new business (ie. apple car) then the shares will pop

I would agree with you OP that the stock will probably see \~140-150 at the end of the year and that already implies a 10% increase. However, if we see sales tank in q2/q3; actually i would say even if we see a small decrease in sales performance - then we might actually see it ending the year at \~130"
2021-05-29 14:53:44,stocks,"I think Apple will be a bit stagnant this summer but it will go up again when back-to-school shopping begins. Warren Buffett still holds a ton of Apple and seems to believe in the company, so I'm not too concerned"
2021-05-29 16:10:32,stocks,"I think Apple's position in the market not only as a tech giant but as a brand always makes them a good investment. I like what they're doing with their M1 Chip Series, their foray into AR and the Automotive business should boost share prices in the months to come.

I think it's a safe investment. Apple is not going anywhere, and I do think they have room to grow. It's a hold and forget about type of stock, and belongs in really any portfolio In my amateur opinion, as I don't think you can go wrong with it. I add a couple of shares every so often. My position isn't huge but it's decent enough.

200 Shares with average cost at $109.77."
2021-05-29 14:58:35,stocks,"Apple is a great company, it's just about fair value maybe a little high. The problem is it has grown so big high rates of returns are getting harder and there's potential for being targeted for anti trust issues. 

I'm willing to bet in 10 to 20 years people will have been glad they stuck with it. In the mid to short term there could be some pain. Look to pick it up on dips (or we could be in one now, you never know)."
2021-05-29 15:03:01,stocks,"I bought 8 LEAPS c $120 at the top of the year. At the time did not have the liquid to buy the stocks and was planning to exercise them in January 2022. I sold 4 of the contracts for a fair profit at end of January and since then I've added 2 more contracts, which are now down 10% yet still in the money.   
  
I'm a newb w options and still feel good about this play and very bullish on AAPL at large. I'm glad I don't have too much tied up in them and still have the opportunity to be in when/if it does go to $150."
2021-05-29 16:50:14,stocks,I don‚Äôt see anyone mentioning their legal fight over their App Store vs Epic. I only know surface level details but they rake in substantial profits from that store and it‚Äôs more likely than not they‚Äôll lose the case and have to pivot that business and lose profits. Maybe that‚Äôs what people are concerned about because their recent publicity on that case coincided with the recent dip.

2021-05-29 17:55:28,stocks,Most puzzling stock for me to understand in 2021. New products. Great sales. Billions in profits. Staple of phones worldwide. Cars coming in a year or two. Airtags selling like hot cakes and it trades sideways or down. Makes no sense

2021-05-29 17:49:03,stocks,"AAPL is a no-brainer imo. Physical iPhone sales still make up the biggest chunk of their gross revenue which is a brilliant opportunity to join everyone else in the FAANG by growing their services. 

Tim Cook is a great CEO. He's slow and calculated, but Apple is the top dog, so they have the luxury of being able to think before they act as there is no clear competition on the brink of overtaking them. I see services being a huge point of growth for them going forward."
2021-05-29 19:57:50,stocks,"I think Apple is my favorite company of all companies. Great products that I‚Äôm a huge fan of, crushed earnings recently and even just increased their dividend rate. I will always keep buying Apple"
2021-05-29 15:43:26,stocks,"Piggybacking off OP‚Äôs question: does the current valuation already price in a potential Apple Ad Network?

If you like the stock long  term I would not worry about it‚Äôs current year to date performance.

2021-05-29 17:57:38,stocks,"I hold some, but i think is extremely overvalued compared to the other 3 big tech companies, Microsoft, Google and Amazon. They are bigger and growing faster in pretty much everything. So why should i buy more Apple instead of the others when it has less potential and the others are cheaper?"
2021-05-29 17:59:32,stocks,I think the new m1x Mac pros will see a high demand.   Their new silicon has me excited.

2021-05-29 19:16:47,stocks,Stocks typically run fast and then have accumulation phases for long periods of time to let the valuation come down. Not buying more personally but I have a long term position and will let the dividends keep being reinvested.

It‚Äôs valued at $2.08 trillion. I think a lot of growth is already priced in, same with MSFT and AMZN. I wouldn‚Äôt expect much appreciation in share price for the next year or two but that‚Äôs my opinion."
2021-05-29 14:37:10,stocks,"AAPL has been trading sideways for a while now. Bought in at 130 as first ever investment! So that‚Äôs been raking in some dips...

But it‚Äôs AAPL. A 2T company that is innovative with most it not all the things they do. Considering they are looking to expand into new sectors there‚Äôs no reason why they can‚Äôt push 150,200,300,400 as a share price.

However, right now the price is probably about right, and possibly lower. May not buy anymore AAPL for now and continue to pay into VWRP (vt for Europe) and instead wait. Wouldn‚Äôt sell, that‚Äôs for sure with AAPL currently. 

Did you buy in at an ATH?"

> The firm thinks ""the key question is how things shape up for next year, as the current super-cycle has brought forward demand, the next iPhone line up is likely a '12S' type with limited innovation, and consumers spend less on consumer electronics as the economy reopens.""

> New Street estimates iPhone shipments in the 180M-200M range versus the 234M consensus.

> The firm says that the iPhone growth drivers ""can't be great"" with the first-hand installed base ""barely growing"" while replacement cycles are elongating. The record iPhone 12 cycle is ""consuming pent-up demand,"" which will reduce demand for the next model.

I'm not selling my shares but I agree with these guys in that we are in a bit of a danger zone and I would not be surpirised to see it fall a bit in the coming months."

It's trading at a low PE historically, but I think most of the timber pricing buy hype has trailed off, and if you look at the long, long term trend, it's already nearing or hit the upward higher-highs peak trend.

That being said, LPX has gone absolutely bonkers compared to its long-term trend, so maybe there's still room to run.

Solid State batteries are not new, and that idea has been around since the early 2000s, yet no progress...

There are numerous problems they have and i looked at some of their earnings and slides and its not impressive... I have experience working with batteries like recycling electric car batteries and i know the chemistry and mathematics behind charging them and stuff... Some main problems i have with QS is that their production batteries do not offer more charge cycles than conventional batteries, they mention how they can be charged very fast, yet other conventional chemistries like lifepo4 can also be supercharged and samsung and lg make thousands of tons of those batteries per year, they are also fairly affordable and profitable, and there is **no** evidence that even if QS achieved a commericial solid state battery, it would be commerically profitable. Furthermore, if tesla reaches or goes lower than100$/kwh which they are close to, that is so cheap, people wont be willing to pay like 300/kwh or 500/kwh or god knows what QS will be charging...

AMZN has been stagnant for the past few months, feel like I‚Äôm missing out on growth, should I sell AMZN or hold it? AMZN according to CFRA report is fair valued at 4,500$ approx, should I just hold and wait for the stock to jump? Have about 13 shares."

Channels occur after a large run up and are Bullish as you digest gains for the next leg higher. Double bottom at 2,900 and double top at 3,550 so I‚Äôve been selling Collars. If you have 100 shares then Sell Call options for premium if you don‚Äôt then just sell Calls near the top and Puts near the bottom. If your not into options then just hold it. June is historically a bad month for stocks so good chance we test the bottom but I would hold regardless."

It's P/E ratio still looks like an incredible value considering the growth of AWS and all the acquisitions it is making. 

AMZN is a strong hold for me and I am looking to buy more this month if the market dips during DC infrastructure bill negotiations.

You may miss out on other faster growth if you sell.  But it could break out in a month and perhaps leave you wishing for a $3500 share.  Chasing other gains may pay. Patience here with AMZN *will*, without a doubt, pay."

Each of Amazon‚Äôs businesses is blowing away most of the competition and the news/stats you hear about Amazon every day is just fascinating. And yet, the stock doesn‚Äôt move, yet.

1. what do you base your strategy on?
2. have these assumptions changed?
3. If they have, what did your strategy told you to do.
4. What is plan b.

With a defined strategy, you can rely on it.

I'll give you an example.

Let's say you study the staple product industry.

Assumption 1. Cocacola, nestle, pepsi are similar and should react to the business cycle in a similar fashion. Which mean that if 1 is down, all 3 should be down and vice versa.

Assumption 2. Run a linear regression on historical data to find the correlation on 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years + bonus linear regression on 2 different financial crash such as covid, 2008. Look at their coefficient of correlation. That mean if 1 rise in price, in theory (not in practice, but in theory), they other should follow to a ratio of one of your many coefficient of correlation. You can look at macro economic indicators to identify which coefficient makes the most sense.

Assumption 3. Your look at their Earning per shares and their dividend interest rate and you compare their mobile means on 3 days, 10 days, 90 days.

Then, when one of these 3 company goes further down than the other 2, you buy it. 

When that same company goes above the mobile mean 90 days, you sell and you buy the next lower one and you keep rotating.

&#x200B;

This is a strategy. It isn't the most efficient, you could add covered call to the mix or look at different indicator, but it's a strategy. 

This means that as long as your assumption hold, if there's day trading of the market and it goes down hard, it is part of your strategy. So you let the strategy take the decisions and you can sleep in peace.

If you are investing in random stock without a strategy with solid assumptions, you are gambling. 

That strategy could be based on fondamental of a company or it's ability to pay dividend and to make profits like in tabacco stock.

But you need a strategy.

I have multiple strategy which I follow to have a certain level of diversification even though I own less than 20 stock at a time. But each of those stock follow either a specific strategy or are based on fundamental and value play.

If my BTI stock goes down by 4 $, it just mean the dividend rate is now higher and my reinvestment rate is now higher. It doesn't affect me at all and since I have many other strategy, when one is in the red a little, I usually have the two third of my investment in the green. This year, I'm at 41% in the green.

If you don't know how to read fundamental or how to do linear regression, then learn how to or go boggle head investing into index fund.

Good luck."

2021-05-29 15:22:22,stocks,"I'm in a similar boat mentally with you, so I can empathize. But lets try to dissect some elements of your post so we can both learn from our mistakes:

>  I could or should be up about triple my whole account value but I dropped out of all of my trades multiple times due to fear 

What did you drop out of the trade? Were you taking on too much risk? What happens if the trade went the opposite way? Did you have conviction on the company?

You need to sit down and write out exactly why you did what you did so you can learn from the mistake. Create a manifesto booklet and avoid making the same mistakes over and over.

> I know what to do now but I also do not want to make any risky bets I want to be wise and patient but thinking about these losses has left me completely defeated day in and day out since January

Money isn't worth impact to your mental health or physical health. No amount of money made in the market can give you sanity, peace of mind or happiness. At best, stock market wins can buy you comforts. But I feel you're having the same issue as me which is chasing the high from winning in the stock market.

> do I get back on the horse and try to take risks on my way back? 

What is your risk tolerance? You should create a financial plan and a budget. How much money do you have in the market? How does your life change if that money goes to zero? If that money gives you the returns you expect, how does that change your life? Over what time horizon?

There's a reason that all good investors and hedge funds use risk analysis to figure out which trades you get into and which ones you get out of.

> every week I watch things that I think will happen come to pass and I stand there and do nothing out of fear and then I feel awful that I could have recouped my losses

This is me exactly. But why did you get out and sit on the sidelines? You literally cannot make money without expecting to lose money. This is where I struggle. I want a zero risk way to double my investment. Those things don't exist.

> I just feel like nothing is for certain and when I actually dip my toe and I will be wrong or the market will go a different way and I will freak out again

Yes, this is a risk that could happen and will most likely happen. Trading during times of high volatility can cause this behaviour. What you need to do is make a risk profile and figure out how much money you're willing to lose and the potential upside of your risk.


The biggest thing: If you're serious about depression due to the stock market, you should move to indexes and stop trading. Depression is serious business and can lead to very grave and irreversible medical issues. I would  highly recommend seeing a therapist before getting back into the market. Get your head straight, because emotional investing is guaranteed to lose you money."
2021-05-29 11:42:11,stocks,"Sounds like what you need is a globally diversified portfolio of index funds. Really takes the worry out of things. You just put money in and wait. No stock picking, no sector picking, no nation picking, means no worrying about doing the right thing. You can‚Äôt go wrong being long the world with a 30 year time horizon.

If you really don‚Äôt want to index, you need to figure out what your strategy is, and why you are confident in it. That will give you the confidence to stick to it trough the rough times. Everyone who picks their own stocks underperform from time to time. September last year I was down -14% YTD, against the S&P500 +10%, that was rough, but I knew what I was doing, and I was confident that my strategy was sound, and since then I‚Äôm up +50% against the S&P500‚Äôs +20%, which puts me about even with the benchmark once again. If you are trying to outperform there just isn‚Äôt a way out of occasional underperformance and loses. If you can‚Äôt stand being the bag holder while others get rich, investing ain‚Äôt for you, and the best thing to do is to automatically put money into an index (the world index) and stop following finance."

Stop trading with your emotions. That is what got you in this position. Take a few weeks/months off. Do some studying on fundamentals and technical analysis, and paper trade with what you learned for a minute.

None the less, that loss was clearly too much for you. Moving forward, I would ratchet back your risk a bit. If you‚Äôve been chasing meme stocks (which I gather from the yolo statement) or chasing last years tech returns, try investing in broader ETFs (diversified ones, the ones from vanguard, states street, ishares, not ARK since those can be much higher volatility). If you‚Äôve been investing in ETFs already (hard to imagine, the market is right near near highs, so you shouldn‚Äôt have lost much), it could mean you need to own cash or short duration bonds to smooth the ride. 

Everyone takes losses, the market isn‚Äôt a rocket ship, it‚Äôs a rollercoaster. We dust ourselves off, learn a little about our own risk tolerance, and move forward. Give your remaining investments enough time and it‚Äôs almost certain that that loss will be erased. Whether it takes 1 year, 5 years or 10 years is anyone‚Äôs guess.

Set yourselves principles and learn to control your emotions every time you have a urge to place a trade that goes against those principles (most important probably would be to never use safe ETF account to finance your gambling account, should the latter get blown up, which it will).

imo.  Invest in indexes.  Investing shouldn't be emotional.  Build up a sizeable portion in indexes.  Maybe in the future when you feel like you are ready you could invest in stocks.

Don't listen to the idiots that say you shouldn't sell if you're losing too much (anything over 12-15% for me depending on the stock). Eat the loss and make it back elsewhere. Make use of stop losses if you need to for that.

Also, don't put any more than 5-10% of your portfolio on one thing unless you have absolute conviction that you're going to be right.

People say have no more than 15 stocks, but that's still too much, I only hold about 5-7 at any given time with lots of cash on the side for new opportunities or for averaging down (over 50% of my portfolio).

As others have guessed, I presume you have been playing MEME stocks, probably GME and/or AMC. There are a few ways to win doing that, and sometimes win big even. But the most likely way is luck, not skill. Nobody can tell you how to be lucky. 

Those with awesome skills can play those stocks and pretty much guarantee a win because they win no matter which way the price swings. Some of their plays lose. But others more than make up for it. I don‚Äôt have that kind of skills... yet. Obviously you don‚Äôt either. Switch to something less tricky. Index funds have been suggested for example. Or even something boring. I have stock in beer for example. I think people are going to be drinking more this summer."

 Picked a lot of bad Ones too like CLNE $18 (3k down right now)  and didn‚Äôt let go as planned ( $1 increase in a few hours). I blame not following through my plan to let go with a modest but fast ( hours/ or minutes) increase in risky tickets."

If you have mastered step 1 THEN you take a portion of your money and learn how to trade Technicals and you can get pretty good at predicting when the market or stocks will pullback because they always do. That being said even with TA you still have to pair it with Fundamentals and you don‚Äôt YOLO your money in all at once.

I've dumped most of my stuff in VTI and a few others and it's been nice seeing -1% or so at worst compared to a lot of my old investments jumping everywhere.  You can still have a small amount of play money, but you will find when you have most of your investment in a stable account, that your side, less stable investments are more easy to keep the course since you aren't losing a ton of money on a bad day.

What I've learned in the last year is it really is best to just drop in some stable stuff, and play around with only a small amount.  Heck, if I had just dropped everything in VTI in the beginning of 2020 before the covid drop, I would be up 33%.  This a total stock market index fund, so it's less liable to just crash hard less the entire market goes, and since it is spread out, it should always recover."

The fed has been explicit about keeping the economy going at all costs, but even they must have a limit somewhere.

2021-05-29 17:56:44,stocks,"Trading is 99% risk management and 1% making the right calls. If you're making the right calls, well that's great but you need to work on the other 99%.  

Try to develop a solid strategy, explore the grand topic of risk management and don't trade leveraged derivatives and/or options if you don't know what you're doing. It's better to test your strategy and develop your risk management on less volatile assets like the underlying stocks, if you set up realistic targets as well as stop-loss orders you minimize the downside.

And don't try to yolo it back. You learned a lesson, now go back and do things properly.

I work with monthly goals myself, but if you wanna set up a daily goal for your trading you can think as follows: If you manage to make 0.5% a day on your starting amount you'll be making 125% on the start amount in a year (\~250 trading days) and that's pretty fucking good. This doesn't mean you have to go ALL-IN every day to reach your target for the day or the week or whatever. If you make 3% on 1/6 of the amount the goal is reached. This also comes down to risk management. 

And some final advice: Not making a trade is also a trade."

If you are comfortable and confident about how to trade in the company or companies you will be investing in then that fear starts to melt away very fast. If you cannot handle the stress or anxiety when your trade goes sideways you should consider not trading. Because if you learn how to trade the first things you will learn is how to mitigate a bad trade through various techniques. IMO Hire a certified financial assistant that will invest your money for you. Or do what everyone else is saying and just put all your extra money in an index fund.

I've only started trading since December 2020. I've been very lucky with my trades. I've also been reading everything I can, to help me be confidently cautious in my trades.

You should just keep to things like S&P 500 Index Funds or target retirement mutual funds. It's not sexy, but if you had put all of that money you lost into an index fund back then you'd still be at +8% or more.

EDIT: Also in general it seems like you're actually just investing in individual stocks.

2021-05-29 18:41:48,stocks,"Let me just say that what you are feeling is absolutely normal, and it‚Äôs part of the game Wall Street is playing.

Every time you make a ‚Äúbet‚Äù, there‚Äôs someone else on the opposite side of the bet that‚Äôs trying to take your money.

So what do they do?

They use the price, media, and any news to trick you into losing money. They are literally playing psychological warfare to convince you, you made a bad bet, and you should take your loses.

How do you overcome this?

You need to read DD, and make an educated guess on what‚Äôs going to happen. Afterwards you need to have conviction and stick to your guns.

Remember this is a psychological game, and the more you get in your head, the more the other side wins.

Trust yourself, trust your research, and trust your investment.

After that, you‚Äôre on your way to becoming a value investor."

Swing trading and scalping are tough business, so don‚Äôt do it unless you are prepared to lose money for a while.  

Find something with less risk like a mutual fund or index fund.  

Make smaller trades!  $200-$300 at a time (of you can afford it).  Don‚Äôt go all in on a trade especially if you haven‚Äôt done your research on it first.  Get familiar with a stock like that before going in deeper.  

Study stock charts and trade channels for a while.  Many stocks will trade within a range for weeks and weeks, allowing you to get more familiar with their tendencies.  If you absolutely must swing trade or scalp then this might help.

Hers i would place trades and that was that, mine i would sell sometimes and the stock move higher after.  Point is I would feel as I missed profit on mine and hers was ""well she made money!
    Try paper trades it will help define your strategy.  Look for value not hype.  Don't chase gains.  When a stock is suffering watch for the bounce.  Watch for earnings but dont chart it to death days prior."
2021-05-29 19:22:12,stocks,"The first thing I would recommend when you find a new trade is to walk away for some time and then come back and reassess if you really want to get in. You can‚Äôt time the market so an hour or day honestly won‚Äôt be a deal breaker. And once you‚Äôve committed to a trade, before you jump in build an exit strategy.

Decide how long you want to stay in the trade, how much you want in profit and how much you‚Äôre ok with losing. ‚ÄúI already decided I‚Äôm ok with losing everything‚Äù is not a valid exit strategy. Trust me. However you should know that whatever money you put into the market is no longer your money. It‚Äôs the markets. So whatever you put in you should not rely on it being there. Do not risk your rent money because you‚Äôre going to end up homeless. On the other side gains are gains. If you exit with more money than you went in with you are up. And at the end of the day the realistic profits don‚Äôt come from jackpots, they‚Äôre from compounding your gains. If you set a 20% loss threshold and a 5% gain threshold stick to it. Don‚Äôt get greedy and don‚Äôt ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù. And when you decide on how long you want to stay in a trade if you decide on 1 month then at the end of the month you get out no matter what. Stick to your plan.

Options are attractive because they provide leverage but if you don‚Äôt know anything about the greeks you‚Äôre going to get screwed over. The only advice I will give you on that topic is to not trade options until you fully understand why it‚Äôs possible to buy an OTM option that goes ITM and still end up losing money overall on that trade as well as why it‚Äôs possible to buy an OTM option that will likely never go ITM and still make money on it.

Trading isn‚Äôt about yoloing, diamond hands or staying in a trade past reason, it‚Äôs about doing the due diligence and sticking to your plan. Day trading isn‚Äôt for the weak willed. The worst thing you can do is trade on emotion. The market preys on FUD and that is why it is so important to do your research, create a plan beforehand and stick to the plan. If you can‚Äôt do that then switch to ETF‚Äôs, dividend stocks and bonds because this game is definitely not for you. 14000 is a lot to lose but in all honestly you can make that back if you go about it the right way. Probably not in a month or even a year or two but it‚Äôs possible. And even if you don‚Äôt make it back for years or ever it isn‚Äôt the end of the world. Life goes on, money comes and goes and at the end of it all it‚Äôs a lesson that will hopefully be useful in the future."

Another question would be, what would you have done if you made 30000? Would you be making riskier bets? What would you do if you made 30000 and lost it all? You should be working on your risk tolerance and mental health before throwing a Yolo bet and regretting it when we're in one of the most volatile markets in history.

The market, however, will almost always recover.

It would by no means be unheard of to face a 30-50% drawdown in the market at some point.  Given how valuations look right now and with tapering fears, I think it's a horrible time to lump sum into VTI.

I would recommend individual, undervalued and reliable picks right now, or if you must, dollar cost average into VTI instead of putting it all in at once."

2021-05-29 15:25:39,stocks,"At OP - and when you do come back, ask yourself what your long term goals are. What areas of the market are you passionate about, if any? Do you enjoy the process of learning or would you be better suited to fully index and invest your time and energy elsewhere? Maybe a hybrid of the two? Google portfolio visualizer for help. 

What I do is index 60% and the rest goes into individual stocks, largest of which is Tesla 20-25%. I've had high conviction with this company since 2018. I trim my gains and keep it within that 20-25% range. The 2020 crash and the recent rotation out of growth hurt, but it didn't impair me permanently. Other than rebalancing I did absolutely nothing during both corrections. 

I don't believe I would be able to stay the course if I were only in it because of reddit or social media. You have to find what works for you and don't be afraid of making mistakes as long as you're willing to grow and learn from them. I really like the idea of leaving the table for at least a week and then come back and reevaluate. As with a rough draft paper it's easier to re-evaluate at a later time."

Additionally, the bank advisor usually force you to freeze your money for 5+ years. I believe this is sub optimal... with my self directed VTI investment i can afford to be more aggressive in how much i keep in my saving accounts, and if a bad luck happened its not hard to cash out from VTI.

Obviously I'm not a value investor but the philosophy is similar in that I buy and hold what I believe is a solid company and I don't worry what the man will pay for my farm. 

I'm using VTSAX/VTI or similar total domestic market for roughly 85% of my index funds and 15% is international. Of the total domestic market funds Tesla represents 1.26% (as of April) and likely less now that it's dropped a bit. Either way I'm around 1% exposure to TSLA through my index funds.

So technically, as an American, when you're buying stock in many Chinese companies (or in index funds that hold Chinese companies in sensitive industries) you're buying ""American Depository Receipts"" (ADR). ADRs give you the rights to your share of the company's profits. May seem like an arbitrary distinction, but it makes the accounting even more complicated when the company is listed on an American stock exchange and has to follow SEC guidance (including a PCAOB audit)"

2021-05-29 13:51:45,stocks,"It is hard to separate financial concerns from political posturing when it comes to Chinese stocks.  The Trump administration pushed to get Chinese companies de-listed and Biden seems to be continuing that process.  The US politicians want to ""look tough against China"".  However, what they are really doing is making it hard for Americans to invest in the growth opportunities of Tencent, Alibaba, Huawei, and other great companies.  

The argument about Chinese companies lying about their accounting is equally political.  China and America each have their own accounting rules.  No one is lying, they just use different accounting processes, so investors need to understand both.  You are correct in pointing out that real fraud is a problem everywhere.  There have been companies that blew up due to fraud all over the world.  Bernie Madoff is a famous America stock fraudster, but China has a few of their own too."

Traditional brokerages are closed after hours/weekends but CB is always open.  And its more exciting due to the big moves in crypto.

&#x200B;

I am on this platform more than any other and so are my friends.   Most of us forgot about our stocks and never day trade, just hold but the new economy CB has built and the slickest UI in the space made me realize.

&#x200B;

This is a buy and hold forever stock.  No wonder why JPM/GS/WFC are scrambling to get in.  its literally the biggest cash cow machine we have seen in decades.   

&#x200B;

Plus they custody 11% of all crypto assets and BInance CEO even said CB is VERY undervalued at 100 billion.  For a competitor to say that is quite rare."

Doesn't seem like a choice that is going to help you diversify at all. 

Additionally, since they did a direct offering insiders are selling their shares directly on the secondary market which seems to have put more downward pressure on the price than a traditional IPO just due to the volume of selling.

There are more and more popular companies either adding this functionality (SoFi, Paypal, Robinhood, Square) or mimicking it entirely (Gemini, BlockFi, Kraken) not to mention all of the foreign equivalents (Binance, etc.) and just wait until the legacy brokers start offering crypto services which will not only take away market share but also force them to lower their high fees to match competition.

2021-05-29 00:00:00,stocks,"I think Xiaomi has huge long term potential in IoT - tech giant at a market cap of just $85 billion Xiaomi (HK: 1810) is a mere 11 years old and didn't go public until 2018 - the same year they turned profitable, yet the are a well known brand and already third in global smartphone sales.

A few days ago the company delivered a pretty wicked [earnings report](https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/05/26/xiaomi-posts-record-results-as-2021-q1-revenue-and-profit-hit-historical-high-levels/) with an adjusted net profit increase of 163%. 

 [Two days prior I published an article](https://jesbaek.com/2021/05/23/xiaomis-future/) of how their unique 'AIoT' and 'Internet Services' strategy will eventually allow the company to make much larger profits on revenue in the future.

Xiaomi commands one of the largest product portfolios with smart enabled devices of every category. In the West we don't yet see their smartphones too often - but their robo vacuum cleaners and electric scooters (They own Ninebot and Segway) and other smart home equipment is everywhere. They are basically taking the opposite route of Google and Apple in providing the hardware before the software - which also means they currently have higher costs and lower return on revenue.

Yet they are already profitable and sit on a cash pile of 5.6 billion. About 60% of their revenue right now is however attributed to their smartphones - which are doing extremely well. Their phones receive high praise (though their Android fork is not liked by all) and offer unbeatable performance for the price. They do well in every price category and own several well known sub brands like Redmi, Poco and Blackshark. As an example Mrwhosetheboss (huge tech YT channel) picked Xiaomi brands for all top 3 spots for his best phones of 2021 out of 22.

Xiaomi holds the top spot in market share in several emerging markets: India, Russia and most of Eastern Europe and soon South America. In Scandinavia where I live, they just recently entered local carrier stores, began advertising actively and opened a local [official webshop](http://www.mistore.dk). The ban on Huawei left a HUGE gap in the European market for Xiaomi to just freely gobble up and it seems like they are doing it. Xiaomi themselves have been [removed](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-us-remove-blacklist-1224721/) from a similar (but much less severe) blacklist by the US government this week as well. They do not pose the same threat as Huawei did, as they do not build infrastructure telecom equipment

There are rumors of the company designing their own SoCs (chips) in collaboration with OPPO and just last month they [invested $10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/chinas-xiaomi-to-launch-electric-car-business-and-invest-10-billion.html) into the Electric vehicle space. They already financially back Xpeng too and I think with the insane growth in the Chinese EV market they really have an opportunity to add even more value to their ecosystem integration.

The company is founded by Lei Jun and former Vice President of Google China and Zhou Gaungping then Senior Director at Motorola‚Äôs Beijing R&D Center. All three still lead the company today with Lei Jun as CEO. Xiaomi and their CEO has a huge following in China and a very dedicated loyal fan base. 

The company trades at a P/E of 23 and a share price of 28.6 HKD (~3.69 USD). The price to earnings is pretty typical for a tech stock but I think the benefits in profit of Xiaomi's strategy and investments are yet to be seen. I began buying up a few months ago and just doubled my investment after the earnings report. I will continue to buy in over atleast the next year and truly think this is a case of a company working hard for the future and with the right strategy. I saw the same patterns in Microsoft 6 years ago when Sadya Nedella took over and that position I'm up over 500%.

Please let me know what you think and if you feel like there is anything you feel like I need to address. I'm really bullish on this company and it helps balance my portfolio with exposure towards Asia. I know Chinese stocks can be effy and at least for me it was also quite the challenge to find a brokage where I could buy them."

Just got a new Mi 11 after I broke the screen on my Mix 3, and my Mrs is still using a RedMi Note 5 I got her about 4 years ago, plus my old Note 3 I gave her when I bought the Mix 3.

2021-05-29 00:00:00,stocks,"2K to invest stocks or ETF Hi,

Additional 2k to invest in portfolio - currently own the following 

VWRP and SMT

AAPL 10 @ 130 (could DCA)
MSFT
TGT
V
ALLY
DIS
F
PEP
AMD
IAG

Looking to shift away from a few of those stocks so really between putting the extra into VWRP or splitting it with one of those stocks, possibly increase position in V?

Reasoning behind wanting to increase V is for the most part their push into crypto payments such as PYPL and everyone uses Visa/MasterCard. If money becomes something split between crypto Visa can bank on utilising their own adaptation on that. The company is a slow burner but a solid blue chip and with AAPL trading sideways the only other one perhaps is MSFT. 

Regardless it is all quite tech heavy, so perhaps VWRP is the one to invest the funds to. Leaning toward all to VWRP but wanted to see if someone suggested anything other?"

MSFT
TGT
V

VWRP

but unsure really if it‚Äôs worth doing so for

ALLY
AMD
PEP

Don‚Äôt need the money right now, so like it doesn‚Äôt bother to hold onto these stocks for a while as I do expect them to increase in value. 

But is the right way to do these stocks to sell out the ones that aren‚Äôt going to bring in much of any value for years, sell at a loss, then invest that money into increasing positions into the more established stocks when plausible such as MSFT and V or just combine it with the 2k and whack it in VWRP."

So basically, it's a gamble.

If you think the status quo will remain, you'll probably make a ton of money investing in them if you turn out to be right. Like, a lot. As much as someone investing in Amazon in 2008 would.

2021-05-29 10:02:57,stocks,"Of the top publicly-traded global brands, BABA is the best value when measured against it's 52-wk low.  Just BABA and VZ are within 10% of their 52-wk lows.

I view this as a possible buy signal, perhaps with dollar cost averaging, if you're looking for a bargain."
2021-05-29 08:54:09,stocks,"Online retail market is growing worldwide. In China it has even more potential than the US with so many people rising from poverty and such a huge population. However, the main drawback is that the Chinese market is run by the CCP, not anything near free trade. This can be a boon if they back it, but could tank them if they don't. Arguably, the company is worth more as a company than as the rubble they could reduce it too, but then again the CCP has shown multiple times that political posturing is worth more to them than profits."

Baba is experiencing what FAANG is since years and they only went up.

It‚Äôs simply China starting to establish a correct Framework for competition"
2021-05-29 14:33:24,stocks,"alibaba ran a **large** underground market of peptides and AAS and such. All listings of this were banned about 2-3 months ago and sources have started dropping like flies ever since. If you don't believe me, check the r/Peptides or r/steroids subreddit. I was effected by this firsthand on the consumer side. All sources have since moved to whatsapp for further communication as its now banned on the Alibaba platform. I cant actually begin to guess how much of Alibaba's market this represented, but I would assume it was large (at least 10%). Ngl, this will put a big damper on Alibaba sales. Something to consider, as now these places are going to be looking elsewhere to make sales for hundreds of dollars of orders at a time from singular buyers looking to either resell the items themselves, or for personal use. Its very well known that a lot of the peptides and AAS here in the US are manufactured in China"
2021-05-29 08:52:17,stocks,"Search for BABA on this sub. There has been a thread every week for the past few months why it is so cheap at the current price. There are stocks that can double in the next couple years. Maybe BABA is one of them. But you can find others with a better risk, reward ratio."
2021-05-29 09:52:25,stocks,"Everyone here on reddit seems to say china scam this and xi that. The truth is that we are dumb money and dumb money is dumb. When the price is low, there must be something wrong with the stock, according to most people. My take is that China is undergoing their own bond crisis with Huarong and they tightened fiscal policy earlier than us. We all know what a bond selloff and even the notion of tightening policy did to our market. The fine was bad but now that big money is going in, the coast is mostly clear (keep in mind that they won‚Äôt necessarily time the bottom either though). Once the stock goes up, people will shut up about delisting and scams. 

If you had bought a ton of LEAPs and shares during the covid bear market, you would be rich. China is going through a bear market too. Think about that."

BuT dElISTiNg Is CoMiNg. I buy my shares directly in at the hong Kong stock exchange.
So i dont care about a delisting in the usa. I bought baida,baba, tencent and jd.com. All These companies produce their revenue in China, so why should i be scared of a delistibg in the USA"

2021-05-29 12:52:48,stocks,"Too risky politically for me, with threat of delistings of Chinese stocks on US markets, shady accounting and fraud in China, Xinnie the pooh clamping down on them.

2021-05-29 15:50:04,stocks,"What is happening with BABA has nothing to do with the business prospects of BABA.  Any company/founder that gets into the government's crosshairs is living on borrowed time in China.   They will be ok for some time till the government sorts our things, but the competitors will start getting more favors and the licenses for the company will be slowly reduced or outright denied.   What happened with Ant financial should be a warning to anyone who wants to look at BABA as a longer-term investment."

2021-05-29 08:18:16,stocks,"Every week, this question gets asked here. I still stand by the thought, that it just makes no sense to invest in a company with severe risks even though fundamentals \*might\* be good (no proof, Chinese company) when there are SO many other good choices with less risk and similar reward possibilities (AMD, Micron, Oil etc.)"

2021-05-29 11:38:06,stocks,"I think it looks quote undervalued. Less than a year ago it traded for 42 p/e, and now trades around 24. So there‚Äôs nearly 2x upside just on sentiment switching, not to mention actual growth (which has been, and is projected to be, nothing short of great). I know nothing of chinese politics, but I can‚Äôt imagine the CCP is in the business of killing golden geese. Bought some the other day."

2021-05-29 11:52:45,stocks,"If it was a company in a liberal constitutional democracy with strong rule of law, etc, absolutely I'd buy. The regulatory risk attached to it because it's based in China, and that what you're investing in with BABA stock is actually a Variable Interest Entity mean I wouldn't consider investing in it regardless of price really."
2021-05-29 12:18:26,stocks,"What you really need to ask is ""do I understand chinese markets and politics?""  Because if you do, then go ahead and buy Baba.  I personally don't.  I learned this lesson the hard way with Tencent a few years ago.  

One of the biggest pitfalls for us reddit investors is approaching the market like shopping.  ""Oh, great deal here, it's on sale!""  Doesn't work that way.  Buying low and selling high is great, but I'm not buying unless I feel like I have a good handle on the major issues around it anymore.

That means I'm not buying Baba or any chinese stocks until I successfully seduce a hot chinese insider"
2021-05-29 12:19:06,stocks,Charlie Munger and Monish Pabrai both got in recently. So I‚Äôm assuming the intrinsic value is probably around 300

I think Xi and the CCP will probably leave Ma alone for a while considering he's apologised and is staying low. Should allow BABA room to continue organic growth for the next couple years unless Ma pisses off the CCP again."

2021-05-29 12:42:23,stocks,I wouldnt touch chinese stocks. Too risky based on their politics. The ceo got disappeared.  They can always just destroy baba and give all its assets to a new company.
2021-05-29 12:46:24,stocks,"the value of this stock has nothing to do with the company itself and everything to do with the Chinese government and their satisfaction with the company leadership.

BABA could be the world's largest most successful, most honest and most stable company. But if Xi decides tomorrow that they're a threat to his power you'll be getting financial reports sent from a prison mail office on Monday."
2021-05-29 12:52:09,stocks,"What about PDD, they have more users than Baba now"
2021-05-29 12:59:14,stocks,"Maybe the answer lies in why and how amzn went from an EPS of say $-0.40 per share to $52.  Baba is about EPS $8.50. The bulk of revenue is still retail for both if I‚Äôm not mistaken. AWS started turning a profit in 2015. Ali Cloud now. I‚Äôd expect similar outcomes. The time is maybe ripe, but I‚Äôve never been very good at these things. PS AWS is Amzn‚Äôs cash cow. Say moooooüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"

2021-05-29 14:10:42,stocks,I grabbed 75 shares at 212. Should be some easy gains in the back half of the year I would think.
2021-05-29 14:25:31,stocks,Been looking at BABA since 270s. It never goes up. Wait for confirmation to buy.
2021-05-29 14:26:25,stocks,I just don't trust Chinese stocks. There are just way too many unknowns.

2021-05-29 15:15:50,stocks,they are facing more competition in the cloud business from huawei and losing government contracts to them. Also it's unclear what's gonna happen with ant group. So imo the current valuation is justified.
2021-05-29 15:44:14,stocks,I dig BABA and I think it‚Äôll bounce back once it gets thru the politics hoops it has to jump through.

The CCP is clamping down on monopolies, but they are not being very harsh about it, really. Alinaba‚Äôs fine was not large. Politically, I think the CCP wants their companies to succeed/crush/dominate and become global brands, global behemoths. BABA is part of that spear point. Xi‚Äôs CCP is not going to stop that from happening. But they also want to make sure it happens on their terms. The CCP itself a monopoly, and love em or hate them you can‚Äôt deny they‚Äôve been successful under Xi in many ways. They want their SOEs and giants to have the same level of success. Anyone who thinks they are holding back companies like Alibaba is extremely shortsighted."

2021-05-29 09:28:31,stocks,"People are so hyped just because they see Amazon P/E and believe that BABA is a steal that can go to similar values. Which obviously is ridiculous, considering that Chinese companies are lower in value for a reason - political risks, heck, we don't even know if their books are cooked or not cause nobody is allowed to check them from Western countries.

As long as there is a dictator in China, P/Es of their companies will always be way lower especially if listed through shell companies."

2021-05-29 14:29:42,stocks,There is no delisting risk. That is just short fodder. Goldman recently put a buy recommendation on BABA and Al Gore's investment firm bought last quarter. Politically connected entities like those two would not have bought the NYSE shares if that were the case.

2021-05-29 11:05:43,stocks,Well in the end Samsung is the winner. Dont worry China will be producing Chips. Baba made their own Risc-v chip which is better than the arm structure for their cloud buisness. Next year semiconductor manufacture will have 5nm Chips.
2021-05-29 18:03:59,stocks,"Okay. Firstly, if big money is to buy into any market, there has to be a lot of supply of the security so that they can get a reasonable piece of the pie. You'd be happy with 100 shares, they'd most likely be happy holding 10 million shares. This means their profit is increased should the security (stock) perform well over time.




Building off from the example I shared above of say Black Rock buying into BABA and they have $2billion to put in. 

Scaling in would mean they place what is called ""icebag orders"" at different price levels probably close but not too obviously close to each other. If the aim is to accumulate 10 million shares, the icebag orders will usually be at $245/share - maybe 200k shares. Followed by $240/share for another 200k shares. Since this is a decently sized position, the share price will move in waves, dropping lower and lower.



The drop in price means there's a lot of uninformed investors selling (abandoning their positions) because maybe they're losing faith in the company or fear and hopelessness, in the process supplying those shares right into the hands of big money - meaning they accumulate even more shares as price drops. 


The reason for their orders to be iceberg (_an iceberg order means that it's an order that's been broken up into smaller bite sizes so that each order fill contributes into the big money investor's overall position of $2billion_) is so that as they get filled, they don't offset price and cause an unnecessary bump or rally in price and ruining their risk to reward ratio. Think of it as the tip of the iceberg


Once big money has accumulated their $2bil position at maybe ~$220 DCA, the stock now will be in ""strong hands"" - investors who are fully committed and unwilling to sell their positions resulting to price eventually reacting positively to good news or price target valuations by ""renowned"" stock analysts in Wall Street."

And given the size of the country and its economy, and given that the US and it's allies and Russia have made it clear they oppose China, this is commensurate with their need to protect themselves.

If you want to have some idea of where China spends it's public finds, take a look at their highway system, which is 55% larger than the US's, or their high-speed rail network which is 69,548% larger than the US's.  Or look at their university system.  They have added more than 380 universities in the last decade, an increase of nearly 17%.  In the last decade, they have added 14,000 hospitals, an increase of 70%.

This is before you look at how quickly they are expanding housing and everything else their population needs.  China has the future by the balls because they invest in the future like no other country on earth.  The strength of their government to make decisions and execute them is unparalleled in the western world.  For one, their ability to use eminent domain to build infrastructure is huge.  If they want to build out their new 1000 kmph maglev in Shanxi, it's gonna get built.  Meanwhile in Minneapolis, my hometown, we've been trying to build out our light rail system for more than a decade and most communities (especially affluent ones) NIMBY it into oblivion."

I also speak the language, so that helps a lot. 

Xi is a dictator, but the Chinese people aren't stupid. There is a social contract here, and the Chinese people support him as long as that social contract is not broken. 

Furthermore, Xi is not only concerned about holding on to power. He wants to cement his legacy and is playing a civilizational game. Part of this civilizational game is to propel China as a, if not THE, dominant power in the world. There are many facets to this game, from being a financial juggernaut and attract investors to have skin in his game, to building soft power through other means.

His existing political position, support from his party and the people, and his civilizational goal are very intimately intertwined. If one unravels, the others will very quickly unwind too. That's why BABA received a large fine that would hurt and get the point across, but not lead to irreversible damage. The ""risks"" some of you here point towards still exist (because they remain strategic options in the geopolitical fight between US and China), but they are much less probable than what some make out to be.

You are in a thread about BABA, so stating you cannot trust auditing firms serves to ignite fears that BABA's financials maybe fraudulent. No, the probability is much higher they are in good standing based on being an NYSE listed company who is being audited by a big established firm.

2021-05-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 31st, 2021 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 31st, 2021.

# **A big jobs report looms in the week ahead, as markets enter the often-weak month of June - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/jobs-report-looms-in-the-week-ahead-as-markets-enter-the-often-weak-month-of-june.html)**
*****
> May‚Äôs employment report is the big event in the week ahead, as stocks enter the often weak month of June. Stocks are finishing May with a mixed performance. Big cap indexes like the S&P 500 and Dow notched gains. The S&P rose a half percent, and the Dow rose 1.9%. The small cap Russell 2000 was flat, up 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 1.5%.
*****
> June is not historically a strong month for stocks. Bespoke Investment Group points out that over the past 50 years, the Dow has gained just 0.12% in June and has been positive 52% of the time.
*****
> But over the past 20 years, June was far weaker, gaining only 40% of the time. June‚Äôs performance is tied with September as the worst month of the year, with an average Dow decline of 0.7%, according to Bespoke.
*****
> The economy is front and center in the coming week with the important ISM readings on manufacturing and services sector activity, but the most important measure will be Friday‚Äôs jobs report. According to Dow Jones, economists expect Friday‚Äôs employment report to show the creation of about 674,000 jobs in May, after the disappointing 266,000 jobs added in April. That was about a quarter of what economists had expected.
*****
> ‚ÄúYou know if we have two months in a row of not delivering on the jobs expectations, the market is going to get nervous,‚Äù said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG. ‚ÄúHopefully, we beat it and then that creates a positive buzz, and we go into the Fed meeting and then we‚Äôre, ‚ÄòHey, the economy is still on track.‚Äô‚Äù
*****
> # Big June event
> The Fed meets June 15-16, and already market pros are anticipating it will be the most important event of the month. Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep policy easy as they watch to see signs that the economy is really healing. They also contend that higher inflation readings are temporary, since the data is being compared with a weak period last year.
*****
> Key for the markets is whether the Fed begins to believe that inflation is higher than it expected or that the economy is strengthening enough to progress without so much monetary support. Fed officials have said they would consider discussing tapering back on their quantitative easing bond purchase program if they see signs of improvement, and that would be a first step toward interest rate hikes, not expected until at least 2023.
*****
> If inflation runs too hot, the Fed‚Äôs main weapon to combat it is to raise interest rates.
*****
> The prospect of higher interest rates makes the stock market nervous, since it would mean higher costs for companies and less liquidity. In theory, higher interest rates also means that investors could potentially choose higher-yielding bond investments over stocks.
*****
> The next big read for the economy is Friday‚Äôs jobs report, and it looms large as recent inflation readings have come in much hotter than expected. The latest was the personal consumption expenditures price index Friday. It showed core inflation running at 3.1% year over year, the strongest reading for that measure since 1992.
*****
> The Fed‚Äôs beige book on the economy is expected Wednesday. ISM manufacturing data is expected Tuesday, and ISM services is released Thursday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on central banks and climate change at Green Swan 2021 global virtual conference Friday.
*****
> # Inflation flare-up
> The Fed has said it would tolerate an average range of inflation around its 2% target until it sees inflation sticking at a higher level. Inflation has been running mostly below 2%, prior to the latest numbers.
*****
> ‚ÄúWith the PCE number coming in like every other inflation number over the last six weeks, hotter than expected, the market is inching closer to calling the Fed out on its view that inflation is transitory,‚Äù said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG.
*****
> Emanuel said the speculative activity around meme stocks this week is a sign of froth and shows a large amount of liquidity in the hands of investors. One of those stocks, AMC, closed off 1.5% on Friday after rallying 116% in the past week, giving it a 2021 gain of 1,200%.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe net net on the index level is basically it‚Äôs a stock market that‚Äôs moving sideways,‚Äù Emanuel said. ‚ÄúOur view continues to be that when you look at it longer term, the big picture is this is a bull market that started in March of last year that has further to run. When you look at it in the medium term, the market has every right to be concerned and we do believe they will amp up their concern that the Fed‚Äôs paying insufficient attention to price stability.‚Äù
*****
> Emanuel said he studied what happened to stocks when core PCE was above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target. ‚ÄúThe average monthly return for months where the core PCE has been over 2%, going back to 1989 is (a decline) of 1.6%, with a decided bias toward more defensive sectors like health care outperforming and a very pronounced bias for technology of all kinds to underperform,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Technology stocks, as measured by the S&P information technology sector, gained 1.6% in the past month, and are up 5.9% year to date. The sector is lagging the S&P 500‚Ä≤s 12% gain.
*****
> The top-performing sectors have been cyclical year to date, with energy up 36.2%, financials up 28.5%, materials up 20.1% and industrials up 18.3%. Communications services, which contains some internet growth names, gained 16% since the start of the year. Health care has been outperforming information technology, up 8.6% year to date.
*****
> In the past week, the S&P 500 gained 1.2% to 4,204 and is within 1% of its all-time high. The Dow rose 0.9% to 34,529, and the Nasdaq was up 2% at 13,748.
*****
> # Red flag?
On the edges of the financial markets, market pros are paying attention to signs of a huge surge of liquidity in the financial system. In the past week, institutions have been placing unprecedented amounts of cash with the Fed, nearly a half trillion dollars Thursday.
*****
> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs way too much liquidity in the system, and it‚Äôs happening as a result of the Fed‚Äôs ongoing QE, but also disbursements from the fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said Goncalves.
*****
> He said the funds from trillions in stimulus, including to state and local governments, have not yet been spent but have found their way into the banking system. At the same time, institutions and individuals continue to move funds into money market funds, now holding about $4.6 trillion.
*****
> Those funds also put pressure on the system, since they put funds in Treasury bills. Goncalves expects the Fed to raise rates on excess reserves if the situation gets worse.
*****
> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no precedent for this because it is totally a function of there being just too much money in the system,‚Äù he said.
*****
> ‚ÄúInstitutions are redepositing cash at the Fed because they don‚Äôt have enough bills or short-term commercial paper. There‚Äôs not enough fixed income assets to go around,‚Äù said Goncalves. He said banks also do not want to hold the excess cash since it counts against their leverage ratio, and they would prefer to find other higher-yielding investments.
*****
> What it has done is sparked some speculation that the Fed would taper its QE program sooner than expected, he said.

> # Days After Memorial Day Improving

> Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 31, 2021. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> For decades the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market‚Äôs performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive.

> Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, but S&P 500 declined five straight days after 2015-2019. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Eight Months‚Äù which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to ‚Äì1.1% while S&P 500‚Ä≤s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%.

> # Checking the Gauges: Economic Surprise Indexes

> In terms of whether economic data is either beating or missing economists‚Äô forecasts, it appears conditions may now be a bit better overseas. Driven by some improving COVID-19 trends, the economic backdrop has improved overseas, while high economic expectations have proved to be a more formidable hurdle here in the U.S. This improvement has helped to steady the foundation in many non-U.S. equity markets, and has caused us to improve our outlook for developed non-U.S. stocks. We believe the improving COVID-19 trends in Europe could be particularly sticky as vaccine distribution becomes more widespread.

> For several years now, being underweight European equities, relative to the U.S., has been a winning trade. A sea-change in that thinking could be approaching as value-heavy European indices have gotten some attention with the improvement from value, but a firm, constructive view of European equities may still be some ways off.

> The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, or CESI, tracks how the economic data fare compared with expectations. The index rises when economic data exceeds Bloomberg consensus estimates and falls when data is below forecasts. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, economically, global conditions remain rather strong, as evidenced by these indices, which remain above the zero line. This reflects economic data coming in better than expected in several geographic regions. The repair of global trade activity, as supply lines are reconnected, has been notably key in non-U.S. data outcomes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blog-chart-5.27.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Looking ahead, we expect now elevated economic expectations, particularly in the U.S., may prove a tougher target. As a result ‚Äúeconomic surprises,‚Äù both in the U.S. and abroad, may fade as we move through the year. However, the overall global growth trajectory is expected to continue to be robust through 2021. Global real GDP contracted 3.3% in 2020, and it is expected to rise to +6.0% in 2021, according to Bloomberg‚Äôs consensus estimate, before ticking down to +3.4% in 2022.

> ‚ÄúAlthough high U.S. economic expectations could be tough to beat for the remainder of 2021, we still believe U.S. stocks should make up a material portion of equity portfolios. And even though economic expectations are being more readily exceeded overseas, it is tough to overlook U.S. companies‚Äô innovation and profitability advantages.‚Äù explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

> # More and More Investors Are Looking For A Correction

> The S&P 500 has been hovering around 0.5% below its record highs this week, but without a true test of those highs, sentiment has not moved very far. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment fell from 37% last week down to 36.4%. While that is the second week in a row with an absolute move less than a full percentage point in size, the marginally lower reading does leave bullish sentiment at the lowest level since the end of October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Bearish sentiment moved by even less, only rising 0.1 percentage points. At 26.4%, it still is below the reading of 27% from the first week of the month. Outside of that reading, that is the highest level since February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Bear.png))**

> This week's moves left the bull-bear spread little changed at 10. That's down 0.7 points from last week but still above the 9.5 reading from two weeks ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Once again, the highest percentage of investors are in the neutral camp at 37.1%. As was the case last week, that makes for the highest level in neutral sentiment since the first week of 2020 when it stood north of 40%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Neut.png))**

> Pivoting over to sentiment for equity newsletter writers measured in the Investors Intelligence survey, there were some more interesting moves. Bullish and bearish sentiments were not necessarily anything to gawk at similar to the AAII survey. Bullish sentiment has been on the decline with this week's survey showing a 3 percentage point drop to 51.5%, the lowest level since March 10th. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment moderated from 17.2 to 16.8%. That was the same level as the start of the month.

> The percentage of respondents ""looking for a correction"" was more notable. Rather than simply asking whether or not respondents foresee a correction in the technical sense on the horizon (a 10% decline from a high), Investors Intelligence defines a newsletter writer as ""looking for a correction"" when they are bullish on a list of stocks but at a lower price point. Coming in at 31.7%, the reading is a few percentage points above the historical average of 27.6% and is in the top quartile of the historical range. In other words, it is an elevated reading albeit far from without precedence. What is more significant is that it has been over a year since this part of the survey has seen these levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-II-Correction.png))**

> In the history of the survey dating back to 1963, there have only been eight other times that the percentage of newsletter writers looking for a correction has crossed above 30% for the first time in at least a year. The most recent of these was in April 2009. In the table below we show the S&P 500's performance in the year following those occurrences. As shown, performance has been generally positive across those past instances with average gains over the following weeks and months and moves higher at least 75% of the time one month, three months, and one year out. Additionally, while there were two times, 1982 and 2009, in which the S&P 500 rallied over the following year without looking back, there were another two times, 2001 and 2007, that at the following years' lows, the S&P 500 would end up lower by double-digit percentage points.

2021-05-29 16:13:13,stocks,He gets to go away with no worries. Win-win.
2021-05-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Maintenence Margin calculation I cant get my head around how maintenance margins are calculated, reading online says it is account equity - borrowed amount. 
It gives an example of 

An investor deposits S20,00 into a brokerage account and borrows an additional S10,000 from the broker. The investor has 30,000 to invest.
However, the maintenance margin of S7,000 must be maintained between cash and the value of the stocks. As long as the acount maintains a value of more than S7,000, the investor will not get a margin call. 

Using the above calculation i do not reach a margin of 7,000

Im only just learning these terms so please bare with me, any advice or help is greatly appreciated."
2021-05-29 07:27:58,stocks,"Your initial margin is $20,000. For margin call (MMR=$7000), account can drop by $13000"
2021-05-29 07:05:30,stocks,"I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôll be the value of the shares & cash - the value of the loan - so if the value of the shares drop by $13,000, you‚Äôll get a margin call."
2021-05-29 10:40:54,stocks,Depending on the stock or option the % can differ; also if it's a near term or long term expiration if you are trading options. I called the broker and asked the margin dept to give me the percentage on each security and option in my portfolio to get the exact amount of margin required to hold the position. So you are not surprised that your acct is liquidated one day.
2021-05-29 17:00:38,stocks,"There's opening margin minimum and maintenance margin minimum and margin and margin debt. They're usually given as percentages but you can also talk about them in dollars.

The first two are limits. The last two are the state of your account.

Margin is account value less margin debt, divided by account value to give a percentage.

The Opening Margin Minimum is how low your margin can go as the result of a given transaction.  50% is the usual number, which means you can spend twice as much money as you have, giving you (2x-1x)/2x = 1/2 = 50%.

After that transaction, your margin can go lower, because prices of things can go either way.

Maintenance Margin Minimum is how low your  margin can go after you open a position. 30% is typical.

So if the price dropped 10%, your 2x holding would be 1.8x, but the debt doesn't vary unless you add cash or sell something, so it's still 1x, and your margin is (1.8x-1x)/1.8x = .8/1.8 = 44%, which is above the 30% maintenance margin limit.

But if it had dropped 40%, you'd be at (1.2x-1x)/1.2x = .2/1.2 = 16% and you would get a margin call.

The breakpoint loss is (1-2L)/(1-L), where L is the margin limit, which is too inelegant to be remembered. It's better to just never get close to it."
2021-05-29 04:38:47,stocks,"Iduno much about margin but I‚Äôm using it and quite a bit of it.   I notice my maintenance differences daily.   I have a back up plan for if I get margin called by the way, witch I have before....also.   I‚Äôm pretty sure ( my ) broker can change it at any given time they wish as well.    Margin is great.

The main difference is that mutual funds are usually actively managed and try to achieve greater than average market returns (studies have shown they usually fail to outperform) and they tend to have higher expense ratios. Index funds just track indices, like the S&P500, and provide average market returns but have lower expense ratios."

I ordered food that my pup ended up not liking so instead of returning it, they gave me my money back and told me to donate the food to a local shelter. They also just sent a handwritten birthday card in the mail for my pup who‚Äôs about to turn 1. Ordering is a breeze since at least where I live, shipping is 1 or 2 days.

2021-05-28 21:08:32,stocks,My question is how much of a lose do they take on shipping things like dog food?  I order 2 giant bags at a time and they have to be taking a loss on the shipping.
2021-05-29 03:49:08,stocks,"$CHWY is one of my largest positions. I‚Äôm bullish as hell on it. The ease of their auto-ship, variety of their products, their unrivaled customer service and their ability to ship you medicated food/medications after interfacing directly with your vet fill a very specific need in an exploding pet industry when younger generations treat pets as a replacement for children. My mother even uses them. 

Their new distribution center should speed up shipping times and occasional inventory issues, and then they‚Äôre just Amazon Pets but doing the segment a thousand times better. They just opened a giant new office in Seattle so that will certainly aid their software and UX/UI ambitions. 

I think this one has a ton of room to run. I‚Äôd imagine better-than-expected earnings next month would satisfy concerns about it being a ‚ÄúCOVID play,‚Äù and it‚Äôll start a new leg in the 80s."
2021-05-28 21:03:04,stocks,"I love Chewy, they're a great service and I think have to some degree reshaped the dog-care market but I personally wouldn't gamble on them at the end of COVID. I hate to say it but I think spending more time with pets made a lot of people realize how much attention and material their pets actually need. It's sad to say but I think as lockdowns end that realization will slowly be lost as more pressing issues like the day-to-day of work becomes paramount in the minds of many again. As a result I think many services will probably be nullified and many recurring orders will be canceled. Perhaps I'm wrong, I do have a generally cynical outlook, but I think they were so successful this last year because they were well suited to handle the challenges of the pandemic, without it I don't know that they'll maintain the way they've been.

As always though, thats speculation and arguably pessimism."
2021-05-28 20:57:54,stocks,"I have lots of animals, so I buy a lot of pet supplies online. I use Chewy, but only because I don't like giving the Amazon monolith all of my money.

Chewy offers literally nothing that Amazon doesn't also offer, but also has a worse selection, a slighly more annoying website, and (for me) slightly higher prices because my Amazon Visa gives me discounts that Chewy doesn't have.

Basically, I like Chewy as a company, but Amazon is superior in several ways, so I wouldn't consider touching Chewy's stock. I realize the two can co-exist, but if the question is ""which one offers better growth potential"" my answer is Amazon.

I'm curious why you think Chewey has ""a ton of growth potential."" They sell pet products, which are available all over the place online. Where's the growth? I could see if they were partnering more with vets (which would be a Big Deal, because vets conglomerates [are becoming a thing](https://vcahospitals.com/)).

Their main advantage is that they have successfully marketed themselves as the opposite of the soulless machine that is Amazon, and so customers trust them when it comes to their pets. But I don‚Äôt know if basing an investment decision purely on that is a good idea."

IDXX: IDXX is a leading provider of diagnostic and information technology products and services for pet and production animal health, water quality and milk safety, and human point-of-care diagnostics. IDXX is a market leader, and thanks to a rich new product

2021-05-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Aquabounty ($AQB) poised to become the next BeyoundMeat in Seafood. Warning: Not a financial advice, do your on research before investing. 

AquaBounty is a biotechnology company based in Maynard, Massachusetts, United States. Its main goal is to develop and optimize the process of salmon farming. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved AquaBounty‚Äôs genetically engineered salmon, concluding that it is as safe to eat as any other on the market.

 In 2020, the company produced its first harvest.
Way back in 1995, biotech company AquaBounty began the process of seeking regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow the company to sell its AquAdvantage genetically enhanced Atlantic salmon to U.S. consumers. 
By integrating a Pacific Chinook salmon growth hormone gene into the genome of an Atlantic salmon, AquaBounty has reduced the fish's time to market from three years to 18 months.

 AquaBounty can produce up to 70 percent more fresh salmon annually compared to conventional Atlantic salmon grown in the same period.

It's amazing that AquaBounty could afford the 30-year slog through the ridiculously hypercautious FDA regulatory maze. The AquaBounty precedent is quite worrisome with respect to how the agency will treat fast-developing new food technologies like cell-based meats.

AquaBounty states that it sells salmon disease-free and antibiotic-free, its products have reduced carbon dioxide emissions and are not at risk of contaminating marine ecosystems like traditional sea cage farming.

AQB Stock at a Glance.

Over the past year, it‚Äôs fair to say that AQB stock swam upstream.

The share price was below the crucial $2 level in March of 2020, but by mid-November it had already broken above $4.

Then a swift and sharp run-up happened, with the buyers managing to get the share price up to a 52-week high of $13.32 on Jan. 25, 2021.

It‚Äôs usually not a great idea for traders to chase after parabolic price moves. AQB stock provides a textbook example: after topping out in January, the stock started declining steadily.

Sales have been minimal (around $127,000), but cash burn has been massive ($16.4 million in losses for 2020).

Yet, things are starting to shape up in terms of material revenue. Analyst projections call for $5.5 million in sales this year, and $10 million in sales for 2022. In the early stages of scaling up, the company will continue to operate in the red. But, with $192.3 million raised via two recent equity offerings, it has more than enough in its war chest to keep the lights on, and grow the company to the point of profitability.

Now, valuation may be a concern for some. It‚Äôs market capitalization today stands at $444.78 million. At first glance, this looks highly inflated, compared to the aforementioned near-term projections. But, with the salmon industry set to be a $36.2 billion per year business by 2026, and as demand for more environmentally sustainable protein continues to rise, there‚Äôs plenty of runway for AquaBounty.

On the afternoon of May 28, 2021, the stock was trading at $5.8. This could be an excellent buy price if you‚Äôre just discovering the stock today.

2021-05-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Dividends and why I‚Äôm long on them. From a ‚ÄúYoung Investor‚Äôs‚Äù POV Let me preface this with I‚Äôm new and still don‚Äôt fully grasp what I‚Äôm talking about completely. Don‚Äôt take my advice, do your own DD. 

Hi my usual online alias is Tragic, why? Who cares. 

I‚Äôm a 23 year old male living in the US. I have 0 secondary education however I have picked up trades in my jobs. (Welding, Soldering, Construction) I wasn‚Äôt fortunate enough to be born into a family with money. In fact I grew up thinking butter on toast was what everyone ate for breakfast and lunch and that stew was the ‚Äústandard‚Äù dinner. 

Once I moved out and got a job I didn‚Äôt, still don‚Äôt, have kids and enjoyed eating food.... a lot. Well I started realizing I don‚Äôt have any money to save up. I was living paycheck to paycheck. After a while I started getting frustrated that I can‚Äôt do anything I ‚Äúwanted‚Äù to do, but a nice car, a house, go on a real vacation. Still can‚Äôt do most of those however I‚Äôm not truly struggling. I have a savings now and I understand the risks of the stock market don‚Äôt put in what you‚Äôre not willing to lose and any company can fail. It just take one ‚ÄúOh Fudge‚Äù moment. 

I‚Äôm not gonna lie and say I‚Äôve been doing this forever. I started paying attention to the stock market during the GME craze. Never bought in an gladly so. I woulda been at the 300$ range if I tried and there was already to much risk so I wasn‚Äôt chancing it. But it got me thinking. I have my emergency money saved up why can‚Äôt I use stocks as a savings plan? Kinda...

The way I look at dividend yielding stocks is pretty simplistic. One share of T is roughly 30$ and has a quarterly payout of 52¬¢. Which means it‚Äôll take 14 years for that 1 stock to pay itself back. If I invest monthly into multiple assets that pay dividends and take that set of income and reinvest it then it‚Äôll start acting like compounding my savings account. 

I‚Äôd love to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts on this. 

It‚Äôs not a short plan but it‚Äôs one I feel confident in, and if the stocks appreciate in value then I‚Äôll be even happier! Thanks for reading!

Edit: Thanks to u/cbarksLFC for telling me about DRIP didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing and I‚Äôm adding it to my ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù notes."
2021-05-28 20:46:21,stocks,"Non dividend paying stocks also compound the exact same way. If your stock has a 5% dividend or just increases in price buy 5% it‚Äôs the same thing. However, you have to pay taxes on all those dividends so it is not tax efficient. Unrealized growth in a non dividend paying stock is not taxed. 

You shouldn‚Äôt be investing in dividend stocks at your age (im the same age) unless you seriously need the extra income which is probably not much anyway. Open a Roth IRA and you can contribute up to $6000 each year if you can afford it. Roth IRAs are funded with after tax money so any dividends or realized capital gains are not taxed. If you want to keep it simple, buy 70% VTI and 30% VXUS. Rebalance every six months. These will grow a ton by the time you retire. You can‚Äôt take out money tax free from an IRA until you are 59.5 years old unless it‚Äôs the initial contributions. By this time the money will have grown a ton and then if you want the extra income in retirement you can sell it all, paying no capital gains tax, and reinvest into dividends which you can now withdraw tax free."
2021-05-28 21:31:15,stocks,"Nobody's gonna tell him AT&T has all but confirmed they will cut their dividend, which is why the ""yield"" on it seems so high? For new investors, this is the problem with focusing on dividends and especially high yielding companies. They have high yields for a reason, most of the time being, the company's business or the company itself is distressed. As a result inexperienced investors get suckered in and constantly underperform the market for years, for example if you bought a high yielder like AT&T a few years ago, your returns are nowhere near a decent portfolio of ETFs. So, no you won't be guaranteed to make your money back in 14 years, in fact you can lose money if the company stays distressed and never turns around and there are plenty of examples of this from 2008. Your focus on dividends is too simplistic because dividends are not the only reason a company has value.

What you should be focusing on is a company's quality and its potential for present and future returns to shareholders. Now of course dividends are a part of that equation, but only a part, but so are share buybacks, M&A value, and growth potential. For example did you know that Apple's total shareholder return this year is around 5%, even though the dividend is only less than 1%? This is because of share buybacks, 90 billion dollars of it, which can be better than dividends tax-wise. This also means that if Apple's price stays the same in a year, it's market cap will go down by around 5%. This isn't to say that dividends, even high yielding ones, aren't a good thing, but they should only be a part, and often a very small part, of the reason you are investing in a company. If you wanted to invest in T, do it for the potential of a turnaround but this is a classic example of a value trap. I used to own T and it was relatively one of my worst investments."
2021-05-28 22:19:02,stocks,"If dividend investing is your thing, I highly recommend setting up a Roth IRA so that you aren‚Äôt taxed on dividends received (or capital gains)."
2021-05-29 00:02:22,stocks,Look into QYLD. It is an ETF that sells covered calls on Nasdaq stocks. Current dividend yield is 12% and they pay out monthly (so you get like 1% dividend per month).

2021-05-29 02:05:49,stocks,"VTSAX and chill dude. Hunting for dividend companies is essentially going to destroy long term value for you. 90% of what you buy that has high yield will not exist as a company beyond 30 years because the world changes and the consumer changes. Find companies that can grow and evolve with the consumer or market. Or even better, make allocated bets on companies that will change the world. 

At your age, those baskets of companies, 1 will effectively be worth millions of dollars for you by age 55+. Read Peter Thiels 0 to 1 book, it‚Äôs amazing how the guy thinks about things. He is super MAGA conservative for a tech guy but politics aside, he has an amazing mind.

Good luck with your investing."
2021-05-29 11:19:37,stocks,"Dividends are fine, and should be part of an investment strategy. there's some research showing dividend paying stocks (as a group) tend to out-perform other stocks. paying dividends is usually a sign a company is profitable and has good cashflow. and re-invested dividends account for the majority of the overall stock market's growth. http://csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/high-dividends-research-by-tweedy-browne.pdf

but dividend chasing, or seeking the highest dividends just because they're high, is not a good strategy. the dividend comes out of share price, so if you buy today for $10 and they pay a dividend of 50 cents, you have a short-term transaction that's a wash: 50 cents in cash + a $9.50 stock. if you sell quickly after getting the dividend, you have literally zero gain. EXTREMELY High dividends can be a red flag, like when a company's stock price drops and they jack up the dividend to attract buyers. or a very-high dividend stock that's in an emerging market with a shaky overall economy and unstable government. there are Russian stocks paying 10% dividends ... but the risk is investing in Russia, which is very corrupt and aggressive towards some of its neighboring countries so there's war risk."
2021-05-29 18:19:58,stocks,"Firstly, I think it's great that at 23 you're already thinking like this. I'm 10 years behind you.

&#x200B;

Secondly, there's a couple of things to get excited about as a young investor:

&#x200B;

1) Protect your capital, because ultimately, you don't need to try very hard or take many risks to make money. If you 8% a year for 40 years, you'll 19x your initial investment.

&#x200B;

2) Yield on cost is on your side. Let's say you have Microsoft at $225, yielding $2.25 a year, or 1%. That's pretty meh. But let's say MSFT continues to be successful, and down the road it's worth $3K a share and yields 1%. Well, now that's $30 a share divi that you paid $225 for. So your ""yield on cost"" is 13%. Suddenly that looks pretty fab! Evidently Buffet earns 60% on his initial Coke shares, because he bought them ""cheap"" and has held them so long.

&#x200B;

3) Cash is basically just a tool. It's there really to be used, either as an ""insurance"" product or an ""investment"" product. Leaving it in a bank is a lousy idea unless it acts as a cushion, or you have a sum of money to take advantage of any opportunities. My best mate is especially financially savvy, and overpays his mortgage when he believes the market is expensive, and then releases equity on any crash. It doesn't have to be in cash to be useful, you just have to have it easy to access. Don't meme stock it, but and probably do keep some cash (we have 6 months, I'd be fine with 3 months without dependents/mortgage), but you're losing money in a bank account."

I also have DRIPS in KMB and NJR."
2021-05-28 22:55:15,stocks,"Few thoughts...

1) Beyond the topics discussed here. Look into 1) how top open a tax advantaged account for retirement, 2) Figure out how much you need to save each year to be ready for retirement (If you start at your age 15% will do, if you put this off it could be 20%, 25% or more), and 3) create a portfolio for retirement. Do this early and the percentage you need to save stays low.

After this consider saving up a little extra that is non-retirement that will let you have access to the cash in the future. It will mostly be taxable.

&#x200B;

Dividends are too often ignored, but they're great. Just make sure you have dividend reinvesting turned on. Too many brokerage websites favor growth stocks in how they display information to investors, because they only easily report back unrealized gains %, not cumulative gains % from the investment that includes dividends and dividend reinvestments. I've always been strong in dividends. I have T, JPM, PFE, CSX, and CSCO amongst others.

I still have plenty of Growth stocks and growth stocks have outpaced value stocks for the last decade or two, even with those dividends. I really blend both sides together. I scale back my growth stocks when I think the market is getting too risky and I increase Value and Cash. When I think the bull market will last longer I buy more growth. And we have had alot of bull market lately.... perhaps a bit too much.

I also don't ignore small and mid caps. There are times these do not perform as well, but there are times they outperform.

So I have T too. I don't want to convince you ditch it, but when a dividend gets that high, it means investors are expecting it to drop in value over time. They're worried they are getting increased competition or some of their products are losing consumers to technological innovation in other parts of the market. So in response T stops reinvesting into their business and they pay out well to shareholders, while they are profitable, anticipating a slow decline in their core business.

Now some new news....And I think this is mostly good. The company is splitting into two companies, so you will soon have 2 stocks, T and a new company.  1 will be a growth company that is Time Warner + Discovery Networks (merged) that are going to try a streaming television company to take on Netflix and others. This likely won't have a dividend.  The other will be T with its original core communications business intact, with their entertainment companies removed. The dividend is going to be cut in half. They're going to start investing into 5G networks in a large scale, while selling off their cable/satellite businesses, and it is going to take capitol, so they can't pay as large of a dividend.  The down side as an investor is we know this is needed for them to compete with Verizon and T-Mobile/Sprint, but we don't know that this will actually lead to anymore revenue. We just know they have to do it to keep up with consumers expectations and competition from the other mobile carriers.

We don't know yet if they can get extra revenue from connecting cars and/or other consumer electronic devices to a 5G network that can handle more than smartphones. We know that technology is possible, but as an investor we want to know they will get more money from consumers for that investment.

&#x200B;

Also, be careful with the ""Don't put in what you're not willing to lose"" argument. That is great advice for someone who is jumping into GME, high-growth/high-risk, and non-diversified gambles. But to plan for your retirement, you really need to invest your whole retirement savings in to the correct, cautious, diversified way to make it by age 65. Rather than trying to get large gains on a gamble, you take normal market gains and let time work to your advantage.

One of the first lessons I learned was the true cost of doing nothing. When I first started I was older than you, but I had about $20k in savings accounts. I made an investment account and moved my money over (I used Merrill Edge). There is a Performance chart that will let you compare how well your whole account does over time vs. any index. I default it to S&P 500 with total returns. Nearly 8 years later it shows S&P 500 TR up over 200%. My account up 140%. I compare my account in the last 1 year, 3 year, and 5 years and I'm tracking the S&P 500 TR or slightly ahead.

My first investment was a single mutual fund that I didn't get for 5 month and I only got $3000 worth. I didn't invest the rest of my money for another year. Now that was a really good year, but it didn't go up 60%. I just no longer have those gains from the first year (1.5 years, actually) also reinvested and giving me compounded gains.

Now much of this happened because I was too busy. My work was 100% travel where I couldn't get online much, but I really wish I had simple advice that was just put it in an Index fund, like SPY or VTI, until I feel more comfortable and adequately had time to read up on everything else. My original investment could be worth an additional $12k if I had and this number will grow over time, because of the compounded gains I would've gotten with that extra $12k invested now.

There is a cost of doing nothing. Just stay clear of risky things, non-diversified things, leveraged funds, high-risk funds, etc... until you really know what you're doing, understand them, and can lose that money your risking into a riskier idea.

That is my advice to you... diversify, get it all invested, but don't rely on just a few dividend stocks. Diversify with growth stocks too.

Start simple with a market index ETF. SPY buys you a piece of everything in the S&P 500, the 500 largest companies in the market. Diversify into other investment ideas once you feel comfortable. Don't put too much money into a single stock, unless you can stand to lose it, but don't let that stop you from investing for your retirement in a diversified market fund.

The only thing that should run counter to this, is you should still have a savings account where you put emergency funds for when your car breaks, house catches on fire (happened to me Jan 2020), lose your job, etc... If that happens simultaneously with a recession or dip in the market, you want funds you can grab without worry about your investments rebounding.

Sorry for the over lengthy read...."
2021-05-28 21:25:09,stocks,"It sounds like you're confusing compounding, where earnings on assets are reinvested to generate additional earnings:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp)

with Compound Annual Growth Rate, which is a way to standardize and compare growth rates of assets over time: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp)

Dividends - particularly in tax advantaged accounts - provide cash flows that allow for the purchase of more shares, which is precisely the definition of compounding. Which is also a process that works better the longer it's allowed to operate, hence starting earlier is better!"
2021-05-28 23:26:15,stocks,"No I‚Äôm not confusing it. You would still use the CAGR formula to measure total return including dividends. The only thing that matters is total dollar value, not share value or share count. If you have $1000 of no div stock that grows 10% for 2 years, you will end up with $1210 and the same number of shares. If you have a stock with a 4% dividend and 6% growth, it‚Äôs still 10% total return per year and in 2 years you will still have $1210 of stock. You will have more shares if you reinvest dividends but the number of shares is completely irrelevant. Both of them are compound growth and as you said both are good to start ASAP. However with the dividend stock even with the same total return, the 4% dividend is taxed."

2021-05-29 08:34:48,stocks,"Use this (it may turn out that ""the dip"" is not enough of a dip):  


So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).

You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing."

2021-05-28 21:36:43,stocks,"I'll share a spread I use to invest, though these are on a UK broker and I adjust them manually, but the template (the broker has pies that allow you to select what you want and how much, then you just put money in and it buys it):

VWCE 41%

INRG 9%

VFEM 8%

IITU 7%

VUSA 6%

VHYL 5%

ISF 4%

VWCE: Vanguard FTSE All-World EUR (global coverage > singular country)

INRG: iShares Global Clean Energy (this thing is just popping off like crazy, started at 521GBX Jan 2020, hit a high of 1425 and since then declined to 921. Considering that it nearly tripled in a single year as an ETF that's understandable though)

VFEM: Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (more risky, but generally speaking higher potential)

IITU: iShares S&P 500 Information Techonology (as an IT worker I'm a sucker for IT, so that's a personal choice)

VUSA: Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (wide coverage, this time for the USA specifically)

VHYL: Vanguard FTSE All-World High Dividend (for the rougher, rather meant to counter bad times. Not really necessary at all, but I like a low percentage in it)

ISF: iShares Core FTSE 100 (covers a lot, decent return)

Usually these make up 50-80% when I pay in monthly or put in money out of other trades. The amount depends purely on what's going on right now and how many stocks I am really interested in to buy in that moment, but I always make sure that they make a minimum of 50% and that VWCE makes up at least 25% alone. The rest 20-50% are usually stocks that are at a very low price compared to what I feel would be right, judging by similar companies or the sector and think they would be a great longterm hold. In these pies I have none that are meant to be short term or mid term, but for the next 30+ years, if not more."

2021-05-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 28, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 28, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with market participants encouraged by new economic data on consumer spending, income and inflation, and a strong Weekly unemployment report. The market has made a remarkable recovery, particularly in technology, after the market tumbled 4% following the April Consumer Price Index roughly two weeks ago. In my view, as I have said for weeks, the recovery in the market confirms that the initial sell-off driven by inflationary fears forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected was overblown.

New government data on Friday showed personal income fell less than expected in April, but still pulled back after March's stimulus-fueled surge. Personal income fell by 13.1% in April compared to March, less than the 14.2% drop expected. This follows a 20.9% increase during March which had been buoyed by the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans. 

In another report, the Department of Commerce reported core personal consumption expenditures increased 3.1% in April from a year earlier, blowing past the Fed‚Äôs traditional 2% target. Federal Reserve members consider the core PCE to be the gauge of inflation. The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemic's grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. Supply-chain constraints combined, labor shortages in certain industries, and rising demand as the US economy recovers from the coronavirus-induced recession have all contributed to higher inflationary readings. These are all factors that are widely considered transitory, meaning not permanent. In an April 28 statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, ‚ÄúAn episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not likely to lead to persistent year-over-year inflation into the future. Clogged supply-chains won‚Äôt affect Federal Reserve policy because they‚Äôre temporary and expected to resolve themselves.‚Äù Moreover, he said ‚ÄúFor inflation to move up in a persistent way that moves expectations up, that would take some time, and you would think it would be likely we would be in very strong employment for that to happen.‚Äù In other words, Powell is saying he expects issues driving inflation higher to resolve themselves moving forward and doesn‚Äôt expect inflationary pressures to materialize until the labor market further improves.

In remarks this week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be ‚Äúmostly temporary‚Äù and that the Fed was ‚Äúnot quite there yet‚Äù when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be ‚Äúoverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.‚Äù 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Fed, offered a slightly different view but one that is in-line with what the Federal Reserve has already said publicly in the past. Clarida said, ‚Äúthere will come a time in upcoming meetings‚Äù when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that ‚Äúit is going to depend on the flow of data‚Äù. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn‚Äôt worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, ‚ÄúWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.‚Äù

The Department of Labor‚Äôs Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March.

2021-05-29 00:29:48,stocks,"I adjust based on macro but prior to 2020, for about 5 years, I was generally resetting to 50% cash. I usually wait till year end or early the following year depending on my write off and income situation.

Now dont misunderstand. The point isnt to hold cash long. The point is always be ready for opportunity. It doesn't always stay sidelined. For example, in 2019 I put half the cash into Tesla when it dipped. Early 2020, around Fed, I reset again (sold Tesla) and guess what happened next? 

The Covid crash was unplanned, but obviously this is what I keep cash around for (did same for financial crash)... I didnt hit the absolute bottom. I did hedge on the way down and overshot a bit on the way up but I managed to deploy all the cash at about 10% above bottom so not bad. Needless to say, my returns last year were good though nothing like the financial crash. 

By year end I started to reduce again but I made the mistake of falling in love with one my positions and have not reduced it... yea I know it sounds like a mistake but I just cant do it (lol). I can reduce some of my fixed income stuff soon (almost 1 year) so I will probably do that since those all recovered to face value anyway.

This year has been interesting. My portfolio isnt up much (about 20% so far) but the surprise has been real estate. RE usually lags at around 10%-15% yoy with rents and capital gain estimates but so far this year, that is way up. Cap gains alone are up 15%-20% so far.

That's all just me spitballing off the top of my head. The fact that we don't know what they're planning for growth, doesn't mean it's not going to happen. What we do know is all the mega tech have a stockpile of cash, a head start on any up and coming competitor, and the man power to accomplish about anything they want.

&#x200B;

""ViacomCBS Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAC; VIACA) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share on both its Class A and Class B Common Stock. The dividend will be payable on July 1, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2021.

&#x200B;

At the same time, the Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.5493 per share on its 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (NASDAQ: VIACP). The dividend will be payable on July 1, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2021.""

&#x200B;

Currently, VIAC is trading at about $42.50/share, while VIACP is trading at about $74/share, so VIACP carries less than a 2x premium over VIAC. But the dividend is 6x as much as the class A and class B shares. Can I just sell all my VIAC and get a 6x higher dividend on July 1?"

2021-05-29 00:00:00,stocks,"Be wary of stock discords Hello everyone,

I am posting here since it was removed from [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/). I apologize to the mods if this is the right content for this sub.

With the popularity of stock trading at an all-time high, I just wanted to give a small PSA and a note about my experience joining stock trading groups on discord.

Long story short, I have searched around a few different discords to join a community I could learn more about stocks and trading. I can say without a doubt, that the vast majority of them have the following scheme attached to it:

1. Are pump and dumps where the admin, claiming to be an expert, will post a daily watchlist to encourage people to buy into stocks they already have a position in.
2. Are setup to convince people they need to subscribe to daily video and ""secret advice"" in order to make a quick buck.

Some of the people that run these discords are competent and I can see use manipulation tactics to come off as an authority on subject matters and encourage group think to forward the two objectives above. If you understand and learn the fundamentals of investing, you can tell they lack substance, but people green to investing can easily be enticed.

Be careful and research into communities you plan on joining. A few common red flags of toxic stock discords I have found include:

1. Stocks recommendations that constantly change on a daily basis.
2. Cult-like praise for public figures like Elon Musk.
3. Using words and tactics to encourage group-think (Such as ""stock fam"" and encouraging the posting of daily profits).
4. Due diligence that amounts to ""This company looks dope, they have a cool product,"" or ""Their product is the future"" without providing any knowledge of fundamentals, such as finance and balance sheet.

This may sound silly, but there are people out there who are looking to capitalize hard on this craze. Some will come off as smart and can be charismatic. If you haven't read into the fundamentals of finance and investing, their advice looks very enticing.

If you are looking for a community to join, be careful and always scrutinize people's suggestions."

This weird 'bro' culture where they try to push the idea that they're all in it together and going to make it together, completely overlooking the fact that trading is a zero sum game and most of them are selling to each other and dumping bags on their fellow compatriot. It's cognitive dissonance incarnate and it's honestly sad when you realize some of them aren't just your usual easily impressionable kids gambling money with strangers for the rush and clout -- many of them have put big bucks on the line and you can tell it's more out of desperation than reason.

Unlike discord servers however, some of these subs don't simply stick to their corner of the internet and end up flooding the main subs like this and r/StockMarket (unreadable at this point) with low quality posts and downvote brigades.

The movie theatre‚Äôs 120% surge so far this week has dealt investors betting against it roughly $1.3 billion in losses, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. The stock, which has become a poster child for retail traders using Twitter and Reddit to squeeze short-sellers, soared 36% Thursday to the highest level since May 2017.

Furthermore, this kind of estimate (which is likely wrong for all the reasons you mentioned) also doesn't factor in the many ways of shorting, but is only based on the officially reported short interest. 

A hedge fund could short a security also indirectly through shorting ETFs, or selling calls, or various put strategies, or reverse conversions, or unreported naked shorts, or so many other different ways that the SI number is not only useless but actively misleading."
2021-05-28 23:10:52,stocks,"I think what happened was 'small squeezes', i.e., small funds or even individuals that were shorting and getting margin called due to the increased hype. Also many options hit itm so there's nice pressure from that direction as well.

Edit: To be clear, most of this post is nonsense. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt pay full ticket for their shorts‚Äù. Current outstanding shorts (because we know average age, unlike it was implied by the above post) were in at $14.50 at the highest. So borrow a share and sell that share for $14.50. You are positive $14.50, but now in order to close it you have to pay $25. You‚Äôre at a loss.

2021-05-29 08:57:45,stocks,"This was pretty much guaranteed to happen. A huge part of the run up was a gamma squeeze from MM and others writing so many call options. When this happens the MM hedges their bets by buying shares.  The vast majority of the people who bought the call options didn't have the liquidity (or the desire) to exercise those options and own millions of shares of AMC, so they sell them back to either bag holders, or ultimately the MM.  When they sell them back to the MM, the MM sells back the shares that they purchased to hedge that call on the open market, thus tanking the price.  I bought into some cheap OTM puts before it happened at 0.55 per contract, then dumped them over the next hour for $1.5 - $3 each. 

At the end of the day when you are looking at a gamma squeeze like this, people will need to sell if they want to realize their gains. Unless you can convince more and more bag holders to climb on board the train, the pyramid scheme will collapse sooner or later.  The best thing to do is to get out early before people start running for the hills.  Most of the pumpers with any ounce of common sense dumped their positions Friday morning, and anyone who bought into the hype on Friday is going to be a bag holder for life.  AMC is generously worth maybe $2-3 per share at most right now, after all of the dilutions and their horrible track record of generating free cash flow and returning value to the shareholder. They have no plan for innovation or growth, the company's future looks bleak at best, and 90% of the AMC valuation right now is based purely on speculation about absolutely nothing."

For example: let's say they own 30 long and 20 short positions. One of the latter grows by 20%, and now they have to get more collateral. This means deleveraging themselves, for example selling part of one long.

Now if that makes the long position decline, then they have to sell more, which in turn reduces the price more. This only works so much until it's not effective anymore. Then they start covering shorts, which increases that price, which again makes the problem worse ..


You see, it's not as simple as that. For a fund of a decent size, acting in the market effects the market. That is basically the fundamental problem of running a big hedge fund and why hedge funds under 1 billion aum are not taken seriously."

Small caps are more vulnerable to shorting I believe"
2021-05-29 09:15:49,stocks,"When they short something they create panic, people start selling and prices goes down. so, if just shorting isnt enough they can pay some media shils to publish some bullshit article and make people sell stocks so they make money. this is manipulation basically and they are insitivies to do it. many companies maybe would have a chnace, but not like this.

&#x200B;

naked short selling directly inflates worth of stock (by creating more stock) and it runs price even more down.

unethical"
2021-05-29 10:55:22,stocks,"They could have also grabbed a ton of otm calls and puts before they let it run up for some extra cash. Like the beginning of March. Lower IV, grabbed tons of $10 calls and puts( more calls than puts). Let it run up. Cashed in the calls ( that gave upwards pressure), grabbed more puts and added a ton of shorts @ $35 than slowly covered them shorts on the way down. Or held the shorts / puts for next week. I know they didn‚Äôt make enough on the calls to cover or anything like that. But I bet it was a + play, making them able to stay in the game longer. Just my option. Also all the fomo people with stop losses set helped on the way down. 

Maybe they figure if enough people fomo in, flash crash, hit stop losses enough times they will not get back in. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

2021-05-28 23:07:40,stocks,"Yes, put options have a strike price. if it isn't reached then the contract is worthless.

But it's BS, as the OP above me well said"
2021-05-29 02:33:06,stocks,"As the other poster said a put contract and selling shares short are similar in that the investor earns money when the stock goes down but they operate fundamentally differently. 

Puts can be exercised when they are out of the money but there is no reason to do so."
2021-05-29 09:34:40,stocks,You have absolutely zero knowledge of what you are talking about. You dont understand shorting and you clearly dont understand how puts work. I would watch some videos or something before you continue spreading misinformation on subjects you dont understand.

And if you got in after it started you just happened to be smart/lucky enough to hop off before it crashed back down. Again luck and simply paying to the price every day.

2021-05-29 13:32:10,stocks,"While you are right to some extend, the mechanics dont necessarily work like that. 

For example they can't just *make* it flashcrash, or else they would do it every day and people wouldnt get involved at all.

What is needed is a run-up with retail taking peofits that's when they can internalise those transactions for a while, and those sales all at once into the market.


But without retail selling, they can't internalise sell orders and therefore don't have powder"

It was expected - when I bought puts Friday morning, there were over 40k $27 puts open. A lot of this action was a gamma squeeze due to the open interest in AMC call options. The MM buys shares to hedge against the call options that they wrote, and then when people who bought the calls sell the calls back to the MM (because people rarely exercise them), the MM dumps their hedged shares on the open market and tanks the price."

What is option ""activation"" - that literally makes no sense. Synthetic shares is about risk exposure, not about literal synthetic shares.

2021-05-28 20:35:31,stocks,"This has confused me since I started investing. I can't tell whether commodities, banks, growth stocks, etc. react to actual dollar movement or the rising interest rates it causes. Commodities can crash as the dollar weakens then go back up while rates go up."

2021-05-29 04:38:06,stocks,"They react if it's big enough and if it is unexpected. The commodities, banks, etc., don't react to dollar movements and interest rates, the investors do and that's important to remember. The real value of something can go up while the perceived value, the one placed on to by investors, can go down.

Whenever something new challenges the status quo mindset, investors panic. An example is that spike in yields earlier in the year. It sent some stocks crashing precisely because it was unexpected.

Short-term movements make little sense sometimes fundamentally. Over the long term, the noise and randomness is ironed out. Plus, there's always the chance that you've missed some news or something. That's why it's important to be diversified. The markets can just be super random at times although that's slowly becoming the new normal üòÅ"

2021-05-29 06:10:13,stocks,"There‚Äôs technically three time deadlines for options, all depending whether you are short/long and brokerage/contract holder.  

The Friday 5PM expiration is between contract holder and brokerage. If buyer decides to exercise their option on expiry day, they have until 5pm to notify the brokerage.   

Saturday expiration is between brokerage and exchange. The brokerage has deadline of 11:59AM on Saturday to exercise the contract with exchange and deliver the shares.   

Short contract holders however have deadline of 4pm. It is strongly advisable not to keep contracts open until market closes on the expiry day. Low trading volume can create some very odd price movements in the aftermarket, meaning short contracts can get exercised and you have no control over it. It‚Äôs even riskier if you are holding spreads (pin risk as it has been mentioned here prior). In other words, you are risking thousands of dollars for the benefit of earning a nickel."

Then, in case I find something else I'm excited for, I often dump the tanked position completely (at losses) because I want to shift to my newer toy right away, today, get it done.

And then, the feeling of having a portfolio that I *like more* than the one before outweighs any grievances about the losses that lead there.

Does this make any sense? I'd love to hear some commentary on my ~~strategy~~ ... behaviour."

2021-05-29 08:53:24,stocks,Thanks. I come to this sub /r/stocks only to learn about what‚Äôs happening with PLTR
2021-05-29 09:08:59,stocks,"Don‚Äôt quote me on this but I believe I saw somewhere that this was a renewal of some sort (I think this was part of a 2016 deal that expired this year) Apparently the government wanted multi year deal worth over $200M. But Palantir managed to get half of that in 1 year!!!! And made them happy with a option of a 2nd year for another $52M. 

What I‚Äôm about to say is pure speculation, the government spending for Palantir is at the bottom floor. We haven‚Äôt seen anything yet. We know the government is about to spend huge on cyber and AI. No one is better positioned then Palantir. We are one of the very few with a level 5 security clearance (we are going to get level 6 sooner then later, no one will match up with PLTR) $111M for a 1 year contract is essentially 10% of the last years revenue... this is only the beginning. MSFT got $22B for hololens and $10B for Jedi... Palantir will be getting those large contracts sooner then later."

2021-05-28 21:57:45,stocks,"For me, and I imagine most people, it's that fed contracts can dry up all of a sudden. Administrations change, priorities change, agendas change. Contracts have to be reviewed and added to the budget each year. Almost every federal contract has provisions for convenience termination or defaut. They also gained a lot of traction with covid, but that won't last.

For some sectors, e.g. defense, there is huge barrier to entry and a lot of... chummy relationships to keep things going. People like to talk about how Dems will cut defense, but historically that's never really been the case. For palantir? They're not nearly as entrenched, so the relationship is more tenuous and the dependency a concern.

I haven't been able to convince myself to buy in. Could be a mistake after the pummeling they've taken recently and their ability to generate revenue, but I'd like to see more private sector adoption. I'm a dev myself and I understand what they do, but only at the surface level. That's my high level take anyway."
2021-05-29 04:10:41,stocks,I don‚Äôt mind the gov contracts but I would prefer a more equal weighting between gov contracts and private sector. At the moment it is gov contracts providing most the revenue I hope over the next 24 months this will begin to equal out.
2021-05-29 00:37:02,stocks,Time horizon my friend.
2021-05-28 20:59:31,stocks,That‚Äôs reasonable if you value like a growth software company. People routinely value it as a consulting company because their non-government offerings are still in the early stages
2021-05-29 00:28:27,stocks,It doesn‚Äôt matter when ‚Äòyou‚Äô got in! The price of the stock increased by more than 100% in around one year.
2021-05-29 03:35:55,stocks,Up 10%
2021-05-28 22:31:55,stocks,"Have to say they are pretty chummy with the US after Bin Laden. I get that was their foot in the door ‚Äî also a major score for a dem administration. They are no LMT, HAL etc but there is lots of existing proof of problem solving on PLTRs end. Tenuous relationships are a possibility but not so sure since they deal with data (obvs secrets) and some public good.

I have a similar POV that republicans talk about war, democrats will actually go to war. So that would most certainly keep the relationships rolling. Also since they deal with data, I feel it‚Äôs so hard to pull out a vendor who has that much analytics back story, let alone security protocol on simply a party change. 

Full disclosure I work in digital media and scored a small navy contract 10 years ago. It was a life changing event for my business partner and I. So I definitely have a bias toward the positivity of government contracts, also why I‚Äôm over bullish and long on PLTR. What concerns me is the absurdity of the 1Billion+ share float. If I was looking from the outside lens, that is what would prevent me from investing. I was also overly bullish and lost a ton on call spreads in the past 4 months, never quite getting there. So I‚Äôm interested in hearing all POVs, more thoughts, random thoughts and appreciate the dialogue ü•É

2021-05-28 22:35:22,stocks,Why do you think it is going to drop? What was your original thought process when you bought the put?
2021-05-28 22:33:59,stocks,"For what it is worth, I hope it works out well. I bought a 117 call for July 2nd. To break even I only need like a one percent rise, I will probably get out at that point. I post like every week that I plan to stay far away from Apple and every week I break that promise and lose more money lol."
2021-05-28 22:40:53,stocks,"Recent down trend, general hatred for apple, also have seen a couple of comments about their price target heading lower. Also assuming that gme or amc is being propped up by institutions using cash from shares of big ticket stocks like apple. Hoping it continues."
2021-05-28 22:35:34,stocks,"Well if you‚Äôre losing money on calls, perhaps my put will work out for me lol"
2021-05-29 02:52:08,stocks,"Apple is literally the most well regarded and desirable consumer brand on earth, by a huge margin. This entire comment reads like satire of WSB nonsense."

2021-05-29 01:41:03,stocks,Can someone explain the whole theory of buy high sell low?
2021-05-29 06:06:34,stocks,"My recommendation is to 1st figure out what you want to do. Are you a just here for the trade or to invest long term?

Longer term, AMC is in horrible shape. Their business was failing even before COVID so its not like this was their 1st bad year. So if you are looking for a long term investment, this is not it.

Now that being said, this recent price action has opened some doors for them. They can sell shares to reinvigorate their coffers which will allow them to venture into something else to try and be profitable again. But no one knows if they will succeed or not. Their biggest asset is that they have a real brick and mortar location but what can you do with it to bring back customers and have them spend again?"
2021-05-29 05:56:32,stocks,Don‚Äôt ever listen to people who get their research from YouTube.
2021-05-28 21:09:48,stocks,"Shouldn't more stocks in circulation drive the price down not up? Pretty sure trading fake stocks is called short stocking (could be wrong, I am pretty new to the market myself). Short stocking or legal trading, if the market believes it's real, wouldn't that mean the market believes there is more supply, driving the price down?"
2021-05-29 05:21:40,stocks,"Do some more DD. Short interest going up means they are shorting still, and you can watch how many stocks are borrowed and people are paying close attention. They aren‚Äôt covering yet because they are still trying to drive price down"
2021-05-29 05:26:18,stocks,Love how you call it deception without actually disproving anything. If it's so clearly deception then why not prove some of it wrong?

2021-05-29 14:00:14,stocks,"if anything, the fact that past trends tend to indicate future performance is enough for me. Financial markets are incredibly opaque and useful and specific information will only be made public after the dust has settled. I'd rather trust the analysis of past events as a guide to current happenings."

2021-05-29 05:33:34,stocks,People in this su reddit like to act like snobby stock experts but won't actually counter argue any of the dd. Saying thay your should take HOC with skepticism is just idiotic considering 60% of it is sourced straight from FINRA.
2021-05-29 05:56:10,stocks,"Okay man, you just look like an idiot by saying people who did their research are wrong without actually backing it up at all. Stick to F1 discussion it's more your speed."
2021-05-29 05:30:12,stocks,Got anything to back up your claim that it's impossible?
2021-05-29 06:35:32,stocks,"The issue isn't the data source (sometimes), it's the assumptions and narrative surrounding it.  There's no way to ""counter"" that, you can't disprove something that was never proven.  Just like I can't counter my neighbors claims that aliens aren't anal probing him at night. I can't prove they aren't, I can't prove a negative.  And he has sources and datasets straight from the government regarding aliens, but that doesn't mean his specific claims are true.   

Saying there should be no skepticism is just...wow."
2021-05-28 22:52:01,stocks,You're comparing the most successful company in the world to AMC.
2021-05-29 02:37:24,stocks,"Most successful? Umm, stocks don't only just go up. Therefore bagholders."
2021-05-28 21:09:30,stocks,"I am still answering my own questions and learning a bit.

So, I went to cefconnect.com and got share price and NAV data for the last time GLQ did this, which was 8/23/19 expiry.  Same terms.

I found that 85% of NAV was always higher than 95% of market price in all the time-frames I looked.  

However, market price dropped in the days leading up to the expiry date while NAV didn't move much at all.  It bottomed out on expiry and then slowly climbed back.  Without broker fees to consider, the savings for exercising one's rights in 2019 was $0.03 or 0.2792%.

The expiry date was also a good time to buy shares on the retail market since it was a low point.  But there were other lower points in September 2019, and even lower in the winter.

Last I checked, I can sell my rights for $0.10 each.  Even if I want to buy more GLQ, it seems likely that I will be better off selling the rights soon and then buying shares normally... or maybe not at all."

2021-05-29 13:04:17,stocks,"Even with the valuation, I think it's reasonable to start a small position at least. FIGS has an amazing product that I'd compare quite easily to LULU, SBUX, AAPL etc. I don't wear any scrubs as a paramedic but my girlfriend, an RN, raves about them and has loved it as a gift. 

You can make a decent bear case with the amount of competition for this type of product, but like Starbucks for specialty drinks, FIGS is well known and people are willing to pay for the quality.

Going to see how next week plays out for it."

2021-05-29 05:28:29,stocks,"Cloud computing has a huge TAM, but it‚Äôs also a super competitive space. Microsoft, Google, Amazon hold more than 50% of the market share and are growing rapidly. These companies offer everything from cloud infrastructure to cloud applications.

Cloudflare primary product is their CDN service, which allows websites to serve static assets such as videos or images quickly and securely to users. Its just one layer of the cloud infrastructure. And there are many alternative CDN providers such as Fastly, Akamai, Google cloud, Amazon web services etc.

I just don‚Äôt think cloudflare has any competitive advantage, and I think they will struggle to grow compared to the big cloud providers. Imagine you are a startup, wouldn‚Äôt you opt for Amazon, Microsoft or google? They can offer all the cloud solutions you need in one ecosystem at a low price."

Real brokers let you pick, so that you can select, for example, a larger or smaller loss, larger or smaller gain, or choose between long-term capital gains or short-term losses."
2021-05-28 22:12:36,stocks,"lol no. average is not used for taxes when specifics are available. ""Average"" is just shown for information. 

If you buy 100 at 3, then 6 months later buy 100 at 5, then the price goes to 4.50, and a year later you choose to sell - you can choose to either sell the 100@3 lot and take the long-term capital gain, or sell the 100@5 lot and take the short term loss. This is part of tax harvesting. If you have short term gains, then it may be better to take the short term loss to counter it and keep the long term gain intact for a long-term capital gains tax. 

At no point will you enter a purchase price of ""4"" on your taxes."

2021-05-29 16:32:23,stocks,"What things in particular are you talking about that don't have demand?  All hard assets have rocketed in price.  All commodities have rocketed in price.  And now all consumer non-durables are seeing significant price hikes.  And, in particular, that last item is relatively inelastic.  The vast majority of people don't decrease demand for these goods in any substantial way based on price, because they *can not*.  They have to buy food, they have to pay the electric bill (I just got a notice of a 6% QoQ hike, not YoY), and they have to put gas in the car to drive to work.  And this is why everything that counts as ""inflation"" is only in the last category.  Because no government wants to link inflation to assets, for a vast array of reasons that are all about maintaining the wealth of the ruling elites.

Inflation kills poor people quickly, because they have relatively little wage bargaining power.  And the banks want higher interest rates, but not inflation.  That's why reverse repos have spiked so massively, as well.  This is just a few big US banks trying to strong arm the Fed."
