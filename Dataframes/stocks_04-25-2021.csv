2021-04-25 19:50:46,stocks,"I used to mess around with volatile tech stocks.  I ran the up and down cycle a lot with Zoom Telephonics in the 2000s.  It would go $2 to $8 and back, all the time.  So, I bought in once, and it dropped to like $0.50.  So I held.  Eventually they stopped reporting mandatory financial info and the SEC delisted them.  Lost $8,000 or so.

Currently a GME baggie for -$6000."
2021-04-25 19:59:58,stocks,"Fuck, Luckin Coffee, I bought at ~$38 cut losses for $2.77 after the news came out of falsifying number. Lost about $3K, still pisses me off to think of it."
2021-04-25 19:34:12,stocks,Don't know the company but RSI says you're right bout the oversold part.
2021-04-25 19:44:34,stocks,"I bought into PLTR when it was 22.50. It hit 45 but I caught it at a 90% gain & I wanted 100. I do all my trades manually so I missed out on the gain. Figured it would reach it again soon.. & it steadily went right back down to where I bought it. I mean I don’t really consider it a loss because I truly believe in them long term. But I really wish I would’ve sold & got back in at a good price. Lesson fuckin learned here, believe me"
2021-04-25 19:44:17,stocks,Depending on RSI is another way to end up bag holding
2021-04-25 19:50:38,stocks,Ahh yes I also run manually. I agree you’re good with PLTR long term.
2021-04-25 19:42:39,stocks,"Those mutual funds have high expense ratios, FBALX has 25% bonds, which is high for your age. I'd just switch out everything for VT, maybe keep <10% of your portfolio for stocks you find interesting. Check out [the three fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) and r/bogleheads"
2021-04-25 19:35:34,stocks,"Congrats on being so forward-looking. This is really a great start. My advice would be to the extent possible, optimize your tax efficient spaces first. 

I assume you’re getting the full match by contributing 11% of salary pre-tax. I’d look to fund a Roth IRA before looking to contribute more to the 401k. 

Investments in those accounts are ideally going to continue to be in broad market index funds, covering both US and ex-US markets. 

Only if you took full advantage of the Roth would I look to contribute to a taxable account. I’m a big proponent of keeping things simple and maintaining the ETFs you’re buying in other accounts. This makes it easier to consider a total portfolio (all accounts) approach when allocating investments and asset classes. 

Otherwise, I always recommend to scratch the speculation itch if you have it but allocate a reasonable percentage to buying individual stocks and more speculative assets. 

I’d say overall, the savings rate is more crucial right now than hitting the biggest home runs in the market. Steadily save, any raises you’d bank and continue to save, and just keep the good work up."
2021-04-25 19:24:37,stocks,"Depending on your salary you could look into funding/maxing out an Roth IRA after you have maxed your 401k monthly payments out. Also could look into setting up auto payments with Betterment or another roboadvisor and just let them do the work. 

If I could go back 20 years to your age that is what I would do. Just get things to a set it and forget it status. 401k, IRA, extra robo / monthly ETF deposits. 

Check out Fidelity’s Basket Trading, I think it is like creating your own “etf” in the sense you select X stocks/funds and can just buy spread across. Not sure as I still need to look into it for myself."
2021-04-25 19:37:26,stocks,"You have a ROTH IRA I hope. Above and beyond anything else, you should have whatever isn't going into the 401k go into a ROTH. Google it for more details...

As a young person who so far has done a very good job getting started, I would just say put money into SPY & QQQ. Once you have some time watching how those ETFs react to different market actions, you can start adding individual stocks. 

During that time, watch the individual stocks in the DJIA. Its only 30 stocks and they are very big and well known. You will have a very good base of knowledge watching those. A few months after that, put the NASDAQ 100 into your watch list. That's about another 98 stocks for you to keep track of.

After that, you can determine if you want growth, dividends, some combination, or if you want to invest in some speculative stocks.

If you really want to get hands on, learn how to trade options. You can lose your ass if you don't know what you're doing with options, but you sound kinda smart so I bet you would be fine. You can make a lot of money with options, and most brokerages will allow option trading in IRAs."
2021-04-25 19:08:11,stocks,"Hey there I’m 26 and I personally like VBR, VOO, VWO, and VXF, I also have some money in the ARK etfs but some people like them and some don’t, i only own one single stock and that’s COST, I’m definitely more aggressive though. It seems like you’re doing alright though, the only recommendation I have is to try and eventually push that 11% into your 401k to 15% I personally believe that’s the ideal amount. FYI this isn’t financial, I am not a professional"
2021-04-25 19:14:06,stocks,"I was gonna say the same thing the other guy commented. If you have a well-paying job and you’re building up your savings quickly, you might want to think about putting more than $50 a paycheck in."

2021-04-25 19:55:07,stocks,"My employer matches 100% up to 6% of what I put in, so about half of what I put in is matched. Do you think it would be worth it to lower my contribution into my 401(k) and put that amount into a Roth IRA? 

The penny stock is the only solo stock I plan on continuing to buy going forward just for personal interest in the company and the belief I have in them. Other than that I think I’d be content with the long term savings route"
2021-04-25 19:39:52,stocks,"Although my income is high compared to my expenses, it is unfortunately not maxing out an IRA high :( 

I will definitely look into the roboadvisor and the Basket Trading. Aside from the one penny stock I mentioned, I would love to not have much to do with my investments, so that’s definitely an appealing route. Thank you!!"
2021-04-25 19:24:39,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-25 19:11:49,stocks,"I’ll definitely do some looking into those. Now that I have my cash savings to a point I feel comfortable with, I was planning on upping my 401(k) contribution, so I’m glad to have someone else’s input on that idea. Thank you for your reply!"
2021-04-25 19:35:59,stocks,"Thank you, but it was really my parents who gave me a running start in the world of financial security; they share a similar sentiment as you and I’m very fortunate to have them. 

As far as my solo stocks go: AMC and SBUX were kind of “why not?”s and they’re low percent of my portfolio. The penny stock mentioned happens to be a psychedelic medicine company I was first exposed to in my undergrad; I believe in the company and I believe their research has amazing implications for the future of mental health... I believe this is one I will continue buying into well into the future. 

As far as the sector funds, I bought those pretty early on when I was unsure what I was really doing (still don’t really know, but I’m getting there). They all have pretty decent % returns (9-14%), so I’m planning on holding, but unsure of buying more. 

You bring up a compelling point with SPY. I was unsure about going all in on one fund for diversification reasons, but, and this just occurred to me, that is already a VERY diversified fund"

2021-04-25 18:45:57,stocks,"Someone told me long ago to invest in things people use everyday, and even moreso when things get bad. Kimberly Clark, Johnson & Johnson, Hormel, etc."
2021-04-25 19:09:05,stocks,"I’d argue that inflation doesn’t really hurt the stock market and you shouldn’t change your strategy because of it. Inflation causes people to get out of the bond market, since the money in a 10 year bond won’t be worth as much if inflation is high. Because of this, inflation affects the bond market more than the stock market. 

Inflation is a reason that people get INTO investing. If your money loses 2% in value every year by sitting in a bank account (inflation), you’re gonna want to invest so that your money maintains or exceeds its value over time. Inflation could be seen as more of an incentive to get into the stock market, not less.

I think growth stocks could move anyway since people don’t understand that their stocks should be fine. Not many young investors know/understand this, so (if your worried about that happening) it might be good to get out of young people investments like growth stocks and get into old people investments like Mcdonalds or Coca-Cola if you don’t want THEIR ignorance to hurt YOUR portfolio. 

As for the capital gains tax, that will affect all areas of investing and i don’t think there’d be a sure way to completely avoid it. I suppose less risky stocks (like the ones you mentioned) would minimize the losses though. The big question to ask yourself is “do i think the capital gains tax is actually going to be increased? Should i decrease my risk?”

And the answer to those questions are for you to decide, not some random person you’ve never met on the internet. 

Good luck"

2021-04-25 19:11:57,stocks,Wouldn’t trust Costco too much. It did drop to 309 a month ago from 388. That’s a huge drop for a company that’s been kinda too heavy stock wise.

2021-04-25 18:27:31,stocks,Next time Mercury and Mars retrograde simultaneously
2021-04-25 17:42:59,stocks,I sell covered calls against my whole portfolio at strike prices that I would be comfortable selling my shares at. I own most individual stocks and etfs tho. No index funds
2021-04-25 18:42:31,stocks,Check out XYLD. It basically is an ETF index that owns SP500 and sells covered calls against it. Pays out a monthly dividend from the premiums received. That’s a decent backtest of the strategy. Obvious downside is that your upside is capped when you do this so the best months you might not get the full gain of an unhedged position.
2021-04-25 17:58:03,stocks,"I did that with VYM in my Roth one month ago. Sold 2 at strike of 102 for 5/21 and another 2 at 103 strike same day expiration. Delta was at .3 both trades(made a few days apart). Took~$400 in premiums.

Looking like I'll be getting mine exercised at this point!! I'll have to sell a cash covered put to get them back! Lord knows if I'll be able to!"
2021-04-25 18:44:15,stocks,"You're never actually at risk of losing your shares, unless you want to lose them. 

You sell OTM CCs at $1, the underlying goes up and the CCs are worth $1.50 now. Your choices are 1) let the option get exercised or 2) buy to close the CC and add an option leg for sell to open CC at the next week or month at the next higher strike price. This way you can keep rolling your CCs forward. 

I do this constantly and it's a great way to keep extracting time value on a CC even long after the underlying blows past the strike price on your first CC."
2021-04-25 17:50:56,stocks,That’s basically my dream to sell OTM CCs on SPY one day in my Roth so I don’t have to worry about taxes either

2021-04-25 18:21:10,stocks,I honestly can’t see what’s wrong with it. Even selling way ofm for like 5 cent premiums is better than just owning

2021-04-25 18:06:01,stocks,"Yep. I don’t try to play the guessing game or where it might be and go just above that to get maximum premium.

I own 100 shares of PLTR - I sell monthlies at a price that would give me 25% gain. If it jumps up and sells - cool. If it doesn’t - oh well. I’ll take my premium and buy more."
2021-04-25 18:07:09,stocks,"I do the same, unless I think something is about to explode. I just rarely see people suggest it for index funds."
2021-04-25 18:14:13,stocks,"One warning about this strategy: don't use it on anything that might collapse after hours. Many brokerages won't let you hold naked calls, and you can't sell options with the market closed. So, if there is some news that causes shares to plummet when the market is closed, you might not be able to sell your shares until the next day because of the covered call."
2021-04-25 19:02:17,stocks,"Interesting. My specific strategy is to sell CCs on unsustainable peaks, so I might not necessarily do it every time my CCs expire. I'll take a look a XYLD's strategy to see what deltas and expirations they use, and when they sell."
2021-04-25 18:49:22,stocks,"For example... UMC just blew past my $10 strike price. Everyone is bullish on this, so I rolled my CC from May to July. I get another $200 in my pocket and if it keeps going up then I'll do it again next month.

2021-04-25 18:39:01,stocks,Check out XYLD. ETF that basically does that for you.
2021-04-25 18:11:31,stocks,"For a small position, it's probably a waste of time, but once you have a large enough position, you can choose a small delta that can make an non-negligible absolute amount of cash each month. It's certainly not a method for getting rich, but for a position you plan on accumulating forever, it eventually becomes a nice way to pay for monthly expenses."
2021-04-25 18:14:39,stocks,Yes I have 400 shares of pltr and have been making decent premiums. I don’t really mind watching it trade sideways because I’m still making money haha
2021-04-25 18:55:02,stocks,Just wondering... what strike did you play during the month of April? I also own 100 shares at 22.34 and have been trying to play weeklies but IV has been mediocre and I can’t seem to find a comfortable strike with reasonable premium.
2021-04-25 19:49:50,stocks,The high iv helps too.
2021-04-25 19:16:21,stocks,"I think they are pretty much always covered, so even the call selling is programmatic. Makes sense since correctly predicting a peak to be unsustainable is just another way of timing the market."

There’s no way to predict 18 years of market movement, and I find it hard to imagine the top performers of the last 18 years would do similarly again. 

That would put, eg, Apple at a $930 trillion market cap.

2021-04-25 17:24:10,stocks,"People who say “don’t trust Wall Street analysts” aren’t thinking about it in the right way. Regardless of whether you think they’re smart or not it’s still important to understand what they think because their research is so widely distributed and trusted. I ALWAYS recommend you do you own work and verify what they say - they’re less likely to be negative on a company because they have relationships with management ....unless they have very strong conviction. So with that I’ll say this...

1. It depends on the stock you are looking at - some banks have better health care analysts and other banks have better TMT teams. Really do your research about an analysts track records. Did they work in the industry? Have they broken out from the group in their predictions? What is their track record? 

2. Analysts that cover stocks where THEIR bank was the book runner on an IPO tend to be a bit bias - so look that up and be careful there.

3. Analysts who are negative on companies are more trust worthy (unless they have a known beef with management) because they ruin their chances at corporate access for the bank (roadshows, conferences, etc) if they constantly trash a company. Management will stop talking to them or wasting their time at their events.

4. The group think among fundamental equity research analysts on Wall Street is problematic, but it could pose an opportunity for you. If every analyst for a given stock is talking about issues X, Y and Z, but you think that issue A and B are being overlooked, there are likely a lot of people out there overlooking those issues, So they’re worth spending more time on!! 

5. Reading analyst research can be a really good shortcut for getting the sense of a company before you dig into deeper research. It can highlight trends and issues that might take you a while to find on your own if they’re not heavily reported. 

TL;DR - I wouldn’t base your investment decisions solely on sell-side research, but understanding what they’re saying and what they care about can but a super helpful tool for your process!"

2021-04-25 16:51:23,stocks,"Your question may involve Sales block allocations.  This website helped me:  [https://greentradertax.com/services/consulting/](https://greentradertax.com/services/consulting/)

The Wall Street Journal had an article about traders on RH getting screwed over by not being able to allocate losses and gains to specific blocks of a stock purchased at different times.  You also may have long term capital gain versus a short term capital gain depending upon which block of stock you allocated the sale too.  Some brokerages let you do that and some automatically do it a specific way unless you instruct them otherwise.  RH required the trader to call them and direct which block they were selling."
2021-04-25 17:06:49,stocks,"Most brokers sell the oldest lot first. You could ask if they can sell the newer lots if you are long. Example, you bought 100 share of ABC 01.01.2020 and then bought 50 shares on 05.01.2020. You need to liquidate 20 shares since you need the cash on 09.01.2020. You can aak if they will sell the lot from 05.01 instead of the ones from 01.01 since you only need 3 more month of holding to make them 1 year."

2021-04-25 15:41:57,stocks,"Invest in what you already have. Its cool to diversify and stuff but if you just opened your acc you should definitely be putting into your ETF especially if it pays a dividend. If not I guess you could diversify now. Personally have VTI etf, VOO is a good one too tho."
2021-04-25 15:53:57,stocks,"As far as VOO or VOO + VTV + VYM I'd say because of your age, the investing zeitgeist dictates you ought to be aggressive and so it would probably suggest you to just stay in VOO and funds like that, perhaps with diversification in emerging markets or well-established international markets following a similar structure as VOO. VTI is also a fine option versus VOO---higher dividend, slightly lower long-term capital gain, but similar downside exposure. VTV and VYM are probably slightly more conservative, but they're still far riskier in the retirement picture versus like bonds/cash and still subject to lose just as much if not more than VOO in a serious market downturn. 

I dunno; I'd probably just slowly DCA mostly into VOO, partly into VTI (maybe), and look into perhaps getting exposure to stable markets outside the US. My retirement is like 75% funds like these and the rest are an assortment of foreign growth, value, and a teeny tiny portion of bonds."
2021-04-25 15:58:59,stocks,"It's been said already, but sticking with what you have seems fine. 

If you were trying to diversify, common wisdom suggests putting some into an emerging or eupean market tacking ETF (VWO or EFA for example) to hedge against US market fluctuations. The classical suggestion is 10-15% of your portfolio. The US market seems be be a bit over valued right now, so a correction could hurt if heavy into VOO, but in the long run it would probably be fine even if that happened.

Side note, be careful picking 'sector specific' ETFs of you do choose to do that. Some of them may appear to be tracking some industry, but are actively managed and come with a high expense ratio. Those types are rarely worth the price, especially in the long term."
2021-04-25 19:44:46,stocks,No QQQ?  I like it personally.
2021-04-25 15:54:33,stocks,"Focus on TOTAL return. Making decisions based on dividends oftentimes leads to worse outcomes. 

Also, adding VYM or VTV isn’t really giving you better diversification. It’s simply adding a tilt to your portfolio. 

Stick with VOO or VTI."
2021-04-25 16:58:50,stocks,"Good so far. It’s all about what your personal goals are and planning how to diversify around that. I’m nowhere close to retirement age so i want to be primarily in growth ETFs. Diversification for me revolves around being in multiple industries and not so much about balancing out growth vs dividend investments. 

I’d say you’re definitely in the right direction for you. Take other people’s advice with a grain of salt. An 18 year old has different views than a 34 year old of how to invest."
2021-04-25 18:34:58,stocks,"As far as VOO and VTI that's fairly interchangeable.

Personally I don't mind having some overlap between ETFs so long as their theses and general investing strategies are different. That would be outside of broad market ETFs though.

Ultimately if you start purchasing different ETFs you'll inevitably have some crossover."
2021-04-25 15:09:26,stocks,"Why do you want to get into QDEL specifically? What about the business appeals to you where you believe there’s a substantial under appreciation? I don’t necessarily disagree with you, just want to push you on your thought process."
2021-04-25 15:18:21,stocks,"It was volatile during the pandemic because they sell COVID tests, and the market was trying to price that out while QDEL was making money hand-over-fist. That revenue stream is already dying, and it'll go back to a normal growth trend once it corrects fully.  I doubt it's going back to 300 anytime soon."
2021-04-25 15:51:23,stocks,"I’ve been looking into QDEL intently and hope to soon make a full post on my findings.

That being said, what I can say now is that for most of the past 15 years Quidel as a company seemed a bit *meh* when it came to revenue and EPS growth. Looking at a price chart (I use macrotrends.net) we see the stock rangebound for a decade until it first broke out in early 2018. This was no accident; Quidel was finally able to generate impressive YoY revenue growth *and* began to turn a profit because.....the 2017-18 flu season in the U.S. was one of the gnarliest in recent memory.

It’s important as a beginning investor to know what is driving the revenue of the company you’re investing in...for Quidel, it was first the manufacturing of flu tests, and starting last year they were among the first to branch into producing COVID tests en masse. They generated great revenue and profits off of their COVID tests last year, truly unprecedented numbers in their history, and the stock price soared off of these figures. What were the three words most uttered last year if they weren’t “testing, testing, testing”? So while taking a backseat to say, Zoom Video in terms of popularity among investors, nevertheless a robust testing apparatus was as important to the pandemic response as robust remote communications was.

What’s happening with the share price now is twofold...I believe investors are first looking to sell off the companies that most benefitted during the pandemic...think a company like Peloton too along with Zoom and Quidel. The second aspect of QDEL’s decline is that, because of the masking and social distancing protocols we all adhered to this past flu season, well, we didn’t really have a flu season did we? As a result, Quidel had to come out and say their revenue figures would be less than expected because a big moneymaker for them—flu tests—went unneeded this past year. Pair that with the mass rollout of COVID vaccinations, and we could see a *much reduced need* for both COVID and flu tests in the next 12 months. 

While valuations on QDEL are too good to be true at the moment (like P/E of 6 and a P/S of 3, for instance), I would say that it’s important for the stock to have a couple weeks of no further downtrends before deciding to jump in. I personally don’t think flu and COVID tests will be done away with entirely. In fact I think we’ve become a lot more health-conscious over the past 12 months, and more people in the future will look to test for all sorts of infectious diseases before deciding to go to work/school when feeling ill.

TL;DR: Investing in QDEL is basically a decision on whether you think cold/flu/COVID testing will play a big part in our lives in the future. While valuations at the moment are too good to be true, I’d steer clear from investing in the stock until we see some price stability...don’t want to be catching a falling knife!"
2021-04-25 18:30:04,stocks,"The valuation based on the EV/EBITDA(4.25) is fairly low which means the company is likely undervalued.

Has more cash equivalent than the debt which is good.

It's down for a reason though so it's more of a value investment.

DYOR"
2021-04-25 15:34:53,stocks,"First, ask yourself why you think it will peak soon? Remember, QDEL sells covid tests so that brought in a ton of volatility last year! If I were you, I would find a better stock that can continue to do well, even after the pandemic, or a reopening play.

Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't they fall because something to do with poor earnings? I don't follow QDEL very closely anymore, so I don't know for sure"
2021-04-25 16:06:20,stocks,"The price of $300 was due to Covid test. Right now, is highly improbable QDEL could be at that price soon (unless a new pandemic began...)."
2021-04-25 18:43:20,stocks,"The valuation has fallen near pre-covid level of$80, price is still downtrending, but not unreasonable. Genomic is going to play a bigger part of the future according to ARK Cathie Wood, so it may grow at a faster pace than years before."

2021-04-25 19:00:14,stocks,We used to use Quidel for our research but now we have switched back to our original manufacturer. They had a good antigen testing kit but we don't have much use for it anymore.
2021-04-25 16:20:34,stocks,"I kinda agree here, but I think testing will be a big part of the future. Been slowly buying QDEL since 136 as a long-term play. I'm about 20% done with my planned position. I'll continue to add a little bit every couple weeks. A 10 to 20 percent dip doesn't really bother me... COVID or influenza are going to be a part of life going forward."
2021-04-25 16:02:48,stocks,"Thank you, perfectly written. Very helpful."
2021-04-25 16:16:09,stocks,"Yeah I’d say it’s super uncertain whether covid growth can lead to meaningful business expansion going forward. HOLX I think may be better equipped to do so, but even then I don’t think growth for them will be substantially different than in the past. Just an expansion in base units installed led to a sharp jump and growth will be the same from that point on."
2021-04-25 17:38:36,stocks,"They don't only sell COVID tests.  The initial 15% or so drop was because they were at some conference and told the plain truth: FY 2021 is going to be way under FY 2020, because the COVID cash is going to dry up.  The next whatever % was for the same reason...i.e. earnings confirmation of what they already told everyone.

Their EPS went from 2.97 in 2019 to 19.92 in 2020. And the 2021 estimates were around 26, which obviously is absurd now--unless the pandemic has another breakout this year.  PE(ttm) right now is 6.2 at 18.59 EPS. If EPS drops back to 3 (worst case), then the forward PE is like 36.  There's probably still going to be carryover testing into 2021 though, so EPS will probably be somewhere in the middle."
2021-04-25 18:34:27,stocks,"That’s not the point and I hope you can understand why. It’s about comparing QDEL to other attractive opportunities. If QDEL is “just ok”, but there are better options I could allocate that 1k to, then the move is obvious. Challenging OP’s thought process can help decide the course of action."

Trump's social media site could be a success but I don't think it will have a big amount of users on there. Probably a small amount of the political account's will move there or people will use both of the apps at once"
2021-04-25 13:50:20,stocks,"Trump got 74 million votes. Facebook has 2.8 billion active monthly users and Instagram has 1 billion active monthly active users. Even if you got every Trump voter to leave Facebook (which they aren't) its not as big of a hit as you think. 

Social Media is a natural monopoly and Facebook's moat is stronger than people give it credit for."
2021-04-25 13:09:56,stocks,"I see Frank usage skyrocketing soon. Don’t sleep on my pillow guy...crack or not, dude’s a billionaire."
2021-04-25 17:19:57,stocks,That’s part of it and from what I can observe they use iMessage for more formal and business type messages.  Example a boss or maybe parents.  But ya they absolutely love other apple products.
2021-04-25 13:02:46,stocks,"I literally don’t see Trump succeeding in this unless it’s driven by people like Thiel who are astute and have product vision 

For a social media platform, there needs to be other components like Amazon web service or azure and other infrastructure and security on top ( it will be a constant target of work hackers), so it’s not viable. It will collapse like Don’s businesses 

Facebook is not a long term viable business. They are at the mercy of Apple and Microsoft and Amazon who control the ecosystem."
2021-04-25 13:02:52,stocks,"Possibly, but i think freedom of speech and the continued censorship of tens of millions of people around the world will prove otherwise."
2021-04-25 13:07:17,stocks,"Yeah I can see it being a 2 app system. 

The Trump app however will be a big hit and everyone will say they will never use it but they will have it just so they can bitch about what is on there. 
I definitely dont think this is gonna be a game changer unless people actually leave the other sites. 

Back to apple vs Facebook though who knows I do expect Apple's to be a success but like anyone else like me I do not buy apple products so I wont be able to use it. Maybe since it is more of an app maybe they can make it available to android but make a premium version for Apple people you know extra bells and whistles."
2021-04-25 15:32:13,stocks,That website is horrible lol. It looks like it was coded in HTML 5 only.
2021-04-25 13:12:32,stocks,"Yeah I agree with you Facebook are at the mercy of apple and Google but they are still successful and they have the most eyes on their platform it's hard to see people leaving the platform. Facebook are also investing in to other areas like India and they are also investing heavily in VR and AR.

Facebook is also great for small business and for people advertising also they are investing in to eccomere at the same time with like Instagram shop and Facebook marketplace which is growing and looks like they are going to compete with match group with online dating.

This is a exciting company and its my biggest position"
2021-04-25 15:31:32,stocks,How can people say this with a straight face and not see the contradiction?
2021-04-25 13:16:48,stocks,"Yeahh the apple social media venture isn't going to be a guaranteed success.

The likes of Google have tried to compete with Facebook but they have failed

Facebook are also investing heavily in to Their app and they are trying to integrating them for example they want to change Instagram DM to Facebook messenger so people are able to message from Facebook to Instagram.

Let's not forget about Facebooks other projects"
2021-04-25 16:02:31,stocks,Do you think those knuckle staggers care?
2021-04-25 15:04:49,stocks,"I use fidelity and I am also short some stocks. This is the first time I've heard of a securities lending program in Fidelity but it's not the first brokerage to do this, IBKR also has a lending program, so the way it works should be similar. The 8.5% example is kind of extreme, but the actual yield you would get is based on how in-demand the stock is to short compared to the float, which is also the ""hard-to-borrow"" fee. For example, not very many people are short Microsoft stock so the stock is not in demand. Therefore, the cost of borrowing MSFT stock to short is not very high, essentially 0%. This means if you lend out MSFT shares, you will get basically a 0% yield. You can check the actual percentage on Fidelity when you short or [iborrowdesk] (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/MSFT), which tracks IBKR's rates. Loaning shares is not some scam though, and many funds short stocks as a hedge, so getting the borrow fee is essentially free money if you want to hold for a long time."
2021-04-25 14:12:08,stocks,"I would say you should take that offer, especially on the likes of your safe holdings if at all possible. It seems to be a guaranteed 8.5%, and you keep any profits from your shares, if I'm not mistaken. I'd say you should do your own research into it, but if it is a risk-free 8.5%, I don't see any downside to taking it."
2021-04-25 12:19:57,stocks,which meme stock?
2021-04-25 18:01:18,stocks,You aren’t going to get 8.5% from MSFT or APPL.
2021-04-25 17:17:37,stocks,Not right now!  Wait until after ShortGate is over.
2021-04-25 14:21:09,stocks,"Maybe I’m missing the point....


What’s the point of loaning out shares if I can still sell shares, having voting rights, maintain ownership, etc? That’s like loaning out my car to someone yet I still can drive and sell my car. 


I too am eligible, however this is the first I’ve heard of this program.


Edit: Ohhh. So this is where short sellers get their shares to sell. This makes more sense."
2021-04-25 12:24:22,stocks,They are trying to pay you 8.5 so all the other big guys don’t have to pay the people that actually hold the shares >300%
2021-04-25 14:40:56,stocks,"I understood this so that you get that 8.5% from actually lent stocks. If 10% of your portfolio is lent out, you get 0.85% return on your whole portfolio. Don't be disappointed if returns are smaller than expected.

I'm wondering how they distribute the lending between customers signed up to the program. Does everybody get a slice of lending? Is that slice proportional to their ownership? Or are there preferred customers who get all their stocks lent out first?

Finally a thought. If you happen to get a high lending ratio to your portfolio, it may be a sign that there's a lot risk. In conventional investing choosing highly shorted stocks is not a winner strategy. There's a cult of new investors who think otherwise though."
2021-04-25 19:46:58,stocks,Dropping prices effect market perception
2021-04-25 14:43:07,stocks,"Look at the fine print. If the lessee loses ownership via exercised options, this may mean they buy it from the lessor and the later is taxed on the sale."
2021-04-25 12:19:41,stocks,You better not be talking about loaning amc shares......
2021-04-25 14:43:01,stocks,90% of us on here don't have $250k+ in a brokerage. This probably isn't the best forum.
2021-04-25 12:18:07,stocks,Nah
2021-04-25 16:16:36,stocks,Interesting... so I could get margin at 6.5%and then loan out at 8.5%thereby collecting 2% risk free yield?
2021-04-25 12:30:30,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-25 14:56:29,stocks,"They're borrowing them from you to short them.

What are the risks associated with fully paid lending?

>...And, short selling activity may impact the price of your security.

 I'd say this is only a good idea for people with a very long-term horizon.  It lets you make a little extra money through the downtrends you were going to sit through anyway."
2021-04-25 17:00:04,stocks,"Well to that I'd say, what if they wreck your car. Your share can be used to devalue itself."
2021-04-25 12:35:23,stocks,Thanks. This is good advice - .*..but share lending is what throws cold water on the rocket...*

""While Tesla has navigated a myriad of Chinese government PR issues,  chip shortages, and a further spotlight on its auto pilot safety record  (given the Texas crash) over the past month, the Street is now laser  focused on gauging the annual delivery trajectory for 2021,"" previews  analyst Dan Ives. The conference call set for April 26 at 4:30 p.m.  takes on some added significance with the news flow working against  Tesla over the last week.

""We  strongly believe the tide is shifting in the cloud arms race as  Microsoft should deliver a \~45% Azure growth number this quarter and is  clearly taking market share vs. AWS based on our analysis. While we have  seen the momentum of this backdrop in the last few quarters, we believe  deal flow looks strong heading into the rest of FY21 and FY22 as we  estimate that Microsoft in particular is still only \~35% through  penetrating its unparalleled installed base on the cloud transition,""  updates analyst Dan Ives.

A list of 16 stocks was generated based off a filter of  Buy-rated stocks with three-year dividend growth rate forecast at least  at a high single digit rate, with a current dividend yield that beats  the S&P's yield, sustainable payout ratios and sitting with more  than 10% potential upside to price targets.

As that's not the case at all...frankly, I'm leaning toward some names going higher this time because of this attitude being prevalent unless something extenuating happens again to cancel it out like it did in January.

2021-04-25 15:50:27,stocks,"Not always. Crushing earnings by blowing the earnings target away is actually an orange-to-rred flag for analysts because it means the company either missed something or don't understand their market. It can be treated as an earnings miss and should at least prompt a hard look at the reasons behind it because it might not be sustainable - Netflix is a good example of that.

That's by far the most simple risk averse approach, generating long term cash return and some capital gains. You can always just simply dump everything into faangm stocks but not really useful.

I'd suggest you take a look at some of the biggest ETFs out there and decide for yourself, which one you want to take. If something happens (which is not very likely imo) you don't want to blame someone else instead of doing your own dd - it's a lot of money, so it's worth to invest some time into choosing what fits you best.

2021-04-25 11:15:29,stocks,"First of all - find a new bank... If 6 figures is only yielding you $2/mo they’re ripping you off. 

Secondly - index funds are low(er) risk and help with diversification. If this is long term that’s your best bet but don’t sit there and watch it every day - you’re not going to be green consistently and if there is a market downturn hold on and sit tight and buy the dip. Also with 6 figures perhaps you want to consider something more tangible (real estate?) if you think the stock market is corrupt/rigged. At least then you own physical assets."

If earnings are good, stock probably rise (of cause Intel fell because its all about growth, not just good earnings). 

Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are safest bet. No matter how bad/good earnings are, stock will go up no matter what (can fall temporary).

Amazon is strong company but it will be same as Netflix? Covid-19 is over, no more huge profit after Covid-19... sure... cloud, video stream but really... people want to travel, spend time outside etc.  I think Amazon won't grow or fall.

Tesla earnings is most important thing right now. If earnings are mind blowing, stock probably rise a lot. But if earnings are not so good, probably all other car stocks rise and Tesla fall.

2021-04-25 00:00:00,stocks,"CTRE (CareTrust) REIT I’m long on this position. Currently have ~100 shares. I’m here to tell you why. 

This is a healthcare REIT, I work in healthcare but am not associated with this type of care. 

~75% of their portfolio is involved with skilled nursing facilities. The rest is mostly senior housing. With the aging population this is a great play. They currently own 238 properties in the US. 

FFO growth CAGR: 1 yr 3.1%, 3 yr 16.1%, 5 yr 21.2%. This reflects good income growth over the long term. 

FFO/Share CAGR: 1 yr 1.5%, 3 yr 4.5%, 5 yr 5.9%.  Both of these growth rates are ahead of their peers and indicate the company has good growth towards the future. This is to be expected with the aging population; more people become old and need more help = more customers. 

Price/ffo is a little high compared to the average: 17.67x vs 5 yr avg 14.84x. 

Debt/asset is safe: 36.3%
Debt/ebitda: 3.4x
Maturity of debt is in 3-5 years so they have time to grow more with what they have. 

Dividend of 1$/yr. 
dividend growth: 1 yr 11.1%, 3 yr 10.6%, 5 yr 10.1%. 
Dividend growth is steady and occurs y/y. 
Payout ratio is 72.5% which is good in REITs. 

Overall this is one of my higher convictions and I add every month to it. I believe in it more than most equities out there. They have a strong leadership group and are growing at a good rate without taking on too much debt. This is a stock you buy and retire with. Cheers. 

I got my info from alreits.com. Thanks."

2021-04-25 18:52:16,stocks,"Thanks for the DD! I started really digging into healthcare REITs because of this post, so thanks for making me rich in the future! There's a lot of old people getting older out there (source: [https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/65-older-population-grows.html](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/65-older-population-grows.html)). When you compare the number of people in the Baby Boomer generation versus the generation before it (the silent generation), there's 3.4x the number of people (71.6M vs 20.9M), so I think looking for 3.4x the number of facilities in the US in the next couple of decades is a reasonable expectation. This sector should explode. 

I have 2 questions, on this, though. And I'm new to doing my own DD so I already know I'm an idiot if the below questions have obvious answers:

I think you're right that the price/FFO is considerably lower than some of the other healthcare REITs out there (like VTR, WELL, PEAK) which all have price/FFO nearly 10x what CTRE has. Is the case for CTRE compared to VTR/WELL/PEAK just because it's a smaller company with more room to grow faster?

Also, you say the debt/asset ratio is safe, but is having the lowest debt/asset ratios in something like a REIT a good thing? Wouldn't you want their debt to asset ratio higher because that means more of your money as a share holder is actually going into physical property? Obviously there's some cutoff that's too risky, but all the competition seems to be in the 50% range for debt/assets."

2021-04-25 11:17:52,stocks,"(fuck, this got long...oh well)

I'm hardly one to judge but I don't think you're crazy. 

I'm bullish on BABA but I think the recovery will take a little time. I also think that will happen before the end of the year and may all happen in a few days. Here are the catalysts imo that take it back to $300:

1. ~~BABA pays big fine for anti-competitive practices~~
2. ~~Agrees to drop pick-1-of-2 rule (which of course they have to b/c RCEP)~~
3. Jack Ma divests from Ant Group. I think there's fire under this smoke. The CCP does love winning personality conflicts and divesting Ma from Ant would be their favorite kinda fuck-you without costing the company anything. BABA/Ant can still be all the behemoth they want to be without Ma. Still Ma's exit could take a few weeks to sort-out the details. I think Ma might be less peeved about it than people think. There's a chance he was going to exit Ant after the IPO anyway, sorta like he moved-on from BABA.
4. Ant Group gets greenlight for IPO as a normal-ish bank (not a loan-writing factory). That's going to be like at $20 day for BABA easy imo. There's just so little bear case for BABA outside of ""well, the CCP is gonna git 'em!"". Once all the shoes have dropped, BABA's P/E might shoot back up to other tech giants. 

Once Ant IPO's and (perhaps) Ma is out of the picture, I think you might see the CCP flipping script and getting back to pushing BABA (and similar companies) to expand and grow into the markets that RCEP has created. The anti-monopoly actions are alibi's for the WTO dimension of a future conflict the CCP is interested in winning: the battle for pacific market expansion. The PRC needs the appearance of due diligence. They want to look like a country that's hard on monopolies and still have monopolies. (Same as the US). RCEP is the biggest trading block on the planet. The US isn't in it. And the PRC finished it on the heels of 4 years of the most fucking moronic foreign policy execution in the history of the USA. (Anybody's feathers get ruffled by the last statement, I'd be glad to make that point in long form).

PRC's actions against BABA are by design 20:1 bark-to-bite ratio. Eventually it will recover as the theatrics conclude."
2021-04-25 09:17:58,stocks,"The price of this and other Chinese stocks is going to correlate with US-China relations. I think BABA will be $300 at some point, but I dont think it will be anytime soon."
2021-04-25 08:44:13,stocks,"You are aiming for +30% gains in 8 months, that is not realistic for any company. You need to adjust your expectations. Wait 3 or 4 years and you will most likely get a good return on your original investment."
2021-04-25 09:51:00,stocks,"A lot of hedgefunds are buying BABA.. the rally is coming.. 

Also 100% of analysis across the globe have BABA at over $300 in next 12 months...  crazy i know.."
2021-04-25 12:09:11,stocks,My theory on BABA is that China can’t claim the title of Worlds largest economy and not have a single $Trillion dollar company while America has 5 +. It will be like the space race. If China wants to appear to be the best they need to have the largest companies by market cap too. BABA should be the first Trillion $ China stock.
2021-04-25 10:25:15,stocks,"Anyone who actually lives in China knows how BABA is doing/is perceived with increased e-commerce competition from Meituan, JD, and Pinduoduo? Feel like this thread is about CCP, Jack Ma, and delisting but those aren’t at the top of the list of things I care about with this company."
2021-04-25 12:09:34,stocks,"From my point of view, it is not happening only on BABA. There are a few ADR stock from China whose price are specially down if we compare to the rest of the market. We can see on BABA, CTK, RYB... It could be an interesting choice now to invest in some of them at these levels. Personally, I did it hoping to see the fair price as soon as possible. Time will say if I did a right choice..."
2021-04-25 10:20:05,stocks,"BABA is a really great company with an amazing culture. I had the pleasure of working with a subsidiary on a consulting basis and it was an absolute pleasure. 

It’s really easy to look at BABA’s performance and draw the conclusion it’s a $500 stock. 

That being said, the CCP is pissed off at their founder and the CCP directs the show. They’ve chosen others to play the lead roles in said show. BABA will be facing a major headwind for the remainder of its days."
2021-04-25 10:06:19,stocks,"Baba severely discounted right now across various valuation metrics.. unbelievably cheap actually, compared with how everything else is priced..there is a political, regulation storm people are waiting to pass, and rightfully so.. the ANT IPO is what legitimized it in near term to $300+.. that IPO is not nearly what it once was going to be and elements have been so severely whacked by China regulators.. I see China equities being more of a risk as time develops rather than storm passing, just my opinion and hate to be bias towards negative... additionally, I do know China is pushing de leveraging of their system so might want to wait for that whole thing to shake out.. check out KWEB on a six month look back and look into why emerging markets are underperforming, in general."
2021-04-25 12:31:56,stocks,You're not really long if you watch the price every day. Forget about it and check in the next 2 or 3 years minimum
2021-04-25 14:56:40,stocks,"BABA is giving long term investors the ultimate opportunity to buy in or average down. CCP anti-competitive investigation over, small fine levied, stock at a great price. What's the next bad news for BABA? I don't see anything on the horizon, load up"
2021-04-25 15:07:24,stocks,Bro if you’re this pissed about it being cheap then you shouldn’t hold it. Buy more lol
2021-04-25 16:21:48,stocks,"I've been holding since 290$, hold on, you'll be fine!"
2021-04-25 19:18:14,stocks,"Going to be pedantic, but 'my frustration is not abiding' doesn't make sense. Maybe you meant 'but my frustration is not abating.'"
2021-04-25 09:12:49,stocks,"Baba is taking it hard from the government. I think it’ll be fine. But the waters need to clear. The US exchange would want to keep Baba but China has plans of its own. 

I’m also long Baba on calls and share. I believe but we need more clarity. We need Xi to fucking chill and let’s China’s big dogs eat!"
2021-04-25 10:02:25,stocks,"I am 90% on BABA right now, trust me and hold. At least 320+ EOY. Market can remain irrational longer than you think."
2021-04-25 09:32:26,stocks,No it’s a beast and will most likely bounce back at least based on business operations. Government intervention could affect things but I think that’s been overblown. Your options could be dicey depending on the timeframe but I think the evaluation will follow the earnings over time.
2021-04-25 19:41:43,stocks,"Are all Americans heavily indoctrinated by their media?
All of the criticism about baba I have seen is about “communist China” or “delisting threats” lmao.

China was supposed to be the country that controls their citizens, not the us"
2021-04-25 08:44:45,stocks,Wait till earnings
2021-04-25 09:56:26,stocks,If you look at the baba umbrella the potential is limitless
2021-04-25 10:24:23,stocks,"If you have full faith, conviction and believe that relations between China and the US will eventually mend, then now is the time to accumulate shares. 

Could either make you a very rich person down the road or a very poor one. Good luck!"
2021-04-25 19:38:22,stocks,Just remember you don't actually own stock in the company.
2021-04-25 16:09:34,stocks,"I'm bullish on E-commerce, but not in a company where the ~~CEO~~ _founder & chairman_ will get kidnapped by his government, and blocked his Alipay IPO.

Plenty of other E-commerce companies to invest in.

If China ever starts these same kind of shenanigans with NIO, I'm selling my NIO shares too then

Bull-case thesis becomes compromised when the top executive can no longer innovate and has to tiptoe around broken glass. Too many other investing opportunities for me to deal with that nonsense."
2021-04-25 10:15:28,stocks,I recently bought into BABA for a large portion of my portfolio because it's inevitable.
2021-04-25 10:59:33,stocks,"As someone who had a 3-4 year abusive relationship with baba, just set your expectations beneath the floor"
2021-04-25 11:49:46,stocks,Yea I’m feeling the same frustration. I bought in around 270 and bought a couple more at 227 to bring my cost average down to around 260. I’m not going to give up the stock for at least 2-3 more quarters. It’s not down on fundamentals it’s down bc CHYNAAA 🤷🏿‍♂️
2021-04-25 13:54:44,stocks,"I've been holding since 2015.  Been doing well.  It's only the lots I picked up last year thats been underperforming.

I have not stopped using Aliexpress or Alipay when the opportunity arises.

I'm not seeing the problem.

The US China tension will blow over once most people in the US figure out China is the solution, not the problem.

Just go to wait out the Pres. Boomer and his little cold war."
2021-04-25 11:16:00,stocks,"As per Blackrock, global investors are underinvested in China. I advise that you buy the dip on BABA, JD, and BIDU until they’re 10% of your portfolio."
2021-04-25 11:26:02,stocks,"Can I ask a legitimate question here to all the bulls / investors?  Whereas big tech stocks in the US have all instituted dividends (Apple) or buybacks (many others), we have not seen this at all in China.  Sure, China is earlier in growth and thus sees better ROIC on their investments in growth than buying their own shares, but let’s fast forward a few years (even 10 if that makes you happy since we’ll be beaming in our buy/sell orders from the moon thanks to Elon).  Does anyone here legitimately think that the Chinese government would allow Alibaba, Tencent, Meituan, etc. to ever take money out of China and use it to pay shareholders who are predominantly overseas (via dividends or share buybacks)?  If not, what endgame are we all playing for or are we betting on price action?"
2021-04-25 08:56:29,stocks,Sure bet but timing is not certain. BABA needs Amazon type valuation.
2021-04-25 12:22:07,stocks,"It won’t, Chinese govt flexing their powers, doubt baba will ever get back to pre-ma power in China, will always be a power in China but not as strong"
2021-04-25 13:25:10,stocks,"Watch the documentary called:

2021-04-25 14:49:58,stocks,I was a BABA holder as well. It has taken grenade after grenade from the CCP. Was tired of watching and waiting for the negative news to stop so I sold as soon as it came back to even for me. I don’t think it gets delisted in the near future but I don’t want any part of any Chinese company’s stock for the foreseeable future.
2021-04-25 15:48:21,stocks,I ain't touching it.
2021-04-25 16:02:05,stocks,I remember being on the BABA train years ago. Was not a fun ride and $VOO looks like a billion times more attractive. I didn't sleep well at night holding $BABA
2021-04-25 16:17:10,stocks,All Chinese stocks are a bit risky right
2021-04-25 13:27:44,stocks,"Might end when they get delisted, and you can finally get closure. Might not.

I like Alibaba but I’d never buy BABA, because you’re not buying The actual company, you’re buying a Cayman Islands company which owns a Chinese holding company with a contract to some of Alibaba’s profits."
2021-04-25 16:38:51,stocks,"Get out of Chinese garbage man!

What BABA does is great, and if you owned part of the company like most stocks would be valuable. However, even though public, the company is a China property.  They can change the rules and nationalize at any moment with no payout to you.  If not for the CCP I would be super bullish on Chinese stocks.  However as long as they linger over them they are all fool's gold."
2021-04-25 11:39:57,stocks,"300+ isn’t going to happen. That being said BABA and China companies are only going up. The basic economic indicators are completely in BABA’s favor and the trade war has really clouded western investors judgement, who already overhype the “evil autocratic commies are going to intentionally destroy there own economy.” As a long time BABA, it’s only going up from here."
2021-04-25 13:43:36,stocks,The stock is certainly worth more but the geopolitical risks are definitely scary. Hope your risk pays off big time💰
2021-04-25 14:27:36,stocks,"I don't understand why people invest in company stock located half a world away, when you don't live there or aren't very familiar with the place.

I know people abroad invest in US stocks, I guess I get it, but damn. China has a bright future if handled correctly but I don't see why this decade is going to be ""it."" 

If you invested in what will eventually be the most successful company in, say, the African continent, in 20 years, why wouldn't you think there would be frustrations in the meantime even if your convictions were high?"
2021-04-25 15:07:45,stocks,"There’s still too much political instability. Plus, all that you “own” is shares in a Cayman Islands shell company, not the actual company. The audits aren’t reviewed by the PCAOB, either."

2021-04-25 13:22:59,stocks, chill out an have a coffee. If you look back at BABAs history the last time it had a major dip it lasted like two years and went down like 35%. This is a long term multi-year play you need diamond hands for BABA. It will pay off you are patient. Nothing is a “too good to be true” offer
2021-04-25 14:08:18,stocks,So i have 220calls right now. I am thinking about making it a spread so I don't get fucked by theta. The calls expire on september 17. Do you think I should sell the 260 270 or 280s?

2021-04-25 16:15:44,stocks,"I have done heavy DD in baba and have taken a large stake in it at exactly 220$ level. That is a critical support at a multi year trend line. Baba is significantly undervalued and would be a 400$ stock if given the USA premium. Many funds do not want to go into baba do the the uncertainty (and want instant gains for their quarter) but are moving back into it recently. It will not move significantly to your 300$ price target until the ANT ipo goes through sometime this year no matter how good the core business is. ANT ipo is the key that shows investors that China has gotten their foot off them to allow for smooth sailings. For those saying increased competition, yes that is true but baba is such a significant preference for many sellers that it wouldn’t hurt their bottom line. In addition, the anti monopoly law now allows their services on weechat through tabaoo deals. I haven’t even mentioned their growing cloud business at 4% global market share that is not even factored into their stock price much at all. Do your own research. Again the 220$ is critical and has had many bounces. I know it’s frustrating but long term you will be paid off well. Short term it’s a pain in the ass seeing some positive news followed by “CCP ant, Jack ma xyz”"

2021-04-25 08:45:24,stocks,I miss 2020 prices.
2021-04-25 09:16:24,stocks,"For an index it’s pretty unlikely, but a lot of individual stocks are pretty volatile. In fact it would be very unusual if a stock like alibaba didn’t see a 30% difference between its high and its low within any 12 month period. Obviously it could go down just as easily as it could go up, so you can’t rely on it going up in a short amount on time, but it’s definitely not unrealistic. Consistently making 30% a year is unrealistic, but individual stocks often fluctuate that much."
2021-04-25 12:46:03,stocks,"He’s not trying to make an easy 30% here. He’s just expecting that a deeply undervalued company grows back up to fair value. And that can’t be measured in the percentage points it needs to go up by because 30% after it still won’t be an over valued stock. Forget FAANG, they’re American behemoths so they get to trade at a premium but Baba is undervalued even when compared to JD, Pinduoduo, Baidu and Tencent. That in my opinion is why there’s deep value in Baba and when the skies clear up, it will shoot up quickly to its fair value."
2021-04-25 08:50:10,stocks,"Yea, i hear you on a traditional ROI point of view, i'm looking for a return to prior valuations, maybe naively."
2021-04-25 13:32:28,stocks,It’s realistic if the stock is selling at a discount for specific reasons. I’ll let you decide whether or not you think it’s selling at a discount currently.
2021-04-25 11:50:03,stocks,In general you might be right but any decent valuation has BABA $300+ right now.   Very specific factors are keeping it down due to uncertainty. Once the uncertainty is lifted a stock can rise dramatically in short time.  I have no problem believing it can be 300 by end of year.
2021-04-25 11:41:44,stocks,This. Everyone seems to think every stock should double all of sudden.  Ridiculous expectations.

2021-04-25 12:48:55,stocks,"You are looking at the average of the consensus, which means if a couple of analysts put a big price target of $500, it will pull the average up.

2021-04-25 12:05:00,stocks,I have seen several “sum of the parts” valuations that have BABA share price well over $300 jist with their core e-commerce and cloud businesses. Everything else like Ant (fintech) not even included.
2021-04-25 19:25:57,stocks,"Yes,  I noticed also role vs roll, afterward, chose not to edit"
2021-04-25 09:44:44,stocks,"They settled with a slap on the wrist. That’s all it’s ever going to be. Baba is too important to China for Xi to cripple them. He just needs to save face. Same song and dance with US Congress and big tech. Obviously there are differences in the culture, but both governments know the value that these companies provide in a globally competitive market.

Capitalism is a drug and once you’re on the drip, you cannot get off without bloodshed and revolution. China isn’t doing that again anytime soon. 

I sleep well at night holding BABA. It’s probably the most undervalued company on the NYSE. Until big US investors start abandoning ship, I’m going to hold. Blackrock, Vanguard, and TRowe Price own over 35B worth of this stock."

2021-04-25 14:39:00,stocks,"Alright, this will be far from a comprehensive take but a few details/anecdotes should make the point pretty clear.

Mango supporters often believe that all criticism of his foreign policy is that its too hawkish and aggressive. But its not even an issue of what grand strategy he was attempting to execute because there simply wasn't one. There was no coherent ""trump doctrine"", just geopolitical button-mashing with nearly zero positive outcomes. A boxer who chooses to swing wildly at the turnbuckle in the neutral corner while getting their ass beat by a well-prepared opponent isn't having a bad fight because they chose to be too aggressive, they simply don't know what the fuck they're doing.

I'm not going to cite some of this stuff so feel free to fact check. If you want to save time, don't bother. I'm not bullshitting.

At the very beginning of 2017, many in security/intelligence/military circles were leery of sharing much intel at all with Donnie as they were sure he'd flip it to the Russians. But they last straw was in May of 2017 when he blabbed about the locations of nuclear submarines to [FUCKING DUTERTE](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-submarines/trump-calls-north-korea-leader-madman-who-cannot-be-let-on-the-loose-transcript-idUSKBN18K15Y) of all fucking people. Nuclear warfighting/strategy is driven by calculations to the second of how quickly one can respond to a nuclear threat and counter-strike and/or destroy an opponents second-strike capability. The whole fucking point of heavily loaded nuclear subs that can stay out at sea indefinitely and are first/second strike weapons is *ambiguity*. It never makes sense to first-strike a country whose nuclear subs could be anywhere. The US has 14. Disclosing where 2 of them are just because you felt like it inherently destabilizing in a way that complicates (at a minimum) the balance of MAAD. This was a rocket kick at the US's goal for no fucking reason at all. And the Joint Chiefs, CIA, NSA, they were all done with his ass after that. Fortunately all his briefings had to be [in picture form](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-looks-at-charts-in-intelligence-briefings-2020-5) and fit on 1 sheet of paper so it wasn't hard to not tell him anything important.

Ah gawd, this is already way too long. Here's some more funny stories real quick:

Donnie almost pulled the US out of the South Korean Free Trade Agreement on a whim one day. John Kelly snaked the piece of paper off of his desk and Donnie didn't notice. Did Donnie get mad the next day when his plan to blow-up the economic component of one of the US's most critical alliances in the pacific didn't happen? Nope. He forgot. So everyone just moved-on.

Donnie pissed and shat all over many of our alliances, but Australia, Japan, South Korea, and NATO were probably some of the most moronic own-goal type zero-upside shittings. Asking NATO members for $ was fucking stupid when Russia is clearly the most potentially aggressive adversaries in the region. Same with withdrawing missile defense tech from the ROK for no reason with no concession (it wasn't there for the North Korea fyi). Read the transcript of his call with the PM of Australia about the boat refugees and tell me Donnie's IQ is 3 digits.

His foreign policy was damage control done by John Kelly (until he quit to become the CEO of the baby jailing company that had been banking \~$740 a day/kid on the border). And then John Bolton (whose damage control amounted to 15 sneaky things done to try to trick Donnie into going to war with Iran...which ultimately Putin wouldn't allow Donnie to do). After Bolton quit, it was literally asleep-at-the-wheel foreign policy for several months.

Those months coincided with the time that the PRC was likely finishing negotiations of the RCEP. Its not an accident that they inked the thing just a few days after the Biden election was conclusive. RCEP was a brilliantly timed geopolitical execution by China to lock-in a tremendous soft-power advantage throughout the Pacific (including Latin America when you get down to it) that was created by the vacuous and mis-managed years of the dumbass donnie doctrine.

ok that's enough for now. its beer 30."

2021-04-25 19:47:23,stocks,"Sweet take 😂

I've been bullish on BABA for a while now but RCEP is new information to me. I have no doubt China is going to aggressively expand into those markets, and I have no doubt about the growth potential for Chinese E-Commerce. The question to me is who to bet on?

BABA seems to be a no brainer. Huge network effect, richly diversified, not going anywhere. Plus Charlie Munger recently started a position – which alone might be enough to convince me. 

The only thing is I'm wondering whether its huge moat becomes a risk in the context of CCP's anti-monopoly agenda. In other words, whether a smaller, faster growing competitor offer better risk/reward (i.e. JD, PDD)."
2021-04-25 17:16:13,stocks,Thanks for this info. I’ve had 11 shares for 3 years at $161 basis. I wish I bought more over the years because I’ve always been bullish but can’t go back now. I’ve been debating recently buying a LEAPS or just slowly accumulating a few shares here and there.

No, it isn't. You're thinking of America. Redditors and China hawks will read three sentences of the IMDB or Wikipedia summary for The China Hustle and come away with this conclusion, but if you actually had a brain and watched the documentary you'd realize it's pretty much entirely the fault of American firms and American regulators. Every example cited in The China Hustle is about how *American* accounting firms would cook the books for shoddy Chinese firms in order to get them listed on the NYSE and thus profit off of American retail investors who think China is the ""next big thing"" and will blindly throw their money at anything and everything China related. The actual Chinese firm is rarely or never guilty of any actual malfeasance, and the Chinese government doesn't even enter into this equation at all. American accounting firms use loopholes in American regulations to scam American retail investors, but somehow Gyna Bad.

Oh, and these aren't third rate accounting firms. They're Deloitte and PWC and KPG etc. For the privilege of cooking the books, all the lawyers and underwriters and accountants get paid handsomely, and when the truth comes out they are not punished by American laws whatsoever. It's a great hustle, actually, though it isn't China perpetrating or benefiting from it.

As far as the Chinese government is concerned, these very same companies report honest books back home, in China, because unlike the SEC Beijing actually does its job and will *literally* execute fraudsters. Yes, China is one of the few countries in the world that applies the death penalty to white collar criminals. You can think this is inhumane or whatever (lol) but you cannot accuse them of turning a blind eye to financial crimes.

In fact, that this happens with Chinese companies is purely incidental. If tomorrow retail investors started thinking Czech or Nigerian companies were the next big thing, they would be targeted by the same scam, but with Czech or Nigerian companies instead.

I don't know how many more financial crises Americans have to live through before they realize their enemies are on Wall Street and in Washington, not in Beijing."

2021-04-25 00:00:00,stocks,"VTI vs VOO - they are almost the same. I have seen several posts about these two indices and people often say that VTI is a better bet because it is so much more diversified. Well... yes and no. 

VOO has around 500 companies and tracks S&P 500 index. 

VTI has around 3,500 companies and tracks CRSP US Total Market index. 

So yes, 3,500 companies vs 500 is more diversified. However both these indices are market weighted. Which means that the larger the company the more allocation it has in the index. Because of that, and because how giant S&P 500 companies are in comparison to the other 3,000 smaller companies, 95% of VTI is S&P 500. So 95% of VTI is VOO.  Check out their historical performance - very close. I wish I could paste a graph here. 

So their performance is almost identical. VOO has a slightly higher dividend yield. Fee is the same - 3bps. 

Funny thing is that although VTI is more diversified, it has slightly higher historical volatility.

At the end - either fund is fine. However if you truly want to have non-S&P exposure, you should add VXF (or maybe VO) as a complement to VOO. 

Also, VTI is total US market. No international exposure. So VXUS might be a good companion as well if you want some outside of US exposure."
2021-04-25 09:48:53,stocks,"Tell you what, just buy VT and call it a day. Go out and enjoy your weekend."
2021-04-25 12:33:30,stocks,"I'm going to disagree here and say that VTI is actually a lot better than VOO, and also that any total market fund is better than the S&P500. A couple of important reasons: factor investing and front running. TLDR, but VTI, buy some VXF, get rid of VOO.

First, factor investing, Small caps over time perform better than large caps because of their higher risk premium and the company's size and maturity. Since VTI has small cap exposure, there is should be slightly higher risk, but also higher returns. In recent years, the performance of VOO has outpaced VTI because small caps have actually underperformed due to the rise of large cap tech, but this is not the case historically or from a risk premium standpoint. You can see this if you include periods of small cap outperformance for example between 2003 and 2007. If you include this period, SPY went up 391% and VTI went up 449%, excluding dividends.

Second, front running. Some people might not know that the S&P500 does not actually hold the 500 largest companies in the US. VTI and total market indices actually hold many companies that have larger market cap than many of the s&P500 companies. For example Square (SQ), a favorite around here, has a market cap of 112 billion, or around the market cap of Intuit (INTU), the 76th largest companies in the S&P500. The reason for this is that the S&P500 index itself is not exactly passive but have requirements of market cap, longevity, profitability and quality as well. Why is this important? because since the index changes continuously, you would know when a company will be included or excluded. Since so much money is invested in the S&P500, you would also know that when some company has been included, there would be a ton of forced buying from those passive index funds. And if you know that there will be a lot of buying of the stock on a certain date, investors can and will front run this buying by increasing the stock price and pulling out after the passive indexers have been forced to buy in. The perfect example here is Tesla. It was not in the S&P500 despite having a huge market cap because of profitability concerns. When it was announced that Tesla would be included, the price shot up quickly in January, leading passive S&P500 index investors to not only miss out on this performance but overpay when front runners have finished buying. You can see this in VXF, which holds stocks that are NOT in the S&P500, so Tesla was in VXF but not anymore, and SQ is in VXF. During the same period from 2003, VXF went up 660%, excluding dividends, way better than both VTI and VOO, due to both size factor and lack of front running drag.

Edit: I would like to mention though that despite the outperformance of VXF over many years, I would still be careful going all in because small caps tend to have long periods of consolidation and larger corrections with periods of massive booms. After the recent small cap outperformance, I would be careful not to chase performance."
2021-04-25 16:35:50,stocks,"VOO is roughly 82% of VTI. The other 18% is small and mid caps, which we would expect to be more volatile. We would also expect those smaller stocks to outperform large stocks, and indeed they have historically."
2021-04-25 12:26:06,stocks,"VTI is more volatile because VOO is biased towards less-volatile tickers. VTI only adds companies to VOO, and they're significantly more volatile by nature.

VTI is closer to an index than VDO.  

You can mimic behavior in the market, or even in a sector, with a smaller basic.  This is what we call sampling, this is what a case study in psychology tries to do.  

But when you're trying to predict the behavior (or better yet, benefit from it) then you're better going off the entire index (e.g. VTI) and SPY or DJI.  

An index should cover the majority of your investments - nothing is going to beat it in the long run.  If you think that a smaller basket of stocks is a better investment, then why not reduce it to an absurdity:  one.  

Pick the one stock that you think is going to do better than the index, and just invest in it.  This might be the GOOG, TSLA or AAPL all of which offers exposure to a broader range of risks (and benefits) including FOREX.  Even MMM does just that, but across materials.  

Anyhow, the index investment should be at the fore.  VTI is hence better than VDO in doing just that."

2021-04-25 17:43:52,stocks,"&#x200B;

Size is basically the weakest factor (liquidity is also a shitty factor IMO)

Size has been really weak since its discovery

Small differences in how you measure size make or break the factor (and don't for value, momentum, profitability)

Size doesn't work in all markets, unlike value, momentum, profitability etc.

Size is dominated by the January effect (which may just be an error in the CRSP database)

Size doesn't work in other asset classes (bonds, currencies, etc.) unlike value and momentum

Size comes from microcpas, which are difficult to trade

Size is difficult to trade

There is no ""story"" (ex-liquidity) that explains size

Small caps trade less, which artificially smoothes their returns, when desmoothed, the size effect looks a lot like beta

Buuuuuuut

Other anomalies are stronger in small stocks

Size comes back when you kick out the unprofitable small-cap growth stocks that drag all small caps down with their crappy performance

Solution: SCV (AVUV, DFSVX or IJS/VIOV if you don't like active funds) or DFSTX for pure small exposure or an integration multifactor strategy that targets size"

Can you please link that article? Foreign taxes paid should be reported on Line 7 of the 1099 regardless of your international ownership percentage. In any case, foreign taxes paid probably would not be reported to you since technically you don't own the shares, the ETF issuer does.

2021-04-25 13:23:25,stocks,"Yes you would be ""double dipping"" but what you're really doing is overweight smaller cap companies and trying to capture the higher risk premium. Also keep in mind that double dipping doesn't matter too much because of the small market cap. If you believe in a smaller company, you can be triple dipping, quadruple, 10x weighting, etc. and still have a very small exposure compared to large cap companies. Something like VXF and VTI lets you invest in companies that grow from very low market caps to maturity and capture all of the returns there, but VOO starts from a very high base in the billions of market cap, even without front running problems. On average, there would be less upside from there."

2021-04-25 12:30:56,stocks,"Regarding the 50% rule per IRC Sec.853 I was able to find this [ELI5.](https://answerconnect.cch.com/document/arp286529a0d47b6c100085a1001b7840a5b20b3COPY/federal/irc/explanation/853-foreign-tax-credit)

Basically, IRC.853 is divided into 6 subsections. Subsection A allows a Regulated Investment Company, such as Vanguard, the option to elect to transfer its Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) to its shareholders rather than to take it on the company's own tax return. However, this election can only be made if 50% of the assets are held in foreign corporations and Vanguard distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to the shareholders. If one of the criteria is not met, Vanguard is required to take the FTC deduction on its own tax return. 

Subsection B is the effect of the election. Naturally, only one taxable entity can take the FTC deduction. Either Vanguard takes the deduction directly and reduces the taxable income that distributes to its shareholders, or it passes the credit to its shareholders and does not take a deduction. 

Subsection C is to let you know that if Vanguard has made the election to pass the FTC along to its shareholders, the company must also provide you with a statement detailing your deduction and you should not report to the IRS a deduction greater than the one reported on this statement.

Subsections D to subsections F are not really applicable to you so I won't spend time on it.

In plain English, Sec.853 is let you know that if Vanguard meets both criteria outlined in subsection A, the Regulated Investment Company has the option to pass along the FTC deduction rather than take it themselves. It does not mean that VT will not give you a FTC deduction because less than 50% of its assets are foreign corporations, but rather, the FTC deduction is already embedded in the distributions made to you. This is kinda what I was thinking in my original post above.

The second link that you posted lets you know which [Vanguard funds qualified](https://advisors.vanguard.com/iwe/pdf/taxcenter/FASFTCWS_012021.pdf) for the Sec.853 election. You will note that VT is not there; but VXUS is. The decision between VT or VTI+VXUS is more of personal preference than taxability issues. Some people will point out that holding VTI+VXUS has a lower expense ratio than VT by itself but I mean....you're talking pennies here for each thousand dollars invested. 

The only benefit of holding VXUS separate, rather than through VT, would be if you had other foreign investments or equities and you wanted to use the FTC credit from Vanguard to offset those investments. This is a little bit more complex and outside my scope since you would need to file Form 1116 with your return. This is more of a tax planning issue for a CPA with International Tax background rather than for Reddit to answer lol.

>I also think their international allocation changes so some years it is a bit under 50% and others it is over? 

Yea this thing changes all the time. During the last 2 decades, US equities have performed exceptionally well compared to foreign investments so the share of US market cap has increased. It fluctuates all the time so I wouldn't worry too much about it."

BE's stock has gotten a bunch of recent price upgrades, so maybe others are starting to come around.

I'm also still bullish on NEE, but the fact that they lost so much revenue in Q1 from those TX storms makes me concerned that they need to do a bit more winterizing as well.

Of course if you get some subsidized land, it's going to be cheaper to install lots of rows of panels in a few weeks instead of sending a crew to a different house every other day.

But connecting those solar farms to the grid is a bottleneck and homes are already connected to the grid. Homes also have free rooftops, without requiring subsidies or other costs.

For many places, once the grid costs and the land costs are included, home solar is cheaper even if install costs are higher. Of course, if you have a plot of free land next to the grid, then that's going to be cheapest.

It's the same with nuclear. Once you include total system cost and complexity, nuclear (at Korean, not European or American, prices) is very competitive. A recent study for the Netherlands found that a 30% nuclear component would make our transition much more affordable, even if the kWh price is significantly higher than wind or solar."

I checked their website and they're hiring left and right. About 1500 employees already and they're growing rapidly. Current market cap is around $10B which is 1/6th of Ford and 1/60th of Tesla.

Company looks pretty solid. Currently trading under ARVL. Any thoughts?

NYTimes recently wrote about it: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/business/arrival-electric-vehicles.html"
2021-04-25 03:17:15,stocks,"SPAC with an order book of 1.2B, expecting revenue to reach 14.1B by 2024.  That is one hell of a tough hill to climb.

Microfactories are neat and innovative, but because they are micro they cannot vertically integrate fully I am assuming.  This will put some pressure on margins, but they will benefit on margins as well from their in house tech.

I don't see anything particularly innovative about their vehicles, most of their expertise seems to be manufacturing related, but will have to be proven at steady state.  Would be cool to see them team up with a major manufacturer as a provider of manufacturing tech.

I would wait on this one and watch it.  Last mile delivery is a competitive space, buses also.  They need to be able to offer a product with automation features, which seem to be coming from Waymo potentially, who could just as easily partner with their competitors on any fleet tenders.

https://www.autoblog.com/2020/01/29/ups-deliveries-arrival-vans-waymo/

I would need to start see their order book build with other clients, otherwise they might not succeed.  Amazon went with Rivian.  USPS  went with Oshkosh.  

I don't know enough about their product to say why they didn't get those contracts, but I feel like maybe they're missing something... who knows, maybe they've got something in the works.  Lazy me says that a 130kwh battery for their vans that only produces 160km of range is not efficient or leading edge tech, but I didn't dig into the load assumptions, nor the driving conditions used to come up with that figure.

Considering that they're trading for almost 8x their booked revenues and haven't actually produced en masse yet, this is pretty high risk.

Please feel free to correct any of the above.  I am neither long nor short this stock.  If you can tell me why their product is better than their competitors, I will do some further DD."
2021-04-25 08:24:43,stocks,"I worked on the design team in Coventry. It was all engineered by third party automotive firms in Coventry all ex JLR guys, the concept being based around what a company called Local Motors did a few years ago who I also worked for and they were rolling in money fast, I think the micro factory system has legs.

The vehicle is basically designed to be a knock down kit you can screw together by hand, it’s all rotation molded parts around a chassis made of extrusions so it’s easy to ship and parts can be made by third parties anywhere in the world on the cheap which makes expansion much easier. I would say out of all these speculative ev startups this is the one to watch."
2021-04-25 02:46:27,stocks,I have a few shares which i held since their listing. Initially went down in price but averaged down and the stock had a good climb at the end of last week and i am now 6% up. They have backing of ups and when they actually start delivering products I’m expecting a good rise. They are pioneering new technology in build and production which is as yet untested so hopefully they don’t have any big teething issues.
2021-04-25 03:12:40,stocks,"I’ve been keeping an eye on this one, I originally assumed they’d be a typical Tesla challenger but they’re claiming to be the opposite. Their focus is on the commercial EV market, vans and buses etc. Interesting play to be honest, now they have the 660 million to invest, it could be a good opportunity to buy. Will defo evaluate my free cash Monday."

2021-04-25 17:12:42,stocks,"love their idea, love that their vertically integrated and I love that they have a lot more buisness prospects than just EV. I'm going to hold on a very small amount of shares, and once we see an actually working product and the utilization of micro factories i'll buy many more"
2021-04-25 07:56:29,stocks,"They didn't bid on usps deal.

Otherwise I agree on risks

They design own compounds for more vertical Integration

I see it more as a software company enabling the microfactories, licensing that out to people looking to mass produce with low overhead or lower quantity. Like an AWS of car building. Rent space/process time."

2021-04-25 12:08:58,stocks,I bought Thursday after NYT article.  Also like LUCID /(CC/IV)
2021-04-25 12:05:17,stocks,Did you read the article? They build mini factories at a very low cost . They are planning or already have some in the US. Probably easy to open in Europe too
2021-04-25 12:42:33,stocks,Why do you say that?
2021-04-25 11:23:15,stocks,"Im definitely not convinced about their microfactory approach. There is a reason why auto companies have consolidated production into giant factories for literally over a hundred years. Sure the technology under the car may have significantly changed, but at a fundamental level its still a metal box with 4 wheels. 

The benefits of economies of scale and driving marginal cost down through streamlining production are significantly higher than any benefit that Arrival may hope to get from localizing deliveries, especially when legacy automakers jump into the electric van game with their existing factories and distribution network of dealerships. When a company like Nissan with their already released eNV200, or Ford with their 2022 electric transit, and Dodge, Mercedes, and Tesla come out with their electric vans, Arrival will only have started production, and at such small numbers that it might not make much of a difference. 

And honestly the market is inevitably heading in a similar direction to the smartphone industry, where componentization of parts will make it so that any company can put together their own EV from off the shelf parts. Pick a drivetrain and battery pack, have a frame designed, pick out the software, and add your own spin. Sony showed this off with their Vision S. In a way its not too different than how cars are already made, sharing platforms and parts bins from different vehicles and even across different brands. So Arrival would then not only be competing with legacy automakers, but also dozens of other startups or existing companies that enter the car market."
2021-04-25 12:55:04,stocks,"I don't think the market sees it that way yet.  Nor do I, until they proof out their capabilities.  I might miss this one, but see a high probability that it trades lower before they establish their niche."

2021-04-25 13:33:22,stocks,"I saw that comment but I'm still not convinced. Even if Arrival were to sell their own DIY EV van kits, there will be other companies who offer the same thing but to other EV companies, who will then sell customers their own polished and completed products and can walk in and drive them off the lot within 2 hours, or have it delivered to them. And those companies will be able to get their costs down because they centralize their resources and production to lower their marginal cost, so they would then have an advantage over arrival in having lower price to sell more units, or higher profit to invest more in increasing sales or further design / development."
2021-04-25 13:53:12,stocks,We'll see. A ton of competition.  Financial Times analyst says out of 12 EV SPACS only one that can compete with TSLA is LUCID. Recent reports refer to their production facility as impressive

Go with VT and keep buying until you have a nice sized position (whatever that means to you). Then branch out into different sectors or individual companies... You're not going to go wrong with VT but you won't have exceptional returns either."

If you had a decent amount of upfront capital, would you invest sizable amount of that up front right now, or just set a drip on that specific amount (ie something like $100 per week until $10,000 was burned through)?

I’d imagine there’s a higher risk investing a large sum now as opposed to investing over time, and you’d perhaps be able to buy a dip with remaining capital?"

2021-04-25 11:11:14,stocks,"This is why you just get in... set an amount, buy every month or whatever. Buy the lows, buy the highs. Important thing is to follow it. You’ll end up with an accumulation of positions. Some you bought high, some you bought low. Average position price will eventually be solid and you’d be happy you did it. 

Again. This is advice that is sound but I did not follow it. The FOMO is a tough devil to beat. I’m telling you from experience in which I sold and entered something else. 

But when I look back at it and calculate, I was better off holding and just adding to the position."
2021-04-25 05:17:55,stocks,"Funny. Was just having that conversation with someone about BRK-B... love the grow, especially if you buy the dips, as Buffet always comes back. Just don’t like that while portfolio is filled with dividend paying positions, they do not pay a dividend. 

Therefore, if I had to choose one to be in and have a relative piece of mind about capturing the entire market. I’d choose VTI. 

Funny thing is that while I know that’s sound advice... I personally don’t really take it."
2021-04-25 10:45:51,stocks,"Interestingly, lump sum investing (all at once) on average beats DCA ($100 every week), even when invested at theoretically the worst time (market highs). Truly shows time in the market beats timing the market."

2021-04-25 10:30:33,stocks,"It will be interesting to see the direction in which BRK-B goes post-Buffet. I think the dip may be notable, but the stock will come back as its fundamentals are strong. In the future we may see dividends, a continuation of the current philosophy or a drastic change from the past with a new direction (this would probably be the worst overall outcome)."
2021-04-25 11:07:15,stocks,Good question
2021-04-25 11:05:33,stocks,"Based on historical trends yes. That is assuming it is held for a long time, something like 20+ years."
2021-04-25 11:08:51,stocks,"My plan is to hold and keep adding to the portfolio. I want to keep it small so it’s not too hard to manage. VTI will be majority of what I buy tomorrow, but would you recommend anything else?"
2021-04-25 11:16:12,stocks,"VTI is very good. Index funds will likely outpace any individual stock you (or I) pick. With that said I have around 60% VTI but also other picks I’m confident in like MSFT and DIS, and CNRG. If you want less risk down the line you can look into adding bonds into your portfolio as you approach retirement. You don’t want to have to deal with a potential crash potentially halving your portfolio when you may need your money to retire. Best of luck to you!"
2021-04-25 11:20:17,stocks,"There will never be a right answer. Hindsight is 20/20. However, through the long lenses of time, historically the large buy in now is usually the best option. But I would always say do what you are comfortable with and put yourself in an opportunity to win long term. 

You may start with 1000$. With the plan to buy 500$ a month for the next 12 months. But how about on month 3 for example, the stock takes a 5% crawl back? Maybe then you could buy 1000$ that month? 

You will always have options with that and your comfort level will be better which will probably make it easier than just watching your 10k investment from a distance feeling powerless when the eventual down times come. They will come, but remember, history shows those that wait it out and keep at it. Do so much more than those that tinker with individual stocks. I can’t tell you how many times I left a position after a downturn to only see it run months or years later. Sticking to a plan is always best. 

Remember to set it to DRIP as this has you buying the dividends they pay out to buy more shares. It’s small, but it compounds your investment over time. It’s really the only way to accumulate wealth when your out side of the 1 percent, being an athlete, or the next Bill Gates."
2021-04-25 11:23:53,stocks,"This is really good advice, thank you! I’m only 21 and relatively new to investing (started around ago when covid first hit), I want to start over though, because I discovered r/wallstreetbets and lost 90% of my original investment, lol. That’s why I’m going the long route on this- also have money going into a roth ira every month"
2021-04-25 12:55:30,stocks,"There is a weird stat about how 90 percent of investors lose 90 percent when they first invest. 

21 is a great age. Wish I did something like that. I’m 39... have had a 401k since I was 24, but didn’t really start investing on my own till 35 or so. 

Built a small portfolio out of scraps and I’m happy with it. Obviously with a lot of mistakes in the beginning. 

Low steady and slow, especially as early as 21 will make life much easier when you’re 39. 

Don’t think of it so much as early retirement as in America and Capitalism makes that almost impossible. Think of it that by the time you’re 40. Maybe earlier. You could start to actually do something you like for a living. Find a labor of love or some sappy BS like that. 

In the meantime. Spend money on experience not material. Invest every savings, no matter how small or trivial you think it is. 

20 years from now, when you’ve made it and the only person you work for is yourself. Hit me back up. 

Good luck."

2021-04-25 00:00:00,stocks,"Why Analyst Sees AirTags As A $10B Opportunity For Apple ""Apple unveiled its Bluetooth trackers dubbed “AirTags” on Tuesday at its “Spring Loaded” virtual event. The product represents a $10 billion opportunity for Apple, according to Raymond James & Associates.

The Apple Analyst: Raymond James analyst Chris Caso has an Outperform 2 rating on the Cupertino, California-based tech giant with a price target of $160.

The Apple Thesis: Caso said that AirTags are akin to AirPods in terms of potential growth for the Tim Cook-led company as they would strengthen its ecosystem and encourage upgrades.

“We believe this product category will have very broad appeal (who wouldn't pay $30 to not lose your wallet?), and as such could grow to become a $10 billion opportunity,” wrote Caso in a note Tuesday.

In Raymond James' estimate, AirPods sell with an annual volume of nearly 70-80 million units.

“At $30 per Air Tag (or $99 for 4), if Air Tags were to sell at a similar unit volume as AirPods, that would put annual AirTag revenue at $2 – 2.5 billion,” as per Caso.

The analyst theorized that it is reasonable that AirTags would sell at a much higher unit volume compared to AirPods as users buy multiple units to tag items such as wallets and keys.

“We wouldn’t be surprised to see AirTags grow to be a $10 billion business over time, putting that product close to AirPods in terms of revenue impact.”

Precision AirTag tracking is only available for users of iPhone 11 and above and provides an incentive for users to upgrade, according to Caso.

This month, Apple said it would let third-party companies use its “Find My” tracking network, which means third-party products can now be tracked using devices made by the Tim Cook-led company.

Anecdotally, I lost my key-fob while on a walk a while back and was fully prepared to pay ~$200 to replace it, but luckily nice people found it on the path and it was returned to me a few days later.  

But had I had this tag on it with the cool Apple logo (don't underestimate that appeal) I could've 'Detective Brown' level searched & rescued it down that path on my own...  And that's kinda cool."

Then there's the fact that this tech works with bluetooth which has issues with obstructions and is also limited to a range of 10 meters. If there's no iphone in that range, you won't find what you lost.

For the places you would want to use this in, it seems useless with this kind of price tag - there are existing cheaper alternatives that do the same thing. Also, if you want to try to use this for preventing theft...well I think the thieves might be smart enough to get rid of the tag before continuing.

I doubt that this will gain much traction."

Passers by’s phones act as an antenna of sorts for the network to pick up a particular air tags last location. You’re not actually sharing anything more than you normally share with apple by using them. And those whose phones may ping an air tag are not holding specific data on owner of the lost air tag unless specified. 

It only has to be pinged as a nearby device in range of a recent iPhone’s Bluetooth. I’m not sure there is any proper transfer of personal data.

At this point I have no faith in Fisker, Lucid, etc. They are just clones of existing EVs already available but without some of the benefits and ability to scale.

I think it's gonna be tesla, two or three traditional autos and a maybe one of the chinese companies. 

The startups are just too late which is too bad because I am definitely cheering for some like Rivian. Rivian is  my one wrench in the mix. With amazon and big auto supporting them they could make it though. Their trucks look great AND they are doing a charging network like Tesla. However, again...

So that's pretty good news for TSLA.  Interestingly enough I've recently heard TSLA is now 'cheaper' than Peleton based on analysts forward earnings projections.... but those projections also place the current price of TSLA at what it should be worth in early 2023 (current fair value of ~$435).

That's not to say break-throughs/unexpected can't push that timeline up (or down).  I'm definitely a strong believer in TSLA's future and if you're long there's probably no great harm in investing now, other than potentially sacrificing investment time in the meantime (if this projection is correct)."

VW and Renault are getting big sales in Europe, but like the Leaf, their technology isn't at a stage where they become ICE vehicle replacements for road tripping North Americans.

I like Lucid because they had industry leading efficiency numbers, at least until the Model S plaid numbers came out.  We'll see how that plays out, but the numbers are close.  Rawlinson is following the Tesla playbook, and they are years behind potentially being a major player.  The Lucid Air is a really nice car, but limited market.  I'm curious to see what they release next to increase market share and gain more mass market appeal.

Fisker, designs cars people like, but will rely on 3rd party tech.  I like the asset light model, but presales have been discouraging.  Personally, I'm not an SUV person, but also wasn't super impressed with the Ocean.

For crazy reasons, I think the long term EV winner will be Toyota.  Nobody is expecting it, but they are working towards solid state batteries, and I think with their manufacturing expertise, they might be the first to pull it off.  Their CEO is on camera talking about how EVs are a terrible idea because the Japanese grid can't handle it and the upgrades would cost so much money, but in stealth mode, they've been continuing to fund EV tech.

&#x200B;

* Belgium had the world's first stock market(without actual stocks) back in 1400's.
* The East India Company is widely recognized as the world’s first publicly traded company and the reason for them publicly traded is because of **risk**. Sailing all over the planet was too risky for any company during that time. Ships were lost, fortunes were squandered, and financiers realized they had to do something to mitigate all that risk.
* Early stock trading happened at **Coffee shops,** and stocks were hand written in paper and inventors had to trade their stocks with other investors in coffee shops.
* It was tough to make out legit companies to illegitimate companies back in the day, and in many cases companies were able to make tons of money before a single ship was ever set for sail. And because of that a bubble was burst and the government of England banned the issuing of shares until 1825.
* And despite ban of issuing shares, **London Stock Exchange** was established in 1801, it was very limited exchange because of the ban of issuing shares.
* And in 1817, **New York stock exchange** was established and it started trading since its very first day.
* And today, almost every single country has a stock market.  Every day, trillions of dollars are traded on stock markets.

Here are the top 10 stock markets in the world today ranked by market capitalization:

1. New York Stock Exchange
2. NASDAQ
3. Tokyo Stock Exchange
4. London Stock Exchange Group
5. Euronext
6. Hong Kong Stock Exchange
7. Shanghai Stock Exchange
8. Toronto Stock Exchange
9. Frankfurt Stock Exchange
10. Australian Securities Exchange"

Forgive me if I screw any of this up: EIC basically rapes and pillages India from a position of corporate colonial governance backed by the British. The resulting famine kills 33% of Bengals population (widely considered a man-made famine due to hoarding for profits).

The resulting losses for the EIC were staggering. They decided to recoup their losses from the other colonies. This leads to them shipping tea to the American colonies.

The colonies were aware of what happened to the Bengal colony when the EIC had free control. We all know what happened to that tea, and the symbolic first chapter of an independent America."

The owner made a deal with a rival master thief to divulge the location of all eleven members of this gang Who had stolen from him.  Showing great restraint but demanding they return the $160 million they had stolen from the Casino plus $38 million in interest. The eleven thieves embarked on a heist in Amsterdam to steal from a Agoraphobic recluse named Van der Woude who possessed this stock in his impenetrable safe. It would be later revealed that although the eleven thieves had successfully broken into the home to steal the first stock they had been beaten to it by the elusive international thief known  among many aliases but most notably as the The Night Fox . To this day no one knows of the final resting place of this one of a kind stock certificate. I think I read that in a WIRED article.

Why is that only the case for the NASDAQ — i.e., why don’t we commonly see indices for the NYSE or the LESG? How does the NYSE differ from the S&P or the DJI for example, do they include different subsets of stocks traded on the NYSE?

Last question — and this may help me wrap my head around this topic a little better in general — what are the actual, real-world consequences of different stock exchanges nowadays? I get that back in the day you’d need to actually *go* to the physical stock exchange to trade specific stocks, but that’s not really a thing anymore with online brokerages. So how do they play out in the real world today, is there a significant difference for me as a retail investor trading a stock that’s on the NYSE or the NASDAQ? I’m in the US, so I understand that foreign or OTC stocks usually have a commission associated with them, but how else does it play out? Other than lower volume/liquidity perhaps. 

Props to anyone that tackles these questions — thanks in advance! I’m going to look this stuff up on investopedia and see if I can wrap my mind around it.

>Belgium had the world's first stock market(without actual stocks) back in 1400's.

Which already sounds confusing. How can you have stock exchange without stocks? Since OP didn't add sources, what he means by this is speculation. In the early 14th century, Bruges was a center of trade in Europe. People would trade in the city square and stuff. In 1285 the *Ter Beurse Inn* was established. An inn run by the prominent Van der Beurse family that housed foreign merchants. The square where the inn was located was where a lot of trading was done. This is where the word beurs (bourse) comes from. The inn, square, trading together make an argument for being the first exchange, with the inn later becoming a place where solely trading was done. [More on all this here.](https://thetchblog.com/2020/09/07/the-original-bourse-at-bruges/) 

[Trade then shifted to Antwerp, where in 1531 the first purpose-built commodities exchange building was established.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourse_of_Antwerp) So that's a Belgian contender, I suppose. 

The first place where *stocks* were exchanged is [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronext_Amsterdam). In 1602. By [the Dutch East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company). You know, the company that was established in 1602 and is mentioned by OP in his second point:  


>The East India Company is widely recognized as the world’s first publicly traded company  

And then there's many more interesting contenders for world first exchanges. Ultimately it doesn't really matter which was first. It's all fascinating history worth a read. Oh, also:

The top 10 list from OP doesn't make sense to me. I was surprised the LSE had a bigger market cap than the Euronext, but even more so bigger than the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges. Looking around I can't find any data supporting the list. I also notice OP listed a whole bunch of exchanges, and uses the [Stock Exchange Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange_Group) for the London one, which is more than just the LSE. [Most top 10's I can find look like this](https://www.tradinghours.com/markets) or similar. Different order than OP's for sure.

I appreciate the idea of this post. And I realise it's fluff and saturday entertainment. But for a sub that should value research like no other, it's a bit disappointing. Hopefully it lacks a bit of depth because OP put all their effort into doing DD for their portfolio ;)"

I mean... ok, I don't love the preponderance of Confederate statues in my neck of the woods. And it made me kind of sick when I went to Biloxi in 2008 to do some post-Katrina rebuilding, and the first house to have been fixed up was Jefferson Davis' house. Y'all know he's not coming back to use it any time soon! But like... Robert Clive... has a *statue*... right near Whitehall. He let more people starve to death than even Stalin did... and he has a statue. I can't figure humanity out I guess."

2021-04-25 09:29:47,stocks,"Contracts similar to options have been used since ancient times. The first reputed option buyer was the ancient Greek mathematician and philosopher Thales of Miletus. On a certain occasion, it was predicted that the season's olive harvest would be larger than usual, and during the off-season, he acquired the right to use a number of olive presses the following spring. When spring came and the olive harvest was larger than expected, he exercised his options and then rented the presses out at a much higher price than he paid for his 'option'.

The 1688 book Confusion of Confusions describes the trading of ""opsies"" on the Amsterdam stock exchange, explaining that ""there will be only limited risks to you, while the gain may surpass all your imaginings and hopes.""

In London, puts and ""refusals"" (calls) first became well-known trading instruments in the 1690s during the reign of William and Mary. Privileges were options sold over the counter in nineteenth century America, with both puts and calls on shares offered by specialized dealers. Their exercise price was fixed at a rounded-off market price on the day or week that the option was bought, and the expiry date was generally three months after purchase. They were not traded in secondary markets.

Options contracts have been known for decades. The Chicago Board Options Exchange was established in 1973, which set up a regime using standardized forms and terms and trade through a guaranteed clearing house. Trading activity and academic interest has increased since then."

But even then, the P/E we see in that kind of stock is STILL around 30 aka much higher than intel. Alright, let's talk statistics, the RSI for intel is currently hovering around 30(the oversold range), 20s always trigger bounce backs due to mass overselling.

2021-04-25 12:43:33,stocks,"AMD barely even competes with NVDA right now. Any discrete or data center GPU growth is just a bonus for them; most of their GPU business right now is in integrated and embedded (think laptops and consoles), along with a Samsung partnership for mobile SoCs.

NVDA's ARM chips aren't even competitive with what AMD or INTC have now, much less with what will be there in 2023 and the entire ARM merger looks at risk of being called off.

Now ARM itself may be a risk, but NVDA's efforts there are nonexistent for the next couple of years and basically irrelevant for at least a couple of years after that. Amazon and Google's efforts to develop custom silicon are much more concerning for the next several years, and I still don't think those are particularly concerning yet given the growing TAM and available marketshare growth for AMD.

FWIW I think Marvell is the best ARM server play if you're predicting an ISE migration. Their Thunder X2 was pretty legit and their roadmap looks good.

If you're in NVDA it should be for CUDA or their networking offerings. Any server CPU story is much more speculative and less interesting than the current AI/ML, automotive, or smart NIC plays."
2021-04-24 20:38:29,stocks,I don’t think AMD is crippled by TSM’s throughput at all.  The chip shortage issue is a different domain. Auto industry is at the top of the list not the CPU market.

> fabs falling behind

Can't be helped when you're an all-in-one shop, unlike AMD which are designers - yet that advantage propelled their sales in this dry shortage, unlike AMD. Intel even worked on video cards during this time, while the rest of the industry's customers are starving due to AMD and nVidia being unable to deliver.

>acquisitions busts

Can't be helped, related to poor management.

I completely agree yet the context is favorable in that their main competitors are strangled and unable to capitalize on their weakness. It is the perfect time for intel to get their shit in the next gear."

That's a good thing in *any* company's book. They didn't spend the money on CEO premiums or other garbage. They targetted future growth, reinvested their money. That's exactly what they should be doing.

CPU market was not affected by this lack of production rate (I’m not saying effect is zero but it’s negligible compared to auto industry) because the end user of the chips TSMC had the production problem with are mainly auto industry and some other small sectors that use those kind of chips.

1 - Learn as much match as possible. Minimum is algebra + lower division statistics. Ideally you should try to reach calculus. Why? Problem solving ability. At that level, you can pretty much model anything into numbers. You dont need calculus directly, but the practice on the way there is very valuable.

2 - After you have at least the minimum math, read a basic financial account book. You dont need to do end to end, but you need to be able to understand GAAP (generally accepting account practices). That will help you understand the financial documents companies release. It wont always apply to every company, but once you understand the basics, everything else can be derived.

3... from here you need to do more specialized research into specific sectors and business types. 

Thats a start at least. Not sure what level you are on honestly."

2) Look at their recent news, any controversy, fallen through deals, or big positive deals? For instance Altria fell pretty hard after the nicotine limit on cigarettes was limited recently.

3) Look at current cultural climate, are people driving more EVs, are people going to the movies more, is there an anti-smoking craze going on, etc. For instance movies are expected to do well with things reopening.

4) are there any analyst sentiments you can check on? Is this a hyped stock? How did that compare to the sector? E&Trade has a handful of analyst sentiments; bullish, buy, hold, etc. So far they haven't let me down.

5) likely the most important, do you like the company? And why do you like the company? Is it personal, do you think they have a good product, do you like their marketing or their approach to things?

As far as the discount rate to use, it's always wise to lean towards a more conservative choice. Long-term corporate bond yields would be my choice with an additional risk premium based on the company in question.

They have acquired back in 2012 Danisco expanding their biotech in food product production. Danisco is considered as one of the top manufacturers of a thickening agent utilised as a stabiliser in multiple food products. It’s technology in polymer and ownership of kevlar, tyvek etc. Gives DD an incredible stronghold in numerous fields due to their respective markets.

Market value is also commonly used to refer to the market capitalization of a publicly traded company, and is calculated by multiplying the number of its outstanding shares by the current share price. Market value is easiest to determine for exchange-traded instruments such as stocks and futures, since their market prices are widely disseminated and easily available, but is a little more challenging to ascertain for over-the-counter instruments like fixed income securities."

No, it's value in your eyes is $10, it's value in my eyes is $1000, it's market price is (or in your definition, it's market value) is $505, and it's real value is unknown (but likely somewhere between $10 and $1000)."

Basically RSI wants to equilibrate at 50 and the stock will go up or down based on that. 

Generally for high conviction stocks I either 1) wait until RSI indicates that is' a good time to buy (below 50 is perfect but 50s and 60s can be okay too. If I find an opportunity to buy below an RSI of 40 that's the dream) or 2) put a limit buy for slightly below current price.

There are limits of course as the market isn't just a math game. It's very easy to get into a value trap just looking at RSI. Alternatively, sometimes stocks hit the ""overbought"" cut off at 70 and keep climbing into ridiculous territory in the 80s and 90s. Happened with HD recently."

All that would also drive the price of copper and steel much higher, which is an equally sized position for me as oil. So I’m totally fine with this event.

On the other hand, the price of copper and steel will probably slow the timeline. EV cars take up to 3x more copper according to Freeport Mcmoran, 3x-10x according to copper.org.

The infrastructure is not in place to sell all these EV cars. That will take a huge push if it’s going to be this decade. That’s more copper again. 

Nobody seems to be factoring in used cars. People keep their cars for a decade and then sell them to other people. IIRC the average age of cars on the road is about 16 years. So, widespread adoption will require used EVs. 

Not many are considering the weather limitations on EV. I live in Colorado. The current batteries aren’t good when the temp is below 30F or 20F. 

Finally, a lot of money can still be pulled out of a declining industry. Nobody can see the future so maybe some oil companies take over a big part of the green energy. There are 6000 products the use oil. Look at the plastic we through away.

Given the current low rate environment, bonds have become a lackluster investment. Rates have reached the lowest they have had ever, and it seems we have bottomed rates.

Here’s my thought. Why have bonds at all right now? If rates rise, won’t the principle value of the bond go down? I mean unless you hold the bond until maturity, which long term bonds suck right now.

Wouldn’t it be better to have cash over bonds right now? At least with Cash, you have opportunity to buy at a discount when we see a correction.

1. Fundamentals: Can't post pictures here but look it up on YCharts. 

I generally use PS Ratio for growth tech stocks. Definition: PS Ratio = Price / Revenue Per Share (Note: YCharts uses the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Revenue Per Share in the denominator). Most growth tech companies are as low as 10 on the low side up to 30. Generally I try to catch companies I'm bullish on around 10; 2.7 is stupid low. This is the biggest streaming company in China and is avidly sought after by Tencent. Massive market and massive growth industry. Their PS is crazy low. The Price to Book Value is also fucking awesome for a growth tech company. Value investors look for companies less than 3 and this fits that parameter. This company is also jacked to the gills with cash. Check out their balance sheet. As of Q4 2020 their total assets are 12.4B and their total liabilities are 2.6B. They have 3.2B in pure cash. Year over year this company is putting out blow out numbers but their Q4 contracted a bit vs their Q3 of last year. But seriously: 3.2B in cash and the market cap is just over 4B. What kind of absurd mismatch is this especially when it is a money printing business too.

2) Technical/Price-Action/Analyst stuff: (had a picture from TD Ameritrade analyst reports)

6 Analysts projections: upper-bound is $29 and the median price target is $25.66. The stock jumped today a bit on news that the stock just got a buy rating: HUYA shares are trading higher after 86 Research upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy and announced a price target of $22 per share. We all know analysts are a bunch of pencil pushing idiots so take that with a grain of salt. Currently the price is $18.5 AH and it hasn't traded this low since July of 2020. The price was north of $35 as recent as a couple months ago. It has been consolidating at the $18 level waiting for news which brings us to the meat and potatoes of this post.

3: Proposed merger and Arbitrage strategy: The two biggest streaming companies in China are HUYA and DOYU. The King Maker aka Tencent is trying to merge these companies as they will dominate and have 80% market share if the merger is successful. Tencent has a major stake in both companies and a huge vested interest strategically as they are a video game company (among other things) and this would have vertical integration characteristics. If the merger goes through each DOYU share will be converted to .75 HUYA shares. The arbitrage strategy here is going long shares on DOYU and people shorting the hell out of HUYA. The amount of short interest on HUYA shows that the market is confident the merger will go through. If it DOESN'T go through then HUYA will no longer be shorted and the stock will sky rocket. If the merger DOES go through then you'll have a stake in the biggest streaming company in the biggest streaming market on planet earth.

4) Headwinds: China used BABA to send a message to monopolistic behavior. This was great news for the HUYA/DOYU merger because the uncertainty surrounding Beijeng's agenda was lifted a bit. Major companies, including Tencent, came out publicly to say they will make concessions where necessary. I expect this will hasten the negotiations between Tencent and Beijeng to get this through. The current time table for this merger to happen is the first half of 2021, which we are well on our way to the 2nd half. It is possible for this to happen in the 2nd half if negotiations stall. The other slight headwind is that DOYU is embroiled in some online gambling concerns but this is completely short run shit that gives me a better discount.

5) Institutional ownership: 52.4% of outstanding shares are owned by institutions. The two biggest players are ARK and Morgan Stanley. Fintel shows Morgan Stanley increasing their HUYA stake by 169% in the most recent filing to 22,095,743 shares (32% of the comany). Ark has the next most with 11,600,993 shares for 13.99%. (Check Fintel Huya Institutional ownership for this info)

6) Short Interest: Check the massive SI on this ticker. (Check shortsight for this info. free to subscribe and get daily updates)

34.4% of the float is shorted and 52.4% of the outstanding shares are owned by institutions. That leaves a fairly small left-over float size to publicly trade.

Mama CWood loves the stock. Massive institutional ownership with Morgan Stanley just making a huge investment. Pending merger. Artificially suppressed aka arbitrage short. I LIKE THE STOCK. I am playing the HUYA side with long calls and shares. It is a win win if the merger does or does not go through.

PART II:

The fact that institutional ownership shows as 121.4% everywhere for HUYA stock made me go down this rabbit-hole. (this is found in many places, google it to confirm)

I really wanted to be lazy and gloss over this fact but not today. If you check out the following link: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huya/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huya/institutional-holdings)

You  will see the current institution stat is: 100,952,393 Total Shares  Held. This makes sense as the current share float to the public  (including institutions) is around 83.491 million shares. (121.4% of the  float). (I had this picture from shortsight data but can't post pictures on this thread).

34.4% of the float is  shorted which is 28.72 million shares. Let's be conservative here and  assume that 100% of the shorted shares are institutions playing the  arbitrage strategy. Subtracted 28.72 from the public float of 83.491  gives us 54.771 remaining shares. Now the fucking crazy part is that if  you take the overall institutional ownership of 100,952,393 Total Shares  Held minus 28,720,000 you get 72,232,393 shares held as long holds. The  float size is 83,491,000 and if you subtract out 72,232,393 you get  11,258,607 shares remaining. This 4.4 billion dollar market cap has  11.256 million shares out of the 83.491 million shares owned by us  retail gamblers.

Practically the  entire company is owned by inside investors and institutions with an  incredibly small amount left over for us to play with. It is insanely  shorted. The fundamentals are the prettiest thing I've ever seen when it  comes to analyzing stocks.

Now I just need to decide if I sell out of literally everything and put it into HUYA"
2021-04-25 09:24:42,stocks,"Great analysis. Chinese authorities is cracking down hard on anti competitive behavior at the moment. If the combined market share of DOYU and HUYA is 80% after the merger, that may be cause for authorities to block the merger. In that case it would be a play on HUYA only. Which is still not a bad position as you have shared."

Or is it just that 1 share always equals 1 share lol. I‘m just very confused rn sorry"

2021-04-24 22:31:29,stocks,"Gotcha. On another note then, are you essentially saying it’s better to sell after losses than hold for a recovery?

2021-04-24 22:57:00,stocks,"No, not at all. It depends on your situation. Do you need the money? Otherwise if you don't, you're better off just holding through. Good companies will eventually recover in most scenarios during a windfall in prices"
2021-04-24 23:45:42,stocks,Excellent advice. Thank you for this and attaching a term to it. It made sense in my head but wasn’t sure if it was a legitimate strategy.
2021-04-25 01:26:59,stocks,"This is the way. I follow a lot of stocks. And whenever I have money to put into the market, I’m usually down on a couple of my holdings. So I average down on those so they can start being profitable sooner. 

Quick math for newbies:
You buy one share at $100.  You’re average is $100.

It drops to $50. 
Now you buy another share. So you have two shares and are in $150. You’re average share price is $75. 

Now when share price goes to $90. You have two shares so you’re at $180. So you’re up $30. Whereas if you haven’t bought the second share you’d be down $10."

They won’t Google the simplest of questions before going in there with finger diaherrhea wanting the answers and some lame ass people are happy to feel important to sit there and type out all the answers for them. Also made me understand why Suze Orman Dave Ramsey et al  is so prickly sometimes. Must be exhausting holding everyone’s hand answering the same question time after time. 
Point is, some people are layyyyyyzzzzzzeeee. If they can’t open a brokerage account themselves you have to ask why. The answer is they refuse to take responsibility for their life and will therefore blame you for taking the responsibility they refuse to. Don’t do it. Don’t do the work for other people. You won’t be their hero."

2021-04-24 22:35:52,stocks,"Well, you didn’t make any investment whatsoever. He made a terrible investment after insisting he give you his money and use you as free labor. 

You shouldn’t worry about the financial side of things in this case since it wasn’t your money to begin with. You may need to worry about personal problems, but even then you’re still not in the wrong.

To be completely blunt and honest, you don’t need to worry. It was his call, not yours."

2021-04-24 22:48:31,stocks,Did you tell him what you were investing it in and how? If I were investing someone else's money (I wouldn't) I would tell them exactly what it's invested in and not touch jt

2021-04-25 00:06:30,stocks,I agree. I’ve done the same thing. Every time I have to just give the money back and I get left with the investment. It’s like giving away a free option.
2021-04-25 01:37:58,stocks,"Tell him that if he wants his money back, you would have to sell for a loss, therefore locking in his loss permenantly.

Then ask for your management fee...LOL"

2021-04-25 02:52:58,stocks,Since you don't have the proper licensing it's also technically illegal but it's small and with people you know so whatever... The question I have is about taxes. if you made money on that how pays the taxes? you or him?
2021-04-25 02:59:27,stocks,What did you invest in? Why not something low risk?
2021-04-25 04:19:24,stocks,If you really didn't want to do it what you should have done is just open up another account and place it in and Index Fund

2021-04-25 06:43:40,stocks,What did you invest in that went totally bankrupt? I can see losing like 50/75% on a gamble but 100% loss?
2021-04-25 07:38:25,stocks,"Seems like everyone involved is a moron. Don't invest others' money--especially if you don't know what you are doing. Your mom should realize you're not a professional, and is her fiance incapable of opening an account on his own?"
2021-04-25 10:14:14,stocks,"I'd invest others money under two conditions: 

1) I have a positive track record for at least couple years. 

2) They are fully aware of possible losses, tax cuts of profits and we write that down together. 

No reason not to play hedge fund but be aware wtf you re doing."
2021-04-25 13:01:54,stocks,"Sorry to hear this. Your mom’s fiancé is an asshole to be trying to get his “money back”. That only happens if the investment works out. 

Frankly your mom was also an idiot to force that on you. 

I would NOT pay this asshole back. I would write a letter how annoyed you are to be put in this untenable position. You did not want to do this (you rejected the idea initially right?) but were brow beaten into doing it. 

Add a part that clearly states EVERYONE serious about investing knows there is inherent RISK as well as reward. Risk means you can lose it all, and you MUST be prepared for that possibility. 

I would also add in your letter that this is for your mum and your fiancé to figure out because: (a) they pressured you (b) they were not sensible enough to understand the risk ALL investment has (c) you should not pay for their bad decisions even if you did lose the money. That would be like asking for a refund on your stock because it went down. It’s ridiculous and these “adults” are being ridiculous. 

It’s their problem to resolve now. Most likely the fiancé will have to write that $1000 off as a valuable lesson. Or if your mum wants to be a doormat/take some responsibility for putting you in this awful position (I’m sure it was well intentioned but it was very uncool of her to do this) she can give him 50% on your behalf. In reality they’ll just work it out among themselves. 

If this causes real tension between them, enough to threaten the marriage, then you are all lucky you found out the true colors of the fiancé early on and she may want to reconsider plans."
2021-04-25 13:22:19,stocks,+1 never invest other ppl's money. The gains are theirs but the losses are yours.
2021-04-25 13:29:15,stocks,Maybe he should have signed a legal document stating that he was agreeing to risk his money. Whether he signed it or not it you could technically have just opened an online savings account and made a little interest on it and given it back.
2021-04-25 13:39:46,stocks,100%. I don't give out financial advice or talk much about my plays either. I don't want to accidentally lead someone down a bad path and have them lose it and blame me.
2021-04-24 21:59:12,stocks,If you lost the entire amount he invested with you then obviously you have zero risk management skills and you should have to pay it all back because you were a idiot to take it in the first place.
2021-04-24 22:12:37,stocks,Don’t use the phrase “caved in”. If you didn’t want to invest his money you wouldn’t have taken it. And I bet you had some type of deal going where you get profits if you make a lot. And you might’ve had a deal you’re not talking about where you should help with the losses
2021-04-25 07:12:29,stocks,you can do it if you dont do it like an idiot and you did it like an idiot
2021-04-24 20:26:20,stocks,How’d you lose it all
2021-04-24 20:41:38,stocks,It's also quite illegal.
2021-04-25 01:16:53,stocks,Well it’s also illegal.  You need to be a licensed professional to take others money
2021-04-25 03:02:48,stocks,"What about the other way around, do you owe them money, if you cash out, when their positions are red, and harvest the tax losses?"
2021-04-25 00:58:44,stocks,"It’s just as stupid to have someone who isn’t a professional invest your money on your behalf. If you would have made him money, you wouldn’t have kept it? So there’s no reason you should pay him back now that it’s been lost."
2021-04-24 23:35:20,stocks,"I also agree when it goes the other way. As i have experienced some jealousy from the trade working out for a coworker. So, I put in like a thousand bucks, and they put in ten thousand. I was super excited to have 4k. He ends up with 40k, and buys a benz. I was super in debt with school loans so I was very jealous."

2021-04-24 20:12:35,stocks,It depends on the underlying agreement. If its a personal loan then should be ok.
2021-04-25 13:10:06,stocks,"This fiancé is an asshole for not owning this as an “adult”.

You can see couple of recent beat on estimate. The value does not improve a lot even after a 100% beat. It is not reasonable at all. If you can be so sure to have it for 5 years, then it is not a growth story. And 10 years?

It's all about joining the EV bubble itself.  It's VW's turn:

While I think that retail is not even close to being strong enough to pump or dump a big stock like VW (and therefore would not consider your posts a p&d) this kind of vocab or behavior taints your posts, especially if I'm not the first one to notice this. Of course it's your decision how to write your posts, but I would change the approach if I was you."
2021-04-25 10:06:24,stocks,"What?  You seriously think the EV bubble is one big pump and dump?

The European stock VOW is a big stock, although foreign call options could still be bought in European stock markets.

However, the American ""depository receipt"" VWAGY is not a big stock; it has a low float."

2021-04-25 10:17:21,stocks,">  it is only traded as a DR in the US

During the recent hype, it has been VWAGY's rise that has somehow triggered a corresponding rise in VOW, not the other way around.

It's just like trading the warrants of an EV SPAC."
2021-04-25 11:17:05,stocks,"The reason for this is that most Europeans rather trade US stocks than ""home"" stocks. Furthermore, the amount of people that trade stocks is higher in the USA than Germany if we take the VW example - not only in absolute but also in relative terms. Only ~7% of the whole German population invests in individual stocks, compared to ~40% in the US. That means only a few people trade VW at home but way more people overseas - that's why European markets follow US markets"

2021-04-25 14:23:26,stocks,"Depends on you. If you are willing to try and pick your own stocks, there are still reasonably priced stocks out there, even in the US. If not, EM and even Europe (but mostly EM) have much lower valuations. If you are worried about inflation, you could try and buy gold miners. I'm not a fan of buying the gold itself. I like my cashflows, but prices are already high, so there is downside there as well.  
Traditionally bonds would protect you from market volatility, especially 20+ year government bonds, but with interest rates this low they don't provide much of a hedge. There are MM and HFT's that benefit from volatility, but their business models are often unproven and obscure.

Personally, I'm doing a little bit of everything. I'm picking my own stocks. I got some US value, some EU value and a lot of EM's got some gold miners and trading firms in there. I'm not holding any cash. Cash is trash ;) and so is bonds. I'm looking to buy some long-term government bonds, but I need to see yields at 5% before I buy."

Shroom stocks like [removed] and Compass Pathways are biotech companies working on synthetic and non hallucinogenic pharmaceutical compounds derived from psychedelic compounds strictly for medical use. Cannabis stocks are marketing consumer packaged goods for the average person. Atai is an incubator for multiple pharmaceutical companies working on synthetic compounds derived from psychedelics, for example they own 25% of Compass Pathways. Also the timeline for even the most promising drugs some of these companies have, like Compass's synthetic psilocybin compound which received breakthrough therapy designation, will still take at least 2-3 more years to get approved for the general market. Anyone who is approaching ""shroom"" stocks in a way that isn't treating them as clinical stage pharmaceutical companies has no idea what they are doing. I don't follow the recreational ""shroom"" stocks if there are any because there is no real market for it. Psychedelics are not for recreational consumption in the same manner as alcohol and cannabis are and people can grow them for pennies in a trash bag in their closet. Not like cannabis where it takes skill and knowledge as well as considerable resources to grow high quality medical grade flower for example."

I do believe that most people would prefer to have some of the benefits with an extremely mild or no trip involved. I don't think you can compare micro dosing to taking Zoloft.

2021-04-25 15:10:44,stocks,"If a company spends $1 Billion a year to make $1 Billion profit, is it worth more or less than a company and spends $10 billion a year to make $1 Billion profit?

If they just pay out the profits, then they're worth the same, the price of $1 Billion cashflow.

But usually companies reinvest part of their profit, and a dollar increase in spending by the smaller one is likely to result in a larger productivity and revenue and profit growth than the larger one. So next year if they've reinvested half the profits, one will spend $1.5B to profit $1.5B and the other $10.5B to profit $1.05B.

Your payouts over a  few years, assuming they keep reinvesting 50%, in Billions:

2021-04-25 19:08:23,stocks,"It's basically seen as returning value to shareholders: by spending their extra cash to increase the value of their shares (by reducing supply). And often there's a plan laid out ahead of time so investors know the money has some amount of money earmarked that can be used for buybacks over some time period. What I have mixed feelings about is executives with bonuses tied to hitting share price targets and then make decisions regarding spending money on share buybacks vs something else that might create more value for shareholders long-term. 

The obvious alternative is dividends, but investors tend to like predictable dividends and once you raise it then it becomes an expectation."

2021-04-25 07:36:41,stocks,"They are almost identical. They are both market cap weighted so as a result 95% of VTI is VOO. Only 5% of VTI is those other thousands of companies.  So yes you get a tiny bit of diversification with VTI. VTI also has a slightly lower dividend yield since those smaller companies aren’t known for their dividends. 

You can’t go wrong with either as long as you know that you are mainly getting S&P. 100% S&P with VOO and 95% S&P with VTI. 

You can also split it up and do 70% VOO, 20% VXF, 10% VXUS. This is just an example, obviously. 

VXF is extended market, so anything other than S&P, smaller companies. Another one here is VO which is a bit more growth oriented. Either VXF or VO are good complements to VOO. 

VXUS is international exposure outside of US."

2021-04-25 19:28:55,stocks,"PE is not everything, Beware.

the most recent quarterly report has intel profit margins dropping and volume dropping dramatically in server CPUs. Intel says the server CPUs is a seasonal issue of the companies just not buying this quarter, a one-off.

AMD quarterly report is tuesday. We will see there if intel is correct, or if AMD has in fact taken market share from intel in its most profitable sector. This would not be surprising, as AMD server CPUs are cheaper and have higher throughput on benchmarks in the last year, all while using less power. This advantage is forecasted to continue.

If profit margins drop and sales drop, earnings per share drop, and instead of a PE of 10 it becomes a PE of 15 with literally no stock movement.

No one disputes that intel is the bigger company, and also that intel's laptop cpu sales were strong in the stimmy enconomy, this quarter. However, they have the inferior products and inferior (higher) prices. They are standing on brand recognition, legacy contracts, and output capacity alone.

Maybe one day again they will be top dog, but every indication says intel will be losing market share in at least two of their most profitable markets, desktop computer cpu sales and server CPUs."
